P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, good morning, the Court is in session.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President, good morning, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your examination-in-chief continues. 
WITNESS RCB2,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF(continued)
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness, in order for us to continue, I would like you to remind me of some answers that you gave to my questions yesterday, answers relating to your positions.  Yesterday you said that it was, indeed, around the end of the month of May that you found yourself in the positions you held in the Muhima sector.  
Is that correct? 
A.	We joined the Muhima unit and we were deployed at the Avenue known as Avenue des poids lourds and that neighbourhood was known as Kiovu des pauvres. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness, was it at the end of May -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Shall we get the spelling?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The spelling of that avenue, please?  Do we have it? 

Was it Avenue des poids lourds?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, indeed, that is it, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, that's known to us.  

Please proceed.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, there was also Kiovu des pauvres.  I don't know whether it's correctly reflected on the record.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Was it, indeed, at the end of the month of May that you found yourself in that position which you just mentioned? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	For how long did you hold that position? 
A.	We held that position until the 3rd of July. 
Q.	From the position you held, Witness, can you tell the Court the approximate distance between you and the enemy forces? 
A.	Please give me some time to enable me to remember.  I would say that between us and the enemy positions, the distance was about 2 to 3 kilometres.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  From your own position, that is, the position of your squad, was it possible to 
see -- or, at least, to carry out patrols around the Panafrique hotel?  Do you know the Panafrique hotel? 
A.	The Panafrique hotel was near the Sainte Famille church; I knew that hotel well. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I believe the Hôtel Panafrique is not -- doesn't pose any problem regarding the spelling.  It is true that I do not have it on the spelling list, but I think there will be no difficulty in spelling that name.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, when your troops patrolled around the Panafrique hotel, did you notice that the hotel was still operating or running while you were in your position? 
A.	I think I went to that hotel twice, and I was able to notice that the hotel was running.  
Q.	When you say it was running, does that mean that there were clients at the hotel?  Is that what you mean to say? 
A.	I did not go into the rooms of the hotel, but when I passed in front of the hotel, I saw people having a drink in the bar.  
Q.	Thank you.  In spite of the fighting that was going on between your forces and the enemy forces opposite you, the people of that area carried out or went about their normal duties.  Is that right? 
A.	No, most inhabitants of Remera and other neighbourhoods where fighting was going on came to seek refuge in that neighbourhood.  But the inhabitants of the neighbourhood in which we were, stayed in their houses, apart from a few of them who went to the Sainte Famille church in order to seek refuge there.  
Q.	Witness, considering the exchange of gunfire between the belligerents, was it possible to hold meetings in that area in the front line area where you were?  Was it possible for people to assemble in that area in order to hold meetings? 
A.	That was not possible. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did you carry out patrols around Sainte Famille between the 16th and the 
17th of June 1994? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And during those patrols, did you notice any incident in the said area? 
A.	I think it was on the night of the 16th to the 17th of June, when we heard gunfire coming from the 
Sainte Famille area.  This was at about 5 a.m.  We went to the Sainte Famille church and there we met corpses.  
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, the gunfire you heard, which were the forces involved in the exchange of the said gunfire? 
A.	In the morning, I went with three gendarmes and were able to notice that the inhabitants of that area had fled, but when they saw us arrive, they came to meet us and told us that RPF troops had come, and that they had shot at the inhabitants of the area.  They also said that the troops had abducted some people.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did they also tell you that -- 
MR. MOSES:
I'm sorry, Your Honour, just the beginning of the question, "Did they also tell you", I'm afraid, is a lead-in to a leading question.  Yes, the question should be phrased, "Did they tell you anything else or what did they tell you?"
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, depending slightly on the continuation, such a beginning is risky.  

What is your question then, Maître Nekuie? 
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I'm going to rephrase my question.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	When the residents described to you the attack carried out by RPF troops, did they tell you about any reaction from the government forces? 
A.	I do not clearly understand the question, Counsel.  Can you please repeat it? 
Q.	I'm going to do that, Witness.  The RPF forces that attacked during that night, did they face any resistance? 
A.	The residents of the area told us that there was no resistance.  RPF troops came and shot and also abducted some refugees.  
Q.	Thank you.  Can you remind the Court of the exact date when you made that observation?  Was it the 16th or the 17th of June?  We should be clear on that.  
A.	We heard the gunshots at about 4 a.m., so it was on the 17th of June.  So, as I said, it was at about 
4 a.m. when I heard the gunshots and it was the following day in the morning that I went to the location to find out what had happened.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And for how long did you stay at the site in order to make that observation? 
A.	There was a parish at that place.  There were also schools, so I had to go into all those buildings.  I'm not sure, but I believe I stayed there for about one-and-a-half hours.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you notice that there were wounded persons amongst those who were there? 
A.	Yes, there were wounded persons amongst them.  
Q.	Were there many? 
A.	The wounded were many.  I believe the attackers had launched many grenades.  There were many wounded people, in fact, some people were even dead.  
Q.	And were there many people who died -- or were there relatively a small number of people who died? 
A.	I saw a few people who died, but the residents told me that some of the dead had been buried by the members of their families.  But I would tell you that I was able to see between 15 and 20 bodies.  
Q.	Thank you.  While you were making those observations, did you see Mr. Tharcisse Renzaho, préfet of Kigali-ville, did you see him at that location? 
A.	No. 
Q.	After you made your observations, what did you do next? 
A.	I was with three gendarmes, so I sent two of them to the commander of the Muhima company to report to him the events.  Then, I returned to my position; I left the other gendarmes at the site.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  In the course of that day, did you ever return to that same site? 
A.	No, I did not return there, but other gendarmes went to the site in the evening.  
Q.	When you say, "In the evening", what are you referring to?  Was it in the afternoon or was it really in the evening? 
A.	I sent gendarmes between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. to find out whether there were any residents there or whether they had all left.  On their return, the gendarmes told me that there were very few residents who had stayed in the location.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
I'm sorry -- Mr. Witness, was it on the 18th of June or the 17th of June? 
THE WITNESS:
It was on the 17th of June.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, did the gendarmes tell you in their report that Mr. Renzaho was also at that location, in addition to the residents of the said location? 
A.	I do not know whether you're referring to the gendarmes, which I sent to Muhima, or those that I sent on patrol at the Sainte Famille church.  But, in any case, no one told me that Mr. Renzaho was at that location. 
Q.	Yes, Witness, I'm referring to the gendarmes that you sent on patrol at the Sainte Famille church.  Did they tell you that Mr. Renzaho was also at that site since you had already left? 
A.	No, they did not tell me anything of the sort.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And in the days that followed that incident, did you continue patrolling around the Sainte Famille church? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Did you have the opportunity of meeting Mr. Renzaho in that location while you were on patrol? 
A.	I never met Mr. Renzaho in the course of the patrols that I carried out.  
Q.	For how long did you patrol that area?  I mean, in the course of one day, for how long would you patrol in that area? 
A.	We started our patrols at 6 o'clock, and we would return at 10 o'clock.  Then, we would send another team at 2 p.m., and that team would return either at 5 p.m. or 6 p.m., and then we would stay the night in our position.  
Q.	Thank you.  If -- during those patrols, if an authority like the préfet of Kigali-ville was in the location, would that have gone unnoticed as far as you were concerned? 
A.	If I had met him on that site, I would have noticed him, and if the gendarmes I had sent had seen him, they would mention that to me, but they did not do that.  
Q.	Thank you very much indeed, Witness, and that was my last question in my examination-in-chief.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I've concluded the direct testimony of this witness, thank you -- come to the end of the direct testimony. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Prosecution.  
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, am I correct if I summarised your position that you were a junior officer in the gendarmerie?
A.	That's correct.  
Q.	And did you ever see the Accused, Tharcisse Renzaho, from the 7th of April through till the beginning of July 1994? 
A.	I did not move about often, so I never saw him during the period referred to. 
Q.	And it's fair to say that he would have been dealing with persons in the gendarmerie not of your level -- not as a criticism of you -- but he would have been dealing with more senior officers in the gendarmerie.  Isn't that correct? 
A.	Yes, if he needed to -- or have recourse to the gendarmerie, he would have contacted my superiors, not me.  
Q.	Now, you've told us that at Remera there was -- there were more than 100 gendarmes.  Is that correct?  Prior to the 6th of April, three groups of 37, I think you had said.  
A.	Yes, that is what I said yesterday.  
Q.	And when you moved to the Kacyiru camp, it was still operating, wasn't it? 
A.	I did not go to the Kacyiru camp, I went to the Muhima camp and it was then that we were sent to that position, which was at the Avenue des poids lourds.  I never went to the Kacyiru camp.  
Q.	When you went to the ETO, that was still functioning, wasn't it, as a gendarmerie camp? 
A.	Are you referring to the ETO camp?  When we went to the ETO, what you had there was a brigade -- the Kicukiro brigade and the brigade was still operating.  
Q.	Thank you.  And when you arrived at the end of May at Muhima, am I correct that at Muhima there was based the Kigali mobile group of approximately 265 gendarmes? 
A.	I do not know the number of troops who comprised the Kigali mobile group.  I was based in Remera, and thereafter I went to Kicukiro and later on to Gikondo.  It was around the end that we were posted to the Muhima task force.  Therefore, I do not know the number of gendarmes who were in that mobile group you mentioned.  
Q.	All right.  Now, would you agree with me that prior to the 6th April there were roadblocks that had been established throughout the city or around the city of Kigali that were manned by gendarmes? 
A.	Personally, I never saw a roadblock manned by gendarmes during the war.  
Q.	Well, prior to the 6th of April? 
A.	In fact, those were not roadblocks, they were checkpoints for vehicles.  Those checkpoints were manned by gendarmes, and the said checkpoints were at the place called, quote, unquote, 
19 kilometres.  Therefore, it was not a roadblock to check people, but rather a checkpoint for checking vehicles.  
Q.	You're telling us that you saw no gendarmes on roadblocks at all from the 6th of April through to 
July 1994, is that your evidence? 
A.	Gendarmes never manned any roadblock.  Gendarmes were in given positions and carried out patrols.  I never saw any roadblock manned by gendarmes throughout the period of the war.  
Q.	Are you aware, Witness, that the gendarmerie had a specially trained and equipped unit to take down roadblocks, known as the Jali -- J-A-L-I -- group? 
A.	I believe that unit existed.  I heard people talk about it, but I was not -- I was never a member of the said unit.  
Q.	Well, as a gendarme were you familiar with the statute setting up the gendarmerie? 
A.	Not really. 
Q.	Well, were you aware that the gendarmerie nationale was an armed force set up to maintain order and to enforce laws?  Were you aware of that? 
A.	Yes, I was aware of that.  
Q.	Were you aware of the fact that members of the gendarmerie could, when absolutely necessary, resort to the use of firearms when they or other persons are victims of violence or assault?  Were you aware of that? 
A.	I did not clearly understand your question, Counsel.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Were you aware, Witness, that members of the gendarmerie, such as yourself, could, when absolutely necessary, resort to the use of firearms when the gendarmes or other persons were victims of violence or assaults?  
MR. MOSES:
For Your Honours and for the record, I'm referring to Prosecution Exhibit P. 8 and this is from section 8.  But I didn't want to show the witness -- I'm simply going to go through a number of matters, and I think it's quicker if I do it in the way in which I am.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You said P? 
MR. MOSES:
P. 8.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Sorry, Witness, did you hear my question?  Were you aware of the fact that gendarmes could resort to using firearms in those circumstances? 
A.	In the context of their duties, gendarmes could react for self defence -- legitimate self defence.  I was fully aware of that.  
Q.	And were you aware that gendarmes could also use firearms to disperse a crowd? 
A.	They could not use loaded firearms.  There were other means that they could use in order to disperse a crowd.  
Q.	So you're not familiar with the legislation which provides authority for gendarmes to use firearms in those circumstances? 
A.	Gendarmes could not use firearms that were loaded to shoot at the local population.  They could use tear gas or water cannons to disperse crowds, but not bullets.  
Q.	Well, were you aware that the legislation provided that members of the gendarmerie nationale may resort to the use of firearms without prior authorisation from authorities when the crowd or the rioters have either carried out attacks aimed at killing, acts of destruction, looting or attacks on public buildings?  Were you aware that you could use your firearm in those circumstances? 
A.	The question is too long, Counsel, I did not clearly understand it.  
Q.	Well, I'm suggesting to you, Witness, that the gendarmerie nationale statute, in fact, authorises gendarmes to use firearms when -- without prior authorisation -- when crowd or rioters carry out a number of things, including attacks aimed at killing.  Do you agree with me that the act provides for that? 
A.	Gendarmes must be discerning in their exercise or performance of their duties.  When it becomes necessary to save the life of someone who is going to be attacked, the gendarme may use all means available to him to disperse the assailant.  
Q.	Now, would you agree also that the gendarmes -- their functions include endeavoring to arrest ringleaders of disturbances and persons who have committed criminal offences? 
A.	Yes, they have that right.  Gendarmes must arrest those who commit crimes and hand them over to the competent authorities.  
Q.	Between the 6th of April and the 3rd of July, Witness, how many persons did you arrest? 
A.	I've already told you the positions which I held, and the patrols that I carried out.  When I was at the Avenue des poids lourds I arrested somebody who had a weapon and handed that person to my superior; that is the only person I arrested during the period you just mentioned.  
Q.	Now, yesterday you said that the killings were happening at night, not during the day.  Is that really your position, Witness?  The killings that were taking place in Kigali were only happening at night? 
A.	Yesterday, I told you that I did not personally see any members of the population being killed.  In the mornings, when I began my patrol I would see dead bodies, but I never saw anyone being killed; that was my testimony yesterday.  
Q.	Now, you were a trained investigator, is that right?  Do I understand from your evidence yesterday, a trained investigator? 
A.	From the time hostilities resumed, we stopped the investigations.  
Q.	So you didn't carry out a single investigation of a single killing that you saw?  Is this what I understand? 
A.	It is necessary to put together an entire file in order to conduct an investigation.  But because we were at war, we did not have the time to conduct an investigation which ordinarily requires a lot of time and resources.  
Q.	Were you a gendarme in October 1990, Witness? 
A.	Yes, I was.  
Q.	Did you take part in the arrest of several thousand Tutsis who were held at places, such as Nyamirambo stadium, without files? 
A.	I was not in Kigali at that time, I was at Rwamagana.  
Q.	Okay.  Well, even without investigating, would you agree with me that a large number of the bodies you discovered in the mornings were found by roadblocks?  
A.	Not only near roadblocks, dead bodies were found everywhere -- on the roads, in the villages, but one could not know who had killed those people.  
Q.	Well, can we just focus for the moment on the bodies by roadblocks.  You'll agree that there were bodies by roadblocks; can we agree to that? 
A.	I have already told you that I saw dead bodies everywhere.  Which particular roadblock are you referring to when you talk about dead bodies near roadblocks?
Q.	Just listen carefully to the question.  All I'm asking you, yes or no, did you see dead bodies by any roadblock in Kigali in the course of your duties? 
A.	No.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This answer, Mr. Witness, referred to which time period? 
THE WITNESS:
The Prosecutor asked me whether I saw any dead bodies near roadblocks during the war.  My answer related therefore to the dead bodies that would have been near roadblocks.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So your answer includes the period from April to July '94?  You are not now referring to October '90? 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I have not understood your question properly.  Would you please kindly repeat it? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
In view of the exchange between you and the Prosecutor, I need to make sure that the communication is efficient.  You have said that you did not see any dead bodies by any roadblock in Kigali.  When you say that -- 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- listen, when you say that, does that refer to the period April to July 1994? 
THE WITNESS:
Between April and July 1994, I saw dead bodies, but the dead bodies I saw were not near roadblocks.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, only a matter of -- Witness, only a matter of two minutes ago, I asked this question: 

"Even without investigating, would you agree with me that a large number of the bodies you discovered in the mornings were found by roadblocks?"

And you answered: "Not only near roadblocks", and went on to say where else they were discovered.  

Why did you say "Not only by roadblocks" if you are now saying that you saw no bodies near roadblocks? 
A.	What I said is that I never saw any dead bodies near roadblocks.  I said that I had seen dead bodies, but the dead bodies were not close to roadblocks.  I saw the bodies all over, in the villages, on the roads, but I never saw any dead bodies near roadblocks.  That was my answer.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we have in two languages, both in French and English that you said not only close to roadblocks, Mr. Witness.  Is that a misunderstanding? 
THE WITNESS:
Wherever I went, I never saw any roadblocks.  I never saw any dead bodies near roadblocks.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Do you know what happened to Tutsis who went to roadblocks, Witness? 
A.	I have just told you that I never saw any roadblocks.  Why are you putting that question to me?  I have already answered that I never saw any roadblocks.  
Q.	So that we are quite clear and that there is no misunderstanding, are you saying that during April to July you never saw any roadblocks in Kigali? 
A.	When I left my position in Remera, I went to Gikondo and then later on, took up the position at 
Avenue de poids lourds and Kicukiro.  These were times of war and I was in charge of those positions to which I was assigned, and I was not in charge of roadblocks.  I've already told you that I never saw any roadblock.  
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, were you aware that there was a civil defence programme in Kigali? 
A.	I heard mention of the civil defence programme once over the radio.  
Q.	And what was the purpose of the civil defence, according to what you understood? 
A.	If I recollect properly, I believe it is Prime Minister Kambanda who talked about civil defence.  He said that each member of the population should protect themselves whenever they see the enemy.  But given that I was personally in charge of those positions to which I was assigned, I am not in a position to tell you how the civil defence programme was conducted.  
Q.	In the positions that you held with the gendarmerie, are you aware of any infiltrators that were arrested by the gendarmes? 
A.	I have not quite understood your question, which position are you referring to? 
Q.	As a member of the gendarmerie, in Kigali between April and July 1994, are you aware if any person was arrested as a suspected infiltrator? 
A.	Yes, I heard mention of that.  
Q.	How many? 
A.	I told you that I personally arrested one individual who was bearing a firearm.  We were at -- on duty in Mburabuturo in Nyamirambo, and some infiltrators were arrested by the Muvumba battalion.  
Q.	The name -- 
A.	At that time, three people were arrested. 
MR. MOSES:
I don't know if -- thank you.
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	So it was possible still to arrest people for certain things, wasn't it?  Despite the breakdown in the system that you've described?
A.	I have not quite understood your question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you told us that it was difficult to arrest people because of the war situation and you need a file to arrest someone.  Now, here you arrested someone in spite of the war situation.  Any comment? 
THE WITNESS:
I have no comment to make on that issue.  All I can say is that I personally arrested one person during that period.  
MR. MOSES:
Thank you.
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Apart from your visit to Sainte Famille or Saint Paul's on the 17th of June, were you aware that gendarmes went to Saint Paul's a few days earlier on the 14th of June? 
A.	I was not aware of that information.  If such a thing had happened, I would have known, because I was ************************************ you have just mentioned.  
Q.	All right.  Were you aware that Tutsi refugees were massacred at Sainte Famille on the morning of the 17th of June, later in the morning? 
A.	At that time, I was at Sainte Famille.  It is not only Tutsi who were killed.  Tutsi and Hutu alike were among those killed.  When the RPF shot at the refugees who were at Sainte Famille, both Tutsi and Hutu were killed.  
Q.	I'm talking about at a later period of time in the morning.  It would have been a time after the time that you said you had left Sainte Famille.  Were you made aware of an attack later that morning by militia and others, including gendarmes at Sainte Famille? 
A.	Please repeat your question.  
Q.	You told us you arrived at about 5 o'clock in the morning on the 17th of June at Sainte Famille, correct? 
A.	No, I told you that I arrived at 6 a.m. 
Q.	All right, and you stayed for an hour and a half, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So I'm talking of the period after you had left -- after 7:30 in the morning, were you told of an attack by militia and gendarmes on Tutsi refugees in Sainte Famille? 
A.	I was never given that information and such an attack never took place.  
Q.	Okay.  Have you met the Accused since you left Rwanda in 1994? 
A.	I met him in the camps in Zaire, yes, I can confirm that I met him in the camps in Zaire.  
Q.	And were you fighting with the Accused in the Congo in the years from '94 to 2000? 
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President -- Mr. President, I think that we need to return the favour to our friends opposite, because when we raised this issue yesterday, we were reminded that they are not in any way related to the matters before the Court.  So I don't think we should broach issues that are outside of the scope of this trial.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will come back to your request for admission of the document after this evidence.  For the time being, we overrule the objection.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Was he one of your superiors in the armed forces in the Congo during that period -- any portion of that period? 
A.	You know that refugees are not entitled to go to the battle front, and by the way, as refugees we didn't have the resources that would enable us to fight.  
Q.	All right.  So I take that -- your answer to that question as "no"? 
A.	Yes, the answer is no.  
MR. MOSES:
I've got no further questions, thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Re-examination.  

No re-examination.  
JUDGE ARREY:
Witness, look at me, I'm asking you -- I'm talking to you.  You said you went to Sainte Famille at 6 a.m. on the 17th of April 1994 and you left at 7:30 a.m., is that right?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct.  
JUDGE ARREY:
And you were told that some of the people killed by the RPF, that the corpses had been buried by their relatives at that early hour.  Is that what you told us? 
THE WITNESS:
I was told that the corpses had been picked up by members of the family and relatives, and people who were concerned by that.  But I do not know whether the bodies were buried.  
JUDGE ARREY:
And the last question:  Are you sure you were in Kigali during the genocide, Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
I was in Kigali during the war.  
JUDGE ARREY:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That was the end of your testimony, Mr. Witness.  We would like to thank you for having come the long way to the Tribunal to testify, and wish you a very safe journey home.  

Should you wish to meet with the Accused that will be arranged by the witness protection unit.  Thank you very much indeed.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will then ask that the next witness be brought in.  

Meanwhile, there is a pending issue concerning the report which was referred to by the Defence yesterday in connection with the previous witness.  The Defence wanted to tender it as an exhibit, and we deferred our ruling until we have had the opportunity to read this Garreton report.  

We have now done so.  We see that part of the report refers to the mandate of the Tribunal, other parts do not, but still the report may provide a context.  The OTP has asked a couple of witnesses about the Accused's activities in the Congo afterwards; this is arguably relevant.  The witness knew of the report and there is no problem with the authenticity of the report.  And we will therefore admit this document as the next Defence exhibit, which is then, Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA:
D. 60. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
(Exhibit No. D. 60 admitted)

1000H
(Witness entered courtroom)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You will be referred to as Witness PGL in these proceedings.  You have to tell the truth and the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
(Declaration made by Witness PGL in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have a document with your signature in front of you, Mr. Witness, haven't you?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can see the document, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the information in this document is correct; is that so?   
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 61.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal.  
(Exhibit No. D. 61 admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, I would like you to order a closed session for the testimony of this witness, because the questions that I am going to ask him revolve around his person and occupation.  Therefore, they may lead to his being identified if I put the questions to him in open session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No problems with that.  We note the position of the witness, and we will go into closed section.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 15 to 48] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness GOA, we are now in open session and your examination-in-chief continues.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness GOA, how often did you leave your home during that period to go to your parents' home? 
A.	I did not count the number of times.  But going to my parents' home was like going to my home, so although we did not live in the same location, my parents' home was my home.  So I went there regularly to find out how my parents were doing, but I cannot give you an exact number of times on which I went to my parents' house.  
Q.	The roadblocks that you say were erected by the population, with the collaboration of some secteur officials, at times were these roadblocks essentially or basically manned by civilians? 
A.	Let me tell you that at the beginning, the roadblocks were used or set up as a military strategy.  Then later on, some of the people who were at the roadblocks took advantage of them to racketeer members of the population who went through the roadblocks, and to steal in the surrounding neighbourhoods of the roadblocks.  

As far as I'm concerned, security was being provided by soldiers, and yet those who manned those roadblocks to my mind were like bandits.  And I can give you the names of some people whom I recognised at the roadblocks.  However, let me tell you that there were some very well-known civilians who manned the roadblocks and committed offences at those locations and mistreated members of the population who went through the roadblocks.  
Q.	Those people you have referred to, Witness, did they work in collaboration with the officials of the cellules or the responsables of the cellules whom you referred to a short while ago? 
A.	As I have already told you, I saw one Selemani, Gatete, and one Ndanda, who were often in the company of the conseiller of Biryogo at the Gitega roadblock.  I was able to recognise one Ntwari, who was there and another one known as Abdou.  

All those people whom I have mentioned were self-declared leaders of the roadblocks.  But as far as I'm concerned, they were not providing security for members of the population.  In fact, they were doing the opposite.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
There are four names.  Can you help us with them, please? 
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, those names are not on the list, Mr. President, because we did not have much time to work with the witness.  

Gatete is G-A-T-E-T-E, Gatete; Selemani, S-E-L-E-M-A-N-I; Ndanda, N-D-A-N-D-A; Ntwari, N-T-W-A-R-I.  And there was also Abdou.  I heard the name Abdou, and I would suggest that the witness, who mentioned that name, should spell it.  
THE WITNESS:
A-B-D-O-U.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, did you have the opportunity to notice that these people were also working or acting under the orders of the préfet of Kigali-ville? 
A.	No.  
Q.	At the time, did you already know the préfet of Kigali and were you in a position to know whether they were acting under his orders? 
A.	All I can tell you is that at the time I was a student; I was not a politician; I did not belong to any political party.  But I was interested in the things that were happening in my country, and the situation in my neighbourhood.  

Now, as far as the préfet goes, I knew him as préfet of Kigali-ville.  But I cannot say that I saw him during that period or that he came to chair any meeting whatsoever in our neighbourhood.  
Q.	At that time, Witness, did you listen to the radio? 
A.	Yes, I listened to programmes over the radio.  
(Pages 49 to 50 by Jean Baigent)


















1600H
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Did you have the opportunity to hear a message from the préfet of Kigali-ville asking the inhabitants to set up or man these roadblocks?
A.	No. 
Q.	When you say that these people acted in collaboration with some officials of the cellule or the secteurs, as you said, was this an observation that came to you ordinarily, or is something that you observed only as you went on the main road, which you have described? 
A.	You see, I never knew that I was going to answer these questions and write down any names for that purpose.  But as I went often on that road from Nyakabanda to Gitega, I have mentioned the example of houses that were looted and no measures were taken to check that.  But Conseiller Karekezi was present, and there were others collaborating with him.  He was one of the officials who spent the entire day with members of the population.  

Apart from that person whose name I have already mentioned, I did not see any others.  And it is not on all occasions that I saw him, but it was only when I went from Nyakabanda to Gitega that I had occasion to see him. 
Q.	For how long did you go along this -- undertake this journey?  How many months, approximately?  
A.	I went through that road throughout the entire period I was in Kigali.  I always had to go to the residence of my parents to find out how they were faring.  I told you that I left Kigali on the 4th of July. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you must kindly stop repeating that you have told us something previously.  We remember everything here.  There will, by necessity, be some repetition.  Here comes the next question.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	When you left Kigali on the 4th of July, what was your destination, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I went to the Bulinga commune at the Gitarama préfecture. 
Q.	Did you remain in Rwanda since that date? 
A.	No, I did not continue residing in Rwanda. 
Q.	Was there any specific reason why you did not remain in Rwanda? 
A.	Because of the war, everybody, and particularly myself, had to move to avoid being killed.  As the fighting advanced, I had to move to areas where no fighting was taking place yet.  
Q.	Since you left Rwanda, Mr. Witness, have you been concerned or disturbed because of the events that took place between April and July of 1994? 
A.	Problems are always there.  Even today, I still face security problems.  I do not feel I am safe, as I would like to be.  If that could have been the case, I would have returned to my country. 
Q.	Were you prosecuted personally regarding these events -- in connection with these events?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
That was my last question, Mr. President. The examination-in-chief of the witness has been concluded.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Is there any cross-examination of this witness?  
MR. MOSES: 
I will be brief, Your Honour. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, you testified for the Defence in Karera -- the Karera trial, didn't you? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And at that trial you testified that you didn't see Mr. Karera during the genocide, correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And you testified that you didn't see the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge during the genocide, correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	You testified that you didn't see any soldiers or policemen taking part in the looting or killing of civilians either, correct?  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And today you are testifying that you didn't see the préfet of Kigali during the events of April to July, correct?  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	You did see policemen, didn't you, at the secteur offices? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And you saw gendarmes in the area also, correct? 
A.	As far as that is concerned, I must say that gendarmes are different from soldiers.  But they all form part of the military organisation, so they could all be described as soldiers.  But -- but to avoid any misunderstanding, I must say that I also saw policemen looting, and I also saw soldiers. 
Q.	Good.  Thank you, for that.  Now, your parents left their house in Kigali in the secteur that you have told us they were living in and went to Gitarama, didn't they? 
A.	Nibyo.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, could the Prosecutor please repeat his question for the French interpreter?  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	My question was that your parents left their house in Kigali, in the secteur you have told us they were living in, and went to Gitarama, didn't they?  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  But I must specify that if my parents went to Gitarama, that did not stop me from monitoring the house, even though my parents had left.  Maybe I did not explain this fact.  But even after my parents left, I was still obliged to visit the house to find out how things were at the house.  
Q.	When did they leave Kigali?  Perhaps a month?  
A.	These things happened ten years ago.  It's even more than ten years, and I cannot remember with clarity the date when they left Kigali.  All I know is that they left Kigali to go to Bulinga.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question was whether you remembered the month.  Was it in April or May; do you remember?  Maybe before?  
THE WITNESS:
I cannot remember the month for now.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Well, once they did leave, how often would you go and visit their house:  Twice, three, four times a week, every day?  
A.	I did not write the times when I went to that place.  All I know is that I went there very often, but I cannot tell you how often I visited that place. 
Q.	Was it more than once a week? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you remember being asked in the Karera trial, a question was put to you by the President?  And that question was:

"Mr. Witness, how many times did you actually leave your house per week?  Say, in April, per week, how often did you leave the house yourself?  Did it happen every day?" 

And your reply was:

"If you take into consideration the layout of the neighbourhood, there was no particular problem.  I could go out and see the neighbours.  But going out of the neighbourhood was more complicated.  I could not go out frequently.  I could do that, for example, once per week."  

Do you remember that question and that answer that you gave?  
A.	I do not remember clearly the question that was asked, and the answer that I gave, but your question did not specify the place where I had to go.  But I told you that the Nyakabanda and Gitega secteurs were two neighbouring secteurs, and I do not remember the various areas where I went, particularly since I did not know that I would have to come here and answer such questions.  Even if during that period there had been insecurity and everybody was afraid and movements were limited, I made an effort to go and visit the residence of my parents.  That is all I can say.  
Q.	You didn't stop in Biryogo secteur on your way from your brother's house to your parents' house, did you? 
A.	I had to go through Biryogo, but I was not obliged to stop because I had nothing to do there in the Biryogo neighbourhood. 
Q.	You weren't from that secteur, were you? 
A.	You are right.  I was not a native of this Biryogo secteur.  
Q.	In fact, you were a student studying in a different town altogether at that time; correct? 
A.	You are right. 
Q.	Yet you feel able to speak with some authority about the authority that the préfet may have had in Kigali at that time? 
A.	All I can say on this particular point is that there was a widespread insecurity, and even if we were not primarily concerned or personally concerned, since I was just a student, I had to know what was the situation in my locality.  Maybe I did not take note of the details, but in my capacity as a Rwandese who was living in the locality, I was concerned by the security situation of the neighbourhood.  And this was a war situation. 
Q.	You saw Conseiller Karekezi with policemen, correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	How many policemen did you see him with? 
A.	I can't give you a specific figure because I was not aware at the time that I will have to answer such questions.  I think I could have seen him with three or four policemen; and the other people who were with him could also have been wearing a uniform, but I could not identify them. 
Q.	Now, do I understand -- is it correct to say that you saw him addressing the population, who obeyed him? 
A.	As I said before, this was a war situation and everybody was concerned with his or her own security.  I cannot say that I took part in any of the meetings that he is reported to have organised.  When I saw him, he was moving around, and the Biryogo road was a road that many -- it was a very busy road, and I saw him several times moving around.  I did not take note whether, or what he -- I did not take note of what he was saying to the people nor know what their activities were at the time.  All I can say is that I saw him. 
Q.	Did you provide a statement to the Defence on the 1st of April of this year? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, could you please repeat your question?  
Q.	Did you sign a statement that was provided to the Defence for Mr. Renzaho on the 1st of April this year? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And in relation to Mr. Karekezi, did you say in that statement that, "I saw him frequently moving around accompanied by his policemen and addressing the population, who obeyed him"?  
A.	That is what I was saying a while ago.  During such occasions I was on the road and I was going by, but I did not go and listen to his speech because I did not have time for that.  I did not have time to listen to what he was saying because I was not concerned.  I was, rather, concerned by the problems in my parents' residence where I was going.  So I did not take note of what he was saying, but I would like to say that I saw him. 
Q.	From what you observed, the lines of administrative authority had not broken down, had they?  People were still obeying authorities.  
A.	All I can say is that, at one point, some groups of bandits appeared and wanted to take advantage of the situation, and some members of the population, who were near the conseiller, could obey him.  But we realised that there were some -- there were some slippages, but these were just things that I saw in passing.  

Actually, in the various secteurs, some members of the population took advantage of the situation to steal, and claimed that they were trying to ensure security.  But, as far as the conseiller is concerned, I saw him moving around, but I never sat near him to follow or listen to what he was saying.  
Q.	In that same statement you signed on the 1st of April, you went on to say regarding Mr. Karekezi that, "He encouraged the population to man the roadblocks erected, and requested them not to make any concession to the infiltrators who had just been discovered."  Now, is that something which you recall saying in your statement to the Defence?  
A.	Could you repeat what you have just read out, Mr. Prosecutor?  
Q.	In respect of Mr. Karekezi, you had also said in your statement that, "He encouraged the population to man the roadblocks erected, and requested them not to make any concession to the infiltrators who had just been discovered."  Is that something you said to the Defence?  
A.	I would continue telling you that when I went through the Biryogo secteur, I realised that some stores had been looted and the conseiller, Amri Karekezi, who had been present, had taken no measures against these acts.  I believe that he was in a position to do this.  He could have prevented the population from carrying out these acts of banditry.  
Q.	Who was the conseiller's superior in the préfecture, Mr. Witness?  It was the préfet, wasn't it?  
A.	I have no idea.  
Q.	All right.  Mr. Karekezi remained as conseiller of that secteur until July, also, didn't he? 
A.	I cannot give you the date when he stopped acting as conseiller, but all I can say is that I saw the situation I have described.  And, in June, the situation had worsened.  And I told you that I left the city on the 4th of July.  I can, therefore, not answer your question.  All I can say is that the fighting had become very serious in July, so I had to leave the town. 
Q.	You were a young male Hutu and you had no problems crossing the roadblocks, did you? 
A.	I did not have any problems, but that does not mean that I was going around without any problems.  Everybody who was carrying identity cards -- or identification papers, or who had nothing to fear, could go around.  I was not the only one who was moving on the roads in Kigali. 
Q.	The Tutsi in Kigali weren't so fortunate, were they, Mr. Witness?  They were being targeted at the roadblocks and in their homes, or didn't you see that either? 
A.	As far as that specific point is concerned, I can say that it is God himself who protected people in Kigali because everybody -- people who did not have identification papers, were known.  And if you -- maybe you have not well followed up the situation in Rwanda.  It's as if it is the Tutsis that were fighting the Hutus.  

There is a problem that I might not have talked about, but I will prefer to spare you the details because that may take us in another direction.  But all I want to say is that Hutus also encountered problems.  Tutsis are not the only ones who had problems.  Bandits could refer to you as a Tutsi because they wanted to steal from you.  Even if I was going around, I was also concerned for my own security.  And if I did not have any problems, it's just because I was lucky.  If people survived that situation, I think they were just lucky.  And those who were not lucky, died.  
MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, I have basically finished my cross-examination.  There is one small point I just wanted to elicit from him, the witness, in closed session.  It's only a matter of a couple of questions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  We will move into closed session.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 57 to 59] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera). 
(Pages 51 to 56 by Judith Baverstock)

















MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness KRG, we are now in open session and your examination-in-chief continues.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, please tell the Court the circumstances you experienced at the time the war broke out, the war you just mentioned a short while ago? 
A.	I have not quite understood your question.  Do you want me to tell you the situation or to narrate the situation from 1990 or from 1994; that is, beginning with the 1994 war?  
Q.	Witness, I understood that your earlier reference was to the 1994 war, and my question was in relation to April 1994.  So I am referring to the 1994 war, Mr. Witness.  Do you now follow?  
A.	Yes, I do.  The war resumed on the 6th of April 1994.  We had just learned that President Juvénal Habyarimana's plane had just been brought down by the RPF-Inkotanyi.  An announcement was made over national radio telling the population that a state of emergency had been instituted and the minister had announced over radio that all inhabitants should remain in their homes.  This was a release from the ministry of defence issued on the 7th of April 1994.  As far as I am concerned, the war officially started with the broadcast of that announcement.  
Q.	When you heard that announcement, Witness, did you personally comply with the instructions from the ministry of defence? 
A.	Yes, I personally abided by the instructions of the ministry of defence.
(Page 60 by Judith Baverstock)
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      

1645H 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	So you remained at your home following that announcement, and am I to understand that all the other members of your family remained at home?  
A.	After that announcement, most members of the population complied.  However, Tutsis were being killed, and people fled their homes.  On the 8th of April, my family and myself sought refuge at CELA.  Later on, our conseiller said that everybody -- or, that any house that was not inhabited would be destroyed because it was a reflect -- or, rather, the fact that the homes were not occupied would be an indication that those people were Inkotanyi accomplices.  So I was compelled to return home and to prepare food and take to my family members who were at CELA.  
Q.	On which day did you return to your home, Witness?  
A.	I did not stay at the CELA myself.  I went there to provide food to my family members who were there, and everybody was forced to go to the roadblocks to ensure security.  And from time to time I spent the night there.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, you accompanied your family to CELA on the 8th and then returned to your home on the same day; is that the situation, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, why did your family choose to remain at the CELA while you returned to your house on that day?  
A.	I would like to tell you that it is not only my family which went to live at CELA.  If I were to give you all the reasons for -- for the question you have asked, I am afraid I might be disclosing my own identity.  So let me simply say that all members of my neighbourhood, that is, all the inhabitants of my neighbourhood went to seek refuge at CELA.  
Q.	The inhabitants of your neighbourhood whom you have referred to, Witness, were they afraid of some special danger?  And why would it have been so?  
A.	I have already told you that from the 7th, Interahamwe had started to kill Tutsi, and even Tutsi women who were married to Hutus.  And this did not only occur in my neighbourhood, it occurred across the country.  So women, children, and young girls began to flee our neighbourhood to go to CELA.  Even the young people who were opposed to the MRND party went to seek refuge at CELA.  Killings within the population had already begun, and the youth who were opposed to the MRND party were being chased after, because they had been referred to as accomplices of the Inkotanyi.  
Q.	Thank you for that answer, Witness.  Did you know the members of the population of your neighbourhood who sought refuge at CELA?  Did you know any of them?  
A.	Yes, I can give you the names of my neighbours who sought refuge at CELA.  But I am afraid that by mentioning their names I will be disclosing not only my identity, but also theirs.  And in that way everybody would know the person who has testified before this Court.  
Q.	I understand you very well, Witness.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
And from the witness's answers which relate to himself and to his family, I would like to apply that we return to a closed session, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you have other sequences which would require a closed session, or is this the only one?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
I will be putting some questions that require that we proceed in closed session, given the answers we are receiving from the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
My question was not correctly interpreted.  I will try again:  Do you have other portions, other sequences of the examination-in-chief which will also require closed session, or is this the only portion where you need closed session?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
My line of questioning will focus on the witness's family.  And because he is not comfortable speaking about these issues in open session, I -- I believe this is the only line of questioning I have to the very end, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
To the very end -- with other words, the remainder of the testimony needs to be conducted in closed session; that's what you are saying, isn't it?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right, we will move into closed session, then.
