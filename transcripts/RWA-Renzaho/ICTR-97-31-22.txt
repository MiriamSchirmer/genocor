MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, good morning.  The Court is in session.  

There is a slight technical problem, but that can be sorted out in parallel with the commencement of the proceedings.  

Good morning, Dr. Des Forges.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecution:
ALISON DES FORGES,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, at the break on Friday afternoon we were trying to locate a document which is Prosecution Exhibit 25.  It is under tab 20 of the first volume of documents.  Do you recognise that document, Dr. Des Forges?  
A.	Yes, this is a letter from the prefect, Colonel Renzaho, to the chief of general staff of the army.  It is subsequent to the document which we examined on Friday pertaining to civilian self-defence.  And this document forwards to the chief of staff a list of several hundred persons, along with the -- their location in the city -- persons who are to be relied upon in the civilian self-defence programme.  

I would note that if you turn overleaf after the first cover sheet, where the list itself begins, that you will see under the initial heading the listing of commune, secteur, and cellule, indicating that the standard -- or the usual Rwandan administrative hierarchy is being put into play for this civil self-defence system.  
Q.	Thank you.  Dr. Des Forges, on page 9 of your report in the English version, it's under -- it's on page 11 of the French, under the heading "New government and the genocide", you say that, "The new authorities hurried to dispel these concerns in a meeting of préfets on April 11 and through radio appeals for Hutu unity broadcast by the minister of defence and influential politicians on April 12.  They stressed that partisan interests must be put aside in the battle against the common enemy, the Tutsi." 

What I would like your comment on, Dr. Des Forges, is whether that was a theme which was a common theme during the early days of the genocide; namely, that interests -- self interests had to be put aside in the battle against the common enemy, the Tutsi?  
A.	Indeed it was a repeated theme in radio broadcasts and in popular meetings as the authorities and political leaders attempted to ensure that the tensions, which I spoke of originally in the historical section -- the regional tensions, the partisan tensions, and even the economic class tensions -- not distract people from what was the essential concern:  The battle against the Tutsi.  And here I would recall a phrase in the document -- in the September 1992 document, which is commonly called "The definition of the enemy document," in which there is specific reference to the distraction of people from the ethnic conflict by other concerns such as partisan and regional concerns.  So that was a major issue for authorities and political leaders at the start of the genocide, and then again at the end of the genocide where we begin to see substantial amounts of violence among Hutu. 
Q.	Was it made clear by persons in positions of authority at the beginning and during the genocide that it was, in fact, the Tutsi who were the enemy? 
A.	It was made clear in a variety of ways by the use of coded references in general, and by, on occasion, more blatant and straightforward language, particularly on the part of certain political leaders, less so on the part of the administrative authorities, and then again particularly through the mouthpiece of RTLM. 
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, I would like you, please, if I could, to turn to Prosecution Exhibit 57.  It's under tab 11 of the radio broadcasts.  It's the broadcast of the 11th of May 1994.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, my apologies, but I was not able to hear the reference of the document my learned friend wishes to refer to, especially since I cannot locate it in the list of documents which were given to us by him on Friday.  What is the specific document, if you please?  
MR. MOSES: 
It's Prosecution Exhibit 57.  It's found under tabulation 11 in the folder of material of radio broadcasts.   
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Do you have that document in front of you, Dr. Des Forges? 
A.	I do. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you found it, Defence?  This is probably, in English, K number, K0271979.  
MR. MOSES: 
Yes.  
MR. CANTIER: 
I am there.  I thank you.  
MR. MOSES: 
Just for my friend, I will be referring to, where applicable, the French transcripts and the page, paragraph, and the line reference for both English and French to assist all parties.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	First of all, just in passing, Dr. Des Forges, do you note on, I think, pages 11 to 13 of the English -- and it's pages 13 to 16 of the French -- in that transcript there is an interview with the Accused Renzaho? 
A.	I see that. 
Q.	And then starting on page 14 of the English and page 16 of the French, is there an interview on Radio Rwanda there with Rwajekare, spelt R-W-A-J-E-K-A-R-E? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	Do you know who Mr. Rwajekare was, Dr. Des Forges?  
A.	He was a member of parliament and a bureaucrat in the administration. 
Q.	Looking firstly on page 16 of the English, the second paragraph, commencing on the fifth line -- and in the French it's on page 23, the first paragraph commencing at line 5 -- it states that:

"The people have understood that and are getting to face them and conquer them, for the problem is now clear.  It is the Tutsi who want to take over power again using manoeuvres. The people cannot allow the Inyenzi-Inkotanyi to take over again by force the power that they lost through elections.  If they do so, they will exterminate the majority.  The people are therefore determined to fight relentlessly against these Inyenzi with all their might and resources." 

Dr. Des Forges, are you able to comment on that passage and how it fits in with what you have just said regarding what persons in authority had to say about the common enemy?  
A.	This passage incorporates a number of significant references; first of all, the distinction between the people and the Tutsi.  It is frequent during this period for both authorities and political speakers to use the people as a term equivalent to "the Hutu", thereby excluding Tutsi from the circle of description -- from the discourse referring to ordinary Rwandans.  The -- it is the Tutsi and not the RPF referred to here in the first line as "those who want to take over", and again "to take over again".  The link between present events and the previous monarchical regime is an important theme throughout this period and here it is found again.  And then again the equation between Tutsi in that sentence and the parallel structure in the following sentence where the phrase is Inyenzi-Inkotanyi instead of Tutsi.  So, once again, underlining that Inyenzi-Inkotanyi equates to Tutsi.  Then, again, the warning that if the RPF wins, they will exterminate the majority.  

Beginning in 1991, there is the reference to genocide used by Hutu propagandists as meaning a genocide against the majority to be carried out by the RPF and/or the minority.  So, here again, that theme is struck with the idea that the minority will, in fact, be able to exterminate the majority.  The emphasis upon protection, self-protection, protection against an eventual risk of extermination, is the essential foundation of the system of self-defence; people are called to protect themselves against the danger of extinction.  
Q.	Thank you.  If I can ask you to look at page 19 of the English, in the second paragraph commencing at line 7; and in French it's page 25 in the fourth paragraph, commencing with the words, "The only remark, perhaps, is that the conseillers and the heads of cellules should show greater enthusiasm and collaborate with the people.  For, if you are teaching people to defend themselves, to face the enemy, if it is a government decision, it means that it has force of law at the local administrative levels, préfets, bourgmestres, conseillers, leaders of cellules and heads of ten households, youth leaders, and political party representatives; indeed, the defence problem is an issue that is of interest to every honest inhabitant of Rwanda, especially the Hutu, since he is the one facing the Inyenzi-Inkotanyi at the moment."  
MR. CANTIER: 
If I may, I -- the page you provided does not correspond to what you are reading out.  My learned friend, perhaps you could give me the reference per K number, which might be easier to follow than with the pages.  So, can I have the K number in the French version, please?  
MR. MOSES: 
My friend is quite correct.  I apologise.  It is page 23 not 25, commencing on the fifth line; and the K number is K0247765.  I apologise for that.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, are you able to comment in respect of this passage in regard to the matters you have been commenting on?  
A.	Again, the distinction between "people" and "Tutsi"; the idea in the final line that it is the Hutu who are facing the Inyenzi-Inkotanyi, in other words, that Tutsi have no right to be -- to feel themselves at risk, that it is only the Hutu who need to feel at risk.  And then the reference once again to the complete administrative structure from the préfet down to the level of the heads of ten households, the involvement of the political parties, as well as the administrative system, through the youth leaders -- that means, basically, militia and Interahamwe leaders -- and political party representatives.  And then, perhaps, most significant, the reference to this self-defence effort being a government decision, meaning it has the force of law, and administrators are those who have the authority, the force and the duty of enforcing the administrative regulations, and that is why the civilian administration is called upon  -- is implicated in the execution of this civil self-defence programme.  
Q.	Thank you.  The next portion I would like you to look at please is on page 21 of the English version.  It is the third paragraph, which commences, first point, and in particular from the sixth line downwards commencing, "Moreover, the people".  And, in the French, it is on page 23 -- I am sorry.  This time it's on page 25, the fourth paragraph commencing, "no interpretation" and, in particular, from the sixth line down.  Do you have the passage in front of you, Dr. Des Forges? 
A.	I do. 
Q.	I can just quickly read it:  "Moreover, the people must understand that there is only one problem now, the problem between the Hutu and the Tutsi.  Every Hutu, wherever he may be, must fight this war in collaboration with his brother, his sister, and his neighbour.  This is not a war between political parties.  There have been political parties, and I believe in multiparty politics, but for the time being, the general problem is the fight against the Inyenzi-Inkotanyi, against the Tutsi".  

Once again, Dr. Des Forges, are you able to comment briefly in respect of that quote? 
A.	It simply reinforces the earlier references to the distinction between Hutu and Tutsi and to the need for all Hutu to join together in fighting against the Tutsi, who are the problem.  

What I was doing, when I looked back at the beginning, was to check the date, because the -- it's very interesting that this excerpt is broadcast on the 10th of May, which is an indication of the continuing importance.  I am actually surprised that it is so late in the sequence of events, and indicates then a slight change in my own interpretation to find something this concerned with partisan -- possible partisan conflict at a period when the genocide itself is already well advanced.  So it's an indication of the continuing importance of this theme throughout the events.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are now in the English document.  Where do you find that this was transmitted on the 10th of May?  
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, I was referring to a table at the start of the index to these documents; this is tab 11.  It is identified as a transcript of a Radio Rwanda broadcast on 10 May, tape 970; and on the cover page of the transcripts it's identified as tape 970 with the month of May, although no date in the month of May is given.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So even if the date 10th is not in the document itself, it follows from the front page of the binder?  
THE WITNESS:
That is correct, Your Honour.  That was my reference.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This document we are going through now contains several interviews; two on side A and two on side B.  And we have so far concentrated on the interview by Mr. Rwajekare.  Do we know whether these interviews are for separate interviews or interviews during the same transmission?  
THE WITNESS:
I do not know, Your Honour.  It is not indicated.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But we do know that all four were transmitted on the 10th, or is it only the front page which gives us that basis?  
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, I have not read these with an eye to confirming the date from the content, but I will, during the pause -- or perhaps at lunch time, look for indicators within the content itself to see if that can help us to establish that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So far, it doesn't follow from the evidence that the interview with Mr. Rwajekare took place together with an interview, say, of Mr. Renzaho.  That we do not know yet, or is that something we will be informed of later?  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, the only point, perhaps, that I could direct Your Honours and Dr. Des Forges to is page 13 of the English, and I don't know the corresponding -- it seems to be the commencement of side B, which commences -- or recommences with a continuation of an interview with the Accused, and then there appears to be a journalist who comes in and commences interviewing Mr. Rwajekare.  There is nothing to indicate that they were together when the interview was conducted.  But it does appear that they are -- it is a continuation of the radio programme or broadcast.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
At least what we seem to possibly know now is that on side B we find a reference both to the Accused and to this gentleman.  But whether side B is a continuation of side A, we do not know yet. 
MR. MOSES: 
No.  I think that's a fair comment.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, I had not raised any objection because I was not aware of what my learned friend wished to achieve when referring to the interview of this gentleman, Rwajekare.  But it was clear in my mind, as is often the case with radio programmes we have in our files, people who were being interviewed one after the other.  Sometimes there are dialogues, but in my mind, it was clear that Mr. Renzaho was interviewed, and that subsequently -- and I don't know how long afterwards -- Mr. Rwajekare was interviewed.  That is how the Defence understood those transcripts.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  We may have further submissions on this later on.  

Do you want to continue on to this document or move on to the next one?  
MR. MOSES: 
One more point in respect of this document.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And, Dr. Des Forges, if you could please look at page 22 of the English, the second paragraph, which commences with the words "The first".  And, for the French, it's on page 26 and it's the third paragraph, commencing, (French spoken).  Dr. Des Forges, if I can just briefly read it.  It says:

"The first thing that Rwandans must understand is that they must fight in this war, that they must not always put their belongings on their heads and flee from the Inyenzi-Inkotanyi who do not even number one million, whereas the Hutu number about six million".  

Now the question I want to ask you is approximately how many soldiers were there in the RPF?  If you could tell us that, if you are aware.  
A.	The figure being used at the time of the Arusha Accords was less than 30,000.  
Q.	So the reference to Inyenzi-Inkotanyi "not even numbering one million", what in your opinion does that refer to?  
A.	Once again, that is a reference to the Tutsi as an ethnic group rather than to the combatant force of RPF.  

I would simply, on the question of -- from the President earlier about the date, I would say here that the phrase telling people "not to put their belongings on their head and flee" would at least, in part, confirm that this was a reference to the month of May, rather than earlier, because it was beginning at that time there were massive population movements that concerned the authorities, late April or early May, I would say, at least.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, Dr. Des Forges, looking at your report on page 10 -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you leaving this document now?
MR. MOSES:
I am.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Now, this Mr. Rwajekare, you said he was a member of parliament and a bureaucrat.  And that also follows from page 14 of this transcript.  It is stated on page 14 that he was a resident of Kigali town, a member of parliament, he came from Rushashi, he had worked in the ministry of foreign affairs, the ministry of justice.  Now, why is the statement of this Mr. Rwajekare of importance, a small apparatchik?
THE WITNESS:
It is important for a couple of reasons, Your Honour.  The transcriptions of the radio broadcasts, which have been preserved and are available to us for analysis, represent only a small part of the total corpus of what was broadcast during this period.  That makes it sometimes difficult to evaluate the tenor of the entire range of what was said at this time.  Finding a statement like this, which is so blatant in its ethnic overtones and in its incitations for violence against an ethnic group, is relatively rare.  It is of significance that it was broadcast on Radio Rwanda, rather than on Radio RTLM, because the national radio was Radio Rwanda; that was the voice of the government as opposed to RTLM.  And although many listeners did not make that distinction, it is still an important distinction to be made.  In addition, Radio Rwanda was the radio, because it was the authoritative radio.  It was the radio used by the prefects, not simply the Accused but other prefects, and other authorities at the national level, to deliver government orders to the population.  

So, here, yes, this is a minor apparatchik, in a sense, but he is a member of parliament, and he is speaking on the national radio.  It is certainly imaginable that a significant number of listeners, hearing a member of parliament expressing such ideas on the national radio used by authorities to deliver government orders, would easily assume that such statements did in fact represent the position -- the official position.  In addition, it is significant because this person, who ranks relatively low down in the hierarchy, probably, can help us to understand what was being said and thought by people who were not in the highest circles of authority.  And to the extent that his voice represents one line of thinking common at the time, it has significance.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. MOSES:
Is Your Honour happy for me to continue?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, looking at page 10 of your report, and it's page 12 of the French under the heading "Military", you say in the final sentence that "the military also provided arms, usually with the assistance of local civilian officials who passed on the firearms to individuals whom they regarded as loyal to the government and Hutu Power".  What, if anything, is wrong with passing -- the military passing on firearms to civilian authorities for them to pass on the weapons to other members of the population in a time of war?  
A.	The distribution of weapons and ammunition, and the dissemination of training needed to use those weapons, carries with it a responsibility to ensure that the weapons are used appropriately.  In a time of war, this means being used against combatant forces, armed and posing an imminent threat to the person in possession of the weapon about to be used.  When those weapons were being used, and it was clear they were being used at roadblocks, in massacres; for example, at Gikondo church and elsewhere in the city of Kigali, it was certainly clear, beginning as early as the 9th of April or even the 7th of April, that the firearms were being used against civilian targets chosen on the basis of ethnicity, then it was the responsibility of those who had distributed the arms to recall them or to discipline the people who were making use of them.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, further down on page 10 under the heading, "The administration" --  it's on page 13 of the French -- you say that "administrators were charged with establishing barriers and organising patrols to prevent Tutsi from fleeing".  Can I please ask you to look at Prosecution Exhibit 50; it is a radio transcript under tab 4, which, from the schedule, says the 12th of April 1994.  I believe this is the only transcript that I will be referring to for which there is no French translation, and for that I apologise to my learned friend.  

Looking at page 9, and commencing on line 2, this is the Accused speaking, where he says:

"We request of them to make patrols within their quarters like usual.  But it's all right in other areas.  We request" -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, we are sorry, but the interpreters are unable to locate the document Prosecution are referring to.  
MR. MOSES: 
If I give the K number - it's somewhat unclear on the -- K0216044.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you still in the transcript binder?  
MR. MOSES: 
Absolutely.  Absolutely.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you are saying that that is tab 4?  
MR. MOSES: 
Tab 4.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, tab 4 -- if tab 4 comes after the green page called 4, it is K02-something, and if it comes before the green page 4, it's K0357179, 11th of April.  But you want to go to a document dated the 12th of April.  
MR. MOSES: 
It's the first set of K numbers you just referred to, Your Honour, after the green tab --
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the page?  
MR. MOSES:
It has more easily recognisable a number and handwriting 632 bis on the top. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The document following after tab 4 is entitled, "Name of translator". 
MR. MOSES: 
Absolutely.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And then date of translation, 30th of July '96.  And you referred us to page 2 of that document?  
MR. MOSES:
Page 9, line 2.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
"We request".  
MR. MOSES: 
That's correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you all found it, page 9 of this?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Apparently the French booth has not yet found it, but they say it's all right.  Prosecution can continue.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  All we have is the English version.  Please go ahead.  
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	If I can just read a portion to you, Dr. Des Forges, and ask you to comment on it.  It commences:  

"We request of them to make patrols within their quarters, like usual.  They ought to come together and look for their traditional tools they are used to and defend themselves.  I would like to request of them now, each quarter should try to organise itself and make a -- communal work within quarters by cutting off branches" -- sorry, "bushes" -- "searching  empty houses, check out in the nearby swamps if no Inyenzi hid inside.  They ought to do all this so that they can get the hope that nobody hid inside.  They must cut those bushes, check in gutters and houses overgrown with weeds." 

And then the last sentence commencing four lines from the bottom of that page:  

"I wish them to keep on being courageous.  They should not listen to those who said that the town has been captured; instead they ought to be strong in their own areas.  Then they shall do the communal work so that no Inyenzi can hide there.  That's my message to the population." 

Are you able to comment at all in respect of that passage which I have just read?  
A.	Here on Radio Rwanda, the prefect of Kigali city is directing the residents of the city to unite and to look for their traditional tools.  I have remarked in my reports and elsewhere on the use of certain words which are found throughout the country with specific references to the genocide.  One such word is "tools", which means, in fact, "weapons".  And in speaking about traditional tools, the speaker means machetes, spears, bows and arrows, clubs and so on.  So we are not speaking here of an ordinary household tool, but rather of an implement to kill.  People are asked also "to cut off bushes, to search houses, to check swamps and to check gutters".  At this time, Tutsi who felt threatened were seeking to hide away from their homes in exactly such places:  In wooded areas, in gutters, and so on.  The effort to track down Tutsis in neighbourhoods was meant to lead to their killing and elimination in the city.  The reference to "communal work" is also significant because this was a standard practice in previous times; itself a benign practice for organising the people of a community to do physical labour.  And, here, that work is being used to clear brush and places that could offer potential places for hiding.  

The instructions were carried out.  Certainly, in several cases we have reference, for example, in a written document produced by a priest who kept a diary, and the same document was published in a journal called Dialogue, after the genocide, in which he refers to people coming to cut the bushes in the area surrounding the religious buildings where Tutsi were taking shelter. 
Q.	Thank you.  And the other point I omitted to read, which is on line 10 of that same page, commencing:  

"On the streets leading to their quarters, it would be a good thing to block them with roadblocks.  They can look after them, choose people they really trust and who have papers and put them there."  

How does that fit in with your comments that the administrators were charged with establishing barriers?  
A.	Here we see the directive carried down to the most local level, to the street itself, where people are called upon to put up roadblocks in order to impede the passage of passers-by and to check their identity papers.  There is a call to people to choose who they really trust, meaning those who share the ideas of the government, to be in charge of this effort to control the movement of the population.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, if I could ask you, please, to look at Prosecution Exhibit 62.  It's a radio transcript under tab 16.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What we just read was from Radio Rwanda, according to the table of contents.  Can you confirm that?  
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, I can confirm it only by saying that I have always seen it referred to as a broadcast from Radio Rwanda.  I do not have any independent verification, but I believe from the journalists -- I don't know if the journalists are identified in this one -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Bamwanga?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
B-A-M-W-A-N-G-A.  Where did he work?  
THE WITNESS:
I believe he was a Radio Rwanda journalist.  Also, if you look at page -- it's hard to read the K number, but what is in -- and handwritten at the top, 638 bis, or the typewritten number 3, you will see an extract of a notice from the head of Cyangugu prison informing the wardens that they must come back to work no later than "today, 12 April".  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's where we find the date, the 12th of April.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  And then the fragment below that, an announcement of a meeting also 12 April in Butare signed by the prefect of Butare préfecture.  And then, just below the extract we were looking at on page 9, or 632 bis, you will see that there is a directive -- a partial extract of a directive, also April 12, signed by the minister of interior and communal development.  Actually, that -- he was not actually the person who signed it, but it was signed for him.  And, again, an announcement from the prefects of Kigali préfecture. So I think there is no doubt that these broadcasts are from Radio Rwanda rather than from RTLM because of the official nature of these notices.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

You wanted to move onto a new document?  
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  It's under tab 16 of that same bundle of documents.  And this is where there was a new -- some new translations that had come through.  I don't know if they have been entered into your folder by your associates.  We delivered them on Friday.  

The English passage is on page 4, commencing on the second paragraph; the K number is K0377212.  And for the French, it is page 28, and the second paragraph -- 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And if I could read this passage to you, Dr. Des Forges, and ask for your comments.  The Accused says:

"Thank you, up to now we have given enough directives on identification documents, and I have repeated them on many occasions.  The identification document that is requested at the roadblocks is the identity card.  The inscriptions on our identity card are prescribed by law, and this has not been amended.  I would like to inform members of the population that there is a method the Inyenzi use to camouflage themselves. They send spies to the zones that are not under their control.  They often use Hutus or other persons who have identity cards bearing the Hutu ethnic inscription because they know that persons labelled as such will not face problems during the checks." 

What relevance or importance do you see in that statement, Dr. Des Forges? 
A.	First of all, the statement by Prefect Renzaho that he has given many directives on identification documents.  Second, the statement that persons carrying identity documents bearing the Hutu ethnic inscription will not face problems at the barriers, leading one to conclude that, obviously, those persons bearing Tutsi identity documents will face problems at barriers, and this coming directly after the statement by the prefect that he has many times given instructions to the people at the barriers on what to do with identity documents. So, I would say, a clear recognition on his part that people attempting to cross barriers with Tutsi identity documents will indeed encounter difficulties.  
Q.	Thank you, Dr. Des Forges.  Moving, if I can, onto page 11 of your report.  It's also under the same heading of "Administration" -- "The administration".  You talk about orders being handed down from the government to préfets and down the chain to other officials who read instructions from the government.  What's the importance of that, in your opinion?  
A.	The use of the administrative system to implement the searching out and killing of Tutsi is indeed a central part of the analysis of the genocide.  Here is simply a summary of the importance of the use of the administrative system to disseminate and enforce orders having to do with the location and the slaughter of Tutsi.  The orders were such orders as creating crisis committees, cutting down bushes, setting up barriers, and all of these things we know from the factual evidence were, in fact, implemented. 
Q.	Right.  Have you seen during the course of your research and reading of matters such as transcripts, any indications of the structure in the Kigali-ville préfecture operating during the periods of the genocide?  And what examples would you bring to the Trial Chamber's attention, if you have so noticed?  
A.	There is evidence from many sources.  Of course, there is the evidence of photographs, of testimony concerning the creation of barriers, the existence of barriers, people killed at barriers.  There is written documentation indicating the distribution of weapons being carried out by administrative authorities, the training activities being carried out in the civilian self-defence system.  There are accounts by outside observers from the International Red Cross, as well as from clergy, about such things as people being removed as they attempt to traverse the city at various barriers, about the cutting down of bushes.  So there is ample evidence of the execution of those orders, also, of course, the creation of the crisis committees or the security committees to carry out and implement these instructions at local level.  
Q.	Right, thank you.  Now, if I can refer everyone, please, to -- and you in particular, to Prosecution Exhibit 51.  It's under tab 5, it's a radio transcript.  In the schedule, it's dated a radio transcript of 14 April.  And for the English, I am looking at page 10, line 21.  And in the French it's page 21, the -- commencing on the final paragraph.  And it's -- in the English, it is K0111163.  It commences with the words:

"I wanted to tell you that about improving security, especially in fighting, lootings, thefts, killings, I held a meeting with the officials of political parties at the préfecture and communal levels.  That meeting was successful because we shared ideas and we found that those in charge of the citizens' problems must do their best to try and make citizens understand that those criminal actions are not ones that will allow us to win the war."  

Then I think we can perhaps leave the next sentence and recommence with the words:

"Then killing each other will not cancel the problem of Inyenzi-Inkotanyi.  We must, rather, unite our efforts since we are facing the problem of war in order to win that war.  That is why I thank very much the representatives of the political parties for the constructive ideas they gave us during the meeting.  And they were determined to submit to the instructions (sic) of their authority, which will submit them to the citizens under their authority.  But they told me that they do not replace the administrative instructions (sic), they just -- that they just want to help them in order to bring back the peace for which they are looking forward in their areas."  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have now read "instructions" twice instead of "institutions".  
MR. MOSES:
I must put some glasses on, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We just note that.  
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, subject to the quite proper correction that the Judge made, do you have any comment regarding the structure of the -- or operation of the authorities in PVK?  
A.	The civilian self-defence system as sketched out in the February 1993 document "Organisation of civilian self-defence," and as formalised later in the May 25th directives of the prime minister and minister of interior stress the importance of collaboration between the administration and political parties representing the defence of the republic and democracy  -- or some phrase similar to that.  

There was a recognition that the political parties in and of themselves could be useful in doubling the effect of administrative action, and so the political parties were regularly involved by the administrators at various levels.  This was particularly important because the political parties often had the most direct channel to those young people, militia organisations, that had been created by the political parties.  But it is interesting here to see that the political leaders want to make clear that the administration is really in charge here, and that it is the responsibility of administrators to be operating this system, to which political parties bring their collaboration, but not the lead role.  Whether that is true or not, it is an interesting reflection of the dynamic at the time between those two groups of occasionally overlapping groups of leaders from the administration and from the political parties.  We see here, of course, the prefect serving as the locus, as the linchpin in those interactions between the circle of political parties' leaders and the circle of administration.  We will see him later serving a similar function as the linchpin between administration and military.  
Q.	On that note, Dr. Des Forges, perhaps if I could refer you now to Prosecution Exhibit 58.  It's under tab 12; it's another radio transcript.  It's dated on the cover page, K0267606, as being from the 19th of May 1994., And in particular, can I refer you, please, to page 3, starting on line 5.  And for French, it's page 2, second paragraph commencing on the last line.  And I am reading -- starting with the words, "The authorities should use the structures".  Are you there, Dr. Des Forges?  It's on K0267608.  

"The authorities should use the structures put at their disposal and, in case of difficulty, they should seek assistance from the gendarmerie, because we must seek its assistance.  If that turns out to be ineffective, we have at the camp an army unit which helps us to disarm tough people who are like wild animals, who kill the population and engage in looting and are fearsome outlaws.  You can seek the assistance of this unit and it will disarm these people and arrest them so that they can be punished in accordance with the law.  At the present time, as you said, in considering the reports that we have been receiving from the neighbourhoods, we are forced to acknowledge that these criminals really exist."  

Are you able to comment in respect of the structure and the role of the préfet in that structure in relation to that passage?  
A.	Before we address this passage, I wanted to remark in regard to the previous one, because I believe we didn't make it exactly clear that the passage we were discussing was an interview with Préfet Renzaho.  So that should be reflected in the record.  

Here, indeed, we see that the prefect is pointing out that the resources of the armed forces, the gendarmerie, and if necessary, the army, are available to supplement the efforts of the administrative hierarchy, if that is essential, and of the population as well, if that is essential.  That's the first point.  

The second point is his remark that he has been receiving reports from neighbourhoods -- an indication, again, of the functioning of the administrative system, which was in ordinary times very busy with reports going up and down the administrative hierarchy.  Here, obviously, somewhat less organised than in ordinary times, but still functioning.  And it is that which I wish to stress:  That just as orders are given out from the top and passed on down, so reports are made and passed back up.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
In the English version of this document, the person speaking is called "speaker". And then on page 5, suddenly the journalist says to the speaker, "Very good, Mr. Prefect".  But then follows a continuation of the exchange, and the person is suddenly identified as Prefect Renzaho. 
MR. MOSES: 
I had noted the same thing, Your Honour.  I can ask -- I think Dr. Des Forges is aware of this -- that very point that Your Honour raised.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, at the bottom of page 5, where the journalist says, "Very good, Mr. Préfet, apart from this security problem" what were the previous paragraphs or pages which were referring to journalist and speaker, what were they talking about?  Did it have anything to do with security? 
A.	Yes, although it is unexplained why the speaker is not identified in the first pages and is identified in the later ones, there is a continuity throughout in terms of both the content and the status from which the speaker is expressing himself, which would indicate that it is, in fact, the préfet who is speaking.  If you look, for example, at the bottom of page 2, that is, K0267607, the fourth line from the bottom, middle of the line:  "I am requesting the communal leaders, the secteurs and the cellule officials, to do their utmost to protect the people by arresting these criminals -- these criminals".  This, I think, is a clear indication that the speaker has the authority of préfet, because he would not otherwise be in a position to give orders to those persons being listed here, including the leaders at the level of commune. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But even assuming that this person is a prefect, there is no link to Kigali in that sequence.  Kigali is only introduced on page 5, by the journalist saying "Here in Kigali".  

Defence, is it disputed that the speaker here is the Accused?  
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, but I simply wish to inform the Trial Chamber that Mr. Renzaho was indeed endorsing those comments, and it was indeed he who had made such pronouncements at the very beginning of the interview, if that can be of any assistance to the Trial Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
THE WITNESS:
In addition, I would just point out, Your Honour, that there is a reference to the army unit -- the army unit which is there to oppose looting activities; and, to the best of my knowledge, it was in Kigali that that unit was effective.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Thank you, Dr. Des Forges.  On that point, perhaps, Dr. Des Forges, can I refer you to Prosecution Exhibit 61; it's under tab 15.  And from the -- from the schedule, it is dated the 8th of June 1994.  And I am looking at page 7 with a K number of K0377854.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that is the additional translation we received on Friday.  

MR. MOSES: 
One of them, yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MR. MOSES: 
That's correct.  And for the French, it's page 27, commencing on line 5 -- or it may commence shortly before that.
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, I think you referred just before, in the last answer, Dr. Des Forges, to the unit for fighting looters.  And three lines from the bottom of that fifth paragraph, it says, "a unit in charge of fighting looters has been put in place.  As you know, if we had not taken these measures, this city would have been completely destroyed.  Some people have been killed in the course of these operations, including soldiers, gendarmes, and civilians.  Here in the city, some people who wanted to loot shops were shot dead, but this movement has diminished.  Then three lines later, "I have requested a report on the setting up of roadblocks and on the persons charged with protecting the shops in the business district, so that in case of an accident such persons will be the ones to give explanations".  

Following on from your previous answer, Dr. Des Forges, what comments would you be able to make in relation to what steps were taken or what processes were put in place?  
A.	The problem of looting became increasingly serious in the course of events, to such an extent that a unit was in fact created by the armed forces with orders to shoot.  And, in fact, looters were shot -- or so we have been told -- and the result was that looting diminished.  So it is an example of, first of all, of cooperation again between civilian and military authorities.  Second of all, it is significant to note that the activity chosen for effective action was looting, rather than some other action, such as the killing of Tutsi.  And, third of all, once put into effect, the action had -- once implemented, the action had an effect, which was to diminish the undesirable activity of looting.  And, finally, again, the request for a report, the indication of an administrative system functioning.  
Q.	Are you aware whether -- sorry.  In your report on page 11 of the English version, and on page 14 of the French, under the heading of "Political leaders", you referred to the numbers of militia increasing when they saw the riches that could be won through looting.  Was this a nationwide phenomenon? 
A.	It was indeed, and it came to constitute a major issue for authorities, particularly in May and in June. 
Q.	What was -- or what problems were caused by looting?  And, during the course of your answer, can you comment on who was being looted?  
A.	Looting was directed against various targets; of course, first of all, Tutsi.  Tutsi who had been killed -- the property of Tutsi who had been killed was distributed, often among its killers, either through some formal mechanism or informally among themselves. The Tutsi who fled and attempted to go into hiding, their property was also looted.  We have seen, in some cases, even the administrative receipts for various Tutsi property and how it was disposed of.  This activity was -- became viewed as potentially disruptive, because the goods could form a source of dispute among the killers.  So, throughout the period, there is an effort by authorities to attempt to control the distribution of loot in such a way that this not become a cause of conflict among the participants, but also in order to assure themselves of a substantial part of the take, which was an accusation leveled against a number of senior authorities.  

In addition, looters also attacked Hutu.  And this formed a double threat to Hutu solidarity and to the carrying through of the government programme because, of course, there would still be the question of the distribution of the loot and the potential conflict as to who was to get what share.  But, in addition, by attacking Hutu, the assailants called into question that fundamental essential of Hutu solidarity, because the need to build alliances, particularly among people of different social classes and political parties and regions was, as we have said several times, an important preoccupation.  And to the extent that militia could use their weapons and their presumed authority from the government to carry out attacks on other Hutu, this constituted a real risk to the implementation of the government programme.  

Thirdly, particularly relevant for the city of Kigali, less relevant for other urban areas, but particularly for the city of Kigali, this looting or pillaging or unauthorised appropriation of goods discouraged merchants and traders from bringing needed supplies into the city.  So this becomes a theme repeatedly returned to by the prefect and others:  The need for people at roadblocks not to use those roadblocks as an opportunity to fleece people bringing beer and food into the city.  And that becomes a very important concern because there were times of food shortages, which was one of the reasons why people chose to leave the city.  And the departure of people from the city was seen as facilitating, as making it easier, for the RPF to take control of neighbourhoods that had been vacated.  
Q.	Thank you, Dr. Des Forges.  And one final reference, if I can, in respect of this issue, if I can ask you, please, to look at Prosecution Exhibit 63; it's radio transcript under tab 17.  It's also one of the new English translations.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We may have touched upon this, but from when did then people choose to leave the city?  Coming back to the third element of your answer, approximate time?  
THE WITNESS:
The largest wave of departures was during the month of May.  There had been some departures already in April, but many residents, that is to say, residents who were not afraid to move around, decided, nonetheless, to stay in the city with the hopes that the situation would improve.  But, as the combat continued, more and more were tempted to flee.  And, in fact, by early June, we see repeated efforts by the authorities to get people to come back to the city, indicating that, in fact, the displacement of population had been substantial by that time.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
I said P. 63 and tab 17.  
MR. MOSES: 
Tab 17.  Thank you, sir.  And, in the English, it's page 5, the fifth paragraph, commencing with the words in English, "Let me come back to the issue of discipline".  And, in the French, it's page 27, line 5, but I may -- I hope I am not misleading -- may not -- I am sorry for my friends, I may not have the correct French passage for that.  The passage I want -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's in French, page 7, K0368736.  
MR. MOSES: 
Correct, Your Honour.  Fourth paragraph.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, there -- and once again, if you look at the previous page, it's the Accused speaking.  He says:

"Let me come back to the issue of discipline. One must abide by the orders given by the competent authorities whether military or administrative.  But I would also wish to come back to some acts of violence I deem shameful, notably, thefts and looting."  

Why would thefts and looting be deemed notable as opposed to other forms of offending that was going on at the time?
A.	Because thefts and looting were destructive of Hutu solidarity when carried out against Hutu, or even, arguably, when carried out against Tutsi.  And here I would suggest we look also at the next line as further indication of the reasoning that I am using here:

"How can one possibly use the defence of the country as a pretext to unlawfully enter people's houses, perpetrate attacks or killings, cause disturbance, take away people's property in one's vehicle without the knowledge of the local administration, of the conseiller de secteur, of the responsable of the cellule and of the bourgmestre?"  

In other words, it's all right to do those things, as long as you have the agreement of the appropriate authorities.  You may not do them on your own under the pretext that you are defending the country.  You must not exercise that kind of initiative.  You must choose the -- you must follow the orders of the authorities and attack the targets who they have designated, not the ones whom you choose.  
Q.	If I can just refer you two paragraphs above that issue with the paragraph commencing, "The person in charge of civilian defence", which says, "The person in charge of civilian defence must cooperate with the authorities, but he should know that he is a technical adviser.  Normally, the management of the civilian defence and the administrative organs" -- sorry -- "cooperate with the military organs."  

You had referred earlier to the link, not only between the administrative structure and the political structures, but also with the military ones.  How does this comment fit in with those earlier comments you made?
A.	This passage does indeed underline the need for coordination with the military, but it goes beyond that.  And I think this is very interesting, because it's the 18th of June.  And, by that time, the situation of the war has reached a point of serious crisis.  It is generally acknowledged that the Rwandan army has been defeated, and at the same time, it is the time at which there is an expectation of French assistance.  For those reasons, it's important for the civilian self-defence system to be made operational in a more streamlined and efficient manner.  

In late May, when the system is set up, it is still under that joint authority, the two-headed authority that was proposed in February and then implemented.  And this is shown by the May 25th directive which establishes that it is the minister of interior, that is to say, the administrative authority at the top of the civilian hierarchy, and the minister of defence, who are to be ultimately responsible for this system.  But, here, whether this is the result of an official decision or of some local initiative, I am not sure.  But here, in this passage, we are told that the authority is now being handed over, essentially, to the military, perhaps as a recognition of the disastrous military situation in the city.  And if you look in the third paragraph here, for example, the prefect specifies, starting at the end of the second line:  

"I must specify that the leadership of the civilian defence is not two headed.  Civil defence is organised by soldiers." 

But that is clearly a change.  That is not the way the system has been operating.  It has been operating as an essentially civilian -- as an activity dominated by civilian authorities in conjunction with the military.  Now, this simply -- is this a change in tactics or is this perhaps simply an effort to distance oneself from a system which is clearly becoming the object of increasingly negative international attention?  I do not know.  I simply remark that this does represent a change from the way the system had been operating up until this time.  
Q.	Now, in your report, Dr. Des Forges, on page 11, and it goes on to the top of page 14, you look at the topic of double language and deception.  And I want to, if I can, summarise some of the points you make and ask some questions in respect of those -- the matters you have raised.  

You have said in the report that you refer to negative press reports which were shaping international responses following the slaughter from April 6th onwards.  And you refer to the fact that President Sindikubwabo declared a few days after he took over that troubles and killings had ended with the new government installed, and that leaders recognised the need to muster international support.  It may be an obvious question, but why did they need to muster international support?  
A.	From the start of war in 1990, Rwanda had been heavily dependent upon external assistance, initially a coalition of forces, French, Belgium and Zairian.  But after the end of November 1990, essentially, the French played a very significant role in providing training, weaponry, ammunition.  It was increasingly important after the 6th of April for the Rwandan military to be able to have continuing access to such external sources of armament and support in order to carry out the war. 
(Pages 1 to 21 by Judith Baverstock)






























1030H
THE WITNESS (continuing):
Indeed, we see after the arms embargo of May 17, which did not eliminate, but did diminish external sources of supply, which was regarded by some military, as a turning point in the war.  So, first of all, there is the need to continue international -- some international support in the military form.  In addition, there was a need for political support from countries like France, but also hoped for from Belgium and the United States, and from various African countries in order to use their influence to push the RPF into a ceasefire and the resumption of negotiations.  And, third of all, given the displacement of population and the immediate humanitarian needs, there was a continuing need for Rwanda to receive support in terms of food and medicine in order to take care of the needs of the population.  

So, on all three fronts, it was regarded as essential for Rwanda to improve its image, to restore its good name and to revive alliances -- or deepen and enlarge alliances in order to improve their international position. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Right.  Now, you -- on page 13, you refer specifically to the Accused, and you've said that he was extremely conscious about the need for a good image.  And in support of that, you refer to comments from the former prime minister, Kambanda, who is -- you've recorded as saying that the Accused had said that ministers should always present a good image of the country when talking on the radio rather than what they really saw.  Do you remember saying that? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	All right.  Now, I just want to briefly show you three comments from the Accused on the radio:  One in April, one in May and one in June, and ask you to comment on those in relation to your -- your -- those particular comments you've made regarding him.  The first, in April, is under Prosecution Exhibit 51, which is under radio transcript -- under tab 5, and the English is on page 11, it's line 25.  
MR. MOSES:
Your Honours, it's a -- the whole page is one long paragraph.  It's approximately -- if I can say -- a little below halfway down, and it commences with the words:  "I will add that our country needs to have a good image."  And for my friends, it's on page 25 of the French and it commences on the last line and goes over the page.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, can I -- have you found the -- 
MR. MOSES:
Have Your Honours located it?  It's on K0111164.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And if I can read, "I will add that our country needs to have a good image.  During this time when the international community seems having forgotten us, I think it is not good to commit -- continue to commit unclear and inexplicable actions because those acts make our government to lose their credibility, and the government is yours because it is a government that was settled according to the rules, and it is a government settled in a way that satisfies many citizens.  

"So we ask your assistance in order not to make things difficult for them, not to give them difficulties when they are facing urgent international problems of trying to explain what is now happening in this country, and asking the international community to take care of the problem of Rwanda for peace to be recovered in the country."  

Is that -- how does that fit in with your -- the comments you make in your report? 
A.	It demonstrates the kind of concern which I have attributed to Préfet Renzaho for the international image of the country.  It also is interesting in confirming the effort of the government to try to explain what is happening.  This became a major concern for the government, not so much to change its policies at home as to try to explain them abroad.  So, here, the concern is not really making 
alterations -- not really stopping the killing of Tutsi, but making it understandable to people outside if they are aware of it, or if they can be kept unaware of it, to do what is possible to cover it up.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the time of this?  We are now in --  
MR. MOSES:
The 14th of April. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that's what appears to be the case, but are we certain about that?  I just noted that sentence, "The international community seems to have forgotten us."  Would that be a statement made already on the 14th of April?  There are a lot of missing portions in this tab 5. 
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, I believe, yes, that could certainly be said -- by the 14th of April.  The 14th was a Thursday, and the 15th was the debate in the Security Council about the total withdrawal of UNAMIR.  It was already the 11th when the Belgians had begun to announce their withdrawal of the strongest contingent of the UN peacekeeping troops.  So I think that was a clear indication and, of course, the foreign embassies had virtually all been emptied by that point.  So, I think that is -- that that -- this does, indeed, fit with the date of 14 April. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	The next document I'd ask you to look at is Prosecution Exhibit 59; it's under tab 13.  This, I believe, is only in French.  I'm looking at -- and, if I could ask you to look at page 18, which has the 
K number K0369077.  And the third paragraph commencing, cependant.  Rather than me reading that onto the record, Dr. Des Forges, are you able to summarise what that third paragraph says and how that fits into any concern the Accused has shown towards the image of the country? 
A.	Perhaps it would be useful if I just read the most significant sentences -- the most significant sentence in regard to the topic we're now discussing, and that begins at the end of the second line of this paragraph.  

"They should understand that everyone appreciates their efforts and is observing their acts and gestures, especially as at this point in time foreigners have started visiting our country.  We must respect the law", and so on.  

It's important here, I think, to put this in the context of time, as Judge Møse has asked us to do on several occasions.  The 19th of May -- on the 17th of May, there was the Security Council decision imposing the arms embargo.  The -- that day, the representative -- or, the day before I believe it was -- the representative of the Rwandan government, sent from Kigali, made a special plea to the 
Security Council attempting again to explain what was happening in Rwanda.  

The 11th of May, I believe, was the visit of the first United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. Lasso, who had just been appointed, and his first mission abroad, I believe, was to Rwanda.  In addition, Bernard Kouchner, K-O-U-C-H-N-E-R, a very significant player on the French political scene, was visiting Rwanda at about that time.  And the week after was scheduled the -- an emergency meeting in Geneva of the United Nations Human Rights Commission called specifically by Canada to examine what was happening in Rwanda.  

There had also been the visit of Iqbal Riza of the UN headquarters attempting to see what way forward for UNAMIR in Rwanda.  So, the initial period of international attention, which had lasted through, perhaps, mid-April, and then had fallen off a bit, saw a resurgence from the first -- through the third weeks of May with the return of these notable international visitors.  Kouchner had gone on the radio to call what was happening in Rwanda a genocide, which was certainly significant, seeing it was coming from a Frenchman, and all of these things weighed heavily upon the authorities and made them aware of the need to try to clean up the image of the country.  

One further point in -- in regards to the chronology of that period, the Rwandan army had sent an officer, Colonel Rwabalinda, R-W-A-B-A-L-I-N-D-A, to Paris where in a three-day mission he had conducted discussions with the head of French military assistance in an effort to be assured of renewed French support.  He sent back to Rwanda - or, brought back to Rwanda, a report in which he spelled out very clearly and explicitly:  "The French are willing to help us, only if we clean up our international image because they cannot be seen to assist a country that is carrying out a genocide."  This then led to announcements on the radio about hiding corpses, not killing people at barriers and, in other ways, trying to clean up the image of the country.  
Q.	And in respect of the same document that you are looking at, can I refer to page 22, four pages further on -- sorry --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before we move on, the French word you referred to was cependant, C-E-P-E-N-D-A-N-T.  And of the three names, Riza, R-I-Z-A.  The first name is Iqbal I-Q-B-A-L.  And now, the next page.  
MR. MOSES:
Thank you. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	It's page 22 of the same document, and it's a continuation of the speech by the Accused on the radio.  And can I refer you to the third paragraph, third line, with the sentence commencing, "Je voudrais ..."   And, can you please just summarise those next five lines which are there in that paragraph?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why don't you do exactly as you did, simply read it slowly in French into the record, please? 
MR. CANTIER:
I'm sorry, the K reference -- can I have the K reference so that I should be able to locate the page because it's more helpful to have the K numbering? 
MR. MOSES:
K0369081.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
THE WITNESS:
"I would now like to refer to another -- or delicate or thorny issue.  You heard it being said that at present the government is making efforts to sensitise people to the issue of human rights, especially because abroad we are being accused of committing killings, preventing people from moving about freely, and so on and so forth.  

"As a matter of fact, the government has already taken some measures and is asking the appropriate organs or institutions to implement those measures."

So, basically, the idea being that this is a delicate subject; that the government is beginning to talk about human rights to people, especially because abroad, "We are being accused of committing killings and keeping people from moving around freely".  I believe this is a reference, in all probability, to the upcoming Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva, because it's the basis for which Canada -- the basis to which Canada referred in -- in summoning delegates to this extraordinary emergency meeting -- was the pattern of ethnic killing in Rwanda.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
When Rwabalinda sent back his report, did he use the word genocide? 
THE WITNESS:
No, Your Honour, he did not.  He spoke of the need to clean up our image.  He talked about hiring public relations people, but he nowhere used that word, no.  Kouchner used it, I believe, the day after Rwabalinda wrote his report.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Finally, on this matter, can I refer you please to Prosecution Exhibit 63, which is under tab 17, which I understand to be the 18th of June 1994, and page 7, and the fourth paragraph.  In the French, I have the page reference, which is page 10 in the French and the third paragraph.  And -- and, if I can read:

"They have to understand that this country belongs to Rwandans.  Rwanda is under the rule of law; we cannot afford to behave like the Inyenzi because the international community is watching us.  The latter is asking us to report to it on the observance of the international conventions we have signed on the protection of populations.  I sincerely ask of you that you assist our government in its fight against the Inyenzi, not only on the military front, but also by showing the international community that we have a vision for our country."  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the last sentence.  
MR. MOSES:
I'll read that:

"As a consequence, we must observe the law, respect human life and ensure the security of other peoples' property."
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Sorry, Dr. Des Forges, once again, are you able to comment in respect of the Accused's concerns regarding the international community?  
A.	Yes, it's clear here, in these remarks, and we should point out that the remarks are addressed to the youth, meaning, the militia, basically, that the préfet is very concerned that the international community is watching, and that Rwanda has been asked to account for its behaviour now by the international community.  

The commission -- the UN Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva named a special rapporteur, who was visiting Rwanda, and whose mandate included reporting on the situation, and particularly, the question of whether or not there was genocide being carried out.  It's also again important to note as -- as I did when discussing the June 18th broadcast previously, that the French Opération Turquoise was arriving in Rwanda.  There was a hope on the part of many authorities that this would lead to renewed French assistance sufficient to stop the military advance of the RPF, and that the French had made, as a condition of that assistance, that Rwanda clean up its international image.  
Q.	Thank you.  
A.	I think it -- it also, if I could just add, it is true that by late June, some international press were travelling outside of Kigali observing the situation in Butare, for example -- or, in eastern Rwanda, but Kigali remained, nonetheless, the focus and it was a special responsibility of the préfet of Kigali to be aware of this international presence, and to do his best to assure a positive image of the country to those visiting the capital city.  
Q.	Are you aware -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
When did the special rapporteur visit Rwanda? 
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, I would have to verify the dates.  It was certainly in the month of June, but I am not positive of the exact dates. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Are you aware -- apart from the observations of journalists or of visitors to Rwanda -- that Rwandan officials were -- had -- were concerned in respect of their actions being observed by foreigners in any other way, apart from direct observation by people on the ground? 
A.	A number of authorities referred to satellite observations being a source of information for the international community.  When I first heard those references from witnesses in Rwanda, I discounted this as highly unlikely.  But, I have subsequently learnt that there was, in fact, satellite observation, and I have seen photographs from that observation indicating that on, at least, some dates, there were photographs made available to some in the international community of what was happening on the ground.  
Q.	In your -- in your report, the bottom of page 12 and the top of page 13, you refer to officials seeking to excuse the actions from a lack of capacity, or blaming the exceptional or occasional misconduct of a few badly behaved militia or soldiers.  Is that something which was an excuse used by a number of officials? 
A.	Yes, it was.  Often the official line was the killings have stopped, order has been restored, and, then, if the listener possessed factual information to show this were not the case -- this was not the case, then the official position would become, "Well, yes, there are a few unfortunate and isolated incidents; we are unable to control them because we lack the resources."  Or, another nuance to that, "These are the actions of a few misguided individuals whom we are attempting to bring under control." 
There was consistency in this kind of explanation beginning, actually, from 1990 forward, but it was a kind of explanation used frequently during the genocide.  
Q.	And on that point, can I please refer you to Prosecution Exhibit 54, which is under tab 8?  
The K reference is K0272361.  And for the French, it's page 20, in the second paragraph.  And I'm looking at the second-to-bottom line commencing, "That is why."
A.	I'm sorry, the page number?  
Q.	Page 13.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You mean, the last sentence on page 13?  
MR. MOSES:
That's correct, Your Honour.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Have you found it, Dr. Des Forges? 
A.	I have.  
Q.	All right.  If I can just read it:  "That is why I would ask you to commit yourselves fully to ensuring that the organisation and supervision of patrols is enhanced so that criminals do not take advantage to attack innocent people.  

"We have started noticing some of such criminal acts in several sectors where some youths are colluding with reckless soldiers to attack members of the population, extort money and loot houses." 

How does that fit in with the matters you have just commented on? 
A.	It is an example of that kind of explanation.  I would point out that this is not -- this is not an explanation devoid of all reality.  In other words, in situations like these, there were obviously some people who acted in an undisciplined fashion.  But at the same time, to explain the slaughter of tens of thousands of people as the acts of a few misguided youths was clearly a nonsensical effort to avoid responsibility for an organised programme run by the administration.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. MOSES:
Your Honours, is this a suitable time to take the break?  I'll look again over my notes.  I'm -- I'll do my utmost to make sure that we can finish by the lunchbreak.  I think it's -- it's possible; I'm about two-thirds of the way through, if that's of any assistance to you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's good, thank you.  

We will then have our 11 o'clock break.  Because of a meeting, we have to prolong it slightly.  We will start again at 11:35.  
The Court is adjourned.  
(Court recessed from 1100H to 1145H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
The meeting took longer than anticipated, so we are 10 minutes late, I'm sorry. 

Prosecution? 
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, on page 13 of your report you comment that throughout the genocide most authorities called periodically for quote, "restoring order", close quote, for an end to killings, looting and other misconduct.  Many such pronouncements had no noticeable impact, suggesting they may have been meant as much for foreign as for Rwandan ears.  And you then state that as the former 
prime minister, Kambanda concluded:  The orders about restoring security were weak, vague and contradictory.  And you go on there to refer to a directive that Prime Minister Kambanda issued on 
April 27, which in one moment he calls for an end to violence, looting and other acts of cruelty, but at another, he reminds the population to defend itself when attacked. 

I'm wondering if you could please turn to the first bundle of documents, and look at -- it's 
Prosecution Exhibit 28, and it's at tab 24.  And I think there should be three documents there:  One in English, French and Kinyarwanda.  Is that the document that you referred to in your report? 
A.	It is -- it is.  
Q.	And looking on the English -- page 3, the third paragraph under number 4, is that one of the paragraphs that you were referring to when you wrote your report? 
A.	It is.  
Q.	And is there anything else noteworthy in that document that you would like to bring to the Court's attention to - or, is that the primary paragraph? 
A.	I believe that's the primary paragraph.  You will see that the prime minister calls for the authorities to punish severely any person found guilty of these acts.  And yet, Kambanda himself has admitted that on the rare occasion when persons were arrested for killing Tutsi, that he personally ordered their release.  So, I think that makes clear, in real terms, what is meant here by the call to restore order.  Order means order for the Hutu; it means providing the security necessary for the Hutu.  The Tutsi fall outside the circle of order, and it is not necessary to punish people who kill them.  
Q.	Now, tell me if I'm wrong, but is it a fair assumption -- from what you have told the Trial Chamber 
earlier -- that it would have been obvious to civilian authorities that Tutsi were being targeted? 
A.	Indeed all testimony from every source, whether it's authorities, victims, onlookers, foreign visitors, the press -- everything is clear that it is Tutsi who are being targeted.  
Q.	And how soon, in your opinion after the 6th of April, would it have become abundantly apparent that Tutsi were being targeted? 
A.	If we're speaking of the city of Kigali, my own conclusion would be that that was clear from the 
7th of April.  But if one wished to contest that in any way, there would certainly be the date of the 
9th of April, when there was a massacre at the Gikondo church, where the persons gathered at the church were selected on the basis of their identity card, and where the massacre was carried out as a result of joint activity by the army, the gendarmerie, and the militia, for the purpose of selecting and killing the Tutsi civilians -- men, women and children, who had taken shelter in that church.  From that point forward, there certainly could not have been any argument about what was happening.  
Q.	How often have you seen, read or heard a report of any leader in Rwanda -- military, civilian, political, stating on radio or elsewhere simply that, "Not all Tutsi are our enemy.  Don't kill Tutsi people just because they are Tutsi"?  
A.	There were, on occasion, such remarks made, but often then immediately contradicted by other -- other statements, which showed the real intent of the speaker.  For anyone who had any question about the true meaning of the message, the reference would be then, not the words, but the actions.  And given that authorities did not arrest or punish people who were, in broad daylight, searching out, identifying and killing Tutsi, the real intent of the authorities was clear.  
Q.	Have you ever seen any such simple statement having been made by this Accused -- namely, that not all Tutsi are our enemy? 
A.	I do not recall a direct statement of that nature.  
Q.	Now you've already just referred to the issue of the lack of follow-up by authorities when offences were being committed in broad daylight.  And, also on page 13 -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you moving on to a slightly different topic?  
MR. MOSES:
It's related, but -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could I just interject something there?  

We are still at double language, and what Mr. Moses did was to ask you to refer to the directive of the 27th of April and to identify the paragraph where the message was to stop the violence, and that's what we just did.  But, if you look at the footnote and read the last sentence in that paragraph in context, I have a question.  First, you say that there is a need to stop the violence, and then after the comma, "But at another moment, he reminds the population to defend itself when attacked", and that's where we end up in footnote number 34.  

Now, we have identified the first limb of that sentence -- namely, stop the killing, but what about the second?  Does that follow from this directive or some other source? 
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, if you would refer to page 2 at that same tab, paragraphs 1 and 2, and paragraph 3, in fact, as well, you will see the prime minister calling for the organisation of security meetings, and then in paragraph 2, at all levels, including representatives of the political parties, representatives of religious denominations, representatives of the administration, of the national army -- in other words, all these groups are to be involved.  And, then, in paragraph 3, the lines at the bottom of the page:  

"Nonetheless, the population must remain watchful in order to unmask the enemy and his accomplices, and hand them over to the authorities and get the national army to assist them where they prove incapable of doing so."  

And then, he calls upon the authorities to set up roadblocks -- officially recognised roadblocks, and a system of patrols.  So, all of those would be the kinds of references which I meant.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the point then is that the double language occurs in the same document? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour, ordinarily it was the case.  
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	You make the comment on page 13 that with murderers, looters and rapists continuing their activities unhindered and with increasing levels of profit, the public pronouncements about restoring order were not -- not surprisingly, lacked all credibility.  And one of the footnotes you've referred to -- footnote 37 is a Radio Rwanda -- I'm sorry, initially, if I can ask you to look at footnote 36:  UNAMIR notes of 
Radio Rwanda broadcast, 24 April.  

I'm wondering if you could please look at Prosecution Exhibit 27, which is in the first bundle under 
tab 23.  Do you see that -- that document?  And the front page is a UNAMIR cable that's from Dalliaire to Annan.  And on the following -- and it refers to their ability to monitor news broadcasts, and on the following page, it's L0002096, in the third paragraph, it says the following: 

"The préfet of Kigali town held a meeting with the youth of the parties which form the present government.  In this meeting, he urged the youth to take weapons and defend the sovereignty of their country.  He called them to help the RGF to identify the enemy.  In the same way, he asked them to stop all the stolen vehicles in order to use them on the battlefield.  He proposed that everyone who wants to use his car for one's private affairs must apply for a circulation licence.  He encouraged the youth to arrest all the deserting soldiers, to disarm them and to kill them.  With the help of the youth, a crisis committee was created, whose job is to defend the integrity of the country."

How does that fit in with your analysis of double language in one document? 
A.	The document indicates, first of all, that the head of the administrative structure in Kigali town is meeting with the militia -- he's meeting with the Interahamwe.  Basically the phrase, "The youth of the parties which form the present government", means the Interahamwe and the militia associated with them.  And he urges them to take up weapons and defend the sovereignty of the country.  He talks about identifying the enemy.  All these are phrases which point directly to -- to the Tutsi.  And I would draw your attention also to paragraph 1 of the -- on the same page, where it -- there is a call by the ministry of defence to the population to point out any suspected RPF sympathiser, or any RPF soldier to the Rwandan government forces -- again, equating a sympathiser with a soldier in -- in pointing to the Tutsi as the enemy.  

And then, beyond that, the -- to return to paragraph 3, the préfet has encouraged the youth to arrest deserting soldiers, to disarm them and kill them.  Presumably, if this is an accurate quote, giving the militia the authority to kill soldiers, would -- one presumes -- create in their mind, an expectation that they also had the authority to kill others, whom they were to target by their activities -- namely, those who were referred to in the first part of the paragraph, and all of this under the rubric of defending the integrity of the country.  

So, these are activities which are seen as legitimate activities for young men basically recruited through political parties, dressed, armed and trained by soldiers in order to help implement the defence of the integrity of the country. 
Q.	Thank you.  Can I now, in a same vein, ask you please to look at Prosecution Exhibit 54, under tab 8.  In the English, it's page 15 -- 
A.	This is the binder of transcripts?  
Q.	I'm sorry, you're quite correct, yes.  And in the French, it's page 22, the final paragraph.  And the English K number, K0272363.  Now, it's said to be the 22nd of April that this happens.  You will see from page 14 that the speaker is Renzaho.  The top of the -- and which may assist you in putting a date to it, the -- on page 15, the second paragraph, commencing:  "15 days ago, to be precise, the RPF resumed hostilities here in the city of Kigali."  So, does that correlate to it being approximately the 22nd of April? 
A.	It does.  
Q.	Now, on that same page, if I could ask you to look down to the third paragraph, the 
second-to-bottom line, and I will read down there, and the following paragraph.  He says, "Go and get these -- those looters.  You have the means and the necessary strength as well as the support of the population.  These people who come to rape children and women in the quarters must absolutely be thrown out.  Chase them away.  Besides, in times like these, do not bother yourself with too many questions.  We are saying that you should shoot those who want to interfere with the security of the people.  Anyone with a gun should shoot; that is it." 

Now, in a similar theme to the previous quote, what -- what would you take from that quote from the Accused? 
A.	If I could take a moment to put this in context.  This appears to be a broadcast of an actual meeting -- a security meeting between the préfet and the bourgmestres, and no doubt other people, at which the préfet introduces a military officer who will be responsible for helping to implement civilian self-defence, and this on the 22nd of April.  

At the end -- towards the end of April, there was an increasing effort to regularise, formalise and -- and direct the activities of civilian self-defence, so that the violence would be channeled towards Tutsi and would not spread around to affect Hutu as well.  This is clearly a meeting in the context of that effort.  The préfet is telling his listeners that they actually have the authority, they have the means, they have the strength to do what has to be done without asking too many questions, and this involves dealing with looters, but it deals also with any who want to interfere with the security of the people - meaning, those who are said to be supporters and accomplices of the RPF, people identified by their ethnicity.  And the directive is very clear here:  Anyone with a gun should shoot.  Presumably those lacking guns, should use other weapons.  
Q.	Thank you.  The next passage I would like you to refer you to is under Prosecution Exhibit 56; it's at tabulation 10.  And for the English, it is on page 12, K0365211, and for the French, it's on page 18, the final paragraph.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The point in the previous quote was lack of cohesion; unite the forces? 
THE WITNESS:
As always, Your Honour, I think there are several points.  The first is, "You have the means and you should use them."  The second is those people who use the means against other Hutu are using them inappropriately and should be brought to order, including by shooting them.  And the third point is that the ultimate concern here is to deal with those people interfering with the security of the country.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

And now the present document, you want to address us on what, please? 
MR. MOSES:
Has Your Honour --
MR. PRESIDENT:
We found it. 
MR. MOSES:
You found it.  All right.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it the quote by Tharcisse Renzaho? 
MR. MOSES:
It is.  And in particular, looking at the -- the third paragraph in the English on that page, where he says:  

"It is therefore necessary that directives adopted in this regard are complied with.  It is for this reason that we have decided to arrest those who rape, and want to commit criminal acts so as to punish them.  For example, we punished about three people.  It means that we have started to check whether these directives are complied with."
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Once again, you had commented in your report on the lack of action in the face of what was being done throughout the country by the civilian authorities.  What would you comment in respect of this quote from the préfet, which, we understand, was around the 10th of May?  
A.	We see the préfet giving an example of the use of authority to arrest people -- or, in fact, punish people. We are not told how they were punished -- persons who have committed such criminal acts as rape and -- and looting.  It is significant, of course, that the number he refers to is three people.  There could have been many more -- obviously, for the crimes of rape and looting.  But it does indicate a willingness to use authority and resources to bring some people to account -- to hold them to account for their crimes.  

But, significant in this regard is no mention of any attempt to arrest or punish people who are singling Tutsi out to kill them, because they're Tutsi.  And the distinction is certainly not lost on his listeners and on the population as a whole.  That there are some things you do which may get you in trouble and, indeed, lead to your being arrested, but killing Tutsi is not one of them.  
Q.	Thank you.  And if you could briefly look at Prosecution Exhibit 58, under tab 12.  The English, if you could first look at page 2, and the second paragraph, commencing on line 6.  In the French, it's also page 2, the second paragraph, line 6.  It's on -- the English is K0267607.  This is the same --
MR. MOSES:
Just for Your Honours' benefit, this is the same transcript that Your Honour referred to earlier that was on page 5, that there was mention of the Accused, and Dr. Des Forges I think -- I think the Accused accepted it was him speaking. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Commencing with the word, "However".  
"However, there is no choice but to admit that some individuals who are hungry for violence have taken advantage of the activities of the population with the view to ensuring their own safety, and controlling the Inyenzi infiltrations -- have given away houses of third parties and committed acts of looting there.  
"Similarly, they harass people saying, 'So-and-so is probably an accomplice or else we have the presumption about so-and-so, causing him prejudice'.  Similar acts, if they should persist, would be very dangerous.  That is why many meetings are currently being organised, and we have decided to punish these people.  I am requesting the communal leaders, the secteurs and the cellules officials, to do their utmost to protect the people by arresting these criminals -- these criminals." 

Once again, what -- what type of offending is the préfet directing his comments towards there, 
Dr. Des Forges? 
A.	He's dealing with crimes regarding property; the allocation of houses to persons other than their owners, and the looting committed in these houses, and, I suppose, elsewhere.  It's significant that he calls into question the looting and allocation of property committed under the pretext of ensuring the safety of the population and controlling Inyenzi infiltrations.  That is to say, he does not call into question the overarching pretext itself.  That remains legitimate.  There is no question that this is the right thing to do - meaning, to search out Tutsi.  But, that kind of looting of property, which takes place under the pretext of looking for Tutsi -- namely, in the homes of Hutu, is not approved activity and could lead to destroying Hutu solidarity.  

The -- it is remarkable during the genocide, the rapidity and the extent of popular appropriation on the pretext of anti-Tutsi activities as an excuse for, simply, acts of common criminal activity:  Thieving, looting and raping.  And it is not uncommon to find instances where Hutu are identified as Tutsi in order to make it possible to loot them.  Where people, approaching barriers, who are identified as immediately wealthy have their identity cards destroyed -- if they are Hutu identity cards -- in order to kill them, pretending they were Tutsi.  And where persons who have some political status or economic status in a community are attacked by others in their community as being someone who has, for example, changed his identity or had a parent or a grandparent who changed identity in order to label that person Tutsi, and make legitimate the attack against him.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, finally on this point, if I could ask you, please, to look at Prosecution Exhibit 63, which is tab 17, on the 18th of June.  And in the English, it is on page 4.  It is somewhat difficult to read all the K numbers, I believe, it's K0375474.  And in the French, it's page 5, the third paragraph.  

And at the top of the page, Dr. Des Forges, do you see it commences -- and if we -- sorry, if we look at page 2, initially there is a speech from the préfet, Renzaho, which goes on up to the first 
two paragraphs of page 4, where he says:  
"To answer your question clearly, we ask for the support of the population and the local authorities, because it's not normal that acts of violence should be perpetrated at these roadblocks, when the administration at the level of cellule" --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes -- 
MR. MOSES:
Sorry, I'm sorry. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	"When the administration at the level of the cellule, the secteur, and the commune is in place.  If these authorities were mindful of what happened in their jurisdictions, such anomalies would be promptly corrected."  

Are you able to comment on that paragraph, Dr. Des Forges, and in particular, if you are able to focus part of your answer at least in respect of the administrative set-up as it was still existing as of that date in 18 June? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, before we do that, we are now in tab 17? 
MR. MOSES:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The binder contains the French version, and then you have the English translation in addition recently, is that so?  
MR. MOSES:
Sorry, Your Honour, I -- I have it now in my binder.  I had hoped it had made its way to yours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And these three additional translations we received on Friday, we have two 18th of June transcripts, and you are now referring us to --
MR. MOSES:
The last one and, in particular, page 4.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That was the K number which was difficult to read out, wasn't it?  
MR. MOSES:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you just read it once more for me, please?
MR. MOSES:
I believe it's K0375474.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  All right, so now we have the document, and the question and then the answer, please? 
THE WITNESS:
The préfet makes a very important statement that it's not normal -- meaning, it's not acceptable for this kind of violence to go on when the administrative system is still in place.  And says that if the authorities know what's going on, then this kind of violence would be promptly corrected.  That is, I think, a very powerful statement -- given that the administration was clearly aware of what was going on, that reports were made frequently.  Indeed, we have seen references to the préfet calling for reports.  Therefore, the administration was indeed aware of the nature of violence, and yet one part of that violence -- namely, the violence directed against Tutsi, is not stopped, is not punished and, in fact, is encouraged.  

I would draw your attention to the paragraph underneath the heading:  "Préfet Tharcisse Renzaho", on the same page, where he thanks the youth for their commendable actions carried out within the framework of their self-defence and the defence of their country.  And this is not the only instance.  
In fact, many of his public pronouncements begin with thanking the youth and the population for their activity.  It's also worth noting that he is not the only one to commend the youth of Kigali, but that the prime minister, Kambanda, himself, as well, commends both the préfet and the youth of Kigali for their energy in implementing self-defence activities.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And just to place that in context, the anomalies which would be corrected if one looks at the previous page, and in particular, the bottom of the final two or three paragraphs, are you able to tell the 
Trial Chamber what -- what was he -- what was he showing -- expressing concern about in that regard? 
A.	This is one of the places where the préfet draws attention to the use of roadblocks.  The -- the use of roadblocks to fleece passers-by, to rob and to pillage, and loot traders and merchants, and food producers who were bringing goods into the city, and he comments that this, of course, is very negative for the wellbeing of the city and for security.
(Pages 22 to 37 by Jean Baigent)











1230H 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Thank you.  I think earlier in your testimony you had referred to the effect of actions taken by the authorities, including, I believe you said, shooting people, to stop or at least reduce the level of looting in the city.  It may have been that you covered in your earlier answer, but can I ask you what that would suggest to you regarding other forms of criminal activity and the authority's desire to stop it, particularly the killing of innocent Tutsi civilians?
A.	It appears that the prefect and others, including some in the military, were willing to use lethal force to stop looting and other common criminal acts but were not willing to use such force -- although they had it at their disposal, were not willing to use such force to stop the killing of Tutsi.  
Q.	Now, in respect of your report, which comments on the use of -- of doublespeak, how does that fit in with -- with two documents I want to show you?  The first is Prosecution Exhibit 22, and it's in the other bundle of documents.  It's not a -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are now leaving the present document? 
MR. MOSES:
We are.  We are, Your Honour.  We're -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Look at, kindly, page 3, last sentence, "keeping in mind that such controls are intended mostly to prevent infiltrations."  

It's the page before the one the Prosecutor read out and before the one you drew our attention to about commanding the youth.  And then the context was the roadblocks; reference was made to the two last paragraphs, and the last one there stresses that the purpose is primarily to prevent infiltrations, which is legitimate.  
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, yes.  Of course, preventing infiltrations in and of itself is a legitimate activity, provided it is carried out in an appropriate fashion to identify persons who are, in fact, part of a combatant force.  But that phrase, "controlling infiltration" or "preventing infiltration," is the language used to cover the activity of singling out Tutsi on the basis of their identity cards or on the basis of their apparent physical appearance in order to prevent them from passing the barrier and then, in most circumstances, handing them over to be killed.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  You wanted to go to Prosecution Exhibit 22?  
MR. MOSES:
Yes, Your Honour.  It's at tab 17 of the -- 

BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Do you have that in front of you, Dr. Des Forges? 
A.	Tab 17, yes. 
Q.	It's a memo dated the 27th of January 1994, and on page 2 it's signed by General Dallaire.  Do you see that? 
A.	I do. 
Q.	Have you seen this document before?
A.	Yes, I have. 
Q.	I wanted to draw your attention to paragraph 2.  And, in particular, the first half is relevant, but second half of that paragraph, commencing, "For example, it came to my attention that the préfet of Kigali stated on the Kinyarwanda radio station the RPF is sheltering the persons in the CND who committed recent murders in Kigali.  This type of statement is inflammatory and untrue but can only be refuted by UNAMIR if we know about it in an accurate and timely manner." 

How does that comment, as reported by General Dallaire, fit in with your -- with your report on -- on doublespeak in Rwanda? 
A.	The assertion by General Dallaire is that the prefect is using the radio to inflame hostilities, to aggravate hostilities against the RPF by alleging that murderers have been housed in the CND, which is the quarters where the RPF troops have been housed.  He was citing this as an example of the use of radio by the authorities to increase ethnic tension and asking for support so that he could monitor these broadcasts and react to them in a timely fashion.  It is an early example of what General Dallaire has identified as the use of the radio to inflame tensions.  
Q.	And next, if I could ask you to look at Prosecution Exhibit 29, which is at tab 25 -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And before we do that, these murders took place when?  
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, there were several people killed in the month of January in the vicinity of the CND.  And although I am not certain, I would suppose that this is a reference to those killings, which would have taken place not long before the 27th of January 1994. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the murders took place in January, the statement on the radio was in January, and this is dated the 27th of January, so this all happened in January.  

All right. 
THE WITNESS:
Correct, Your Honour.  

BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Thank you.  Next is at Prosecution Exhibit 20 -- 29, which is at tab 25, and is an interoffice memorandum to FC, which I -- am I correct in assuming stands for "force commander"? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And it's from Major MacNeil? 
A.	That is correct.  He was identified here as CHO, or chief humanitarian officer. 
Q.	And that is dated the 28th of April, and it's a report, is it not, on a meeting between Colonel Yaache -- spelt Y-A-A-C-H-E -- and the Accused? 
A.	Actually, if I could make a correction, MacNeil is not the CHO.  He was, rather, the translator.  He has -- he is the person who authored the report, but the official covering authority for sending the report is Colonel Yaache, who is the CHO, rather than Major MacNeil, who is his translator.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have identified FC.  Now, CHO, which means?  
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, that would be chief humanitarian officer of UNAMIR. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And "MacNeil" is M-A-C, capital N-E-I-L. 

Which portion? 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	It's paragraphs 3 and 4 that I wanted to draw your attention to, Dr. Des Forges.  It's reported there that "Colonel Yaache explained to Colonel Renzaho that the ICRC had suspended operations in the camps within the Kigali area due to the fact that militias were stealing the food from the recipients.  In addition, they reported that, in the case of the sick and wounded, militias and Interahamwe were pulling patients from ambulances and killing them."  

Paragraph 4, "Colonel Renzaho replied that the ICRC was perhaps exaggerated somewhat in this report.  He indicated that he was in charge of forces within his area.  He indicated that, due to a lack of trust in UNAMIR, neighbourhood militias had formed to protect themselves from the RPF and that they were defending their neighbourhoods in concert with the overall aims of the government."  

Now, are you aware of -- through any interviews or other reports that you've seen, as to whether what the ICRC were reporting was, in fact, accurate or whether such a description of those activities are exaggerated? 
A.	I have seen a press release from the ICRC, the International Committee of the Red Cross, referring to incidents where the sick and wounded were pulled from -- from ambulances by militia.  

I would also draw your attention here not just to the description of the ICRC complaint but to the acknowledgment by Colonel Renzaho that he is in charge.  But an interesting distinction:  He is in charge of forces within his area.  But look at the sentence following:  "Neighbourhood militias had formed to protect themselves," as if this is a spontaneous and independent activity that has nothing to do with him.  

In contrast to that, I would draw your attention to -- in the binder of transcripts to the broadcast on 
May the 19th at K0267608, where he says, "This is Prefect Renzaho speaking.  In fact, by setting up the crisis committees, we entrusted them," "we" meaning the authorities.  So there is an acknowledgment here.  And, of course, going back to the 12th of April, we have looked at a transcript where the prefect calls upon people to set up barriers and to create these neighbourhood organisations.  So rather than this being something that happens because people distrust UNAMIR, it is something that has been directed by the prefect over the radio.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, at the bottom of page 13 of your report, in the English -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There are two documents dated 19th May in the transcripts binder.  Which one did you refer to now, P. 65 or P. 66, with other words, tab 12 or tab 13? 
THE WITNESS:
Tab 12, Your Honour, at page 3, the very first line. 
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now -- thank you, Dr. Des Forges.  

You contrast at the bottom of page 13 in your report the ineffectiveness of orders calling for the restoration of security to specific orders which were given to facilitate the hunting down, capturing, and killing of Tutsi which had, you say, an immediate impact.  

You also referred to Renzaho's directives for people in Kigali to take up traditional arms to defend themselves and to search houses and other places for the enemy and to cut down bushes which may hide the enemy, which you say seem to have been carried out promptly.  My question for you is, what does that contrast suggest to you? 
A.	The contrast suggests that the subordinates of the prefect and the population in general understood that orders having to do with the hunting down of Tutsi were, in fact, orders to be followed and implemented. 

Second of all, it suggests to me that the prefect and others in authority permitted and, in fact, encouraged this interpretation by taking no effective action to counter that interpretation of their orders.  
Q.	Thank you, Dr. Des Forges.  

Can I now move on to the next heading of your report.  I think the part from the brief paragraph at the end.  It's the final heading, which is "Civilian Self-Defence and Operation."  It's on page 14 of the English and page 17 of the French.  

And at the top of page 15 in the English report, you say that administrators sometimes spoke of militia and self-defence groups as if they were the same.  My question is to you, were they the same? 
A.	They were not identical in the sense that the militia were a part of, but not the sum totality of, the civilian self-defence effort.  The militia were the, for lack of a better term, cutting edge of civilian self-defence.  They were the elite.  They were those who had had the opportunity for more military training.  Their special status was often indicated by their access to firearms.  They were more likely to be armed with weapons and more likely to have more sophisticated weapons.  As opposed to simply grenades, they might have Kalashnikovs, for example, that required more training in their use.  

In addition, they were more likely to have military uniforms because it was those who had had some training in the use of firearms, who had firearms, who often were also given access to military uniforms.  I had seen photographs of barriers in the city of Kigali where it is remarkable the extent to which there are young men wearing some portion of military uniforms.  

The significance of this is very great, first of all, indicating the cooperation of the military with this effort and, second of all, underlining the impact on ordinary people in assessing the legitimacy of what the militia were doing.  The privilege of wearing a military uniform was, in ordinary circumstances, highly restricted.  Civilians could not wear military uniforms, and soldiers on leave, at least in the period before this immediate period, were not permitted to wear uniforms when they were on leave because the wearing of a uniform immediately conveyed a special authority to the person wearing it.  This, in combination with the weapons, significantly underlined that the activity of these militia in the civilian self-defence programme were officially approved activities.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sometimes concepts can be vague.  The word "militia" used now, did you use that as equivalent to "youth groups" or equivalent to "youth organisations of political parties," or simply some armed groups not linked to those two first groups? 
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, I use the term "militia" in specific reference to Interahamwe, but enlarging over time, a concept which enlarges over time to encompass organised youth of other political parties because it was they who had the opportunity of access to training arms and uniforms far more readily than ordinary members of the -- what should we say -- otherwise unorganised youth of the city.  It was in that sense that I wished to call attention to their somewhat specialised nature, semi-professional, shall we say, in the use of force.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
Dr. Des Forges, may I ask you, we know that Interahamwe were created by the political parties' leaders.  They were trained by military forces, but who really exercised control over these formations, real control? 
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, there is no simple answer because the question of control depends on the time and the place.  It varied.  And, indeed, many of the documents we have examined this morning have represented the efforts of authorities to ensure that their control be completely effective.  The indication, if we refer to the comments of Prime Minister Kambanda, suggests that towards the end of April the question of the command, the control, over Interahamwe becomes the subject of discussion at national government level, that is, in the cabinet meetings, with one part of the cabinet wishing to assert national government control and even to disband the Interahamwe and others identified with the MRND rejecting that initiative.  

So the -- the -- apparently the impetus there being that the Interahamwe were engaged in activities destructive to other political parties, namely, the MDR Power, and as a result the prime minister and others in MDR Power wanted to, if not disband them completely, at least bring them under control.  It is officially with the later period of May that the formal integration of the militia is finally accomplished, that is, the Interahamwe into the civilian self-defence system, that is, with the May 25th directive.  But it is an ongoing process varying with time and place.  Specifically in the city of Kigali, the integration of Interahamwe into civilian self-defence is -- it is probably in the city of Kigali that that happens first, and even in the early days, the very first days of the genocide, the Interahamwe become incorporated into that, quote, "civilian self-defence effort."  Elsewhere in the country, the picture was different because the MRND was far less important.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you very much. 
THE WITNESS:
You're welcome. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, I've got two more transcripts to -- to look at.  The first is Prosecution Exhibit 55.  It's tab 9.  It's only in French, and I'd like you -- if I could refer you to two short passages and ask you to compare and comment on them.  The first is on page 2, line 5.  There is one sentence there, (French spoken).  You see that sentence there? 
A.	I do. 
Q.	And compare that with on page 3, lines 1 to 9.  And the focus of my question, if I can, is -- is to ask you what persons were being chosen to be on roadblocks and who was doing the choosing.  
A.	Before I comment on that, if I may be permitted to return for a minute, because I had another thought that I would like to add to my final answer -- to my last answer concerning the integration of the militia into the civilian self-defence force.  And that is to refer to the establishment of what was called a self-defence, civilian self-defence fund in the first days of June, established by government directive.  And the directive issued on the use, the appropriate use, of those funds included the -- the -- the word "militia."  So, in other words, civilian self-defence money was to be spent for quote, unquote, refreshments for the militia, which meant certainly food, likely alcohol, perhaps even drugs, and were also to pay the costs of transport of militia to their zones of intervention, quote, unquote, that is, the places where they were to be active, and was to include the purchase of machetes.  So they're another indicator of the integration of the militia into the civilian self-defence framework. 

Now, on the -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you comment on what you were just about to do, you referred to P. 55 in tab 9.  Is that so? 
MR. MOSES:
That's correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which is only in French, and then you said page 2, second line.  
MR. MOSES:
No -- no, Your Honour, fifth line. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Fifth line. 
MR. MOSES:
I'm sorry.  It's just one sentence there. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Okay.  Now we've found it.  
THE WITNESS:
The first -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would -- would you wish to read it to us, please? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour.  

On page 2, beginning at the fifth line, "I request that the people that we selected be deployed on the barriers." 
So an acknowledgment that we are choosing the people and we are asking for them to be deployed on the barriers.  

And then at page 3, beginning at line 2, "We can find people who would be able to chain the others rapidly in order to increase their numbers.  And people must work without hesitation.  When you have been taught to do something, you can do it with assurance.  There are people who chose themselves or elected themselves in order to control the barriers, but, as a matter of fact, there is no one who can claim to love his country more than the other except for the traitors.  

"One can say that such a person is a traitor and does not love his country.  But there is also something called overzealousness, and it is because of such excessive zeal that some undisciplined people kill, and we are strongly against that." 

The reference, I believe, is to choosing people, recruiting people to learn to fire firearms, if you refer to the previous page.  So the acknowledgment that the deploying of people on the barriers and the training of people to use firearms are officially directed activities, carried out at the behest of the prefect and others, this put in contrast to those people who choose themselves to man the barriers and who may be guilty of an excess of zeal, arguing that they love their country more than others.  So people are warned against about -- excuse me, against killing blindly.  Killing is not an activity to be carried out blindly but, obviously, with discrimination. 
MR. MOSES:
Now, Your Honour, I note the time.  And it's difficult to give an accurate indication.  I'm thinking I will be perhaps 20 -- 20 minutes, maybe 25.  I don't know whether you want to take the break now and we'll come back and finish off.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll do that, and we will start again at 2:30.  And we will then continue to 3:30 and have 30 minutes' break, and from 4 we expect the video link to be established.  

The Court is adjourned.  
(Court recessed from 1302H to 1432H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  

Just a scheduling issue:  If you have approximately half an hour left, then the Defence may start its cross-examination.  

Do you have any idea, Defence, it being understood that the video link takes over from 4 and that there will be limited time today for you, whether you will finish tomorrow?  What is your estimate, please?  

I'm asking this question because there is a need to know because of another matter for Wednesday morning, or, alternatively, Wednesday afternoon or Thursday.  It's simply a question.  No pressure.  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I'm sorry, but I have to say that it is difficult for me to say with precision the amount of time that I will require.  Experience has shown that the time I take in cross-examination is very often the same amount of time that my colleague on the other side of the aisle takes.  If, therefore, tomorrow morning we have what are called normal time and one hour in the afternoon, we ought to be able to finish tomorrow afternoon, that is, by 3:30.  That being said, let me say that this is not a commitment.  It is an estimate. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Prosecution. 
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, sir. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, before the lunch break we were looking at Prosecution Exhibit 55 under tab 9.  There is one further matter I'd like you to look at, please, in respect of that exhibit.  
MR. MOSES:
It's on page 4, and it's line 22 on page 4, for Your Honours to try and locate.  It's about almost exactly halfway down the page, and there is a sentence commencing, (French spoken). 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Do you see that there, Dr. Des Forges?
A.	I do. 
Q.	I'm wondering if we could ask you to read down to about two lines from the bottom, and then I have some questions to ask you -- or, a question or two to ask you about that passage.  
A.	"I would also like to take this opportunity to remind the population to pay attention to certain things.  Contrary to what we did in Kigali, there are identity card (sic) which were issued in some communes, located in the neighbourhood of Kigali town.  This -- this card on its right -- top right-hand side has -- is indicated "Register of Citizens," and there are people who have said and understood that the holders of such cards were -- are members of the RPF.  

"To that should be added the fact that those people are not well known.  We asked them to leave the town to settle elsewhere, but there are still some people who do not have anywhere to go, and they are suspected of being Inyenzis.  
"Pending the issuance of the new cards, which has to be done, I am requesting a check to be done into how the communes came to issue the current cards.  These existing ones have to be replaced by new ones because, as you know, the RPF has issued a number of cards.  This means that they have -- they have -- they can send -- they can send spies among us, and we will take them as ordinary citizens.  

"And you know that that is how the RPF proceeds.  They act in a commune manner and in the manner of some people that you know.  I would, therefore, like to remind the population of Kigali town not to consider people who have the ID cards, as register of population, as Inkotanyi.  

"It is the case of Rubongo, R-U-B-O-N-G-O, and Bucyimbi, B-U-C-Y-I-M-B-I, which have similar cards.  You should have -- look at them carefully and let go those who do not have any problem with them.  And if there is any doubt, then they should be taken -- they should be referred to the higher authorities for further investigation so as to determine if the persons concerned have committed any wrong."  
Q.	Now, briefly, Dr. Des Forges, are you aware of what the préfet is talking about there and what -- and what is -- seems to be happening at the -- the roadblocks and any -- any other matters that you think are relevant in respect of that passage?  
A.	It appears that at least two of the communes neighbouring Kigali city have issued identity documents with certain letters written in the upper right-hand corner, which have led to the mistaken identification that the holders of these cards are members of the RPF.  So the prefect -- and here it is still the prefect who is speaking -- the prefect of Kigali cautions people to be very careful about such cases and, if there is any doubt, to bring the people in question to authorities.  

What I find remarkable about this passage is how concrete and precise it is when it has to do with necessary measures for identifying certain persons who are at risk.  To me, this is a significant contrast to those vague and generalised directives issued elsewhere, which ask for people at barriers to be careful.  

It's clear that, when the prefect wants to be concrete and precise and very careful and exact in delineating certain persons, he certainly is able to do so.  
Q.	Thank you for that.  

Now, on page 15 -- sorry.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We had problems with two sentences in what you read out.  I am certainly not saying that these two sentences are the two most important ones, but may I ask you to read again from (French spoken) and move on to the next sentence, please, just those two sentences.  

THE WITNESS:
I can understand why there is a difficulty because, in fact, I didn't quite understand what these sentences were saying.  So perhaps there are some words missing, or perhaps it's simply my French.  

In any case, to begin again with "You know that that is the manner in which the RPF proceeds.  They act in a cunning manner, which is not known, and in the way of -- or, in the manner of some people that you know.  I, therefore, want to remind the population." 

If there is a problem with those sentences -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Why -- why do we get "some people that you know" instead of "Satan"?  Isn't "Satan" there explicitly?  I'm not saying this is important, but we probably should have on record what is written.

So the second sentence again, please.  
THE WITNESS:
"They act in a cunning manner, which is not known, and in the manner of -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Well, Your Honour, I said "some people," and I really cannot see the problem there.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Isn't "Satan" "the devil"? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Certain." 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But the text is "Satan," S-A-T-A-N. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honour, I had "certain," C-E-R-T-A-I-N.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  But you did read "Satan," didn't you? 
THE WITNESS:
I did my best, yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you.  Again, this is not important, but we should have it correct.  

Thank you very much, indeed.  
MR. MOSES:
Thank you. 

BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, on page 15 of your report, in the third paragraph -- and this is the English version -- you talk of, if I could use the term, a differing strategy in Kigali from the large-scale attacks that had occurred in other parts of the country.  You said that the authorities adopted a different strategy, largely to deal with the image problem that resulted from too open and horrific killing.  And this was particularly true in Kigali, where foreign observers were concentrated. 

And you then go on to describe whereby the attacks, the slaughter of most were either at barriers or of those hiding in their houses.  

Is that a fair summary of what you've written in your report, Dr. Des Forges? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	In Kigali, therefore, would you have thought it generally to have been safer for Tutsis to have been in -- together in a large group or to stay in their houses? 
A.	In those cases where Tutsi were able to assemble in large enough numbers to attract international attention, the vast majority survived.  Those who did not succeed in reaching those places of safety did not survive.  
Q.	How would you, therefore, Dr. Des Forges, in the context of Kigali-ville, therefore, interpret orders in April, May, and June for persons to leave such large groups of refugees and to return home? 
A.	Given the pattern elsewhere in the country, which was rather to gather people into larger groups in order to facilitate their slaughter, this appears to be an exceptional case, one perhaps that is replicated as well in Butare, where concern for reports of massacres dictated the strategy of ordering Tutsi dispersed so that they could be killed without attracting the same attention.  
Q.	Thank you.  You go on to say that on its face the self-defence programme was a force of citizens to protect their homes in wartime.  And you go on to refer to the document that you have referred earlier in your testimony, namely, the 1992 document, which was circulated around -- amongst soldiers, whereby the enemy was defined.  

Very briefly, how was the enemy defined? 
A.	There has been some dispute about the exact interpretation of the words, but certainly, as generally understood and used, the definition was to equate the enemy with the Tutsi ethnic group.  This was a -- an interpretation which was widely encouraged and emphasised by propaganda from the period of 1992, late 1992 onward, and which was not contradicted by those military and civilian authorities responsible for the original definition.  
Q.	Thank you.  And you say at the bottom of page 15 and then on the top of page 16, the last page of your report, that the line between the combatant force of the RPF and Tutsi civilians was blurred, and both groups were called the enemy. 
In your opinion, Dr. Des Forges, was this blurring deliberate on the part of officials? 
A.	It was certainly deliberate on the part of some officials.  One could not say all officials because it was not a universally held idea, but certainly on the part of significant officials, significant in their standing, yes, it was a conscious blurring of the line, which was never corrected and which was -- which ought to have been predominant in the mind of any officials who established a system of civilian self-defence. 
Q.	What, in your opinion, Dr. Des Forges, would, could, or should have an official done who had wanted to draw a clear distinction of the line that you have described in order to make the distinction clear? 
A.	As a party to the Geneva Conventions, the Rwandan authority -- the Rwandan government and its officials were bound to the conventions, generally known as the laws of war, and in that context had an obligation to protect civilians and to make clear the distinction between a combatant and a noncombatant in a wartime situation.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, the final exhibit that I want you to look at is P, Prosecution Exhibit 63, which is at 
	tab 17, and the English is on page 6 at line 2 -- or, 1 and 2, and in the French that's page 8, in the first paragraph, I believe, at line -- around line 8.  

So there's those first two lines there I would like you to look at, Dr. Des Forges, and also on the same page in the fifth paragraph, the second and third sentences, which commence "Look at what happened in Kabgayi."  And in the French that's on page 9 at line 2.  

If I can read both these short passages and then ask for your comment.  And, once again, Dr. Des Forges, if you look at page 4, you will see that this is a speech of the Accused, Renzaho.  

The first one says, "Look, the Inkotanyi come, kill people, take away the Tutsi."  So that's the first one.  

And the second says, "Look at what happened in Kabgayi and here at the Saint Paul pastoral centre, where they killed and injured many others.  There they killed the inhabitants, except for their kind, whom they took away with them."  

Now, what, if anything, could be read into those comments in respect of the matter that we are looking at, namely, a blurred line between combatants and Tutsi civilians, Dr. Des Forges? 
A.	The speaker -- and it should be noted that the speaker here is Prefect Renzaho -- has identified the Inkotanyi, or the RPF, with the Tutsi, saying that this is their own kind.  These are the people whom they are taking care of and that they kill and injure others, meaning Hutu.  So it is a reference to the ethnic nature of the conflict.  

And, again, a blurring of the distinction between the combatant and the noncombatant, lumping them together on an ethnic ground.  
Q.	Thank you.  I have three concluding questions for you, Dr. Des Forges.  

The first, what would you say to an official who might say to you that this period was a time of war, things were chaotic, and I did what I could? 
A.	That was certainly the case for many officials.  And, in evaluating their conduct, it would be extremely important to take account of the resources at their command and the use to which those resources were put.  Were they, in fact, put to the effort of trying to impede and punish the killing of Tutsi, or were they put to some other use, including facilitating and assisting the killing of Tutsi.  
Q.	And what would you say -- my next question is, what would you say to someone who might say, "I can't be guilty of genocide because I had some Tutsi friends or relatives"? 
A.	Indeed, at the time of the genocide, that statement would have been true of many, many Rwandans.  Given the interwoven nature of relations between Hutu and Tutsi, it would have been rare for someone in the elite to have had no connections whatsoever, either connections of friendship or personal links, family links with Tutsi.  So that is not, in my opinion, a defining criterion for anyone.  That was true of many people and is quite apart from the question of the official conduct of the person in question.  
Q.	My last question is, what would you say to someone who said, "I can't --" who might say to you, "I can't be guilty of genocide because I managed to save a few Tutsi"? 
A.	While, of course, any effort, and particularly any successful effort, to save human lives is laudable and should be acknowledged, it must be -- such effort must be balanced against other efforts and actions taken and not taken that resulted in the opposite, that is, in the destruction of human lives.  
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Dr. Des Forges.  

I'd now ask that your report in English and French be produced as the next -- I think the registry have a copy on the end table here of the report. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The next Prosecution exhibit number, please?  
MS. BEN-SALIMO:
P -- P. 94, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
A for the English, B for the French.  

Thank you. 
(Exhibit No. P. 94A and P. 94B admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This document we just went through had a reference on page 4 -- or, rather, page 6 to what happened in Kabgayi.  That was the second quote on that page. 
THE WITNESS:
Oh, I'm sorry, Your Honour, not the report but the transcript.  

Yes, that is correct.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't think we have on record in this case whether anything happened in Kabgayi.  Can you tell us what happened in Kabgayi?  
THE WITNESS:
It is apparent to me that the reference is to killings carried out by the RPF and probably particularly not those at Kabgayi itself but of clergy, notably, several bishops and other clergy who were taken from Kabgayi and killed at a place called Byimana, B-Y-I-M-A-N-A, in early June of 1994. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And -- and the clergy belonged to which ethnic group, mostly, if it can be established?  
THE WITNESS:
I cannot say for sure about each person in question, but certainly most of them were Hutu.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Defence? 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Good afternoon, madam.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	Madam Witness, my first question is to ask you whether you are still history -- you are still a historian, now whether you still stand by the assumption of the planning of genocide.  
A.	I am convinced, perhaps I should say increasingly convinced, by the newly available documentary material of the organisation of an effort which, in the minds of some of its organisers, was meant to carry out a genocide and which, in its execution, became the mechanism for carrying out a genocide.  

I make that distinction in order to indicate that, while I see a clear plan in existence, I have no way of establishing that all persons involved in that plan had an intention of genocide and, indeed, suppose that some did not.  
Q.	So, Madam Witness, you believe that some persons may have participated in this planning of the genocide in an unintentional manner, if I understood you clearly.  
A.	Except in the sense that I would not say that those who participated without intending a genocide were, as such, participants in a genocidal plan.  Because if the ultimate characteristic for defining the crime is a conscious intention on the part of the participant, I would not make that kind of conclusion.  Rather, I would say that there were participants -- that it was possible that there were participants in the planning of the civilian self-defence programme prior to April 6th whose intention was not necessarily genocide.  Because I have no way of knowing or of proving that there was a genocidal intent on the part of each and every one of those persons.  
Q.	So, madam, up until now you've not been able to put together an organisational plan of the -- a diagram of those who planned and executed this genocide? 
A.	An oranogram (sic), an organisational chart, I think that the closest we can come to an organisational chart is the framework suggested in the February 1994 document, which assigns duties under the civilian self-defence programme that eventually become implemented in the course of the genocide.  I'm sure that you understand that an activity of this nature did not lend itself to the bureaucratic formalisation of an organisational chart, and I doubt that one would find such a chart for any genocide in history.  
Q.	I understand, madam, that this kind of document is not published in official newspapers, but here I'm referring to the researchers -- research activities that you've been able to conduct as a historian.  
A.	The significance, for me, of the February 1994 document is clear.  And, as I have indicated, it, along with the prior indication of planning within the army and other simultaneous activities, whether in propaganda, distribution of weapons, organisation and training of militia, all are significant proof of the organisation of this plan. 
Q.	At the time that the country was at war, Madam Witness? 
A.	The country was not at war in 1994, February.  In fact, from August 1993 until April the 7th, or April the 6th, arguably, it was a situation of peace.  This is not to exclude that there were preparations on both sides for resumed combat.  That is clear.  But it is not correct to say that this planning is going forward in a time of war.  
Q.	I understand that there was no war at the front at that time, but there were attacks.  There was an extremely tense situation.  
A.	As I have said, it is clear that there were preparations on both sides for renewed combat.  There were assassinations.  There were killings of Tutsi in the streets of Kigali.  But to describe that as a situation of war is not accurate.  A peace treaty had been signed and continued to be in effect, and all of the major participants continued, in public, to adhere to that treaty.  
Q.	But, madam, it is public knowledge that you've written that everybody was preparing for war.  
A.	That is exactly what I have just said.  
Q.	Madam, are you able to tell the Chamber, since in the first portion of your report you made reference to this text, what is your latest development of your view on the planning of the genocide? 
A.	The information which -- of which I have become most recently aware included the military telegram announcing a meeting of a civilian self-defence committee in June of 1993.  Prior to that the confirmation in the documents written by former Prime Minister Kambanda concerning civilian self-defence, concerning the integration of militia into the civilian self-defence programme, and remarking on the importance of the February 1994 document and how it conformed and was conformed to the May -- May 25 directives and how this same document formed the basis for discussions at a cabinet level concerning the civilian self-defence programme.  
Q.	Madam, in your report, on page 4 of the French version -- 
MR. CANTIER:
My apologies to my colleague and the Bench.  I do not have the English version before me, but the reference is easy to find.  

Mr. President, in the French version it is on page 4, and it is the chapter entitled, quote, unquote, "La guerre," "The War."  In the English version I believe that should be on page 3.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the question?  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Madam, in your report you wrote -- that is, at the end of the first paragraph, you wrote, "This war was a reflection of the events that happened between 1994 -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We are sorry, Mr. President.  We are not able to locate the sentence being read by counsel. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Can you please explain that assertion, please? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)...so what he read now was on page 4 of the English version, and the quote was, "This war formed both the larger context of events from 1990 to 1994 and the more immediate framework of the genocide itself."  

That was what you read, wasn't it, Maître? 
MR. CANTIER:
That is it, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And now the answer, please.  
THE WITNESS:
At one level, this is a simple statement of fact requiring no further explanation, it seems to me.  The assessment of events beginning in October 1990 must necessarily take account of the fact of the beginning of the war.  Whether one looks at the development of multiparty political life or other aspects of the economy during these years, certainly the war is of great importance and of particularly great importance, of course, after April the 6th.  The war and the genocide were intertwined, and that basically is what I meant to say by that sentence.  

BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Who started that war of 1990, madam? 
A.	The war began with an invasion of Rwanda by the Rwandan Patriotic Front. 
Q.	What was the aim of that war? 
A.	According to the published programme of the RPF, there were, I believe, eight objectives, the most important of which were to assure the possibility of a -- an unrestricted and unconditional return home of those Rwandans living at that point in exile and, secondly, the establishment of a more open democratic system.  
Q.	You just remind us -- reminded us of an objective stated by the RPF.  But your view as a historian on the aim or objectives of the war, what were they? 
A.	Counsel, I have not had the opportunity of conducting historical research with those persons who were making decisions for the RPF, nor have I had the opportunity to read information, documentary information exchanged among them.  

I am not a historian of the school who believes that it is possible to read history backwards and to conclude as a result of the present situation what may or may not have been the existence many years ago of the ideas of RPF leaders.  

So, in short, what I can tell you is that there is considerable speculation that the ultimate objective was to take complete power in Rwanda.  But I, myself, have not investigated that and do not have access to the information which would allow me to either substantiate or refute that assumption.  
Q.	Madam, that war, was it international in nature, in your opinion? 
A.	I assume you're asking me as a layperson, seeing that I have no legal background to allow me to make a -- a judgement on technical-legal grounds.  But, speaking as a layperson, it is clear that there were international aspects to this conflict, in that the RPF drew substantially upon assistance from Uganda, and the Rwandan government drew substantially upon assistance from France, as well as from Zaire and Belgium for a brief period of time, Zaire longer than Belgium. 
Q.	Madam, I'm only asking questions to the historian that you are, and my questions are not on legal matters.  

You said at the time the war broke out the countries involved were France, Belgium, Zaire.  Were there no other countries that had drew strategic interest in that region and who, therefore, supported the RPF? 
A.	I'm sorry, Maître.  I don't know if perhaps you missed the first part of my response.  The first part of my response referred to Uganda.  
Q.	That's correct, madam.  I forgot to mention Uganda.  But were there no other countries, regional or world powers, who had drew strategic interest in that part of the world? 
A.	In the immediate region, Tanzania had certainly an interest in attempting to limit the conflict and played a generally useful role, I believe, in attempting to bring the parties to an end of violence.  

I suppose, perhaps, your question is meant to elicit a response concerning the geo-strategic interest of the anglophone world, particularly the United States and the United Kingdom.  I'm familiar with the assertions of such an implication, but both as a result of my own observations at the time and as a result of my study of the record, I have not yet found any convincing evidence.  In fact, most of the assertions made about US implication, for example, result from a highly selective use of information, for example, citing the fact that Paul Kagame was in the United States at the time the war was launched and was receiving military training from the United States.  Indeed, he was, as a member of the Ugandan armed forces at that point.  Such an interpretation fails to take account of the number of Rwandan government army officers, far in excess of the number from the RPF, who received training from the US government.  So that kind of evidence does not convince me at all. 

In addition, if one follows the diplomatic correspondence at that time, one sees a remarkable effort, rather, on the part of the United States to cooperate with France in bringing about an end to the conflict.  

My own experience in dealing with persons involved in the US government at that time, to the best of my recollection, also confirms the impression that the sympathies of the persons with whom I spoke, although my discussions were obviously very limited, being an outsider, but that those discussions indicated rather a sympathy for the Rwandan government than a sympathy for the RPF.  

As for the United Kingdom, I think at that point their interest did not extend beyond Uganda. 
Q.	Uganda wasn't highly implicated in that conflict?  
A.	Indeed, and one might reproach a diplomat of the United Kingdom with either negligence or ignorance, but I do not believe that one can establish any active intent on their part to assist the RPF in launching this war.  At least, if there is such documentary evidence, I have never seen it presented by anyone in any context.  It is all supposition. 
Q.	Madam, what were the foreseeable effects of launching or starting those hostilities on the relations between the two ethnic groups in Rwanda? 
A.	May I ask, the foreseeable consequences, foreseeable to whom?  Are you speaking of Tutsi inside the country?  Are you speaking of RPF leaders?  Are you speaking of Rwandan government officials?  Foreseeable to whom?
Q.	Foreseeable by those who started that war and also foreseeable with respect to the relations between the two ethnic groups, namely, the Hutus and Tutsis, within Rwanda itself. 
A.	At the time these decisions were taken, I had no contact with the RPF, so I do not know what was their state of mind and their assessment of the situation.  It would be my supposition as a historian that they should have been able to foresee a deterioration, a worsening, of relations between Hutu and Tutsi as a likely consequence of launching the war. 

On the question of what were foreseen as consequences by persons inside Rwanda, with that group with whom I had contact, which admittedly was a relatively small group, but a multi-ethnic group, the consequences expected were, indeed, very serious, and on both sides, Hutu and Tutsi, there was a fear that the military activities would lead to a situation of considerable risk for Tutsi inside the country.  
Q.	Do you think that RPF leaders could overlook, or be unaware of, those consequences? 
A.	I said, Maître, that I would have expected that they should have been able to anticipate the consequences, but given that I was not in touch with them and have not subsequently had access to documentary or oral information concerning the period, I cannot say with certitude that they were aware.  But from my understanding of the past history, it should have been foreseeable to them that there would be such a consequence. 
Q.	That first war was interrupted following a military failure suffered by the RPF, then the war resumed.  Can you briefly describe the two episodes during which the war reigned in that country once more? 
A.	In brief, the opening military combat for approximately a month involved classical -- classic military warfare with set battles and organised forces.  Following the defeat of the RPF by Rwandan government forces and their allies, including particularly the French, the RPF withdrew most of its men, in any case, to Uganda and reorganized to conduct a guerilla war, which began in early 1991.  

And this guerilla aspect of the war continued to be the predominant activity until, arguably, June of 1992 when, once again, there was substantial, large-scale, organised military combat in northeastern Rwanda.  This was followed by a subsequent ceasefire, and then again in February 1993, the launching of a wide-scale military offensive, which more closely approximates classic warfare than guerilla warfare. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is now 3:30, and the technicians need half an hour in order to arrange the video link.  So we will then adjourn until 4 o'clock and start with the next witness at 4 o'clock.  

And your testimony will then continue tomorrow morning at 8:45.  Thank you very much. 

The Court is adjourned.

(Court resumed at 1630H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  I understand we have Montreal with us or -- are we in closed or open session?  
MR. MOSES:
I think it is open at this stage, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will then delete my reference to the place, place that under seal.  Video booth, please do not transmit it. 

Are you there, connection?  Can you hear us?  
MR. DIALLO:
Yes, we can hear you from Montreal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It may not be necessary.  I think I'm now revoking the order to place that under seal because it's a large country and many persons are there.  That's good.  

Good morning, Madam Witness.  Good morning, Madam Witness.  We would like to make sure that we have a good connection with you.  
MR. NYIRINKWAYA:
Yes, we can hear you clearly. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But I would really appreciate it if the witness could say "good morning" so that we have established direct contact.  

Can you hear me, madam?  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.  I can hear you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness and will be referred to as Witness ACK under these proceedings.  You have to tell the truth, and the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
(Declaration made by Witness ACK in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I see a couple of other persons around the table there.  Could you kindly place yourself on record?  Is it you, Mr. Diallo, on the left-hand side?  
MR. DIALLO:
Yes, Mr. President.  It is indeed Mr. Diallo, and I'm with Didace, representing the Prosecutor.  Unfortunately, Defence is not represented.  The lady who was to be here had a problem with flight arrangements.  We also have a Canadian official assisting us in the room here. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning to each and every one of you. 

Could we have the spelling of the Prosecution representative, please?  
MR. MOSES:
The first name is Didace, D-I-D-A-C-E, and the surname is Nyirinkwaya, spelt N-Y-I-R-I-N-K-W-A-Y-A. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Madam Witness, you have a document in front of you with your personal information.  Isn't that so?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you signed it?  
THE WITNESS:
I have signed it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This means that the information contained in that document is correct?  
THE WITNESS:
It is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will then consider this document in its signed version as the next exhibit.  

And the number will be, Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA:
P. 95. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal.  
(Exhibit No. P. 95 admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecution, open or closed?  
MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, I think we will have five minutes at the beginning in closed session and then we will go back into open session. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Very good.  We will then have five minutes closed session, and then those in the public gallery who want to follow us may wish to come back afterwards.

BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, I would ask you to remember, when answering any questions, that we are in open session, and to try and avoid mentioning the names of any persons who may be related to you who may lead to your identification. 

Thank you.
A.	Yes.
Q.	When you arrived at CELA on 9 April, were there any priests staying at CELA at that time? 
A.	There were the white fathers.
Q.	Did the --
A.	But they left on the 12th.  And I'm referring to the month of April.
Q.	Thank you.  After they had left, did you see any other priests at the CELA premises? 
A.	After their departure, Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka remained behind and he was managing the centre.
Q.	Was he staying at CELA or somewhere else? 
A.	He lived at the Sainte Famille parish, but he came to CELA centre quite often. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And Munyeshyaka is number 164. 
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, sir.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	How long did you remain staying at CELA?  
A.	I remained there up until the 22nd of April.
Q.	Did anything happen on the 22nd of April which meant that you left the centre? 
A.	It was on that day that my children and my husband were taken away.
Q.	I want to ask you a little more about the events of the 22nd of April.  At what time -- 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	At what time of day were your children and your husband taken away? 
A.	It was around 10:30, probably 11:00.  It was at that time that the Interahamwe came to the centre.  They had cleared the bush around the centre, such that one could clearly see into the centre.  There were gendarmes, as well, and the Préfet Renzaho.  They called out these children and others and took them further away.  I did not see them again.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, Witness, you say they came with Renzaho? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, can you hear me?  
THE WITNESS:
I haven't finished yet. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.  
THE WITNESS:
They were calling out people and asked us to get close to where Mr. Renzaho was standing, and then when they found my husband, he came down, together with the children, and then my husband told Renzaho -- he told him that he comes from his neighbourhood, and I came down and asked him where he has taken my children.  I asked him to take me together with my husband away and to leave our children.  And he said he was going to bring back the children later on, but they did not come back.  I'm referring to my two sons and my husband. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, can you hear me?  
THE WITNESS:
I and their cousin were asked to join the others. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, can you hear my voice?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, you have given a good overview.  The Prosecution may wish to ask some follow-up questions now.  So just wait with the following sequence, please.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	You've referred, Madam Witness, to Renzaho.  Had you ever seen Renzaho prior to the 
22nd of April 1994? 
A.	I used to see him.
Q.	Do you know whether your husband knew Renzaho, and, if so, how? 
A.	Renzaho is a native of Kibungo; my husband was also a native of Kibungo.  And we used to meet him at Mr. Rwagafilita's house when the latter invited people from -- people who were natives of Kibungo to discuss certain issues.
Q.	Madam Witness, we are going to have to ask you to spell, if you can, Rwagafilita's name onto the record.  
A.	I did not quite understand. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, do you spell Rwagafilita as follows:  R-W-A-G-A-F-I-L-I-T-A, or in some other way?  
THE WITNESS:
I think it would be best for that name to be spelt out by somebody who speaks Kinyarwanda for the President.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Your spelling was correct" says the Kinyarwanda booth. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is fine.  That is fine.  We got it.  Yes, Madam Witness, here comes the next question.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Do you recall what Renzaho was wearing? 
A.	He was wearing a military uniform.
Q.	Were your sons and your husband the only people to be taken away? 
A.	It is Renzaho who knows the place where those people were taken to.  The fact is that they did not return.
Q.	Do you know how -- approximately how many people were taken away that day? 
A.	I do not know the exact number of people taken away, but there were 20 or more.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, we are not sure that we got exactly what the witness -- or the figure that she gave. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you kindly repeat the figure, approximately, Madam Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Which name?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Asked the witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Or rather the figure of what?  Which figure are you referring to, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You were asked to give an estimate of how many persons that were taken away.  Can you kindly repeat that, please?  We didn't hear you clearly.  
THE WITNESS:
After those people were taken away on the road there were two minibuses.  One was a Nissan and -- a Nissan Urvan, but I do not know the number of people who were taken away.  However, there were many. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
More than 20 or less than 20?  

Did you hear the question, madam?  
THE WITNESS:
I did not understand or hear the question clearly.  Would you want me to repeat, Mr. President?

MR. PRESIDENT:
I will now repeat the question originally posed by the Prosecution.  And the question now is, simply, do you think there were more than 20 persons taken away or less?  What is your estimate?  
THE WITNESS:
Those people were transported in the minibuses -- the Nissan Urvan minibuses.  At that time we were told to return home; however, we did not return home.  Rather, we went to the Sainte Famille parish.  So they stayed there and we were not present when they left. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Has anyone -- 
THE WITNESS:
Instead of returning home, I went to the Sainte Famille parish. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Please hold on now, Madam Witness.  

Has anyone understood the word after Nissan?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, apparently it is U-R-V-A-N, I have been told by the Kinyarwanda booth. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much indeed.  

Please proceed.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, Witness, you told us that you had been told to go home but that you did not go home and that you rather went to Sainte Famille.  Why did you not go home? 
A.	There was no security.  There were Interahamwe militia everywhere.  Furthermore, people who were better informed advised me, for example, a young man who was called Bitega, so those people told me that it was better for us to go to Sainte Famille parish.
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's number 21 maybe.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, taking you back briefly to the CELA centre, you say that your husband spoke to Renzaho.  What exactly did he say to Renzaho? 
A.	He said, quote/unquote, "mukwetu." 
Q.	And what language is that? 
A.	It is Swahili.  What he meant was "you, from our place."  And it is at that time that I asked Renzaho the following:  "Where are you taking my children?  Why don't you take me and my husband along?"  He told me he was going to bring them back.
Q.	Now, are you able to indicate in Kinyarwandan or French what mukwetu means? 
A.	A person who comes from our place. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Shall we get the spelling?  
MR. MOSES:
Yes, I believe it is in documents, Your Honour.  It is M-U-K-W-E-T-U.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, at the point that you -- sorry.  Who was it who told you to go home? 
A.	Pardon me, Counsel?
Q.	You said that you were initially told to -- when you were at CELA to go home.  Do you recall who it was that told you that? 
A.	After they took away those they had selected, they told us to return home.
Q.	And when you say "they," who do you mean? 
A.	There was Renzaho, gendarmes, Interahamwe, militias, and it was later on that the priests returned and told -- or, said that those who were afraid of returning home could go to the Sainte Famille parish.  That young man, namely Bitega, told me that we should go to the Sainte Famille parish.
Q.	All right.  Now, at the time --
A.	He told us to go to the Sainte Famille parish because there was no security in our homes.
Q.	Now, you have said that you went to Sainte Famille parish.  

	Did you go with any members of your family?  And please don't give any names.
A.	Could you please repeat the question, Counsel?  I did not hear it clearly. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you go with any members of your family; yes or no?  No names, please.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  My daughter, my daughter's cousin. 
MR. MOSES:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	How long did you remain at Sainte Famille church? 
A.	I left CELA on the 22nd.  I left Sainte Famille on the 24th of June.
Q.	Just so I am clear, you went to Sainte Famille on the 22nd of April and you left on the 24th of June.  So you were there, am I correct, for a period of almost exactly two months? 
A.	Yes.  Yes, that's correct.
Q.	And who was -- were you -- were there other people who had taken refuge in Sainte Famille church who were there with you? 
A.	Please once more.  Could you repeat the question?  
(Pages 63 to 68 by Leslie Todd)




































1715H 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Were there other refugees staying at Sainte Famille together with you and the members of your family?  
A.	We were many at the church. 
Q.	And who was in charge at Sainte Famille church? 
A.	Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka. 
Q.	And how were you treated during the time you stayed at Sainte Famille church? 
A.	There were many Interahamwe militias who entered the church.  We were always afraid of them.  There were many people.  We were not at peace because the Interahamwe always came to insult us whenever they wanted to.  
Q.	Did the priest or anyone else at the church take any steps to prevent or stop the Interahamwe from coming in to the church?  
A.	Whenever necessary, we spoke to the priest, or father, but he did not do anything.  He always allowed the Interahamwe to come in.  
Q.	Were you able to observe what sort of relationship that the priest had with those Interahamwe?  
A.	Did you ask a question?  
Q.	I'll repeat the question; there's no problem with that.  My question was whether you were able to observe the -- whether there was any kind of relationship between the priest and the Interahamwe who were coming inside the church.  
A.	They cooperated very well.  One would even say that they were friends, and they always talked together.  But on some occasions, they would even go into the priest's office.  
Q.	Now, during the period that you were at Sainte Famille church, did any television reporters come to the church and interview any of the refugees who were there?  
A.	Canadian journalists came to the site and the priest took with him two young men and two young girls.  They talked with those journalists.  They repeated what the priest had asked them to say in the presence of the journalists.  
Q.	Do you know the names of any of the girls who were spoken to by Canadian television?  
A.	I know at least one name. 
Q.	Don't give us the -- 
A.	Should I give the name?  
Q.	Don't provide us -- don't give the name, but if you could describe what -- how you knew that person.  
A.	All I know is that I knew -- or, I know that girl very well. 
Q.	How did you know the girl very well?  Was the girl related to you in any way?  
A.	I told you that I know the girl well -- well enough.  
Q.	Was it a relative of yours?  
A.	Do you want me to give you the girl's name?  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Witness, that girl, was she a relative or a friend?  Just answer that question, please.  
THE WITNESS: 
She was a relative.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And do you know -- well, you say that the priest had told these people what to say.  What was it that the priest told these people to tell the journalists?  
A.	That they had no problem at the church, and that they did not need the protection of United Nations forces.  That is what they had to tell the journalists, even if that did not reflect the reality.  
Q.	Did your daughter have any problems with Father Wenceslas?  
A.	I noticed that she had had problems with Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka, even if she herself did not clearly tell me so.  I say this because the father hid the other people, but she did -- he did not hide my daughter.  
Q.	Is your daughter -- is your daughter still alive today, Madam Witness?  
A.	Please, could you repeat the question?  
Q.	Is your daughter still alive today?  
A.	She died. 
Q.	When did she die?  
A.	She was killed inside the church, even though she had asked the father to show her a place where she would hide.  The father did not want to do that; he hid other people but not my daughter.  
Q.	Do you remember the date that your daughter died, Madam Witness?  
A.	On the 17th of June.  It was on that date that I saw Mr. Renzaho again. 
Q.	All right.  Well, we'll come to that.  My first question, however, is:  You say that she died on the 17th of June.  Had anything happened during the previous day which -- of any particular note?  Either during the day or during the night before -- 
A.	The Inkotanyis came to look for refugees from the Saint Paul centre, but our group stayed inside the church.  The day after that operation, there was a killing of a large number of people at the Sainte Famille church.  
Q.	All right.  Well, I will ask you some questions about those killings.  Did you see Father Wenceslas that morning?  That's the morning of the 17th.  
A.	I saw him, and it was on that same occasion -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The Kinyarwanda booth says that the witness actually did not complete her answer.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you complete your answer, Madam Witness?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The Kinyarwanda booth says that the witness completed her answer.  She added the following:  That it was on that same occasion that once more she asked her daughter to talk to the priest, or father, and asked the father to provide her a place where she could hide. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And what, if any, response was your daughter given by Father Wenceslas?  
A.	The father replied her that nothing was going to happen to her.  
Q.	Did Father Wenceslas say anything to you or other refugees in your presence regarding the RPF removal of refugees from Saint Paul's?  
A.	The father said that RPF troops had taken away the Tutsis, but that the Hutus had died.  He added that all that was going to follow as a consequence would be the result of what our kinsmen did.  
Q.	How long after your daughter had spoken to Father Wenceslas was it that there were problems in the church?  
A.	Other Interahamwes arrived at about 11 o'clock.  They were shooting indiscriminately, and it is at that moment that some people told me that (By order of the Court, this name was extracted and kept under separate cover) had just been shot, or killed.  I ran to go and see what the situation was, and I noticed that (By order of the Court, this name was extracted and kept under separate cover) had been hit by a bullet and that she was bleeding profusely.  I almost lost my mind; I even tried to go out of the premises.  When I was a few metres away from the gate, I would say when I was about 30 or 25 metres away from the entrance to the church, I saw Renzaho once more.  He was standing near the water tank. 
Q.	What, if any -- was he doing anything other than standing?  Or only standing?  
A.	He was standing there surrounded by many Interahamwe.  But later on there was a whistle that was blown and the Interahamwe stopped their activities.  In any case, this was simply because they had ended their operations. 
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, I just wonder whether the name that's been mentioned can be removed and put into -- under seal, as it might identify the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we will do that.  On both occasions.  Even if there's no explicit link, if follows from the context.  

Video booth, please do not transmit that sequence.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Did the bodies of those people who had been killed remain in and around the church?  
A.	Is it to me that you are putting that question?  The bodies were placed on stretchers and hidden in the garage.  But I did not want -- I did not want my daughter's body to be taken along -- or, taken away together with the other bodies.  I told them that even if they had not granted me the favour of sparing her life, they would not refuse to give me her body.  I then buried her body in the garden of the parish.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, you've told us, I think, that was the 17th of June.  Did anything out of the ordinary happen the following day, that you recall?  
A.	Subsequently some young people were able to jump over the fence, and then they came -- they went inside the church building.  Two days later, the one -- the person called Angeline, who was an inspector of education -- and here let me add that the young people were 12 in number -- or, rather, it was the following day that Angeline Munyakazi (sic) and the priest came to the office.  And even if I don't know the content of their discussion, they nonetheless called the young men, and Munyakazi took them with her, and those young persons did not come back again.  
Q.	And you have told us that you left on around the 24th of June.  How did you leave Sainte Famille church?  How was it that you were able to leave the church?  
A.	United Nation vehicles came to the site, and they asked us to get on board and they took us to Kabuga.  
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness.  I know it is not easy doing this at a distance, and that we were also dealing with very difficult matters for you, and I want to express my appreciation for you assisting the Trial Chamber.  Thank you.  
A.	I also thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will then hear the cross-examination tomorrow.  

May I ask Mr. Diallo, can we start 8 o'clock Canadian time, or is it the preference to start 8:30 tomorrow morning?  I noticed that we opted for the last alternative this afternoon.  
MR. DIALLO: 
Mr. President, as far as we are concerned there is no problem. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, 8 o'clock tomorrow will be fine in your end; is that so?  
MR. DIALLO: 
Mr. President, just to say that the witness is requesting that we start at 8:30.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  We will do that.  So then the connection with the video link can be switched off.  Thank you very much, Madam Witness.  Do not discuss your testimony with anyone, and we will see you again tomorrow morning, your time.  Thank you.  

The Court is then adjourned to 8:45 tomorrow morning, when we will continue with Alison Des Forges's testimony.  

Would you think, Defence, that it is at all possible to finish the video link cross-examination tomorrow, or should we make preparations for continuation on Wednesday morning -- or, afternoon, this time?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
No, Mr. President, I believe we should be able to finish our cross-examination tomorrow.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's very helpful.  

If there is nothing else, we will then adjourn for the day.  Thank you.  
(Court adjourned at 1745H)
