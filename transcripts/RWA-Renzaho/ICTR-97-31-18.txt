MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  The Court is in session.  

Good morning, Madam Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You will be referred to as Witness MW in these proceedings.  You have to tell the truth, and the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
(Declaration made by Witness MW in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have a document in front of you, Madam Witness, with your signature, isn't that so?  
THE WITNESS:
That's so.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the information in this document is correct, isn't it?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it is.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
P. 83.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal. 
(Exhibit No. P. 83 admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The translators have kindly gone through the Prosecution's spelling list and that list, with the comments from the interpreters, has been forwarded to the Prosecutor.  And I see a revised version in front of us this morning.  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, Your Honour.  You will note that your -- whoever it was that you kindly asked to kindly do this job accepted our spelling of Kajagari, but I have changed it to Kajagali to suit Your Honour's request.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I have no strong feelings about that word.  So we will simply follow what is correct, so maybe there still remains an issue on that point.  But, never mind.  Thank you for your comprehension and for following this up.  
And thank you very much to the interpreters for having improved this very useful list.  So this is then updated master list number 3 dated the 5th of February.  

Are you starting in open or closed? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Open, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Please proceed.
WITNESS MW,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Madam Witness, could you tell the Court, please, whereabouts you were living in March 1994?  
A.	In March 1994 I lived at Rugenge secteur, ******************* cellule, in Nyarugenge commune. 
Q.	And with whom did you live?  
A.	I was living with my husband, my four children, and two maids, as well as a watchman. 
Q.	And after the 6th of April did you remain at home?  
A.	I remained at home, my home, until the 9th of April, because, from the morning of the 10th of April, I had to leave my home with my children, my maids, and the watchman. 
Q.	And why did you have to leave your home on the morning of the 10th of April? 
A.	We had to leave our home because we were being threatened.  There were militiamen coming from about everywhere -- from the opposite hill in Kacyiru, and we also heard via the phone that there were militiamen coming from the place called Kimisange, below Kimihurura.  We were told that those militiamen wanted to attack our cellule, ***************.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are both again speaking far too fast.  We get signals here.  So, both of you must slow down.  

Secondly, Madam Witness, it is important to have a pause between the question and the answer, and the answer and the question.  So these are two techniques we have to observe in this courtroom in order to create an environment where everyone is comfortable and can work efficiently.  

May I ask, is also your CaseView out of order, Prosecution?  English?  
MS. MELLUISH:
Yes it is, but I am not sure - 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Not so fast. 
MS. MELLUISH:
I am not sure if the problem is within the court system or my computer.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The purpose of the question is to find out whether it is only some computers or in general.  

Now, let's stop for a moment.  

Maybe we have now found a solution.  We have.  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honour, mine isn't, but it may be my technical inabilities.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please proceed.  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	What about your husband?  You didn't mention him leaving with you.  Did he stay at home or did he go elsewhere?  
A.	He stayed in our residence until the night of the 16th, because during the day of the 17th he had to flee our home, and he joined us at the Saint Paul national pastoral centre. 
Q.	And why was it that he remained at home when you and the others fled? 
A.	He stayed there for two reasons:  Reason number 1, he thought that he would not be directly threatened, because he was not a Tutsi.  Reason number 2, he wanted to make some effort at protecting our house from any possible destruction or looting.  But, in the final analysis, he had to flee because he had just heard rumours that he would be attacked, that his name was on the list of people who would be killed, given that he was a Hutu who was not pro-MRND and pro-Interahamwe; that is, he was not a supporter of the government at the time, and also he worked in a firm owned by a Tutsi.  It was a major firm.  So, for those two reasons, he was threatened. 
Q.	Now, before you left your home on the 10th of April, aside from feeling threatened, was anything unusual happening in the area around your home in your neighbourhood? 
A.	Yes.  There were to-and-fro movements.  Vehicles were moving back and forth in the road opposite our house, so there was some unusual movements, because it was not often that we saw such movements.  There were militiamen in pickup trucks with weapons, and sometimes there were soldiers passing by.  And when we saw what was going on at the opposite hill, we were afraid we would be attacked, because the overall atmosphere was not really conducive for people to stay at their homes. 
Q.	Do you know -- or did you know where those vehicles that you have talked about were going to or coming from? 
A.	From what we heard, we were told that the vehicles were going to and coming from the home of Mrs. Angeline Mukandituye who, at the time, was the schools inspector in the secteur in Nyarugenge.  So the vehicles were either going to or coming from her house, or going to or coming from the house of Odette Nyirabagenzi, a conseiller who lived within that neighbourhood also.  
Q.	********************************************************? 
A.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will delete that sentence at 9:07:00.  Both sentences will have to be deleted and placed under seal.  

Video booth, please do not transmit that.  

But the Prosecution's question was slightly different and then less risky:  What was the distance in metres, Madam Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This answer is less risky, but in an abundance of caution, we will also place that under seal.  

Video booth, please do not transmit that answer.  

All right, let's continue.  
MS. MELLUISH: 
I am grateful, Your Honour.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Do you know -- or, did you know, rather, at that time why there might have been this toing-and-froing from the house of Angeline Mukandituye?  
A.	It was common knowledge in the neighbourhood that Angeline Mukandituye was the leader or chieftain of the Interahamwe militia ***********************.  She was quite an influential person within the MRND and the militia.  
Q.	And was that something you had known before the 7th of April or only afterwards? 
A.	We had known it well before then, because with the advent of multiparty politics, each Rwandan had to choose his or her side.  Of course, there were people who did not want to join any of the camps, but it was known that Angeline was 100 per cent behind MRND.  And she even incited others, right up to the teachers under her authority, to join the MRND.  Those who did not want to join the MRND were not in her good books.  Some people, like me, were not in any political party.  I, my husband, or our family members, did not choose any political parties.  But there were many teachers who were members of the MRND party.  They even had membership cards.  Angeline was the chieftain of the MRND ******************.  Sometimes when there were rallies, she could be seen presiding over those rallies.  And she was there in broad daylight.  Everybody could see her.  
Q.	Now, when you left home on the 10th of April, where did you go to?  
A.	I left my home on the morning of the 10th of April.  When I wanted to go to the Saint Paul national pastoral centre, I found other people who had sought refuge below the Saint Paul national pastoral centre in the buildings of the JOC secondary school.  There were, amongst others, a lady of ************** who worked in that school.  She asked us where we were going to.  We told her that we wanted to pass through the fence to go to the Saint Paul.  And she said, "Come here."  I, my children, and my husband, and the girls working there had sought refuge at the JOC school.  We stayed there for two days.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is fine, Madam Witness, but you are speeding up slightly now.  Please keep a slow speed.  
THE WITNESS:
I am sorry.  I will make an effort.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Why did you leave JOC after only two days? 
A.	On April 12th, around 9:00 or 10:00 a.m., one young man came and warned us.  He was the drover responsible for the cows of the Kigali archdiocese.  There was a building -- the stables were near the dormitory of the JOC, where we were.  So we had actually familiarised ourselves with that young man because we had some foodstuff and we shared the foodstuff.  So that morning -- actually, first of all, there were certain people who had come to the woods at CELA.  CELA was the centre for the teaching of African languages.  It was a centre owned by the Missionaries of Africa.  So, in the woods -- two people fled to those woods.  The militiamen could not lay hands on them.  So they were following them, running after them, and they thought that those two people had succeeded in seeking refuge at the JOC or at the stables for the archbishop's cows.  So they wanted to attack that place.  And the young man said, "No, no one had come there."  So those two militiamen were not convinced, and they told him, "Listen, young man, you don't want to tell us the truth.  So we are going to come with other militiamen and soldiers, and then you will be compelled to tell us where those people have gone to."  So that young man became afraid for us, so he came and told us, "Listen, you have to leave immediately because militiamen and soldiers will come here soon."  It was at that time that all of us had to leave to save our lives, as well as the lives of our children.  So we forced our way into Saint Paul by passing below the fence -- under the fence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  A question like the one the Prosecution now asked you, madam, can be answered briefly or in a long way.  You decided to give a very comprehensive answer.  It's not always necessary.  Could you kindly look at the Prosecution when you are answering the questions, and then she will give you a little sign if your response is getting too detailed.  All right?  So, please watch out.

Next question, please.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	When you got to Saint Paul, what did you find there?  
A.	We found other people there; people who had sought refuge.  We also found Father Célestin, who received us, as well as some watchmen who worked at Saint Paul and who were supposed to be guarding the buildings of the Saint Paul premises. 
Q.	And after finding refuge at Saint Paul, were you safe?  
A.	Not entirely.  It is true that it was shelter, but from time to time there were militia as well as soldier-led attacks.  So it was not complete security.  It was negligible.  
Q.	Can you recall the first such attack that you witnessed? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	When did that take place? 
A.	The first attack took place on the 22nd of April.  Many militiamen came there.  They entered the dormitories where we were, but on that occasion they did not take anyone.  But they took certain things; for instance, a radio set here and there, or if someone had some money on him, they would take the money away.  But, on that day, they did not take anybody.  
Q.	Was there a time when they did take somebody?  
A.	Yes.  The attacks which I remember during which the people who were with us were taken away were actually two in number.  
Q.	Tell us about the first of those, please.  Can you recall the date of that attack? 
A.	Yes, I think it was about two days after the first attack of the 22nd, so it must have been on the 24th. 
Q.	And who on that occasion were the attackers?  
A.	The first time the attackers were militiamen of our neighbourhood; and in the afternoon there was another attack led by soldiers.  The first attack of the militia, which took place in the morning, during that attack seven people were taken away, and in the afternoon when the soldiers came there, Father Célestin tried to reason with them.  He even offered them a bull by way of ransom.  
Q.	Can we start, please, with the morning attack?  You said they were militia.  Can you remember how many militia came to Saint Paul that morning?  
A.	I cannot give you the number because there were so many of them.  Some of them entered our dormitory.  I was in dormitory 1.  Some had remained outside.  So, honestly, I cannot give you the number; there were so many of them.  In fact, there were more than 20.  Those who entered were at least 20 in number, yet there were others outside. 
Q.	And when they came into your dormitory, what did they do?  
A.	They didn't take anybody from our dormitory.  But if perhaps I can say what happened to me personally, they wanted to forcefully take us with them.  The one who appeared as the leader at that time was one responsable de cellule in our neighbourhood.  He wanted to forcefully take me, my husband, and my children, but someone intervened and said, "No, stop.  Show them that there is security, then you can come back subsequently".  In my dormitory -- actually it was a dormitory occupied mainly by women, children and a few men.  But dormitory 2 was a dormitory occupied essentially by men and young girls, and it was from that dormitory that they took seven people away, which seven people were subsequently killed near Rugenge secteur.  
Q.	Now, you mentioned a responsable de cellule.  Would you describe him as -- or her as being part of the militia or not? 
A.	Yes.  He was part of the militia. 
Q.	And what makes you say that he appeared to be the leader? 
A.	It was quite known.  They were the leaders; they didn't hide that fact.  He was there.  He had a weapon.  And even before the outbreak of the war, there had been a system of watch -- neighbourhood watch, and he was the one collecting money from the families to pay those people who were supposed to be watching the neighbourhoods.  Those people had been recruited with a specific purpose.  When the war started, those same people (unintelligible) were forced into militia.  He was the one who was their leader, he was the one collecting the money before; he was the one paying them.  And when he came there, he was carrying a weapon.  So it was easy to note that he was a leader.  
Q.	Just to clarify:  At the beginning of your answer, you said "They were the leaders," who do you mean by "they"?  
A.	Him, one Léonard Bagabo, who was the responsable de cellule.  In normal administration, he was a civilian authority.  But the civilian authority was also the one in charge of the militia.  Now, the militia was not comprised of soldiers, they were mere civilians who had been trained and enlisted to massacre undesirable people.  He was a civilian authority and, he was the one leading those civilians who had converted themselves into killers.  And when I said "They," I was referring to him, Bagabo and the other members of the cellule who were there and whom I knew in our neighbourhood.  
Q.	Now, you described the militia taking seven people from the other dormitory, other than the one you were in; how was it that you became aware of that? 
A.	When they left our dormitory, their first gesture was to try and look through -- our first gesture was to try and look through the window to see what was going on.  Our dormitory was near the stairs.  So I saw them going up, then we saw a pickup going out with people in it.  Subsequently, we were able to learn the names of the people who had been taken away.  Amongst them I remember three people. 
Q.	Did you ever find out what happened to those people that were taken away? 
A.	We were subsequently told that they had been killed in Rugenge secteur at a place called CND.  
Q.	And do you know why that place was called CND? 
A.	Honestly, I cannot tell you why it was christened that way.  But CND normally meant Conseil national de développement.  That was the national assembly.  Now, the national assembly building was being used to quarter the 600 RPF soldiers who had been authorised to come to Kigali to ensure the protection of the RPF members who were to be part of the transition government.  Now, all places where people were killed, for instance, the mass graves, such places were either called CND, to mean that that was a place where the Inyenzi, the roaches, were being lodged, or Kinihira.  Kinihira was another place where Habyarimana's government and the RPF got together towards putting in place the transition government. 
Q.	And do you recall who was it that told you that those people had been killed there? 
A.	I remember getting that information from Father Célestin, who was the one in charge of the national pastoral centre.  I also got the information from the watchmen of the national pastoral centre, who could  move about the neighbourhood.  So there were rumours abound.  I sought to know from one of the workers, and he confirmed it, and I got further confirmation from Father Célestin.
Q.	Now, we don't need to go into the names of people taken, but are you able to tell the Court, if you know, why those particular seven were selected and taken on that day?  
A.	Amongst them was a journalist who was not a government supporter.  The reason why he had sought refuge at the Saint Paul national pastoral centre was because he was threatened.  What he wrote was not well appreciated, because he always told the truth about what was going on.  In that same group was one young man who was a student in the secondary school, but who had actually distinguished himself sufficiently in the PSD party.  He was a young man aged somewhere between 18 and 20, and whenever there was an anti-government demonstration, he was amongst the first people to demonstrate conspicuously.  So he always made it known that he did not support the regime.  

Another person I remember who was killed, was one young Tutsi who was a member of the PL, that is, the liberal party, and who also had always made known his anti-Habyarimana regime feelings.  There were other Tutsi I did not know in that group.  I know those three people because we were all in the same neighbourhood. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was the journalist a Tutsi?  
THE WITNESS:
No, he was a Hutu.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was the student a Tutsi?  
THE WITNESS:
No, he was a Hutu.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This first attack, when did the attackers arrive in the morning?  
THE WITNESS: 
It was around 10 a.m.  Let me say between 10 a.m. and noon.  I am not able to give you an exact time.  It was mid-morning, towards the end of the morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And what was the total duration of the attack?  When did the attackers leave?  
THE WITNESS:
They left around 12-12:30. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you said that 20 persons came into your dormitory.  Can you give an estimate as to how many attackers there were in total?  Simply an approximation.  
THE WITNESS:
I am not able to give you an estimate.  I only saw those who came into our dormitory.  Those who went -- I didn't know the number of people who went into the other dormitory, and there were others outside as well.  So I really cannot give you a figure.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	You mentioned a second attack taking place that day.  Can you recall at what time that took place, approximately?  
A.	I believe it must have been around 1330 hours, 1400 hours, because we had not got in time -- we had not had enough time to get over the first attack.  That evening there were soldiers who came in the company of two young men, two young boys of about 15 years old, and they were helping them to carry their ammunitions.  And they were also from our neighbourhood, so that they can show them where to go to exterminate.  They came -- 
Q.	Sorry, I just want you to clarify:  Did the soldiers come at around 1:30, 2 o'clock in the afternoon or in the evening?  
A.	They came in the afternoon, around 1400 hours. 
Q.	And do you know what type of soldiers these were?  
A.	From what we were told subsequently, they were troops from the Presidential Guard coming from Mount Rebero.  
Q.	And where were you when the soldiers arrived at Saint Paul? 
A.	I was in the dormitory.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you just refer to Mount Rebero?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	And how was it that you became aware that an attack was taking place?  
A.	When they came, they immediately wanted to fire in the direction of the buildings.  Father Célestin wanted to prevent them from doing so.  He told them that, "Look, they are just ordinary citizens so let them come out".  So he came into our dormitory, called the other people who were there, that is the priests, and asked them to tell us to get out.  And when we were getting out, we thought that there were -- there was RPF shelling of our buildings.  We thought we were going to take refuge.  When they got to the staircase, at the foot of the staircase we saw the soldiers who had pointed their weapons towards the dormitory.  We came down, and they gathered us on the grass, asked us to sit down, and then they started sorting us out.  Anyone who lived in Saint Paul knows about this attack or wagiye, meaning "you are dead".  They started sorting us out or segregating us on the basis of our ethnicity as indicated in our identity card.  When it is seen that someone is a Tutsi, they said "wagiye", meaning "you are with those who were going to die".  They started segregating us. 

Finally, Father Célestin sought a way out of this situation.  He spoke to the soldiers, and then he went to call the gendarmes who were on the other side at the Sainte Famille, asked them to come and assist us -- assist, and asked -- assist him to negotiate.  His argument was that those people taking refuge there were ordinary citizens, and that they were no Inyenzi, no cockroaches, no agents of the RPF among them.  Finally, they accepted to leave with a bull as ransom, a bull which they took from the livestock of the archbishop.  And then, among us, we gathered some money -- collected some money.  We were able to put together 200 thousand francs to buy our lives.  When they got the bull, they left.  But, in the evening, they came back for money.  
Q.	Now, are you able to estimate how many soldiers there were participating in this attack?  
A.	On account of the prevailing situations and weapons trained or our buildings, there was one who even shot into a room which had refugees.  I was a bit confused.  So I am not able to give you an exact figure, but what I saw personally, I will be able to say that there were about 10 of them.  What also shocked me were these young boys of about 15 years old.  I know some of them; some of them were my students or my pupils and they come from my neighbourhood.  I saw about 20 soldiers and these children who accompanied them.  
Q.	Can you recall how long the process of sorting people out took?  
A.	I won't be able to give an accurate estimate, but it lasted more than an hour.  Even with the negotiations that took place, they were not -- because of the negotiations that took place, they were not able to finish with the sorting out.  At one point in time, when they were convinced, through the promises that were made to them, they left us alone, but at that stage there were some people who had not yet been sorted out. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the soldiers left, when?  
THE WITNESS:
It must have been around 1500 hours, 1530 hours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And no one was killed or injured during this event?  
THE WITNESS:
No, nobody was killed; nobody was hurt.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Were you one of those that were sorted, as you put it, or had they not got to you when the negotiations meant that they left? 
A.	Of course, I was one of those to be killed.  So I was in the group of those who were labelled as wagiye. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you help us with that word, Madam Witness, the spelling maybe?  And what does it mean?  
THE WITNESS:
W-A-G-I-Y-E.  Wagiye means "you are gone".  And during the genocide era in the context of genocide, it means "you are dead".  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	So after these two attacks on the 24th of April 1994, were there any others that you are aware of at Saint Paul? 
A.	There were several which did not take any anyone away.  But on the 14th of June there was a huge attack which took with it 60 young persons. 
Q.	I would like you to tell the Court about this attack.  Can we start at the beginning please.  When were you first aware that an attack was taking place that day?  
A.	The first time was in the morning between 9 and 10:00 a.m.  I had come out of my dormitory on my way to the clinic to seek some medical care for my little girl who was sick.  They had set up a clinic, and medicine was coming from -- medical supplies were coming from the International Red Cross.  There were a lot of nurses who had come to the centre.  They wanted to come to the dormitory but the two gendarmes who were at Saint Paul arrested them -- or stopped them and went to call Father Célestin.  He came and started negotiating with them.  They told -- they told him that they had a list and those on the list were to be taken away.  They showed him the list.  And from what the gendarmes told me, is that Father Célestin told them that this list is not signed, it's not official.  The gendarmes left.  
Q.	Can you clarify, please, who are "they", the people that wanted to come to the dormitory?  
A.	They are militiamen. 
Q.	And, at that stage, did you see any of them? 
A.	Yes, I knew them.  I knew some them. 
Q.	And where were they when you saw them? 
A.	When I saw them the first time, they were on the main road at the centre, opposite the all-purpose room.  That is where they had met and were waiting for the instructions of their leader. 
Q.	Do you know who their leader was? 
A.	I saw their leader, and from what I heard subsequently, it was said that his first name was Jean, that he came from the Muhima neighbourhood. 
Q.	Are you able to estimate how many militiamen you saw at that time? 
A.	There were many.  In any event, more than 50.  
Q.	Now, a gendarme told you that Father Célestin had told them that the list wasn't signed.  What happened after that, if you know?  
A.	When he told them that the list was not signed, the gendarme left with them.  And from what he told us subsequently, he went to look for a military authority to ask him what was happening.  And when they got there, and the few military authorities they found told them that, "Listen, this does not concern us".  He told the militiamen that, "If you want to fight go to the war front, there is a lot of work there, so don't continue causing havoc among the population."  The military officer did not want to sign the list.  The militiamen left and the gendarme came back.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Who said this?  
THE WITNESS:
It is the gendarme who told us this when he came back to Saint Paul. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And who was it that said, "This doesn't concern us, go to the war front"?  
THE WITNESS:
According to the gendarme, these were military authorities that he, together with the militiamen, went to see.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is the evidence clear here?  Do you want to clarify?  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	You heard all of this from a gendarme, is that right?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, when he told you this, he had returned, I understand you said, with the militiamen, is that correct?  
A.	No, he came back alone.  
Q.	Where were the militia at that time, do you know?  
A.	I don't know where he left them, but when the soldiers refused to sign the list, he came back alone.  But some time later, maybe an hour, hour and a half, I am not too sure, the militiamen came back but, on that occasion, in a very angry mood.  
Q.	Now, just to go back to when the gendarme returned, do you know which military authority he had been to?  
A.	No.  We didn't get to know exactly whom he went to see. 
Q.	And when he came back, did he have the list with him? 
A.	No. 
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, is that sufficiently clear now?

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	So when the militia came back, you said they were angry, what did they do when they arrived at Saint Paul?  
A.	When they came, the first thing they did was to enter the dormitories.  They started sorting out people, people who were there, on the basis of -- their criteria for selection was young people between 16 and 35 years.  They would take them out of the dormitories or rooms that had been converted into dormitories and gathered them on the grass in front of the building.  
Q.	And while this process was taking place, where were you?  
A.	When they came back on this second occasion, I had gone to the clinic because on the first occasion I couldn't get my daughter taken care of.  And each time they came, we had taken refuge in the dormitory.  So when they came on the second time, there as well I went into the dormitory.  
Q.	Was anyone in the dormitory with you selected in this way? 
A.	Yes:   There was my husband, who was selected, and then my brother, who was with us.  There was another man, who was further on, who was taken away.  There were girls, as well as women, who were selected and taken out of the dormitory. 
Q.	Can you tell us whether when your husband and your brother were taken you were actually present or not?  
A.	Yes, I was with them.  
Q.	And do you recall who took them from the dormitory? 
A.	The first time my husband was taken out -- was taken away by a militiaman that I did not know.  Subsequently -- and there was a few minutes between when my husband was selected and my brother was selected -- there was a lapse of a few minutes.  The first time they took my brother, there was this militiaman who looked like the leader and who had a list. 
Q.	Do you recall did he say anything when he came and took your brother? 
A.	When he came for my brother, we were sitting side by side.  My brother was seated to my left.  And when he wanted to haul him by his jacket, I tried to pull my brother.  My brother said, "No, I am not from this neighbourhood."  And I continued saying that he was not from that neighbourhood where we came from.  But the other one was saying that, "This Inyenzi, this cockroach, I know him, he is from Muhima."  I tried to negotiate or to fight with this militiaman, but he was poking the list under my nose and telling me that, "Look, can't you see that he is on my list?"  I looked at the list, and even though I was not able to read the entire content, I saw some names on that list.  But since he was in a position of authority and he was stronger than myself, he took my brother away.  
Q.	Now, can you tell us a bit more about the list that you saw?  What kind of document was this?  
A.	I could not read the entire content of that list, but from the little that I saw, it contained names, numbered names from "1".  I cannot longer recall the number.  But what struck me -- or what I really wanted to verify was to see if the list had been signed, because I had heard about the list earlier on during the first attack which was -- which failed.  So when I saw the list, I had a reflex of finding out if the list had been signed.  There was the official stamp -- the then official stamp -- and then it was written "the préfet of Kigali-ville", and there was also a signature.  
Q.	Did you remain inside the dormitory after your brother was taken away or did you go elsewhere?  
A.	I remained in the same dormitory until the following day. 
Q.	Do you know what happened to those, including your brother, who were taken outside the dormitory? 
A.	We knew fully well -- or we got to know subsequently, that they were killed at the same place of Rugenge secteur called CND.  When they were taken away, we knew what was going to happen.  We knew they were going to be killed, and this was confirmed subsequently.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was it your understanding that your brother was picked because he was on the list or because he was known by the person who said "I know this Inyenzi", irrespective of the list?  
THE WITNESS:
In fact, the list was a laissez-passer to enable them into the centre.  But what I heard from the gendarme was that there were some people who were actually on the list and some were not.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You do not really know whether your brother was, in fact, on the list?  
THE WITNESS:
No.  But what I am sure of is that he was known to this militia leader who took him away.  He knew him very well.  He comes from the neighbourhood of my parents. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And why was the form of this list or the model used a laissez-passer?  
THE WITNESS:
In fact, the longer the war lasted, the more these killings were criticised.  And Father Célestin, all along, tried to negotiate and to call on the civilian authorities to help him ensure the security of the people under his care.  So the militiamen, if they brought a list, also indicated that even the civilian authorities that he called upon were in agreement.  So it was a laissez-passer to enable them to enter the dormitories so that Father Célestin would not resist the entry of the militiamen, even if -- even though his opposition to them did not yield any fruit.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	After he was taken from your dormitory, did you ever see your brother again?  
A.	Never again.  
Q.	What about your husband?  You said that he had been taken also.  Did you see him again? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And when did you see him again? 
A.	I saw him a few minutes before the others were taken away.  So he came back to our dormitory.  
Q.	And can you explain how it was that he was able to come back to you?  Briefly.  
A.	He did not do anything to come back.  When they took my brother away, my mother, who was with us, was so upset she in fact became hysterical and she started insulting the militia.  So she went out and was able to make out certain militia, and she started talking to them.  One of the militia entered our dormitory and selected two girls.  When he went out with them, they arrived downstairs.  Some of the militia were hitting at my mother with the butts of their guns, and on account of her hysterical status she could not really feel anything.  The head of the militia, who had the list, saw the girls and my mother, whom the militia wanted to take away, and he said, "No, this lady and those girls are not on my list.  We will come back with a list which will bear their names.  So let them be for the time being."  So the militia who had taken those two girls became angry, and he said, "This time around, I know that they had been to Kinihira, and you are refusing, and if that is the situation, then I will choose from any of the people you are taking and will send them back."  

So he was looking at the people who had been sorted.  And my husband was standing a bit by the side.  The militia looked at him and he said, "You, stand up".  Since his head had been lowered, he did not even know that he was the one being talked to.  And then the militia said, "You with the striped shirt", so he raised his head and realised that he was one the militia was talking to.  He stood up, and the militia left him there, and he left.  The gendarme who was standing by the side with another militia called him and asked him to show his identity card, which he did, and afterwards they told him, "Go back to the dormitory."  So he returned.  And a few minutes later the others were taken away and killed.  
Q.	Do you know how they were taken from Saint Paul? 
A.	From what my mother told me, first of all, they took off their shoes, then they tied them one to the other with their shirts, then they went down through the stairs and passed through the second entrance, which was at the rear of the Saint Paul national pastoral centre.  And that was a route they took, right up to the Rugenge secteur, where they were killed.  
Q.	And do you know how many people were actually taken on that day?  
A.	Subsequently, we tried to count the exact number of people, and we realised that between 56 and 60 people had been taken away.  Some of them we didn't know their names, but the names which we knew were about 50 to 54.  
Q.	Now, you mentioned the list that you saw had the stamp of the préfet of Kigali-ville.  Do you know who that was at the time? 
A.	The Kigali-ville préfet was Tharcisse Renzaho.  What I noticed was the mention, "the préfet of Kigali-ville" followed by the name and then the official stamp.  I was not able to decipher what was in the stamp, but I saw the official seal with the seal of the republic, but the words "Préfet of Kigali-ville" and the name below, I saw those.  
Q.	At that time, did you know the préfet of Kigali-ville? 
A.	Oh, yes.  Of course, I knew him.  He was often on TV.  Personally, as a state employee, I had seen him on quite a few occasions. 
Q.	When you were at Saint Paul centre, did you ever see him? 
A.	I personally saw him on the 16th of June; that is, two days after the attack against us.  He came to the Saint Paul in the morning.  I am unable to give the exact time, but it was between 9:00 and 11 a.m.  
Q.	And did he come alone or with others? 
A.	He came with the conseiller of our secteur, Odette Nyirabagenzi, many militia, as well as UNAMIR soldiers. 
Q.	When you say "militia", do you mean Interahamwe or something else? 
A.	Interahamwe.  
Q.	And do you know why Renzaho came to Saint Paul with Interahamwe and the conseiller and UNAMIR soldiers? 
A.	I cannot say why he was with militia, but his arrival there with the conseiller and the UNAMIR soldiers was to discuss with Father Célestin and those of us who had taken refuge at Saint Paul about our evacuation by UNAMIR. 
Q.	Did Renzaho say anything when he was at Saint Paul that you are aware of?  
A.	Yes, he was the one who chaired the meeting -- the discussion which took place there. 
Q.	And did you hear him say anything yourself? 
A.	No because when they came there, I was in a dormitory which was perpendicular to the multipurpose hall, and amongst the people accompanying him were many militia of my neighbourhood who knew me.  There was also Odette, who knew me very well.  So I chose not to be a member of the people who had gathered outside.  But I followed the scene of what was going on through the window.  I climbed on a table and I could see through the window.  I saw him speaking.  I could hear voices without actually making out what he was saying, but I could see him. 
Q.	Do you -- you said you couldn't hear exactly what was being said.  Did you subsequently learn of the nature of the discussions?  
A.	Yes.  At the end of the meeting, the first thing I did was to ask my comrades of misfortune to tell me exactly what had happened and what had been said.  
Q.	And what did you learn from them?  
A.	I learnt that the préfet was talking to them about our evacuation which would be conducted after all the people who had taken refuge at the Sainte Famille would have been evacuated.  So he said we would be evacuated second.  But we were requesting to be the first to be evacuated.  Now, if you allow me, let me give a brief description. You see, those two centres were accommodating refugees with different status.  At the Saint Paul national pastoral centre, it was known that the Hutu or Tutsi who had sought refuge there were people who were fleeing from the militia, so they were directly threatened.  But at the Sainte Famille parish were two categories of people; some of them had fled RPF combat zones, and others had fled the militia.  So there was that mix, and it was not easy to sort them, whereas we had been selected to be killed.  So when he said that we would be evacuated after the other people, there was some sort of panic.  So my comrades insisted that we be the first to be evacuated, and at one stretch.  So Renzaho's response, he did not even allow UNAMIR to state whether or not it was achievable.  He said that, "Even God cannot do so.  You will be evacuated after the refugees at the Sainte Famille, and it would be in several stretches".  
Q.	And what, in fact, happened to those, including yourself, at Saint Paul after that?  Were you evacuated or not?  
A.	We were evacuated.  But our evacuation was not conducted by the government in place, nor was it conducted by the UNAMIR.  During the night of the 16th to the 17th of June, we were evacuated by the RPF troops who came to Saint Paul at night.  In fact, they even went to the Sainte Famille, but they did not succeed in the evacuation drive at the Saint Famille.  So, at night, they led us away on foot up until Kabuye, where we spent three days, and subsequently we went to Kabuga, which was in RPF-controlled territory. 
(Pages 1 to 17 by Judith Baverstock)

























1015H 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	During that evacuation, do you recall any fighting taking place between the RPF soldiers who rescued you, and government forces, or militia?  Interahamwe militia?  
A.	We could hear a lot of explosions and gunfire even while we were at the centre.  We could hear a lot of explosions, detonations.  But we could not know exactly whether they were just deterrent shots or actually combat shots.  Subsequently, we heard that RPF troops had taken up positions in strategic places and were firing deterrent shots to prevent the government army from intervening.  Even at the Saint Paul, there were weapons pointing at directions where we thought attacks would come from.  Personally, I did not see any person killed, apart from the people who were with us.  Because when we arrived at the Kacyiru hill opposite us, they were hit by bullets, or grenades fired by the militia, or the government troops who were behind us.  From what we learned, the RPF had set up an evacuation corridor.  Because in order to come and conduct the evacuation, they had gone to Kabuga where there was a refugee camp, people who had come from the Sainte Famille.  And amongst those people were young persons who were very familiar with that area.  So those were the young people who guided the RPF troops to come and evacuate us.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Your evacuation from Saint Paul, did it take place on the 16th of June, or later?  
THE WITNESS:
It took place on the night of the 16th to the 17th, so it was around 1, 2, 3 a.m.  I cannot be more specific.  But it was during the night of the 16th to the 17th of June.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Just to clarify, you said that you didn't see anybody killed apart from the people who were with you.  Do you mean by that refugees, or do you mean soldiers, rescuers?  Who are you talking about who were killed?  
A.	There were refugees who were killed.  I know some of them.  About 20 of them were hit by bullets.  But there was also one RPF soldier who was also hit and who died during our evacuation.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, just to take you back to when you saw the préfet on the 16th of June, you said he was accompanied by the conseiller and militia.  When you saw that, did it strike you as usual, or unusual, to see an administrative official to -- accompanied by Interahamwe? 
A.	It was quite normal at the time.  Because the civilian authorities were either militia or were working hand in hand with the militia.  The militia comprised groups which had been incorporated for a particular purpose.  And for civilian authorities to be accompanied by militia was quite normal.  They, by themselves, constituted an army. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you.  I have no further questions for you.  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Witness, this second occasion when you referred to a list.  I understand that you yourself saw numbered names.  That is true, isn't it?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, but I was not able to read to know that this person's name was on the list.  But I saw a numbered list. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you yourself see a stamp?
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you yourself see a name of any official authority?  
THE WITNESS:
I saw the wording, "The préfet of Kigali-ville", and the name I saw "Re", then the rest was covered by the stamp.  But the wording, "The préfet of Kigali-ville", stood out clearly. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the "Re" was the beginning of which word, read in context?
THE WITNESS:
It was the name of the préfet of Kigali-ville, Tharcisse Renzaho. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you yourself see any signature?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  There was a signature in the stamp. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Your husband was the man in the striped shirt, is that so?  
THE WITNESS:
That's right. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Why did the militiamen address him?
THE WITNESS:
That militia who talked to him, and who unconsciously saved his life, was furious because he had been refused the possibility of taking the two girls away.  When he said that they, the militia, would come back with a list of women, he became furious.  And he told them that "If that is the case, then I'm going to take who I want".  That is why, by some stroke of luck, his eyes fell on my husband.  I can't really say what the criterion for his choice was, but my husband was slightly away from the others.  So fortunately for him, the militia's eyes fell on that man, on my husband.  And that particular militia wanted to revenge because the other militia had prevented him from taking the two girls away.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So he wanted to take away your husband, but then the identity card was produced.  Is that the sequence?  Showing them that your husband was a Hutu?  I'm trying to find out why the chain of events which started with an act of revenge, ended up with your husband being exempted from the process.  
THE WITNESS:
The person who took him back to the dormitory was not the one who had taken him out initially.  There were two different people.  There was one person who took him out of the dormitory.  That person placed him in the group with the others, then he left.  Then there was this second person who had taken those girls, and he wanted to lead the girls away.  Now, when he went down, the militia leader told him, "We are not taking those girls with us.  They are not on my list.  Those girls and the lady will remain here, and we will come back with a list where their names will be".  So that second militia who had taken those girls down became furious.  So he said, "You don't want me to take those girls.  If that's the case, then I will take back to the dormitory whoever I want".  And that is how, by some stroke of luck, his eyes fell on my husband, who was slightly away from the others.  He said, "You, stand up".  So he stood up.  But the person who asked him to stand up left him there and went away.  So my husband stood up there, foolishly.  And subsequently a third militia, who was standing by the side with the gendarme, told him, "You, come here".  So he went towards the two other people.  They asked him to show his identity card, which he did, and they realised that on his identity card was the mention Hutu.  So they told him, "You go back to the dormitory".
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much, Madam Witness.  

Defence, please.  
MR. CANTIER:
Good morning, Witness.
THE WITNESS:	
Good morning. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, to start the cross, I have certain questions which concern the witness's close proximity, so perhaps we should think about a closed session.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
About five to ten minutes?  Is that a good estimate?  
MR. CANTIER: 
That's right.  Five minutes would be enough.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So if those observing us now could leave us for five minutes, and then you are welcome back soon.  We will move into closed session.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 22 to 25] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 18 to 21 by Vicki Eastvold)


































MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness MW, we are now in open session, and your cross-examination continues.   
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Yes, Witness.  Let me come back to the issue of the identity of these gendarmes who were present.  And you said that you cannot give the name of one of those gendarmes, more specifically the one who was with you on the 14th of June.
A.	No.  I'm not able to give names. 
Q.	This gendarme, did he have a chief, a boss? 
A.	The one who appeared to be the leader is the one who took the militiamen to a place that I do not know, and who came back to say that the authorities he met did not want to sign the lists.  He is the one who appeared to be the leader. 
Q.	And you're not able to give his name?  
A.	No.  Not even a first name, no.  Because to know his name, I had to be in direct contact with him.  There was some contact, but they spoke only to Father Célestin who was in charge of the centre, or with workers of the Saint Paul centre who used to accompany him in a vehicle to fetch water.  I have no interest, nor any authority, to ask him, "Who are you?"  We knew that they were gendarmes, but I'm not able to give their names.  It was not my duty at the time.  
Q.	Witness, were there soldiers at the site?  
A.	Maybe around the place, but not within the centre. 
Q.	Witness, are you able to distinguish between soldiers and gendarmes from the uniform at the time? 
A.	Yes.  The uniform was different, particularly with regard to the -- the gendarmes were wearing red berets.  Even the epaulette on their shoulder were red, whereas the soldiers were wearing black berets, or berets with spots with the insignia of the Republic.  I do not know if the insignia was different, but I clearly recall -- I'm not able to explain exactly -- but on the beret of the soldiers, there was an insignia.  And on the beret of the gendarmes, there was another insignia.  
Q.	Witness, I'm asking you this question because a while ago you explained that during the 14th June attack, the gendarme who went with the militia to see the soldiers -- to see the soldiers -- that is why I'm asking you if there were soldiers at the site.  And you are saying no.  
A.	Well, let me be clear.  Not at the site, Saint Paul site, but around, depending on the position they wanted to take, there were soldiers.  I mean, the town itself, because the Saint Paul centre was within Kigali town close to the Sainte Famille church.  So in the town, or on specific positions, there were soldiers.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you see soldiers yourself on the 14th of June within the area of Saint Paul?  
THE WITNESS:
No. 

BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, in one of your testimonies, statements, taken by the investigators of the ICTR -- I'm referring to page 3.  In this statement of 31st May 2000, reference K0052707, paragraph -- page 3, paragraph -- the paragraph referring to Angeline, school inspector, and making reference to the discussion that, Witness, you had with Father Hakizimana.  You said in that statement, "Before he was able to say the reason for his call, Angeline told him that he should not in future call the authorities if he wanted to prevent the Interahamwe from acting, but that he should refer to her".  Do you recall this conversation? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What lesson did you draw from this, Madam Witness? 
A.	Let me start by saying, what happened before Father Célestin was able to tell me this, or to understand why the conversation took place -- I'm sorry, I'm not able to give the number -- 
Q.	We're in public session, Madam Witness.
A.	-- but there was a radio announcement calling on civil servants to go to Gitarama -- I cannot recall any longer -- to collect their April salary -- no -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
Corrects the witness.
THE WITNESS:
It was March salary.  Now, I and my colleagues, office colleagues, asked me to ask Father Célestin if it was possible to give him an authorisation for him to go to Gitarama and collect our salaries for us.  I spoke to Father Célestin about it, and he told me that it was dangerous.  "They would get to know that you are here".  I told him, "Listen.  Try.  Try.  If you observe that the situation -- it's getting complex, you just leave it".  So he called Angeline.  When he called her the first time she was not there, but when she came back they told her about the call.  Angeline -- and I no longer recall if it was Father Célestin who called, or if it was Angeline who called.  I cannot recall that any more.  But when he heard her speak -- if the Kinyarwanda booth can interpret exactly what I'm going to say, tell me if that is possible.  

So Angeline told him, "You, a reverend father, who is appearing difficult and angry, if you want a protection, whatever the nature, do not -- do not call on the authorities, be they soldiers, or otherwise.  You should refer to me".  

Now, when Father Célestin heard this attack, he no longer said what he wanted to say.  So, finally, the call was stopped and he told his colleagues that, "You should no longer think about this money", and told us what Angeline told him.  So we put a cross on this money and never spoke about it again. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You have now, Mâitre Cantier, used a portion of a previous witness statement, and you gave us the K number and the date.  The date we heard was the 31st of May 2000.  Is that the same statement as the one signed by the witness on the 12th of June 2000?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  There's always some difficulty getting -- running through these documents.  The passage that I was referring to was in the statement of 8th of May 1998, and the reference I gave you K0052707 is the right reference.  Date of interview, 8th May 1998.  And the reference in French, K0052707, paragraph 3. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Very good.  With this correction, everything fits nicely together.  Thank you.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, in the document that you saw on the 6th of June, you said that you saw the préfecture stamp.  
A.	Let me make a correction.  I saw the official stamp.  I was not able to read the words that were there.  But I saw under the stamp, "Préfet, Kigali-ville", with "Re".  And then the rest disappeared under the stamp.  
Q.	And you are saying that you are not able to see the signature very well because it was mixed up with the stamp.  I believe I understand you clearly.  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	You talked about a conseiller of your secteur.  Do you know the bourgmestre of the commune in which you lived? 
A.	I recall that he was called Jean Baptiste Bizimana. 
Q.	During these events that you described, did you see him at that location? 
A.	I did not see him with my own eyes.  But from what was reported to me, he allegedly came to the Saint Paul centre on the 24th of April.  The seven persons who were abducted, it was he himself who told Father Célestin that, "Don't worry, nothing will be done to them.  I guarantee their security".  He was there.  And among those people who were taken away, he was there.  Finally, he did not give any security, because they were killed.  
Q.	Witness, a while ago, you recounted what Mr. Renzaho might have said on the 16th June 1994.  Do you confirm that you yourself did not hear this conversation? 
A.	But I could see him about five or six metres away.  I could see him through the window.  I could hear sounds, but I could not understand or distinguish the sentences. 
Q.	The meeting that you saw from behind the window, you said you were standing on the table.  How long did that last, approximately, do you recall? 
A.	No.  No.  In any event, it did not last more than an hour. 
Q.	Witness, have you had to testify in Rwanda in any case before the courts? 
A.	No, never. 
Q.	And have you ever had to testify in Gacaca proceedings? 
A.	No. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Very well.  Mr. President, I have completed my cross-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  Re-examination?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
No, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This was the end of your testimony, Madam Witness.  Thank you for having come the long way to Arusha to testify.  We wish you a very safe journey home.  Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you very much.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's 11 o'clock.  Time for the break.  The next witness's pseudonym is -- 
MS. MELLUISH: 
AWN.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  We will, then, start with that just after the break, about 20 minutes to come.  The Court is adjourned. 
(Court recessed from 1058H to 1130H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, Madam Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
There's an administrative issue before we start your testimony. 

Are there any exhibits to be tendered by the Defence in connection with the previous witness?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, thank you.  I cross-examined the witness on one of her statements, but the answer was a bit fluffy, so I do not intend to enter that document into evidence.  Thank you.

testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Madam Witness, what area were you living in in March 1994? 
A.	In March 1994, I lived in Kigali city in Rugenge secteur.   (By order of the Court, this portion of evidence was extracted and kept under separate cover) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We do not want all those details, and we'll place under seal the reference to the cellule.  

Video booth, please do not transmit that.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Who were you living with at that time? 
A.	I was living with my father, my mother, my brothers, as well as my younger sister, and my older sister.  
Q.	How many brothers did you have? 
A.	I had two brothers. 
Q.	After the 6th of April 1994, did you remain living at home with those people? 
A.	I did not quite understand your question.  Which period are you referring to, ma'am?  
Q.	Let's put it like this, on the 6th of April 1994, were you living at home?  
A.	Yes, I was at home.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And the witness mentioned the secteur again, Mr. President. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	And you were living on the 6th of April with those family members you've just described to us, is that right?  
A.	On the 6th of April 1994, I was at home with my father and other family members, excepting my mother and younger sister who had gone to see my grandmother in Gitarama. 
Q.	After that date, did you see your mother and younger sister again? 
A.	I didn't see them throughout that period until July.  It was only after the war that I saw them again. 
Q.	So on the 6th of April, you were with some of your family, your father and some of your siblings.  Did you and they remain at home after that date? 
A.	Yes.  We remained together at home.  That is, I, my father, my two brothers, as well as my sister.  
Q.	And for how long did you all remain at home together? 
A.	We stayed at home up to the 19th when Interahamwe attacked our house and killed my father and brothers.  So up to that date we had remained at home. 
Q.	Can you recall how many Interahamwe were involved in the attack in which your father and brother were killed? 
A.	There were perhaps four of them, but I remember only one name.  That of one gentleman called Kabyola (sic.).
MS. MELLUISH: 
Don't think that's on the list, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
If it's not on the list, we need the spelling, please.  Can you help us, Madam?
THE WITNESS:
K-A-B-I-N-A (sic).  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just say the name again without spelling it, please. 
THE WITNESS:
Kabiyona. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And according to the booth, that should, then, be spelled how, please?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
K-A-B-I-Y-O-N-A, says the Kinyarwanda booth. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Madam Witness, were you yourself present when this attack took place and your father and brothers were killed? 
A.	I was present. 
Q.	And after that happened, what did you do? 
A.	After the Interahamwe attack, which led to the death of my father and brothers, the attackers forced my elder sister to drink a full bottle of whiskey.  And when I asked her to leave the house together with me, she told me she could not leave with me.  Rather, she begged me to go, and that she would pray for me.  So I left, but my elder sister remained behind.  
Q.	And where did you go when you left? 
A.	When I left our home, I went to the home of the conseiller, because that conseiller had been my mother's friend, and I thought she could give me assistance by me taking shelter in her home. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court the name of the conseiller whose home you went to? 
A.	Our conseiller was called Odette Nyirabagenzi. 
Q.	And when you got to her house, what did you find there? 
A.	When I arrived at her place, the conseiller was not in, but present were her younger sister and another girl, first named Kayitesi.  There was another gentleman called Etienne, as well as his wife and children.  There were also two young boys there, sons of one Ibambasi.  
Q.	Are you able to spell that name that you've just given us, Ibambasi? 
A.	I-B-A-M-B-A-S-I. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the other two names were Etienne, which is easy, and Kayitesi, K-A-Y-I-T-E-S-I, I assume.  
THE WITNESS:
Correct, Mr. President. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	How were you received when you got to the conseiller's house? 
A.	When I arrived at the conseiller's, I was relieved because I already knew that young girl called Kayitesi.  But since the conseiller was not in, I was asked to wait for her arrival because no one apart from her could authorise anyone to stay at her home.  
Q.	And did the conseiller arrive at some stage? 
A.	Yes.  The conseiller returned in the evening. 
Q.	Was the conseiller alone when she returned, or accompanied by another, or others? 
A.	The conseiller was putting on a military trench coat, and she also had a firearm.  The weapon she was carrying was known as G3, so she was in military attire and was with other Interahamwe, one of whom was called Gisenyi. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just like the area, Gisenyi?  
THE WITNESS:
It is true that there was a préfecture with the same name, but we often called that person Gisenyi.  I don't know whether it was his real name, or whether it was an alias.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So the spelling was the same, yes?  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	And how did the conseiller receive you when she returned? 
A.	When the conseiller came there, I did not go to see her because of the Interahamwe.  But her younger sister told her that there was a child from the home of someone -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
-- and which the witness mentioned.
THE WITNESS:
And so the conseiller asked that I come and see her.  So I told her that I wanted to hide at her home because my father and brothers had just been killed.  The conseiller denied my request, saying that one could not go and hide at her place to escape death.  That even if she wanted, she could kill me.  So she asked me to leave because her home could not be a hiding place.  Her younger sister insisted.  I think that they had other reasons.  Subsequently, the conseiller accepted that I stay there because she remembered that she used to drink beer with my mother.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the English booth, the witness mentioned the name of someone who may have been one of the parents, and the English interpreter didn't mention it.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Witness, you have now on two occasions referred to family members.  We are in open session and you must not do that, please.  So it was picked up by the English translation, preventing that the name came out.  But in the French version we will place the reference under 11:48:08 under seal.  

Video booth, please do not transmit this.  

Next question, please. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	You said you think they had other reasons.  What do you mean by that?  
A.	I think that the reason why her younger sister was insisting that I stay there was because subsequently ********************************************************************************************************.  And since ******************************************************************************************************************* in that duty.  
Q.	As far as you are aware, did the conseiller know what ethnic origin you had?  
A.	I think she knew, because I told her I was not a Tutsi.  I insisted in saying that I was a Hutu when I was begging her to accommodate me at her place.  But she called her daughter and asked the policemen and the Interahamwe why they had killed someone who was of the same ethnicity as them.  But she continued, rather, by saying that there was no similarity between my physical features and those of her daughter.  So I answered her that I had always thought I was a Hutu.  
Q.	For how long did you stay at the house of the conseiller? 
A.	I think I spent about one month there.  
Q.	Besides yourself and the conseiller, how many other people were staying at that house during that time?  
A.	Do you mean at the conseiller's own residence?  
Q.	Yes.  
A.	About eight people had come to seek refuge there.  I was there with Kayitesi, the two sons of Ibambasi, Etienne, his wife and children.  So there were eight people who had come to seek refuge there.  But there were lots of other Interahamwe there, I can't know the numbers. 
Q.	And what about the conseiller, did she live alone or with family members or anyone else? 
A.	Her brother and younger sister, as well as the children of the conseiller.  There were also the children of the conseiller's younger sister. 
Q.	Do you recall the name of the conseiller's brother? 
A.	The conseiller's brother's name was Munanira. 
MS. MELLUISH:  
That's number 158, Your Honour.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Now, generally, during the period of about a month that you stayed at that house, what happened there?  
A.	During the time when I was at the conseiller's place, the conseiller and the Interahamwe would get up in the morning, go out, and then would come back later.  ***************************************.  All of the activities hinged on massacre operations.  They would go out, kill, then come back.  
Q.	And how do you know that when they went out, they would kill? 
A.	I got to learn of it because on one occasion the conseiller came when we were busy **********************, and the conseiller said that one André Kameya, who was a journalist at Kinyamateka, had been flushed out after a long period when he was being hunted down.  So he was flushed out from the Kinyamateka premises.  And the conseiller narrated how he had been executed.  And judging from the tone of her voice, the Interahamwe were actually pleased with the way they had conducted that operation.  Because they first tortured the victim by cutting off some of his limbs.  So I realised that whenever they went out, it was to go and kill.  
Q.	Now, why was it you left the house after about a month?  
A.	There was a problem at the conseiller's.  You see, that conseiller sold beer at her home.  And a bottle of beer cost 800 francs, but her younger sister sold a bottle of beer for 1,000 francs and she used the extra money to buy beer for herself.  When the conseiller returned, I think she carried out a control, and she learned that her younger sister had asked the clients to pay more.  So she started remonstrating.  And her younger sister said that it was because there were many Tutsi at her residence she had been confused.  So the conseiller decided to drive ****************** away from her home.  
Q.	And where did you go when you left? 
A.	The conseiller told us to leave very early in the morning before the killings were to start, and I thought I could not walk up to our home because it was a long distance and the road had a number of roadblocks.  So I begged the conseiller's brother to accompany me.  He said he could not escort me during the day, that I had to wait until the evening when he would be able to escort me right up to my home.  
Q.	And did that happen?  Or did something else happen?  
A.	So he made that offer, and actually took me, rather, to his home.  But in the evening, instead of taking me back to my home, he wanted to rape me.  So I begged him and told him that I was in my period, but that afterwards I will be amenable to his overtures.  
Q.	And what happened after that? 
A.	I lied to him, saying that I had my period, and he understood what I said and took me home.  And when we got there, I found an Interahamwe called Matata who was there, so I felt I was in security.  Matata said he heard that I was in a conseiller's house with my elder sister.  The Interahamwe promised that nothing was going to happen, and that anyone who will attack us will have to deal with he himself first. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Matata is number 132 on the list. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Can you explain why the presence of this Interahamwe called Matata meant you felt secure? 
A.	I felt safe because Matata was an Interahamwe.  He was a strong person, and he was carrying a weapon.  He had a firearm and grenades, and he was a family friend.  So when he told me that, I felt safe.  I was reassured.  His parents were my parents' friends, so I had confidence in him. 
Q.	Did you say that your older sister was also at your home with Matata, or have I misunderstood your evidence? 
A.	Yes.  When I got to the house, Matata had already found my elder sister and brought her home.  I don't know where he found her.  
Q.	Now, with Matata at your house, were you safe? 
A.	We did not have any problem in relation to the previous situation.  But when I told the person who saved -- Munanira to come and see me after my period, he actually came.  But he came when Matata was not there, and I could not resist him.  A child saw the event -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And witness has given her name. 
THE WITNESS:
-- and he said so-and-so has been abducted.  So Matata came and followed us all the way to the Sainte Famille.  So he took me by one hand, and Matata took me by the other hand.  Matata was telling me to go back home; Munanira was pulling me the other way.  And Matata realised, and it was a difficult situation.  So he took a grenade.  He removed the safety pin and said that if Munanira refused to leave me, he was going to throw the grenade and we are all going to die.  And when Munanira realised that he was going to die, he released me, and Matata took me home.  And when we got home, about 15 minutes following our arrival home, the conseiller came aboard a vehicle in the company of policemen, and Interahamwe, including Munanira, and told Matata that the Tutsi girl who is with him should come and see the conseiller in her office.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
In which house are we now, Madam Witness?  Who is the owner of the house in which we find ourselves just now, according to your testimony?  
THE WITNESS:
This happened in our house. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
In your family's house?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	How long after you returned to your own home from Odette's house was it that this incident you're relating took place?  Was it the same day, or some days later, some weeks later, some months later?  
A.	It was a few days later.  Munanira had to come to see me after my period, so it was a few days later.  Let's say about a week, but I have no clear recollection of that.  
Q.	Now, after the conseiller arrived at your house, you said that she instructed that you be taken to the secteur office? 
A.	That is what she told Matata.  She told him to come to the secteur office together with the Tutsi girl who was with him. 
Q.	And did you go to the secteur office with Matata, or not? 
A.	We left immediately.  The others left with him, and Matata and myself went on foot.  
Q.	And what about Munanira, where was he at this time?  
A.	Munanira left, together with the conseiller, aboard a vehicle. 
Q.	How long did it take you to get to the secteur office?  
A.	About five minutes.  The secteur office was not far from my parents' house. 
Q.	When you got to the secteur office, what did you find there?  
A.	When I got there, the conseiller and Munanira were already there.  I also found there the responsable of our cellule, who is called ***************.  Those are the persons that I found there. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
************* is not on the list, but I believe it's *****************.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	And when you got to the office, what did you do? 
A.	When we got there, this ********* looked at me in a contemptuous manner and said, "So you -- you are the one who refused to sleep with this man".  They had spoken about it, so he made this comment. 
Q.	Was anything else said to you while you were at the secteur office? 
A.	At that point, I saw a vehicle arrive, and there were soldiers and the préfet of Kigali-ville in that vehicle.  The préfet was called Tharcisse Renzaho.  So I saw this vehicle arrive with the préfet and those soldiers.  I thought he came there to see what was happening because there were a lot of people at the secteur office.  So he asked what was happening, and I explained to him that I refused to marry somebody.  And he said that this is the time to show Tutsi women, and that the Hutus are strong and can do whatever they wanted to do with them.  I don't know what he wanted to say.  I don't know if he meant that they could rape them.  But that is what I heard him say.

1215H
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	And how far away from you was he when he said that? 
A.	There was a distance of about 3 to 4 metres between us. 
Q.	Had you seen the préfet before that date? 
A.	Yes, I had seen him, I was in primary 4, and there were elections for conseillers, and that was -- it was during those elections that the conseiller, Odette, was elected.  There were candidates, Odette and Sebushishi, who were MDR.  And, during the campaign, the préfet arrived and people were saying the préfet was here.  People went to see him and it was on that occasion that I also saw him. 
Q.	And on the day that you've been telling us about when you saw him at the secteur office, can you describe the man that you saw? 
A.	He was a stocky man who was wearing spectacles and who was bald.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the two candidates during the elections were Odette and Sebushishi, 255.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Madam Witness, I'd -- I'd like you to see if you can identify Renzaho today.  Could you please stand up, could you have a look around the courtroom at the various people in it, and could you tell us, do you see Tharcisse Renzaho? 
A.	I can see the person I saw on that occasion.  
Q.	Could you tell us, please, where in the courtroom he is sitting? 
A.	He's sitting in the first row and close to the window.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is a positive identification. 
MS. MELLUISH:
Thank you, you may sit down again. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Now, besides what you have told us he said, did Renzaho say anything else at the secteur office that you heard? 
A.	He made that statement and then he spoke to Nyirabagenzi, but I could not hear their conversation.  And after that conversation, he climbed on board his vehicle and left.  
Q.	And what happened to you after he left? 
A.	After his departure, Nyirabagenzi first called Munanira -- or, she spoke to Munanira loudly, and said that she was going to do her best to ensure that this Tutsi girl begs him -- for him to have -- to have sex with him.  And then, he spoke to -- and then she spoke to Matata and left. 
Q.	And then what did you do after she left? 
A.	After her departure, I left with Matata to the house.  I thought there was no further problem and it was all over.  
Q.	And was it all over? 
A.	That is what I thought, but when we got home, a few days later, Munanira came again.  It was in the evening, and he was in the company of another Interahamwe -- or, other Interahamwe called 
	Sese Seko and Gisenyi.  And they took us away -- my elder sister and myself. 
MS. MELLUISH:
Sese Seko is 257.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Where were you and your sister taken to? 
A.	They took us to their headquarters, it was in town.  It was close to the SEFA office.  I don't know the exact name of the locality. 
Q.	Can you spell SEFA for us, please? 
A.	It's an acronym and I don't know the exact name of that building.  That is how people used to call 
the -- the place.  But that was not the real name of the locality.  What I know is that that building is close to Hotel Pan Africa. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Booth, is SEFA spelt S-E-F-A?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	When you got to this house, what happened? 
A.	When we got there, Munanira raped me.  He raped me.  When we got there, Munanira immediately raped me.  And after that, he told his colleagues that previously I had refused to sleep with him, so they could also do whatever they wanted to do with me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, we realise that this is very painful and whenever you need a break, a glass of water, a handkerchief, just let us know.  
THE WITNESS:
I have all those things, Mr. President - and, thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Next question, please. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Did the other Interahamwe do anything? 
A.	Munanira -- Munanira hurt me because I refused to sleep with him and so he asked them to come -- he told them to come and also have a taste of a Tutsi woman.  
Q.	And what, if anything, did they do after he said that to them? 
A.	They also raped me.  They raped me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And now, Madam Witness, you have referred to these other persons, who were they, please? 
THE WITNESS:
They were Sese Seko, and another one called Bikomago -- and Gisenyi.  Those are the names I remember.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Bikomago is number 17? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Yes.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	What about your sister?  You said that you were taken together to this place; do you know what happened to her there? 
A.	We were together in the same room -- and when they raped us, we were together. 
Q.	For how long did this ordeal last? 
A.	We remained in that place for some days, and then subsequently, they took us home.  They would take us home and come back for us at night.  But the second or third day, they took us together with our neighbour, called (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted from the transcript and kept under separate cover) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We need to place that name under seal.  

Please do not transmit that video booth, but we still need the spelling.  Would you be able, 
Madam Witness, to write that name on a piece of paper, please? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIENT: 
We will place that document under seal and enter it as the next Prosecution exhibit.  

Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA:
P. 85.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
(Exhibit No. P. 85 admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
The next question, please? 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Madam Witness, you were saying that these Interahamwe came back to your house and took you, your sister and your neighbour away.  How many times did they happen, do you recall? 
A.	The day they took us together with our neighbour, they did not bring us back home.  They kept us at their headquarters.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This person whose name you wrote on a piece of paper, what was the ethnicity of that girl, please? 
THE WITNESS:
She was a Tutsi because members of her family had been killed and she had sought refuge with her aunt, who was a neighbour.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	For how long were you kept at those headquarters? 
A.	About one month. 
Q.	And while you were there, what happened to you? 
A.	They continued raping us.  
Q.	What happened at the end of that month that meant that you no longer were kept at those headquarters? 
A.	The headquarters was continuously shelled, so they moved us from that place -- and they almost stopped the raping.  They placed us at the Sainte Famille site and became more occupied in the front.  
Q.	And do you recall in what month it was that you went - or, you were taken to the Sainte Famille site? 
A.	I think it was in late June -- towards the end of June.  
Q.	And after moving to Sainte Famille, were you or your sister raped or subjected to sexual violence at all? 
A.	That did not happen again when we'd gone to the Sainte Famille.  It was as if they had stopped the raping, because the war had intensified a great deal, and it was said that the Inkotanyi had entered into the city.  But another fille -- another girl --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Correction -- 
THE WITNESS:
called Hyacinthe Rwanga and another one called, Nyiratunga, were raped.  I saw them when they were being led away by Father Munyeshaka. 
MS. MELLUISH:
That -- that second name is 205.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	And how do you know that they were raped?  
MS. MELLUISH:
Oh, sorry. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Let us also agree on the first name, shall we? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Hyacinthe or Hyacinthe Rwanga is number 245. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And now, the question?  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	How do you know that these two girls were raped?  
A.	The priest who'd come and take them, they would come back later on, and the people who were there discussed it.  Those people said that Munyeshyaka was the one raping them.  
Q.	For how long did you remain at the Sainte Famille? 
A.	I didn't stay at that site for a long time because the war ended a few days subsequently.  
Q.	And after the end of the war, what state of health were you in? 
A.	At the end of the war, I did not have any problems, but my mother, who had been made aware that we had been raped, took us to a centre called ARBEF for testing, and we tested positive for HIV -- I and my elder sister -- ARBEF is A-R-B-E-F. 
Q.	And besides that, were there any other effects on you and your sister of having been raped, as you've described? 
A.	I was with child, but I gave a stillbirth.  But my sister had a child -- the baby subsequently fell ill.  
Q.	Finally, Madam Witness, do you recall how old you were in April 1994? 
A.	In April 1994, I was 14, because I was born in ************* of the year 1980.  
Q.	Thank you, I have no further questions for you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you should try to place in time when you saw the préfet making that utterance, which you quoted, in which month did this event take place? 
THE WITNESS:
I would say it was in May -- towards late May, because I went to the conseiller's in April, and she drove me out of her home in mid-May. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Defence? 
MR. NEKUIE:
I'm obliged, Mr. President. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Good day, Witness.  
A.	Good day, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness, to start our examination, let us try and place in time when you first saw Mr. Renzaho.  When you say it was at the time of the elections, in which year would you say did those elections take place? 
A.	I no longer remember the year, but I do recall, however, that I was in primary school then. 
Q.	If I can give you certain indications, was it one or two years before the war broke out, for instance? 
A.	Are you referring to the 1994 war, Counsel? 
Q.	Yes, Witness.  
A.	Yes, let's say, two years before the 1994 war.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  So at that time, you were about 12 years old and you were already interested in politics? 
A.	No, I was not interested in politics because I was still young then, but since the elections were taking place in our school centre, we had gone to see what was going on there.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Concerning Mr. Renzaho's arrival in the secteur office, you said he had arrived there in a military vehicle, is that what you said? 
A.	Even though that vehicle may not have been a military vehicle, during the war it was usual that vehicles be camouflaged such that they would look like military vehicles.  
Q.	So, actually, if I understand you properly, you cannot remember exactly what type of vehicle he was in when he arrived there.  Is that what we should understand, Witness? 
A.	Did you say the type of vehicle? 
Q.	Yes, Witness, was it a military or a civilian vehicle?  Now, if you cannot remember, then we'll move on.  
A.	I don't know whether it was a military or civilian vehicle, but there were certain features which gave the impression that it was a military vehicle, amongst which were the colours -- they were camouflaged colours.  
Q.	Very well.  Witness, if I understand your evidence, Mr. Renzaho seemingly intervened to say something because you were still resisting the advances of Munanira, who was the conseiller's brother, would that be the case? 
A.	I am not aware of that, I simply saw him arrive there.  I do not know whether he had been called because I had refused to sleep with that person -- or whether he was simply passing by.  All that I know is that he stopped at the secteur office.  I thought it was perhaps he had seen people gathered at the secteur office, but I don't know what was the real reason for his presence there.  
Q.	Witness, when in an answer to Prosecution counsel you said Mr. Renzaho had come there seemingly to see what was going on, what did you mean? 
A.	What I meant was that there was a crowd at the secteur office.  You certainly understand that whoever realises that there is a crowd at a given place would want to know what is going on.  And, in his capacity as the préfet of the préfecture, it was but normal for him to be curious because of the crowding at the secteur office, which secteur he hailed from.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, let me try and read out to you an excerpt of the statement which you gave to officers of the Prosecution on the 20th of October 2004.  That is the date of interview, in which statement you signed on the 7th of December 2004.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, Your Honours, it is the witness statement which I just gave the date for, and I am actually looking at the other side of page 4 in the French version, with reference K0339804.  It's page 5 of the French.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, where do you want to start on that page?  There are no paragraphs.  
MR. NEKUIE:
I'm starting with the portion where it says that, on the right side, "Matata and I went to the secteur office where we saw many people."  That is a free translation.  "Matata and I went to the secteur office where we saw many people."  It is about 15 or 20 lines from the bottom.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says Counsel.  
MR. NEKUIE:
It is 17 lines from the bottom, Mr. President.  And at the extreme right, he (sic) says: "Matata and I walked to the secteur office" -- in the English.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have found it.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, let me read that portion out to you and this is what you told the officials of the Prosecution.  

"Matata and I walked to the secteur office where we met so many people.  I later realised that the people were gathered there ******************************************************************************
********************************.  The truth was I had refused to sleep with him.  Odette remarked that Munanira should not worry and that she would make me beg him to sleep with me.  It was here that I saw Renzaho, the préfet of Kigali, who I knew before the war."  

I'd like to end there, Witness, for now and put the following question to you:  With regard to what you said, did you see Renzaho there when you arrived there -- or, as you stated before this Trial Chamber?  Did Renzaho come there when you were there already? 
A.	Renzaho came to the secteur office while I was there already. 
Q.	And what about the rumour that you had refused Mr. Munanira's advances, had that rumour been spreading already? 
A.	The vehicle carrying Munanira, the conseiller, and the other Interahamwe from my place to the -- to the secteur office had already left.  And during the war, the Interahamwe were always making noise, saying what was going on and all what they were going to do.  Given that when the Interahamwe went back to the secteur office, they already knew that I had turned down Munanira's sexual advances, they made it known to all those who lent them their ears.  So, they certainly told the people who were at the secteur office that the Tutsi girl had refused Munanira's sexual advances.  
Q.	So, Witness, it is possible that Mr. Renzaho also heard the rumour and he had gone there to see what was going on?  That is the way I understood the answer you gave to Prosecution counsel, correct? 
A.	I don't know whether Renzaho was aware of that -- whether he had received information about that.  I simply saw him arrive at that place.  I do not know whether he knew what was going to happen at the secteur office or otherwise.  
Q.	Witness, let us look at the account of the tragic disappearance of your father and brothers.  You told this Court that four or five Interahamwe were the co-perpetrators of their murders, correct? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	Before taking this issue further, you told the Prosecutor that you had two brothers.  Were those two brothers of yours murdered on the same day or was it only one of them -- and, if that is the case, what happened to the other brother? 
A.	Only one of my brothers was killed that day, but the second one survived and he is still alive.  
Q.	Very well, Witness.  Witness, if Munanira needed only four Interahamwe to help him murder your brother and father, do you think that in order for him to rape you, it was necessary for him to seek the interventions of other people than the assistance of his friends? 
A.	It was not Munanira who killed my family members, rather, it was the Interahamwe called Kabiyona, who came with the other Interahamwe to kill my family members.  The episode concerning Munanira started when I arrived at the conseiller's home.  Munanira was not present when my father and brother were killed.  
Q.	Thank you for that correction.  Actually, my question to you, Witness, was whether it sufficed for four or five Interahamwe to come to your home and murder your relatives, do you think that for Munanira to rape you, he needed the intervention of his sister, the conseiller, as well as the préfet? 
A.	It was not necessary for him to be aided by those two people, but since I had turned down his advances and I felt safe with Matata -- if, actually, I had accepted his advances before then, I don't think all what happened would have happened.  Rather, I think that Munanira went and told his sister and the other people that Matata had been protecting certain Tutsi.  That is what complicated things and that was the reason why we were summoned to the secteur office.  
Q.	And when you saw Mr. Renzaho come to the secteur office on that day, do you remember exactly the people accompanying him? 
A.	I noticed that the people accompanying him were in military attire and were carrying firearms.  I don't know whether they were bona fide soldiers or otherwise.  
Q.	And, Witness, when you say that some days later on, Munanira came back to look for you, as far as you remember, how many days elapsed between the time when Mr. Renzaho came to the secteur office and the day when Munanira came back for you? 
A.	You want me to give you the number of days between the two dates?  I would say it was a time span of about two weeks.  
Q.	And that two-week period, Witness, when would you place it?  In May or in June?  Because we are not quite able to understand the exact sequencing in the dates which you've been giving us, Witness. 
A.	I'm unable to give you specific dates, sir, but if I take as a point of reference the date when my family members were killed and my departure from the conseiller's home, I believe I left the conseiller's place in mid-May, and I think Munanira came to look for me at home, perhaps one week afterwards.  It may have been in the month of June, but, you know, all those things happened a long time ago.  It is impossible for me to remember with text-book precision all those things, and one does not like to reminisce about all those things.  Honestly, I'm unable to give you a specific date.  
Q.	I understand you perfectly, Witness, but when in your statement you said as follows -- 
MR. NEKUIE:
And, Mr. President, Your Honours, I am still referring to the same page, towards the end, and I'm going to quote what the witness said.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q. 	"One month after this incident, towards the end of May 1994, Munanira and an Interahamwe named Bikomago came to our house."  And I'll end the quotation here.  When you mentioned the period "one month", were you mistaken, Witness? 
A.	I don't quite understand what your problem is.  You said I was mistaken when I said they came to our home around end of May? 
Q.	That is not what I said, Witness.  I'm simply refreshing your recollection of what you said.  You said it was one month after the incident.  So when you say, "One month after the incident" then you cannot remember the time which elapsed between Renzaho's arrival and Munanira's arrival at your home? 
A.	My statement was recorded in 2004; that war had taken place in 1994, so there was a 10-year period between those two dates.  I could be mistaken, but I must admit that right up until this point, I don't quite understand your question.  
Q.	Witness, I just want us to have a clear idea of specific dates.  But since you don't understand, then I'm going to note your hypothesis that it was at the end of May that Munanira came to your home and you told the Court that they held you for about three weeks, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And at the end of the three weeks, they took you to the Sainte Famille parish, correct? 
A.	Yes, when we left their headquarters, after three weeks, we were moved to the Sainte Famille site.  
Q.	So you arrived there practically towards the end of the month of June, is that the way I should construe your evidence? 
A.	Are you referring to the Sainte Famille church? 
Q.	Absolutely, Witness.  
A.	Yes, you're right, Counsel.  
Q.	And Witness, it was at your arrival that you saw that Hyacinthe and the two others were being constantly taken away about Father Munyeshyaka? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Witness, are you certain that at your arrival, which -- would you say, was in end of June 1994, you actually saw Hyacinthe and the other girl, whose name you gave, and who were being constantly taken away by Father Munyeshyaka?  
A.	Yes, I'm certain of that because I personally saw him come for those two young girls.  It's possible that the date -- or, the month which I gave were not correct.  But personally, I saw Munyeshyaka come for those two girls -- but as I just said, it's possible that I was mistaken regarding the month.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, should I move on or allow the Honourable Bench to adjourn?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It depends on your estimate on how much is left.  If it rather brief, then we would prefer to finish the testimony.  If it is not brief, then we have to adjourn.  What is your assessment of the situation? 
MR. NEKUIE:
I have just a few questions for the, Witness, actually, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, I'm really sorry that I have to put questions to you without having a clear idea of the dates when you say you experienced those painful events.  But, I'll just have to move on by putting the following question to you.  Apart from the fact that you saw Hyacinthe and the other girl being constantly taken away by Father Munyeshyaka, what other memorable events did you witness at the Sainte Famille? 
A.	I stayed at the Sainte Famille parish site for a short time and I did not see anything unusual -- apart from the fact that I saw the Interahamwe, who came there to abduct people.  Otherwise, there's nothing else which I noticed.  But on one occasion, I saw UNAMIR troops who came there looking for refugees, but they were refused access into the premises.  I remember that when the war ended, I had just spent a few days at the Sainte Famille church site.  
Q.	And was it while you were at that site that you witnessed the end of the war -- or, were you at some point in time evacuated from that site? 
A.	I was at the Sainte Famille church site when the war ended.  
Q.	Witness, if I put it to you that you could not have seen Hyacinthe when you arrived at that site, because she had already been killed a long time before your arrival, what would you say? 
A.	I would challenge your assertion because I saw her.  
Q.	And, Witness, if I put it to you that you also could not have seen Mr. Renzaho in the secteur office, because it was not necessary for him to intervene -- for Munanira to have his way with you, what would you say to that? 
A.	I did not assert that the préfet had come to the secteur office to allow -- or to assist Munanira to have his way with me.  The préfet was passing by.  I don't know whether he had -- he was passing by and he had stopped there because of the crowding or because of the incident.  Neither do I assert that he had come there to assist Munanira in any way for him to have his way with me.  I simply saw the préfet there.  And, Munanira, the conseiller, and the Interahamwe were strong enough to do whatever they wanted to with me.  It was not necessary for the préfet to personally come down to that place.  On that occasion, the préfet arrived there and he asked what had happened.  Then, he made the utterances which I narrated here.  I cannot assert that that was the purpose of his trip to that place, but I simply noticed what I noticed and I heard what he said.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Ultimate question, which can help shed light:  Can you tell us what is the meaning of AVEGA?  A-V-E-G-A.  
A.	AVEGA means association of widows of the genocide, I am not certain -- I think it means association of widows for the genocide -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, Your Honours, this is the end of the Defence cross-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Re-examination? 
MS. MELLUISH:
No, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This was the end of your testimony, Madam Witness.  Thank you for having come the long way to Arusha to testify.  We wish you a very safe journey home.  Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will continue at 2:45, and the pseudonym of the next witness is?  
MR. MOSES:
UI, Your Honours.  Perhaps, if I could at this stage, also indicate on Friday we realised that UI had testified under a different pseudonym.  On Friday, we gave the transcripts of his testimony to the Defence.  I understand it's not -- I understand it's not causing any difficulty, but my friend might wish to indicate otherwise.  We filed them officially today, but as they're probably not on your folders, I have French and English copies for Your Honours, if there's going to be any use or reference made of it during the course of the cross-examination.  

I can indicate that the testimony is likely to take perhaps one and a half to two hours.  So that if -- if there was any matters that were wanting -- my friend was wanting to raise regarding that testimony, which he feels there's been any problems, then perhaps we could leave it till the morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the following witness will be, after UI?  
MR. MOSES:
AWO.  Can I also perhaps at this stage, make a comment regarding the last three witnesses.  
Your Honours, all three are due to arrive this afternoon in Arusha.  All three are -- amongst other testimony -- are all rape victims.  All three need to be prepared for their testimony, and it's obviously more sensitive perhaps than some other witnesses.  We've arranged matters so that Ms. Melluish is, in fact, going to lead the evidence of the three women who will be testifying.  She'll be able to see two of them this evening.  She's indicated to -- prepare -- prepare them.  It may be at the end of those two testimonies, if there is -- has not been an opportunity, perhaps tomorrow morning for her to see the third witness, that we may request a -- perhaps a longer lunch break than necessary for her to be able 
to -- to see and prepare that -- the last of the witnesses.  

So, can I just alert Your Honours to that?  That it -- it may be that we don't need any such adjournment, but can I put you on notice that there could be circumstances arising for that application.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Any comments by the Defence at this stage? 
MR. CANTIER:
No, Mr. President, no comment.  Indeed, my learned friend on Friday afternoon handed the transcripts of a trial where that witness testified.  It's quite bulky, but I availed myself over the weekend to peruse through the literature, so I don't need an extension of the time frames.  I think the reading so far is quite convenient, and I don't have any problems.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much for that remark.  

We will then resume at 2:45, but you had an additional issue, Maître Nekuie.  Was that linked to the document you used during cross-examination? 
MR. NEKUIE:
That's right, Mr. President, which I would like to tender.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
And we'll do that immediately after the break.  Thank you.  

The Court is adjourned. 
(Court recessed from 1314H to 1450H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will just tender an exhibit and then we will start with your testimony.  

You wanted to tender the interview dated 20th of October 2004, is that so? 
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, indeed, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The French version being B, the A version, being the English as it has been signed, under seal.  Mr. Matemanga, number?  
MR. MATEMANGA:
D. 26.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
(Exhibit No. D. 26A and D. 26B admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Mr. Witness, you will be referred to as Witness AWN in these proceedings -- 
MR. MOSES:
No, Your Honour, he's under a different pseudonym.  
THE PRESIDENT:
You will not be referred to as Witness AWN in these proceedings, Mr. Witness, you will be referred to as Witness UI in these proceedings.  You have to tell the truth and the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
(Declaration made by Witness UI in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have a document there with your signature, isn't that so? 

THE WITNESS:
I do have the document before me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And this means that the information contained in that document is correct, isn't that so? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA:
P. 86. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal.  
(Exhibit No. P. 86 admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Open or closed? 
MR. MOSES:
To commence in open -- and then we'll go into closed a later bit later, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please do.  
MR. MOSES:
Sorry, has the witness been sworn in?  Oh, he was.  I'm sorry, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I just took the wrong document for UI and let's hope this will not continue.  
MR. MOSES:
I certainly hope so.  
WITNESS UI,
first having been sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, please, without telling us where you were living, can you please tell the Trial Chamber where you were on the morning of the 7th of April 1994? 
A.	Thank you.  In the morning of the 7th of April 1994, I was at the JOC in Kigali.  
Q.	Now, the JOC that you are talking about, what institutions is that close to?  Is it near any buildings or other institutions? 
A.	Yes, the JOC was not far from a centre called CELA.  And, besides, JOC was not that far from the Sainte Famille church either, as well as from the Saint Paul centre.  
Q.	Now, on the 7th of April, did anything unusual happen whilst you were at the JOC? 
A.	On the 7th of April 1994, there was something that happened.  We heard gunshots not far from the place where we were.  I went out to see what was happening and I noted that a young woman had been injured.  She was the one who told us about the event that had taken place.  So there was an incident that occurred on that date.  
Q.	And what did this young girl tell you? 
A.	The young girl told us that the soldiers had arrived and had entered their home and had forced the young women to come out.  The soldiers set the young Tutsi girls aside -- on one side and the Hutu girls on another side, and subsequently, the soldiers shot the group of young Tutsi girls -- I thank you.  
Q.	Where had these girls been prior -- do you know -- prior to the soldiers arriving? 
A.	The young girls also lived at the JOC, there was a home in which the young girls lived.  
Q.	Now, you say you saw a young girl who had been injured, did you see any evidence of young girls having been shot? 
A.	Yes, there was evidence because there were the -- there were bodies of some of the victims.  I do not know who had covered the bodies with blankets, and the one I told you about was injured and was bleeding.  
Q.	What, if anything, was done with the bodies of those girls who had been covered with blankets? 
A.	Subsequently, the people who had been hiding at the CELA centre buried some of the dead bodies.  
Q.	And do you know where these girls were buried? 
A.	Yes, I know more or less where the bodies were buried.  
Q.	And where were they buried? 
A.	At the CELA centre.  If you go past the two blocks of buildings, further down, there was a garden which was divided into two parts:  One part with a banana plantation and the other one with just grass, and it is on that side, the grass side, that the bodies were buried.  
Q.	Thank you, now -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know approximately how many Tutsis girls that were killed? 
THE WITNESS:
I do not know how many were killed.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Five, 15, 50, just an estimate? 
THE WITNESS:
Well, there were less than five young girls.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Less than five? 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Approximately what time of day on the 7th was it that it occurred? 
A.	It was during the morning before 10 a.m., let us say between 9 and 9:30.  
Q.	And, as a result of seeing these bodies, did you personally do anything? 
A.	Personally, I took time to think and I realised that I was not safe.  Other persons in my -- and myself, decided to go and take refuge at the CELA centre.  That is what I did.  
Q.	Why did you go to the CELA centre? 
A.	I decided to go to the CELA centre, because it was a religious centre and we thought we'll be safer there than elsewhere.  
Q.	When you say it was a religious centre, do you know who was in charge of it? 
A.	That centre belonged to a congregation of white priests, and the one leading -- directing the centre was called Jacques Vleugls -- Jeff Vleugls. 
MR. MOSES:
It's number 281 on the latest revised list, sir.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And did you know Father Vleugls? 
A.	I knew him.  
Q.	How did you know him? 
A.	I used to attend mass in that centre.  He's one of the priests who say mass there, that is how I came to know him.  
Q.	Did you know the names of any of the other White Fathers who were there? 
A.	I knew some -- such as, Ireneé, Jacob.  There were about four priests in that centre. 
MR. MOSES:
Ireneé-- Jacob Ireneé is not on the list, Your Honour, but I understand the spelling is I-R-E-N -- and acute È, N-È (sic) -- acute É.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that the entire name or -- 
MR. MOSES:
Yes, Jacob -- it was Ireneé Jacob was the way in which it was -- it came across.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you now trying to convey both a surname and a first name, will you help us with both, please?  
MR. MOSES:
The first name is Jacob, J-A-C-O-B, and the surname is Ireneé. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
These persons you have just referred to, Mr. Witness, do you know whether they had any particular nationality? 

THE WITNESS:
That person is Canadian.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Both of them or the last one? 
THE WITNESS:
The last person whose name I mentioned is a Canadian. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	What about Father Vleugls, do you know what nationality he is -- or was? 
A.	He's Belgian. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, when you arrived at the CELA centre, apart from the white priests, were there any other people who were there? 
A.	I met several persons who had come to seek refuge -- and these are people who lived in the CELA neighbourhood and the JOC neighbourhood.  
Q.	And approximately how many people were there when you first arrived? 
A.	It is difficult for me to make an estimate, but obviously there were more than 200 persons.  
Q.	And were those all one sex or were they both men and women?  And, in terms of the ages, were they all -- well, what age range were they? 
A.	It was a mix of persons -- men, women, children, a bit of everything, a mixed group.  
Q.	And did that group all remain at CELA? 
A.	After some time, the priests decided that the women and children should be transferred to Saint Paul, and only the men remain at the CELA centre -- about a hundred of them.  
Q.	Now, when you say "after some time", can you give us indication of whether it was on the 7th, a day later, a week later? 
A.	It was on the 7th, two or three hours after my arrival. 
Q.	And after the women and children left on the afternoon of the 7th, did any more people arrive at CELA during your stay there? 
A.	Yes, people continued arriving, and I left the CELA centre when there were about 500 people there. 
Q.	All right.  Now, did the White Fathers remain living with you all the time you were at CELA? 
A.	The White Fathers continued living at the CELA centre with us and they were evacuated around the 12th, and it was Caucasian troops or soldiers who came to evacuate them. 
Q.	And were you still at CELA when the White Fathers were evacuated? 
A.	I was still at the CELA centre.  
Q.	And was Father Vleugls one of those who left on that date? 
A.	Yes, he was also evacuated on that date.  
Q.	And when he left, did he do or say anything to you? 
A.	At the time he was being evacuated, he, first of all, informed me that he was leaving, and then he handed me the bunch of keys which he had, telling me that we might need them.  
Q.	Do you know why he gave the keys to you? 
A.	There were two of us when he gave me the keys, I don't know why he chose me.  
Q.	And after he left on that date to be evacuated, did you ever hear from him? 
A.	Yes, when he got to his country, he called me on the phone because among -- in the bunch of keys that he gave me, there was one that could open a room in which there was a telephone, so I was able to talk to him on the phone.  
Q.	And what, if anything, did he say to you when he spoke to you? 
A.	He asked me about the situation prevailing in the centre and I gave him an account of the situation.  He then asked me to move documents from his vehicle and keep them in his room.  And he indicated where 600,000 Rwandan francs were -- where he kept 600,000 francs, and told me that we might need them (sic) to buy foodstuffs.  
Q.	Can you give us an indication, if you can remember, how long it was after he had left or been evacuated that he called you at CELA? 
A.	I believe he called me the day after the evacuation.  
Q.	And as a result of him telling you about this money, did you subsequently do anything about that? 
A.	I took 200,000 francs out of the 600,000 -- that is, the money that we found in a box at a place he indicated.  I just took 200,000 francs out of the 600,000. 
(Pages 38 to 55 by Jean Baigent)




















1515H  
BY MR. MOSES 
Q.	Which room was this?  Do you remember? 
A.	The money was in Father Vleugls' room.  
Q.	Now, you say he handed you some keys, did you use any of those keys to open any of the rooms in the CELA centre? 
A.	Yes, I used those keys. 
Q.	Did you see or find anything that you thought might be of use to you as he asked you to use the keys? 
A.	For example, we observed that there was a telephone in their sitting room which enabled us to contact the outside world.  In his room, there was a bed, a small desk, a fax machine, a photocopying machine.  We also discovered a small store room in which there were one or many firearms. 
Q.	When you say 'one or many firearms', do you know how many firearms you found? 
A.	Three guns.  And among the three -- among the three firearms, there were three rifles and one pistol -- sorry, two rifles and one pistol. 
Q.	Do you know what sort of rifles they were? 
A.	These were firearms that looked like hunting guns.  That is the type of guns people used when they go to hunt in the forest. 
Q.	Was there any ammunition for those hunting guns?  
A.	No.  
Q.	And you've said there was another pistol; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And was there any ammunition with the pistol? 
A.	Yes, there were bullets in the pistol. 
Q.	Do you know who these guns belonged to? 
A.	It was obvious that they belonged to the white priest. 
Q.	Why do you say that? 
A.	First of all, the weapons were in the house, and then there were permits for carrying weapons next to the weapons. 
Q.	Did you do anything with the guns you've described as hunting rifles?  Did you do anything with it? 
A.	No. 
Q.	And what about the pistol? 
A.	To tell the truth, we did nothing with that pistol, but I can tell you that I moved it from where it was and I took it with me. 
Q.	When you say, "to tell you the truth, I did nothing with the pistol", was the pistol ever fired during the time you were at CELA centre? 
A.	No, no one fired a shot with that pistol. 
Q.	All right.  Now after the white fathers had left CELA, did any -- were there any priest who came over at CELA? 
A.	After the departure of the white Fathers, Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka came to the centre. 
Q.	Who was he? 
A.	He was a priest from the Saint Famille Parish, a priest, who looked young.  He was a very emblematic personality of the parish before the authorities and the other persons.  That is what I can say about this priest.  He came to the centre on three occasions.  And during the war, he used to move around with the Interahamwe.   We used to see him often with the Interahamwe.
Q.	Had you ever seen him prior to the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	Yes, I used to see him because I used to go to -- I used to attend mass at the Saint Famille (inaudible), so I used to see him. 
Q.	And you said you saw him on three occasions.  Can you describe the circumstances of the first visit - or, first occasion that you saw Wenceslas? 
A.	On the first occasion, I did not see him because he came at night.  He came through an opening or a back door and those who were at that place did not allow him entry into the centre.  He was in the company of three persons.  But I did not see him, I only heard his voice.  They prevented him from entering the centre because it was at night.  So on that occasion he was unable to enter the centre.  
Q.	Was this before or after the white priest had left? 
A.	It was after the departure of the white priest. 
Q.	What about the second occasion, did you see him that time? 
A.	On the second occasion, I saw him.  He came through the same opening, but on this occasion during the day.  So he was allowed in.  He moved towards where we were standing.  He asked for my name.  It was obvious that he did not know me.  We told him.  He was not present in the centre and I saw him on that occasion. 
Q.	Was he alone on that occasion or with other people - persons or other people? 
A.	He was not alone; he was in the company of another person.  It was, subsequently, that we got to know the person who was with him. 
Q.	When was it that you subsequently got to know the other person? 
A.	We saw the same person when the attack that got people out of the CELA centre took place, and that confirmed to us that he was an Interahamwe because on that occasion, the person in question was carrying a weapon. 
Q.	And the third occasion that you saw Wenceslas, what happened, if anything, on that occasion? 
A.	On the third occasion, Wenceslas came during the day.  He entered the centre.  He asked me to open the Father's room for him saying that he had a discussion with Vleugls, who told him to take the money and the priest's vehicle documents.  I opened the door in the company of one Gisagara.  We opened the rooms for which we had the keys.  We realised that Father Wenceslas did not have a lot of information, for example, he could not locate where the money was, whereas the money was in the same place.  He was not able to -- he couldn't find the keys of the vehicle.  We realised he was just inspecting -- looking around.  And he said he was going to take the photocopying machine and the fax machine.
MR. MOSES:  
There has been reference, I think, to Gisagara, and that is number 70.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Did you say number 17?  
MR. MOSES: 
Sorry, 70, seven, zero.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Very good.  Thank you.  
BY MR. MOSES:  
Q.	Witness, apart from the pistol that you told us about having located, were any other persons at the CELA centre armed, specifically with any firearms? 
A.	No one else had firearms at the CELA centre.  There were stones, sharpened sticks and a bow. 
Q.	All right.  Now, earlier in your testimony you said that there were around 500 people, I think, at the time you left.  Is there any reason as to why you would know how many people there were at the CELA centre at that time? 
A.	There is a reason which enabled me to know that number.  We organised ourselves and recorded the names of the persons who were at the centre and those who were coming.  So we knew the number of persons.  I had a list -- with the list of persons who were at the centre before we left that place. 
Q.	Why did you make that list? 
A.	Among the refugees in the CELA, there was one person who worked with the human rights organisation and he was the one who advised that we make the list of those who were staying there and that was what we did. 
Q.	Now how -- when did you leave the CELA centre?  Do you remember the approximate date? 
A.	I believe I left CELA around the 20th. 
Q.	And on that date, what -- did anything special or unusual happen? 
A.	On that date, there was an important attack that was launched against the centre, and amongst the group of attackers, there were soldiers, Interahamwe, as well as many inhabitants.  There were more than 600 attackers and I believe that it was on that day that the préfet of PVK came to the centre. 
Q.	All right.  Well, we will come to that.  What was the first indication that you learnt that there was a problem at CELA that day? 
A.	I was in the living room of the fathers, and if my memory serves me well, I had gone to pick up the telephone and somebody came to tell me that an attack had just been launched against the centre, an important attack.  
Q.	And when you received that information, what, if anything, did you do? 
A.	I asked some questions to those who had just informed me in order to see whether we could try to prevent this attack, but it was not possible because there were many more attackers compared to us.  I threw the weapon I had in the room and I looked for a place of hiding and I went to hide in the chapel. 
Q.	And did you remain -- stay hiding in the chapel for very long? 
A.	I did not stay in the chapel for very long.  After a while, my name was being called throughout the centre and I had to go out of the chapel to see who was calling me. 
Q.	And did you find out who it was -- who was calling your name? 
A.	The person who came to see me told me that Préfet Renzaho was the one looking for me and when I came out I noticed that it was, indeed, him.  He did not introduce himself.  I already knew.  I had already seen him during meetings or on television.
MR. PRESIDENT:  
And what is the date now, Mr. Witness?
THE WITNESS:  
Unless I am mistaken, I believe it was on the 22nd, but I am not quite sure about the date.  It was during the period from the 20th to the 22nd.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
And will you state the month for the record as well?
THE WITNESS:  
It was during the month of April.  
BY MR. MOSES:  
Q.	Approximately what time of day was it? 
A.	It was before noon, around 11:00.  
Q.	When you say you went -- and you went out and saw Renzaho, where were you when you actually saw the préfet? 
A.	I went to join him where he was standing and he was at the main entrance of CELA.  That is where he was in the company of other people. 
Q.	Did he say anything to you? 
A.	He asked me to introduce myself and he asked me why I was in that centre, and also asked what relationship I had with the priest.  I answered him and he also asked me why we were hiding the Inyenzi/Inkotanyi in the centre, and I told him that that was not true.  In fact, he asked me to explain to him why the people who were at the centre had fled their homes.  In the meantime, there were Interahamwe shouting and pushing me around and saying that I was lying.  I tried to tell the truth to him, and I even gave him the list of refugees who were at the centre, and I explained to him that all the refugees were inhabitants of the neighbourhoods.  And I also told him that these people had identity cards that we had seen -- the IDs.  So that was the conversation I had with Mr. Renzaho. 
Q.	You have said that there were people you described as Interahamwe, who were pushing you around and saying things.  Did the préfet say or do anything in respect of the Interahamwe who were present? 
A.	When I arrived, the préfet was telling them not to attack the refugees immediately.  And I remember that he told them not to help the enemy.  He was telling them that everything that was being done was being observed by the satellites and that as a consequence had to act in an intelligent manner.  He gave instructions to them and he told them to choose amongst the refugees the ring leaders.  That was the word he used.  And he said that the ring leaders were to be taken to the Muhima Brigade and be tried before a military court.  But, in fact, he was not doing that because he wished to save those who were staying at the centre. 
Q.	After you had -- I am sorry, you mentioned giving a list to Renzaho.  Do you know what he did with that list? 
A.	I do not know if he could give the list back to me.  I would be quite happy.  I do not know what he did with the list I gave him. 
Q.	All right.  Now, after you had finished this conversation with the préfet, what happened to you? 
A.	He handed me over to a soldier who was there and asked him to take me further down, and the soldier told me that they had heard that we had dug trenches in the centre, and that he would check and if that were true, he would kill me immediately.  It was in the back courtyard of CELA next to the fence.  We went there; he did not find the trenches, and we came back together.  And we went next to another block of buildings and we found there people who had been asked to kneel.  That soldier did not seem a very -- evil to me, except for what he said.  That is to say that he would kill me.  I tried to bribe him, if I may say so, and I told him that if he could save me I would give him money.  A few minutes later, he asked me to stand up and we left using the same path. 
Q.	I just want to take you back briefly.  You said that you left the position with a soldier, the position where you had met Renzaho.  Was he the only soldier you saw there? 
A.	There were other soldiers.  
Q.	And you've described how this soldier took you down behind CELA to look for trenches.  Now, approximately, how long did that take for the soldier to look around the rear of CELA with you? 
A.	I would say around 15 minutes.  I did not look at my watch, but I believe it was around 15 minutes. 
Q.	Now you told us also that after that, you came and you saw some people who were kneeling.  Now, approximately, can you remember how many people were there at that time? 
A.	Around 20 people.  
Q.	And what if anything did the soldier make you do when you arrived and saw that group of around 
	20 people kneeling? 
A.	He also asked me to kneel with the others, and that is what I did. 
Q.	And, approximately, how long were you kneeling there for at that time? 
A.	I did not stay there for long.  I would say around three to five minutes.  And, subsequently, the soldier called me back. 
Q.	And during those three to five minutes, did the number of people who were kneeling at the rear remain the same? 
A.	Other people joined that group of people who were kneeling. 
Q.	And do you know where they were being -- where those persons came from? 
A.	At CELA, there are different buildings and people had been grouped next to the blocks of buildings.  And those who were asked to kneel were selected among those refugees. 
Q.	Could you see that large -- well, that other group of refugees from where you were kneeling? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, you have told us that from your knowledge, you thought that there were around 500 refugees at CELA at that time.  At the time that you were kneeling at the rear there, were other persons inside the CELA compound apart from refugees? 
A.	There were also attackers; those who had launched the attack. 
Q.	Are you able to give any indication as to the number of attackers who were inside the CELA grounds using perhaps the number of refugees as some sort of reference?  Were there more attackers inside CELA or less? 
A.	There were more assailants than there were refugees.  I would say that there were more than 600 attackers. 
Q.	All right.  Now you told us earlier that it was -- you were kneeling for about three to five minutes before the soldier called you.  What, if anything, did he say to you? 
A.	He did not say anything to me on the spot.  He told me, "walk", and we left, and he asked me where he could take me, and I told him to take me to the Saint Paul centre. 
Q.	Did you get to the Saint Paul centre? 
A.	We were not able to reach the Saint Paul centre because at a distance of around 50 metres from CELA on the tarred road, we met a group of women among which was Rose Lwanga, and I asked them where they were heading, and they told me that they had been ordered to go back home, and I told them not to go back home because it was a lie.  And, I believe, the other attackers noticed that I was with that soldier, so they called us and I was asked to go -- or, rather, I was asked to join the group of refugees.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Mr. Witness, you met Mr. Renzaho -- or, at least you first saw him at 11 o' clock, on probably the 
22nd of April.  Is that the evidence?
THE WITNESS:  
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Then you had a conversation with him, and you have given us a summary of that conversation.  Then you left and, at some stage, looked at the trenches and then we had the kneeling, and then you left and met the group of women.  What time is it when you were meeting the group of women, approximately?  
THE WITNESS:  
Mr. President, I would be hard pressed to give you an exact time, but I would say that it was around 
30 minutes subsequently.  So I would say that I met the ladies around noon.  

MR. PRESIDENT:   
So the whole sequence we have just heard you describe actually took place in a limited period of time, within half an hour to an hour.  So it is now around noon; is that so?  
THE WITNESS:  
Yes, Mr. President.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	In your previous answer, you had said that you had asked the women where they were hiding and they told you that they had been ordered to go back home, and I told them not to go back home because it was a lie.  Now, can you help the Trial Chamber understand what "was a lie"?  
A.	I told them that this was a lie because it was a way of killing them in their own homes.  That is what I meant. 
Q.	Had the women told you why they were going back home? 
A.	They told me that they had just been requested to go back home; that there was nothing they should fear, and that the killing should cease. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, you said that you also said later in that answer that you were called and asked to go and join the group of refugees.  Do you remember saying that? 
A.	I am sorry, Mr. Prosecutor, but I did not quite understand your question. 
Q.	After you had met the women, what, if anything, did you do?  After you had had this conversation, what did you do or where did you go? 
A.	I was asked to join the other refugees and I went to join the group of people who were kneeling, so I also knelt. 
Q.	And who asked you to do that? 
A.	I do not know who exactly.  Someone called that soldier and asked him where I was going, and it was that same soldier who brought me back towards the group of people who were kneeling. 
Q.	And on this -- the second occasion, how long did you spend kneeling? 
A.	I would say around one hour on the second occasion.  I knelt for around one hour.  
MR. MOSES:  
Your Honours, I think at this stage, can we go into a closed session because there is information which I will now be leading, which, bearing in mind earlier testimonies, I think could lead to the identity of this witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Yes, and this is the final portion of the testimony?  So we will not go back again.  
MR. MOSES:  
We can probably come back into open session for a few minutes at the end of the testimony.  There is an incident which he is now going to recount.  Where he goes after that incident can be done in open session.  

MR. PRESIDENT:  
And you find it difficult now to address that open session testimony right away?  It's easier for you to follow the chronology?  
MR. MOSES:  
I think it would be easier for everyone, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
All right.  We will then have to move into closed session.  For approximately how long?  
MR. MOSES:  
Perhaps 20 minutes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
All right.  If those in the public gallery could kindly leave us for that period, that would be appreciated.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 64 to 74] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera))

MR. PRESIDENT: 
So Witness UI, we are now in open session to conclude your examination-in-chief.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, you said -- you've told us that you went to the Saint Paul's centre.  Who was in charge of the Saint Paul's centre?  
A.	It was Father Jeff Vleugls who was in charge of the centre. 
Q.	I'm talking about the Saint Paul's centre, when you arrived there.  
A.	I'm sorry, I made a mistake.  It was Father Célestin Hakizimana who was in charge of the Saint Paul centre. 
Q.	And how were you treated when you arrived at the Saint Paul's centre?  
A.	When I arrived, I was welcomed by Father Célestin who gave me a room and asked me to stay inside the room.  In a few words, I was well treated.  
Q.	And how long did you remain at the Saint Paul's centre for?  
A.	I stayed there from April, and up until the 16th or 17th.  That is to say, until the 16th of June.  
Q.	Under what circumstances did you leave Saint Paul's? 
A.	I left the centre when the Inkotanyi launched an attack against it and evacuated almost all the people who were at the Saint Paul centre.  
Q.	And did anything happen to you as you were -- or, as you'd left the Saint Paul's centre on that day?  
A.	I can mention one specific incident when we were crossing towards Kacyiru, I was shot in the knee.  
Q.	Were you with anyone at the time?  
A.	I was with a number of other people.  I was holding one of my children in my arms and there were three other people with us.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, you told us earlier that the conseiller of your secteur was a woman, Odette Nyirabagenzi.  Did you ever see that person whilst you were at the Saint Paul's centre?  
A.	I saw her, but in special circumstances, if I may use that expression.  I saw her when I was peeping to look outside.  I was looking through curtains of a window.  
Q.	When was this in relation to the day that you were taken -- or, the day that you left the Saint Paul's centre?  
A.	The last time I saw her was on the 14th of June.  
Q.	And what, if anything, was happening on the 14th of June?  
A.	That was the day when the young men who were at the Saint Paul centre, some 50-odd young men, were abducted and were led to their death.  She was with Interahamwe and had a list in her hands.  So that is the specific incident I can mention.  
Q.	And during that incident where the young men were led to their deaths, were you -- did you stay inside, or did you ever go outside your room?  
A.	I stayed in the room. 

MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, I think that concludes the evidence-in-chief, if this is an appropriate time.  

There's one administrative matter before we conclude, that -- I've just received a note to say that my learned friend, Ms. Melluish, is in the safe house.  AWO needs, or wants -- needs some medical treatment.  She may not be able to testify tomorrow, and may -- there may be a need for a change of order.  So if I can just place that on record and advise my learned friends that there -- of the three remaining witnesses, it may be that we alter the order in which they testify.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you mentioned originally that AWO would testify before these three, in order to facilitate the task of everyone, these three rape victims.  What will be the order of these three?  Their pseudonyms, please?  
MR. MOSES: 
The three pseudonyms are AWO, KBZ, and AWX.  Those were -- that was the original order.  So if there is a change, I would imagine that the first witness after this witness will be KBZ, followed by perhaps AWX, and then finishing with AWO.  Those are the only three witnesses remaining after this one.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay, all right.  That's noted.  

Mr. Witness, we will start your cross-examination tomorrow morning at 8:45.  Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  

The Court is adjourned.  
(Court adjourned at 1702H)
