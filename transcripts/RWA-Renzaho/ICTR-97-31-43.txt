P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, the Court is in session.  

Good morning, Mr. Renzaho. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before we continue your cross-examination -- your examination-in-chief today, I need your assistance in connection with a few loose ends.  So, will you please help me in answering a few very precise questions very briefly.  It's mostly about spelling and making sure that we get the record right.  

The first question is you referred yesterday to the fact that there was a refugee camp as Nyachionga (phonetic).  Now after that word you said something that sounds like Lusanaire; could you help us with that word please, the spelling?  
THE WITNESS:
With pleasure, Mr. President, Rusine is spelt R-U-S-I-N-E, Rusine.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  Then in connection with Saint Andre school you said that that was behind a parish.  And that sounded like "Shalwanga".  Can you help us with the spelling, please?  
THE WITNESS:
Charles is spelt C-H-A-R-L-E-S, Rwanga (sic), R-W-A-N-G-A (sic). 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We have heard that before.  Now, remember -- Mr. Moses?  
MR. MOSES: 
In the English it come back as R-W-A-N-G-A, I thought the witness said "L". 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It is with "L", isn't it, Mr. Renzaho?  
THE WITNESS:
I said "L".  In fact the name comes from an Ugandan martyr whose name was Lwanga. 
MR. CANTIER: 
And it is number 261 on our list. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.

Then we moved on to Saint Paul and Sainte Famille, and you told us that you were with the gendarmes staying near the garage.  You invited some of the refugees because you did not wait for everybody to be present.  You didn't know the exact number.  

And then you continued: "So they came and I asked" -- and the name following sounds like Lakisana 
"to communicate the measure to them."  What was the name, please?  
THE WITNESS:
I remember the context, but as to the name "Lakisana". 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No one remembers?  Then we leave it at that.  It is probably not so important.  

You then referred to a book called "Rwanda:  A Land of Peace to a Land of Blood, and What After?"  That is written by an author named Valens, V-A-L-E-N-S.  Can you please help us with the last name?  
THE WITNESS:
That's correct, Mr. President, his surname is Kageguhakwa, K-A-G-E-G-U-H-A-K-W-A. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  Then you referred to people having taken refuge in Saint Paul, and principally at the primary school where there were Hutus from "Kabugucasos"; what was that name, please?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I referred to the locality of Kagugu and Gisozi, K-A-G-U-G-U and G-I-S-O-Z-I. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, the refugees came from two different places, that's the point, is that so?  
THE WITNESS:
These are two neighbouring secteurs, one prolongs the other. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Charles Lwanga, is that in Nyamirambo?  
THE WITNESS:
That is correct, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That was very helpful.  Thank you very much indeed.  We were a bit busy yesterday with all the evidence we needed to get on the record.  Now it's all clear.  

Maître Cantier, yesterday you wanted to tender the passport of Mr. Bagasora.  There was an objection.  We have deliberated and we will overrule the objection and allow the document.  Your observations will go to weight.  

What is your first question this morning, Maître Cantier?  

THARCISSE RENZAHO,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, two Prosecution witnesses, AFB and BOU, came to testify that in two separate locations on two different dates, the 7th and 21st of April, you had distributed weapons.  What do you say in the face of these two charges? 
A.	My answer is that I did not distribute any weapons on the 7th.  I told the Trial Chamber all the activities I had carried out on that day.  But I also heard, just as you did, what Witness AFB stated before this 
	Trial Chamber.  That situation he depicted is contrary to the schedule I had on that day.  Let me add that his statement is made up of a number of statements that are totally unrealistic.  

Let me be more explicit, I did not know that person.  On the 7th at 6:45 he alleges that he was requisitioned by two policemen, in order to follow an order I had given to the conseilller of that secteur, to summon him; that person being CUB.  In order to commandeer both the driver and his vehicle and take them to the préfecture, that was not possible.  

On that date, that is to say on the 7th at 11 in the morning, the same witness stated that I went to fetch weapons at the Hôtel des Diplomates and, according to him, the weapons and the ammunition were given to me by General Kabiligi.  

At 11 on the 7th I was attending a meeting at the senior military school.  There are documents that prove that fact, and I am stating that this is the truth.  

Let me add one element, if the weapons could have been given to me by General Kabiligi on the 7th; on the 7th he was not in Rwanda.  These are facts that can be verified.  This allegation, to my mind -- or perhaps a mistake was made, but this allegation is unfounded.  It is not true.  It is not realistic.  

Now as regards the date, I do not wish to react to all the statements made by that witness, because according to him I went around town to control roadblocks, distribute weapons and congratulate people who were manning the roadblocks, and so on and so forth.  Let me tell you in full conscience all this is a figment of his imagination and do not correspond to any fact that actually occurred.  I did not have the time to do these things and I was not there.  

I do not wish to insist on the allegation in his statement regarding the date of the 10th where I allegedly attended a meeting at Mr. Protais Zigiranyirazo's house where politicians and the leaders of Interahamwe were allegedly attending.  Once again, this is a figment of his imagination.  On the 10th I had a specific programme, which I mentioned here.  On the 10th I did not see -- and I do not even know where Mr. Protais Zigiranyirazo's house was.  I never set foot in his house, and that is the truth.  

Now as regards the other persons he has referred to, I read somewhere in the Radio Rwanda documents that on that same date and at the same time Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, along with other political leaders, was holding a meeting following which they gave a press conference at the 
Hôtel des Diplomates.  I was not there.  And the Hôtel des Diplomates is not Mr. Protais' house.  

So you understand that there are basic contradictions in his statement. 
Q.	On the 21st of April, Mr. Renzaho, and on the essential matter of weapons, according to Witness BUO -- 
A.	On the 21st of April I was allegedly taken in the vehicle by Colonel Munyakazi, in a vehicle which was supposedly provided by the Presidential Guard and was a pickup, in which there was allegedly weapons and ammunition as well as a detachment of gendarmes for our protection.  And we allegedly went to Mrs. Mukandituye's place of residence around 8, if my memory serves me right.  

I wish to tell the Trial Chamber that to ask Colonel Munyakazi to come and fetch me at the préfecture, one would first have to assume that that person had any link whatsoever with me, and that before the 6th April of 1994 someone would have seen him.  And especially from the 6th of April 1994, someone would have seen him come and visit me and speak with me at the préfecture of Kigali town.  I cannot imagine how that person could have come to fetch me when I tried to have him collaborate with me and I was not successful.  

I gave you the example of the 22nd of April, and it was a specific case where his men in the field were asking for his intervention.  I spoke to him personally on the telephone and he refused to intervene in the field.  How could he have been kind enough to come and fetch me on the 21st?  There was an attack that did not take place.  

You heard UI, being the pseudonym of that person, who stated he was the leader of the refugees who were at CELA.  And he linked the fact that there was an incident on the 21st of April 1994 at CELA, or rather denied that such an incident took place.  There was no incident.  

Since the statement of that person was referred to, I wish to tell you that Colonel Munyakazi's behaviour, his habits, in that he did not come to see me at the préfecture.  He never colloborated with me.  He was never seen at the préfecture.  So it would be quite surprising that he might have had the intuition on the 21st to come and fetch me in order to organise this matter.  But it would have been surprising that we could have discussed such a matter and then gone about our business.  

Where did the weapons come from?  Did they come from the préfecture?  And what about the pickup from the president's office?  I don't know. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, you're repeating your case.  But I believe this is not a fitting time to do so.  Please tell the Trial Chamber, or answer the question that was put to you, which was to know whether you had gone to CELA on the 21st of April 1994 in the company of the persons who were mentioned by Witness BUO.  Please answer by yes or no, please.  
A.	My answer is no.  And let me add something, Mr. Byrumbagara (phonetic), who has been referred to in the allegation, had not yet been called upon.  Thank you. 
Q.	Yes, Mr. Renzaho, did you have a close and regular co-operation with the ICRC throughout the events?  You have had the opportunity to deal with that matter previously for ad hoc actions that -- I'm putting to you a broader question on your collaboration with the ICRC.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Yes, I did my best in order to co-operate with the ICRC and I was quite proud, as I stated several times; I was quite proud of the work carried out by the ICRC.  Their work was irreplaceable.  I did not co-operate with the ICRC. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I wish to have shown to you a document which is in the Prosecution file, Exhibit P. 33, dated 29th of April -- interoffice memorandum. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. Renzaho said:  "This is item 5" -- or rather:  "Point 5 of this document". 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you have P. 33 or P. 35?  
MR. CANTIER: 
P. 33, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You have that in front of you.  Now which portion should we look at?  
MR. CANTIER:
Item 5 of the said document, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Have you found it, Mr. Renzaho?
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, Mr. President.
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	So, Mr. Renzaho, this document, which we only have in English, in its English version, what comment can you make on item 5 which to summarise states that your collaboration with the ICRC was excellent?  And at the same time, you were not in a capacity to control the actions of the militias, if my translation is correct.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  The truth of the matter is that the situation was beyond control for a number of factors which we tried to mention here.  But it was still necessary, in spite of the chaos and the anarchy, to save human lives.  So the ICRC was doing its best in order to try and save these lives.  
And I do know that we experienced difficulties with the ICRC in previous incidents, and it is probably what is being mentioned here.  The ICRC representative expressed his concerns on the situation, that is true.  His teams were tempered in their activities in the field.  It was not the first time, it was not the second time.  Every single time we were able to intervene in the field, we did so.  And what he is saying here is true.  I thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please remember the speed, Mr. Renzaho, it is a bit too fast now. 
THE WITNESS:
I shall make an effort, Mr. President. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, did you know Colonel Yaache, Y-A-A-C-H-E? 
A.	Counsel, I do not know this individual. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, did you know Major MacNeil, M-A-C-N-E-I-L? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I did not personally meet that person.  I did not speak to him face to face.  But during the incident of the 3rd of May I got to hear of him because from what I was told he was the person in charge of the preparation of the refugee evacuation operation.  The refugees were to leave the Mille Collines hotel to go to the RPF controlled area.  But apart from that information I got, I never met that person and I never spoke to him. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, under such circumstances, how can you explain the content of Exhibit P. 29, which is in the Prosecution file and which refers to a meeting you allegedly held with Colonel Yaache and 
	Major MacNeil on the 28th of April of 1994?  
MR. CANTIER:
That is to say, Mr. President, Your Honours, that this document is dated 28 of April 1994, that is to say, the day before the meeting mentioned in the document I just dealt with, took place; that is to say P. 33 dated 29th of April 1994.  
THE WITNESS:
	Counsel, I wish to answer your question.  I do not recall having held any meeting with these 
	two individuals, and I don't even know where such a meeting could have taken place.  Was it in my office?  I never held a meeting in my office with the UNAMIR staff.  I did attend meetings organised by General Dallaire, usually at the Hôtel des Diplomates.  And I was not the only person attending, I was usually with other officials, namely, army officials and members of the gendarmerie.  

Now as regards the content of this document, it is a report that was produced by the UNAMIR services.  This report is referring to the events we were in the midst of; that is to say, the difficulties encountered by the UNAMIR teams because of the chaos that was reigning throughout the city because of the inflows of populations and the extremely negative atmosphere prevailing at the time.  
And perhaps this was meant -- or perhaps this is an indication of the reason why I referred a number of times to the situation where people were to understand that they had to give priority to actions aimed at providing assistance to those who needed that assistance, because it was chaos, people did as they pleased.  

My concern -- it was my concern to do my utmost to prevent the departure of the ICRC, because the ICRC provided us with everything.  It was the ICRC that provided assistance to the thousands of refugees.  They provided foodstuffs,  they provided drugs.  They also assisted in the transportation of the injured.  And let me tell you that in light of what was done elsewhere, it was during that period that the ICRC even accepted to provide fuel.  It did not only provide its services, it also provided fuel because there was a shortage of fuel.  

So, tell me what I could have done in order to forget that if the ICRC services, or the ICRC was to leave, the situation would become untenable.  Perhaps some empty promises were made in order to reassure our partners for them to remain on the site.  I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But Maître Cantier's question is:  How you can explain this document?  This is a document written by a UN officer stating that you, the préfet of Kigali, had a meeting with Colonel Yaache and Major MacNeil.  You were a prominent person.  Everyone must have known you.  Would they invent this?  Could there be a mixture of personalities?  How do you explain a written document saying that you did meet them between 1130 and 1400 hours?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, unfortunately, the only thing I can say is that Renzaho is myself.  It is me, Renzaho.  There is no other Renzaho.  But I am not aware of that meeting.  I did not participate in that meeting.  
If there was a document, a meeting always involves more than one person, and I had people who were involved in the field.  

I cannot imagine how I could have gone alone to a meeting dealing with humanitarian matters, when I had a deputy who was specifically entrusted with that task, who is not even referred to here, and he himself stated before this Trial Chamber that he did not participate in that meeting.  

So I believe it is an internal memorandum that was conveyed to his superiors by an officer and this was a person who was in charge of humanitarian matters.  What I mean is that he would go and visit the centres sheltering refugees and would refer to problems occurring there.  I did not participate in such a meeting when I had staff that was especially entrusted with such tasks on a daily basis.  

I did not attend this meeting.  Perhaps my memory is failing me, but I do not see myself participating in that meeting.  Thank you. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, if I recall the discussions we had yesterday correctly, a Prosecution document which has been used on several occasions, and a document which is not signed, at least with the copy I have, in order to comply with the rules of procedure, would have required that the Prosecution call 
Colonel Yaache to testify and perhaps also Major MacNeil.  

This is merely an observation and I will come back to the matter subsequently. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, on a matter which was of great interest to the Trial Chamber, and which was important to all of us.  Do you know or did you know the bourgmestre of Bicumbi? 
A.	No, I did not know him.  I did not know the new bourgmestre, I knew the previous one. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Renzaho, I'm sorry, but I was not aware there was any change.  I am referring to the bourgmestre who was there during the period which is of interest to us, that is to say, between the 
	6th April and July of 1994? 
A.	I did not know him. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, did you call the place where this bourgmestre had his office during the events? 
A.	Counsel, I never phoned that location for any reason whatsoever.  I don't see why I would have. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I am in fact referring quite clearly to the matter of the tape.  Did you recognise your voice when the tape was heard by the Trial Chamber on several occasions?  Please answer simply by yes or no.  
A.	No. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, when those events occurred from 7 April 1994, were you aware that a genocide was in the making? 
A.	Thank you for that question.  Counsel, I must tell you that the events that broke out in the night of 6 to 7 were not isolated.  There was a succession of terrible events before that event.  And, frankly, I don't know whether there is anybody who could have thought that the incident that happened on that night could lead to the outcome that we knew in Rwanda.  I had no idea.  

And I've always had the hope, day in day out, that the country could break out of that situation.  However, things went on as if fate was really against us, and all the factors that could serve as a source of hope simply disappeared one after the other.  And from the 6th or the 7th who could have imagined that such an outcome would happen in Rwanda?  I don't know.  Or maybe, and this is an unverified assumption, unless on the 6th I had knowledge of any kind of plan for genocide in Rwanda, but I didn't.  Thank you. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, could you describe the events that happened during that period, April to July, today as genocide against the Tutsis? 
A.	Counsel, I would like to say that I am neither qualified nor in a position to describe what happened in Rwanda as genocide.  I believe that is the mission of this Tribunal, and that of history too.  And I hope history will do its work.  Thank you. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, when did you learn of the massacres committed by the RPF on the Hutu population? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I realise that widespread massacres have been committed by the RPF on the Hutu population; first, with the arrival of this population from the rural areas of the Kigali city préfecture; then as from the 8th, and later on the thousands of displaced persons and war refugees from Nyacyongo.  And, as I said, there were two camps of war-displaced persons who were separated by distance of two and a half kilometres, and this was confirmed to me.  

With the arrival at the préfecture of the bourgmestre of Muhazi commune was a lot of persons.  And he is the one who narrated all what happened to me since he had witnessed it.  He had passed through all the Bicumbi communes, and communes that were neighbouring to Kigali, since we took him in.  And he told us all what he had seen.  

He even granted an interview to the press.  And I believe that interview should be in the records of the Tribunal.  I had that confirmation from others and other eyewitnesses.  Thank you. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, can you tell the Chamber the date on which you met this person, the person you say witnessed these events? 
A.	I received that person on the 25th or 26th of April 1994, and he took a lot of time to cross the entire area that was occupied by RPF troops. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, were you aware of a report from the office of the high commissioner for refugees dated 10 October 1994? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, I read that report. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I'm looking through my papers, a bit untidy, to find the document we have disclosed.  The document is only in English -- there's only an English version.  

Mr. President, we're getting to it.  Sorry, it is 1, I think, of 19.  Yes, the first folder, number 1 of 19.  And the document that is of special interest, or the part that is of special interest in that report to us is 
page 4, page 4 of the report, since it has been written, the report used with the préfecture of Kigali. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, what can you tell us, especially about the second paragraph of that document, that speaks of massacres during the meetings -- of massacres of families during meetings, that were actually traps set by the APR to massacre the civilian population? 
A.	The reference is R002911 -- R11.  

Counsel, I agree completely with the information found in this document.  And I, personally, had occasion to hear witnesses who escaped from such operations in the course of the year 1996.  

Let's begin with Kigali as you want.  True, I was responsible for Kigali.  In the night to 6 to 7 April 1994 there were killings in Kigali.  Senior officials of the administration and the army were killed in the city of Kigali.  

I would not bother you with all the names, in fact I would not be able to cite all of them.  But bear in mind that at least some reports of some witnesses say that 280 persons were killed that night.  The war did the rest.  But to come back precisely to the issue here, any region that was overrun was combed entirely right down to the valleys, the banana plantations, everywhere.  The hunting was done in the traditional way.  

And this was told to me by my maternal aunt -- my paternal aunt, sorry, that I meant there, that I met in May 1995.  She had spent barely one month in that camp.  It meant that from April 1994 to March 1995 she lived in her own region hiding, and she watched these organised manhunts and she had nowhere to hide, so she fled.  This is what she told me and this was confirmed to me by other persons.  

The pacification meetings, as they were called, were entered assembling the population.  As long as the inhabitants were not numerous, they had to build confidence within the population and give them essential commodities, which was salt, sugar and soap.  And they had to go and look for other persons, maybe on the pretext that new identity cards were going to be distributed, or that people were going to get organised to prevent Interahamwe incursions.  

And when the number of the people swelled, they were surrounded and gunned down, they were killed.  And that is what happened in the eastern region of Rwanda.  In my own préfecture of origin, where I can't see any of my neighbours, all those old men who taught me or saw me when I was born, I don't see them.  And I had confirmation that they were liquidated.  Thank you. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, on what basis were these massacres committed? 
A.	Well, basis or criteria -- the truth is that the Hutus who were there were the ones concerned.  The strategy consisted in assembling people who were found in parties other than the MRND and others, because they knew troops accused those parties of having fought against the RPF.  

So they recruited people from the other parties and they gave them crash training and gave them weapons, and so they swelled the ranks of the RPF troops, because to overcome the entire country was a huge task.  So they had to involve the local population.  So they were hunting down the population everywhere and they went into hiding and then those who participated in that operation were assembled and gunned down.  
So that is the truth I wanted to tell you.  It is something I heard with my own ears from people who experienced that situation, people I met in the camps.  And to corroborate what is written in this report, others such as myself were able to observe that situation and write on them.  Thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, what were your personal plans in mid-1993 and early 1994? 
A.	Counsel, the proverb goes that "Man proposes but God disposes".  But as far as I was concerned, there was no difference to me.  

True, at the end of 1993 I expressed the wish to my superiors that I wanted to be relieved of the post in which I found myself and I wanted to return to the army.  Maybe not to stay there, but shortly thereafter to leave the army and devote myself to my family.  And later on carry out activities that could have maintained my family.  I think I had occasion to mention it here.  We had -- we agreed to do it together because not only did I waste my time but I took away a lot of time from my family.  Thank you. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, when you mentioned these plans, do you recall the document from the ministry of defence dated 13 December 1993? 
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, it is the first volume, 1, tab 8. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Counsel, I am aware of that document.  And it came after a letter that I wrote.  Unfortunately, I can't lay my hands on that letter. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Renzaho, so this document, the document I have cited, it's a three-page document, and it's found only in the French.  Sorry, the document has four pages and it is page 3 that is of interest to us.  There is a title on that page entitled: "Observations on the maintenance of officers placed at the disposal of other administrative structures."   And the third name is, "Colonel Renzaho, Tharcisse, is waiting impatiently to be withdrawn."  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, have you found the document?  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	"And with the approval of the ministry of defence. "  It's on the third page, there is the name of 
	Mr. Renzaho and the comments.  And then the opinion of the ministry of defence approved, so he had to be withdrawn from the PVK.  

Mr. Renzaho, it happened that on 6 April 1994, you were still there, how do you explain that with respect to this approval that was given to your application? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  This situation is blamed on the delays in the procedures, because it required that the president of the republic sign an order putting an end to my duties as the préfet of the city of Kigali.  That is all that was remaining.  All the others had been done.  I was summoned to the office of the minister of the interior  and I expressed to him my desire to be discharged -- to be relieved of my duties.  I then showed him a letter I'd written before.  And on that basis he wrote a memo to the minister of the republic asking him to follow through with my application to leave.  

Meanwhile a lot of events had occurred, very disturbing and very serious events, or maybe there were other events that had happened, but I was still waiting for the presidential order to relieve me of my duties, so I could leave.  

So, the events of 6 April actually met me in that situation.  Thank you. 
Q.	Precisely, Mr. Renzaho.  Since we are on the issue:  Why did you stay on in your office, for instance, on 12 April the government set the example by fleeing? 
A.	Thank you, why did I stay on?  I don't know.  There were moments of madness, maybe it was madness because I was tempted to leave.  Then I told myself at some point, and it was my conscience that was prompting me, that if I left with the problems that were there, the people in distress, the people that I was seeing, somehow it would be some kind of betrayal.  

So I accepted, and I told myself I couldn't place my own interest before those of the population, all those people I saw suffering.  Those who were dying; they were human beings.  And I'd never thought that my life would be of a much higher value than those of other persons.  It was a retaliation that had gone under.  

So, where would I flee to?  That was a question I asked myself.  It didn't last for long.  Then I quickly understood that there was something to be done for the population.  All the more so, as with the intensification of fighting, the encircling and the bits of hopes that we nourished, all that did not last for a week.  And on the 12th we had been surrounded.  My friends had left and everything was just drifting.  

There is even an UNAMIR officer who came by and told me: "Mr. Préfet" -- I was used to seeing him.  He was a liaison officer of UNAMIR and he told me:  "You are in trouble.  You should take care of yourself.  Everybody has left.  You are alone here."  

Frankly, I remained for that purpose.  There was no luxury position.  No nice place where I had to sleep.  There was nothing.  I had to experience the misery of my people. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, well, you were not the master, would the solution not have been to surrender? 
A.	Counsel, the issue is a rather broad one, but I would like to tell you something.  First, the capacity to influence decisions of others, the other officials, notably army officials or others, or gendarmerie officials, or political decision makers, it is a fact.  
But I will tell you something, something that may resemble what you mentioned about surrendering.  It was clearly expressed on the 12th in the memo that was signed by the army high command.  So, they proposed to the RPF that there be an immediate ceasefire on the fighting.  Then dialogue set up unified units of the FAR and the APR (sic) to jointly carry out pacification operations.  And there was no greater surrender or capitulation than that one.  And, please, even that one was rejected.  

Everyone wanted complete military victory.  And in the military theory that I learnt, that existed before 1870, as long as people took up arms to liberate the population, the interest of the population came before any other consideration.  And I believe that if political problems are to be settled, victory has -- victory has to be total, then it will end in human disaster.  

That is all I have to say on this issue. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, this is my last question: Do you regret having stayed on? 
A.	Yes, partially.  Counsel, do you recall the Myth of Sysiphus?  
Q.	Yes, I have read Albert Camus.  
A.	That is precisely the impression I had, because in any case the people who have gone back have died, and I did not do the utmost to save the utmost number of people.  I did the best I could, but the disaster still happened.  So I had the misfortune to live throughout this period.  But somehow I tell myself that this life on earth can only have meaning when it is used or placed at the service of other people.  

What would I have gained?  What other substantial thing would I have gained to try -- by trying to go and hide somewhere or sit somewhere and live quietly?  Besides I realise they would not have let me live quietly, knowing that somewhere there were people who were suffering.  

So, my attitude on this issue is ambivalent.  I have a lot of regret for all these people who died for nothing, because it was unnecessary.  Unnecessary in the sense that sooner or later people have to sit together and see what they have in common and do these things together.  That is what I have always called megalomania, vanity.  I don't have enough adjectives to describe it, human folly.  

It is very regrettable because we had the Arusha Accords.  We could have implemented them.  And if they were incomplete, we would have sought to improve them with time.  Problems are created by humans and these problems have to be solved by humans.  So, my attitude is ambivalent.  

I was more or less satisfied, as far as my conscience is concerned, I could do what I was able to.  But I realise that all this did not do much with respect to the disasters.  Could you imagine the people who died?  And over four million of them on the move wandering throughout the country.  Leaving -- people leave Rwanda and get to the Atlantic ocean on foot.  Well, I thank you, Counsel. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I'm through with my examination-in-chief. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much indeed.  That was the end of the examination-in-chief.  

Do you have the list of exhibits available, Defence?  
MR. CANTIER: 
It is ready, Mr. President.  We shall print it on the spot. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
If we could get a copy of that list and then distribute it to everyone in the courtroom, the Prosecution, Chamber.  And once we've got it, we will go through the list and make sure that the formal tendering is being done.  

Cross-examination?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I wish to crave your indulgence and perhaps utter a few words and thank you for having very kindly listened to me.  

But, it is the only opportunity I was given to express myself.  And, if I may, I wish to crave your indulgence for any errors I might have made here, which I'd also like to seize this opportunity for also having listened to me, because I had many things on my conscious that I would have liked to have expressed.  And if I was able to say or to talk about my feelings, it is a good thing.  

I deeply regret all the misfortune that befell Rwanda and I believe that any experience is to the benefit of mankind.  It makes it grow in wisdom and enables it to prevent such events taking place in the future.  So this is my message to you, a message of gratitude and of encouragement in the fulfilment of the noble task that was entrusted to you.  

And I do hope that your Trial Chamber and this institution will be able to establish actions which will be of use to the Rwandan people.  I thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

Mr. Moses.  
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honours.  Before I commence my questioning just a few brief introductory matters, and I'll ask for a bundle of some documents to be passed out amongst Your Honours and my learned friend.  

Also, if I can indicate at this stage that the Prosecution, at some effort at the beginning of the trial, provided to all the interpreters copies of exactly the bundles of exhibits that Your Honours and we have; apparently some of them are missing.  We certainly don't have the facility to provide again other bundles of documents.  But bearing in mind that the Accused has been speaking in French and I believe all the documents -- or most of them are -- I may be reading from the English.  It might be of advantage for the French booth to have what folders of exhibits do exist so that I can -- if I'm referring to exhibits, they will have them.  

I have also handed out a handwritten document which just sets out for the parties and Your Honours numbers of Prosecution exhibits that I may refer to, whether I go into them in any depth or not will depend on answers given.  But that's just to give everyone an idea where we're heading.  I've given that list also to the registry so that they can hopefully also have some advance warning.  Those are in respect of exhibits that have already been tendered.  

So, that's just an initial comment to Your Honours.  

If I can commence by speaking to the Accused and to say:  
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, you will have seen me operate in this Court over the last few months and you will have seen that from time to time I have interrupted witnesses if I have felt that they are going off track.  Just to indicate at the outset, that I may do the same with you.  If you feel that there are matters, or if your counsel feels there are matters which you have been prevented from explaining in full of course, your lawyer will have the opportunity in re-examination to return to those matters.  

A number of my questions will only require yes or no answers.  It's not to prevent you from giving further explanation if you feel such explanation is necessary, but in order for us to proceed in an efficient manner; if you do feel that an answer can be given with a single word, then it would be my invitation to you to do so.  

All right. 
A.	Your Honour, I wish to ask for a sheet of paper because my memory might fail me in light of all that's being said.  So could I be given a piece of paper just to take a note of a name or any information?  I do need some paper.  Thank you. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
The registry is taking care of that now.  Thank you.
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, at the very outset of your testimony on Monday, in the very first words that you used, you described the events from April to July as "the Rwandan tragedy".  For those of us who have been in this Court for some time it is an expression which is almost exclusively used by genocide deniers.  

Now, we have asked -- your Counsel has asked you about whether you accept there was a genocide; is it fair to say that your position is that you do not accept that there was a genocide of the Tutsi in Rwanda from April to July 1994? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution.  I gave my answer on the question.  The institution in a position to do so is the Tribunal and I shall bow to the decision of the Tribunal. 
(Pages 1 to 16 by Melissa Hook)

























1015H 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	I'm asking your opinion though, Witness.  Do you accept that there was a genocide, yes or no? 
A.	I do not have to accept it or deny it.  I gave you my position.  This is a legal matter, and history will determine what it was.  Do you wish for me to give my opinion on an event that occurred, and in which I was an actor? 
Q.	Just so we are quite clear:  You have no opinion as to whether it was a genocide, is that your position?  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I believe that I have made a number of statements here.  I'm afflicted and I was affected by these events.  It was as if you were making a film that was being shown to me.  I stated that I had deep regrets, but I -- and I'm crying inside even though you cannot see me crying.  That is how we have been brought up.  In my country, men do not cry, but it is not because you cannot see me crying that I am not crying.  
Q.	Well, can I phrase it a little differently:  Do you accept that Tutsi were targeted on account of their ethnicity, and that there was a campaign in Kigali-ville from April to July to destroy them as an ethnic group? 
A.	That the Tutsis were targeted when the events in Kigali broke out is obvious.  The Hutus were 
killed -- and Hutus were killed in Kigali is also obvious.  The campaign -- as for the campaign you are referring to, I'm not aware of it.  I do know that efforts were made on both sides in order to restore peace, but those who were attempting to do so did not have the requisite means or resources to do so and the means or resources they might have used were not there.  I thank you.  
Q.	You aren't seriously suggesting to the Trial Chamber that it was just the same for the Hutus in Kigali as it was for the Tutsi between April and July 1994, or are you? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I tried to demonstrate that the situation that broke out in Kigali on the 6th was, in fact, the result of a number of events that had taken place during the period from 
January to April of 1994.  There were a number of incidents that led to deaths and to -- and to the displacement of people.  So, people were targeted because, as I stated before this Trial Chamber, the war developed with the constitution of one bloc against the war and against the RPF, and another one who was for the RPF.  So, this is the reason for the attacks that occurred in Kigali, and it was not only in Kigali but throughout the country.  I thank you.  
Q.	Well, I think we have seen in the last three days that perhaps one of the reasons you were appointed as préfet, Mr. Renzaho, is that you were a -- and are a very good raconteur.  But if you could get back to my question, which is:  Do you -- are you seriously suggesting that it was just the same for Tutsi in Kigali-ville between April the 6th and July 1994 as it was for the Hutu?  Are you able to answer that question? 
A.	I wish to apologise to you, Counsel for the Prosecution, but I have not truly understood your question.  Could you please repeat it? 

MR. PRESIDENT:
You have mentioned, Mr. Renzaho that Tutsi were killed and Hutu were killed.  The question is: Whether they were in the same situation in terms of being targeted from April to July in 1994? 
THE WITNESS:
Certainly not, the Hutus and the Tutsis were not in the same situation and did not experience the events in the same way because, once again, one has to place oneself in the war context.  It was a war that came from outside, and which was supplied by external forces.  

People who were attacked by their neighbours were, first of all, people who had sent their children to the RPF or who had any link whatsoever with the RPF.  So, these events occurred in the context of war and of great fear.  I am not taking responsibility for anyone's behaviour because individual behaviour under such circumstances can be controversial.  Because of the individuals themselves, who were involved, as well as the behaviours of people, I am not in the mind of anyone to say that X did this or Y did that.  I am not in their minds, but what I'm trying to tell you about is the state of mind that prevailed at the time of the situation.  

There were elements, which were -- or movements outside from Kigali which led to further disorder.  And what people did, one cannot say that they did following instructions given by any specific person, and this is what I'm attempting to do, Counsel for the Prosecution, not in order to fabricate stories. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	So is it your evidence that the only Tutsis who were having problems were those who had family members in the RPF? 
A.	I am not stating that the -- only Tutsis who encountered problems were those who had members of their family who had joined the RPF, but they were those who were attacked at first.  And all the people who came into town mixed the other ones up with potential RPF members.  So, the situation deteriorated, but the first attacks were against people who were suspected of having links with the RPF.  

I can give you the example of your witness.  You put a question -- or, the Defence put a question to BUO, and asked him whether some people from Rugenge who had been attacked had any links with the RPF.  And that was his answer; he confirmed it and I believe it is true.  I thank you.  
Q.	Well, you have still left me somewhat unclear, Mr. Renzaho.  Do you accept, for example, that it was completely unsafe for Tutsi to move throughout the city of Kigali between the 6th of April and July when you left, whereas for those carrying Hutu identification cards, it was not nearly so unsafe?  Do you agree with that proposition? 
A.	Did I ever say the contrary?  Frankly, sir, I do not believe I did.  It was a situation that evolved between the different components of our population, and which divided them progressively.  And when the war broke out in Kigali, after three or four months of the presence of RPF elements, there was nothing to hide and we were moving towards the setting up of the transitional government.  

And, I believe, that what you're saying means that people attacked one another.  And in the confusion, people confused Tutsis with others.  If you saw a person with a beautiful face and considered him to be a Tutsi immediately, then you can understand that things were not going as they should.  I am convinced that the Tutsis could not move throughout the city as you stated; that is true.  I noted that because their first reaction was to flee towards sheltering centres, which were not organised by the administration.  I was not the one who put the first refugees at the Mille Collines hotel.  I took note of the fact that there were refugees at the Hôtel des Mille Collines, or that there were refugees at Saint Paul's or refugees at Sainte Famille and so on and so forth.  

So once they were identified, we tried to protect the sites and provide assistance.  But as to push people to join -- to go to such locations, you will understand that it did not come from me, and that it was a reflex they had.  

Mr. President, I should note that the operational -- the commander for the Kigali operational sector said in his report of January of 1994, that the Tutsi populations had a tendency to seek shelter in locations that were protected by UNAMIR from that date, so you will understand that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Renzaho, now we are in cross-examination.  In examination-in-chief, you are given ample time to explain your points of view.  But, when it now comes to cross-examination, when the questions are precise and very often only require a yes or no answer, then you must really make an attempt now.  So, please be briefer.  We have made such appeals to you also during the examination-in-chief, including your counsel, but now I must really insist.  

And the second remark:  Remember the speed, please slow down.  

Here comes the next question.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Do you accept, Mr. Renzaho, that Tutsi civilians were viewed as accomplices of the RPF? 
A.	Yes, that was possible in the confusion that we were living through. 
Q.	And it's fair to say, isn't it, Mr. Renzaho, from having heard your testimony in the last three days that you personally placed the vast majority of the blame for the events leading up to the 6th of April with the RPF.  Is that correct?  Is that a fair summary, and I only need a yes or no? 
A.	Counsel, I do not properly understand your question.  
Q.	The events that you have described -- at least, between January and April the 6th that took place in Kigali, you place the blame fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the RPF, don't you? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And that must have made you extremely angry towards the RPF and its accomplices, correct? 
A.	Yes, I think -- and that is maybe what the RPF wanted.  
Q.	Do you accept that there were even in the month of April alone as many as 67,000 bodies uplifted by your préfectoral authority in and around Kigali city, as was stated in the report that we -- in the document from Mr. Gaillard? 
A.	I have not read that document, but that doesn't mean that I'm denying the evidence that there were deaths in Kigali.  But I don't know about the figure.  It is true that the ICRC removed bodies, and it may know the figure of persons who died.  Thank you. 
Q.	Well, in that document, and it's P. 106, Mr. Gaillard says that he was told in confidence the figure from a préfectoral person in the préfectoral authority.  So, my question for you is:  Were you, as préfet, not aware of the types of figures of bodies that were being collected in your region throughout April to July? 
A.	I don't know about the figure.  I have explained to you the circumstances under which the removal of bodies was organised, and the ICRC conducted that operation.  I was not the one who drew up the statistics on that occasion.  Thank you.  
Q.	You were the most senior communal official in PVK.  Did you never try to find out the extent of the civilian killings in Kigali? 
A.	I would have loved to do so, but I could not, Counsel, because time had not stopped its flight, and fighting was really at its most intense at the period under consideration.  So, the work that you think should have been done could not have been done.  Thank you.  
Q.	Well, when do you say the fighting was at its most intense, Witness? 
A.	Counsel, I'd say that the fighting was always intense, with a small lull between the 9th and the 16th, and then intense shelling everywhere.  
Q.	And are we talking April, when you say the 9th, and 10th, and the 16th? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel.  
Q.	And is it your evidence today that it remained intense till the beginning of July when you evacuated from Kigali? 
A.	That is very correct, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	Now, you said at the very end of your testimony that you were thanking the Trial Chamber because this was an opportunity for you to give your account of the events between April and July.  Do you remember saying that? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	In fact, in 1997, after you had become aware of some of the allegations against you, you wrote an account of the events in Kigali from April to July, didn't you? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, I believe I did that.  
MR. MOSES:
I'm wondering if -- Your Honour, it's the top document in the new bundle.  I believe there's French and English.  I'm wondering if the registry could just show Mr. Renzaho the document just so -- 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	I may come back to it later, Mr. Renzaho, I don't want to -- to go into it at the moment, but I just want to make sure that we are talking about the same document.  

I'm sorry, it's the second -- the second document and it's entitled, "Témoignage sur la tragedie".
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Testimonies on the tragedy".  
MR. MOSES:
And it goes on, and I won't try and offend the French booth or the French speakers.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	All right -- and it's, I think, in the French about 26 pages long with it ending, "C'est à Brazzaville" on the 29th of April 1997, your name and "ancien préfet de la ville de Kigali".  Is that right?  
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	I may come back to it later, so I just wanted to make sure that we were on the same wavelength.  
So you can put that to one side for the moment.  

Now, Mr. Renzaho, do you agree that it was part of your responsibilities as préfet to keep the peace, maintain public order and the security of people and goods? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	And in that regard, you agree, don't you, that you had specific control over a police force in PVK; that's also correct, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, in normal times, yes.  But, in the exceptional circumstances of April to July 1994, I have explained the difficulties that had cropped up in that area.  
Q.	So, do you accept that between April and July, there were sometimes a difference in terms of what the law stated and what actually was happening on the ground?  I don't need any explanation or examples, but as a matter of principle, do you accept that proposition? 
A.	I accept it, and I said it was a period of anarchy.  
Q.	You also had the power to requisition gendarmerie, didn't you? 
A.	That is true, but I've explained the difficulties here.  
Q.	We've heard your explanation.  

How many requisitions did you make during the period of April to July 1994? 
A.	I -- I didn't make the statistics, but the situation was what it was at the time, and such a request could be on a daily basis.  But, they did not reply because there were difficulties related to staff strength and availability.  
Q.	Do you accept that requisitions could not be challenged by the gendarmerie, unless the requisition was illegal? 
A.	Yes, I do acknowledge that; that is true.  But you can only give what you have.  
Q.	And in terms of what was happening in April to July 1994, you could have ordered police to arrest those who were committing offences, couldn't you? 
A.	Yes, and that is what I did.  
Q.	Now, you've told us that you had signed the letter appointing a new conseiller in the secteur of Nyarugenge that was to replace Mr. Sezibera, wasn't it? 
A.	I hesitated a bit to answer that.  Nyarugenge secteur should not be mixed up with Nyamirambo secteur, whose conseiller was Céleste Sezibera.  
Q.	All right, putting that to one side, do you accept that Mr. Sezibera was removed from his position at the end of April 1994? 
A.	Yes, that was done within the legal procedure provided for by the law of 23 November 1963.  
Q.	And why, according to you, was he removed? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I'd like to recall here that the witness came and explained the circumstances under which that conseiller was replaced.  He provided information he had received on the ground, and he was simply -- he was replaced simply because he preferred to take shelter at the time when fighting was moving closer to his secteur, and the population moved to protect the préfecture. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The date of the 1963 act was?  Can you just repeat it? 
THE WITNESS:
I spoke of the law of the commune, a law to govern communes and their functioning.  It has been amended several times ever since, but I don't have all the provisions in mind.  But -- but all the procedures are laid down in that law.  

I don't have the specific article, but I'm simply saying that Sezibera's replacement was done by his bourgmestre, and I accepted that he be replaced because he was not available.  And by so doing, I was exercising my oversight authority.  I was not the one who signed the arbitrary replacement of Sezibera. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The 23rd of November, wasn't it?  It's just the date, Mr. Renzaho, I didn't hear you clearly.  Did you say the "23rd of November" and then we'll move on? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Do you agree that other conseillers were appointed during the period of April to July 1994? 
A.	Those who had died were replaced, yes, that's correct.  
Q.	And you replaced them? 
A.	Yes, it was -- where it was possible to do so, I did so.  I -- I approved the acts or the -- the moves made by the respective bourgmestres.  
Q.	And Mr. Sezibera was replaced by a Mr. Kaboyi -- spelt K-A-B-O-Y-I, wasn't he? 
A.	Well, the name doesn't ring a bell; it is possible.  
Q.	And Mr. Kaboyi was someone who had excelled in the area of killing Tutsi; that's correct, isn't it? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I don't have any evidence to prove that.  
Q.	Well, we've heard from both Prosecution and Defence witnesses, Mr. Renzaho, that you had been informed during the period of April to July of the activities of at least three conseillers who were said to be actively involved in organising militia; namely, the names given by your witnesses were:  
Mr Karekezi, Odette Nyirabagenzi, and Rose Karushara.  Do you agree with what your own witnesses have said that you were advised of their activities during April to July? 
A.	Well, the person who said so -- I know that some persons actually came here before this Chamber, yes, that is a fact that I cannot deny.  But, the person who said it, did he also tell you that he came and informed me? 
Q.	Well, the record, I believe, will show that yes, he did. 
A.	Well, if he did so, then maybe I should explain -- 
MR. CANTIER:
Sorry --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says, Counsel Cantier.
MR. CANTIER:
-- objection.  You have to give us references, Counsel for the Prosecution, and to advise us that this or that document has to be used.  Otherwise we'll be made figureheads and that does not really suit me. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The pseudonym of the witness? 
MR. MOSES:
I'll come back to it, maybe after lunch when I have located the exact passage in the transcript, 
Your Honours.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, do you agree, Mr. Renzaho, that you were the most senior government official based permanently in Kigali after the interim government had left to go to Gitarama on the 12th of April? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I was not aware, and I did not receive any confirmation of that.  If you want further explanations, I'll give them to you.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, you've told us that the interim government went to Gitarama on the 12th of April; correct? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	Well, I'll rephrase it.  Were you the most senior civilian authority in Kigali-ville after that date who was based permanently in Kigali? 
A.	I was not the -- the highest government civil servant based in Kigali, and that is what I said.  I was not aware of that, and I did not receive any order appointing me as the highest government civil servant based in Kigali.
MR. MOSES:
Sorry, Your Honour, that might be an appropriate time to take the morning break.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will adjourn until 11:25.  
(Court recessed from 1100H to 1130H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Moses.  
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, do you accept as a matter of general understanding that people, quite apart from any legal powers that a person might have, can be powerful because of the position they hold or their personality?  Do you agree with me in general terms with that statement? 
A.	I am sorry, but I frankly did not understand your question.  
Q.	Do you accept that people can be powerful, and that people will obey certain people not just because of any legal instruments that might give a person power? 
A.	Yes, it is true, that exists.  I accept this proposition.  
Q.	You were a good organiser, correct? 
A.	You are the one making such a statement.  I do not know; I had superiors and they never made any specific observation to me on this matter.  I thank you.  
Q.	All right, an important part of your job was to delegate, do you agree with that? 
A.	I delegated when it was necessary to do so, and I did so because I could not be everywhere at the same time -- and because the situation required that immediate and urgent actions be conducted.  I thank you.  
Q.	We've heard from a number of witnesses, you will agree that you were often wearing your military uniform during the period 6th of April to July.  Do you agree that you were often wearing your full colonel's uniform? 
A.	Yes, I accept that I was.  It was a uniform that enabled me to move around.  It was easier -- more reassuring for me to go out wearing my uniform than wearing civilian attire, because when I was wearing -- because even when I was wearing my military uniform I was sometimes not recognised.  Imagine what would have happened if I were -- if I had been wearing civilian clothes everywhere.  
Q.	Well, you weren't wearing, as you've stated, your colonel's uniform as a fashion statement or because you looked good in uniform, were you? 
A.	Certainly not, Counsel for the Prosecution.  That is not my type and it was not also something I would do given my age.  I thank you.  
Q.	You wore it because it represented to those who you were coming in contact with -- be they military or civilian people, your rank and seniority.  You were someone to be listened to and obeyed.  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I do not accept your proposition and I wish to tell you that I never put my stars on my insignia.  Thank you.  
MR. MOSES:
Your Honours, I believe I'm just being handed the transcript of the relevant passage, which I'll -- 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness -- sorry, Mr. Renzaho, Witness UT described the activities or what that person had been told in relation to the militia and that the names that I referred to earlier of the three conseillers were those who were being supported and encouraged by the militia.  My question to you is:  Do you accept that you were told about the activities of any of your conseillers? 
A.	I wish to state -- and I'm repeating the answer I had provided -- I was expecting a report from the bourgmestre on the activities of specific conseillers and this report was not forthcoming.  
Q.	Witness UT was asked in cross-examination:

"Presumably, you reported to your superior, the préfet, what you had been told about his conseillers."

The answer: "Yes, indeed, I reported to him on the situation in the roadblocks and in the city."

Question: "But specifically, you would have told him, wouldn't you, Witness, about the negative reports you were getting about three of his conseillers?"

And the answer: "Yes, I discussed that with him.  I talked about the negative influence as I said, the negative influence on the young people manning the roadblocks." 

So I'll ask you again, Mr. Renzaho:  Do you recall being told about the activities of your conseillers and the negative influence they were having in the area under your control? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, we are -- we were on the ground -- our two feet on the ground and we were experiencing a situation in Kigali which was negative, that is for sure.  I am wondering whether any specific conseiller is involved here since the situation was bad throughout the secteurs; that is the first observation I can make.  

The second observation:  The reports I might have received were reports on the situation prevailing.  As for reports on individuals, I might -- or could have received such reports, that is true.  But -- and perhaps this is your objective, what we're talking about is identifying the culprit and punishing him or her.  And we are dealing with, in fact, who does what.  We are talking about communal staff, which comes under the law I referred to previously, and for whom decisions are made within the communal council.  

The préfet has the right of oversight but can only intervene subsequently in order to approve or perhaps refuse the measure adopted, but that measure has to be taken somewhere along the line.  I thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Renzaho, do you remember having had a conversation with Witness UT about these matters? 
THE WITNESS:
I could receive information coming from all sides, but an individual or specific conversation on a person acting in that way -- well, what I can say is that if it was an isolated case amongst all the situations we were faced with, well, that is possible.  But that was the general situation.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So did you have such a conversation with UT? 
THE WITNESS:
I would not be able to give you a -- an answer in the affirmative regarding this case.  I do not recall such a conversation, Mr. President.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Did you have any conseillers disciplined or arrested during the period April to July 1994? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I did not have the requisite powers to discipline the conseillers.  I could resort to the bourgmestres to request that a conseiller be sanctioned.  
Q.	Did you resort to that? 
A.	Obviously during the different meetings I had with the bourgmestres I asked them to keep a tight hand on their staff and that they redress the situation.  
Q.	So, that is "no" to my specific question? 
A.	Regarding your question -- namely, ABX, I did not do that.  I took note of the general situation; I asked the people in charge to get involved.  I was not the bourgmestre of a commune which was resisting -- it being understood that the largest part of the commune had disappeared.  I had not been demoted to the level of bourgmestre in order to fulfil his duties.  The bourgmestre was present.  Thank you.  
Q.	And no conseillers were arrested, were they, during the period of April to July 1994 for their involvement in the killings that were going on throughout Kigali? 
A.	Those conseillers -- whether they were alone or whether they had brigades or forces to perpetrate such acts -- the situation would not be as disastrous as the one we were faced with.  I do not believe I saw any conseiller who was removed from his position or who was sanctioned for having perpetrated such acts.  And I -- and nobody was ever brought to me who had been caught in the act of perpetrating such acts, and I had -- I don't believe I was ever asked to sanction anyone who had perpetrated such acts and who was brought to me.  I thank you.  
Q.	And just getting back to my question:  You never asked for any of the conseillers to be arrested, correct? 
A.	Perhaps I was not a good préfet in this préfecture -- since I did not have a good intelligence service.  But I was not given any specific information on the X case for any violent acts that might have been perpetrated in order for me to be able to take any legal administrative action in that regard.  Thank you.  
Q.	Do you agree, Mr. Renzaho, that you were meeting with your conseillers regularly throughout April, May and June 1994? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, the conseillers were the conseillers of the Nyarugenge commune.  
They came to see their bourgmestres, and on the occasion of the meetings I had with the bourgmestres, those conseillers were present.  I can state that for a fact.  
Q.	Can you state an answer to my question?  Did you meet regularly with the conseillers throughout April, May and June? 
A.	Regularly, I wouldn't say so.  I met with those conseillers in the presence of their bourgmestres when I had meetings with the bourgmestres.  
Q.	After the meeting you say took place on the 8th of April, do you agree that there were several other meetings -- four or five during April 1994? 
A.	That is correct, there were meetings throughout the period; that is true.  
Q.	And at those meetings, it wasn't just the conseillers who were in attendance, there were sometimes military people? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I did not summon any soldiers to attend meetings at the préfecture.  
The people who were involved in security meetings are well-known, and I do not know whether soldiers came to meetings at the préfecture when there was no framework that involved them.  Soldiers are managed by their units and by their general staff.  Thank you.  
Q.	You told us on Monday, I believe, that on the 8th of April there were some senior military people at the meeting with the conseillers.  Wasn't that your evidence? 
A.	Yes, that is what I stated.  But the soldiers who were there were there in -- because of their positions.  Colonel Rutayisire, for example, who went to the meeting, was an officer who was working at the ministry of national defence, and it was his right to try to know what was being said there.  He was probably looking for information and found ways of getting the information.  This is how we came to mention his presence on that occasion.  I thank you.  
Q.	And sometimes there would be members of political parties, as well, wouldn't there? 
A.	I told you that under the circumstances that were prevailing in Kigali after the 6th, where all the top people left as rapidly as possible, I would not have been in a position to convene a meeting of political leaders to meet with them.  

I stated before this Trial Chamber on Monday or Tuesday, that I asked the communal authorities to involve all the groups that had any influence on fringes of the society in order for them to raise the awareness of the partisans to the need to maintain security in the locality, and I believe that was done.  But, at the level of the préfecture I was faced with a number of difficulties, and I don't see how I could have convened a meeting with all of these people when they had already left.  Thank you.  
Q.	Now, your governmental boss -- if I can use that expression -- was the prime minister, correct? 
A.	Yes, he was the head of the government; that is true.  
Q.	And from the 8th of April through to the July that person was Jean Kambanda, correct? 
A.	I beg to differ.  Kambanda took his oath of office on the 9th, and for the rest of the period he was, indeed, the prime minister; that's true.  
Q.	Okay.  And you've told us that you'd visit Gitarama to see the government on various occasions during April to July; that's correct, isn't it? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I do know that, in general, one needs to look at the situation in relative terms.  In all situations, one must take due account of the difficulties we were faced with at the time.  
It is true that I went to Gitarama, but when you're referring to several occasions, I don't think so.  But for the period which is of interest to us, I might have gone there on three occasions perhaps.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Remember the speed, Mr. Renzaho, not too fast.  

The next question, please. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And Mr. Kambanda visited Kigali on a few occasions as well during that period, didn't he? 
A.	Frankly, I was so engrossed in the problems I was faced with that I did not monitor the schedule of Prime Minister Kambanda closely.  However, I can state here that he passed through the préfecture once in the afternoon, and I recall that we talked for 30 minutes and then he left.  And that was the only occasion when I saw him in Kigali.  I thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, you're well aware, aren't you, of the various things that Mr. Kambanda has said about you after his arrest.  That's the case, isn't it?  You've seen what he had to say about you? 
A.	I am not aware of that, Counsel for the Prosecution.  And as for what he said, it's his own business.  I was not his cabinet director; I was not a close colleague of his.  I am a minister of the interior, and -- well, I don't know.  
Q.	The Prosecution disclosed various tapes of interviews with Mr. Kambanda to the Defence last year.  
Did you not consider it interesting to see what the prime minister had to say about you? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I don't see -- I don't have any interest in that, absolutely not.  
Q.	All right.  Well, I'll refer you to a couple of passages and ask for your comments on them, if I may.  
MR. MOSES:
And, Your Honours, in the new bundle of documents it is number 5 -- I'm sorry, number 4.  And the English transcript doesn't have numbers other than K numbers.  And it's K0154891, and I'm wondering if the Accused could be provided with a copy of this document -- the French.  
Your Honours, I'm referring to the ninth series of questions down.  It starts with a question, "Renzaho was the préfet of préfets, correct?" 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And Mr. Renzaho, it's on -- in the French, on page 31.  And -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's be absolutely certain that we have the document.  This transcript you are referring to, does it have a title? 
MR. MOSES:
The top of the English, it just says,"Side B".  And in the French, it says, "Face B de la cassette quinze".  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"End of tape 15", in French.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now the document is found.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, do you see the passage?  There are two questions and answers. 
A.	Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution, I have been able to find the reference, but -- 
Q.	If you could just read those two paragraphs and I'll ask you for a comment.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What's the wording of the first question you want him to read out so that we don't mix up the question? 
MR. MOSES:
"Renzaho was the préfet of préfets, correct?"  And then there is an answer.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you seen that, Mr. Renzaho?  On page 31, the fifth line. 
THE WITNESS:
I am there.  Do you wish for me to read it out?  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Not at all.  Do you agree with the comments from Mr. Kambanda that you were -- you had the radio at your disposal? 
A.	Well, Counsel for the Prosecution, please let me set the record straight.  It should be understood that I will answer your questions, but Mr. Kambanda came to testify in most of the trials here.  If he had things to say regarding myself, he could have come here.  

The second point I wish to raise:  I saw Kambanda for the first time during the meeting of the préfets on the 11th of April of 1994.  He left Kigali on the 12th of April of 1994.  He came back in May, and that was the only occasion when I saw him in the afternoon, and that was the last time I saw him.  And I wish to state that to give an opinion on someone you have never -- who has never come under your responsibility and you do not know is being pretentious.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, let's be quite clear, I'm just asking on a comment on what he says there.  You can agree with it or disagree with.  He said that you had the radio at your disposal.  Do you agree with that or not? 
A.	Prosecution Counsel, the national radio was under the jurisdiction of the minister of information.  I received no instructions that placed Radio Rwanda under my command.  True, I sent messages through the radio, but was I the only one to do so?  So that is my answer; my answer is no.  
Q.	Thank you for that.  The next passage which I'd like you to comment on is in the same document.  
It's -- the English is K014884 (sic), and it's the twelfth line or paragraph down commencing with the words, "Can we take it that Renzaho had total control over Kigali at the time."

And Mr. Renzaho, in the French, it's on page 23.  Do you have page 23 there? 
A.	Yes, I've found it.  
Q.	At about two-thirds of the way down, there is a question which has initials "M", "D" for Delta, beginning (French spoken)... 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Should we then consider..."
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I've seen it. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, I'd just like you to read the following seven or eight lines, and then I'll ask you a question.  
A.	"So, from there" --
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, you don't need to read it out aloud, just read it to yourself and I'll ask you a question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the English K number there, just to be absolutely certain, is K0154884.  
MR. MOSES:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, do you agree with the prime minister where he said -- agreed that it was clear that you had total control over Kigali at the time? 
A.	Counsel, I'll respond in the negative.  If I had control over the situation in Kigali, I would have remained in Kigali.  And I don't know why he spoke about me, whereas there were soldiers who were fighting against the RPF.  This situation is unreal -- in the sense that the person explaining it knows perfectly nothing about what was happening.  That is the impression I have.  But to speak of total control over Kigali, I think it's a bad joke.  Thank you.  
Q.	Thank you for that.  

Now, I just want to focus now on your relationship with the Interahamwe prior to April 1994.  Do you accept, Mr. Renzaho, that you were involved in recruiting people for the Interahamwe as early as 1992? 
A.	No, and to drive home the point, no.  I don't know how many times I have to say that -- no.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Renzaho, I need your help.  I didn't understand your answer which is the same in both languages.  

"If I had control over the situation in Kigali, I would have remained in Kigali." 

What exactly did you mean by that? 
THE WITNESS:
What I mean is that as he says, if I had the possibility of controlling the situation in Kigali, we would not have been chased away like -- like chickens or like cowards.  We would not have experienced so much destruction.  We would have organised things and channeled them in the right direction; that is what I meant.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you are partly referring to the presence of RPF forces in Kigali, and the fact that in July, the armed forces had to leave? 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I am referring to the entire situation that we lived through:  A situation of chaos characterised by fighting and killing; a situation where you had people coming from all over in total confusion and despair.  That is the situation that I wanted to point out, Mr. President.  
MR. MOSES:
	I'm wondering if Mr. Renzaho could please be shown a document which is in the new bundle of documents, number 3.  It's a document in French which is headed, "Mouvement democratique republicain".  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Republican democratic movement".
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, have you seen this document before? 
A.	I do confirm that I've seen the document, Counsel.  
Q.	It was a document which was signed off on 14th of May 1992 by Dr. Anastase Gasana; that's correct, isn't it? 
A.	Counsel, I saw the document here.  I did not see that document as part of my duties, but I only got to know about it here.  
(Pages 17 to 31 by Jean Baigent)






1215H 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Right.  But the document is the 14th of May 1992, isn't it?  If you look at the last page in the French.  
A.	That is correct, Counsel.  
Q.	And if you look on the French page 3 and 4, and in the English it's on page 5 and 6, it's -- sets out in the document the brains behind the Interahamwe, and it gives a list at the beginning of the persons considered to be in charge of recruiting amongst civilians.  And there are some familiar names there.  What I am interested in and want you to comment on is, under those charged with recruiting, from amongst the reservists, and it lists Colonel Serubuga, Colonel Sagatwa, S-A-G-A-T-W-A, Lieutenant Colonel Anatole Nsengiyumva, Colonel Bagosora, Lieutenant Colonel Tharcisse Renzaho, with the comment:  

"Literally deranged after the media campaign accusing him of having appropriated the property of Kigali businessmen on the run.  He is ready to go at any length to ensure that this city is set ablaze, as Nero did in the past."  

Now, you'll agree with me, having read that, Mr. Renzaho, it's not just Witness XXY who testified here who's suggesting you were involved in recruiting Interahamwe.  The MDR party was making such an allegation in respect of you as early as May 1992, weren't they?  
A.	Prosecution witness (sic), can I answer?  Thank you very much.  And I think I will have to ask you to be a bit patient on this issue so I can provide the necessary explanation.  The document comes from Mr. Anastase Gasana who, before he moved over to the MDR party, was the ideologist of the MRND party, in the same capacity as the other senior civil servants who belonged to the MRND and who moved into other opposition parties, and were forced to produce documents of this nature.  I would take the case of Mfisi, Christophe, who coined the concept of Akazu, the death squads, and many others.  So the context in which this document is written is very well circumscribed.  

And I am here before the Chamber; I would like to enlighten the Chamber to the fact that this same document was presented in Brussels during the meeting of political parties that are members of the democratic forum for change who were negotiating with the RPF for political cooperation.  So an understanding was arrived at, and other ideas were expressed in that communiqué that came up on 3 June 1992.  All these documents are available.  

Now, concerning my humble self sitting here before you, I would simply like to tell you that I faced difficulties; that can be imagined.  The democratisation process, because on the 14 May we are in the aftermath of the setting up of the coalition government, headed by a prime minister from the opposition.  So what is written here is really baseless, because the opposition had the majority in that government.  And it was headed by a prime minister from the opposition.  

My difficulty at the time was not to give in from the standpoint of other insecurity, not to give in to blackmail and subversive activities or other activities that disrupted security in the city of Kigali.  And I had the misfortune of not being a member of a party that could support me.  That was the delicate position in which I found myself at the time.  

What he has said, he refers to a charge that was brought before this Chamber, and I believe that I explained how the property of traders was ruled upon by a government decision.  I will leave aside the abusive allegations that have been made against me; it does not affect me in any way.  But we are talking about 1992.  And the strategy of taking over power, to the great displeasure of the people's wish, tended towards an overthrow of the institutions, at best, with the alliance with the RPF and a revolution.  And as I have said here, I have had to contend with violent demonstrations, attacks on the institutions and the presidency.  I cannot cite all the difficulties I faced that the period here.  

Now, let's go on to this central issue of recruitment.  I think this is backbiting, or -- because Serubuga, who is mentioned here, was deputy chief of staff and he had been driven away by the political parties.  And, in my humble opinion, in my position as the préfet of the city of Kigali, I did not have the possibility of recruiting reservists, as they are governed by the law.  What would I recruit them for, for what army?  That is what I don't understand.  And to illustrate my point, I would like to inform the Chamber that I've learnt of witnesses who came before this Chamber, or in other Chambers of this Tribunal, there is a certain Munyandekwe (phonetic) -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
His microphone is off, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, I think -- I think we have to stop there, Mr. Renzaho.  

Do we agree that Christophe Mfisi's last name is spelt M-F-I-S-I?  Is that correct?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, that is correct.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	You were involved, weren't you, Mr. Renzaho, with the recruiting of Interahamwe, including, through EFOTEC school, a meeting on Saint Juvénal's day 1993?  Yes or no.  
A.	Prosecution Witness (sic), maybe I will take advantage of this to end what I was saying. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, you see, you gave us quite an elaborate explanation in relation to the previous answer, and now we want a yes or no answer to this Saint Juvénal celebration, or recruitment process, whatever happened.  Can you please answer that question?  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  And my answer would be very short:  No.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And the Interahamwe, at least on one occasion in the latter part of 1993, left from your house to go for training by bus.  Correct?  Yes or no?  
A.	No.  Maybe they left from somewhere, but not from my home.  
Q.	And some of their clothing was washed and hung outside your house as well, wasn't it?  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I am not compelled to repeat what other witnesses have said before the Chamber.  So I tell you no -- 
MR. MOSES:
I'm wondering if the witness could be shown Prosecution Exhibit 20.  It -- for Your Honours it's under tab 14.  It's a letter dated the 3rd of December 1992.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Do you have that letter there in front of you, Mr. Renzaho?  
A.	Yes, Counsel, I do.  
Q.	And it was a letter from the prosecutor of the republic to the minister of justice, concerning activities of the Interahamwe.  And the bit which I'm wanting to draw your attention to is perhaps two-thirds of the way down, the paragraph commencing (French spoken).  And if you could quietly read that paragraph to yourself, and I'll then ask you a question.  
A.	I am ready.  
Q.	Now, that letter, you'll agree with me, is a few months after the date of the MDR document which we've just looked at.  And in this letter, the prosecutor finds it astonishing that the préfet of Kigali and others named in the letter -- but he names you specifically -- have remained indifferent faced with those acts.  That's what it -- in summary, that's what it says there.  Do you agree with me?  
A.	I've read the paragraph.  So what you say is actually found in the paragraph is correct.  
Q.	Thank you.  
A.	(Microphones overlapping) 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I will ask my next question.  It may be relevant to your answer.  Would you agree with me that it wouldn't be so astonishing if the préfet was in fact involved in the training and recruiting and support of those same Interahamwe?  
A.	Thank you for your question, Counsel for the Prosecution.  But I am astonished at the interpretation that you give the situation.  In the paragraph, the incident is happening in Kicukiro commune.  And in that -- and in that commune, there was a bourgmestre.  I am accused of receiving an administrative report from Kicukiro commune and refusing to act on it, whereas within the same period they have an urban council security structure that deals fully with the issue, and in which the state prosecutor's office of Kigali was involved.  The situation is clear and unequivocal.  If there were no other manoeuvres as there were at the time, tell me sincerely, what would stop officials from addressing a situation that broke out in a clearly identified area of the Kigali préfecture, whereas there was a coordination organ in which the officials concerned apparently met?  So that is the situation that I find disturbing.  

Personally, I ascribe that way of looking at things to agitation, and there are various forms of agitation -- or, there were many forms of agitation at the time.  Maybe that is not the issue under consideration at this time, but we should situate this issue in its proper perspective at the time.  Thank you.  
Q.	All right.  We'll move on now to the issue of control of the Interahamwe militia during the genocide.  You will recall Witness BUO describing you as the chief of his chief, and that he had a lot of respect for you, as well as his immediate chief.  Do you recall that evidence?  Yes or no?  It doesn't need an explanation, just a yes or no.  Do you remember the evidence?  
A.	I do remember the witness, but I do -- I did not remember everything he said.  But I do remember the witness.  
Q.	Well, there has been a -- also a good deal of evidence, you will agree, during the course of this trial, that amongst those who were in charge and leading Interahamwe were Angeline, Odette, and Rose.  You'll agree with me that there has been a good deal of evidence about that.  
A.	People said what they wished to say here before the Trial Chamber.  
Q.	Well, do you agree that those persons were in charge of Interahamwe?  
A.	I do not know anything about that.  My work consisted in managing the Kigali town préfecture with an infrastructure.  I had civil servants under me within the préfecture, as well as the communal staff in the communes.  That is what I can say, thank you.  
Q.	You had no idea, during the hundred days of the genocide, that these persons were in charge -- or, controlling any of the groups of militia that were causing problems; is that what you want the Trial Chamber to understand?  
A.	That I repeat myself, Counsel for the Prosecution, I believe I answered that question previously.  But since you're giving me the floor, perhaps I can try to demonstrate to you that sometimes one needs to be cautious regarding specific people.  If you are referring to BUO -- 
Q.	Witness, I -- I'm not referring just to BUO.  I'm referring to many witnesses, both Prosecution and Defence witnesses.  
A.	I was giving BUO as an example, because he stated that he went into his secteur on the 9th and he started -- frankly speaking, I never had any officers, even if they were -- did not receive sufficient training.  I never had any officers such as this one.  This was a matter on my conscience.  I need to say that.  Thank you.  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now the only issue is whether it is your view that you didn't know that Odette, Angeline, and Rose were playing a leading part in the Interahamwe activities during the hundred days.  Is that the evidence, you didn't know in 1994?  
THE WITNESS: 
I was not aware of that, and I wish to confirm it.  Had I known, I would have adopted the necessary measures.  I can state that.  Thank you.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	All right.  The next document I'd like you to look at is further part of the interview with Mr. Kambanda.  
MR. MOSES: 
It's in the other document, Your Honours, that we have provided.  Number 5, I believe.  And the bit I want to have the Accused look at and read, and I will ask him for his comments, in the French it is on page K0322897, that's page 6 down the bottom.  And for English, Your Honours, it's on page 6 also, K0154958.  It's the ninth paragraph down with the -- commencing with a question, "Okay, perhaps it was possible for this person, just as Mr. Renzaho".  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, do you see in the French, Mr. Renzaho, it's the third paragraph from the bottom which commences, in French, "Okay, (French spoken)".  And I would ask you to read from that point over to the next page, to the bottom of the fifth paragraph in French on the following page.  
MR. MOSES: 
And in the English, Your Honours, I'm focussing down to the fourth-to-bottom paragraph.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Let me know when you've finish reading that passage, Mr. Renzaho, and I will ask you a question for you to comment on.  
A.	I believe I've finished reading out the passage.  
Q.	Do you agree with Mr. Kambanda's assessment that, whilst you were never officially designated to be the head of the Interahamwe, that that was the conclusion that he drew from what he had seen and observed you doing?  
A.	I disagree with what he says, and I have never agreed with Mr. Kambanda.  Thank you.  
Q.	All right.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Your Honours, if we could now look at Prosecution Exhibit 29, which is one that was referred to by my learned friend this morning.  It's at tab 25 in the first bundle of exhibits.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I noted that in the Kambanda interview he uses the word "deduction". 
MR. MOSES: 
Absolutely.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, this is the document that was shown to you this morning, of which you claimed no knowledge of such a meeting.  You remember being shown that document, Mr. Renzaho?  
A.	Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution, I remember it.  
Q.	And I think you'd indicated that there would have been someone else perhaps present with you.  Perhaps if I could ask you to look at paragraph 9.  It's on the second page, where it says "Colonel Renzaho then had his préfet-adjoint, Mr. Simpunga, organise a meeting for 29 April, where the details of the plan could be worked out."  

Do you see that?  
A.	Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution, I have read item 9.  
Q.	And if one was to look at P. 33, which is at tab 29, that document, which will be shown to you, is in fact a memorandum which describes a meeting which in fact took place on the 29th of April involving Mr. Simpunga, Colonel Yaache, Major MacNeil, and others, doesn't it?  
A.	Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	It's somewhat puzzling, Mr. Renzaho, that the document recording a meeting involving you, which refers to one of the decisions being taken, namely that a meeting will be organised for the 29th of April, actually then does take place as recorded in P. 33.  Do you agree that's rather puzzling?  
A.	I agree with you, but the problem is not that it might be puzzling.  The problem is that you are telling me about Colonel Yaache, whom I don't know.  That is the problem.  Perhaps I have aged in the meantime, but I believe one would have remembered someone one would have met.  That is what is puzzling to me.  
Q.	Well, P. 29, at page -- at paragraph 6, records you as having said that:  

"These elements" which refers to the previous paragraph, namely, the Interahamwe "were behind the late president and his aims for the country, but were representatives of various political groups.  As such, he indicated that these elements were representing their individual political parties in the defence of the country."  And therefore Mr. Kajuga did not control them all.  

Well, do you agree with that statement?  I know you say you didn't have the meeting, but do you agree with the contents that were attributed to you?  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I can only agree with statements I made.  Do you have any evidence that such words came out of my mouth?  That is my question to you.  
Q.	Well, for the moment, I'm asking the questions, Mr. Renzaho, so perhaps you could answer my question.  The words attributed to you, do they -- do they reflect your thinking, namely that Mr. Kajuga was not in control of all the militia?  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I am saying no, I did not utter such words, and what is recounted here with regard to the situation shows quite clearly that the situation is much more complex than the authors of this document seem to say.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did Kabuga (sic) control all Interahamwe movements in April 1994, according to what you know?  
THE WITNESS: 
Your Honours, I would like to apologise for not answering correctly.  First of all, let me say that I am not aware of what one is referring to as Interahamwe.  As for the powers of Kajuga over the Interahamwe, I don't know anything about that.  So if I were to answer the question, it would mean that I had information.  How could I have such information?  I don't know anything about that.  I do know that I witnessed inflows of population, and that even the usual inhabitants of the town of Kigali were not involved in the scenes of violence we witnessed in Kigali after the 6th of April.  Thank you.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Did you not know Mr. Kajuga?  Is that your evidence?  
A.	I knew Kajuga by name, I knew that there was one Kajuga, and I knew him because of his family that I knew quite well, because his elder brother is someone I knew quite well.  And they are people who hail from my region.  So that was -- I did not have any other specific knowledge of that person.  
Q.	Well, the same document refers to you having said that the ICRC were perhaps exaggerating in their account of what the activities of the Interahamwe were, and it is -- it states here that you had also gone on to say that you were in charge of the forces within your area, that you indicated that due to a lack of trust in UNAMIR, neighbourhood militias had formed to protect themselves from the RPF, and that they were defending their neighbourhoods in concert with the overall aims of the government.  That's what you said at that meeting; isn't that correct, Mr. Renzaho?  
A.	My -- Counsel for the Prosecution, with all due respect, I might disappoint you, because I did not utter such words.  And let me explain to you that the ICRC had normal and daily dealings with the préfecture of the city of Kigali.  And in view of that, my subordinates worked with the ICRC, and the representative of the ICRC would phone -- would call me on the telephone regularly to tell me about his needs.  So I do not believe I would have said that the ICRC was exaggerating.  If it was exaggerating, I would have dealt with this matter with the ICRC.  

In addition, the forces that were in charge of the area, and who were fighting in the city of Kigali, as I might imagine, there were several such forces.  We had the Rwandan armed forces that were fighting against the forces of the RPF that were present.  But there was also -- but there were also all these gangs that were still in the city of Kigali.  So what forces are we talking about, and over which force could I claim to have authority during those difficult times?  I don't see what those forces might be.  If the forces were accessible, I would have had access to them.  But I must say that my answer is no.  
Q.	Well, I'm suggesting to you, Mr. Renzaho, that the reason you have a mental block in recalling this meeting is because you said things that you now wish you hadn't, because they have been recorded and are coming back to haunt you.  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I don't believe I am senile yet, and I believe I do recall what I witnessed, what I did, and I do remember the very serious events we lived through.  I have -- I am always saddened when I need to come back to such events.  If there was any other place where I could go, I would do so, gladly.  But I can tell you that I have no mental block whatsoever as far as I'm concerned, especially since the ICRC had excellent relations with the préfecture of Kigali.  I did my best.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The witness's microphone is off.  The interpreter cannot -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's all right, because the point now was simply to put to the witness what the Prosecution case is, and Mr. Renzaho has indicated that he maintains his view, and that is the point now.  

There are two minutes left.  Can you get through one more question, Mr. Moses?  
MR. MOSES: 
I can get through -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And an answer?  
MR. MOSES: 
That I can't guarantee, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Let's do that.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Do you accept that these gangs that you have described were in fact made up of the youth militias of the MRND and CDR parties?  Or is that something you don't know and aren't aware of?  
A.	I'm forced to reiterate what I stated, Counsel for the Prosecution.  What was happening in the city of Kigali was much more complex and much -- and was much broader in scope than what you are referring to here.  All the bandits who were killing and looting, were they from the MRND?  I'm not trying to protect anybody.  It was proven that the bandits -- was it proven that the bandits were people from the MRND and CDR?  If that were the case, I would condemn them, as I have always condemned bandits.  But I wish for you to observe that the situation in Kigali was much more complex than the situation you are describing.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's now 1 o'clock.  We will adjourn to 3 o'clock.  Tomorrow there is apparently scheduled a staff meeting concerning earthquakes.  That starts at 10:30. 
MR. MOSES: 
I wasn't intending to go, Your Honour, if that's any assistance.  I don't know if my learned friends were.  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
That is a problem we will have to come back to.  

The second issue is that at 12:30 tomorrow I have a status conference in another case, so at any rate we won't be able to sit until 1 or 2.  So that is the situation.  

The third practical issue is that we have now received the list of exhibits from the Defence.  Could I ask the Prosecution and the registry to have a look at this list in the break, and Mr. Matemanga will generally find out where the first Defence exhibit number will then start, with number 1, and tell us what the last exhibit number will be with number 28.  And we will then ask the Prosecution whether there are any objections against these 28 exhibits being tendered, and if not we will very simply do this in writing by the registry without reading it into the record.  But if you have a look at this list, Mr. Moses, to see whether this can be done in a very informal and simple way.  

Is there anything you want to say about this list, Maître Cantier?  It is self-explanatory and easy to read.  Anything you want to add?  
MR. CANTIER: 
No, Mr. President.  I simply was on my feet because you were addressing the Defence, Mr. President.  But there's nothing I wish to add.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So then we continue at 3 o'clock where the Bench will be sitting under 15 bis because Judge Egorov has another very important issue of a personal character.  

The Court is adjourned.  
(Court recessed at 1302H to 1504H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon.  Mr. Moses?  
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you have any comments on the list of exhibits?  
MR. MOSES: 
None other than to agree that those can go in.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Matemanga, number 1 on this list will then be which Defence exhibit number?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 82. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right, we will take it from there and we will tender from number 1 to number 27 on this list.  Thank you very much.

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Renzaho, your cross-examination continues.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, were you aware that the Interahamwe had headquarters at a restaurant in Kigali-ville, which was turned into their headquarters, named Petit Kigali?  Yes or no?  
A.	I did not know so.  
Q.	You have described the release and the circumstances that you say occurred when you released a person known as Kigingi, and also the person known as Sukari.  Do you accept that when you let Mr. Kigingi go free, that you also provided him with petrol vouchers?  Yes or no?  
A.	I did not provide him with petrol vouchers -- neither him nor anyone else.  And the circumstances under which that person was released are known; I have set them forth here.  
Q.	And Mr. Sukari, he was part of the civil defence in Nyakabanda secteur, wasn't he?  
A.	I know nothing of that.  I know that he was an individual of which it was said that he was killing people, and that at the time when that information was revealed, it wasn't in Nyakabanda secteur, it was near Café Lion in Nyamirambo where fighting was under way. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Or, "combat was under way".  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Let's get the spelling of the café, shall we?  

Can you help us, please?  The second word, of course, not the first.  
THE WITNESS: 
The second word was Léon (sic) -- Lion, L-I-O-N.  Lion.
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Do you remember being present at a meeting at PVK at the end of April or beginning of May when leader -- a leader or leaders from the MRND party gave money to one of the leaders of the Interahamwe, a Mr. Ndayitabi? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I did not participate in a meeting where this Ndayitabi was, whom I don't even know, attended by him, and I did not see any leader or responsable give him any money. 
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, Your Honours, Ndayitabi is on the Defence last list at number 357. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	So I'm and the Trial Chamber is quite clear, Mr. Renzaho, do you accept that you met with Interahamwe leaders at any time between the beginning of April and July 1994?  Yes or no?  
A.	I very much regret to say no.  
Q.	Did you meet with the leaders of the youth of the parties who made up the government at any time between April and July 1994?  
A.	Could you put that question fresh?  I'm sorry, I didn't fully grasp it.  
Q.	Did you ever meet with the youth of the parties that made up the government between April the 6th and July 1994?  
A.	Personally, I did not do so, because I told you the principle being applied, I would have invited political parties to speak of a situation with respect to their youth wings, and they might perhaps have been accompanied by their youth.  But I did not do so.  
MR. MOSES: 
I'm wondering if the witness can now be shown Prosecution Exhibit 27.  It's at tab 23 of the bundle of -- the Prosecutor's first folder of exhibits.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, Mr. Renzaho, this, the front cover sheet, is a memorandum from Dallaire to Annan dated the 25th of April 1994, and the cable refers to the fact that UNAMIR were able to monitor both Radio Rwanda and also from Radio Muhabura, M-U-H-A-B-U-R-A.  And on page 2, in the third paragraph, it reports that "The préfet of Kigali town held a meeting with the youth of the parties which form the present government."  

Does that refresh your memory at all to the fact that you did hold a meeting with the youth of the parties?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I think that I'm aware of what I say, conscious of what I say.  At that time I did not call a meeting of the youth wings of political parties, and there's a very good reason for that:  I did not know them.  I did not know them because the political parties were not organisations that were officially accredited to the préfecture of Kigali.  I told you that at communal level I'd asked the communal authorities to involve the political parties present in their commune in the best possible way so as to administer the population.  I had nothing apart from my civil servants.  Call the political parties?  Who?  Most important people had left the town.  And you ask me who was the president of the PSD youth wing?  I don't know him.  Who was the president of the youth wing of the MDR?  I did not know him.  The president of the youth wing of the PL party?  I did not know them.  So, please, Mr. Prosecutor, once more I think there are leaders -- some leaders of the youth wings of political parties who have testified here or there who say that I called at one time or another a meeting or held meetings with them.  Thank you.  
Q.	Well, do you recall, as is recorded in this memo, telling -- urging the youth to take weapons and defend the sovereignty of the country?  Yes or no?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, after the prime minister issued his instructions in the phase when, after the 25th of May, there was recruitment and training of young people to beef up the army, and following which there were efforts to dislodge the RPF from Mburabuturo and Gisozi; that I did do. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But here we have apparently a transcription from what was said on Radio Rwanda on the 24th of April, listened to by UNAMIR, apparently transcribed, and then sent to New York.  Why should such a mistake occur?  Do you have any theory how this could happen?  

THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, it was a long time ago, and maybe I don't -- in my head I can't recall the minor -- smallest incident.  The least I could do, perhaps if you could present me with a tape recording of what I said at that meeting and what was said over Radio Rwanda. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, you'll agree with me, Mr. Renzaho, that that wording, namely, it's recorded there that you had urged the youth to take up weapons and defend the sovereignty of the country, is very similar to what was recorded in P. 27 where there was the meeting that you don't remember, or deny taking place, where you had also been recorded as having said that the militia were defending the sovereignty of the country, or words to that effect.  It's very similar, isn't it?  
A.	Well, you can establish similarity between what is available.  The message in which I exhorted the youth to fight for the sovereignty is a message you can find in the speeches I made probably in the month of June, because I read it and I remember having said it.  This report here, these are reports made by technical departments to -- for the benefit of their superiors.  And I do not know to what extent, for what purpose the -- these reports were made.  So I cannot give my approval to something in which I did not participate.  If you want to ask -- ask me, for example, what was the leitmotiv of what I said, I would say that we were at war.  We had been aggressed (sic), and we did not have an armistice agreement whereby we could ensure public safety.  I have narrated before the Trial Chamber the steps we took in order to negotiate the cessation of hostilities, and we were not heard.  Now, between life and death, one always chooses to survive, which is what we were trying to do.  Thank you.  
Q.	Well, bearing in mind that you -- I take it from what you have said you accept having made similar statements in June.  Do you agree it's possible that you did make such statements in April, but have forgotten them?  Is that a possibility?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, in April, I think, in the first days to say how we were adapting, day by day, to the situation we -- into which we had been forced, I don't think at any point during that month on what occasion I would have said such words.  Because, one, young people whom I exhorted in June indeed were not trained and sent to the battle front as they were in June.  What creates some confusion in my mind, I don't see on what occasion I would have said such a thing.  
Q.	All right.  And do you recall having encouraged the youth to arrest all the deserting soldiers, to disarm them, and kill them?  Do you remember -- do you remember that?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  I did say so, and I admit it.  I said so at a time when soldiers were leaving positions to meld with the population, kill, steal, and run away.  Well, it was a situation that I tried to alert the responsable to.  I know that they tried to react against it, but disorder -- chaos was such that it was necessary to act within the population.  We had to resist all the looters.  I asked the population to resist them.  All those people who attacked their neighbours, civilians -- it was civilians, too.  And we had to attack, denounce, struggle against these people.  We couldn't accept that someone wearing a uniform could come and commit crimes among the citizenry.  That was the sense of that message.  I acknowledge it; I did say so.  
Q.	So the lack of judicial officers, which you've provided as a reason for one of the problems in dealing with the situation from April to July, didn't prevent you from asking the youth to arrest and kill mutineering soldiers without trial.  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I should like to tell you that I left Rwanda in July 1994 without having heard a single complaint from the government that the civilian population was committing massacres.  All those messages, you mustn't confuse them with the immediate resulting effect they could have among the citizenry.  But it was a way of denouncing excesses.  It would be very difficult for a civilian to attack an armed soldier, but it would not be difficult for two or three civilians to cry out and announce when they saw a soldier doing something.  But I didn't see a list of soldiers who would have been killed by the population.  These are things that I was saying to get the population to denounce those soldiers who were among them and committing crimes.  To call the population to witness was not a bad thing, a criminal thing, I think.  
Q.	Encouraging the youth to take the law into their own hands and kill deserting soldiers wasn't a bad thing as far as you're concerned; is that -- is that your evidence?  
A.	That is not what I have asserted, Mr. Prosecutor.  The population that -- in a town, the citizens of a town were not young people.  It was a mixture, young, old, men, women.  They didn't change their nature of the situation.  It was speaking of youth.  Maybe you're speaking of a specific organisation, a known structure to which I could speak.  But this was a message to the population at large.  The events were taking place among the citizenry, and I asked that the citizens should denounce those things happening.  That is all.  
(Pages 32 to 45 by Kirstin McLean)
















1530H 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	I would now ask the witness to be shown P. 47; it's in tab -- it's tab 1 of volume 2.  It's a transcript of Radio Rwanda.  I am going to be looking at page 3 in the English at the fifth paragraph.  And for my learned friends and for the Accused, it's in the French, it's page 5, the third paragraph.  And I am looking at the passage in the English which commences -- the sentence commencing, "As a matter of fact".  Do you have that?  Have you found that passage, Mr. Renzaho?  
A.	What page is that, Counsel?  
Q.	Page 5 of the French, and you will see the third paragraph has your name at the top of it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you see, in bold, your name, "Tharcisse Renzaho, préfet de la préfecture de la ville de Kigali  "  Have you found that, Mr. Renzaho, on page 5 of the French version?  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	It has a K number at the top, K0344810.  
A.	I have been assisted in finding that document, thank you.  
Q.	Now, the passage I am -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And now you need to find the right spot on that page.  Have you now found not only the title, but also the third line in the paragraph under your name starting with "en vérité..."?  First, in italics and bold, "Tharcisse Renzaho, then normal text, "en général', and then third line "en vérité...".  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good.  Here comes the question.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	In that paragraph, Mr. Renzaho, it's correct, isn't it, that you were thanking conseillers, bourgmestres, leaders of political parties and youth leaders, and you say in the last sentence in respect of that paragraph, "The meetings held have been useful for us because we were not going to be able to do anything whatsoever without their participation"? 
A.	Have I denied the fact that I asked the communal authorities to involve members of political parties?  What is here is true.  It was public awareness of the entire population.  That something had to be done, absolutely, to prevent killings in the population.  That is what I saw; and, as a matter of fact, we succeeded in maintaining some measure of calm, but the situation deteriorated again on account of the shelling.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Renzaho, the last sentence gives the impression that you held meetings with these groups.  That's the point.  
THE WITNESS:
I held my meetings at the Kigali city préfecture.  There were the refugees there, and everybody had access to those meetings.  UNAMIR officials stopped by from time to time, so I couldn't hold those meetings without the knowledge of those concerned.  That's what I am saying, and I am being truthful to myself and to you.  Thank you.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	So there were leaders of political parties around?  Is that right?  
A.	Political leaders were present at the communal level and possibly at the secteur level.  I don't know how political parties are structured and their structures within the population, but they had their structures within the communes and secteurs.  Thank you.  
Q.	All right.  I'll leave that for the moment, and I will ask you to be shown Prosecution Exhibit 63.  It's tab 17 of the second folder, radio transcripts from the 18th of June.  
MR. MOSES:
In the English, I'd ask Your Honours to look at page 5, the second paragraph.  And in French that's on page 6, the fourth paragraph.  

In French, it is page 6, the fourth paragraph, which commences in French (No interpretation). 
MR. PRESIDENT:
With other words, "I held a meeting".  
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, sir.  Yes.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	We'll be returning in a little bit more detail with what this meeting was about, Mr. Renzaho.  But, for the moment, I just want to highlight and ask you whether you agree that you were describing that you held a meeting with the leaders of these youths, and with the conseillers of the secteurs, and the leaders of cellule committees and with nyumba kumi; in short, everybody?  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I think I am kind of transposing myself into the situation for now.  You are showing me a document.  I have it here.  

But, sincerely, I am wondering, I don't know the dates on which a meeting was convened.  But what about the date?  I would like to see somebody who convenes a meeting of members, conseillers of communes, nyumba kumi, and the youth, and in a very exhaustive manner so as to not create problems, because if you invite members of the party and create problems.  So what was this meeting all about at the préfecture?  It is the principle of the whole thing that I doubt.  

Now, as to the documents I have said that a number of documents have been presented to me, but they have not been satisfactory to me because I have the impression that for one reason or the other something happened.  But I would like to explain to you:  Nyumba kumi means head of a ten-family unit; the head of cellule controls about 50 homes.  And for the stretch of the Nyarugenge commune that remained in our control, how could one convene such persons where -- what was the venue of the meeting?  Because, sincerely, I see huge obstacles, not only because the préfet had no precise framework to convene the nyumba kumi, heads of cellule, and all that, but also if it had to be done at the communal level, the préfet would attend; and in other areas we have noticed that during the period under consideration, any assembly was a fair target for firing, for attack.  So I don't know . But, personally, I had never attended such a major meeting that brought together almost the entire population, because when you get down to the level of nyumba kumi you are talking about the entire population.  Thanks.  
Q.	It might be that you would like to have a look at the full transcript of that statement of yours, Mr. Renzaho, from the 18th of June before, perhaps, tomorrow, because I will be coming back to it in respect of a different context.  And you may refresh your memory, particularly in respect to the comments you've made regarding the RPF attending Saint Paul's on the evening of the 17th.  That may help you to refresh your memory.  

Now, Mr. Renzaho, in your evidence in-chief -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I can see, Mr. Renzaho, that you want to say something, but that was just something the Prosecutor said, it doesn't call for a comment.  Whether you want to read a document overnight or not needs no follow-up in the courtroom.  Let's just take the next question, now.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Did I understand your testimony this morning that you did not accept the evidence of AFB in respect of the meeting he described you having with Mr. Kajuga and Mr. Rutiganda on the 10th of April; is that right?  You deny having attended such a meeting?  
A.	I denied it, Counsel.  
Q.	And did you know Mr. Rutiganda? 
A.	I met him at the UN detention facility.  He is there.  I know him.  
Q.	You haven't seen him ever before? 
A.	In Kigali, I tell you that I had never seen that person. 
Q.	So, he was not present at the SOPEYCA, S-O-P-E-Y-C-A on the 3rd of May.  Is that your evidence? 
A.	I have no knowledge whatsoever as to whether that person was present at SOPEYCA.  
Q.	And just one final question relating to, in general terms, the Interahamwe.  You have said that you were not a member of the MRND party.  Do you, at least, agree that you were a supporter of the MRND party?  
A.	Counsel, I am going to repeat this again.  I did not support any party, any political party.  I had no political ambition and I was not the supporter of any party.  Thank you.  
Q.	Well, it's just that you have heard from Prosecution witnesses saying that you clearly were.  One of your friends, I believe it was as a Defence witness, indicated that you were an MRND supporter.  
A.	Was he a civil servant who had lived with me or somebody who knew me very closely?  I cannot prevent people from having their opinions.  But those opinions in the context in which we found ourselves, was it correct in a society that was in the grip of mistrust, crying, suspicion?  So can we take the opinion of an individual to the effect that I belonged to a political party?  Did I attend any rally, any political party rallies?  What activities could I have undertaken to prove that I was a supporter or member of this or that political party?  

I would like to say that in 1992, for instance, the prime minister issued clear directives, and I do not know what I would have paid to continue to be a member of the MRND at the time when he was calling on state employees to desist from all those political activities.  That is a fact.  The document can be found.  Thank you.  
Q.	A final point on this matter -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please, commence again, we lost you.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	One final point of this issue of your relationship with the MRND.  I would ask you to be shown what Mr. Kambanda said about this, and it is on the document, side B, and in -- which is headed side B -- you may have -- do you have those in front of you Mr. Renzaho?  It is one of the documents that you were shown this morning.  
MR. MOSES: 
And for Your Honours, I am referring in the English to K0154893; and in the French, it's page 33.  It's a little difficult to read the whole K number on that document, but it appears that the last numbers are 48058.  
THE WITNESS:
I am sorry, I was absentminded, I did not follow the entire question and I can't actually answer.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Can you look at page 33 in the French? 
A.	I don't have that document, Counsel.  

Yes, I have it.  Please, would you put the question again?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is in relation to which paragraph on that page?  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Really commencing from the first line going down to about halfway down, where the initials "JK" are recorded as, "oui, oui,"  "yes, yes".  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you found it, Mr. Renzaho?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Here comes the question.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Do you agree with the comment of the prime minister that you were a member of the MRND?  Yes or no?  
A.	No -- (No interpretation). 
Q.	I think "no" is sufficient for the moment.  You have explained yourself previously.  

Do you see that the prime minister was asked whether there was not a rule that a member of the armed forces couldn't belong to a political party in Rwanda, and he indicated that it had been discussed at some point, he wasn't aware of such -- he didn't recall or was not aware of such a rule, but that the information he had was that, for Kigali, an exception had been made, and that it was an exception in which a soldier was being kept as préfet.  Once again, Mr. Renzaho, we really just need a comment as to whether you agree or not with that statement.  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I do not agree with that statement.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, we have dealt with the role that we say you were -- you had with the Interahamwe before and during the period of the genocide.  I now want to focus on -- briefly, on your activities and involvement with the Interahamwe after the end of the genocide.  

Now, you will recall that documents have been produced.  It's Prosecution Exhibit 103, relating to the formation of the RDR party in the Congo.  You remember those documents, don't you, Mr. Renzaho?  
A.	Yes, I knew of it here.  
Q.	Weren't you part of the umbrella committee of the RDR when it was formed in March 1995? 
A.	That is correct, and I see no crime in that. 
Q.	And that was the decision-making, politico-military organ of the RDR party, wasn't it?  
A.	I believe that can be true.  I don't have the full rules and regulations of the RDR with me.  It is not on the basis of that document that you can actually discuss the functioning of the RDR in full, because we need the statute thereof.  Thank you.  
Q.	And in that same document, it was decided, was it not, that the Interahamwe must not be a parallel force, but be recruited into the FAR?  That's what was decided, wasn't it?  
A.	I don't know.  I don't know how it was stated.  I don't have the references, for instance, the minutes of the meeting on that consideration.  All what I know is that the threats to which the refugees were exposed made it in such a way that they had to organise themselves to survive.  Thank you.  
Q.	And the FAR was to be the military wing of the RDR.  That was also decided, wasn't it?  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, if I had the minutes of that meeting I could say something.  I know that the RDR was an organisation that was set up for these hapless people who found themselves abroad, in a bid to get organised so as not to die.  In fact, things did not delay.  A short while after the camp was destroyed with shells and mortars, and people died before my eyes as (unintelligible). 
Q.	I was hoping I wouldn't have to have the document shown to you, but I think as a matter of -- as you have asked for it, it's Prosecution Exhibit 103, A is the French and B is the English.
MR. MOSES:
And, perhaps, whilst Madam Registrar is obtaining that, she could also take with her 104.
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, if you can please look at Exhibit 103A, which is the French, it's the page with K number 0 -- K0239677, it's the -- it's under 6A titled "les problèmes des Interahamwe"; in the English, Your Honours, it's on page 8 of the  English. 
A.	Yes, I can see point 6.  
Q.	Do you agree that it was decided that the Interahamwe was not to be a parallel force, but to be incorporated into the FAR? 
A.	That is what is written here, so it must be true.  So you also have to look at the circumstances that prevailed then.  People had weapons and were not part of any structure or known organisation, and these people indulged in criminal activities and actually bothered the refugees.  So, by some means, these persons had to be integrated into a structure that was recognised. That was it.  
Q.	And following paragraph 6B, it is recorded that the FAR was to be the military wing of the RDR, correct?  
A.	That is correct, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	And under the following paragraph, 6C, entitled "Le dossier genocide", it was to be the RDR policy to hold the RPF as mainly responsible for the massacres? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, the events speak for themselves -- the facts speak for themselves.  I think that any falsification sooner or later will appear in broad daylight to one and all.  

I don't understand what you are putting to me, if you say that at that time the RDR would have begun to imagine accusations or allegations against the RPF before the competent jurisdiction -- or the investigative historians can follow this up, but there are things that every Rwandan knows.  Who can hide that?  
Q.	And you signed on the 29th of April 1995, as a member of the FAR high command, a statement support for the RDR party, that's correct, isn't it?  
A.	Very certainly.  I see no crime in that.  
Q.	And the RDR did incorporate the Interahamwe into their ranks after the end of the genocide, didn't they --  formally? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I think that you won't find the solution with me.  All I can give you -- all I can say is that the RDR was an organisation trying to give hopes to the refugees, trying to organise them, first, not to die, and the threat being a direct one, because after September 1996, terrible things happened, and I witnessed them throughout in the forest, and what preceded that.  Now, if there are any guilty parties, I think that everyone has said that justice was free to find the guilty parties and punish them, but you are not going to forget that the title "Interahamwe," the term became collective.  All the Hutu are Interahamwe, if you didn't know that.  That is the political nuance.  

Now, really, everything that's hidden behind the term Interahamwe, is it guilty?  I don't agree.  It's -- to take a country and burn it down and say that the inhabitants committed crimes, then you would have a situation analogous to that of Original Sin, that someone committed a crime, and every descendant is a criminal.  So I don't know -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I have lost the speaker.  Is his microphone on?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Not any more.  Can you go on?  
MR. MOSES: 
Yes, Your Honour, we were nearly coming to the end.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Interpreter, can you please switch off your microphone?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, sir.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Now, it's your turn, Mr. Moses.  
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Do you agree with the description given to you in the ICG report of December 2000, which is Prosecution Exhibit 106, which names you as a leader of the -- named you as a leader of the Interahamwe in the Congo at that time?  That's just yes or no.  I don't need a lengthy description, whether you accept it or not.  
A.	Unfortunately, Mr. Prosecutor, my character is not that I answer yes or no.  This is an important question, but I will answer no.  
Q.	Because the reason we have put these documents in, Mr. Renzaho, is, I am suggesting to you, that you were leading and involved in the Interahamwe, not only before the genocide, not only during the genocide, but also after the genocide you had control over those persons who were taking part in the massacres of Tutsi civilians in Kigali and elsewhere in Rwanda during July -- April to July 1994.  Do you agree with that? 
A.	Absolutely not.  Absolutely not.  
Q.	All right.  We have now finished with that topic and we will move onto a new topic that has to be do with roadblocks.  

First of all, do you accept, Mr. Renzaho, that roadblocks were established throughout parts of Kigali within hours of the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	With the risk of disappointing you, yes, roadblocks existed.  They were regularly erected in Kigali.  It's true that on that day, after the announcement of the president's death, roadblocks were erected and the people who erected them were there around the CND,  and that very evening the RPF left their barracks and went among the citizenry and deaths ensued.  
Q.	Well, do you accept that other roadblocks were established in other parts of the city with persons whose intent was to target any Tutsi civilians who might pass through them? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I must tell you what my impressions were.  When the roadblocks were erected, I do not know when it began, and when I had the time to renew contact with the administrative authorities, the roadblocks were throughout the town, and I think that they proliferated with the development of the combat and the people who were fleeing from combat and going to more peaceful areas.  
Q.	Well, I will get back to my question:  Do you agree that roadblocks were set up for the purpose of targeting Tutsi civilians who might go through there? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I acknowledge that people at the roadblocks were treated in a brutal fashion, among them Tutsis; but in my humble opinion, I must acknowledge the truth of what happened at the time.  But I think that the people were not thinking of erecting roadblocks to await the Tutsi, because they lived with them in the neighbourhoods.  In our country, the people lived together.  In a village, you can have two Tutsi families and around Hutu families; they lived together.  So if there are problems, conflicts between the one and the other, they have to erect roadblocks to await people there?  

I think you are speaking of something that result -- the result of excesses that -- of something that was triggered the first days spontaneously by the people in view of the fighting, the immediate threat.  But excesses occurred, of course, and the people, instead of protecting each other, being responsible for each other, confused the attackers, the assailants, with everyone.  Perhaps, some even took advantage of the situation to aggress inoffensive people, merely because of the confusion.  And the people who were -- considered themselves special, were not well-intentioned, that's -- who considered themselves above the others, were not well-intentioned.  That's how I explain that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Renzaho, your answer now ran over 23 lines.  And even if the reality can be complicated, you must make an effort to answer quickly  because, you see, when you read now these 23 lines your point gets lost.  It's impossible to know whether you agree or disagree with the proposition.  
So, now, the Prosecutor will ask the question again and either you answer or you refrain from answering, but we must now get to the point in some of the answers.  Will you please help us?  Here comes the question again, really.
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Were roadblocks set up in Kigali by persons for the purpose of targeting Tutsi, in your opinion?  Yes or no? 
A.	I was not with them.  I don't know.  
Q.	And in your previous answer, you were referring to excesses that took place at the roadblocks.  That's doublespeak for killing, isn't it, Mr. Renzaho?  
A.	Brutalities committed at the roadblocks was not only killing; people were -- had their money taken away from them, people were beaten and then allowed to go on their way.  There were all sorts of wrong deeds.  That is why I spoke of quite criminal conduct.  But it wasn't only killing.  
Q.	When did you become aware, according to you, Mr. Renzaho, that some people were using roadblocks to kill Tutsis at the roadblocks? 
A.	That question was put to me in the morning -- or maybe it was yesterday.  I answered in saying that I learned of the phenomenon after the 10th -- after the 10th of April.  
Q.	You would agree with me, Mr. Renzaho, that there would be nothing wrong, of itself, in either setting up roadblocks or distributing weapons in a time of armed conflict?  Do you agree with that proposition?  
A.	Well, a country that is attacked has the right to defend itself, I think.  And what you have just suggested could happen, if it isn't concealing a crime.
Q.	There would have been something wrong, however, wouldn't there, Mr. Renzaho, in asking for roadblocks to be established and distributing weapons at a point in time when you were in -- when the person was aware that such items and such things as roadblocks were being used by civilians to kill innocent Tutsi civilians?  You will also agree with me on that?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I tell you that anyone who was -- had such notions should, first of all, take care of preliminaries, which is to say to give the order for such roadblocks to be erected and then distribute weapons.  Roadblocks with the mission to kill and then to distribute weapons, yes, indeed, it would be most criminal.  Was that the case in Rwanda?  
Q.	We will come to that in a minute.  

Now, you will agree with me, also, won't you, Mr. Renzaho, that the Tutsi, in general, were referred to, both by yourselves and others on the radio, as "Inyenzi-Inkotanyi"?  
A.	It wasn't I who invented the expression.  It was adopted after the start of the RPF war,  and I think the illusion was clear:  Those who were attacking at that time were the same that had attacked in the 60s; thus, there was a heightened -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness's microphone has gone off.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Renzaho, you have to answer the question.  Did you use that term, yes or no, in that way?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I used it, as others used it.
MR. MOSES:
Yes, and, in that respect, I would ask the trial -- my learned -- that the witness be shown Prosecution Exhibit 57, which is under tab 11, English page 21, third paragraph; the French is page 25, fourth paragraph.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Tab in which folder?  
MR. MOSES: 
Sorry, second folder, it's radio transcripts.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, could you please repeat the page references?  
MR. MOSES: 
The English page is page 21, third paragraph, and the sentence I am looking at is -- commences -- it starts with "Moreover, the people" to the end of that paragraph.  And in the French, it's page 25, the fourth paragraph.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, this is a Radio Rwanda transcript.  In the same transcript there is an interview with you, and it is followed by an interview with Mr. Rwajekare, R-W-A-J-E-K-A-R-E.  And on the radio station that you were broadcasting about Inyenzi-Inkotanyi, Mr. Rwajekare was telling people that there is only one problem now, the problem between the Hutu and the Tutsi.  He went on to say that this is not a war between political parties, for the time being, the general problem is to fight against the Inyenzi-Inkotanyi, against the Tutsi.  

Now, Mr. Renzaho, clearly for those persons listening to you, they understood, didn't they, that Inyenzi-Inkotanyi referred to all Tutsi?  
A.	You are referring to a gentleman whom I don't know, and what he says commits himself.  He is not one of my civil servants whom I had ordered to go and say things on the radio.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What you read out now was Mr. Rwajekare's statement?  
MR. MOSES: 
Absolutely.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	I won't -- there is another similar statement, and I won't go through doing that, but that's on page 22, the second paragraph of the English, and in the French, page 27, second paragraph, where Mr. Rwajekare was telling the listeners of Radio Rwanda that the Inyenzi -- 
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I am making an objection because I don't really see, unless we go to the once, or twice or thrice removed, how can you ascribe to Mr. Renzaho what someone who is not part of his administrative staff, who is not in the indictment -- if you go into this sort of thing it's going to take a lot of time.  But I don't see why you mention this person with whom Mr. Renzaho was -- had no relations and for whom he is not responsible.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You did draw our attention to this paragraph on 5th March 2006; we are aware of them.  But what does that assist us --  in what way in relation to the views of the Accused?  
MR. MOSES: 
Well, Your Honours, clearly as the préfet, who is using those terms on the radio, it's of interest, in the Prosecution's submission, as to what meanings those -- that term meant.  And it is our submission that, clearly, it referred to all Tutsi, and that was the message that was going out to the people.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	So, my question for you, having seen that statement which was on Radio Rwanda, where you were regularly reporting, is that the people who were listening to you would have clearly understood that when you referred to: "Inyenzi-Inkotanyi", you were referring to Tutsi.  Because that's the message that was going out on the radio, isn't it, Mr. Renzaho? 
A.	That is not the message that was being put over Radio Rwanda.  And if you go through the communiqués that I made, I even occasionally asked the people to be extremely careful in what they were doing, so as not to confuse the RPF fighter with the rest of the Tutsi population that lived with them.  And there is many of those messages, communiqués, so I do not agree with what is asserted here.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Renzaho, I am suggesting to you that you never, never said on the radio that people should not kill Tutsis simply on the basis of their ethnicity.  You, as préfet, never sent that message out, did you?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, would you give me a little time just to collect my communiqués and show them to you?  Perhaps not in the present -- at the present sitting, but I will show them to you. 
(Pages 46 to 56 by Judith Baverstock)








1630H
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, Mr. Renzaho, you told us in the course of your evidence-in-chief that you had not requested roadblocks to be established; that's your evidence, isn't it? 
A.	I was not the one who gave the order for the roadblocks to be erected. 
Q.	I'm going to read you an extract from Prosecution Exhibit 50.  It is under tab 4 from the 12th of April, and it's -- I think it's only in English, page 9.  

Madam Registrar, I'll try and deal with it by reading the passage out.  If the witness does not accept 
my -- 

This was a passage that was referred to briefly in your evidence-in-chief.  And you are quoted here as saying on the 12th of April -- from line 4 -- at line 2: "We request of them to make patrols within their quarters like usual.  They ought to come together and look for their traditional tools they are used to and defend themselves.  I should like to request of them now, each quarter should try and organise itself and make a communal work within quarters by cutting off branches, searching empty houses, check out in the nearby swamp that no Inyenzi hid there.  They ought to do this so they get the hope that nobody is hidden inside.  They must cut those branches, check in gutters and houses overgrown with weeds.  Then at night they have to be watchful so they find nobody inside houses and kill him or something else.  People must come together within quarters.  On the streets leading to their quarters, it would be a good thing to block them with roadblocks.  They can look after them, choose people they really trust and who have papers and put them there."   

That is on the 12th April, after the date that you say it was apparent to you that Tutsis were being killed at roadblocks.  And you're asking the people to set up roadblocks, telling them it would be a good thing, isn't that right? 
A.	Counsel, I will answer you.  I would not change from what I said before.  At that time we had requirements.  First, there was the requirements of the war that was still raging on.  And on the 12th, Kigali was completely surrounded.  There is a UNAMIR report that attests to that.  And then the government left Kigali on account of the insecurity.  

The second thing is the erection of roadblocks, and those roadblocks existed before.  Do not forget that on the 10th I'd sent out a message asking for the population to abolish these roadblocks during the day.  But the message did not go across because the problems persisted and the war continued and I had no cause to fight with those who were manning the roadblocks.  

So to claim that I asked the population to erect roadblocks on the 12th is not correct, because the entire city was covered with roadblocks.  But I mentioned vigilance because the surrounding -- the incursion of aggressive troops meant that the threat was getting right down to the timing about those that remained and that still had not been attacked.  

So, I will not get into the technical details of the fighting, but it could happen if infiltrated persons, through street fighting, could get into houses that were uninhabited and -- 
Q.	I am going to stop you.  But my question was about the erection of roadblocks.  In the passage that I've read you, you were telling the population that it would be a good thing to set up roadblocks, isn't that right?  That is what you told the population on the 12th of April.  
A.	I'll repeat, Counsel, that roadblocks existed before. 
Q.	I'll repeat my question.  Isn't it correct that you were telling the population on the 12th of April that it would be a good thing for them to establish roadblocks? 
A.	What you read there is correct, but those roadblocks existed. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did those roadblocks exist from the 6th to the 12th?  Or was it the situation that there had been roadblocks in the past?  What did you mean by the sentence:  "But these roadblocks existed"?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, we are talking about the period of the attack and the RPF offensive.  So roadblocks were set up as from the night of the 6th to the 7th.  And then it spread, and they were spread all over the city up until the 12th. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Maitre Cantier?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I would like to raise an objection, because I have here the text to which counsel for the Prosecution is referring.  And it was repeated two or three times that in that text Mr. Renzaho called for the setting up of roadblocks.  

That text is in English, but my English is not best.  But I don't see it written in the text -- in the text that the counsel for the Prosecution is citing. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you have the English version in front of you now?  Do you see the sentence starting with 
"on the streets"?  
MR. CANTIER: 
I'm sorry, what line is that?  I have the English version here, the first page. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We are on page 9 and we are at line 10:  "On the streets leading", the end of that sentence, what do you think about that formulation?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, well, maybe you should put that to Mr. Renzaho.  I am looking at the precise reference that was cited by the counsel for the Prosecution to carry on the discussion.  But I can't take the place of Mr. Renzaho to answer that question.  But if you want --
MR. PRESIDENT:  
You are saying:  What is the basis for Mr. Moses saying so?  And I'm saying I think actually if you read the last part of that sentence, that's the one, but in order to be a bit diplomatic instead of saying: "Isn't it there?", I said,  "What did you think about it?"   
MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. President, for your concern in my regard. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you want to proceed, Mr. Moses?  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	You see that statement on the 12th of April, Mr. Renzaho, is consistent with what Prosecution witnesses have said what you were asking them to do in their secteurs at around that same period of time, isn't it?  It's corroborative of what the Prosecution witnesses say you were telling them to do, which was to set up roadblocks in their secteurs? 
A.	Well, I will repeat what I said:  To my mind, that is the reality of what I saw.  The roadblocks were there, they existed all through the city. 
Q.	You didn't have any problem with the roadblocks, is that what you're telling us?  There was no difficulty so far as you were concerned with roadblocks existing? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I have been sitting in front of the Chamber for close to a week now, and I have discussed security issues at length, security issues that we faced, and not once do I recall saying what you are ascribing to me.  Thank you. 
Q.	So, you didn't think it was a good thing to have roadblocks; yes or no? 
A.	Counsel, while we -- it was important to be concerned with the security issue, but the extension of the security concern was the protection of people because the whole thing was getting widespread.  We had troops that had taken defensive positions out of the city on the hills to face the RPF, far away then. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I'm not talking about fighting the RPF in the hills far away.  I'm asking you whether you thought it was a good thing that persons were manning these roadblocks erected around Kigali from the 10th of April onwards; was that something that you wanted to happen? 
A.	I simply called on the population to be vigilant and I asked them to do that because there were incursions and the attacks were coming into the mechanism.  That is all.  There is a UNAMIR report that talks about the situation.  You could read that.  The report is very exhaustive in that connection. 
Q.	On the 14th of April, and it's P. 51, tab 5, English, page 10, and about five or six lines from the bottom; and in French it is page 24, fourth paragraph.  I'll read from the English, and then if you disagree or have any problems with it, Mr. Renzaho, we can point you to it.  
You say to the population:  "So we will hold meetings tomorrow and I asked the citizens, especially those intuitions that they have to come for.  All the citizens do not have to attend those meetings because the citizens have to conduct patrols and have their roadblocks that they are guarding at which they must remain."  

You're telling the population for persons to stay on the roadblocks on the 14th of April, aren't you, 
Mr. Renzaho? 
A.	That is correct.  And on the 8th, I asked the commune authorities to take control of the situation that prevailed in the commune, and that is quite correct. 
Q.	So as far as you are concerned, you were wanting people to man the roadblocks? 
A.	The population exposed to the war front, spontaneously set up the roadblocks and were manning them already. 
Q.	With the greatest of respect, Mr. Renzaho, that does not answer my question.  You were happy in wanting people to man those roadblocks on the 14th of April, weren't you? 
A.	What else did they have to protect themselves?  In as much as people were exposed to the firing and the incursions of the troops that were attacking them, and the danger was there.  Those roadblocks, even though they just started spontaneously, they were there.  And it was a reality on which I had to count.  I had no means of security or guaranteeing their security.  There was no way of abolishing those roadblocks.  

So, first, we had to look at those who exercised authority at those roadblocks, but it didn't work and the roadblocks remained, and they had to be managed somehow and they were managed at the level of the various neighbourhoods and the population -- I believe we had a witness here, HIN, who told us how the people relayed one another at the roadblocks.  Thank you. 
Q.	That was at a time when you knew that those same roadblocks were being used to target Tutsi, it was after the 10th of April? 
A.	Am I forbidden from asking a question?  I was going to ask you -- ask you for advice on what I would have done. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now your question, Mr. Moses.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	You gave instructions to persons manning those roadblocks on what documents they should check for persons going through, didn't you? 
A.	Yes, I had a discussion with a journalist and I believe we addressed that issue. 
Q.	And you were instructing the population to check persons' identity cards.  And that they also needed laissez-passers, isn't that correct? 
A.	The laissez-passers were delivered under circumstances that I tried to explain here.  I do not think that it constituted a problem.  All the more so, as the people who passed by had laissez-passers to continue within the country.  So, generally, people who would pass by with laissez-passers were heading for the interior of the country. 
Q.	Laissez-passers didn't record the ethnicity of the person, did they? 
A.	That is what we did. 
Q.	Identity cards did indicate the ethnicity of people, didn't they? 
A.	That was the law.  I couldn't change it, well, unless law was reviewed. 
Q.	But you knew that people with Tutsi identity cards were having excesses delivered to them at roadblocks, didn't you? 
A.	I did not quite understand that question. 
Q.	I'm sorry, I used a term you had.  Tutsis were being killed at roadblocks and they were being identified because they were having to show identity cards with their ethnicity on them; correct? 
A.	I don't know at my level whether the documents I gave out were intended to have those people travel to their various destinations.  Now, the identity papers they had were theirs.  But I must say that many of them discarded them, and we've had witnesses here who have said that they found documents saying that those papers were lost.  But I did not have the power to replace official documents that was delivered to citizens.  What could I do?  
Q.	For now could you answer my question, please, Mr. Renzaho?  Were you aware -- or you were aware, weren't you, that Tutsis were having -- being killed at roadblocks because they were showing their identity cards showing that they were Tutsi.  That was common knowledge? 
A.	That's true, even without seeking to check the identity card, the persons have declared before this Chamber that faces that resembled those of Tutsis faced problems, people who had such faces. 
Q.	Not just people with faces, Mr. Renzaho, people who had identity documents showing their ethnicity; that's also true, isn't it? 
A.	I believe that what you're saying is correct.  If a person had an identity card that could be checked, and in addition to that, somebody could -- somebody's facial features could reveal that they were Tutsi.  That's the reality that we experienced. 
Q.	Yet you made it a requirement and gave instructions to those persons at the roadblocks, that persons needed to show their identity cards? 
A.	There are ways of operation at roadblocks and documents are always checked, whether I say so or not.  It's the same thing.  And maybe the crime here would be to say that these persons who have this status should be brutalised.  I believe Rwandans have always had identity cards and roadblocks were not restricted to the period between April and July 1994.  Throughout the war, we have been used to the phenomenon of roadblocks and people have always passed without problems.  Perhaps we should wonder -- ask ourselves why people carry on like this. 
MR. MOSES:
I note the time, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You remember this earthquake meeting?  The problem is that it might be argued that it would be good for staff to be present when it comes to matters like that.  And that, unfortunately, could slow us down.  

Where are you in your cross-examination now?  I note that you are at P. 51.  I'm wondering whether we should carry on a bit longer today in order to make up for the meeting tomorrow.  

Before doing so, do you have an estimate based on the rhythm so far?  Let's assume that we sit tomorrow from 8:45 to 10:20, and then there will be a need probably for some of Monday.  Or what is your estimate?  
MR. MOSES:
Yes, Your Honours, it hasn't been as fast as I'd anticipated, it's fair to say.  I've gone through perhaps -- or will certainly have by a little bit longer, a third of the questions.  I think the last third will not -- will be a lot quicker.  So I'm certainly expecting to finish on Monday.  It may not be till Monday afternoon, but it will be on Monday. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
When will Mr. Lugan start his testimony, Defence?  From when is he ready?  And did you mention approximately four hours for him?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, what we planned was to start on Monday in the afternoon with Professor Lugan, and the estimated time was five or six hours. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And then we have the voir dire of about one hour plus additional time, so that means that Lugan will take more than a day for the two parties. 
MR. MOSES:
Your Honours, two issues there:  One, I think the voir dire will be perhaps 40, 45 minutes.  But that will in fact include most of the questions that I intend to ask Mr. Lugan, should he be qualified.  

If Your Honours do qualify him, and my approach in general terms if he is qualified -- my approach would then be to say his statement can go on and I'd be then happy to cross-examine him on the statement.  I've certainly not been advised that there are additional material that my learned friend wishes to extract from Mr. Lugan, other than that in his statement.  But perhaps, should Your Honours qualify him, it is a way in which matters could be sped up.  If that assists the Trial Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Maitre Cantier, will there be additional documents coming up with regard Professor Lugan's testimony?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Let me consult a bit before answering you.
Yes, Mr. President.  There are two or three documents that we hoped to use, but these documents have already been disclosed.  They are part of the batch of documents that we've disclosed.  They are not new documents. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What we have heard so far seems to indicate we have control over the segment.  But why don't we continue for a little while and we'll see how this develops, Mr. Moses.  It won't be too long. 
MR. MOSES:
I'll see if I can locate the last question, Your Honour. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, from what I understand from your testimony, do you we understand that roadblocks were established to locate "infiltrators"? 
A.	I tell you how I saw the situation.  Those who erected the roadblocks feared that assailants would come to their place and kill without any warning, without any alert for those who can run or for those who could obtain the intervention of the force -- security forces, because the RPF had taken -- Rwandan government forces had taken up positions around the neighbourhoods.  I think that was the fear in people's minds. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, just the last passage that I read you from the 14th of April, you were telling people to be on the roadblocks.  Why were you telling them to do that? 
A.	Quite simply because the day I said that the town was completely encircled and the troops coming from the north began to come into the town directly, the north, northwest.  That was the reality of the moment. 
Q.	Weren't you -- I'm sorry.  I'll rephrase that question.  Were you aware of any person who was arrested for being an infiltrator in any of the roadblocks set up in Kigali?  Because you'll agree I don't believe that we've heard of any such person being arrested during April to July? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, what we are telling you is not the fruit of imagination.  I've even read in your archives here transcripts of Radio Rwanda where there were interviews of APR soldiers who'd been arrested in Gimiramiya (phonetic) secteur, and we spoke of others.  And to be even more explicit, and to be concrete, I can mention a series of raids that were made within the FAR lines, RGF lines.  They went -- paratroopers dropped where they wanted to attack.  There was infiltrators to the open areas, that's how it is done.  And there's also cases of soldiers questioned by military intelligence.  Intelligence -- if there is transcriptions, I can find them. 
Q.	How many alleged infiltrators were arrested by those civilians manning those -- those civilians manning the barriers in your préfecture, Mr. Renzaho? 
A.	I did not have any mechanism for picking up those people that were stopped.  There was an RGF line of defence around the neighbourhood and if people were arrested they'd be taken to those soldiers.  We did not have a central mechanism at the préfecture to collect those people. 
Q.	So the answer is:  None.  You are not aware of any people arrested by civilians at roadblocks. 
A.	I did not receive any such persons at the préfecture. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It seems to me this is a good moment to stop and we will then continue tomorrow morning at 8:45.  The court is adjourned.  
(Court adjourned at 1711H)
