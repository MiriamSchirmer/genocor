MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  The Court is in session.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness and will be referred to as Witness GLJ in these proceedings.  You have to tell the truth and the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
(Declaration made by Witness GLJ in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have a document in front of you with your signature, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the information in this document is correct; is that so?  
THE WITNESS:
That's correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Matemanga?

MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecution?  

Good morning, Defence.  
MR. CANTIER:
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.  

Mr. President, simple point:  You had mentioned the possibility of us dealing this morning with the issue of the Prosecution disclosure of the CD.  I thought we would do so this morning.  There are certain comments I would like to make, more so because I have other comments to make regarding will-says which were disclosed to us on the 17th of January, that is, last week, and one of which will-say concerns this same witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I assume that the CD refers to a witness we have already heard, is that so?  Or is it a general question?  
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President. It is the issue of admissibility of that evidence, which you have already pointed to, and your Chamber has not yet made a determination on that.  So that question is still pending.  More so, because with this new witness we have received a will-say and the Prosecutor intends to examine him also on that document.  So it is the view of the Defence that now is the time to sort that matter out.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We will certainly wish to hear you now on this issue of the will-say of the witness in front of us, and then we can postpone other practical issues that are not linked to this witness.  In this way, we will make sure that the testimony of the present witness proceeds in an organised way without losing time with other matters which we may postpone to a bit later.  What do you want to address us on concerning the will-say?  Please proceed.   
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, it all starts with the production by the Prosecutor of the audio cassette or CD during the court session of the 11th of January 2007.  And I am making the linkage, because the issue of the will-say concerning that witness also has to do with that cassette or tape.  Mr. President, Your Honours, we are seeking to secure that that particular bit of evidence be excluded, as well as exclusion of that will-say regarding that witness, as well as for the other witness concerning whom a will-say has been disclosed to us, also.  So Mr. President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just to make sure that the Bench understands what is going on now.  You are referring to a will-say.  In other trials, we are usually provided with copies of such will-says so that we know what kind of will-says we are talking about.  We have no idea -- I see, we have received a written document.  You are referring to the 17th of January 2007.  And I note that the Prosecution has indeed conveyed this to everyone, it was just a matter of identifying the document.  We have it in front of us.  

Now, this document we have here in written form contains references to six will-say letters; two of them refer to GLJ.  They are of the same date and probably, then, the same document.  So it's the first one in that document you are referring to?  You are referring to the will-say statement of 17th January 2007.  
MR. CONSTANT: 
That is correct.  But I am sorry, Mr. President, since this does not concern the witness directly, could we ask him to take off his headset, because we are dealing with legal issues here.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, do you speak French?  I suppose you do.  

THE WITNESS:
No, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Not at all, being a Rwandan?  
THE WITNESS:
True, I can hear a few words of French, but I don't speak French.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it a point for the Defence that this discussion should take place without the witness knowing of the discussion?  With other words, not only a matter of this not directly linked to his evidence, but also what he should know of before he starts giving his testimony?  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, the discussion concerns this witness, but also other witnesses.  So I think that for purposes of sincerity in his statement, it is preferable that he doesn't take part in our discussions by listening to what we are saying.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Could you just take off your headset a little bit, Mr. Witness, and then we will proceed without asking you to leave the courtroom, then.  

What's the point, Defence, please?  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, we are talking about the will-say regarding this witness.  But the discussions also concern the other will-says which were disclosed to us on the 17th of January referring to two other witnesses, and the discussion also concerns a witness who has already appeared before this Court.  And the discussion actually stems from the CD disclosed to us during the hearing of the 11th of January 2007, and which was put to Witness ALG at that time.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, our prayer is that that piece of evidence be excluded for the following reasons which I am going to summarise:  Firstly, with regard to form, Mr. President, Your Honours, that document was not disclosed to us within the regular time frames, whereas apparently the Prosecutor and his investigators had been in possession of the document a long time ago, as was disclosed to us by a witness; and Defence (sic) counsel did not give the name or pseudonym of the witness.  

Mr. President, I am sorry, I am having problems with my earphones.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We now heard you say that this document was not disclosed timely.  Which exhibit or document are you referring to now?  

MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I am talking about the audio medium which we listened to during the court session of the 11th of January.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And do you understand the communication problem, because your word "pièce à conviction" was translated as document?  That's why we didn't understand it.  But, now, we are on the same wavelength.  You are referring to the tape, the audio.  Yes, please go ahead.  
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  There are several problems raised by the production of that document.  Whereas the Prosecution had that document a long time ago, especially its investigators, as was explained to us by the witness during the court session of the 9th of January, we got that information only when ALG testified on the 11th of January.  So we think that the delay in the disclosure should lead to the exclusion of that particular piece of evidence.  

Secondly, Mr. President, that exhibit is, for the Prosecutor, a new charge or allegation -- or accusation against Mr. Renzaho.  If you read the entire document, Mr. President, Your Honours, as it was disclosed to us -- because it is essential to know the grounds for my objection -- the Defence received a disclosure only of written material.  So we were surprised during the court session of 11th January when that particular tape was played and a witness was requested to recognise Mr. Renzaho's voice.  It came as a total surprise to us, Mr. President, Your Honours.  We had read the documents disclosed to us and which were entered into evidence, and the terms of which you know.  In that document, Mr. Renzaho's name was not mentioned.  Actually, the Prosecutor wanted to demonstrate that in that document, where there is no reference to Mr. Renzaho's name, it is possible to recognise Mr. Renzaho's voice.  

But, Mr. President, Your Honours, what is the evidence?  It is not the written document any longer, it is actually the CD.  Yet, the conversation in that document concerns events or facts which do not appear in the indictment.  And if I properly understood it, because it was not clear, it concerns a battle which took place within the territory of Kigali-rural.  If I remember properly it was Bicumbi. And in the course of that battle, there was some conversations, and in the conversations some words were used.  And now the Prosecutor wants to make use of those words.  So, Mr. President, Your Honours, these are not only new accusations, but they actually are new accusations which do not appear in the indictment.  

To be more specific, you see, Mr. President, Your Honours, we were surprised and we tried to make sense out of what was going on.  Of course, we had to go and reread the indictment.  We had to go and reread the pretrial brief.  And on page 21 of the French version of the pretrial brief -- and to be more specific with you, it is point 89 of the pretrial brief.  Point 89(a) of the pretrial brief --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So this is not in the indictment, but in the pretrial brief?  
MR. CANTIER:
Absolutely, Mr. President, the Prosecution brief.  And I was not able to locate any mention of those events.  And the first reference I discovered is through what is written in the pretrial brief, and I am going to quote.  The Accused talked about extermination in a telephone conversation with Mr. Rugambarara, the bourgmestre of Bicumbi, and which was intercepted.  

Now, Mr. President, Your Honours, what is the position of the Defence? The Defence discovers in this document disclosed to it, if my memory serves me correctly, during the session of the 6th of December, and in that document we see clearly that it is a conversation, a telephone conversation.  But we are not certain about it, and I am going to come back to this.  But we realise that in that conversation Mr. Renzaho does not feature; only the name of Mr. Karera, the préfet of Kigali-rural was mentioned.  So, Mr. President, Your Honours, the Defence earnestly thinks that it was a mistake, and we didn't go further.  

And, Mr. President, I would like to insist on this point, and I will look at the document which, in English, is 21, that is, the much-talked about telephone intercept.  You will find out in that intercept, and I highlighted a number of things:  Firstly, the person placing the call actually tries to reach Mr. Karera.  The person placing the call is Mr. Rugambarara.  And, Mr. President, Your Honours, in order to enable you to follow closely, I would like to refer to that intercept; it is K0167847, the beginning of the conversation concerning the préfet.  In the French version, K0167847.  And in the transcription of the conversation, what you can read is that Mr. Rugambarara, who apparently was the one who placed the call, says as follows:  "Now put me through to the préfet".  Then, further down, the speaker, Mr. Rugambarara, says, "Mr. Préfet," and the next speaker, Préfet Karera, who says, "Yes, good morning" -- - or "Good day".  And throughout that written transcription, Mr. President, Your Honours, it is only Mr. François Karera who features.  Accordingly, Mr. President, Your Honours, for the Prosecutor, if he enables us to understand what he wants to do, what actually was of interest to him was not the transcript, it was the audiotape in which he tries to make the witness recognise Mr. Renzaho's voice.

Mr. President, Your Honours, I am going to summarise in a word or two what I just said.  Firstly, it is a new accusation, which does not feature in the indictment.  Consequently, that new accusation should be excluded pursuant to Article 20 of the Statute, and also of Article 17 of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, because, so far, it has not been made known to Mr. Renzaho, whereas he has been arrested since 2002.  

Secondly, that piece of evidence, the audio document, must be excluded because it is not there to buttress any charge which is in the indictment; and, furthermore, it was disclosed late.  That is my submission, Mr. President, Your Honours, regarding that audio evidence.  I wanted to start with that because the will-says which we are talking about are a follow-up to that question.  

Once again, Mr. President, Your Honours, and in order to end regarding this piece of evidence which the Prosecutor is introducing belatedly for us, it is fundamentally intrinsically inadmissible and it cannot be allowed.  And that is pursuant to Rule 95 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, the trial concerns evidence.  And, in the trials in this Tribunal, I can even say more:  It is up to the Court to ensure the sincerity and reliability of the evidence adduced before it.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, last week we tried to understand what was the nature of that audio document.  Was it a transcription of a radio broadcast?  I am saying so because why did we think about it?  We thought that was a possibility because one could hear music being played.  And I reread what my learned friend Moses told us.  He told us, "No, it was a telephone intercept, and you can look at the transcripts, Mr. President, Your Honours, that is what you will find."  As far as I know, a radio broadcast is different from a telephone intercept.  If it is a telephone intercept, your Court is no doubt aware that it is a manner of proceeding for investigators, who in national laws are strictly regulated.  And, in this connection, there is established case law in the European Court of Human Rights.  But even closer to us -- closer to you, we have statement of the United Nations human rights committee, a statement dated 1999 in the matter concerning Mr. Antonius Cornelius van Hulst  of the Netherlands.  And the human rights committee, in its statement, underscored that in order to fulfil the requirements of Article 17 of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights a telephone recording must fulfil several criteria:  It must be lawful; it must conform with the provisions of the covenant; and it must also relate to the matter at hand.  Mr. President, you even put the question to Witness NAB regarding the circumstances under which he obtained that document.  I have gone through the transcript again.  And he obtained them through the Rwandan ministry of rehabilitation in 1996 or 1997.  That is the origin of the document.  


Mr. President, Your Honours, we know nothing concerning the lawful or legal and material conditions under which that telephone intercept was made and in which that tape was subsequently preserved before it was handed to investigators of the ICTR.  Your Court knows how easy it is today to doctor such documents.  That is something which even a teenager can do.  We are not suspecting investigators of the ICTR of having done such a doctoring exercise.  But it is essential for us, and for you, to know how the intercept was made.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, we do not even have the telephone number -- the number of the telephone which was intercepted.  Consequently, we cannot even know who owned that telephone line.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, there is established case law in this Tribunal about that, that evidence must fulfil several qualities:   Legal integrity, moral integrity, physical integrity -- and that is what I am talking about right now regarding that document.  

Lastly, Mr. President, Your Honours, I note, and I would like you also to note that the document is being put to four witnesses for purposes of recognition.  And there are two things which are common to the four witnesses, as you will realise when you see the other witnesses:  Firstly, they have been charged before Rwandan courts; and, secondly, they were in the administrative unit, which Mr. Renzaho handled.  It is for those reasons that I am asking you, not only to exclude that evidence, that is, the audio CD, but also to exclude the testimony of Witness ALG regarding that document, because as we have understood, you have not yet made a determination regarding the document; thirdly, to exclude the will-say regarding this witness and next two witnesses, which, by rote, I believe are BUO and AWE.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maître, you referred to the covenant, and I heard you say both in French and also in the English translation, article 17, but you meant article 14, didn't you?  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I stand corrected by you.  Indeed, that was actually speaking off-the-cuff.  It is the article relating to the right to privacy and concerning intercepts, and I believe I also mentioned the covenant regarding the right for each Accused to be aware of all the accusations against him within a reasonable time frames.  That one is article 14.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I see, so you are actually making a reference, both to article 14 concerning fair trial rights, and article 17 concerning right to privacy.  That is noted.  Then you kindly drew our attention to either an admissibility decision or views by the human rights committee.  Could you give us a copy of that case, please?  
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, we are having it printed and then we shall forward it to you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we would wish a copy to the Bench and to the court reporters and the translators, please.  Thank you for that.  

Mr. Witness, can you hear me now?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What's going on now is a procedural discussion about admissibility of documents.  This is not necessarily related to your testimony.  So we would ask you to bear with us, and we will now hear the Prosecution's submissions on the same matters.  So, please, be patient.  Take off your headset again and we will soon start your testimony.  All right?  
THE WITNESS:
Very well, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Moses.  
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honours.  I will try and be relatively brief because I know we have discussed this issue previously and I don't want to repeat things at length.  Firstly, can I make it quite clear that I agree with my friend that it is not in the indictment, and therefore we will not be asking for Your Honours to convict the Accused for this alleged incident and anything said therein.  The purpose of it was made quite clear in our pretrial brief, which was filed, Your Honours, on the 31st of October 2005, some almost 15 months ago, when we advised the Defence that we intended to lead evidence of the Accused talking of extermination during an intercepted telephone conversation with the bourgmestre of Bicumbi, Mr. Rugambarara, and that the purpose of that was as evidence of intent, which is quite a separate issue to its being an issue contained in the indictment for which we can require or ask for a conviction.  It is proof of intent.  

Your Honours, I note my friend hasn't referred to any decisions of this Court or of our Appeals Court.  I would briefly refer Your Honour to the Appeals Court decision of Ntahobali and Nyiramasuhuko, decision of the 2nd of July 2004 by -- issued by Judge Shahabuddeen.  That was an interlocutory appeal regarding evidence which had been admitted by the Trial Chamber, which had not been contained in the indictment, regarding one of the Accused presence at a speech, which was being led by the Prosecution to be inflammatory.  And His Honour said, in paragraph 13 of that decision that:

"As Nyiramasuhuko has not been charged in the indictment for her presence at the installation of the person, there can be no conviction in respect of her attendance at that meeting.  However, whilst it may be the case that her presence" -- and I am not reading fully, but I hope -- "it may be the case that the allegation of Witness RV in relation to Nyiramasuhuko's presence at the installation of Ndayambaje in Muganza commune is not specifically pleaded in the indictment, this alone does not render the evidence inadmissible.  Indeed, pursuant to Rule 89(C) of the rules, the Trial Chamber may admit any relevant evidence which it deems to have probative value.  It should be recalled that the admissibility of evidence should not be confused with the assessment of the weight to be afforded to that evidence, an issue to be decided by the Trial Chamber after hearing the totality of the evidence."  
Now, I note from my friend's submission I certainly didn't hear that the Accused was denying it was him; and, in fact, it appears that perhaps he may have an explanation this it was in the context of a battle that such words were spoken.  But that is a matter which Your Honour may hear from the Accused, if he so chooses to testify.  And, at the end of the day, if Your Honour or Your Honours are of the opinion that it is, in fact, the accused who is speaking on that tape, Your Honours, will obviously place such weight in the context to any other evidence that you hear from the Accused or others as to what was going on at the time.  So there is not -- there shouldn't be a confusion between its being in the indictment; that's not the purpose for its being led.  It's being led, as we advised the Defence 15 months ago, as proof of his intent.  Your Honours -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But is it not a material fact?  
MR. MOSES:
Well, it is relevant, obviously, to the intent we have to prove in the indictment, yes, but in terms of a specific fact of which we are asking for a conviction in relation to an event, no it is not.  It is not material in that manner, it is material in the manner of proof of his intent.  

Your Honours, we disclosed the -- I think my friends are also perhaps being confused as to the Prosecution's obligations of disclosure pursuant to Rule 66, which is prior statements of witnesses.  There is no, in fact, obligation on the Prosecution to disclose exhibits.  We have disclosed, and did disclose, however, the transcript of that video -- of that intercept, on the 6th of December.  It was made clear in the pretrial brief, originally, that there was a witness, BKX, who was going to testify regarding the intercept and on the updated pretrial brief, which was filed, I believe, on the 15th of December last year, we advised that ALG would also be testifying to its being the Accused's voice on that intercept.  So the Defence have never requested to listen to, or asked to hear the original, which, of course, they are entitled to do under the rules.  If they wanted to ask us, they could have done so, and we would have provided it to them.  So there is no issue of late disclosure, Your Honours, because, in fact, under the rules there is no obligation to disclose exhibits in any particular time frame, other than the Defence have the right to ask us to inspect any such exhibits; and they have never asked to inspect the original of that.  

In terms -- I don't really, Your Honours, want to get into an argument over the particular content of what is in the total transcript.  Clearly, it's our position that where the transcript which has been provided says "Karera", it is not right.  That's clearly our position.  And the prime piece of evidence is, in fact, the audio, which, of course, does not say it is Karera; it is simply someone's interpretation.  We are calling a number of people, and as my friend, I think, pointed out, these aren't just anybody, these were people who knew the Accused and his voice intimately; and we will be leading evidence they knew Karera as well.  
So -- but these are issues of weight, Your Honours.  In terms of Rule 89, which is the basis on which we have asked for it to be entered, we say that the evidence is relevant.  It's very relevant.  Your Honour has -- Your Honours, I think, before hearing ALG indicated that you wanted to hear his testimony in relation to it and hear any cross-examination in relation to his testimony regarding the intercept before determining whether or not to admit the evidence.  Now, Your Honour has heard his testimony, Your Honour has heard about his relationship with the Accused and how well he may have known the Accused's voice, and Your Honour has heard the cross-examination in relation to that piece of evidence, which I think consisted of saying -- asking him was he a voice expert, which I think that he replied that he wasn't.  So that's the -- that's the evidence.  We say under Rule 89 it is admissible.  Questions of what weight Your Honours place should be assessed at the end of the trial, and we shouldn't be getting into the argument as to what it really meant until Your Honours have heard all the evidence.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, the Bench is interested to know the source of this CD?  Where did you get it?  Is the person still available?  Can he come to the court or something? 
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, the -- I think the investigator told Your Honours where he had received it from, which was a Rwandan ministry.  We have made some enquiries to try and locate, but to date have not been able to find out for certain the person who originally recorded the document.  We only know where we got it from.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We heard you say, Mr. Moses, that you referred to this already in the June 2005 version of the pretrial brief in connection with demonstrating the Accused's intent in relation to extermination.  But when I read that document, it is indeed intent in relation to genocide; isn't that so?  
MR. MOSES: 
That's correct, yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And then you said that if we look at the summary of the witness statements in the June 2005 version of the pretrial brief, we will find this under Witness BKX, and then it was in December 2006 added in relation to ALG.  These two will-say statements come then, in addition, I understand, namely, Witness UB and Witness AWE.  There is no reference in the summary of these two witnesses either, not even in the December version of the pretrial brief about this telephone tape or whatever.  
MR. MOSES: 
No, it wasn't played to them until last week, Your Honours, which is why, as soon as we did that and received that information, we disclosed it to the Defence in French and English.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So notice was given in relation to one witness in June 2005, in relation to a second witness in December 2006; and then came the two will-say statements in relation to witness 3 and 4, and there notice was given on the 17th of January 2007.  
MR. MOSES: 
In fact, I think in the will-says there were three witnesses, Your Honours.  There was GLJ, UB, and AWE.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are right.  
MR. MOSES: 
One point, Your Honour, the original pretrial brief was filed 31st October 2005, not June.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are quite right.  Thank you.  

Defence counsel, please assist us here.  Is it the position of the Defence that there was never a conversation between your client and this other person, or is it the position that there was at some stage such a conversation, but that the substance of that conversation has been manipulated?  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, as far as Mr. Renzaho is concerned, such a conversation never took place.  He has even drawn your attention to -- a while ago to the issues of problems related to telephone and telephone disconnection.  And I read what his -- his statement, he said there was a disconnection on the 8th of April 1994.  I don't understand exactly what he is saying there, but I believe what he is saying generally is that telephone in Kigali-ville and Kigali-rural at the beginning -- at the outset of the events, suffered several disconnections.  So, he is even doubting the existence of such a communication starting from the 8th of April.  

And let me add to the issue of disclosures done by the Prosecutor.  The new summaries of witness statements were not disclosed to us in French before the first week of the beginning of trial.  There is someone in our team who speaks English, but, once and for all, I want to point it out to my learned friends on the other side that the use of the French language in this Tribunal is not a privilege, it is a right, and I intend to ensure that this is respected.  

I have explained to the Tribunal the conditions under which we worked from the 18th of December.  I was not able to add anything in English.  The -- it is the wish of the Tribunal that we work expeditiously; I agree with that.  And to be able to do so, we need to work in French, which is our language, which is the language of the Accused, and which is the language we chose at the beginning of the trial.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for the submissions by both parties on this issue.  We will consider the matter and come back to you.  What we will do now is to ask you to start the testimony and keep the issue of the tape to the very end of your examination-in-chief.  

Mr. Witness, your headset, please.  We will now start your testimony, Mr. Witness, as we have clarified a few floating issues, and the Prosecution will now ask questions. 
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honours.  Your Honours, for reasons which I think will become clear to you, I am going to need to begin and spend a good deal of time in closed session because of the nature of the evidence that I am going to lead, which I think is likely to identify the Accused -- not the Accused, the witness.  And I apologise for that, but I don't see any way around it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's linked to the function of the person in 1994 and you cannot structure this -- at least not in the beginning, in a way to avoid it?  
MR. MOSES: 
I have looked at the issue quite closely, Your Honour, and I have got a point at which I -- but it's toward the end, where I think we can come into open session, but it's -- I am afraid it's fairly much towards the end of his testimony.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I am afraid we have to say to those in the public gallery that we are now entering into a closed session because of the sensitive matter of the testimony which is about to start.  So we would recommend you to find another trial while we are in closed session.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 13 to 36] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Witness GLJ, we are now in open session and will hear the rest of your examination-in-chief.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	If I can just remind you, Mr. Witness, if you think any answer's going to identify yourself, please tell Their Honours and myself, and we will try and approach it differently.  

You mentioned earlier in your testimony that a man by the name of Jérémie Kaboyi was made conseiller of your secteur.  Do you know what political party that person belonged to?  
A.	He was a member of the MRND. 
Q.	And did you either see, or were you told of, any activities that he did after he was appointed as conseiller of that secteur?  
A.	He was appointed conseiller from the 2nd of May.  He participated in an attack, together with Kigingi and other Interahamwe.  And 16 people died in that attack, close to my residence.  
Q.	How long after he had been appointed as conseiller did that attack near your residence take place?  
A.	He was appointed to that position on the 30th of April, and the attack took place on the 2nd, so that is three days.  
Q.	Do you know who was the conseiller of that secteur at the end of June?  Was it still Mr. Kaboyi, or someone else?  
A.	Kaboyi remained conseiller until the town fell.  
Q.	All right.  Now, Witness, you have told us earlier that, in order to -- to get travel documents, a person had to go to the préfectoral office.  And you also told us that to get a fuel voucher you had to go to the préfectoral office.  And -- is that correct?  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Okay, good.  What I want to ask you is:  For a Tutsi who was living in your secteur in -- well, April 1994, what obstacles, if any, were there for that -- those people to travel or obtain food?  
A.	There were obstacles, because it was difficult to move around, given all the roadblocks, and that would make it difficult for him to go all the way to the office to give all the required documents so as to receive the travel documents.  
Q.	And what about obtaining food?  
A.	There were roadblocks all over the place, and such a person would not be able to go to the market.  And even if he had money, it would have been impossible for him to go and buy food supplies because he will have to go to town every day.  
Q.	Why do you say it would be impossible?  
A.	I say it is impossible because of the roadblocks.  He would not have been able to go through the roadblocks.  
Q.	We may have covered this before, but why is that?  
A.	The reason is that those who attacked the country were Tutsis, and their accomplices were the Tutsis within the country.  And the Tutsis within the country could therefore not move around without being killed, because they were considered as accomplices of the enemy.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, Witness, I'm wondering if you can please be shown a bundle of photographs.  
MR. MOSES: 
These are the ones yet to be formally admitted, Your Honours.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, I'd like you, please, to look at photograph number 5.  There's a number in the bottom right-hand corner.  

Have you got number -- photograph 5 in front of you?  
A.	Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	Now, do you recognise any of the people who are shown in photograph number 5?  
A.	Yes, I recognise one person.  I recognise only one person.  
Q.	And can you please perhaps hold up the photograph and point to the person that you recognise.  
A.	I am able to recognise this person whose wearing a hat -- 
Q.	Is that the hat with -- 
A.	-- with inscriptions. 
Q.	Is that the hat which has RAP -- I think it's RAP on it?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Where had you -- where have you seen that person before?  
A.	He was at the roadblock erected at Gitega, and he was also in the town centre aboard a vehicle that he was using. 
Q.	Do you know the person's name, or not?  
A.	No, I do not know his name -- 
Q.	And was -- 
A.	-- but since I saw him often, I can recognise him.  
Q.	And was he just an ordinary member of the population, was he a soldier, what -- do you know?  
A.	In the course of the month of April, the Interahamwe wore military uniform.  And one could find some of them who were wearing only military beret or military shirts, or military pair of trousers with normal civilian shirts, and they were called Interahamwe.  
Q.	Just to clarify, are you saying that this person was Interahamwe or not?  
A.	Yes, he was an Interahamwe. 
Q.	Now, if I could please ask you to turn to photograph number 8.  Do you have photograph 8? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, do you recognise any of the people who are shown in photograph number 8?  
A.	I recognise one person. 
Q.	All right.  Well, once again, perhaps if you can just hold up the booklet of photographs and point out the person you recognise.  
A.	I am able to recognise this person.  She is a woman wearing clothes made with kitenge and a military uniform. 
MR. MOSES: 
But just for the record, Your Honour, the witness identified the person to the extreme right-hand side of the photograph.  Is that clear enough?  

Is that sufficient, Your Honour, that description?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Oh, yes.  
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This is indeed the person with a wool hat and a grey wind jacket.  Isn't that so, Mr. Witness?  The one on the right-hand side?  
THE WITNESS: 
That is correct, Mr. President.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And do you know the person's name or where they are from?  
A.	I don't know his name, but this woman is from Gitega and I saw her at the roadblock which was erected at Gitega.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. MOSES: 
Now, Your Honour, I believe we've come to the point in the examination-in-chief where I now wish to play the telephone conversation, and I need some direction from Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And that, plus the questions, will take more than five minutes, surely.  

We will adjourn now, resume at 2:40, and we will then be able to provide clarity as to how to proceed.  

The Court is adjourned.  
(Court recessed from 1258H to 1500H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, the Court is now sitting under Rule 15 bis because Judge Egorov was not able to join us this afternoon.  He will be back tomorrow morning, we think.  

The pending issue just before we adjourned for the lunch break related to a tape which has been transcribed and which has been the subject matter of discussion previously in this courtroom.  We are faced with the previous request to tender this document following the testimony of Witness ALG.  The Defence then, this morning, made additional submissions on the subject, followed by submissions by the Prosecution.  

Our view is that we will not accept this tape as an exhibit, based on what we have heard in this trial at this stage.  The Bench is uncertain about its provenance.  We will, however, allow questions relating to this tape and the transcriptions.  That's where we are.  

You have the floor, Prosecution.  
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  

Just to clarify what I now do, am I being permitted to play the tape and ask -- thank you, Your Honours.  

We had some problems last time we tried playing this, you will recall.  Those problems seem to have arisen again, except we are able to play the audio without it coming up on your screen with the transcription.  And I -- what I want to do, Your Honours, is to -- to play that, I can point to Your Honours and to my learned friend where in the transcriptions -- transcripted documents that Your Honours have, where the portion of the tape begins, if that's going to, hopefully, assist matters.  

In the Kinyarwandan transcript, the tape begins on K0167907 at about two-thirds of the way down.  In the French it is -- it commences on the page can the K number K0167847.  And in the English version, it begins at the top of page -- there's actually a page number, page 31.  And that page 31 has the K number K01167775.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, Witness, what I want you to do is to listen to a tape which is going to be played, and I'm then going to ask you some questions in relation to that tape.  So if you'd please just listen as we now play the tape.  
(Audio played) 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Right.  Now, Witness, you've listened to that tape.  Were you able to recognise any voice or voices on that tape?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I was able to recognise the voice of the préfet.  I wasn't able to recognise the other voices. 
Q.	When you say "the préfet", who do you mean?  
A.	I meant Préfet Renzaho, the préfet for Kigali-ville préfecture.  
Q.	Now, do you know a person by the name of François Karera?  
A.	Yes, I know him.  He was the préfet of Kigali-rural préfecture. 
Q.	And do you know what his voice sounds like?  
A.	Yes, because he had been our bourgmestre in Nyarugenge urban commune. 
Q.	And did you hear his voice on the tape?  
A.	No, I did not hear his voice.  
Q.	What makes you say it was the voice of Préfet Renzaho? 
A.	I know Préfet Renzaho's voice well.  He was talking about what had happened in Kigali city and, as far as I know, he was the préfet of Kigali-ville préfecture at the time.  
Q.	Now, when you listened to that tape -- 
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, I don't know if we have the -- a copy of the transcript which can be provided to the witness in court.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Matemanga, do we have a copy of the transcripts available?  They have not yet been tendered, of course, but maybe you have a working copy.  Or the Prosecution may have.  
MR. MOSES: 
They were given to the Witness ALG.  So they weren't ever tendered, as Your Honour quite rightly says, but they were provided to the -- under tab 21, I think, if that assists the registry.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, sir.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, please.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I am going to object because I don't see why that written document will be put to the witness, other than to help him in the answers he will give to the questions which will be put to him.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is the purpose here to single out a couple of words?  
MR. MOSES: 
Exactly, and I don't trust my own pronunciation of the words.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please do that.  
MR. MOSES:
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think you can trust your Kinyarwandan pronunciation. 

MR. MOSES: 
All right.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, when you listened to that tape, did you hear the words "mubakindagure rwoze"? 
A.	Yes, I heard those words. 
Q.	And what do those words mean to you?  
A.	They had just been talking about the accomplices.  That is why he made the suggestion, "exterminate them".  And when he used those words, my understanding was that he was referring to the Tutsi and those who were the opponents of the regime at the time. 
Q.	And whose voice did you hear using those words?  
A.	It was Préfet Renzaho's voice. 
Q.	And then after that, there was -- did you hear the words "urumba" a question, "mubakindagure, mubakinda...gure bose"? 
A.	I heard that, because he said it more than two times. 
Q.	And what does that expression mean to you?  
A.	If I am to refer to what happened in Kigali city, then it was in connection with the killings committed by soldiers, gendarmes, and police officers, killings which targeted Tutsi within Kigali city. 
Q.	And the words that I read out, however, what -- what do you say they mean in Kinyarwandan?  
A.	It's a language which is not very direct, and for those who are not familiar with the context they will not understand because it was a form of coded language.  But it referred to the genocide which was being prepared.  
MR. MOSES: 
All right, Your Honours, I think that's the extent of the examination-in-chief, unless Your Honour has any follow-up questions for the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But let us try to be helpful here.  Now, the first expression you read out was on page K0167908, and that is the expression in two words; isn't that so?  
MR. MOSES: 
That's correct, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the spelling is M-U-B-A-K-I-N-D-A-G-U-R-E. 
MR. MOSES: 
Correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
R-W-O-S-E. 
MR. MOSES: 
That is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And then you read out another portion, which is on page 909?  
MR. MOSES: 
No, Your Honours, that was, in fact, also on 908, about two lines beneath -- in fact, it is two lines beneath the line which Your Honour has just spelt out.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you start with "urumba"?  
MR. MOSES: 
Yes, that's correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  So this time you actually read out something different from last time you read out something from the transcripts; is that so?  Or is it the same portion you read to ALG?  
MR. MOSES: 
I think something was read out.  The first was the same, and then there was a -- I don't know if I was here for that part, perhaps Ms. Melluish -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Be that as it may, the first word being urumba, U-R-U-M-B-A question mark.  And then M-U-B-A-K-I-N-D-A-G-U-R-E comma, M-U-B-A-K-I-N-D-A dot dot dot, G-U-R-E and the last word B-O-S-E. 
 
Have I transcribed it -- or, spelt it correctly now?  
MR. MOSES: 
You have, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  That was the end of the examination-in-chief.  

Cross-examination, please.  Do you want to perform your cross-examination in open or closed session, Defence Counsel?  Can we start in open session?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, my preference is always for an open session.  But, as a matter of fact, I am going to deal with questions, most of which, of course, pertain to the witness's identity.  So there's a risk of their having a negative bearing.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And that risk arises immediately, as I understand you, and that means, unfortunately, that we have to close this hearing and go into closed session.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 45 to 68] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
