P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  The Court is in session.  

We are starting a bit later today because, for a second time, a witness was delayed.  Again, please avoid this.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness and will be referred to as Witness BDC in these proceedings.  You have to tell the truth and the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
(Declaration made by Witness AIA in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have a document with your signature there, haven't you, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This means that the information in this document is correct.  Isn't that so?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, the information is correct.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA:
D. 66.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. 66 admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have a new spelling list which runs from number 1 to number 375.  I trust everyone in the courtroom has this revised spelling list.  Is this so?  That is so.  

Defence, please proceed.
MR. NEKUIE: 
Good morning, Mr. President.

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  Good morning, Counsel.  

Prior to beginning the examination-in-chief, Mr. President, I would like to clarify a point, because it seems that we in the Defence thought the pseudonym is AIE -- AIA.  I don't know if this was a mistake on our part.  Can the Court management tell us whether this is BDC or is or AIA?  I don't know which pseudonym to use for this Witness, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you give us this document?  

Registry, just show this to the Defence, the personal information sheet.  Can you check with them whether that document is correct?  Please give it to them and maybe they can elaborate.

Mr. Moses?  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, I think we have already heard from Witness BDC.  He was one of the first six witnesses who testified.  So I do believe that this should be, as my learned friend indicated, Witness AIA.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So this mistake simply comes from the fact that I was reading from the personal information sheet where the Defence had kept the old pseudonym and not replaced it with AIA.  

Thank you for correcting that, Defence.  And we note for the record that this is, indeed, Witness AIA.  Thank you.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
WITNESS AIA,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, from your personal information sheet, you are a policeman in Kigali city préfecture.  Is this correct?  
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	When were you employed as a policeman in Kigali-ville préfecture, Mr. Witness?  
A.	I was -- I started work in ***********.  
Q.	What were your duties as a police officer, Mr. Witness? 
A.	We were to provide security in Kigali town préfecture in communes -- that is, Nyarugenge, Kacyiru, as well as Kicukiro communes, as well as provide security at marketplaces of the préfecture.  We also accompanied tax collectors to the marketplaces and shops whenever they were doing their job of collecting tax.  In short, that was the mission assigned to the police force of the Kigali city préfecture. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  

Mr. Witness, can you tell the Court what was the hierarchal structure of that police force, that is, if you remember?  
A.	If my memory serves me well, the police force of the Kigali city préfecture was commanded by a gendarme major, whose name was Nyamuhimba, and the police force was placed under the orders of the three communes which I mentioned, namely, Nyarugenge, Kicukiro and Kacyiru.  
Q.	What was the role of the préfet of Kigali city préfecture in the description which you have just provided us?  
A.	The préfet of Kigali city préfecture was the authority responsible for the administration of the préfecture.  But he did not have responsibilities in the mission of the police force.  He was an authority whom I would describe as an office authority who had to work in an office, and therefore I would describe him as a bureaucrat.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you were employed in ********.  Could you please tell the Court what was the situation in Kigali city, security wise, prior to the events of 1994 in Rwanda?  Can you please describe that to the Court, briefly? 
A.	As a matter of fact, the emergence of the multiparty political system in Kigali city brought trouble, acts of violence arising -- or caused by the youth wings of the various political parties.  Towards the end of 1993 there were even killings which targeted officials of political parties.  I would say that, apart from those acts of violence, there were even landmines which were laid, as well as other explosive devices which were laid in certain places, including public transport vehicles.  Some mine -- bombs were even laid at the bus station, the Kigali bus station. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know whether at that time the police force of the Kigali city préfecture took measures in order to bring an end to that situation of insecurity?  
A.	The police force of the Kigali city préfecture did not have the means to put an end to those acts.  But what I can say is that at one point in time this situation was very bad, and Colonel Tharcisse Renzaho had to convene a meeting of the inhabitants of Biryogo and Nyamirambo neighbourhoods, a meeting which was held at the Nyamirambo stadium.  He also convened bus conductors, as well as conductors of minibuses to that meeting.  He invited officers of the gendarmerie, as well as units from the engineering company, which was in charge of determining operations.  All the people invited to the meeting made recommendations to the members of the public, by telling them that they should inform security organs whenever they saw explosive devices.  And, on that occasion, they advised public buses -- operators that they should check the contents of bags of potential passengers.  

People present at the meeting were invited to check -- police were asked to check on people entering marketplaces whenever we had to provide security to marketplaces.  And this applied even to road -- bus stations.  

From 1993 there were joint patrols, including gendarmerie officers and UNAMIR soldiers.  The joint patrols were organised in order to provide security to the city of Kigali.  But that did not change much because insecurity continued to prevail in the city. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Speaking of the resources or means of the police force, do you remember the resources available to the Kigali city police force in order for it to accomplish its mission?  
A.	Compared to the prevailing situation in developed countries, the police force in Kigali city was not well equipped.  Elsewhere, police forces have the necessary equipment to carry out their missions; they have truncheons, they have tear gases; they have even other equipment.  But for the Kigali city préfecture, we only had Kalashnikov sub-machine guns which, even then, were not adequate,  So we were supposed to use those weapons in our mission to maintain order and security.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
When was this meeting which was convened at Nyamirambo stadium, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
To tell you the truth, I don't remember the exact date, but it must have been at the beginning of 1993. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, the patrols carried out by UNAMIR and the gendarmerie, were they carried out in collaboration with the Kigali city police force? 
A.	No, the Kigali city police provided security only at marketplaces, communal offices, secteural offices, head offices of some companies, such as the Utexrwa factory, which had signed a contract with the Kigali city préfecture.  I have to say that the police force of Kigali city provided security to the head office of the Banque Populaire. 
Q.	Apart from the police, which was under the authority of Kigali city préfecture, Mr. Witness, do you know whether the gendarmerie would also work with the authorities of the Kigali city préfecture? 
A.	From what I know, the gendarmerie was under the ministry of defence.  It was not under the ministry of home affairs and communal development.  So those were two different administrative entities. 
Q.	Thank you for that clarification, Mr. Witness.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, Your Honours, I believe that the following part of my examination-in-chief could well reveal the identity of this witness, most probably.  So I respectfully request for a closed session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you refer to a factory which had signed a contract in Kigali, Mr. Witness; yes or no?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you repeat the name of that factory, please, Witness or simply refer to it again as you did in your testimony?  
THE WITNESS:
I spoke about the factory called Utexrwa.  And then there was also the Banque Populaire.  
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Utexrwa is spelt U-T-E-X-R-W-A.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And the spelling comes from the Kinyarwandan cabin -- booth.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  

We will then move into closed session, as requested.  Is that for the remainder of the testimony or just for a portion of it?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
My fear is that it will be for the rest of the examination-in-chief, because he will talk to events which are related directly to his identity, and therefore could reveal his identity.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the duration of the remainder of the testimony is approximately?  I am saying this so that those in the public gallery can know when they might come back. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
At least two hours, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 6 to 61] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
