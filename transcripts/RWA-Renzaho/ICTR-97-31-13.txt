MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, good morning.  The Court is in session.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Your examination-in-chief continues.  

Prosecution.  
WITNESS BUO,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued) 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you said there was a second attack in which you participated at CELA on the 22nd of April.  Now, I'd like you to tell the Court about that, please.  But can you do so slowly?  Can you start by telling us where you were on the morning of the 22nd of April? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you see the problem, Ms. Melluish?  I am giving you the sign.  In that speed you will see two checks.  It is inevitable, so please learn.  Thank you. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you get the question, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS: 
I understood the question.  I was at Angeline Mukandituye's house. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Was there anyone else at Angeline Mukandituye's house? 
A.	Yes, there was.  There were my colleagues, the Interahamwe. 
Q.	And what were you doing? 
A.	In the morning some were cleaning their weapons and others were undergoing training.  
Q.	And you yourself, Mr. Witness?  
A.	*************************************************************************************************************
	***********************************************************************************************.  
Q.	And while you were doing this, did anyone else come to Angeline Mukandituye's house? 
A.	Yes, some people did come.  Odette Nyirabagenzi arrived.  The préfet of Kigali town, Tharcisse Renzaho, also arrived.  They had come to provide us with new instructions and explain to us what we were to do.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, could you tell us, please, who is this Odette Nyirabagenzi?  
A.	Odette Nyirabagenzi was the conseiller for the Rugenge secteur. 
Q.	And had you seen her before at Angeline Mukandituye's house, or was this the first time? 
A.	It was not the first time that I would see her there.  She was a friend of Angeline's, and they would visit one another. 
Q.	Now, you said that the préfet arrived, along with Odette Nyirabagenzi.  Can you tell us how they travelled to Angeline Mukandituye's house?  
A.	They arrived in a car, in a vehicle. 
Q.	And were they the only people in that vehicle, or were there others with them?  
A.	There were also those who were in charge of the security of the préfet, as well as the driver. 
Q.	And when they arrived at the house, what did they do?  
A.	When they got to the house, they entered the house with Angeline, who was waiting for them on the veranda.  They spoke in the house, and a few moments later they came out, and Angeline gave us instructions in the presence of Odette Nyirabagenzi and of Tharcisse Renzaho.  She told us that we were to go to the CELA centre and that we would be told exactly what we were to do when we would be there.  Mr. Renzaho, Tharcisse, was the one who said that. 
Q.	And after you were told to go to CELA, what did these three people do?  
A.	The Interahamwe, the president, Claude, and his people went on board a vehicle.  
Q.	What about Tharcisse Renzaho, Odette Nyirabagenzi and Angeline Mukandituye?  What did they do after you were given the instructions?  
A.	They left at the same time as the Interahamwe and Claude, since the instructions had just been given.  The instructions were to be complied with, because we had respect for our leaders. 
Q.	And what about you?  What did you do after you heard those instructions?  
A.	I distributed the weapons very rapidly, and then I counted how many people were left at the location to ensure the security of our headquarters.  Then I used the back door and I joined the others at the CELA centre.  
Q.	Can you recall what weapons you distributed? 
A.	Since some people had received their weapons the previous day, I only distributed 12 firearms:  One G3 I gave to Gasigwa, eight Kalashnikov rifles, and three R4s.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This preparatory meeting, Mr. Witness, lasted from when to when?  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  The meeting did not last long.  Renzaho arrived, he went into the house, and approximately 15 minutes later they came out of the house to give us the instructions.  I believe this was planned beforehand.  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
When did people leave for CELA?  
THE WITNESS: 
Between 8 and 9, but I must say I did not pay much attention to the time.  I was, rather, paying attention to the instructions that were being given to us.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Now, when you got to CELA, what did you find there?  
A.	When I arrived, the officials were in the courtyard of the CELA centre.  They had come out of the building.  I met Tutsi refugees who had sought refuge there and who were being taken out of the buildings.  And we started setting aside the young men, women, and children.  When I arrived there, I was not inactive.  I helped the others sort out the refugees.  So there were from 60 to 70 people.  We beat them up, and Angeline forced us to make them board vehicles to go and kill them.  So we beat them up and forced them into three vehicles in which they were packed, and we took them.  I stayed on the site and I was in fact *************************************.  
Q.	Now, you say that you helped the others to sort out the refugees.  Why did you do that?  Did somebody instruct you to do it?  
A.	When I got there, I noted that that was what was being done, so I didn't want to remain inactive, whereas it was the instruction that had been given by the authorities.  Claude, who was my leader, was there, and he was sorting people.  And I was not to let him do that alone.  I was to provide him with assistance.  
Q.	And on what basis were you and the others sorting the people?  
A.	The criterion was as follows:  Odette Nyirabagenzi knew there were people from her secteur.  Angeline was a school inspector, and she also knew the inhabitants.  The préfet himself knew the Rugenge secteur because he was there often.  So they were the people who knew the people who were to be sorted.  When the refugees were taken out, we were told to take X, Y, or Z, and we also chose the people who looked like Tutsi.  There were no other sorting criteria.  Those were the criteria we would use. 
Q.	And who was it who was telling you to take X, Y, or Z?  
A.	There were two people in particular who were very active.  There was Odette and there was Angeline.  They would tell us, in such-and-such's family, you should take X and Y.  They were our neighbours, we knew them.  When we would be told to take people from family X, Y, or Z, it was not difficult for us because we knew these people well before the events. 
Q.	And while this was happening, where was Renzaho?  
A.	Renzaho was in the courtyard of CELA with the others.  He did not remain in his vehicle at that time.  And he left when we had already sorted the refugees and we had put a group of them in a vehicle.  That was when he left.  
Q.	Now, do you recall how -- how long this whole process took, between your arriving at CELA and putting those first people into a vehicle?  
A.	Not much time elapsed.  It took us from 40 to 50 minutes.  Because once the -- the two people left, the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge, Jean Bizimana, arrived, and somebody told him something. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, you must help me to understand what you have just said about the sorting-out process.  Did you first tell us that there were 60 to 70 Tutsi refugees there?  Was that your evidence?  
THE WITNESS: 
There were more than 100 refugees, but we took a group of 60 to 70 people who were those who were to be killed.  Otherwise there were more than 100 refugees, because after the abduction of the 60 or 70 people, there was another group that remained on the site.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So you sorted out 60 to 70 persons, selecting them from the more than 100.  That's what we have now heard.  Is that true?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, these more than 100, were they all Tutsi, or were they not?  
THE WITNESS: 
In general, those who would go and seek refuge had a good reason to do so.  Most of them were Tutsis who had left their places of residence, and they were our neighbours.  We knew them.  Why would have a Hutu gone and sought refuge there when nobody was hunting him down, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Exactly.  And that's why we need to understand the criteria for the selection.  Because here you have more than 100 that, in principle, should seem to fall within the group to be killed, and still only 60 to 70 were sorted out.  Why this 60 to 70?  
THE WITNESS: 
Odette and Mukandituye were the ones who decided that we should act in that manner.  There were some people who were more wanted than others, and there were people who we did not find at the CELA centre who were at the Saint Paul centre.  I believe I will have ample time to talk about this, because it's going to be a very long story.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So you simply followed instructions as to whom to pick?  
THE WITNESS: 
That is correct.  We were to comply with the instructions that were given to us, and that is what we did.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Of those 60 to 70, can you recall roughly how many were men, women, old, young, children; what sort of make-up did these people have?  
A.	Following the instructions given, we did not pay much attention to women and children.  We were more interested in men and young men, because they were for -- according to us, the Inyenzi-Inkotanyi who had attacked the country.  Most of those we took were men and young boys.  
Q.	Now, you said that these were 60 to 70 people that were selected to be killed.  At what stage did you realise that that was going to be their fate?  
A.	It was decided on the spot that the people were to be selected and driven somewhere and killed.  We were told that we were to take them to the place called CND, and we knew what such letters meant, CND.  And it was done; there is evidence to that effect.  
Q.	And who was it who told you to take them to CND? 
A.	It was Angeline Mukandituye who told us to do that.  This place called CND exists.  It is well known.  And the people who were killed and buried at that location were -- were later on exhumed and buried in dignity in Gisozi. 
Q.	Can you recall where Renzaho was when you were given the instructions to take these people to CND? 
A.	When we were instructed to take these people to CND, Angeline Mukandituye was with Renzaho, Tharcisse, when the order was given.  So Renzaho was present.  Renzaho left after the instructions were given.  It was something that had been planned -- rather, that had been discussed beforehand.  
Q.	And when that instruction was given by Angeline, where were you?  
A.	I was there.  She called Claude.  I also came near, and she gave the instruction to myself as well as to Claude, and we went to inform other Interahamwes, such as Castar, Mishimana (phonetic), Michel, and other Interahamwe.  If you wish to have the names of all the Interahamwe, I can give them to you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Let's recapitulate the entire name of Michel.  Shall we do that?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
I believe the name was Mishimana, or that's what I heard.  But I thought we heard Castar, which is on the list, and then the name "Mishimana".  Perhaps the witness can confirm the names that he gave.  
THE WITNESS: 
Let me repeat the names.  There are many names I mentioned, but let me give you those of the ones that were considered as being the most important:  Gasigwa; Fidèle Habimana, also known as Castar. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, all we want you to do now is to repeat the names you gave in your previous answer.  We just need the spelling of those names, or at least clarity.  Can you repeat them again, please?  
THE WITNESS: 
There is Michel Nkeshimana, Gasigwa, and Habimana, Castar. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honour was correct.  It was Michel. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Mr. Witness, how many vehicles did it take for these 60 or 70 people to be taken away from the CELA site?  
A.	Well, it was not difficult to take them.  We only used three vehicles. 
Q.	What kind of vehicles were they, if you can remember?  
A.	There was one minibus, Hiace, red in colour, and I even remember who was driving the vehicle.  His name was Lambert, son of Mucakari. 
Q.	Can you give us that last name again, please?  
A.	Lambert, son of Léon Mucakari. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay, Lambert is probably L-A-M-B-E-R-T.  

Are you good at spelling, Mr. Witness, or shall we ask the Kinyarwandan booth to help us with these names?  What's your preference?  
THE WITNESS: 
Have no fear, I believe I can spell out the name "Mucakari". 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  So let's now hear the second name that was Léon M-U-S-H-A-K-A-L-I; is that true?  
THE WITNESS: 
No, that is not it.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So what is the right version, then, please?  
THE WITNESS: 
M-U-C-A-K-A-R-I.  Mucakari.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And then we need help with Gasigwa.  He's not on our spelling list and he was not spelt yesterday.  Can you help us with him?  
THE WITNESS: 
Gasigwa is spelt G-A-S-I-G-W-A.  Gasigwa. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you so much.  And could you kindly now, whenever you introduce a new name which has not been mentioned in the courtroom before, help us with the spelling.  And then we will make headway.  Here comes the next question.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Besides the minibus, what other vehicles were there?  
A.	There was a double-cabin Toyota driven by one Rurangwa who hails from Rutongo, and he was our driver.  Let me spell out the name Rurangwa.  R-U-R-A-N-G-W-A.  
Q.	Thank you, that's very helpful, Mr. Witness, if you do that.  

Now, are you aware whether the people who were loaded on to these vehicles knew, at that time, what was going to happen to them?  
A.	Some of them got to know what would happen.  If someone starts beating you up and that person has a weapon, and if you know the reason why you went to seek refuge at that location, you can understand.  They knew that their Tutsi compatriots had been killed, and I can give you examples.  And if the Accused in this trial disagrees with me, I can give a number of examples, all those who say that they knew what would be their fate.  
Q.	When the vehicles left CELA, did you go with them or did you remain at CELA yourself, or go elsewhere? 
A.	No, Claude was the one who left with the vehicles.  I was supposed to stay on the site to make sure that we had carried out the task that had been entrusted to us.  So I stayed at CELA and I left CELA on foot.  And I can tell you what occurred there after the vehicles departed.  
Q.	Please do tell us what occurred there after the vehicles departed.  
A.	Once the vehicles left and the officials also, such as Renzaho, left, the former bourgmestre of the Nyarugenge commune, Jean Bizimana, arrived.  He had come to see whether what was to be done at that location had been done.  He was well aware of what was to be done.  The wife of one Charles Rwanga, who had been abducted and whose name is Rose Murorunkwere, put a question to Bizimana:  "Where did you take our husbands?"  Bizimana did not answer, remained mum, and a few moments later he went -- he left.  Rose is still alive, and if you call her to testify, as you did for me, she can vouch for this story.  
Q.	Thank you.  Those names are on the list, numbers 242 and 167.  

Did anything else happen at CELA before you left?  
A.	No, nothing in particular.  I simply tried to check whether the instruction had been complied with.  I went to CND on foot, and if you want to know what I saw on my way to CND, I can tell you what I saw.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Why did you say the "former bourgmestre, Jean Bizimana"?  Do we agree that he was bourgmestre in April '94?  
THE WITNESS:
The one who was bourgmestre from April until the time when we fled the country, that was him.  I said the "former bourgmestre of Nyarugenge commune" because he no longer is today.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's what you meant by "former".  Thank you.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Firstly, Mr. Witness, can you tell us how long it took for you to travel from CELA to the place called CND? 
A.	Since some people were killed on the way, around 15 people, it took me 15 minutes to cover the distance between CELA and CND.  The CELA centre is next to the JOC.  If some of you are not familiar with the -- with the location, I can give you some explanations so that you will be able to place the different locations on a map.  The CND is not far from the Nyarugenge (sic) secteur office -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Rugenge secteur office, correction. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Why did it take you longer to get to CND because some people were killed?  Can you explain what you mean by that?  
A.	It took me a while because some people were taken out of the vehicles and shot down.  I knew some of them.  I can give you their names and those of their families.  Since I was walking, I had weapons.  So I was not worried, and that is the reason for which it took me so long to reach the CND.  
Q.	Did you yourself see these people being killed?  
A.	No, I did not see them die with my own eyes, but I saw the dead bodies of some of them and I knew that they had been put on board the vehicles.  
Q.	And you mentioned that you knew some of these people, or you recognised them.  Can you tell us who you recognised?  
A.	Let me give you their names.  There was Charles Rwanga.  There was Déglote Rwanga, son of Rwanga.  There was Albert, who was a driver at ORINFOR and who was a karate instructor at the JOC.  He even trained me.  There were two of Mr. Pierre Sebushishi's children, who was conseiller of the Rugenge secteur, and who was replaced by Odette Nyirabagenzi.  As for the others, I did not know them.  But since the people I just listed were neighbours of mine, I was able to recognise the bodies. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Numbers 242 and 243 and 256.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Do you know why a gentleman called Charles Rwanga was targeted?  
A.	Yes.  Charles Rwanga was a member of the RPF in Rugenge.  That was well known.  He was killed by Nkeshimana, because the son of Charles Rwanga, called Yacinthe, was also killed in a specific place.  This son of Rwanga had problems with Nkeshimana. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Nkeshimana is 183, and the other name mentioned is Yacinthe at 246.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Mr. Witness, what about Albert, the driver for ORINFOR?  Do you know why he was a target?  
A.	Albert was being sought, first of all, because he's a Tutsi.  Another reason is that he refused to teach some of my Interahamwe colleagues, and that is why he was killed.  
Q.	And the children of Pierre Sebushishi, do you know why they -- or, that family would have been a target?  
A.	Very easy.  Sebushishi was well known and he was very sought after.  At one point in time, they threw a grenade into his house, and the wife lost one leg.  At one point in time, Renzaho dismiss (sic) him from his position.  So it is not surprising that his children were killed.  Even the wife was killed later on.  The wife is called Marianne and was killed by one Fidèle.  
Q.	But was there anything particular about him that meant either that he'd been dismissed or that he was sought after?  
A.	Sebushishi could not bear injustice.  Secondly, he was opposed to members of the MRND, and the préfet could not support him because Odette Nyirabagenzi was a member of the MRND.  I know everything that happened because I am also from the Rugenge secteur.  
Q.	Can you tell the Court, please, how these people had been killed?  
A.	It is sad, but I will tell you all the same, because what we are interested in is the truth.  All those people were killed by bullets.  None of them was killed with a machete or a knife.  But there are other people who threw themselves into the pit before they were killed, because they did not want to be killed by bullet.  And after all of them were put in the pit, they threw a grenade into it because -- so as to ensure that even those alive can be killed.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Was Marianne killed by Fidèle Habimana or some other Fidèle?  
THE WITNESS: 
It is Fidèle Habimana, alias Castar.  Castar is a nickname he gave himself, but his real name is Fidèle Habimana.  And he is the one who shot Marianne, the wife of Sebushishi.  He kill her in her house.  
MS. MELLUISH: 
I wonder if the witness can be given Exhibit P. 6 -- actually, perhaps, the third book of P. 6, if that could be extracted.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Do you have that book now, Mr. Witness?  Could you please turn to the photo numbered 08.  The photographs are numbered underneath them.  
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	Could you just hold that picture up so we can see whether we're all looking at the same photograph, please.  Thank you, yes.  

Mr. Witness, do you recognise what is shown in this photograph at all?  
A.	Yes, I do recognise what can be seen on this photograph.  This is Straton Iyaremye's house.  That was the place that was known as CND, and it is next to the Rugenge secteur office.  I can show you the place, because I know it quite well.  
MS. MELLUISH: 
That name, Iyaremye, Straton, is at number 85 on the list. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the first name was S-T-R-A-T-O-N.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Looking at this photograph, has this building changed since April 1994?  
A.	I see that there are doors and windows that were added, but otherwise I do recognise the house.  I know it well.  But I note that doors and windows were added, and I see children who seem to be schoolchildren, but it is indeed the same house.  
Q.	Do you know why there were no doors and windows in April 1994?  
A.	It was a house that was being built.  It was not inhabited. 
Q.	And you said that this was the place where people were killed.  Where were the bodies put?  
A.	The bodies were put in a pit which was inside the house, and the others were put in two other pits which were outside.  One of the pits was close to the place where you could see the children.  But inside the house, there was a bigger pit, and it was into that pit that they put many of the bodies.  
Q.	Do you know why the house of a gentleman called Straton Iyaremye was used as a place to put bodies?  
A.	Straton Iyaremye was not on good terms with Nyirabagenzi and Angeline -- Mukandituye, Angeline.  But subsequently, Straton Iyaremye was also killed.  His wife was called Régine Kandege, and I know that family very well.  
Q.	Can you spell that last name for us, Witness?  
A.	I think it was, rather, Régine Kandege.  Kandege is K-A-N-D-E-G-E.  Let me repeat.  It's K-A-N-D-E-G-E.  Kandege, Régine.  I believe you can spell Régine, the first name.  
Q.	Witness, you said that you left CELA sometime after the refugees who were taken in the vehicles.  When you arrived at CND, what did you find there, if anything?  
A.	When I got to the CND, I saw that some people were being shot and their bodies were being put in the pit.  There were some people who were jumping into the pit by themselves so as to avoid being shot.  After that, a grenade was thrown into the pit to ensure that everybody was killed.  I saw that with my own eyes.  I got there at the time they were shooting the last victim.  This operation was concluded in the afternoon.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Were all 60-70 killed?  
THE WITNESS: 
They were all killed.  The pit was fairly large; nobody was able to escape.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	You said that some people were shot and then their bodies were thrown into the pit.  Where were they being shot, do you know?  
A.	It was close to that pit at the CND, at Straton's place.  And when I got there, they were shooting the last person.  And I was able to see that two persons jumped into the pit themselves before they were able to shoot them.  I was standing at that place when the attackers were shooting the people.  
Q.	Which pit was it that the people were thrown into, or jumped into?  
A.	This is in the pit which was within the house.  I was able to see that there was a portion of about ten metres which was not occupied by bodies.  It was a fairly large pit.  Very large pit.  
Q.	Can you describe the pit in a little more detail?  How big was the opening at the top of the pit, roughly?  
A.	I have just explained to you that from where -- from where the bodies, the pile of bodies stopped, there was ten metres on -- above it.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The question is different, Mr. Witness.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Witness, I'm simply asking that, at the top of the pit, how big was the hole?  How -- how wide was it, for example?  
A.	I'm sorry, I thought you were referring to the depth of the pit.  I would say that the -- the pit was quite large.  It was not narrow.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You want precision here?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
No, Your Honour.  I don't think -- I'm not sure that we'll get it easily.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	You said that -- I believe you said that this process of killing people and putting their bodies into a pit took until about 3 p.m.; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, the attackers took all the time they required, and all that was concluded around 1500 hours, which you referred to.  I even have some other evidence which I have not given here.  If there are people who are challenging what I am saying, I am ready to give other evidence.  
Q.	Can you explain why this process took such a long time?  Because you went to CELA in the morning, you said, around about 9 o'clock.  
A.	First of all, we sorted out these people.  We picked them up and put them on the vehicle.  And then finally we killed them.  So you'll understand that it took a lot -- a lot of time.  
Q.	And when you had finished, how did you and your fellow Interahamwe feel that your work had been done?  
A.	We realised that we had accomplished our task because we had killed those people.  And then we went to Angeline and Kandege, where our headquarters was located, to tell them that we had accomplished the task that was entrusted to us.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, let us backtrack a little bit.  I do not know whether this really has any legal significance, but coming back to the pit, the width of the pit.  Would you say that it was wider than the distance between you and me?  
THE WITNESS: 
No, the dimension is less than the distance between the President and myself.  The width would be about the same distance as -- that same distance as the distance between me and these people who are directly in front of me.  But this pit is still there, and if you are interested it can be shown to you at the site.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
According to the courtroom measurements, the distance between the witness to be registry table in front of the witness is 2 metres and 30 centimetres.  

Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know a place called Saint Paul centre?  
A.	I know all those places, and I know what happened there.  I participated in the things that happened in those places.  
Q.	Were you involved in attacks at Saint Paul centre?  
A.	Yes, several attacks were launched against the Saint Paul centre, and I believe in my statement I specifically referred to two attacks -- which Tharcisse Renzaho participated in.  If -- well, I referred to the two most important attacks, but if you are interested I can talk to you about the other attacks which are less important.  
Q.	For the time being, Mr. Witness, can we focus on the first of those two most important attacks.  Can you tell us, if you know, when it took place?  
A.	The first attack was carried out in May, and the last one was carried out when the Inkotanyi came to rescue the Tutsi who were at the Sainte Famille parish and the Saint Paul centre.  I think it is easy to determine the date of this last attack because this is something that -- an event that is well known.  The first attack was carried out using the excuse of communal work.  
Q.	And could you tell us, please, what happened?  
A.	There were some Tutsis that we could not find in the houses, and we learnt that they were at the Saint Paul centre.  Others were at the CELA centre, and some at the Sainte Famille parish.  We therefore launched this attack using the pretext that they were Inkotanyi who were shooting us -- the Inyenzi who were shooting us at night.  We just wanted to get the Tutsi who had escaped from us.  We went there with some inhabitants.  It is well known, and you can -- it is well known in the Nyarugenge secteur.  You can investigate on it.  People will tell you what happened.  

So we got to the Saint Paul centre and we asked the refugees to get out of the buildings.  Some of the persons who were at the Saint Paul centre are still alive.  I can give you their names, and I'm sure they will tell you what happened.  We got these people out and killed some of them.  The others remained there.  There were a lot of refugees at that place.  Some were natives of Rugenge, and others came from other localities.  We therefore selected those who were on our list, those that we wanted to kill.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you said that Tharcisse Renzaho was involved in this attack.  How was that?  
A.	Angeline and Odette were not in agreement on the number of people to be killed.  And because they were not in agreement, Renzaho intervened.  He came to the place and Angeline and Odette asked -- went to him and asked him what was to be done.  Renzaho had a sheet of paper in his hands which was similar to the one Mukandituye was holding.  So they came back and said that only those persons whose names were on the list were to be arrested.  So these were Emmanuel Rukundo, Aristarque, and one Mazimpaka.  I have just recalled one more person that I did not talk about.  His -- that person was called Zorro.  Zorro was the brother of Régine.  I have just remembered this fourth person.  I did not mention him in my statement.  
MS. MELLUISH:
The name "Emmanuel Rukundo" is at 229 on the list, and Mazimpaka at 134.  Zorro is not on the list.  
THE WITNESS: 
I know his name does not appear on the list, because it is only now that I remembered that he, too, was abducted during the first attack.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So maybe you could spell that name, or nickname?  Is it Zorro like the person in the books, Z-O-R-R-O?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I believe that is the correct spelling.  That is how we knew him.  He had a sister called Régine who lived close to the small market in the Rugenge secteur.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But then you also mentioned a third name, and phonetically it sounded like "Istark".  Can you help us?  
THE WITNESS: 
Aristarque, I believe you should know how to spell that.  I also referred to a young man called Mazimpaka. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mazimpaka was easy, Mr. Witness, because we have that on our list.  But can you help us with the name I asked you to spell?  
THE WITNESS: 
I believe you can look for the spelling yourself, and I should think that his name should be on the list.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Aristarque is spelt A-R-I-S-T-A-R-Q-U-E.  That's from the Kinyarwanda booth.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much to the booth.

1000H
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I would like you again to tell this story a little more slowly, please.  Tell us, if you can, what time of day it was when you first were aware that an attack was going to take place at Saint Paul's centre? 
A.	I got to know in the morning, but I cannot recall the date nor the exact time.  That morning, Angeline told us that those people have escaped from us, and we know that they're at the Saint Paul centre.  And the only thing to do was to claim that there are people who fire at us at the roadblock in the night.  And then we'll say that there are some Inyenzis wielding weapons and hiding at the Saint Paul centre.  That is what we told the people who were there to allow us to go and fetch those people.  But we knew what we were doing.  We had agreed with Angeline in the morning during our meeting.  

We, therefore, had to call on some inhabitants and told them that there were some bush close to the Saint Paul centre and the CELA centre, and that all the bush had to be cut down and to be wielded off so that the Inyenzi would not hide in there.  So that is all we told them -- we told them, but we knew that we were going to fetch these people and kill them.  So the communal work took place.  

I have one piece of evidence that I do know to give to you today.  I can give you the names of the other authorities who can confirm to you that this communal work did take place.  
Q.	Thank you, I'm not sure that we need that, Mr. Witness.  Could you tell us, if you can remember, what time you yourself went to Saint Paul centre that day? 
A.	It was in the morning, Fidèle went to fetch some members of the population from their residence.  Let me give you one piece of evidence.  I will keep the rest for other occasions.  He is the one who went for the leader called Narcisse Nzamwita.  He's in prison in Kigali and he pleaded guilty.  I testified against him and he asked to be pardoned.  I would not give all the evidence I have, so that the accused cannot make use of them.  But I came here to tell the truth and the whole truth.  
Q.	I'm afraid you're going to have to help us by spelling the name that you gave please, Mr. Witness? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Only the last name, please. 
THE WITNESS:
Yego, N-Z-A-M-W-I-T-A, Nzamwita. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	So in the morning, Fidèle went to get some members of the population.  What did you do? 
A.	After having given instructions, we let the others look for members of the population.  (By order of the Court, the following portion of the transcript was extracted and filed under separate cover) we had approximately 110 Interahamwe.  I was to go to Saint Paul to see whether the Interahamwe would arrive in time for us to be able to do our work.  We had enough weapons.  We had a vehicle and it was not difficult.  So it was Fidèle Ngamije who went to get the members of the population to assist us in this operation.  
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, I wonder if the sentence beginning (By order of the Court, the following portion of the transcript was extracted and filed under separate cover) could be extracted from the record? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we'll do that.  The words from "when" until "we" will be placed under separate cover.  Video booth, please do not transmit that. 
MS. MELLUISH:
Thank you. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Having collected together members of the population can you estimate how many people -- Interahamwe and those members of the population went to Saint Paul that morning? 
A.	There were many people.  I would be hard pressed to tell you how many exactly.  Some of the acts that were committed at that location -- I can tell you about those who survived the attack and those who were killed.  I promised I would provide evidence on what was done.  If the Accused accepts what was done -- very well, but if he does not agree, then I'm ready to provide evidence to show that he is not telling the truth.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have lack of clarity in connection with Fidèle.  Did you refer to one or two persons in connection with Fidèle leaving to get members of the population to assist you? 
THE WITNESS:
I talked about Fidèle and of Ngamije.  I also mentioned the name of Narcisse Nzamwita because he was in charge of the Bwahirimba cellule.  It was Fidèle who went to fetch Nzamwita. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And, you see, we have identified some Fidèles here, and we know Castar, but now the last name of the Fidèle you just referred to, can you spell that, please? 
THE WITNESS:
I talked about Ngamije.  So there was Fidèle and there was Ngamige.  Those are the two different individuals.  Ngamige was an Interahamwe and Fidèle Habimana also known as Castar was also an Interahamwe.  It was Fidèle who went to get Nzamwita to take him to the Saint Paul centre.  I believe that is clear.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but you know we receive your testimony through two languages, Mr. Witness, and we have to make sure that there is consistency in the courtroom.  So if you would now, and I'm asking you for the third time, kindly spell that name?  

THE WITNESS:
Yes, N-D-A-M-I-J-E, Ndamije.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Now, when you arrived at Saint Paul's, what did you find there? 
A.	When we arrived at Saint Paul, we had to take the people who were in the Saint Paul building out.  I shall give you the name of the person who sorted them, and who plead guilty to such charges and begged for forgiveness.  I mentioned him amongst the Interahamwe **************************************, his name was Charles Ntaganda.  He is detained at the Kigali central prison and he pled guilty to such charges.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, Charles is easy and now the last name, the spelling, please? 
THE WITNESS:
N-T-A-G-A-N-D-A, Ntaganda. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, you have kindly agreed to assist us with the spelling and we have developed a good routine for that.  Now I'm asking you to do something else:  Please do not come up with all these names until the Prosecution asks you to do so, we may not need them.  

Next question, please.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Why did you have to take people out of the Saint Paul building? 
A.	I gave you the reason for which we were to take them out of the building.  It was because there were people we were looking for in order to go and kill them -- and, indeed, we arrested them.  
Q.	Whose idea was it to take them out?  Was this an instruction you were given or did it just come instinctively to you? 
A.	It was Odette Nyirabagenzi and Angeline Mukandutiye who had decided that this should be done while we were at Angeline's place.  And the idea had come up because there were people who had escaped us and we were wondering how we could locate them. 
Q.	How did you sort the people out? 
A.	Their houses were well known.  Most of them were our neighbours.  There was no secret in the Rugenge secteur.  Besides, we knew where the Tutsis lived, so it was not difficult -- and to confirm what I'm stating, there was one Tutsi who survived this attack.  I put him on the side -- he is still alive, and if you wish to hear him, I am sure that he will be able to answer your question just as I did.  
Q.	Can you confirm how many people you were specifically sent to look for at Saint Paul? 
A.	When we went to Saint Paul, there were 50 of us.  The others had remained to man the roadblocks to make sure that the Inyenzis would not infiltrate our secteur. 
Q.	Sorry, you may not have understood my question.  I was trying to ask you how many people -- how many of the refugees at Saint Paul you were sent to find? 
A.	There were Tutsis who had escaped us, but we were looking more specifically for Emmanuel Rukundo and Aristarque and that because Emmanuel Rukundo had very bad relations with Odette Nyirabagenzi because they belonged to different political parties.  Rukundo, Emmanuel was from PSD; Mukandutiye and Nyirabagenzi were members of the MRND.  And slightly before the genocide, their relations between these two women and Emmanuel Rukundo were quite tense.  And Rukundo, Emmanuel had very good relations with Sebushishi; that was the reason why we were asked to spare no effort to find Emmanuel Rukundo for him to be killed. 
Q.	Now you mentioned earlier that these two ladies had lists with them, is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And did you yourself see those lists? 
A.	I saw one list that Mukandutiye was holding in her hand and I gave you the names of those I was able to recognise on the list. 
Q.	Can you remember in total how many names there were on the list? 
A.	I looked at that list, but I did not really pay attention to the number of people who were on the list.  When we carried out that operation, the leaders were there and they told us, "Now we can leave". 
Q.	And at that time, when they told you you can leave -- or they can leave, had Renzaho appeared or not yet? 
A.	When we were asked to stop and to leave, Renzaho had already settled the conflict between the two women and he had already left.  
Q.	So at what point did you first see Renzaho? 
A.	Renzaho arrived around 11; that was when he arrived there. 
Q.	And how did he arrive at Saint Paul?  How did he travel to Saint Paul, if you know? 
A.	When he arrived at Saint Paul, he had parked his car a bit higher up the road and he came on foot.  He came and he discussed with the -- these two persons and then he left.  
Q.	And for approximately how long was he present at Saint Paul that day? 
A.	He did not remain there long, around ten minutes and then he left.  What was important is that he had just made a decision as to what was to be done, and that there was an understanding. 
Q.	Well, we'll come on to the conflict that you talked about and you said that he resolved in a moment.  But first, can you tell us where you were in relation to Renzaho when he arrived? 
A.	Since it was Mukandutiye, who was a very important person, I was next to her.  Odette and Renzaho were standing together and I was next to Angeline, ***********************************************************.  
Q.	And can you recall any conversation between these people? 
A.	The two ladies went next to Renzaho and I stayed with my group.  After Renzaho told them what they were to do, they came back towards me and -- towards us and gave us instructions which we were to comply with.  
Q.	How do you know that there was any conflict between Odette Nyirabagenzi and Angeline Mukandutiye? 
A.	I got to know that there was such a conflict because Odette Nyirabagenzi wanted everyone to be -- all of those who were at Saint Paul to be killed and she was angry.  Whereas Mukandutiye was saying, "Well, we agreed on what was to be done from the outset."  And since there was that conflict, the préfet came and made the two women agree.  
Q.	And what were the instructions that you were then given? 
A.	Angeline told us that we were to implement the instructions given to us and that we were to look out -- to look for those who were on the list she had given to us.  
Q.	So is it correct that the conflict was resolved in the favour of Angeline? 
A.	That was the case.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
May I ask, Mr. Witness, do you know how Mr. Renzaho got to know that there was a conflict between those ladies?  
THE WITNESS:
Renzaho worked with the -- these women, and on specific occasions, Mukandutiye would call Renzaho on the telephone and would converse with him.  And sometimes she would tell us, "Renzaho asked me to tell you to do this or that", and we would not hesitate to implement or comply with whatever was requested from us.  So I can tell you without any hesitation that Renzaho was aware of what the two ladies wished to do.  

Your Honours, I shall give you sufficient evidence and I hope you will be satisfied.  I shall refer to the relations between all these people, and I will explain to you why we did what we did.  And before I leave this courtroom, I am convinced that you will be satisfied. 
JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you very much.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Mr. Witness, if Odette Nyirabagenzi and Angeline Mukandutiye had a conflict at the Saint Paul centre, how can you explain, if at all, how did Renzaho get to know about that so as to be able to come to Saint Paul and sort it out? 
A.	We were asked to go to Saint Paul.  At Angeline's place, there was a telephone.  If when we left, Angeline called Renzaho -- well, that's a possibility.  But I'm not aware of that, I was -- I'm not supposed to know what she was doing.  She was our superior and she had different ways of contacting the main person in charge -- and that was Renzaho.  
Q.	Thank you.  After the dispute between the ladies had been resolved, did Renzaho leave immediately or did he stay for any length of time? 
A.	Renzaho left immediately thereafter.  He stayed for a long time during the second attack.  But on that occasion of the first attack, he left immediately because he had just resolved the conflict. 
Q.	And after he left, what did you do? 
A.	After he left, we implemented a plan that was well known and we all knew what we had to do.  All I did was to comply with the instructions that were given to me.  I could not not implement such instructions that were given to us.  
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Witness, it may seem very obvious to you what you then did, but could you please tell the Court? 
A.	I told you that some Tutsis were arrested -- among which Emmanuel Rukundo, who was put on board the vehicle of Faustin, who was the owner of the bar called Las Vegas.  Some people were killed on the way and the dead bodies were seen by everyone.  And the bodies were loaded in a truck belonging to a gentleman who worked at MINITRAP.  And there's a piece of evidence that I shall keep for other opportunities regarding the name of that driver.  
Q.	In total, how many of the Tutsis were arrested as you've described it? 
A.	Since there were many people, I must say that I did not count the people who were there.  There were many people.  And the person we were the most interested in was Emmanuel Rukundo.  As for the others, it was of no importance since the objective was to arrest Emmanuel Rukundo. 
Q.	How did you take this group of people away from Saint Paul? 
A.	I am getting tired.  We had firearms, we had vehicles.  Renzaho had given us vehicles; we were not to go on foot.  We had enough vehicles -- those that had been made available to us by Renzaho, as well as those we had looted.  We no longer needed the assistance of anybody because there were many of us and we had equipment.  
Q.	Where did you take the people to? 
A.	We killed them on the way from Saint Paul all the way to the toll gate, the small markets, to Las Vegas.  There were bodies everywhere.  And if you were to interview the survivors or even other people who were not being sought, they will tell you that bodies were all over the place, like sorghum -- like sorghum plants.  
Q.	Did you kill them on the way to a specific destination? 
A.	I told you that the person we were looking for, we put him on board the vehicle which was driven by Jean-Baptiste Kalimuda.  And we went round the Rugenge secteur announcing to everybody that we'd found Emmanuel Rukundo, and we took him to his house.  And that is where we killed him, together with Aristarque, and we buried the two bodies at that place.  Subsequently, those two bodies were exhumed, but at the time, that is where we buried them.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't have the last name of Jean-Baptiste in both languages. 
THE WITNESS:
You can spell Jean-Baptiste, so I'll give you Kalimuda.  K-A-L-I-M-U-D-A.  Kalimuda.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Where was Angeline at this time when you were killing the people removed from Saint Paul, do you know? 
A.	Angeline was very happy because we had arrested Rukundo.  She went home because the mission had been accomplished.  You've heard about -- you've heard talk about Angeline, but you don't know him -- you don't know her.  We considered her as an officer, and we gave her the rank of a major. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You killed Emmanuel Rukundo together with whom?  What was the name of the other person that was killed? 
THE WITNESS:
It was Aristarque, he is the one that we killed, together with Rukundo, in Rukundo's house. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that is the same person whose name that we spelt previously, true? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it is the same person. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Forgive me, Witness, if I've asked you or you've given this evidence before, but can you tell us please what was the profession of Emmanuel Rukundo? 
A.	What I know is that Emmanuel Rukundo had a company called APROMAPRWA.  It was a driving school.  
Q.	Are you able to spell the name of that school? 
A.	It is a French acronym, A-P-R-O-M-A-P-R-W-A.  
Q.	Thank you.  And, do you know why he was so sought after? 
A.	I've explained this to you previously.  He was not on good terms with those women and they did not belong to the same party.  Besides he's a great friend of Sebushishi. 
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Witness, do you know of a person called André Kameya? 
A.	I know him. 
Q.	That, by the way, is 105 on the list.  Can you tell us who he is? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness is requesting the Chamber's permission to go out of the courtroom.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please do that, Mr. Witness, but we have to draw the curtain first.  
(Witness exited courtroom from 1035H to 1038H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
The next question, please? 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Can you tell us who André Kameya is -- or was? 
A.	I know André Kameya; he's the father of Laetitia Kameya.  He was a journalist. 
Q.	Was the last name that you gave Laetitia Kameya? 
A.	It is his daughter.  André Kameya is Laetitia Kameya's father. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Isn't that name usually spelt L-A-E-T-I-T-I-A?  
MS. MELLUISH:
As far as I'm aware, yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's adopt that one.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	And as far as you are aware, is André Kameya still alive or is he dead? 
A.	He's dead.  We had him brought out of the -- out of the Sainte Famille church, killed him, and he did not come back.  
Q.	Can you recall when this was? 
A.	That could well be in April or May of 1994.  We brought him out of the Sainte Famille church.  Let me give you the names of those who abducted him from that place -- if you want? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you need that, Prosecution?  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Please don't give us the name at this stage, Mr. Witness, could you simply tell us how many of you there were?  
A.	When we went to fetch him, some of us were already in the Sainte Famille church.  And another person came with a vehicle to take Mr. Kameya away.  We normally would go to the Sainte Famille church each time we wanted to ...
Q.	You would go to Sainte Famille church each time you wanted to -- what? 
A.	Each time we wanted to go and fetch people from the Sainte Famille church and kill them, we did so.  At the Sainte Famille church, there were Hutu as well as Tutsi refugees.  The Hutu refugees were in the compound of the church and they were carrying weapons.  They had firearms, which were given to them by Tharcisse Renzaho.  And there were Tutsi refugees who were inside the church building.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, when were you first made aware that Mr. Kameya was being sought? 
A.	I got to know when Michel came to the church building with the photograph of Mr. Kameya, and he went all over the place saying that we should look for that person.  May I proceed?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Asks the witness. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Please wait a moment.  Before Michel came to the Sainte Famille church, what were you doing there? 
A.	We were inside the church building where the Tutsi refugees were.  
Q.	And what were you doing inside the church building where the Tutsis refugees were? 
A.	I have told you that sometimes we'll go and select from among the Tutsis who have survived -- who had survived; that is what we were doing at that time.  We had not gone to visit them.  In a way, it was a reconnaissance visit which we were carrying out at the time.  
Q.	And how many of you were there before Michel arrived? 
A.	I was with ten persons -- I went there with a team of ten people.  
Q.	And when Michel arrived, did he arrive on his own or with anyone else? 
A.	Michel came with Odette Nyirabagenzi in Odette Nyirabagenzi's vehicle.  We came aboard other vehicles.  They found us there.  And when Michel came, he told us that one André Kameya had to be found.  
Q.	And at that time, did you know André Kameya was?  Was it a name that you recognised or not? 
A.	No, it was Michel who gave me that name and then he showed me the photograph.  And I asked him who asked him to look for Mr. Kameya, and he told me that he came with Odette.  So, we had to look for Mr. Kameya and when we found him, I wanted to know to whom he was finally entrusted. 
Q.	Where did you find Mr. Kameya? 
A.	In the church building.  
Q.	Was he hiding or was he just amongst the other refugees? 
A.	He was among the other refugees.  In fact, all the Tutsi refugees were hiding; some were there praying.  But it was a hiding place for them.  
Q.	Was it easy to find Mr. Kameya once you'd been shown his photograph? 
A.	We found him.  Sometimes when we could -- we were not able to find someone, we'll get the refugees to -- we'll send the refugees out, beat them until we find the person we are looking for.  So finally, Kameya was found.  
Q.	You said that when you found him you wanted to find out to whom he would be finally entrusted.  Did you find that out? 
A.	Yes, we entrusted him to Madam Odette Nyirabagenzi. 
Q.	And did you speak to Odette Nyirabagenzi on that occasion? 
A.	Yes, I spoke to her.  She was in the car.  She was holding a sheet of paper and on that sheet of paper there was a signature of Tharcisse Renzaho, the name of -- and the name of Tharcisse Renzaho.  Kameya climbed aboard that vehicle and we took him away.  Since the objective was to kill people, I immediately understood what was going to be done, and I did not seek to know anymore because I had just seen to whom Mr. Kameya had been entrusted.  
Q.	You mentioned a sheet of paper.  Did Odette Nyirabagenzi show that to you? 
A.	She was holding it and showed it to me.  I have just told you that I saw the name of Tharcisse Renzaho written at the bottom of the page, together with his signature.  So I'm sure it is Tharcisse Renzaho who gave her that sheet of paper, and that is why she came to look for Mr. Kameya at the church building.  
Q.	Can you recall why she showed you that piece of paper? 
A.	I went out to see to whom Mr. Kameya was to be given, and I found her outside with the piece of paper.  She was reading it -- and she didn't hide it from me.  And that is how I saw the name and signature of Mr. Tharcisse Renzaho.  And on that piece of paper, there was Mr. Kameya's name and at the bottom of the page, there was the name of Mr. Tharcisse Renzaho and his signature -- it was clear.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was only Kameya's name on that page, apart from Mr. Renzaho's name, or were there also other names? 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  It was a document on which there was Mr. Kameya's name, and at the bottom of the page, there was Mr. Tharcisse Renzaho's name and signature.  I was not able to see other names.  I only saw Mr. Kameya's name and some other writings.  I was not able to read the content of the document.  I just followed the instructions of our leader, Odette Nyirabagenzi, who asked us to give her Mr. Kameya.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was the document handwritten or typed-written? 
THE WITNESS:
It was a handwritten document.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And do you have any idea why Mr. Kameya was so important? 
THE WITNESS:
I did not ask my chief -- my leader that question, but I assumed that she knew that person.  And I assumed that the purpose for looking for him was to kill him.  And I did not dare ask my leader why we were looking for Mr. Kameya.  I could only hand over to her the person who was being sought.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Did you ever find out what happened to André Kameya after he was taken from Sainte Famille? 
A.	I did not see him again.  And besides, I could not ask my leader where he was taken.  Up until today, I did not see Mr. Kameya again.  I don't know if you know where he is, or if the person who signed the document authorising his arrest knows where he is.  But I did not see him again.  
Q.	But when I first asked you whether you knew this gentleman, you said that he was dead.  Is that just an assumption you made, or do you know that for a fact? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I have told you what happened to people who were arrested -- Tutsis who were taken from among other Tutsis.  We killed them.  We don't put them in prison.  If that person were put in prison, we would have seen him again.  So, that person could not have been hidden.  He was killed.  And, they were buried at sites which are well known.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you did not see him being killed, is that the evidence? 

THE WITNESS:
No, I did not see his killing.  But I know that the person who took him away was a killer -- just as my -- myself, because she is the one who instructed me to kill other persons.  
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, I'm about to move on to a new area.  I wonder if we could break a little early today?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much is left?  
MS. MELLUISH:
Probably another hour or 45 minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have to stop at 1 o'clock today because of a meeting, so we will then adjourn now for about 25 minutes and then continue again until 1 o'clock.  

The Court is adjourned.

(Court resumed at 1130H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Prosecution?  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Mr. Witness, -- Mr. Witness you told us earlier that you were involved in a second attack on Saint Paul at which Renzaho was present, and you said that Renzaho was present for a longer time than at the one that you've already described for us.  This second incident, could you tell the Court, if you can, when it took place?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before you do that, Mr. Witness, I just want to place on record that this break was longer than anticipated.  And the reason for that was that there were a few unexpected problems that popped up and had to be solved.  

And now the answer.  
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Mr. President.  Regarding the question that was just put to me, I was listening to what the president was saying, and I would like to crave the indulgence of the Prosecutor and ask her to repeat the question to me. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Of course.  You mentioned a second attack at Saint Paul in which you were involved, and at which Renzaho was involved or was present.  And you said that at the second attack, Renzaho was there for much longer than the previous one you've described to us.  This second attack, when did it take place? 
A.	Thank you.  The second attack -- perhaps you can look at the press at the time to know at what point there was the attack of the Inkotanyi on Saint Paul and Sainte Famille.  That was written in the press, and you can see that.  I remember that it was in the month of June, but I cannot give you an exact date.  As you know, that was a long time ago, and I cannot recall the exact date.  I can tell you what happened during the night and the following day of the attack. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's quite normal, Mr. Witness.  Do you recall whether it was the beginning, the middle, or the end of that month?  
THE WITNESS:
I believe it was the last attack that we launched against the Tutsi, and it was a large-scale attack.  I told you that it was in June.  Perhaps you can look at the press at the time.  I believe I saw a newspaper when I was in prison, but I did not pay attention to it.  I did not read it.  But I shall refer you to the archives, because I do not remember the date.  But if you go to the archives, you'll know exactly when the Inkotanyi launched an attack against Saint Paul and Sainte Famille.  And our purpose was to avenge ourselves from the Inkotanyi.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We've understood that, Mr. Witness.  You see, there is other evidence in this case.  Now we only want your explanation.  We're making now a last attempt.  Can you simply recall whether it was the first half or the second half of June?  And if you do not remember, just tell us, and we'll move on.  
THE WITNESS:
I believe it was in early June.  I do not recall the date.  But it was in June.  If we want to provide exact dates, we might end up being mistaken.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Now, you said that there was an attack by the Inkotanyi.  Were you involved in this incident before or after that attack took place, or during it?  
A.	The attack took place the day after the evacuation of the refugees by the RPF, and I told you that it was a large-scale attack.  
Q.	And you told us before that you could tell us happened that night.  Did you first become involved in the night, or in the daytime? 
A.	Whether we're talking about the attack during the night and the one on the following day, I participated in the attacks because this was a war front.  We were at war, and we were operating as if we were fighting a war. 
Q.	Can you tell us, please, how you first came to be involved in this incident? 
A.	Let me start with the attack during the night.  Around 11 p.m., Lieutenant Cadence, an ex-FAR, was posted on the road called "heavy weight" road, which is between the locality of Rugenge, and the one facing it.  He left the military position that was at that level, and we would exchange information with these soldiers in order to prevent any infiltration from the Inyenzis.  He told us that he had just seen a long line of Inkotanyi who were heading towards Sainte Famille, and that we were not to try to prevent them from advancing because there were many of them, and that they first had to be pushed away by the soldiers so that we would be able to shoot at them subsequently.  

At the roadblock, we had specific instructions to exchange information.  We had passwords that we had received from the soldiers.  They had taught us how to exchange information using such passwords.  So we used our passwords during the night the Inkotanyi entered Sainte Famille and Saint Paul and exfiltrated people.  I cannot tell you from where these people were taken, but the objective of the RPF was to he evacuate the people who were at Sainte Famille and Saint Paul.  We let them go into the two centres, or establishment, and when they went out we attacked them.  Some people who had just come out of the locations were killed and they fell in the pits.  Some people were able to escape, thanks to the Inkotanyi, and the Inkotanyi took them to their zone.  Two Inkotanyi were killed on that day, and some members of the population who were Tutsi and who were being evacuated by the Inkotanyi were also killed.  For example, for those who fell at Serutsinga where we buried them, I already testified on this incident.  There is a statement dealing with it, and if required by the Trial Chamber I can provide it with a copy of this very detailed statement on this specific incident. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The lieutenant, was that number 38?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And then the road was, I assume, Avenue des poids lourds.  

And then there was a name, Mr. Witness.  For those who fell at something.  Do we have that, Ms. Melluish?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Sorry.  I don't think I caught that. 
THE WITNESS:
We buried the people at the Serutsinga mass grave in the Rugenge secteur.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And now the spelling, please. 
THE WITNESS:
S-E-R-U-T-S-I-N-G-A.  Serutsinga.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Mr. Witness, where were you when Lieutenant Cadence came and spoke to you about the RPF approaching? 
A.	I was patrolling around the roadblocks manned by the Interahamwe.  During the night on each roadblock of the Interahamwes, we were assisted by one soldier.  So while I was moving around those roadblocks, I met Cadence, who gave me this piece of information.  Claude was off, and that is the reason Lieutenant Cadence gave me the information.  And the following day it was necessary for us to go and seek revenge because of this operation of the Inkotanyi.  There were some casualties.  I know those who shot the people who died, and I also know the names of those who died.  I believe it won't be necessary to give you the names right now, but before I leave Arusha I will indeed have given all those names to you. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Just sticking for a moment with the attack by the Inkotanyi, or the rescue operation, you were instructed by the lieutenant, I understand, not to get involved in that, is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  It was when the Inkotanyi were coming out that we shot at them.  The lieutenant had prevented us from attacking them while they were going into the sites.  It was a military tactic I am not fully conversant with.  But when the time comes, I shall give you the names of those who shot down the victims.  I don't think it's necessary to give them to you now because the Accused might make use of them for his own Defence.  Before I leave Arusha, I would like Renzaho to have confessed, and I would be very happy to hear him giving such information, and I have evidence to that effect.  
Q.	Aside from the couple of Inkotanyi that were killed, were any soldiers or Interahamwe killed whilst this raid, or rescue operation, was taking place? 
A.	No.  The Inkotanyi had a specific objective.  We were informed of that because of the soldiers.  The Inkotanyi were surprised by our attack when they were coming out.  Because when they arrived, they had arrived without any hindrance.  Nobody could have been killed amongst our forces because we were prepared.  The Inkotanyi were shooting at us in order to escape, but they didn't know where we were, whereas we knew what path they would use.  They did not have many casualties, apart from the two I mentioned, as well as some members of the population.  The Inkotanyi were able to save a number of people, you will understand that they were also quite strong.  
Q.	After -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could you speak a bit more slowly, Mr. Witness?  Thank you.  Thank you.
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	After the Inkotanyi left the area, what did you do? 
A.	After having chased the Inkotanyi from the sites, we organised a large-scale attack which targeted Saint Paul and Sainte Famille, and that was the second attack that was launched against Saint Paul.  There were very many of us, around 180 people, and we launched an attack coming from all sides on the site.  
Q.	You said that you organised an attack.  Did you meet together and discuss what was going to happen? 
A.	No, we did not meet.  I told you that we had started operating at higher speed.  We would operate very rapidly and implement instructions.  There were enough of us, and we had enough equipment -- 
Q.	Did you receive any instructions? 
A.	-- so that we encountered no difficulty.  
Q.	Did you receive any instructions? 
A.	Cadence himself told us that the following morning we were to go to Sainte Famille and Saint Paul in order to try and locate the Inyenzi who might have stayed there, as well as their accomplices.  And talking about accomplices, he was referring to the Tutsi.  He asked us to look for these people and to kill them all.  So that was the objective of our attack.  Renzaho was there, Munyakaze was there, Bivamvagara was also there, and Lieutenant Cadence was also there, of course.  And we, and our leaders, that is to say Odette Nyirabagenzi and Angeline, we were all there.  
Q.	What time, do you recall, did you launch this attack? 
A.	During the morning, we did not wait until daybreak.  At seven we were already there.  We were already at Sainte Famille and Saint Paul around seven.  I do not know whether you wish for me to tell you which itinerary we followed.  I will give this itinerary to Renzaho when the time comes.  
Q.	Please, I would like you to give your itinerary.  Where did you go first? 
A.	We destroyed the fence that separated the CELA centre from Saint Paul.  It was easy to reach Saint Paul either by the road uphill, or downhill.  Everywhere there were paths leading to those locations, we blocked them so as to prevent the Inyenzis from escaping.  We circled the locations, and the gendarmes who were led by Bivamvagara went on the side of the exit of -- near the church.  They went by Pan Africa and the hall where people were housed, and all this in order to make sure that the Inyenzi would not escape.  As for us, we circled the CELA centre, the convent of the sisters, as well as the presbytery.  We circled -- or surrounded all of those locations so as to dislodge the Inyenzis who might have stayed there, as well as the Tutsi who were hiding, and we were not sorting anyone at that stage.  When we got this, we noted that the Hutu refugees who were at Sainte Famille were already ready to assist us, and there are people to whom Renzaho had distributed weapons.  When the time comes, I shall give you the names of such individuals, and if Renzaho so wishes perhaps he can call them as witnesses.  You can now continue putting questions to me.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, yes, Mr. Witness.  Now, what kind of fence was it?  
THE WITNESS:
I heard that the fence was rebuilt, but I can give you a description of what it looked like.  I am still quite young, and I do remember all that occurred. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  What did the fence look like in June 1994?  
THE WITNESS:
Very well.  The fence between Saint Paul and Sainte Famille was made of bricks.  It was a brick wall.  But elsewhere, there was barbed wire which was used for the fence. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So does this mean that there was barbed wire between CELA and Saint Paul?  Is that the evidence?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  Between Saint Paul and the CELA centre, there was -- there were metallic posts and barbed wire, but it was later replaced by a brick wall.  But on the side of the wood, there was no fence.  So we could go in without any problem.  And at the location where CELA joins with Saint Paul, there was a small house, and there was a hole through which we could pass.  As for Sainte Famille, you see the road that leads to the Saint Paul centre, there was a small entrance. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  You have answered the question. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Mr. Witness, could you try to speak a little bit more slowly, and perhaps tell the story a little bit more slowly for us?  Now, when you went through into Saint Paul from CELA, what did you do at Saint Paul?  
A.	We implemented the instructions that were given to us.  That is to say, dislodge each and every Tutsi we would find there, or any Inyenzi, in order to kill them.  That is all we did.  We dislodged them, as was indicated to us.  Now, who came to our assistance?  Well, there were the Hutu refugees who had come from Kibuye and who had fled from the areas that had been conquered by the RFP, and these refugees helped us.  I stated that they had helped us.  They had equipment.  And some of these people, fortunately, have confessed and are about to testify against Renzaho; which means that even if I had not testified against him, these people would.  
Q.	Can you recall how many refugees you dislodged from Saint Paul? 
A.	It is difficult to give you a figure.  A lot of people came to assist us who came from Muhima and other secteurs, because they got to know that Inkotanyi had attacked the Sainte Famille church and Saint Paul.  Some came from Gikondo, who came to seek refuge in Rugenge.  All these people assisted us.  I managed to know where they had thrown the bodies of those who were killed, and it was at the CND, at Iyaremye, Straton's, place that these bodies were thrown.  Others died on the road.  And Renzaho, Tharcisse, himself, who was the préfet, made vehicles available to carry the dead bodies.  And I will be giving him the names of those persons he requested to remove the bodies.  Laurent Munyakaze himself took some people from the Saint Famille parish.  He even carried some bodies.  And Munyakaze explained himself on some of these incidents.  And if Renzaho wants to know this, I'll give him the evidence, and he can also explain why he made vehicles available for the bodies to be carried.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We really do not need these references to Mr. Renzaho all the time, Mr. Witness.  What is the next question?  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	When you were at Saint Paul, did you see Renzaho? 
A.	I saw him.  If I did not see him, I would have told you. 
Q.	Well, can you tell us where you saw him, and what he was doing? 
A.	He came to the Saint Paul centre.  And after we killed those Tutsis who had taken refuge at that place, Renzaho came to that place when the bodies were still strewn all over the place. 
Q.	And what did he do? 
A.	He did nothing.  We brought out three bodies in front of him, and he said nothing.  It was not something surprising for him, because he knew that we normally killed those people, and he is the one who gave us the instructions.  If he did not support our activities, he would have prevented us from doing it.  And if you wish, I will go and show you the site.  He cannot say anything, because he supported what we were doing.  
Q.	Are you sure it was at Saint Paul that you saw Renzaho, and not Sainte Famille? 
A.	He came to those two places, the Saint Paul centre, as well as the Saint Famille parish.  He came all the way into the Sainte Famille church building, and he saw the three bodies that they were taking out.  But he also -- there were other bodies at that place.  And if you wish, I will give you the names of the persons who were accompanying him. 
Q.	Now, I just want it to be entirely clear to everyone in this courtroom, the order of events.  Now, you went from CELA to Saint Paul, and there you said that you found and killed some refugees.  You also said you saw Renzaho at Saint Paul.  Did you, then, go to Sainte Famille, or had you already been there?  
A.	Saint Famille parish and the Saint Paul centre are virtually at the same place, and I was free to move around, go wherever I wished to go.  No one could chase -- no one could chase me around.  On the contrary, I was chasing people around.  I was free to move around and I could go anywhere at any time.  And I knew -- I could see what was happening.  I got instructions from Angeline Mukandutiye, and during that period Mukandutiye and Nyirabagenzi were supported by the préfet, so I did not have to hide.  I could do everything in broad daylight. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Even if those two locations are very close, you must have arrived at one of them first.  Which one was that, Sainte Famille or Saint Paul?  That's the question.  Just give us that answer without any further explanation.  Where did you arrive first?  
THE WITNESS:
I first went to the Saint Paul centre before going to the Saint Famille parish. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Now, when you went to the Saint Famille parish, can you estimate how many, if any, refugees there were there?  
A.	We were no longer counting refugees.  We were, rather, killing them.  There were many refugees, some of them were inside the church building, others were already dead.  I recall Yacinthe, the daughter of Charles Rwanga, had already been killed.  She was nicknamed "bébé", and she had been killed.  And at that time, they instructed us to shoot into the group of refugees.  We no longer had to sort them out.  We were afraid that there were Inyenzis who had infiltrated and who were there.  
Q.	Who instructed you to shoot? 
A.	It was Claude and Cadence who told us to shoot.  They were my leaders, and I could not but obey their instructions.  
Q.	Can you estimate how many people were killed at Sainte Famille? 
A.	I did not count those who were killed at the Saint Famille parish.  It was not for us -- we did not kill these people, but there were some bodies which were taken to the CND and killed there.  It was -- it was the lieutenant who supervised the carrying of these bodies and their burial.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you say that Yacinthe was nicknamed "bébé"? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, we nicknamed her "bébé".  She was a neighbour.  Her first name was Yacinthe, but we normally called her bébé.  

BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Your pronouncement -- answer has been translated, at least, as saying "we did not kill these people".  Is it right that you didn't kill -- the Interahamwe did not kill any of the refugees at Sainte Famille, or has that been reported --
A.	That is not what I said.  There must have been a problem of interpretation.  I said "we killed those people", I did not say that we did not kill them.  
Q.	And can you tell the Court how many people you killed yourself?  
A.	***************************************************************************************************************
	***************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************.  It's the same if you ask me who Renzaho or Odette killed personally.  There would be no answer to that.  But they are responsible because they were leaders of groups of killers.  I'm one of those killers, and that is why I pleaded guilty.  So you shouldn't make a distinction between myself and those who actually pulled the trigger and shot at those people.  
Q.	Now, how long had you been at Sainte Famille when you saw Renzaho there for the first time?  
A.	I had just spent about 30 minutes at the Saint Famille parish when Renzaho came.  We were looking at the dead bodies, and that is when I recognised the body of Yacinthe.  And when Renzaho came to the church building, he remained there for about an hour.  Counsel for the Prosecution, did you ask me another question?  
Q.	No, Mr. Witness.  Can you tell us, please, where it was in the Sainte Famille complex that you first saw Renzaho there? 
A.	He was close to the water tank, which was within the premises of the Saint Famille parish.  It was very close to the sacristy. 
(Pages 25 to 32 by Vicki Eastvold)














1215H 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	And what was he doing? 
A.	Renzaho was standing, talking to other persons. 
Q.	And do you know who those other persons were? 
A.	Yes, I know them.  I know who these people were. 
Q.	What kind of people were they? 
A.	There was Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka, who worked closely with Renzaho, particularly regarding what was happening at the parish.  It was Father Munyeshyaka who was giving us information on the number of Tutsi who came to the church building and was giving us their names because he know them -- he knew them.  And he was telling Renzaho the same thing.  And when he gave us that information, then we would look for the Tutsis.  Odette and Angeline, the father -- the parish priest and Father Wenceslas, they were with Renzaho discussing.  
Q.	And do you know for how long these people were together with Renzaho discussing? 
A.	I told you that they spoke for a long time and that Renzaho stayed there for about an hour. 
Q.	And do you know what he did after that? 
A.	I wouldn't know what he did.  He was with my leaders.  I was a respectful person and I was not going to join in their conversation.  I was about five metres from where they were. 
Q.	So, is it right that you didn't see him do anything else after that conversation? 
A.	No, he spoke to those persons.  He looked at the three dead bodies.  Those who were with him also looked at the bodies, but let me add that those three persons entered into the church building and told him what happened in the church building.  There was nothing else he could do.  He came after we had killed the people. 
Q.	And do you know why they were looking at the bodies? 
A.	I wouldn't know.  I don't know because I was not party to their conversation.  My leader, who give me instructions, was with them.  So they are the ones who know why they sent us to the church building.  I could not join in their conversation or listen to their conversation. 
Q.	After this incident at Sainte Famille, did you ever see Renzaho again? 
A.	No.  After this incident at the Sainte Famille parish, I did not see Renzaho again.  Up until when I fled, I did not meet -- I did not see Renzaho again.  However, I am able to tell you that Renzaho had the authority to prevent us from committing the act that we committed, because he was the highest-ranking person among all those persons.  That is what I can tell you.  He knew everything that was happening.  If he did not know, he would have prevented us from doing so or he could even have killed us.  He was the most important person among -- in that whole group. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Could the witness be shown this book of photographs, please?  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Mr. Witness, could you look at the first photograph in this book?  The booklet's numbered 1 in the bottom right-hand corner.  Have a look at it.  Could you tell us if you recognise anybody pictured there? 
A.	I cannot recognise anybody. 
Q.	Do you know what kind people these are from looking at the -- 
A.	They are Interahamwes, my colleagues. 
Q.	And what is about them that makes you say they are Interahamwes when you don't recognise any of them individually? 
A.	I recognise them from their uniform and other things they are wearing.  These are no soldiers because there are no military insignia on the uniform.  We Interahamwes sometimes wear military uniform but we had no military insignia.  I know what happened during that period.  I know -- I can see some who are wearing civilian clothes and others wearing military uniforms, and I believe they are Interahamwes.  
Q.	And could you just look at picture number 5?  Have you got number 5 there?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Are these Interahamwe or soldiers or anyone else?  Can you tell from the picture? 
A.	They are Interahamwes -- (no interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it disputed that these photographs show Interahamwe?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Am I to respond, Mr. President? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President, I believe the Defence position is known.  We believe that this could be -- have been organised by what is referred to as the Interahamwe, so we do not agree with the reasoning which is being demonstrated through these photographs.  But at the appropriate time, the Prosecution will indicate its position clearly.  For now, we just think it is an illustration of what is referred to as Interahamwe.  But we are not very certain that that refers to what was called Interahamwe.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  
MS. MELLUISH: 
I have no further questions, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
There are no exhibits to be tendered in connection with this testimony. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honours, no, these photos will be exhibited next week.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence?  
JUDGE ARREY: 
Witness, you told the Court that in June you were in the Saint Paul church when Michel came with the photograph look for a certain journalist, and you said that you were in the church for reconnaissance.  Can you explain to the church what this means?  What were you doing in the church, you the Interahamwes?  
THE WITNESS:
The Interahamwe and myself, we were trying to look -- to identify or localise or determine the position of some Tutsi who had fled.  So we wanted to find them and report to Angeline that we have found some of them and then take further instructions regarding them, and that is what I referred to as a reconnaissance mission and that is what I was doing there.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
Thank you.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness, can the Defence of Tharcisse Renzaho consider that today it is meeting one of the persons who in 1994 may be characterised as a foot soldier of Mr. Renzaho?  Can we consider you as being such a person today? 
A.	I don't know the -- the specific characterisation that you want to give.  I came here for a specific reason.  I came here to speak to the acts that I committed, together with my colleagues.  I don't know if the characterisation you are giving is the one given to you by your client sitting by you, Counsel.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Are you able to tell the Chamber how you at that time committed -- how did you consider Mr. Renzaho?  Was he your leader?  What kind of relationship existed between you and him?  
A.	Thank you.  Renzaho was the chief of my chief who gave me a specific position.  So I had a lot of respect for Renzaho, as well as my immediate chief. 
Q.	And you then from a military standpoint, you said that once committed, you got involved in weapon-handling courses, is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.  Yes, I received training in Angeline's house.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  How long did it take for you -- how long did it take for you to consider that at the end of that training you were able to handle weapons?  
A.	I was young and I had an active mind, so it did not take me a long time.  They taught us how to disassemble a weapon, how to assemble it and how to fire.  They did not teach us immediately to target; it took us some time.  
Q.	Are you saying, Witness, that it took you one day to learn -- to fire -- to shoot a firearm? 
A.	In the course of one day I have learnt to disassemble, clean and reassemble a firearm.  That took me one day.  
Q.	Did you finally have to use that weapon without training -- or, let's me put it this way:  How long -- how many days did it take you to be able to use it? 
A.	Not more than five days.  
Q.	You must have been very intelligent, Witness.  And that probably is the reason why you went up the ladder very quickly in your group.  
A.	I told you about the person who appointed me to the position I occupied and I told you about the relationship between us.  As far as my intelligence is concerned, genocide was not perpetrated because of intelligence.  Anyone who could commit genocide did so.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, on account of the personal relationship that existed between you and that person, you get into the group on -- can you remind me of the exact date on which you joined the group again, Witness?  
A.	Regarding the date on which I joined the militia group, I would say it was between the 8th and the 9th.  I am not in charge of recording dates, but I remember those dates.  There are other events which occurred, but which do not relate to the trial here which I have been able to explain here -- several events actually.  
Q.	You have told the Chamber that you were requested by that person to replace your brother.  Is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And you indicated that that brother of yours had been shot down.  Am I correct? 
A.	My brother was not shot down.  He went into exile.  He fled, and I am ready to provide evidence to you to that effect. 
Q.	Witness, I wonder whether this is a problem.  In the transcript -- perhaps he was not shot down, but I thought I heard yesterday that your brother was deceased.  Was that not your testimony yesterday?  
A.	Counsel, with all due respect, my brother who was hit by a stray bullet was my younger brother.  But as for my older brother, he fled and I will explain to you how you collaborated with the political parties.  But I would be talking about other cases, which I can give you the name of my younger brother who was killed, and I can also give you the name of my older brother who collaborated with Mukandituye, Angeline.  
Q.	Witness, I believe we will require clarifications on this matter, unless you were mistaken yesterday.  I wish to read out to you the answer you give -- gave to madam the Prosecutor following a question she put to you.  I would like to refer to yesterday's transcript, page 60 French version, line 15 -- lines 15 and 16.  Here's a question put to you by the Prosecutor, Witness:  "Was there any special reason why you joined the group of Interahamwe?"  And this is your answer:  "Yes, there was one specific reason.  My older brother had just died.  The person in charge of the Interahamwe, who was a school inspector in Nyarugenge, and whose name was Angeline Mukandituye asked me to come to her assistance.  My elder brother, who had worked with her before the war, before multiparty democracy, had just separated from her, and Angeline was a great friend of the family."  

I am not going any further than that.  This is the end of quotation.  Do you recall having made such a testimony yesterday?  
A.	Truth be told, I agree that my elder brother worked with Angeline and that he collaborated with the CDR party.  When he left home, he had not been killed; he went to seek refuge at Gitarama.  And I can give you the name of my younger brother, who was shot down.  I think we should correct the transcripts.  
Q.	You stated yesterday, that your older brother had died.  Did you make a mistake then? 
A.	I did not say that he was dead.  Perhaps I didn't express myself correctly, or perhaps you misunderstood me.  My older brother left the country and he went to Congo.  It is my younger brother who was shot down, and I can give you his name.  When would my older brother have died and what would be the cause of his death?  I am ready to give you this information, unless you tell me that you killed him. 
Q.	When was it that your older brother went to Congo, Witness?  
A.	He first went to Gitarama, and he left Gitarama with the others.  So you shouldn't ask me exactly when.  Perhaps you should ask me when it was that he left our family home. 
Q.	So, Witness, when was it that he left your home?
A.	He left on the 8th at 3 p.m., and I was the one who gave him his bag in Gitarama.  
Q.	Did you go to Gitarama with him? 
A.	No, I did not go with him, but I joined him there.  And I knew exactly where he was in Gitarama.  I can tell you where.  And if that is your wish, I can tell you why I went there and what reason brought me there. 
Q.	What about your younger brother you are now referring to.  When was it that he was shot down? 
A.	He was not shot down by the Interahamwe.  He was hit by a stray bullet which hit him from we don't know where.  We don't know where the bullet came from.  I am not accusing of anyone of having shot him down.  He died as a result of an accident, and if you wish for me to tell you where he was buried, I can do so.  
Q.	So when was that, Witness?  On what date?  
A.	If you are still referring to my younger brother, I don't know what you wish to know.
Q.	Yes, it is indeed your younger brother I am referring to, Witness.  
A.	My younger died in May.  I cannot tell you the date with certainly.  I was not under the obligation to remember all the dates.  
Q.	So yesterday when you were referring to one of your brothers who had died, it could not have been your younger brother who died in May and not in April when you joined Mrs. Mukandituye? 
A.	I don't have any younger brother who died in April.  My younger brother died in May.  His friends of the same age are still alive, and so are his parents, and we know where he was buried.  You should not put words into my mouth. 
Q.	Witness, when you were testifying before the Trial Chamber yesterday that one of your brothers -- and let us not refer to your older brother, since you do not acknowledge having said so -- had just died, I put the question to you earlier on and you said that this could only have been related to your younger brother.  What I am asking you now is whether you were indeed alluding to your younger brother when you were answering the question put to you by the Prosecutor yesterday.  
A.	I have a feeling you did not follow what was being said in this courtroom while it was your duty.  I told you when my younger brother died, under what conditions, and I don't know what you are driving at.  
Q.	Witness, I take note of your answer on this matter, and I would now like to move on to your knowledge in weapons, since you were able to use such weapons in less than five days.  Can you tell us what is the difference between the three types of guns you mentioned yesterday? 
A.	Even if you were to mix up the different spare parts of such guns, I can still distinguish them from one another, but I am not ready to use a firearm again.  I don't know whether you want to know what different types of weapons there were or whether you have another aim. 
Q.	I would like to know about the different types of weapons, Witness.  Could you tell me more about Kalashnikov rifles, for example? 
A.	Let me answer your question regarding the Kalashnikov guns.  If you look at the butt of such guns, there is a trigger on which you push in order to take off the latch, security latch, and then you arm the weapon so that the bullet will get out of the chamber and so that you might not shoot yourself.  And it is only after having carried out such operations that you can clean your weapon.  Then you can take the different parts of your gun, take your reserve bullet, put it in the barrel, and then you can leave with your gun.  Before opening fire you should take off the safety latch and then you can shoot, and it is the safety latch that shows you that the Kalashnikov can be used to shoot several bullets.  I don't know whether you have followed me or whether you need further explanations.  
Q.	I followed you, Witness, and I would like to put another question to you.  What is the -- how many bullets can one put in the magazine of a Kalashnikov? 
A.	Thirty.  That is child's play.  
Q.	And what's the difference between the magazine of an F -- R4, G3 and AK47 rifles? 
A.	What is an AK47?  I do not believe I referred to any AK47.  I referred to the G3, the FAL, the Kalashnikov, and the R4.  Do not include other weapons I did not mention.  Your client has followed a number of trainings on firearms, but not me.  
Q.	How can you identify a Kalashnikov?  
A.	Yes.  Well, if the Trial Chamber is ready to give me the different types of weapons, perhaps I can show you the difference.  I saw a photograph on which such arms are shown, perhaps I can tell you about them.  And, besides, your client, who is right beside you, was a colonel, so I believe he can provide you with further explanations. 
Q.	Witness, I wish things to be clear between the two of us.  When I am putting questions to you it is in order for you to enlighten the Trial Chamber, and that is why I will ask you to refrain from referring to my client on each and every occasion.  Can we follow such a procedure?  
A.	I shall not make your task difficult.  But I am ill and I would like to be able to get out of the courtroom in order to relieve myself, and then I would be ready to stay in this courtroom until you are able to understand the ins and outs of the genocide.  Please grant me some time for me to be able to relieve myself.  I am not able to answer your question because I am under pressure.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will draw the curtains first, Mr. Witness.  
(Witness exited courtroom)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
While the witness is outside the courtroom.  Yesterday the Prosecution, listing the witnesses for next week, mentioned that DBN was the first followed by BX.  Is that still the case?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there any need to ask DBN to come Monday morning or is it sufficient to ask him to come in the afternoon?  What is the estimate of the Defence based on projected time for cross-examination?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Well, Mr. President, if I were to give you an estimate it would be between two hours and two hours and 30 minutes.
(Witness entered courtroom)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. You are not bound by that, of course.  But then the witness should be brought around 10:30.  

Mr. Witness, here follows the next question.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Yes, Witness, before you left the courtroom, I do not recall whether you had answered my question.  I was asking you how you were able to identify a Kalashnikov.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  The butt of such guns is wooden.  And as for the way the gun looks, in fact, it would be easy if I had guns before me to tell you:  This is a Kalashnikov; this is an F4; this is a G3; or this is an FAL gun.  I have just spent more than ten years in prison, perhaps I should be shown the photo album I had before me.  And if you come next to me, and if the Judges so wish, I can show you the different types of weapons that appear in such photographs.  

MR. NEKUIE: 
That will not be necessary, Mr. President, because I am putting questions to the witness regarding the training he received in the handling of weapons. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, may I ask you what was -- what is the first lesson one receives when one receives training in the handling of weapons?  
A.	You should not lead me to talk about military matters.  Our objective was merely to know how to shoot a bullet.  We were not being trained to become soldiers.  We were being trained to kill people.  You should not ask us questions that are much too complex.  One had to know how to put (sic) a magazine apart, or how to take off the parts of a firearm rapidly, but that was all.  There was no other type of combat for us.  The objective was just to kill people.  
Q.	Witness, you stated before this Trial Chamber that you were trained in the handling of weapons, and that is why I wish for you to remind the Trial Chamber of the contents of such courses.  So, can you answer me in a specific way:  What is the first course taken when one is trained to handle weapons? 
A.	First of all, we were told that a gun was something specific -- special, because if we did not handle it with care it could lead to our own death.  First of all, you are taught how to hold the weapon and how to maintain it.  
Q.	So, in your training, you were not told that the first lesson was to identify the weapon by its number before looking at its specifications?  You were never taught such a thing? 
A.	As regards the number on the gun we would receive, there was one location where the weapons would be placed.  So we would note down somewhere the name of the person as well as the type of weapon that person received; but we did not pay any attention to the serial number of such weapons.  ****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************.  
Q.	And since you were *************************************************, in addition, Witness, while you were making such notes, you only noted down regarding the Kalashnikovs -- 
A.	Kalashnikov?  I told you how we were using the equipment.  What we were to pay attention to was the different bullets that were to be used with different types of weapons.  And there are some bullets that be used in different types of guns.  What we were interested in was to know that X or Y had received such-and-such a gun; otherwise, we were not trained in complex military matters.  Why would we have been taught such difficult things when there were gendarmes and soldiers who were assisting us?  Our work -- our job was merely to kill people, and we would do so without any major problem.  It is now that we are paying the consequences of what we had done -- what we did.  But, at the time, we had no problem whatsoever.  
Q.	Who was your instructor, Witness?  
A.	There were many people who would train us.  There were people who went for training at Gabiro.  For example, Claude, he was a lieutenant and he had been a soldier.  Do you think it would have been difficult for a lieutenant to say, "Well, this is how you handle a weapon."  I believe this was something quite straightforward for him.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you now refer to Gabiro or Ngabire, Mr. Witness?  What was the location you just referred to?  
THE WITNESS:  
Gabiro.  There are people who went to undergo military training at Gabiro, and I am ready to provide the names of those who were trained at Gabiro by the ministry of defence, if counsel so wishes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have to adjourn for today, and we will continue, Monday, at 8:45.  

May I ask everyone to note that on Monday we will not be sitting in this courtroom, but in courtroom 4 on the ground floor, probably only for one day, possibly two.  The reason for the venue change is that the Chamber presently using courtroom 4 need this courtroom because of a video link connection.  

So I wish everyone a good weekend.  

Mr. Witness, you, too.  And please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you.  

The Court is adjourned.
(Court adjourned at 1300H)
