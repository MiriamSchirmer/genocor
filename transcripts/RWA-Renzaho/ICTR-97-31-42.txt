P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, the Court is in session.  

Before proceeding with the examination-in-chief, I should just mention that we need to delete a few words from the transcripts of yesterday, and this is on page 35 of the provisional transcripts.  

The problem was that Witness ALG could, because of an element mentioned by the Accused, be identified.  So for that reason, in the paragraph in the middle of that page, which starts: 

"Now, as regards initiatives, we should place ourselves in the context of April to July of 1994", that sentence remains untouched.  And then the next sentence reads:  "Events took place in this small area of the commune led by ALG", and the rest of that sentence should be deleted because the reference to a secteur would identify the commune; that was the problem.  

Good morning, Mr. Renzaho. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maître Cantier, you have the floor. 
MR. CANTIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
THARCISSE RENZAHO,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, we'll carry on the exercise that we were doing yesterday, which consisted of putting questions to you on the speeches you made and the interviews you granted -- interviews that were commented upon by Prosecution witness, Alison Des Forges.  

Now, I'm going to read to you a passage that is found in the interview of 18 June 1994, and it is Prosecution Exhibit P. 62, which is in the folder of the Prosecution, volume 3, tab 16.  I am referring to a paragraph, which in the French version is found on page 28.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the English version? 
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I -- I did not find that exhibit, the English version thereof.  So, right now, I don't know whether it exists or whether it is only the French version that is in the records.  So the reference for the French document -- the only one I have -- is K0368041. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There is an English version of P. 62.  So why don't you indicate approximately where we are in the document and we will find it.  
MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, I've located it in the English, and I believe it is on page 4 of the English, the second paragraph, commencing, "Thank you".  It is K0377212.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Very good, thank you.  

Please go ahead, Maître.  
MR. CANTIER:
I do apologise, Mr. President.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I'm going to read out the passage that I would like you to comment upon.  
A.	Thank you.  
Q.	"Thus far we've given enough directives regarding identification documents, and I have discussed this issue on several occasions.  The identity paper that is required at roadblocks is the identity card, and the information on the identity card, as described by the law -- and that law has still not been modified.  

"I would like to inform members of the population that there is a new method that the Inyenzis are using to disguise themselves.  They send spies into zones that they do not control.  They often use Hutus or other persons carrying identity cards with the Hutu ethnic tribe mentioned in them, because they know that persons described as such would not encounter problems during checks."

Mr. Renzaho, first, can you tell the Chamber in what context you made that statement?  What was the objective you sought when you made the statement, knowing that the Prosecution expert witness stated that what you meant was that persons of Tutsi ethnic origin would encounter difficulties? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel, for your question.  The context in which I made that statement was a war context, the war that was going on in the city of Kigali; a war within a major urban centre, whose technique consisted in sending in reconnaissance or elements, or infiltrated agents to carry out special duties that the perpetrators had planned.  

At the same time, we recorded incursions within the country, and this was constant in the reports of UNAMIR.  You'll find a series of so-called rescue operations, especially at the end of April, but also in June, those operations were stepped up at that time.  So, it means that these operations were actually happening, and also incurred a lot of loss of human lives.  
So, the assailants came in and with the use of pre-established lists, picked up persons that they were supposed to carry back to the area of the RPF.  But at the same time, the population was well served.  So (inaudible), apart of Nyakibanda, Muhima and other areas -- those operations added to the tension that was already palpable within the population and stepped up the intensity of the killing within the population.  

So, I had to give that instruction to the population.  It was the same instruction that was proposed at the frontline, so that care should be taken at the roadblocks where most of those people were passing to avoid any confusion between the whole lot.  

It was obvious that the identity card had always been an official document that people presented at any checkpoint.  But, the novelty was that these infiltrated persons used other cards that were impounded or delivered elsewhere.  In fact, without these measures, they were communed in the occupied areas, and the technique used was that all documents in the occupied areas -- documents were -- were stolen from these areas and used by the -- the elements that were supposed to carry out missions in areas that were not controlled by the RPF.  

So, the -- the measure was aimed at stepping up vigilance at the roadblocks to avoid excesses -- or, at least, to help people -- to control -- to check people rigorously, because once more, a check up is a mission.  But again, there was a different attitude because any defaulting case had to be referred to the administration.  

If they didn't do that, that was their problem.  But the measure was dictated at that moment as these people had to be checked at the roadblocks so they couldn't engage in excesses and to maltreat innocent persons; that was the problem.  Thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, what witness Alison Des Forges says in her historical analysis is that the kind of statement you made could be considered an incitement to hunt down Tutsis.  What is your answer to that? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And when you answer that question now, Mr. Renzaho, please slow down and be briefer.  Will you make an attempt, please? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I'll do that, Mr. President.  
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, I'm sorry, I can't see your microphone when it goes on, so I do apologise.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Renzaho, my question is:  The kind of statement you made, and the -- the check -- the kind of check that was done, could it not be considered as some type of incitement to hunt down Tutsis? 
A.	Counsel, I pray you to consider that this message came out in June, if my -- if I still remember correctly.  And in June, we had already organised, in the city of Kigali, a refugee exchange operation on both sides of the -- of the frontline.  

Well, this has not been mentioned, but I also said something to the population to the effect that they should support the refugee exchange operation in the sense that the extremely serious situation in which we lived, prompted a lot more humanism, and that the population had to support that operation and understand that people had the right to go to any part of the country they wanted.  

So, I find it difficult to understand how in June, when we were moving almost towards the end of the battle of Kigali, I would start inciting the population to hunt down Tutsis, whereas rescue operations had been undertaken or were underway to help those people -- and, measures had been successfully undertaken to address the problems that we had had.  And when such measures were not able to address all these problems, how do I understand that in June, I was impertinent enough to ask or to incite the population to hunt down Tutsis.  To my mind, it's something that I can't understand.  Thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, please, try again, to be brief and concise, even -- even if the question is a bit complex.  

I will now put it to you:  Don't you think that this charge, that has some kind of double language, is justified in the sense that in the rest of your radio interview, the population observed that members of the commune -- notably, continued to give their blessing to the killings and they were not bothered at all?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you suggesting an answer to Mr. Renzaho, Maître Cantier? 
MR. CANTIER:
No, Mr. President, not at all, if I'm suggesting an answer, it will be in the negative.  

Now, simply, Mr. President, it's trying to get into the discussion on doublespeak; that is the charge that was made through witness Alison Des Forges and that is what she said.  So, if I'm suggesting something, it would be to answer "yes".  Mr. President, Honourable Judges, my question is to allow Mr. Renzaho to explain himself on the difficult issues.  I'm not asking any leading questions. 
MR. MOSES:
It might be more helpful to us all if it was framed in a way by pointing us to the transcript which my friend says such a comment was made, and asking for a comment on that.  Otherwise, it's somewhat difficult to follow which particular part of the interview my friend is referring to.  

MR. CANTIER:
My learned colleague, I have read through all the transcripts of Madam Alison Des Forges's cross-examination and examination-in-chief.  I've read the -- the transcripts, but I didn't come with the exact references.  But the issues of doublespeak was addressed by that witness, and it is a recurrent topic, especially in this trial.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Renzaho, is there doublespeak in your intervention?  Is there a hidden message there? 
THE WITNESS:
No, Mr. President, maybe I should give you my own understanding of the issue, because if you say something and people interpret it some other way, I think these are two different things.  The doublespeak or double meaning with regard to the events that were happening, as people are saying -- well, it is true.  There may have been people within the administration who were involved in the events.  

We have some witnesses who have come here and testified to cases that I learnt only here at this Tribunal.  The person who observes while listening to a message -- a message on -- which asked the people not to be involved in excesses, and which sees another member of the administrative apparatus involved in criminal acts would -- and when such a person hears that measures should be taken against such persons that infringe on the law -- and, then, if he does not see the measures taken, then he compares the two:  The message he heard, and the attitude of the administrative elements.  

Then, he feels that there is some double meaning, whereas he may then conclude that the person who gave out the message is manipulating the population or lying; that is the problem.  So, having stated the problem, I would like to point out a few illustrations and extrapolate on what may have led to the charges against me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you do that, the follow-up by Maître Cantier would probably now have been -- but, all right, some persons might interpret your message in a particular way, and isn't it then a task for the person speaking to be absolutely clear to avoid misinterpretation?  What is your comment on that?  

And then, Maître Cantier can decide whether he wants these examples that you are about to give afterwards.  But what is the answer to that particular question I just asked you? 
THE WITNESS:
Interpretation -- well, anybody can interpret it; that is what I said.  A person who observed the members of an administrative structure committing criminal acts at a time when these officials give instructions -- and then, the person committing the act is not punished -- I feel that the observer may interpret it.  I mean, we are all human and it may happen.  

BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Renzaho, what you think -- is that what you thought at the time of the event or is it your analysis after the fact right now? 
A.	That is the analysis I make now.  After listening to Madam Des Forges's commentary, I tried to interpret Madam Des Forges' analysis in the light of the events that I experienced.  
Q.	Now, at the time of the events, because it is on that basis that you are being tried, were you aware -- were you precisely aware of that situation and that possible misunderstanding on the part of the population? 
A.	Counsel, I believe that if I was aware that any member of the administration was engaged in criminal acts, I would not stop at telling the population the attitude to adopt in the face of such events.  

I would have also cited examples, and citing the example of the one who was carrying out criminal acts and punished him precisely to demonstrate that what I was saying was not just talk, but precise instructions that had to be respected.  That is the problem.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Renzaho.  I believe that, for now, your answer is sufficient for us.  

Now sir, during the events were you in contact with what we call here "the Interahamwe" or some of their leaders? 
A.	No.  
Q.	But there's the question, why?  Whereas you were in charge of maintaining order and security and members of that organisation were at the origin of such insecurity, how do you explain that? 
A.	Counsel, I would like to say that the way things were done at the Kigali city préfecture, with regard to the youth movements of political parties, was in terms of peace -- the same as in times of war.  

In the past, before 6 April 1994, we had spoken to leaders of political parties when it came to problems related to the youth -- the youth of those parties.  And in this case, with respect to the Interahamwe youth of the MRND, I will refer you to a memo I wrote to the chairman of the MRND in Kigali préfecture.  I think you can find that document.  

If, at that time, I was doing what you say, how would I have had informal relations with anybody?  Because that is the second part of the question:  Who were the Interahamwe in April -- from April to July 1994?  And that is the problem that compounds the situation:  Who were the Interahamwe between April and July 1994?  Because apart from the population of Kigali, who were surprised in the neighbourhood by the fighting, I'm saying that we had recorded movements of the population who came in from outside in huge numbers -- in bigger numbers than the -- the population of the city of Kigali.  

Imagine hundreds of thousands of people who came from Nyacyonga.  And, later on, the people from Nyacyonga started coming into the city from 10 April 1994 -- or, 19-20, following the fall of the Byumba garrison, all the people who had fled to seek refuge with the soldiers now fled towards Kigali with the soldiers.  And then, we had another wave; that wave came in at the same time with another wave from the east -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
He mentioned a name, I didn't get that, Mr. President.  
THE WITNESS:
Then, after the 23rd, we had another wave of refugees from the refugees of Camp Kanombe because that garrison fell into the hands of the RPF.  And so, this entire population came and settled in the small pocket of resistance that remained, and I have some trouble identifying that all these people would be Interahamwe.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Renzaho.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You referred to the fall of a garrison.  Could you just repeat its name?  I'm not thinking of 
Camp Kanombe now, but the first reference you made? 
THE WITNESS:
I mentioned, Djumba (phonetic), B-Y-U-B-A (sic).  
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, that is the city of Byumba, 69. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	But, Mr. Renzaho, you mentioned another garrison.  I believe it was the first that fell following what 
you -- you told us.  The first wave of the population that came into Kigali, I didn't hear that properly.  
A.	Counsel, it was -- it was the refugee camp, Nyacyonga, Rusiné. 
Q.	Yes, we heard that -- it's the name we didn't get.  How do you spell that name, sir?
A.	Nyacyonga, N-Y-A-C-Y-O-N-G-A.  
Q.	It is number 409 on our list.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, you see, the problem is not that name; that's well-known to all here.  The problem is the word following Nyacyonga.  What was that word? 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I mentioned "Rwamagana".  After the fall of Byumba, Rwamagana was affected, you know, with the fall of the eastern front and they were moving towards Kigali. 
MR. CANTIER:
It is number 489 on the list, Rwamagana.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's leave it at that.  That's fine, thank you.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, in your position as the guarantor of peace and security, under what circumstances would you requisition the gendarmerie or the army? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  In my position as the guarantor of peace and security, during the war from 
April to July 1994, it was very difficult for me, because the gendarmerie, which customarily intervenes in cases of maintenance of law and order, in cases of -- of crowds, or union activities was not available.  

The low numbers that remained were spread out to refugee reception sites.  But, I do recall that often when I actually requisitioned force, I was told that the gendarmerie units were also engaged in the frontline and that was the truth.  

And I may add that the gendarmerie brigades in the various neighbourhoods -- and those were the brigades that intervened to maintain order within the population generally -- received combat missions as the fighting moved to most of the neighbourhoods of the capital.  So, there were no gendarmes most of the time to intervene.  

Now, talking about the army, I believe a witness actually talked about this in this case.  I tried -- I turned everywhere.  I asked for help too from the army, you know, through informal contacts, but I knew that, according to the procedure, I did not have direct access to the army for purposes of law and order.  But it was the gendarmerie who, if overwhelmed by the situation, would have access to the army or to the ministry of national defence, which is the coordinator.  

But you understand that the situation did not give us respite to find a solution.  So I turned where I could and sometimes I did not receive anything on account of the situation.  Thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, can you briefly, but precisely, cite some examples where you obtained the assistance of the gendarmerie? 
A.	There are not many examples to cite.  I believe that, generally speaking, I obtained that refugee reception sites should be protected by an element of the gendarmerie.  And the gendarmerie staff's strength was very low admittedly, and that explained some of the excesses that happened sometimes, but I managed to obtain that.  
Q.	Sorry, can you cite some of the refugee reception sites? 
A.	Thank you.  These were Saint Paul, Sainte Famille, Hôtel des Mille Colline, the 
Lycée de Notre Dame de Citeaux, the Rwanga parish that was entrusted to a gendarmerie detachment from Nyamirambo, and other refugees were in the Saint Andre school -- and those are the sites I'm mentioning.  And other sites by the force of circumstances were, rather, evacuated:  Kiyovu, Celtar, and others, because the shelling was so much that the -- the -- the spreading out of the sites could not be managed.  
We couldn't do much to help them, so we moved them to Hôtel Mille Colline, and others went to (unintelligible) Sainte Famille.  But those are some of the main refugee reception sites in the area that was still under government control.  There were others in the areas controlled by the RPF, and I may cite some. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Remember to slow down when you are giving all these names.  You mentioned a school that I don't think we've heard of often in this trial.  Can you repeat that name and possibly spell it, if it's not on the spelling list, please? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, the school is Saint Andre; it is behind Charles Lwanga parish.  
MR. CANTIER:
Sorry, Mr. Renzaho, it's 510 on the list, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, and then there was an enumeration.  You mentioned Kiyovu, is that so? 
THE WITNESS:
Hotel Kiyovu, Mr. President. 
MR. CANTIER:
Number 256, Hotel Kiyovu.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And then there was another name after that one, can you help us, please? 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, it's Celtar, C-E-L-T-E-R (sic).  There were many people gathered there and they were evacuated.  
MR. CANTIER:
Number 76, I believe.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I believe there was also Charles Lwanga that was cited; it's 261.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, on the counterbalance, can you cite a number of examples where you requested for intervention and they were not answered positively? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Charity begins at home; I'll talk about the CELA incident.  Yesterday, I mentioned the circumstances in which I intervened at CELA.  I will not go back on them, but what is certain is that when I got the call from the gendarmes who were at CELA, I asked why they had not called for reinforcements from their superiors.  And they told me they had called Colonel Munyakazi who had not come.  So, I sought to -- to cross-check that information, and I asked my secretary to find out the Muhima gendarmerie and find Colonel Munyakazi.  That is what he did, and in the -- in the presence of members of the crisis committee in the secteur of the Kigali city, I spoke to Colonel Munyakazi.  

I put to him a problem that had cropped up at CELA, and called for his intervention as soon as possible.  And he replied that the -- the problem was not his concern, and that the situation -- the way it appeared was the business of the civilian authority.  And he said, "Maintenance of law and order was the business of the civilian authority".  

I answered, "Yes, that is true, but public force that can be used by the civilian authority in cases of excesses is the gendarmerie that you are.  So to defuse the crisis, the civilian authority has to be on the spot and you have to understand that public force is your element who are on the ground".  

So, I proposed to him that they should go there -- or, send somebody higher up of the hierarchy there to represent authority, or to -- to backstop the lieutenant who was there.  I also appointed officials from the commune to go to CELA and solve the incident.  That is what we agreed.  

So, there you have a case where I -- I went up to an official and it didn't work; it didn't turn out well.  Because later on, when I personally intervened, when I had asked him to go there because I was also going to be there, he did not come.  There are other cases, and I may cite the case of 
Simonga (sic), who went to evacuate refugees at Nyamirambo.  Because the situation was becoming untenable because of the fighting that was drawing near, and the convoy in which he was came up to the gendarmerie.  There was a roadblock manned by excited civilians; they stopped him.  Then he negotiated, saying that he was evacuating persons that had to be protected.  

Well, they didn't listen to him, and persons were brought down from the vehicle, taken to a primary school below Nyamirambo and were locked up there.  And the -- the gendarmerie looked on.  So, look at the -- witness.   I would have wanted that the authority should impose itself at the time of the crime and move away the vehicle with its passengers and take it to the area where Simonga wanted to take it; it didn't work.  There were other incidents that became habitual; I cannot cite them here, but the situation was serious. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And this last incident was about Mr. Aloys Simpunga, wasn't it?  Number 537 on the list, can you confirm that? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, the incident took place in Nyamirambo (inaudible)...  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Renzaho, now you have to listen:  Was this Mr. Simpunga you just referred to, yes or no? 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I sincerely apologise, I think I -- I didn't hear you well.  But I doubted whether you wanted clarifications -- or, I thought you wanted clarifications on the Nyamirambo incident, I'm sorry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So is the answer to my question "yes"?  

You see, the English interpreter gave a pronunciation of the person's name which is not Simpunga.  I need your confirmation that the person you referred to was Mr. Simpunga and not Mr. Simonga.  Now, will you please assist us so we can move on? 
THE WITNESS:
The name is Simpunga. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Now, the other issue:  You referred to a word called "Celtar" when we asked you to spell something a couple of minutes ago.  That is different from CELA, isn't it?  Now, what is Celtar?  That's what we got when you spelt it, can you help us, please? 
THE WITNESS:
You -- you want to know what Celtar means.  Well, it was a Protestant centre, more or less a cultural type of thing.  It did also pastoral activities, but received people who might want to organise conferences, marriages.  It was a centre to which people fled and where they sheltered. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Very good, thank you, remember to speak slowly.  

Here follows the next question.  
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, sometimes in spite of everyone's best efforts, there are difficulties in translation, and I myself wasn't following; I didn't know what it was exactly.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	So, Mr. Renzaho, now coming to resort to a public force, how -- after the 8th of April, the meeting you spoke of yesterday on the 8th in the morning -- how after the 8th of April 1994, did you exercise control over the police? 
A.	Well, it became very difficult.  You'll understand because the people -- the policemen left with the councillors, and the system -- the rotational system was no longer possible.  And where they were, they were sort of blocked.  Apart from the smaller detachment that stayed in préfecture, we didn't see them, and I was telling them we didn't have any means of communication -- the normal means of communication, sort of -- radios, we didn't have any means to communicate with the various offices in various places.  
Q.	Does that mean that after the 8th of April 1994 -- and, contrary to what had happened before, you could not muster the police force at the PVK? 
A.	Well, it was very difficult to muster the force at that time.  And some police officers assigned to councillors were practically served exclusively for -- as bodyguards for the councillors, rather than helping them to go out and get close to the citizenry.  That is the tendency I observed in the difficult circumstances; it is regrettable.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, did you participate in the negotiations that took place at the time after the 6th April -- that is, between the Rwandan armed forces and the RPF? 
A.	No, for the simple reason that I wasn't a soldier in service, and the delegation made up to negotiate with the RPF were soldiers or gendarme in service.  But, I think -- and I think I said so yesterday, when the crisis committee was established at the outset of hostilities on the 7th, it was, as you put forward the idea, of doing our utmost to bring the two parties together to negotiate a ceasefire, because the conflagration was such that to stop the killing -- to stop the disorder was not possible with the intensification of combat.  It was absolutely necessary to stop, and we proposed that a joint force of the APR and the RGF, the Rwandan government forces, under the auspices of the UNAMIR, might be put together and rapidly proceed to pacifying the country.  That was the proposal, but the negotiations were such that I did not take part in.  Thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, at this point, I should like to ask you if you are aware of a document authored by the ministry of defence, and summarising the situation of the Rwandan army officers?  Can you see, 
Mr. Renzaho? 
A.	Yes, yes, I know that document, which is a battle order drawn up by the ministry of defence.  Yes, I know it.  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, Your Honours, it is volume 1, tab 33 I am referring to.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you want Mr. Renzaho to have it in front of him? 
MR. CANTIER:
No, no, he knows the document.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, so this document, dated the 5th of March 1994, on what basis are -- are you in the document?  If you don't remember, I'll tell you? 
A.	Well, if it's the battle order drawn up by the ministry of defence, I'm there, in as much as the document lists all the officers, and identifies -- indicates their position, their post at the time -- at the time the document was prepared.  
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, Your Honours, it is the battle order.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	And, indeed, you are here in this list as an officer put at the disposal of the MINADEF, the ministry of defence; do you remember that? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, I remember that.  
Q.	Therefore, Mr. Renzaho, I will go back with the following question in our attempt to make it clear to the Trial Chamber what was your role at the time of the events:  What were your relations with the government? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you answer that question, Mr. Renzaho, could you indicate to us, Maître Cantier, which page we should look at in MINADEF-2 in order to find Mr. Renzaho, just so that the Bench has identified the relevant portion? 
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, it's the first two pages that are the most important, because they give the names of the highest-ranking officers, as well as the other ranks and their functions.  So, on page 2, you see, concerning Mr. Renzaho, that he was mis à la disposition", at the dis -- put at the disposal.  So he's got no military function as such. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And now the answer, Mr. Renzaho, do you remember the question? 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, yes -- well, I'd like him to repeat the question, actually, in point of fact, yes.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Your relations with the government at that time? 
A.	My relations with the government were very, very sketchy.  So that means to say they were very difficult.  You know that on the 12th of April 1994, unexpectedly, the government left.  Very few people were informed that it was moving -- including me, meaning, including me, I was not informed.  And I was obliged to hit the road to Gitarama every -- which I couldn't do -- everyday.  And so, on a few occasions, I did indeed go to Gitarama.  

I saw people, but the difficult thing was that I couldn't do it all the time.  Even the telephone link wasn't established, so there were difficulties.  The place they went to had absolutely no command infrastructure, and it was complete isolation in respect of the situation in the interior.  So, it was completely isolated from the exterior. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was there no telephone connection between Kigali and Gitarama from the 12th of April throughout the period the government was in Gitarama? 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I can't actually confirm that, I never tried; I never used it.  But -- except a colleague, and that was when we were in exile, told me that a friendly country -- to try and help, had supplied a satellite telephone to some authorities to be able to communicate --  I don't know.  So, you see, I really -- I don't know.  As far as I'm concerned, I was given no telephone from Kigali -- from Gitarama to Kigali.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	So, Mr. Renzaho, you told us that your government -- your minister had not informed you of their departure? 
A.	Yes, that's what I'm telling you and it's true.  When I learned that the government had left or was leaving, I saw the last ones to leave.  About 11:30, when I said goodbye to my family, somebody said to me, "Do you know that the government is moving?"  I said, "No, I know nothing about that".  And so I went to the Hôtel des Diplomates and I saw the last one loading their suitcases in the cars, and leaving.  It's as though there was an immediate threat.  I couldn't understand; I -- I didn't understand a thing.  
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Renzaho, might I ask you, when you -- when you were left as the last representative of the state in Kigali, what did you think of it?  What -- 
A.	Well, first of all, let me tell you, I wasn't the only representative of the government because there were forces over which I had no authority, and I think Kigali's particular status is not comparable to the usual situation in other préfectures.  

It's true by affiliation, I was -- I was a representative of the ministry of the interior -- of the government.  But there was the army, there was the gendarmerie.  Those are entities -- autonomous entities over which I did not have any authority, and further -- 
Q.	What did you think of it?  How did you see it?  What was your appreciation of the situation and, in particular, with regard to yourself? 
A.	Well, let me tell you that it was -- personally, it was very hard to bear.  It was a blow, a very, very hard blow.  Maybe my heart is not as others is - but, I felt it personally as a great blow.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, can you tell us how the population saw this departure of the government three days after it was instituted? 
A.	Counsel, let me tell you it was a -- it was a clear sign of the distress in which the Rwandan population found itself.  And, I think, in general terms, the citizenry felt that the Rwandan state no longer existed, and we experienced situations where the citizens showed us that we had no legitimacy.  I can't describe the scenes in which I personally participated where I was treated as a bandit by people I didn't know.  It was -- it was the complete déchéance of the Rwandan state.  
Q.	Coming back to you, yourself, at that time, what were the departments and the -- who were the main people working with you? 
A.	The main department heads who worked with me were (inaudible)...Butera who was responsible for administration and legal affairs.  There was Simpunga, Aloys, Aloysius, Aloys who was in charge of social affairs; and there was Nyamuhimba, who was in charge of the police force.  There was 
Silvestre Munyakazi; there was also Munyanziza, Félicien in charge of accounting and his assistant -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, I didn't get the name.  
THE WITNESS:
Dieudonné -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Dieudonné" something.  
THE WITNESS:
(Unintelligible)...and others who responded to my call, but many others could not get to the préfecture.  

If you want to tell me who else was close to me, there was the secretary who typed out all the correspondence at the time, Astérie.  And there was Alfred, who was there for a while but left.  And then there was the bourgmestre, Nyirinkwaya, Pierre Claver, who'd sought refuge at a préfecture.  And then after the 12th, Bourgmestre Bizimana, yes -- no, yes, he did.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's break this up, shall we look at the names?  We need Silvestre, and after Silvestre, there was an accountant, was that so?  Just mention those two names.  

Can you help us, Maître Cantier?  
MR. CANTIER:
Well, the first name Butera, Jean-Baptiste, number 66.
MR. PRESIDENT.
I'm now trying to identify the names we have problems with, not the easy ones.  So the accountant, what was that name, please? 
MR. CANTIER:
That's Félicien Munyanziza, number 327. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And he assisted, was it Dieudonné Nkurikiyinka, number 378, was that the testimony?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that's what I said.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And then there was the name of a bourgmestre.  We need Pierre Claver's last name.  Can you help us, which number is that again? 
THE WITNESS:
Nyirinkwaya. N-Y-I-R-I-N-K-W-A-Y-A.
MR. CANTIER:
Number 427 on the list, Mr. President, number 427.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
You mean 428? 
MR. CANTIER:
Quite, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, can you indicate the activities -- what were your daily activities at that time?  What subjects could you deal with at the time? 
A.	Well, I can't totally recall.  Our activities -- in distress, everything comes up at the same time.  I think we had to face the problem of movement.  The people who wanted to flee from the fighting -- to flee from the town.  We also had the problem of welcoming -- of receiving refugees at various sites.  We had problems of public safety because we had to intervene here and there to help the people who called us for assistance calling for help.  And we had to intervene when we were informed when information -- there was information that there was an imminent threat, we would try to intervene.  

So, there were problems of water, of provisions, food supplies.  The town was cut off; we had to find food supplies.  There was a problem of sanitation because the -- the workers were -- couldn't move from where they were.  We had to work with the CHK and the Red Cross to get the hospital working and the few health centres still in existence.  We had to try, also at one point to mobilise the pharmacists who had stocked supplies in their pharmacies to take them to the hospital -- to supply the hospital.  I can't itemise all the problems because they were endless, innumerable, and attempts at solutions had to be found.  I cannot give you an exhaustive list.  Thank you very much.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, to cope with all these problems, were you at the préfecture all day long?  Did you stay up till evening?  Can you tell us how much time you devoted to that piece of work?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Time did not count any longer for me.  Effectively, I devoted the bulk of my time to the préfecture because there were things to organise -- interventions to be carried out, decisions to be taken, and for most of the time, I stayed at the préfecture for most of that period.  

And as I have said, we did not have resources that we had in times of peace.  In fact, most of the workers did not come.  There were very few of us, and we had to organise ourselves to do the minimum as much as we could.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, can you tell us if the assistance to the population that you just mentioned, while providing such assistance, did you give preference to any particular group?  And in that connection, could you also talk about the issuing of laissez-passers? 
A.	Counsel, I didn't give preference to any particular group.  Any person who was in difficulty, who sought any service whatsoever in our préfecture, was received.  With respect to the issuing of documents, we gave a positive reply to all requests.  We were not selective in the issuing of such documents -- well, maybe something has happened elsewhere without my knowledge.  But, personally, I set up a service in front of the main entrance of the building and assigned some of the refugees who were in there to help the others, and to do so quickly because I was always thinking of the possibility of shelling.  That would not take long, and that was a small window that we had to -- to deal with the numerous crowds that came for those documents.  And then, later on, we started having heavy shelling.  But we made no distinction of the persons who came to ask us for those documents.  Thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, you knew that some people claimed that the laissez-passer system was set up to prevent persons of Tutsi origin from escaping from the capital.  What is your answer to that? 
A.	Counsel, I'll reply that in crisis situations like that one, the delivery of documents to persons moving from one préfecture to the other was -- was the usual practice.  It was not invented between April and July 1994.  We had that system from the beginning of the war, since 1990.  And when the Arusha negotiations started in July 1992, following the ceasefire accord that we had signed with the RPF, the government of Dr. Nsengiyaremye took that measure.  And since everybody believed in peace, the measures were taken to stimulate the economy and help the movement of persons.  

So, the laissez-passer document have -- had always existed.  In fact, I knew them in the first republic too, when the situation was even worse.  Because the laissez-passers were a fixture:  You could not move from one commune to another one without a laissez-passer.  It was the second republic that abolished that measure.  

So, the laissez-passers in times of crisis have always existed in Rwanda; it was not an invention.  It was a protective measure in that time of suspicion, brutal attacks on persons without any kind of verification.  Someone who had a laissez-passer was supposed to have met with officials who had granted them permission to enter, but it was not directed against the Tutsis, because Tutsis came and I served them.  

I may tell you that the last of those persons who received a laissez-passer was the former chairman of the state council.  I knew him, but I didn't know his family.  He came at the end of the month of April, and the hoard of persons had moved out.  We served him and we found an escort for him, and then he was escorted to the (unintelligible)...camp, it was Kibuye.  And other persons helped from that point to move him -- it was Bukavu from Kibuye.  Because the roads were closed off, so we made no distinction between people.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, can you give us the name of that person, please? 
A.	I don't recall his name, but I know that he was the chairman of the state council.  But, frankly, I tried to -- to remember him, but I can't bring his name up.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which ethnicity did he have? 
THE WITNESS:
He was Tutsi and his family, too, I think.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, did the préfecture give out fuel coupons? 
A.	Thank you for your question, Counsel.  I found that charge in my indictment.  The préfecture did not have stocks of fuel to share out.  In the early days, Kigali lost that part of town where stocks of fuel was stored.  Gatsata was already occupied and that was where fuel was stocked, and the others were far away in Kibuye.  
Q.	Sorry, I should interrupt there.  The Chamber has understood that the PVK was not a fuel station.  But I asked a question on fuel coupons -- fuel coupons.  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  
A.	Well, they are related -- how can I give fuel coupons when I don't have fuel stocks.  Yes, there were fuel coupons for vehicles of the préfecture, and those vehicles were identified and numbered, and we went to fetch fuel in the army stores of fuel.  There was a commission managed by the army; that commission managed and gave out fuel.  That is why I didn't want to say that we -- we shared out petrol coupons when we didn't have stores of fuel.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Renzaho, in many countries when there is an emergency, there is a system because there is a lack of certain commodities.  There is a system that, for instance, civilian authorities may decide who shall get this or that.  Now, was there such a system? 

With other words, was your system involved in the decision-making process to decide who should receive fuel coupons, and then, on the basis of receiving such coupons, they could go somewhere else and get the fuel?  Was there such a system?  Was your office involved in that?  That is the question.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President, I'll answer your question.  

Our office was never involved in any organisation to manage the country's logistical situation as far as fuel was concerned -- like, managing fuel and authorising people to take certain quotas.  

I don't even know whether quotas were set, but all what was left in terms of stocks -- that is, filling stations in the city that still had fuel -- were taken over by the army.  And to have a bit of fuel by a man who was in charge of the logistics commission -- because we had a logistics commission set up for some other purpose to supply the city of Kigali, and so my man went to meet the persons who managed that stock of fuel so as to service the vehicles of the préfecture.  
That is what I know.  But, we did not know any distribution system or quotas for a category of people.  I did not know of any kind of system like that to which the préfecture was involved.  Thank you.

1015H
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Renzaho, I'll continue, and I will ask you the following question:  The persons come and seek refuge at the PVK.  You have discussed this issue, but in an indirect way; if these people came, how many people were there? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, as from the 7th people came to seek refuge at the Kigali city préfecture.  Some of them did not stay on a permanent basis at the préfecture.  Some of them wanted to go elsewhere; for instance, Hôtel des Mille Collines; and some asked me to help move them to join their families in the centre of the country, for instance, Kabgayi; and others stayed on in the préfecture.  And apart from the incident I mentioned, which fortunately did not lead to any casualties among the refugees, some of them were transferred to the Hôtel des Mille Collines; others went to the Notre Dame de Citeaux while waiting for the exchange of refugees, for those who wanted as part of such exchange to move elsewhere.  Others stayed with me until 3 July.  

And I want to explain to the Chamber, on 25 June I went to Gisenyi for a very urgent mission where I held discussions and I was held back by some other problems.  But the negative situation that was unfolding in Kigali prompted me to want to come back because I was concerned that the refugees that had been left at the préfecture could face problems, and I would not know what to do because we had taken in these people and something could happen in my absence.  

So I did everything.  I came across columns of refugees that were leaving -- and then I came back three days after and we managed to control Kigali.  I had the opportunity to take them to 
Hôtel des Mille Collines and then the others I took to the Lycée la Notre Dame de Citeaux.  Then I was through with these people, and then we left Kigali. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, at that time where was your family? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I think my family -- I don't know at what precise moment you are talking about.  Are you talking about June?  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, we are talking about this trip that you made, and you mentioned end of June I believe? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And then you explained that you came back at that time because you were concerned about the refugees.  So I was asking you where was your family at that same time, were they in Kigali, Gitarama, as we mentioned before, or elsewhere? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel, at that time in June my family was in Cyangugu. 
Q.	Thank you for that clarification.  Mr. Renzaho, what was the ethnic origin of those refugees? 
A.	Counsel, their ethnicity includes Hutu and Tutsis.  I don't know if there was Batwas amongst them.  At some point I even received foreigners of European origin and mostly foreigners of African origin, who did not stay at the préfecture.  But for Rwandans there were Hutus and Tutsis in the majority and they came from all over, but the majority from the centre and south of the country. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, could you give us a figure for those refugees because we understand that some stayed only for a while and some wanted you to send them to the other side; but can you give us the variation approximately, a figure, please? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  We kept about 150 persons at the préfecture.  They were in the conference hall of the préfecture.  And in addition to the workers that were there, they were in the main hall of the building and they also occupied some offices. 
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Renzaho, how do you explain the fact that people came to seek refuge at the préfecture, whereas parts of members of the state machinery were participating in the massacres, directly or indirectly? 
A.	Counsel, we were living in a period of distress and the population sought to protect themselves as best as they could and people came to seek refuge at the préfecture.  Now regarding your assertion that the massacres were perpetrated by part of the state, people belonging to the state machinery, I don't know.  Well, talking about animal diseases, we don't know the first animal that caught the disease.  

And all what I have been trying to demonstrate here, showing the convergence of the various populations that came into Kigali, it's not an illusion, it was real.  And I would like to acknowledge, frankly, that talking about the state machinery, I was part of it.  And since I am in front of this Honourable Chamber, it is my duty to say whether I received an order somewhere to kill or not, since we are talking about the state machinery, and my answer is:  No.  

In my humble opinion, when some civil servants over whom I had some authority, have come here, I have not seen one of them who stated that I gave him an order to kill.  So members of the state machinery who killed -- it is true soldiers could have belonged to a particular unit, but was it the unit commander who asked the soldier to go and kill?  So, we don't have the evidence thereof.  Gendarmes who did the same thing, we don't have any evidence.  Some other civil servants was involved in the tragedy of Rwanda.  Where did they get their orders from?  I don't know.  

I merely observe the view, with your leave, that the government of Dismas Nsengiyaremye could not, in my humble opinion, ferment a plan that would lead to the extermination of the Tutsis because within that group there were many staff who were faithful to the RPF. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, we could come back on this in other questions.  But the question on which I wanted you to react was:  How do you explain that people come to seek refuge in a structure that could be deadly to them following what is being said today?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before you answer, you just referred to this government of Dismas Nsengiyaremye, number 390, is that not so, Mr. Renzaho?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much, and now the answer please. 
THE WITNESS:
I acknowledge that people came to seek refuge at the préfecture.  Among those peoples there were my own civil servants, because, to speak the truth, I was there.  There were also refugees at the préfecture.  And there were people, foreigners, who came to seek refuge at the préfecture.  I believe they were looking for protection, and the basic motivation was the quest for protection.  And I don't have any doubt that if these people were convinced that we were dangerous, that we were criminals and could kill them, they would not have come.  Because they were running away from the danger and they would not have come to our préfecture in the face of the same danger.  Thank you. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, you've told us that most of the time you were at the PVK, and it was at the PVK that you carried out most of your activities; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I was in my office where I spent most of my time, because I expected problems through the crisis committee, so as to intervene on any issue with regard to some of the activities that were to be carried on behalf of the population.  So I made myself available to be able to do something and help them. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, where was your office located? 
A.	My office was on the second floor of the building of the Kigali city préfecture, precisely -- the windows of my office were in the front façade of the building.  And for persons who know Kigali, it was opposite the SORAS building.  And when you are coming from the army side, opposite the Saint Michel Cathedral. 
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Renzaho, did you stay in your office until the end of your stay in Kigali and the PVK? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The building you just referred to, there was an abbreviation there; can you spell it, please?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, it is number 541 on the list, S-O-R-A-S. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you and now the answer, Mr. Renzaho.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I did not stay in my office after 25 April 1994, on account of the shelling of the building of the Kigali city préfecture.  In fact I narrowly escaped a rocket attack that missed the window and fell on the wall at the side of the window, and fell and then exploded in the main garden.  

So I went down to the ground floor and took a small office and stayed there for the rest of the time that I spent at the Kigali city préfecture.  It was a small office -- I mean everybody saw that small office.  Thank you. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, in your usual office, what means of communication did you have? 
A.	Thank you.  In my old office I had two telephones.  One was an intercom system.  When I wanted any servant, I could telephone directly.  Then there was a telephone with an external line. 
Q.	Did you enjoy the same facilities in the office in which you moved later on in the ground floor? 
A.	I did not.  In that small office I found an intercom set, just like every office of the préfecture had.  And that is what I used and I went through the front desk. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
When there was this shelling, around the 25th of April that resulted in your leaving the old office, was the office itself damaged in any way?  I heard you tell us that the shells landed in the garden. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  There was quite severe damage.  The main entrance, for example, all the windows were blown out and a higher floor near -- on the Rwandan TV side was destroyed, as well as the perimeter wall was destroyed.  I suppose we were lucky in a way that we could go on working there, but it had been shelled several times. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the telephone connections in that office, were they affected by the shelling?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I know that the phones -- phone numbers beginning with 7 were working, although intermittently there were some problems.  An attempt was made to repair it, because I had mobilised some technical staff to remedy that type of thing.  So, numbers with the prefix 7 functioned. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:	
	I think my microphone was off.  Question from counsel? 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.       Mr. Renzaho, did you have an autonomous means of communication, such as a Motorola?  
A.       May I answer that question?  
Q.	Yes.  It was a mere technical incident, Mr. Renzaho.  
A.	Yes, I wanted to say that I did not have at any time.  As of the day I was appointed préfet of Kigali, we did not have Motorolas at the préfecture, thank you. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, let's come back to your activities during the events.  Can you tell us -- we will come back to that later -- of cases where you personally intervened on the ground? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  The thing that springs immediately to mind is what I've already spoken of, on the 22nd of April at the CELA -- I don't need to repeat the circumstances under which I intervened.  But, secondly, the incident -- perhaps not an incident as such, but a problem that required me to go there.  I don't like to speak of it too much.  But at the Nyirurema health centre.  I don't want to dwell on it.  There were people who had to be evacuated, important people who were in danger.  There were orphans and the responsable was asking for means of transport, water, I provided him with that, and the matter seems to have been settled.  I heard no complaints afterwards.  

And another incident in which I participated was quite fortuitous because I did not expect anything.  I was on the way to Gitarama where I took Mr. Gamanyi to see his family.  I left him at Kabgayi.  And being there, I thought -- well, I said to myself, well, I might accomplish several things and go and see a few family members who were at Byimana, near the parish.  

And there was in fact my wife's aunt, and there I saw people who were under threat and who wanted to leave that place and go to seek refuge at Kabgayi.  They told me of their problem and I said, well, look, I'm here.  If I can do something.  Try and get yourselves organised quickly, I don't have much time, and I'll take you to Kabgayi archbishopric.  And that's what I did.  It was by chance.  I was only there to see what the situation was.  

And another situation in which I participated was that of Kanogo.  As I told you of the circumstances, I don't need to repeat it at this stage because I spoke of it yesterday.  I intervened and I was able to settle the matter with the help of other people.  But I tried to explain to the Trial Chamber how difficult was the psychology -- the psychology of the people.  It was evidently difficult to work with people that one did not know.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We heard of Kanogo, number 216, yesterday.  But we need help with the health centre; is that number 419, Maitre Cantier?  Or what was the name?  
MR. CANTIER: 
I am sorry, Mr. President.  I didn't grasp the name.  I don't recall.  Perhaps Mr. Renzaho can help us?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it was near Nyiranuma, N-Y-I-R-A-N-U-M-A, Nyiranuma.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Then the name of the persons who were threatened, the second episode, was it Bizimana, or was it a different name?  
THE WITNESS:
I think I was speaking of Byimana, B-Y-I-M-A-N-A, Byimana.  It's a place in Gitarama préfecture. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, we have that one, Mr. President.  It is number 68, 68, Byimana. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Renzaho, thank you for those illustrations.  

I should like now to come back to the CELA, because you have been mentioned in that context, without making too much heavy weather of it, I'd like you to go through the events, especially the beginning because you did mention it yesterday.  When you received the -- when you were alerted, you asked -- what did you ask the bourgmestre that he did not do?  You've already told us. 

So, Mr. Renzaho, on those events, my question in the instance is with whom did you go there and at what time? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I went with my driver, two policemen who were escorting me, and I went in my Renault 21.  I don't know which policemen were supposed to come with me, so I started off.  But I heard later on other policemen followed me.  

So I left with those people and I arrived at the CELA through the small entrance, a small track that in fact runs along the northern side.  It's difficult to explain, but I think a sketch was used, the higher part, the upper ground of the buildings where there was a small gate allowing access to the internal courtyard which was -- it was overlooked by a mound with a few bushes on top and a few banana trees within an enclosure that was below the OAU Boulevard, which ran from the roundabout to Gikondo and Kanombe.  So, there was about 40 people -- 
Q.	I'm sorry, Mr. Renzaho, at what time I'd asked you.  
A.	Yes, thank you, Counsel.  The time at which I arrived was about 9 o'clock, around 9 o'clock. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel's microphone is not on. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	So you arrived at about 9 o'clock and what was the situation you found there that confronted you? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  The situation in which I found myself?  Well, opposite -- I was faced with an aggression by a group of people who'd entered the plot and who were on that small hill I'd mentioned.  They had machetes.  They had kuku grass cutters and some of them even had rifles.  And when I arrived they were cutting the grass and cleaning around the banana trees that were in that part of the plot.  And in the middle there was some gendarme on the side walk, along which -- that I took to get into the plot.  And lower down were the refugees, I saw some.  

When I arrived the gendarme came to greet me and we spoke for a few minutes.  I asked them what was the situation?  What was the problem?  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but it is for clarification:  How many gendarmes were there when you arrived? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I found about seven or eight gendarmes.  I did not count them exactly, but there were seven or eight.  And among them I saw a lieutenant, an officer, Kamana, Lieutenant Kamana.  And also saw a sergeant major that I knew.  He's from my home area and we're even vaguely related; he is the godfather of one of my children.  Mugiraneza, Wellars, Sergeant Major Wellars Mugiraneza.
Q.	Just a moment, Mr. Renzaho.  We want to get these names down pat.  Right, Mr. Renzaho.  Can you spell the name of the lieutenant you mentioned?  Was it Kamana? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Isn't that number 204?  
MR. CANTIER: 
519, 519 is Sekamana. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, we didn't get that number. 
MR. CANTIER: 
And he was a sergeant major. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please repeat the second number. 
MR. CANTIER: 
297, Mr. President, 297. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the first name was Sekamana; that was the evidence, was is it, Mr. Renzaho?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct, Mr. President. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	I had interrupted you, Mr. Renzaho.  So, you arrived at the CELA and you told us that you met Lieutenant Sekamana, about six or seven gendarmes, the Sergeant Major Mugiraneza, Wellars.  Please go on with your narrative.  As of then, who were you talking with? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  After having received information as to the situation, the problem that had to be settled -- the matter to be settled was we had to approach the group of attackers and try to understand why they were attacking, what they were after, why they had come there.  

So, I went up to them.  I went up the little hillock or mound and tried to start dialogue with them, but the gang were worked up to such an extent they didn't want to listen to me.  I introduced them -- myself.  I told them I was the préfet of Kigali town.  And it was my duty to intervene and ask why these people had come to make trouble in the plot and for the people there and create a disturbance there.  

I asked them to come down from the mound or hillock and to make a semi-circle in front of me on the track by which I'd entered the plot which was still on the top side of the plot.  They protested.  They proffered insults, but I was firm, insistent.  But the few gendarmes there could not resist those people, the 40 of them or so.  And in such circumstances it's better not to disturb the beehive.  And seeing that I was firm, they began to calm down.  But really unwillingly.  

I asked them to hurry up because I had other things to do, and finally they did.  They came down to the bottom, to the track at the bottom of the mound or hill.  And I asked them to lineup in a semi-circle, which they did but with a very bad face.  And I asked the gendarme present to surround them.  They had arms.  They were armed.  I asked them to put their arms down, to put all that material down.  

Now the problem was to identify the leader and try and start a dialogue with those people.  I asked:  Who is your leader?  And they all started shouting at me insults.  And to a point where I said to myself, well, these people are putting me in a tight spot, maybe they don't want me to succeed.  And I told them, "You are going to listen to me.  I've got no problem with you except that you're breaking the law and I am doing my duty.  Tell me who is your leader, or who can answer for you.  I am coming up here to do my job and I'll be a normal citizen, but let him do it in public."  

That's where I saw one person emerge and asked the others in the group to keep quiet and listen to the préfet. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I am sorry, at this point did you know the person who emerged the group, step forward?  Do we have his name? 
A.	Absolutely not, I didn't know him.  You can't ask me who he was.  It was the first time in my life I saw him. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, by your side, or in the group of attackers, was there a conseiller, either masculine or feminine? Were there people that you knew that were present, either behind or facing you with the assailants? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I say here in the presence of the Trial Chamber I saw no conseiller, the people mentioned in the indictment were not present at that place.  I did not see Munyeshyaka.  And I wonder even how I could've seen him under the circumstances in which I intervened.  And I did not see 
	Odette Nyirabagenzi, a conseiller from the Rugenge secteur, because the intervention took place without her having reported that was an incident.  I did not see her on the spot.  Nor did I see Mukandituye, to save time.  Maybe if I had found someone who was an authority, who was known, the matter might have been solved more rapidly.  But I saw no one with whom -- I saw no one who could be an interlocutor.  

May I continue? 
Q.	Later, Mr. Renzaho.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we will continue at 11:30.  

The court is adjourned.  
(Court recessed from 1103H to 1132H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Maitre Cantier?  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, we were talking about the (unintelligible).  And you were explaining to the Chamber the discussion that you managed to establish with a person you're unable to identify and who apparently spoke on behalf of the assailants.  Then I asked you whether you could recall the name of that person and whether the group was accompanied by other persons.  

Mr. Renzaho, at this stage of your narration did the bourgmestre come to where you were? 
A.	I learnt that he came, but my concern was focussed on what I had to do.  Because the issue of the assailants had to be addressed and I was focussed on that. 
Q.	What was the outcome of the discussion that you managed to establish with the "leader" of the assailants? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I took the person who came up and presented himself as the leader of the group.  I asked him to take -- to choose three other persons from the group, and we went slightly apart to some place that looked like a garage.  And there the gendarme, the non-commissioned officer who was there, I initiated discussion with the people who were there and I asked them, "What is the purpose of your presence here?  What is your problem?"  

Then they told me incidents that happened at CELA that had cost the life of two or three persons.  In fact, the person who caused the last straw that led to the incident was killed the day before and the person left the commission centre towards Rugenge going through the area where there was the tollgate roadblock at the time.  "So with these three persons killed, do you think it was the CELA community that did it?  That is, infiltrated persons who came in and shot at passengers or passersby.  Why did you not go and see gendarmes?  Because there were gendarmes at the Sainte Famille."  And then they replied, "No, we came to see the people who were hiding in this place.  And the site was not identified.  We could not see people here, that is, security officials.  So we wanted to know what was happening."  

In short, I cannot narrate all the discussion that we had at that point, so I was able to ascertain that these people were coming under the pretext that people had been killed at CELA.  Whether such persons were killed, it's possible because we had killers hiding all over.  They burst into homes and killed people.  That was true.  But was it also true for that particular situation?  I don't know.  
And these persons were asking that CELA should be controlled with persons assigned to it on a permanent basis, or that the persons be moved to another site where there were more refugees and under greater control. 
Q.	Sorry, Mr. Renzaho, at that point, and for better understanding, did it mean that gendarmerie officers were not stationed on a permanent basis at CELA?  Because I don't really understand what you mentioned, the gendarmes that you found there when you arrived.  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  I think it is true that gendarmes sent patrols there, but they were not there on a permanent basis.  I talked it over with the gendarmes who were there and it was true that gendarmes were not assigned there on a permanent basis.  

And the difficulty of finding personnel to assign at that centre on a permanent basis prompted me to opt for the other solution; that is, I asked the refugees to be moved to Saint Paul and Sainte Famille.  The gendarmes were saying that they were in small numbers and they could not split themselves into two.  And I saw it was true, myself, because those who were there were really very few.  

So I told the other side, "This is what we are going to agree upon, you have done your job by reporting the problem to security officials.  I am the representative of such officials.  I will take charge of the situation and in this case your duties as citizens is over, so you'll oblige me by leaving this place and going home because your mission is over.  We will take charge of the situation.  I promise you, we'll move these persons to the Saint Paul and Sainte Famille centre."  

So we agreed on that decision and I asked the representative to go, and I left with him and the gendarmes who were there to see the group that was still stationed where we left them.  We relayed the information to them and it was their representative who told them about the decision that was taken.  He took them aside and told them.  Some of them demonstrated.  Others just hung their heads, maybe as a sign of consent.  So I took the opportunity to tell the group that, "We were responsible for the measures that we had taken and we had taken those measures in consultation with you.  You had done the right thing by coming to report the situation." 
MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, I think power is restored. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, in the scene that was unfolding, did you speak to the refugees, or one or more representatives of the refugees, to explain to them the decision that you had thought out or you had agreed upon with the representatives of the assailants? 
A.	Counsel, first, I had to make the group to go away, that is what I just said.  So I dismissed the group.  Some left abusing me, but they actually left.  

And when they left, I went back to inform -- to extend the message that the refugees had to be moved to Saint Paul and Sainte Famille.  I was with the gendarmes staying near the garage.  I invited some of the refugees, because I did not wait for everybody to be present.  And I did not even know the exact number of refugees that were there.  

So they came and I asked Lakisana to communicate the measure to them.  And I simply said that the first group had to leave in my presence and that the gendarmes were going to escort these people to Saint Paul.  And that is what was done.  

And when the first group left, contrary to what the witness came here and said, these people did not pass through the tiny streets on which I had positioned people to get out on the third street to go to Sainte Famille.  But they took the short cut, which moved from Saint Paul and follows a small corridor without actually moving on to the highway.  The first group left before my own eyes. 
Q.	Sorry, Mr. Renzaho, I have to ask you a question at this point.  That first wave of departures, when did it happen and what did you do? 
A.	That departure took place at about 11 o'clock and I immediately considered that my work there was over and I took the vehicle and went back to the préfecture. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, at what time did you leave CELA? 
A.	I left CELA at the time when the first group starting leaving, at about 11 o'clock.  It was at about 
	11 o'clock that I left CELA, and that is correct.  And I -- let me add, that I was at the préfecture and the gendarmes came and informed me -- neither the gendarme or anybody came to inform me that there was an incident later on.  I learnt of it from accusations which came up later to which I reacted.  The time is long past, but I learnt of it from external sources.  That is the motivation of the incidents.  I was not dreaming.  I believe I was there and that is what I did.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So you were there that morning for two hours from 9 to 11; have I understood it correctly?  
THE WITNESS:
That is correct, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, at CELA did you meet persons belonging to the family of Rwanga? 
A.	I did not even know the Rwanga family, and I only read about them in the statement that was given to me by the Prosecution.  I did not know the family.  Thank you. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, did you know a person called Emmanuel Gihana, G-I-H-A-N-A? 
A.	Counsel, I did not know that person, and to date I do not know him.  And during my brief stop at CELA I've told you what I did.  I did not speak to any refugee individually, separately.  I only communicated to them the decision we had taken and I left.  Thank you. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, did you know a person called Vincent Mugiraneza, M-U-G-I-R-A-N-E-Z-A, Mugiraneza? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I knew that person.  And Mr. Vincent Mugiraneza was an older person in the secondary school I attended.  So since we were in the same region we used to take the same itinerary until he moved school because he did not continue with me.  But I knew him much later when he took up a diplomatic post.  So I knew that person.  On several occasions I went to the ministry of foreign affairs where he worked and I knew him. 
Q.	Did you meet him at CELA? 
A.	Counsel, maybe I will bore people by repeating I did not see that person, just as I did not see members of the Rwanga family, and I learnt of their existence only here.  Thank you. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, let us move to the issue of the distribution of arms.  Did you distribute or have arms distributed as at 6th April 1994? 
A.	Counsel, I did not distribute or have any weapons distributed.  I did not have any stock of arms at the préfecture. 
Q.	Did you invite members of the commune administration to go and look for arms elsewhere? 
A.	I would like to recall to the Honourable Chamber that I had a police service.  All security issues including issues related to arms, I could have used my police service to look for arms.  And if such arms had to be distributed, then the police had to be in charge.  So to answer your question, I would say no. 
Q.	So, Mr. Renzaho, how do you explain the proliferation of arms in the city of Kigali, and the charges that were brought against you on this issue on the distribution of arms? 
A.	Counsel, I thank you for that question.  And maybe it is time to address this issue on which most of the allegations concentrated.  The proliferation of weapons is seen in every country at war.  All countries at war experience a situation, and Rwanda was no exception.  

Under the circumstances that I described yesterday in which a country that had lived in peace, a pacifists' country, maybe the word is too strong, and which was suddenly exposed to a wave of aggression, whose military staff strength was 6,000 men, how could such a country cope with the situation?  So it was obliged to undertake massive recruitment.  And by the end of 1991 and early 1992 that staff strength moved to around about 25,000 men to cope with the various frontlines.  So you understand that the system that you had for recruitment, training, could no longer be respected.  And the consequence was immediate: a lack of quality for the trained soldiers.  That is what I said yesterday and I don't want to repeat it.  

And the outcome of that situation was a near spontaneous proliferation of weapons.  Soldiers deserted the frontline.  Some criminals, who were recruited without following the regular procedure, used the opportunity to have access to arms.  So there were arms coming from soldiers who were disseminating them in the population.  I would also like to cite another source of arms.  Well, before 6 April 1994, and probably before 1st October 1990, weapons had been brought into the country illegally through the clandestine networks of the RPF.  

And I would like to point to the evidence of a book published by Mr. Valens Kajeguhakwa that highlighted only one aspect.  And that book was titled, Rwanda: A Land of Peace to a Land of Blood, and What After?  In several excerpts you would realise there were networks that brought in weapons into the country, and he was one of the persons who created RPF networks in the country before the attack of 1 October 1990.  So, in that way arms were brought into the country.  

So I will continue now with the situation that we faced with the installation of the third battalion of the RPF and the CND.  One has to be blind to refuse to see the reality, not to see the situation as we experienced it in Kigali.  These persons received supplies of arms and men from their base in Uganda and the entry was free because those weapons entered the headquarters of the RPF in Mulindi.  And through timber transportation vehicles, those arms got into Kigali.  And maybe not to take too much time I will say that the weapons proliferation situation in Kigali was already a cause of concern way back in January 1994.  

In many reports of UNAMIR the issue of the proliferation of arms in Kigali is mentioned.  And this issue was raised at a meeting that I mentioned at the Kigali city préfecture, a meeting that took place in February 1994.  The préfecture authorities had asked that they be able to participate and contribute to the protection of illegal arms and they asked for greater collaboration with UNAMIR.  I am not making this up.  There was the chief of staff of the army and the gendarmerie.  And the issue of proliferation of arms was on the agenda.  Unfortunately, the framework for collaboration was not established.  But I must point out here the goodwill of all the persons involved to participate in the action to clean up the security situation in Kigali. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, at that time were there soldiers or gendarmes who had left the army or the gendarmerie?  Were there deserters? 
A.	Are you talking about the situation before 6 April 1994?  
Q.	No, I am talking about the period of interest to us, because we're talking about weapons proliferation; were there gendarmes and members of the FAR, or even policemen, who had deserted? 
A.	The management of operations has always come up against such problems, you know, desertion of posts and so on.  When you have an operational situation, these issues are there on a permanent basis because in the case of an attack by an -- adversary persons operating certain positions will be reversed.  And it is not certain that these persons will reassemble entirely, including their weapons, after.  And some of them take advantage of such situations to leave.  

All the more so because I've said from psychological and professional standpoints these people had not been trained the way we were used to training our soldiers.  The time frame of training was too short and the combat requirements brought these people to the frontline too early.  And I have no doubt that in the period before 6 April 1994, there were soldiers who had deserted.  Moreover in the Kigali prison, I visited the Kigali centre prison and I saw soldiers, close to 800, who were in prison in Kigali with the same issue of indiscipline and, notably, desertion.  

So, what you are saying is true.  Even more so, in the period after 6th April 1994, because that is what I tried to explain yesterday with the war that took us unawares, with lots of soldiers spread all over within their families, the various neighbourhoods in Kigali and out of Kigali, and who with the abruptness and escalation of the situation could not go back to their units.  And I must assure you that these people constituted a serious threat to the country's security because amongst them there were big criminals who suddenly participated in killings, rapes, and so on.  So the situation is very real and what you are saying is very, very real. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I am asking you this question because we have seen pictures of roadblocks where soldiers -- or apparently soldiers are standing together with civilians; so is that an explanation of that presence or are there other explanations? 
A.	It may be an explanation, but I don't know about the roadblock you are talking about.  I don't know the people who were there.  I don't have any facts to work upon to say with any accuracy whether -- who it was.  But it is possible because you had all kinds of things within the population.  It was possible. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, during the events did you go to the Saint Paul and Sainte Famille sites? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Yes, I went to the Saint Paul site and that of Sainte Famille, just once; and if I remember well, it was on 16 June in the afternoon.  I accompanied General Aniyidoho to that site.  He had a message to put across to the refugees, so we saw the church.  We went through the buildings of Sainte Famille to Saint Paul.  And then we moved around and I came back.  So I visited the site on that date.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That was number 16?  
MR. CANTIER: 
That is correct, Mr. President, 1-6.  General Aniyidoho. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	What was the precise function or post of General Aniyidoho? 
A.	General Aniyidoho was a deputy commander of the UNIMAR troops and he was essentially in charge of humanitarian issues. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, do you know about the book that General Aniyidoho wrote:  Guns Over Kigali?  There is only an English version of that book.  
A.	Yes, Counsel, I've read that book. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, that document is found in our list.  It is number 29.  That document is two pages long.  Mr. President, I would like to cite the passages that concern what Mr. Renzaho has talked about.  They are found at the end of page 89, the last six lines.  Then the first eight lines of number 90, page 90. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This is something you want to tender as an exhibit later on?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
If that is the case, maybe we do not have to read this excerpt from the book into the record.  Maybe we can simply note that it is here.  Then you can tender it and maybe you can ask Mr. Renzaho now whether he agrees with what is here. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Renzaho, you have before you that passage in which General Aniyidoho narrates his intervention in your company at that site of Saint Paul, of Sainte Famille, on 16 June 1994.  So can you tell the Chamber whether you agree with that account of events and what is your comment thereon? 
A.	Yes, I agree with the facts because the event took place.  But my comment would be that there was an interruption in the process, in the transfer of refugees to the places where they wanted to go.  And the problem was that RPF troops had shot at -- had fired upon the convoy, the UNAMIR convoy and so there was a suspension of the activities.  Activities were suspended and then the UNAMIR authorities began contacting its partners in order to resume operations.  Had just announced to the refugees that the very next day -- the very next day, the activities would resume, the transfer of the refugees to their place of choice.  This is what was said to the refugees at Sainte Famille and Saint Paul.  

And I regret that only two hours after we were on the spot, the RPF had fired very heavy, 
deadly shelling on the site.  Yes, 1,800 refugees were taken away.  But many other people were killed, were massacred on the site.  It has not been said, but that is the truth.  In Saint Paul itself, and principally at the primary school where there were Hutus from Kagugu and Gisozi, and amongst whom were people displaced by the war.  Those people were slaughtered with bayonets and knives.  And others hearing the screams fled.  

But that's what happened in the night of the 16th to the 17th.  And the attack ended at the break of day on the 17th.  And we can go on later to discuss what happened later on the 17th. 
(Pages 19 to 33 by Melissa Hook)







1215H 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, did you have an active role?  Were you merely by the side of that general at the time of the visit on the 16th of June, or did you speak to the people?  
A.	Counsel, I don't think I was the only one there, there was also the ICRC, there were journalists, there were many other people.  But to answer quite directly to your question, I did not play any particular role because I did not hold a meeting with the people.  We just stopped at various points to speak to the people and try and comfort them, appealing to them to be patient, to be brave, and telling them that tomorrow we will resume transferring refugees and doing what we can for it to go well.  That was our message to the people.  Otherwise, I didn't organise a meeting as such with the people, the refugees there.  Thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, you explained to us this morning that the people at Saint Paul and Sainte Famille were among the people PVK was taking care of.  Now, who -- who was in charge of supervising those sites?  Who at the PVK was in charge of supervising those sites?  
A.	One of my assistants, Mr. Simbuga (sic), Aloys, was inter alia responsible for those sites, because there were other sites for which he was responsible.  But he was there consistently because, first of all, the site was -- was where there was perhaps the greatest number of refugees.  Because at Sainte Famille, even if people did gradually leave it to go other places, there were up to 18,000 people there, so it was a very big, important site.  A lot of people there.  So he was there practically every day.  He also visited other sites, but he'd visit that one every day.  Thank you, Counsel.  
Q.	Thank you very much.  
A.	It was Simpunga, Aloys, who was inter alia responsible for that site, and he'd go there every day.  
Q.	Was that site, or those sites, Saint Paul-Sainte Famille, did any major events occur there of which you were informed, of course, at the time? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Incidents were inevitable, but this could have been avoided, and that is the contrast I'd like to perhaps point out -- point to.  The incidents occurred at the site several times.  They were incidents connected to the war, because the site was shelled, as far as I know, on the 12th of April, the 16th of April; intense shelling on the 1st of May, the 3rd of May, and it was attacked in the night of the 16th to the 17th.  

Incidents connected with disturbances among the people, Hakizimana came here -- his version of the events might be different from what we really knew happened.  But those incidents did occur at that site.  

So to answer your question, those incidents occurred, and the attacks drove me to see to what extent we could show the RPF very visibly that there were people and they should avoid going on continuing to shell those sites.  That is how I tried to involve the UNAMIR officials in putting a unit there, posting a unit there, so that the UN flag could fly there.  But the situation, as we knew, it was difficult, and it is possible that UNAMIR did not have sufficient personnel to post a unit there.  It wasn't possible right until the end.  There never was a unit posted there.  But I know that teams of observers were instructed to frequently go there, but I would have liked the flag to be flown there to show the RPF that there were people there and that they should not shell the place.  

So the contrast is the following:  It's that, precisely, there were people, there were those refugees, but some wondered why, for example, there wasn't a big unit posted there to protect the site. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Renzaho, that was the question I was going to put to you.  As far as UNAMIR is concerned, you have told us that -- explained that there wasn't a permanent presence, but that observers would pass.  Now, as regards the gendarmerie, as of what date were gendarmes posted there, and how many were detached to guard those two sites? 
A.	Well, I think the gendarme were there as of the 9th of April 1994, but not very many because there were not many available.  There was not even a complete section, so it was about 11 people.  What I know is that there was an officer -- commanding officer.  The problem wasn't immediately of any significance inasmuch as it was sufficiently far from the battle front, from the front line, and those few gendarme would be enough to ensure supervision, and in the case of a crisis call for reinforcements to face up to the menace.  But unfortunately, through lack of reserve units, reserve troops, they were not available. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, can you tell us the name of the commanding officer in charge of the platoon, commanding the platoon? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  You spoke of a platoon.  Well, a platoon, in the terminology -- or, the jargon I'm used to, a platoon would be 35 to 45 people. 
Q.	I'm sorry, Mr. Renzaho.  My military studies are -- were a long time ago.  Let us say the unit.  
A.	Right.  The unit.  Okay.  Well, the officer on the spot, already named by Father Hakizimana -- well, whoever was in charge of the centre there -- was Iradukunda.  But before him, probably other officers were posted there.  But Iradukunda was inter alia in charge of the group. 
Q.	What is the first letter of that name?  
A.	I-R-A-B-U-K-U-N-D-A (sic).  Iradukunda. 
Q.	It is not on the list.  Mr. Renzaho, did you come to learn of an UNAMIR report dated the 1st of May 1994 concerning events that occurred at those sites on that date? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, there's a document on our list number 4, document number 19.  The document only exists in the English version.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, it is point 3 of the document, paragraph 3, number 3, which mentions the shelling of the 1st of May and which shows the number of people killed and wounded.  Is this the event you were referring to before? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, that is the event I was referring to.  
Q.	Do you have any comment to make on this document that I have just submitted to you?  
A.	Counsel, I think this document confirms what I have just said.  These were the most serious events recorded.  But unfortunately, the site was in a secteur which was most often shelled by the troops on the other side, on the other hill, Kacyiru, Kimihurura.  And maybe the shells overshot or undershot, but they would fall there.  
Q.	Do you -- did you come to learn of a document from UNAMIR dated the 2nd of May 1994?  It's document 20 in list 4.  Another document that only exists in English.
A.	Could you please refresh my memory?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Asks the Accused.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	It also mentions the incident, but in broader -- in more detail.  
A.	Yes, Counsel, I know that when this occurred, there was some argument as to where the shelling was coming from, and I remember that some people were even saying that the shelling was by Rwandan government forces, which is impossible.  The RGF couldn't shoot at themselves.  That would be impossible.  And the second report confirms exactly where the shelling was from and who was responsible for it, if my memory serves me right.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, did you know who had taken responsibility for Saint Paul and Sainte Famille sites?  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  I knew from the reports I would receive from Simpunga that there were two priests responsible for the sites.  And regarding the second one, in any case, there were -- there was, at any event -- there was an event that led to my contact with him by telephone.  But to answer your question, yes, I knew that there were two priests, clergymen, one in charge of Saint Paul, the other in charge of Sainte Famille. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, could you give the Trial Chamber the names, respectively, of those two clergymen and the sites they were responsible for?  
A.	Well, might I not run the risk of revealing --  
Q.	No, no, no.  Those people are known.  You can mention their names here, but without more details.  
A.	So it was Father Hakizimana, Célestin, at Saint Paul; and Sainte Famille it was Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka.  
Q.	Well, I was asking you, Mr. Renzaho, if you knew them.  You answered no.  But you did say that you had -- you did communicate with one of them at a certain stage.  Can you tell us who it was, since we're talking of two clergymen?  And, secondly, what was the purpose of the telephone conversation?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka is the person in question, and the event occurred on the 10th of April 1994.  And that is when the people had fled from the secteurs occupied by the RPF.  And they came in great numbers to seek refuge at Sainte Famille, but they found already the first occupants in all the buildings, in the church, and in the adjacent premises.  And those people's fury blinded them, and they attacked Father Munyeshyaka and told him to get the rich inhabitants out, under the pretext that they were Tutsi, and it was they who had suffered so much who should be able to stay there.  The crowd was very -- was immense, and he took the telephone and called me, it was the only phone call I received, and he told me of the problem.  And I answered that one should respect the principle of first come.  You couldn't solve the problem by creating another problem.  

That being said, I sent a policeman or two.  And when they got there, they found that Father Munyeshyaka had already found a solution to the problem.  He'd succeeded in placing some of them in the primary school building at Sainte Famille, and others, as I had suggested to him, he told them to go and seek shelter in the numerous annexes in Nyarugenge on porches, or whatnot.  But -- for the time being, as a temporary measure.  That is what happened then.  Thank you. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, did you meet, physically, Father Munyeshyaka during the -- at the time of the events?  Maybe in a meeting, did you get to meet him?  
A.	That priest was not known to me.  He was a young priest, and I did not know him.  I know that later on he asked for a vehicle, a truck, to move foodstuff (unintelligible).  At first, the foodstuff was found in the warehouse of Caritas near La Rwandaise, and later on it was moved from the warehouse of Caritas to the Nyamirambo school.  And I asked that he be assigned one of the trucks of the préfecture.  That is my relationship with the priest, because I was impressed with his courage in the face of adversity. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This warehouse of Caritas was close to where, you said?  Just repeat the location.  Just -- 
THE WITNESS:
Close to La Rwandaise.  La Rwandaise was a company that was very visible so Caritas, was close to La Rwandaise.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
MR. CANTIER: 
I can't find it on the list.  But it is a form of "rwandais" with an "E" at the end.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, you knew of the attacks on these sites -- at least you knew of it here from witnesses who came here.  The attacks were not like shellings that were mentioned, but incursions, attempts, or forays from Interahamwe militia.  So can you tell us what you know about it?  Were you informed at the time, and did you have to deal with such matters? 
A.	Counsel, I may disappoint you, but I was not directly contacted to deal with that situation.  And I may explain further.  
Q.	Yes, because it was stated here that a telephone call -- that you received a telephone call from one of the -- the officials that we've just talked about.  You received a telephone call, and you did not act on that telephone call.  Could you talk about that situation, notably mentioning the date or whether such a phone call was made or not? 
A.	First I must tell you that sincerely, in my heart and in my conscience, I received no phone call from anybody asking me to help out at Sainte Famille or Saint Paul, so I don't see any date here.  Because when the incident of the 14th happened, I was not in Kigali and I couldn't have been called on the 14th.  And so what other incident could have happened that was not mentioned?  I don't know.  

So was it the incident of the 17th of June 1994?  Well, I have explained what happened on the night of 16th to the 17th June.  Early in the morning -- 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I have to interrupt you, because that is not the question I asked.  My question was precise:  Did you receive a phone call from one of these responsible officials we mentioned asking you to intervene?  
A.	No. 
Q.	Second question:  Did you receive a phone call from a priest, from a priest you know, and who also requested your intervention?  
A.	Counsel, I learnt of all that after I came here.  And to tell you the truth, during the period under consideration I did not receive any call from anybody.  And I think that it is a priest that I knew with whom I lived during my secondary school days, a friend whom I knew very well.  That allegation saddens me, because it is not in my nature, and I would really like to straighten things out.  

So that is why I sent our investigator back in the country to go and check out the information with the priests concerned.  Then he learned that the priest was in Rwankuba parish, to the north of the former Kigali-rural.  Because things have changed now.  Unfortunately, when he got there, he was informed that the priest had died a few weeks before.  

So my curiosity for information could not be satisfied.  So I don't know whether my memory has been blunted to the point where I cannot remember a phone call that I received, especially from a friend that I knew very well.  Moreover, I do not know why I would not have reacted.  If I could do it for others, why would I refuse to intervene at the Saint Paul centre at the request of somebody that I knew very well?  So I think somehow there is a mistake that I cannot place my finger on.  Thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, if such a phone call were made to the PVK, would it have been forwarded to you automatically?  
A.	Counsel, I was not at the PVK all the time, sometimes I moved, and there were other persons to whom such a message could be forwarded.  So the message would come into the secretariat of the préfecture, then it would be processed by the crisis committee, and the civil servant in charge would be found, or the message could be sent to Simpunga to intervene on that side, because he did it often.  He was in permanent contact with the Saint Paul and Sainte Famille sites.  So it was possible.  I was not indispensable to do everything.  That is why we were organised -- we were an organisation -- because organisation helps to lighten problems.  Thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, we're still on the site, the Saint Paul and Sainte Famille site.  Did you give orders on 14 June 1994 for a number of persons to be arrested, persons whose name you had drawn up on a list? 
A.	Counsel, you speak of the 14th of June 1994.  If you are talking about that date, then I must tell the Chamber that I was not in Kigali, so I do not know who drew up that list.  I never drew up any lists in the period April to July.  What list?  No.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, you were aware of the incident, to put it lightly.  So who do you hold responsible for it?  Who drew up the list that has been mentioned by many witnesses, both Prosecution and Defence witnesses?  
A.	Counsel, allow me a little time to develop further on the incident of 14 June.  It won't take much time.  I'll try to be brief.  

Responsibility for that incident lies on the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge commune who received the information and processed it.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I'll interrupt you for some time.  Did you give instructions, or orders, to that effect to the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge?  Answer yes or no.  
A.	No.  I could not have given an order while I was away, no. 
Q.	Well, now that you've answered clearly, could you give the explanations that you wanted to give, very briefly?  
A.	Well, the explanations have to do with the way the incident was handled.  We do agree that the site was guarded by gendarmes.  According to information that was sent to me, the incident was reported to the bourgmestre by the conseiller of the secteur on the 13th of June in the evening, that they had information on a possible attack on the Sainte Famille site.  There were persons who were being looked for by people, and they were in that site.  And thinking that it could prevent the incident, the bourgmestres probably prepared a memo for the gendarmerie before the population could storm the Saint Paul centre, because there were refugees and the consequences of such a move on them would be incalculable.  So maybe that was his motivation.  

Now, concerning the way he intervened, maybe that would have been a problem.  And according to the statement of Father Hakizimana (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover) the following emerged:  The petition written by the bourgmestre asking for the intervention of gendarmerie was intervened; otherwise, I don't see how the gendarmerie would intervene without seeing a request to that effect.  In the execution of that operation, that I situate in the category of law and order operations, I think that is where the problem lies.  

The officer in charge of executing the mission came with a number of gendarme -- gendarmes.  I don't have the exact figure.  And it would appear that when they got to the Saint Paul centre, they included a group -- some members of the group of assailants who were there.  Then they went and searched the centre to get the persons who were -- whose names we found on the famous list.  

And that is the crux of the matter.  Because to involve members of the crowd of demonstrators in a search operation is already an infringement on the regular procedure, because inasmuch as a public force is in charge of an operation, it is out of the question to include some of the demonstrators.  That is clear.  And to add to it the information (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover) from Father Hakizimana, he said that prior to that he had received information, and he asked the persons who were being looked for to hide themselves further off.  It means that the search did not yield anything.  And since they found nothing, it became a problem, and it was difficult to explain that to the crowd that was there, because some of the members of the crowd had been involved in the operation.  That is what went out of hand.  And it would appear that the officer was not courageous enough to take control of the situation, to ask for reinforcement; and from what I heard from the father, the officer fled.  He escaped. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, there are two problems here.  I have to interrupt you.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And one sentence which is problematic is the following:  I'll read in English.  Listen whether you said this:  

"The petition written by the bourgmestre asking for the intervention on gendarmerie was intervened".  

Did you say that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  The petition written by the bourgmestre asking for the intervention of the gendarmerie was forwarded to the gendarmerie authorities, yes, asking for their intervention.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It was forwarded.  Thank you.  

And then your problems, Mâitre Cantier.  You mentioned two. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, there is a problem with Mr. Renzaho's assertions on two occasions.  Maybe the Chamber would look at that in a moment; two statements that reveal things that should not be known.  I heard him twice.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why don't we simply agree that his last long answer will not be transmitted by the video booth, and then we will analyse it in peace and quiet afterwards and decide which portions to be deleted.   

Thank you for that.  

Is this a good moment, Mâitre Cantier, or do you want to finish something before the break?  
MR. CANTIER: 
A small question on what Mr. Renzaho has said so that things should be clear in our minds.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, your narration that you've just made, is it an analysis of the situation -- a present analysis of the situation, or is it an analysis that you did before?  
A.	Thank you.  It is an analysis that I made, immediately, I had knowledge of that information, because I continued to work to see how that incident could have happened the way it did.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  That was my last little question, for purposes of time.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  We will resume at three, and we understand that you are on schedule to finish today.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President.  And I believe that I will give my learned colleague the opportunity to begin his cross-examination very soon.  I know he's impatient, and I'll give him the floor this afternoon. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  

The Court is adjourned until 3 o'clock. 
(Court recessed from 1300H to 1500H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mâitre Cantier. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Renzaho, I wish to continue and conclude on the episode of the 14th of June of 1994, and I wish to ask you how you heard about what had happened, and what was your reaction, if any, vis-à-vis the bourgmestre? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I heard about the incident on the 14th of June of 1994 through the refugees who were at the préfecture of Kigali town, upon my return from a mission.  I had made a small trip to Cyangugu in order to see how my family was.  And I heard that there had been an incident at Saint Paul's, and the refugees were angry at the bourgmestre of the commune. 

It was not necessary for me to summon him to my office, everything was settled outside of the building.  Because immediately upon my arrival they surrounded me, they started gesticulating and saying that during my absence serious things had happened, and that there had even been refugees amongst them who had been displaced.  So the incidents took place almost during the same period. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, sorry to interrupt, but when was it that what you're telling us about took place? 
A.	I came back to Kigali on the 15th in the evening, I entered the town, and when I was entering the building I saw the refugees who were sleeping over there, and they came to greet me and told me that some of them had been transferred to the Mille Collines hotel, and that an incident had also taken place at the Saint Paul's centre during which the bourgmestre had not acted in a responsible manner.  I remember having gone to the meeting room where the largest number of refugees had been staying, and I indeed noticed that the number of refugees had decreased.  I asked what had happened for this incident to take place.  I was given explanations which I did not find convincing from him.  And I must say that I was in a bad mood, and I was quite angry, and told him that such things were unacceptable and that in such circumstances he should have waited at least until my return, since I had accepted to shelter these people and that the decision to take some out was mine.  No foreigner was to enter the premises in order to threaten the refugees.  

Regarding the incident in Saint Paul's, he simply told me that there had indeed been an incident, but he did not provide any details, and I was not given any comprehensive report to know how it started, what his reaction was, and how the incident concluded.  

Subsequently, Aloys Simpunga gave some information to me.  It seems that on that occasion he went on the site.  And he regretted the fact that the bourgmestre was not on the site at the moment -- or at the time when the incident had taken place.  So this is what happened.  I must say that I was disgusted, but it was not the only incident.  I was faced with a difficult situation in that I had people at my disposal who were incompetent, and when any problem arose had as only objective their own safety.  So this was a problem I was faced with.  I thank you. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, are we to understand that during your absence there were other decisions made by the bourgmestre which were not agreeable to you?  I do not know whether the Trial Chamber understood you correctly.  In any case, I did not understand you correctly.  I was simply putting a question to you on your reaction vis-à-vis that person when you heard about what had happened in Saint Paul's on the 14th of June.  I believe you answered that question, but you did refer to other events.  Could you very briefly tell us what those events are?  
A.	Well, the two events, the Saint Paul's incident and the first incident I referred to before the Saint Paul's incident, took place at the same time.  When I came back from the mission, I met with refugees who told me that some of them had been abducted and transferred at the Mille Collines hotel.  And at the same time, I was told that it was not the only incident that had occurred, and that there had been people who had been abducted from the Saint Paul's centre.  So when I received the information, I also got the information on that second event.  
Now, as regards the initiative, it was an unfortunate act to transfer the people towards Mille Collines.  The Mille Collines hotel was overcrowded, even if part of the Congolese people who were there had been transferred to the Congo.  Mille Collines was overcrowded so we had no guarantee that any people who would be sent there would be treated well.  So it was a bad initiative.  That was my sentiment.  

And it was not the only thing.  The way he behaved during the Saint Paul incident, I considered unfortunate.  It was unfortunate that in such a matter the person in charge of the administration was not able to monitor the situation from its beginning to its end.  And, in fact, we were told that the young people who were allegedly abducted -- or rather, who were abducted -- as was stated by a number of witnesses, were taken to one location and were killed.  Or, whether there were negotiations so that some of the people who were abducted at Saint Paul's were heard over the airways of Radio Muhabura stating that one day they would come back with the RPF troops.  

So that is the last piece of information I was given.  I heard this, and I saw it in an UNAMIR document.  UNAMIR did conduct an investigation on this incident and found no conclusive evidence.  But I could reach a conclusion because there was a presence of an administrative authority on the location.  But, unfortunately, that administrative authority did not monitor the situation until its end, and that was the reason for my anger.  It was an unfortunate initiative on his part. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I believe you had wished to intervene?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just proceed.  Thank you.  It was a bit too fast for a while, Mr. Renzaho, but then you slowed down again.  Just remember the speed.  Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
I shall do so Mr. President. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, did you know the head of the intelligence service who was in Kigali from August of 1994 to June of 1995? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, I know him.  
Q.	Could you give us his name?  
A.	It is Mr. Sixbert Musangamfura.  And during the time when I was préfet of the town of Kigali, he was the chief editor of the Isibo newspaper in Kigali and was quite well known. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Number 321 on our spelling list, Mr. President.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, do you know whether that person ever conducted investigations on the actions of Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka? 
A.	Counsel, yes, I am aware of that. 
Q.	Do you know what were the conclusions of his investigation?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  An investigation was conducted on the behaviour of Munyeshyaka during the events from April to June following a request made by the Rwandan authorities; and besides, by the president and the vice-president of the republic, as I was told.  The investigation was conducted jointly by the military intelligence directorate and the civilian intelligence department that replaced the previous central intelligence department at a time when the state secretariat had just been created in order to monitor security matters in Rwanda.  Musangamfura was appointed as head of the civilian branch of the intelligence service.  So the investigation concluded that the charges brought against that priest were not valid.  
Q.	Could you be more specific, Mr. Renzaho, when you're saying that the charges are not valid?  For what reason?  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
When was this examination or investigation carried out?  
THE WITNESS:
The investigations were conducted in 1995 after the department I referred to was created.  And in 1996 the person concerned, that is to say, Sixbert Musangamfura, had to leave Rwanda. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And now the answer to Mâitre Cantier's question.  He asked you to be more specific when you are saying that the charges were not valid.  For what reason?  
MR. MOSES: 
It may be that, Your Honour -- it does allow the question, but I do object to it because it seems to me that it's encouraging, in a back-door manner, once again, by inference, a criticism of the Prosecution witnesses and their credibility, possibly.  I don't believe Mr. -- the person involved has actually indicated who he met.  

I have been disclosed some material, which is of a general nature, and it would seem to me that without knowing who he has spoken to, it is of little relevance.  And even if he had spoken to people, it then raises the objection that I raised yesterday regarding an alleged criticism of any Prosecution witnesses through a back-door mode. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is there any particular document entering into play here, Mâitre Cantier, or is this simply oral evidence?  Let's start in that end. 

MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, my wish was first to put these questions to Mr. Renzaho, and then subsequently propose documents to the Trial Chamber, as we usually do, which would confirm the statements by the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What are the possible documents we are approaching here?  Are they in list 4, or somewhere else?  
MR. MOSES: 
Without putting words into my learned friend (sic), they are, I believe, number 17 and 18 in folder number 1 of the Defence that they supplied.  And they are process verbal and commission rogatoire.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mâitre Cantier, number 17 and 18 do indeed seem to refer to Mr. Musangamfura.  These are the relevant documents. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President.  But before I put them to Mr. Renzaho, as we customarily do, wish to put questions to him on this issue before I request that the said documents be tendered into evidence so as to read out excerpts to Mr. Renzaho. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But are we not, then, in the same situation as yesterday, with the only difference that this time you very wisely ask questions before you present the documents?  
MR. CANTIER: 
I believe I tried in this way to follow the ruling of the Trial Chamber, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But are you not, then, trying through this witness to introduce a document against a certain person who might have been used in proceedings previously in this Tribunal?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Not at all, Mr. President.  The documents do not concern any other individual and only refer to the investigation that was requested from the head of Rwandan intelligence services and DMI, since these were two different organisations, on the suspicions on Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka.  And, of course, he is not the one who is being tried here.  
(Pages 34 to 45 by Vicki Eastvold)









1530H 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Which portion is relevant in document 17, and which part may be of relevance in document 18?  Can you help us, please?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, first of all, the whole document and its contents is relevant.  The sentences I have underscored are on the second page of that document, and we only have it in French.  It's the fourth paragraph where that person refers to the position he or she had held.  

The following page, the first and the fourth paragraphs were -- or, rather, in which that person tells us what his or her position was at the head of the intelligence service, and the mission entrusted to him or her regarding the activities of Munyeshyaka.  

The following page, first paragraph.  And then in the third paragraph, the last sentence, "No evidence was found to support any of these charges."  And the fourth paragraph, and more specifically the five first lines thereof.  

On the following page, the paragraph, or the sentence, "Thus people accused Munyeshyaka because he sought refuge in France, accused of supporting the Hutu Power."  At the bottom of the page, the response, "The people who were speaking in favour of Munyeshyaka were reduced to silence."  And what follows -- I'm sorry, I'm going too fast.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, that's fine.  An indication is enough.  Yes.  

Now, that is what is relevant in document 17; is that so?  According to you.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, and one last point on the last-but-one page.  I believe it is the last sentence with the name of a person I do not wish to name, since it seems be -- to be someone who alleges himself or herself to be a victim, so that person says that she was not raped and that to her knowledge no one had been raped by Munyeshyaka.  

So, Mr. President, those are the sentences that I would like to insist on, but the whole document is relevant.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Moses, this is a document which does not concern directly a previous witness in this case.  What is the objection, then, compared to the situation yesterday?  Because here is a matter of disseminating information about someone else in the indictment, but not throwing doubt on the credibility of the previous witness in the case whose statements should have been put to him or her.  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, if it was going to be left on that basis, namely that this was an interview of someone who conducted an investigation of who -- what witnesses he spoke to other than one person who is named who isn't our witness, perhaps there would be no objection.  I am aware that there must be a reason for the Defence wishing this to go in, and it is without doubt, in my submission, because they will wish to rely upon it to then turn around and have a go at any of our witnesses and their credibility on the basis of this document, and to say that any such statements must have been invented because there has been an investigation of witnesses and nothing's shown.  Otherwise, what probative value does the document have?  It has absolutely no probative value if it isn't mentioning any of our witnesses.  It can only be -- have any probative value if the Defence intend, down the line, to in fact use it.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The purpose must be to say that Mr. Renzaho is not to blame, but another person is to blame -- or, Mr. Munyeshyaka -- sorry.  Mr. Munyeshyaka is actually -- has not played the role as Prosecution witnesses have said he has done.  But should then, according to your logic, this document have been put to every Prosecution witness that alleged that Mr. Munyeshyaka behaved in a wrong manner?  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, it may simply be easier to proceed in the way Your Honour's suggesting, and I'll make submissions about weight at the end of the case.  I must say, and must submit, that on what has been quoted there, it -- the purpose must be to have a back-door go at our Sainte Famille witnesses, who testified not only about the activities of Mr. Munyeshyaka, but also by -- on the activities of the Accused.  And that clearly is, in my submission, the reason why my learned friend is -- is keen to introduce this document.  But I won't take in any further.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But let me just ask you, did you notice the last reference by Maître Cantier?  There he is referring to an episode concerning rape.  It's on the penultimate page of the document.  Does that raise an issue in connection with a particular Prosecution witness?  That person did not testify?  
MR. MOSES: 
No, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Mr. Cantier, when did you come to know about these two documents?  Specifically, before or after the Prosecution case?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Your Honour, the workload was so considerable and during successive periods that, when we compiled the documents and analysed them in order to prepare the Defence case, I cannot tell you with certainty when I got such documents, physically.  But to answer you in a few words, my interest in this document, first and foremost, is Father Munyeshyaka, because he is mentioned in the conspiracy along with Munyeshyaka (sic).  That is why I am interested in knowing what comes out of the charges brought against him.  
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And finally, why didn't you call the author of this document as a witness?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you for your question, Mr. President.  We have experienced problems with witnesses, as I mentioned.  On several occasions there were threats, and other witnesses just don't come because they do not wish to do so.  The list would be a lengthy one, but you can well imagine that if I had been able to convince him to come here, he would have come to testify.  And, of course, the Defence case would have been much stronger if he could have come to testify.  Unfortunately that was not so, and this is why I need to make use of these documents. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This investigation by Mr. Musangamfura, did that lead to a written report?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I do not know about that.  What I do know is that on -- on the basis of the two documents, the first one being document number 17, the interrogation of Mr. Musangamfura by a (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and filed under separate cover) investigator in the town of (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and filed under separate cover), following an international rogatory -- a French international rogatory commission.  Mr. President, Your Honours, it obviously took place within the framework of the investigation launched in France against that priest.  

The second document is the summary report of the said investigation which has been produced by a judicial police officer, who is also implementing the decisions of a French investigative judge within the framework of a rogatory commission.  And the name of that judge is on the document.  

But, Mr. President -- and I believe this is just an assumption on my part.  You do know that Father Munyeshyaka was charged and judged in Rwanda.  So I assume that what is being referred to by the witness, or at least by Mr.  Musangamfura in his -- during his interrogation has to do with the investigation carried out on the case of Father Munyeshyaka.  But this is merely an assumption; I don't know more about that.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But Mr. Munyeshyaka was convicted in absentia, wasn't he, in Rwanda?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, in Rwanda.  But in France -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Whereas -- whereas this documentation goes in the direction that Mr. Munyeshyaka did not commit criminal acts; is that so?  That's the elements you have kindly indicated by showing us paragraphs.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, but it's a sequence.  I shouldn't like to speak on other components of which I have no knowledge.  But this is from the sequence of his proceedings -- judicial proceedings in France.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But if there is no written report from this investigation, all we have is inquiries and procès-verbal.  Isn't that tantamount to, at least, if you want to tender this document later, to try to circumvent Rule 92 bis, an unwilling witness's statement will then be part of the record instead of hearing him directly before this Court, which is the key of the objection?  I think this is the last question we have to ask you before we reflect on this situation.  Isn't this an indirect way to have testimony -- admittedly only a statement -- but what you would have expected the witness to come to say before this Court, and then without cross-examination of the witness, nor any declaration to tell the truth?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I'm quite aware that the evidential material is brought by a witness that is called to testify and cross-examined.  In the instant, the person is not here.  But there's a document that is of important probative value for the Defence of Mr. Renzaho, and the -- the Bench can weigh it up.  But as a lawyer I am -- must go to the end of my duty to defend, without transgressing, of course.  This is not so much that person's testimony as an item of evidence.  We have all sorts of documents on the record that have a bearing -- illustrate the accused person's conduct.  It's -- it's not evidence that I'm trying to adduce surreptitiously.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This is an interesting question.  

Mr. Renzaho, do you have knowledge about the role of Mr. Munyeshyaka which is not based on these two documents?  
THE WITNESS: 
The role played by Munyeshyaka during the events of April 1994, well, I know that he took the refugees, many, many refugees, numerous refugees at Sainte Famille parish.  And not only at Sainte Famille parish, but in fact he transported provisions and mobilised charity organisations for refugees in -- at other religious establishments, at Saint Paul, Sainte Famille parish, the CELA, the Lycée -- the Lycée Notre Dame de Cíteaux, and I'm speaking of Charles Lwanga church in Nyamirambo.  Those were all church establishments, religious establishments, and it was Father Munyeshyaka who went to fetch provisions, foodstuffs, and distributed them.  But he was exclusively in charge of the refugees at Sainte Famille parish.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  I see -- I see that this was not so helpful.  

Let me ask you, Maître Cantier.  You want to solicit evidence from the Accused.  Now, is there any evidence from the Accused that you want to have which is not based on these two documents?  If the situation is simply that you want to let the Accused say what he has read in the documents, then we get into a difficult area.  But if you want to know what this Accused knows, irrespective of these two documents, there is a slight difference.  Do you see the difference?  I do not know exactly what you want to solicit from the Accused.  And if you could avoid this road which is pretty close to 92 bis, actually, and it falls outside 92 bis, then we would avoid the problem.  Is there a way out, before we rule?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, the questions I was putting to Mr. Renzaho, was -- I wanted to know whether he was aware of the manoeuvres with a view to accusing Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka, which manoeuvres are denounced in this document, The procès-verbal of Musangamfura, Sixbert.  And the Rwandan intelligence services were charged by he who was at the time vice-president of the republic to put together a file against Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka, which is part of the criminal conspiracy of which Mr. Renzaho is accused.  And what I wanted to do at the end of the questioning, as we usually do -- but my colleague could have objected then -- to tender this document as evidence in the knowledge that there are two documents, one being the procès-verbal of Mr. Musangamfura, Sixbert, and the other -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But, see, now you are doing exactly what we do not want.  You are going into these two documents.  

Mr. Renzaho, listen to the question now:  Do you have any knowledge whether there have been manoeuvres to falsely accuse Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka?  Do you have any such knowledge based on your own knowledge, not what you have read in documents?  
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, I am absolutely convinced of it.  I am certain, and I can give you examples.  I know, for example, the elimination of the Catholic hierarchy in Kabgayi, on about the 15th of June or just before in 1994, is part of that reasoning.  I have read considerable material on the situation regarding -- in respect of the question you've put, there is the book of Monseigneur Peraudin.  There are books written by other clergymen on the church's position as seen by the present regime.  I don't have the slightest doubt as to a policy wishing to diabolicise (sic) the Catholic church.  And that is associated with the history of our country.  If the social revolution of 1959 to '62 was originally denounced by the churches that felt that the regime of the time was unjust, iniquitous on the social, political, and cultural front, and asked that charity for all, justice for all be established in the country.  So it is not for nothing that those who returned to take power had in mind certainly something else, something against the church that had put an end to the regime -- the (unintelligible) regime, the previous monarchal regime in Rwanda.  

Just four days ago a priest died in Butare, and he wasn't properly buried, he was thrown in a garbage pail where he was eaten by dogs.  We've heard that news.  So they had something against the Catholic church, and perhaps especially the Hutu clergymen who are denounced by their co-religionists (sic).  Thank you, President.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The name mentioned before was 341, court reporter.  Musangamfura, Sixbert.  Sorry.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
In case you make a request to tender these two documents, Maître Cantier, we will deny them.  We are not going to allow a request to tender these two documents, based on the fact that these are documents from a witness which is not appearing before the Court.  He should have been called.  

But you have now obtained that the Accused, through his knowledge, has thrown light on an area which you consider important.  Do you have any other questions within this area?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, forgive me, but the two documents are not of the same nature.  The first document we are talking of is the procès-verbal d'interrogatoire of Mr. Musangamfura, Sixbert Eric, who, if you would have accepted, we would have called him to testify.  But the second document is not a procès-verbal record of questioning.  It's a procès-verbal de synthése, which is a summary prepared by a judicial police official after a rogatory mandate given to him by a magistrate.  So they are not of the same nature.  It is a police -- a judicial police report on instructions of a judge.  So it is of a different nature, Mr. President, Your Honours.  And I don't think, in my humble opinion, that the Trial Chamber should treat both documents in the same way.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You must not underestimate us, Maître Cantier.  We see the difference between the two documents.  But, you see, the substance also of the second document is to obtain the evidence of Mr. Sixbert Musangamfura, and that is the point in relation to 92 bis.  But let us now leave this discussion.  Our ruling in relation to both documents stands.  That is our view, even if we have now listened with great interest to your additional remark, drawing our attention to the different character of the two documents.  

Now remains the issue whether you have any further questions to Mr. Renzaho in this area.  Do you have that?  

BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, do you think that Father Munyeshyaka was thus the target of this procedure, according to what we've just said, in his capacity as a priest, as a clergyman, or in some other capacity?  
A.	Counsel, I am utterly, utterly convinced, and you have your -- yourself have heard the testimony of the witnesses who came here.  That priest did something -- admirable things for those refugees, and I'd even go very far, I'd say that his absence at that place, at that specific time, would certainly have been a catastrophe.  Because I do not see among his colleagues who would have dared to face danger and threats and go out and about as he did.  So I'm sure and I'm certain that it's not for non-assistance to the refugees which would -- would justify the accusations against him.  I think most sincerely that there must be a political reason to discredit that clergyman, as there has been against other priests.  And I live with priests where I am at the UNDF, and we talk together.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, a question occurs to us that comes to mind:  Do you remember what -- what Radio Muhabura would say about him?  
A.	Counsel, let me tell you that that radio generally considered the people who helped -- held in esteem the people that worked to their advantage.  And before the 1st of May, they had nothing but praise for Father Munyeshyaka.  Why?  Not only because he took care of the refugees, but -- and this perhaps a revelation to the Honourable Judges here present -- he dared to transport food supplies from the government lines to the RPF zone in Kabuga, which was where all -- all the people were gathered together, that the RPF had removed from various districts of Kigali.  And just up to then it was fine, he was the good disciple.  But when he revealed his thoughts to a group of journalists who came to Sainte Famille by criticising the irresponsible shelling of the Sainte Famille, which we spoke of before, and then he was the subject of all the fury that fell on his head.  That is the true situation.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Was that the end of this sequence?  
MR. CANTIER: 
That was about Mr. -- Father Munyeshyaka.  The extracts in the book, Noires fureurs, blancs menteurs, by someone called Pierre Pean, which would be -- which is quite interesting.  But the whole chapter is devoted to Father Wenceslas. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  Now, we need to make sure that we have not lost some elements here.  The first issue was the reference to a monseigneur whose name we have not have spelt.  Can we have some assistance there, please?  

You referred to that person in your long answer to me where I interrupted you, Mr. Renzaho.  Can you just spell the name of the author of that book you referred to?  He was a monseigneur, you said.  
THE WITNESS: 
Peraudin.  P-E-R-A-U-D-I-N.  P-E-R-A-U-D-I-N.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Very good.  And then we had this name mentioned by Maître Cantier, the last name after Pierre is Pean, P-E-A-N, I understand.  

Then there is the matter concerning the person whose statements we have not allowed being tendered and used during the last sequence.  There was a reference to his domicile.  Now he is, of course, not a protected witness in this Tribunal, so that should be unproblematic, even if refugee status often is a bit sensitive.  
MR. MOSES: 
Yes, I can't assist as to whether he is protected under any other court order.  That would be my only -- I'm unaware whether, for example, he has testified.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
In view of the fact that we do not know whether this is a potential witness in this Tribunal, we think the most correct thing to do is to place the name of the town at 15:42:20 -- and I will provide the spelling later -- and the indication of the nationality of the investigator.  So the trip carried out by investigators at 15:42:12, that will be placed under separate cover. 

Now you wanted to move on, Maître Cantier, to a new book; was that so?  Do you want to help us with the spelling of the title of that book, since you read it into the record?  I'm referring to Pierre Pean's book.  I think that was what you read into the record.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes.  You want the title, sir?  Noires fureurs, blancs menteurs. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Which means Black fury, white liar.  Black fury, white liar.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good.  That's sufficient for the English transcripts.  Then we have that.  What is your next question, please?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, I was saying a whole chapter is devoted to Father Wenceslas, and I should like to tender this document, and merely submit to Mr. Renzaho one sentence, to tell us what he thinks of it.  Which is the following, page 417 -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Now, please identify the document so that we know what we are talking about, and then we will see whether this also raises a procedural issue.  Is this in Defence volume 1, or list 4, or where are we?  
MR. CANTIER: 
It's in volume 2, tab 2.  

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
I don't think we have this one.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, volume 2, tab 2.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Actually, the translation, seeing that it's in the plural, should be Black furies, white liars.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you to the interpreter.  

Mr. Moses?  
MR. MOSES: 
With respect of this, Your Honour, I'm happy for -- I think I've had indicated a sentence.  It's in French, and perhaps we'll have it read out before I concede too much.  That page -- or, that line, it may be I have no objection.  So far as the chapter is concerned, it refers to a number of people who are known to us, both during the Prosecution and the Defence phase.  And if there is only one line that is going to be referred to, perhaps -- perhaps we can have a translation of that line and I'll indicate whether I object -- make any objection to that line.  But it may be that I'm happy for the fact -- or, that passage to be asked about, but not the whole chapter.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You referred us to page 417.  Which paragraph, please, Maître Cantier?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Page 417, third paragraph.  "I will spare" -- (French spoken).
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It's starting the words (French spoken), third paragraph -- or, second complete paragraph. 
MR. CANTIER:
I have a terrible feeling that we are being totally censored.  If we can produce no document -- this is a public -- public publication.  It's a book that's been sold many thousand copies.  If the Trial Chamber is not allowed to read what is in this chapter, well, then we can just sit down and let the Prosecutor prosecute all by himself.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
There has been no ruling by the Trial Chamber in relation to this book.  We now simply want to know what you want to use on page 417, and now you want to read out the paragraph (French spoken).  Please go ahead.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, it's because I do not want to unnecessarily lengthen your sittings that I have chosen a small sentence, while asking that the entire chapter be admitted, because it concerns someone who is part of the criminal conspiracy alleged by the Prosecution.  And I do not think that it is at all -- it is not relative to Mr. Renzaho's defence.  So I will read the sentence:  

"I will spare the reader all the favourable testimonies regarding Father Wenceslas that I have collected, with the exception of one that I have felt it necessary to publish because it is so paradoxical."  

That was the overall appreciation that I wanted to bring to the Trial Chamber's attention.  Now, of course the journalist explains exactly what she means in this chapter, which is not all that long.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But we have admitted books and books and books in many, many trials.  This is not an investigation or a statement from a particular witness; this is a book, so it's clear that you must be allowed to tender that document, Mr. Cantier.  And I doubt whether there will be any objection.  
MR. MOSES: 
If I could just point out a couple of things to Your Honours to assess.  And the reason why I -- I do, is that on page 411 --  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Paragraph?  
MR. MOSES: 
Three.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  
MR. MOSES: 
It refers to a person.  And I won't say any more.  

Similarly, it -- on page 414-15, it also refers -- page 414 on the third paragraph.  I don't know how it's going to be used, and I've got to -- I've got to say, Your Honour, I'm at a disadvantage, because it all is in French, and my French is not marvelous.  All I am saying and pointing out to Your Honours is that I'm -- I'm -- I am perhaps happy for that passage, and if it goes in as part of a -- the chapter, that is fine.  If it is going -- other parts of the chapter, in particular those which refer to matters which might fall within Your Honours' -- within Trial Chamber I's ruling -- I mean, I don't know.  And I -- I just wanted to raise Your Honours' awareness.  That was the reason for my objection.  It is because there is reference within the chapter to two persons.  So if Your Honours consider it able to go in on -- and there are no issues of 92 bis, then I'm happy to allow it to go in.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We don't see any problems here.  We will allow the chapter in.  So you can just add this to your list of documents that you will later indicate you want to have tendered in connection with your examination-in-chief.  

MR. CANTIER: 
The Defence takes due note of the interpretation of Rule 92 bis and will know how to use it properly and correctly without exception -- will apply it.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Renzaho, are you aware of the indictment issued by this Tribunal against Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka? 
A.	Yes, I have read it.  
Q.	Now, enough document questions.  Do you -- did you note any allegations in that document -- accusations levelled against Father Wenceslas that would be close to those levelled against you?  
A.	Yes, I found that in Wenceslas Munyeshyaka indictment, which, moreover, preceded mine, included allegations similar to those made in my indictment, and I asked myself, moreover, whether -- why it wouldn't have been so similar as to constitute a joint indictment.  Nonetheless, I found certain allegations, certain things said in my indictment, slightly differently additional things said that left me completely dumbfounded, so that as far as I'm concerned, there was a problem.  On the one hand, I couldn't not be aware of what I was accused of, but reading that indictment I was convinced that my initial reaction meant -- seemed to imply that people didn't -- were not aware of the situation on the ground, or something that I could not explain at all.  Thank you, Counsel.  I could perhaps -- 
Q.	Let me be more specific.  Is there a specific allegation made against you in your indictment that is also made against Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka?  If so, which one, and what comment would you like to make on that?  
A.	Yes, there was an accusation made against me regarding the kidnapping, abduction of people at the CELA that I handed over to Interahamwe to -- to be killed.  And the people named there are, in particular, the family of Mrs. Rose Rwanga.  That's what drew my attention in the first place.  And in Munyeshyaka's indictment, I found that the matter is mentioned in a different way.  

In my indictment the two Rwanga children, the boys and their father, were presented as victims among the unfortunately people who'd been handed over to the Interahamwe to be killed on the 22nd of April 1994 at the CELA, and I would -- allegedly I heard Madam Rwanga's asking -- begging for indulgence, because I am from the same region as that unfortunate family.  And in Munyeshyaka's indictment the two boys would have been killed in Munyeshyaka's presence on the 13th of April, which is already a bit strange.  
(Pages 46 to 56 by Kirstin McLean)






1630H 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho -- where, Mr. Renzaho? 
A.	At Sainte Famille. 
MR. MOSES:
Your Honours, I was aware that this issue was going to be raised, and I am not in any way wanting to prevent the issue being raised, but I think it is only fair that it is done in a proper manner.  An indictment is not evidence.  Your Honours, I think, were given a copy of the Munyeshyaka indictment by -- in the last bundle, I think it's bundle 4.  
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, my apologies, I forgot to specify to the Trial Chamber that is on our list number 4 -- number 28, the indictment of Mr. Munyeshyaka, dated the 20th of July 2005, and which was only published during the course of the month of July. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the issue we are discussing now is which part of the indictment? 
MR. MOSES:
In paragraphs 13, 14 and 15, and 25 is relevant as well, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and what is then your observation based on these four paragraphs, Mr. Moses?  
MR. MOSES:
Your Honours, in 13, 14 and 15 there's reference in paragraph 13 to an 18-year-old Tutsi girl, the daughter of Rose Rwanga, unnamed.  

Paragraph 14 refers to a 20-year-old Tutsi boy, unnamed, the son of Rose Rwanga; and in 
paragraph 15, reference to a 22-year-old Tutsi girl, unnamed, daughter of Rose Rwanga, all alleged in the indictment to have been killed by Father Munyeshyaka on the 13th of April.  

In paragraph 25, there is a specific count that on the 17th of June at Sainte Famille parish, Munyeshyaka instigated the Interahamwe to kill a Tutsi girl named Hyacinthe Rwanga, alias Bébé, which is, as Your Honours would be aware, the allegation that we have led evidence about.  

So, it was raised on Friday and that's why on Monday we disclosed the supporting material for the indictment.  And there was a single witness statement which was the basis of paragraphs 13, 14 and 15 that was disclosed on Monday with the name.  

Now, I am happy for Your Honours to see that statement because it was only recently provided to the Defence, and it may be that Your Honours consider that in fairness to the Defence, you will accept that that would go against the earlier -- the earlier ruling, but there are in terms of the issue that, I think Judge Egorov raised earlier, as to when the Defence obtained that information, I'm not objecting to Your Honours seeing the basis for the supporting material for those paragraphs.  

An indictment, of course, Your Honour -- there were, of course, I believe three or four statements supporting the allegation in paragraph 25; namely, that Hyacinthe Rwanga was killed on the 
17th of June.  My concern, Your Honours, with the way in which this is going, and I want to alert my friends to it, is that if my friends wish -- I'm happy for that evidence -- that document to be shown to you, because I'm not wanting to hide it from the Trial Chamber.  And, in fairness to the Defence, it may be that Your Honours wish to admit it to be able to weigh it up and to compare it with any other evidence.  

My concern and the issue I want to raise is that if they want to get into the supporting material for the basis of another indictment which isn't evidence, then I will seek to introduce the lot.  And my learned friend has been served with it all, and he will be well aware that there is material in there which was not led, which may -- one, be corroborative; or secondly, inculpatory towards this Accused.  

So, I don't know how far my friend is wishing to take this matter.  Your Honours will be well aware that with an indictment often the Prosecution will go and re-interview witnesses, and sometimes prior to trial, paragraphs are withdrawn -- as they were done in respect of this Accused's indictment.  I'm simply raising the issue that this -- an indictment is a prima facie; that's why we have people coming before Your Honours for Your Honours to assess their evidence.  It does not seem appropriate, with respect, for an Accused to start commenting on another indictment in a vacuum.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maître Cantier.  
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, I was talking about censorship earlier on, but now it is complete censorship.  Besides the Prosecutor -- after having telling you what I could not have admitted into evidence, is now telling me what I should have admitted into evidence.  

Up to now, I never requested any advice from the Office of the Prosecution, and I wish to inform the Prosecutor that the lengthy explanations that have not led to any objection -- but, that is the rule of the game.  If you are on your feet, it is normally to raise an objection -- are in such a way of explaining -- of explaining your embarrassment, since in two indictments concerning two people who are supposedly part of a conspiracy, you have provided different names and different dates regarding the victims.  

I'm not going to give you my opinion on that, but I need to take note of it.  And, for the time being -- and I am in charge of Mr. Renzaho's defence, I am only referring to the indictment.  
The Trial Chamber heard that the documents had been disclosed to me on Monday.  
The Trial Chamber knows where I am since Monday, and the Trial Chamber can imagine how easy it will be to deal with such documents.  I am going to focus on the indictment.  I am not going to make 
use -- because I did not have sufficient time to do so and I do not wish to do so -- I am not, as I was saying, going to use the other documents which were disclosed to me somewhat reluctantly.  

So, if I may, my learned colleague, let me continue with the examination of Mr. Renzaho.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have now noted the observations of both parties, and look forward to the next question.  
MR. CANTIER:
Let me set aside this subject, Mr. President, Your Honours, regarding the charges brought against Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka, and my following question to Mr. Renzaho is: 
BY MR. CANTIER: 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, did you ever hear or receive any complaint regarding rapes that were allegedly committed at Sainte Famille and, more generally, in the town of Kigali? 
A.	No, Counsel, I never heard such complaints.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, were you informed of any such acts which, according to a witness who testified before this Trial Chamber, were perpetrated by a member of the communal administration? 
A.	Counsel, on this matter let me tell you that I did not receive any complaint, and I was not given any information on the matter, if you are referring to the Biryogo secteur.  But if I may say a few words on the issue, and I wish to refer once again to the case of the orphanage of the Calcutta charity sisters.  

You have heard the victim who stated that the event took place three or four days after the 7th, the 7th being the date on which that person went to the Calcutta orphanage.  And she claims that I arrived with Interahamwe, and that I chased the refugees who were there.  And regarding the women, injurious words have been used to describe my actions.  

Your Honours, let me state that on the 10th -- or, even the 11th, I had a specific schedule and I could not have been in two places at the same time, as I have been able to demonstrate before this 
Trial Chamber.  

So, if I take the example of the evidence provided here in order to prove that a crime was committed, I believe this is something that has been arranged, and I do not believe in it at all -- and there are many such arrangements.  I do not have sufficient time to refer to all of them, but there were many such arrangements.  Thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, let me put to you a specific question on the Calcutta sister's orphanage, but you -- I -- I wanted to put a question to you on this orphanage, but you answered before I put the question to you.  
Mr. Renzaho, are you aware of the circumstances under which the journalist Kameya disappeared? 
A.	I was not informed of such circumstances, Counsel. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, even if you have already referred to the matter, could you tell us more specifically, what were your links with the conseiller, Odette, and the education inspector, Angeline? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The journalist just referred to, was that number 209, the journalist? 
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, indeed, Mr. President, number 209. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

And now the answer, Mr. Renzaho? 
THE WITNESS:
I did not have any special links with these two communal staff members.  Why would I have specific links with them since there were 19 conseillers in the préfecture of Kigali town?  

It is only upon reading the indictment when I arrived here that I noted that it was written in my indictment.  I did not have any specific or special link with these two staff members.  

Mukandituye, Angeline, was a primary education inspector, so that, in fact, she worked for the ministry of primary and secondary education, working in the Nyarugenge commune.  So she should have been directly under the responsibility of that commune.  

The other person was the conseiller of the Rugenge secteur; she was a conseiller.  The commune is governed by the law of the 23rd of November of 1963.  I was never demoted to the rank of 
conseiller de secteur.  I thank you.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, did you on the 9th or the 10th of April -- we did not know precisely the date as given by the Prosecution witness who referred to this -- so did you go to Kanombe in the company of Interahamwe in order to attack the -- to attack Tutsis in the Akajagali business centre or trading centre? 
A.	Thank you for your question, Counsel.  No, my answer is no.  During the afternoon of the 9th of April of 1994, my family joined me coming from Kanombe.  So, what I did was that I went to have my family settle in at the Kiyovu hotel and I took care of practical problems.  I do not see how I could have gone to Kanombe in order to terrorise or to kill Tutsi families in that commune.  And besides, it is true that I'm here before you as an accused person; that is true.  But, frankly speaking, my heart is not made of stone and even when you put fire on the stone, the stone will melt.  How could one imagine such a thing, when at the same time I was sheltering refugees at my place of residence?  How could one imagine that on that specific date I sent Brigadier Ayabagabo in order for him to organise the protection of the refugees who were staying at my place of residence.  What I'm telling you is the truth.  I thank you.  
MR. CANTIER:
Brigadier Ayabagabo is number 21 on the spelling list.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says counsel.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, what became of this brigadier? 
A.	From the -- on the basis of the information -- the latest information I received on that person, he has allegedly died, and I am not aware of the circumstances of his death.  I thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, you are also charged with having instigated and having participated in an attack on the house of Elie, a FAR soldier in Nyarugenge on the 28th of April of 1994.  What do you have to say in the face of such a charge brought against you? 
A.	Counsel, I thank you.  I never went to Munyankindi's house and I don't even know where he resides.  I did not give any order to anyone to go and kill the people who were at Munyankindi's, let alone head any attack against his residence.  And you did specify that he was a soldier.  Why did he not come to see me?  Did I have any intentions against him?  I don't know.  

We lived through very difficult times and to make one person responsible for all such events is not true.  The situations I was faced with on a daily basis led to the deaths of human beings, and those were conditions that were difficult to bear in a normal society.  This was what we were faced with on a daily basis.  

But it is with great sorrow that I say that one cannot imagine I could have any control on such actions, or even imagine that I could have participated in any killing when the situation was brought about by the sequence of events at the time.  We did our best in order to prevent such actions being -- taking place.  

I am craving for your indulgence.  Perhaps I was not able to do anything in the face of such a situation, I acknowledge that.  Thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, did you go to the roadblock that was set up next to the Hotel Kiyovu in the company of Mr. Bagosora, Setako, and Nsengiyumva, on the 14th of June of 1994? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And before the answer, Elie Munyankindi was number 325.  

Now, the answer, please? 
THE WITNESS:
I did not go to the roadblock next to the Kiyovu hotel on the 14th of June of 1994.  Those who know me know that I'm not an adventurer.  In view of the situation that prevailed at the time, I could not have gone to the Kiyovu hotel.  Opposite on the Mburabuturo hill, on which the national -- the Rwandan national university building was, the RPF had settled.  That hill is at a distance of 700 metres from the Kiyovu hotel as the crow flies, and all their weapons were pointing at the Kiyovu hotel. 

It would have been strange for authorities to go to this roadblock, which, in fact, is an imaginary one -- especially since the Kiyovu hotel was empty since July of 1994.  The refugees who were there, as I stated before this Trial Chamber, were taken and grouped at the Mille Collines hotel where they could enjoy better protection.  

So, I received officers at the Kiyovu -- I would not have received any officers at the Kiyovu hotel, which was a place that had been deserted by everybody.  What for?  Let me tell you that this -- what I'm saying can be corroborated by other people.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This hill that you just referred, we have two versions.  Could you just spell the name of it, please? 
THE WITNESS:
Mburabuturo, it is M-B-U-R-A-B-U-T-U-R-O, Mburabuturo.  Mburabuturo.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Renzaho, the Kiyovu hotel -- you had referred to it, since you told us that you had housed your family there? 
A.	That is true, my family stayed there and left that hotel on the 12th of April of 1994.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, were you aware of the existence of a document which was admitted into evidence in another trial, and which refers to a person who was allegedly with you on that day, and that person being Mr. Bagosora -- and as well as a photocopy of his passport? 
A.	Yes.  
MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, I don't think it will come as any surprise that I'm objecting to Mr. Bagosora's passport of which I am aware there was considerable argument and debate in another trial that some of 
Your Honours are aware of as to his movements, and it is simply inappropriate in my submission.  
And it falls within 92 bis.  

If they wanted to call Mr. Bagosora to give evidence about his movements, they could choose to do so, and they have not done so.  So, I am objecting to any introduction or reference to Mr. Bagosora's passport.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But why would a document, a passport amount to a declaration falling under 92 bis?  
MR. MOSES:
Because it, I believe, will be used to try and contradict the Prosecution witness who says that 
Colonel Bagosora was present at Hotel Kiyovu on the 14th; that's the purpose as I understand it.  I believe it has an exit stamp, but no entry stamp.  

And I have read some of the transcripts from the trial involved, and there was considerable debate about the comings and goings of Colonel Bagosora, and whether there were -- all the entries were recorded on the one document, whether they were all recorded.  That's the -- it's -- it's a backdoor way, once again, to try and contradict a Prosecution witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maître Cantier. 
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, what I feared is that I fall under Rule 92 bis; it is a strict regime.  This is a document which we have been able to recover, and I believe the onus is on the Trial Chamber to assess its relevance.  

Because if we were to follow your line of reasoning, any documentary evidence is indirectly some sort of testimony, Counsel for the Prosecution.  And what I'm saying right now is also valid for some of the evidence I used earlier on -- at least, some of them, because, Counsel for the Prosecution, a document is always written by someone.  It's always the result of somebody's work.  And as a consequence, if the Trial Chamber was to rule in your favour, it would mean that it would be impossible to have admitted any documentary evidence, because any document is the fruit of a human being's work.  

We are dealing with this specific document right now.  I believe the Trial Chamber will assess its relevance.  We shall discuss, my learned friend, on your famous witness who had come wearing some head gear.  We're all aware of this witness.  Mr. Renzaho -- it's his right, and I wish to have this document tendered into evidence here.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is now 5:03.  Could you just give us an indication as to where you are in your examination-in-chief, Maître Cantier, how much is left once you have a ruling on this issue? 
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I believe I have between 20 minutes and 30 minutes left, if there are not too many obstacles in my way.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Maître Cantier, this passport, where do we find it?  Is it in the fourth list? 
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, it can be found in volume 1, tab 24 -- and besides, it bears the references of 
Mr. Bagosora's trial.  I believe it was admitted into evidence through him, since his name appears as a witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And do you want the entire passport admitted or some particular page with a stamp?  I suppose it's useful to have it in context, is that your point?  Which page do you want us to focus on at any rate?  I realise that there is no enumeration here, no page number, but maybe you could just count.  I see that the passport itself has page numbers, and on each sheet we find two pages of the passport.  Where do you want us to look? 
MR. CANTIER:
That is correct, Mr. President, page 17 -- but, especially page 18, the entry to Seychelles on the 
4th of June 1974 (sic) and the exit on the 19th of June 1994.  Because there is a page somewhere, it is page 19, quite precisely.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
18, 18, I'm sorry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you just repeat the dates? 
MR. CANTIER:
On page 18 of the passport, the Trial Chamber will note that there's an entry visa to Seychelles, dated 
4 June 1994.  And there's an exit visa from the Seychelles airport on 19th of June 1994.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

We will reflect and provide the required clarity tomorrow morning at 8:45.  And then we will hear the rest of the examination-in-chief, take note of the list of Defence exhibits, which should kindly be distributed to all of us before we make a decision on the tendering of these documents, and then we will start with the cross-examination.  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, that list will be very brief.  It's ready, we have filled it out bit by bit, but I didn't understand what you were saying.  When do you want us to put it in, Mr. President? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
When you have made it ready.  
MR. CANTIER:
Well, because when I finish -- conclude my examination-in-chief, we'll only need a few minutes to add the last document, so it will be done quite soon after I've concluded my cross-examination, because we have been listing them bit by bit as we proceed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that is, indeed, the ideal solution so we are very pleased that can be done, thank you.  

The Court is then adjourned until tomorrow morning.  
(Court adjourned at 1709H)
