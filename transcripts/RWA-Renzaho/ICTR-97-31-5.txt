P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is, then, the opening of the trial.  

Prosecution, you have the floor for the opening statement 
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honours.  

May it please Your Honours, the préfecture of Kigali-ville was created in May 1990.  This was a new préfecture, the most important préfecture in Rwanda, the heart of the country, the capital city.  

Who was chosen by the president, Juvénal Habyarimana, as the very first préfet of Kigali-ville?  Someone with experience in administration at préfecture level?  No.  It was the Accused, 
Tharcisse Renzaho, who was chosen to take on this new role.  And he was a soldier, lieutenant colonel at the time, not an administrator.  This was no chance decision.  The defendant was chosen because he was a hard man of military background, whom the president could rely on to achieve the aims of the government in the capital.  And his appointment was well timed.  Renzaho became préfet by presidential decree on 5 October 1990, just as the RPF invasion of Rwanda began.  

From the government's point of view, the appointment of Renzaho proved a shrewd choice.  Immediately after he took office, a massive roundup of Tutsi so-called infiltrators took place in the capital.  Renzaho oversaw this and their subsequent imprisonment, without charge, for a considerable period before international pressure forced the release of many of them.  

This was just a taste of what was to come, for over the following years, Renzaho assisted in the preparation of the genocide, both as a public official and a private individual.  He allowed one of his homes to become a base for the Interahamwe -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you slow down a little bit, please. 

Thank you. 
MR. MOSES:
He allowed one of his own homes to become a base for the Interahamwe to meet prior to training in secret because, with the advent of the multiparty system in 1991, there was a prohibition on party militia.  And he, himself, recruited Interahamwe from among youths at the school.  Weapons were amassed at the préfecture office, and, just before the 6th of April 1994, Renzaho, in collusion with the minister of defence, drew up a list of civilians for recruitment for what was called the civil defence programme, something which the Prosecution will show was nothing but a ruse for providing training and arms to hardline civilians to assist in a programme of genocide.  

So what was the Accused's role after the 6th of April 1994?  As préfet, he was the officer of the authority of the state and the representative of the government in Kigali-ville.  One of the key duties of the préfet was to ensure peace and public order and the security of all citizens, as well as their property, within his préfecture.  Renzaho did none of these things.  Instead, he participated in the massacre of Tutsi citizens and the looting and destruction of their property over the following months.  

There can be no question that a war was going on and that this war was taking place in Kigali, as elsewhere in Rwanda.  But this cannot justify the killing or causing of harm to innocent Tutsi in government-occupied areas of the city, which is exactly what happened over the hundred days following the shooting down of the president's plane.  

The Prosecution will show that, in these government-controlled areas, the authority of Renzaho did not diminish after April the 6th.  Indeed, after the 12th of April when the interim government moved away from Kigali to Gitarama, Renzaho was left in charge of the capital.  He remained there as the most senior government official until early July.  

Rwanda in 1994 had a very well-structured administrative system, which connected the individual citizen to the government by a tightly knit chain of officials, from ten cell leaders up to the préfet and from him to the minister of the interior.  After April 6th Renzaho continued to command this structure, dismissing those below him who were either Tutsi or moderates.  He did nothing to investigate or punish the murderers of three Tutsi conseillers who were killed on 7 April.  Renzaho himself dismissed the conseiller of Kicukiro and replaced him with an extremist.  He replaced a conseiller with a notorious Interahamwe.  He dismissed another for allegedly protecting Tutsi and providing them with food.  

The préfet of Kigali-ville had at least 200 policemen under his direct control, as well as a network of administrative officials, whose responsibility was to arrest those committing crimes.  Renzaho was also able to requisition the gendarmerie at a critical time just such as this.  Yet instead of using this power to stop the deliberate targeting of the Tutsi civilian population, Renzaho used these forces under his control as a means to -- Renzaho used these forces under his control as a means to his very end.

The Prosecution will show that when, for example, a notorious killer of Tutsi was brought before him for punishment, Renzaho instead rewarded the killer with petrol coupons.  Although not officially under his control, the Prosecution will call evidence to show that the Interahamwe in Kigali-ville answered to Renzaho.  Because, like almost everyone else in the city, they viewed the préfet with the greatest respect and as the most senior of authority figures.  If Renzaho ordered them to stop killing, they would have done so.  

More than one Prosecution witness will testify that, on seeing the préfet when under attack, they wrongly believed that they were being saved because of the enormous power they knew Renzaho to wield.  Yet time and time again, he let them down.  By April 1994, Renzaho had been promoted to the rank of colonel in the Rwandan army.  By virtue of this rank, as well as his civilian position as préfet, Renzaho also commanded respect and obedience from soldiers and, in particular, from the gendarmes whom he requisitioned.  

The préfecture office of Kigali-ville became one of the centres of the genocidal operations within the city after April 6th.  It was from here that many weapons and ammunition were distributed.  It was here that senior government, political, and military figures, such as Joseph Nzirorera, Laurent Semanza, and Gratien Kabiligi, as well as Interahamwe leaders such as Robert Kajuga and George Rutaganda, met.  It was from the préfecture office that the means of free movement were obtained.  Laissez-passers were issued by the préfet and allowed free travel through roadblocks, both inside and outside the capital city.  Having requisitioned the city's fuel supplies, petrol coupons were distributed by the préfet too.  

The Prosecution makes specific allegations about the Accused's actions after the 6th of April 1994.  The Prosecution will show that the Accused oversaw the construction and manning of roadblocks throughout the city.  Ostensibly these roadblocks were to prevent RPF infiltrators entering or moving about the city, but, in practice, they were used to stop, identify, and kill Tutsi.  Renzaho was certainly well aware that Tutsi were being targeted and killed at roadblocks throughout Kigali-ville, but he took no steps, or no meaningful steps, to stop these acts of genocide.  

Indeed, Renzaho himself encouraged the people manning roadblocks to kill Tutsi, urging greater vigilance and ordering the killers to work harder.  The word "work" was a well-known euphemism for the killing of Tutsi.  

The Accused distributed weapons and ammunition, not to responsible citizens for the defence of the city, but to Interahamwe and civilians manning roadblocks and to those civilians singled out as hardliners who could assist the genocidal cause under the guise of the civil defence programme.  

After 6th April many Tutsis sought refuge at religious centres.  The Prosecution specifically accuses Renzaho of ordering the killing of Tutsi at the Centre d'Education de Langues Africaines, known as CELA, C-E-L-A, St. Paul's Centre, and St. Famille church, three such sites in the heart of the city and in proximity to each other.  It was at CELA that on about the 22nd of April 1994, after gathering together Interahamwe at their headquarters and providing them with weapons, Renzaho led militia to -- into the centre and oversaw the separation of about 60 Tutsi men.  Some of these, who knew him from happier times, begged to be spared.  Renzaho would not listen to these pleas, and the men were taken away.  One witness will testify to having been amongst those selected.  He will describe how the men were lined up on a mound and shot.  The bodies of the victims were buried in a notorious mass grave, some of them when still alive.  

Around 1500 people sought refuge at St. Paul's.  Interahamwe went there regularly with lists of people they wished to remove.  Many people were killed as a result of these visits by Interahamwe.  Many times the priests in charge of the centre called the préfecture office for help.  None was forthcoming.  On one occasion, Renzaho was telephoned and asked to intervene to prevent the killing of the refugees.  Renzaho's response was simply, in French, "(French spoken)."  

On about -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which means in English, for the record -- 
MR. MOSES:
Perhaps we will get the interpreters -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- "I don't care." 
MR. MOSES:
"I don't care." 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. MOSES:
On about 14 June, a very large number of Interahamwe went to St. Paul's.  The priests once again called the préfecture office for help.  Renzaho did go to St. Paul's, where he greeted Interahamwe but did nothing to prevent the removing of about 60 Tutsi on the basis of a list of names bearing the stamp of the préfecture office itself.  These Tutsi were tied together, led away, and killed.  

During the night of the 16th and 17th of June 1994, a large number of these surviving Tutsi refugees at St. Paul's were rescued by the RPF.  It is the Prosecution case that this angered Renzaho so much that he ordered a revenge attack on the Tutsi civilians who were still at St. Famille.  At the parish there were perhaps 5,000 refugees.  

On the 17th of June, Renzaho went to St. Famille, whilst Interahamwe and soldiers surrounded the refugees and opened fire on them.  Renzaho ordered this attack.  And when a very large number of Tutsi had been killed, he ordered the militia to stop.  They obeyed him, thus evidencing again the authority of the Accused and his ability to prevent the massacre of Tutsi, had he wanted to.  

Tutsi men were not the only targets of the genocidal campaign in Kigali-ville.  The Prosecution will call evidence to show that the rape of women was widespread from after 6th April.  The Prosecution accuses Renzaho not only of responsibility for failing to prevent or punish acts of rape but of actively encouraging and supporting them.  

Renzaho described Tutsi woman as food for the soldiers, telling militia to spare them for that purpose.  The administrative officials beneath him reported regularly of incidents of rape in their areas, yet he did nothing to investigate, let alone punish, those responsible because the rape of Tutsi women was an inherent part of the genocide against this group.  

During the genocide, Renzaho was clearly aware of the international focus on Kigali-ville, which was the capital.  He made several statements to the effect that those taking part in the killings should be careful not to attract the attention of the international community, and the press in particular.  He ordered the clearing of bodies from the streets and their burial in mass graves so that they would not be photographed by foreigners.  He spoke on the radio regularly, giving mixed messages, but it was clear to those around him that anything Renzaho said which might be interpreted favourably was simply a front put on for the international community.  And the actions and inactions of the Accused revealed his true intentions. 

Your Honours, with the office of the préfet, which was granted to the Accused on 5 October 1990, came a great deal of responsibility.  Renzaho was given charge of the people of the city of Kigali, both Hutu and Tutsi alike.  It was his duty to take care of them, to maintain peace and public order, and to ensure their safety and security.  He was given the means to do so, in his network of administrative officials, his police, and the gendarmerie.  Had he wished to, after April the 6th, 1994, he could have helped his Tutsi citizens.  He could have brought order.  He could have made arrest (sic).  He could have ensured the security of refugee centres.  Instead, he betrayed that part of the people -- his people who were most vulnerable, and he did so with genocidal intent.  

The Accused is now being held to account for his actions and faces six separate counts in the indictment:  Genocide, including acts of rape, both for his individual acts and for those as a superior; alternatively, complicity in genocide; murder as a crime against humanity for his individual acts and as a superior; rape as a crime against humanity as a superior; murder as a war crime, both for his individual acts and as a superior; and, finally, rape as a war crime as a superior.  
The Prosecutor has the burden of proving these charges beyond a reasonable doubt.  To do so, we will call a range of witnesses to prove the case against the Accused.  Some are victims, some are co-perpetrators, some are neither.  These witnesses come from a variety of ethnic groups and differing social and educational backgrounds.  What they all have in common, however, Your Honours, is their evidence against the Accused, which the Prosecutor says will satisfy Your Honours as to the guilt of Tharcisse Renzaho in respect of the crimes for which he has been charged.

Please, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Unless there is anything else to be said, Defence counsel?  
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, Your Honours.  

The Defence would like to say a few words as the trial is beginning.  We have a few things to say regarding the trial itself, with your leave.  

Thank you, Mr. President.  Yes, the Defence deemed it necessary at this stage to remind all of the importance of international justice, a decisive instrument in the fight against impunity and (unintelligible) of progress -- the rule of law and the (unintelligible).  It underscores the essential nature of the decisions which this Tribunal has to render towards fostering the basic values of mankind and for purposes of history.  And for us, the players of this justice system, who, Mr. President, Your Honours, come like you all here with our own personal backgrounds and which is usually characterised by militancy in the area of human rights.  

We consider this justice as one which should be exemplary and which has to scrupulously uphold the principles which are the bases and the justification:  Firstly, that of a fair trial.  If the proceedings before this Tribunal and that is the extraordinary contribution of this new international justice are individual, they concern people involved and implicated in a conflict which pitted them against another camp.  The fact that this Tribunal, for the moment, is judging on the -- the suspects of one of the belligerents, whereas it is known that crimes were committed by the other belligerents, with undoubtedly the fair nature of proceedings -- when we look at the Renzaho case, for instance, the Court just heard the significance of the charges against him -- or, rather, the accusations.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, we all know that Mr. Renzaho has pleaded not guilty.  In our matter, there were dangerous mistakes, which, if confirmed, would prevent Mr. Renzaho from enjoying a fair trial.  It is common knowledge that Mr. Renzaho, for many people who listened to Rwandan and international stations, it is known that Mr. Renzaho has been and remains a strong opponent of the Rwandan regime. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, nobody in this world is unaware of the strict and severe control that the power in Kigali is putting on Rwandan population.  And we know that they use such judicial and parajudicial institutions like the Gacaca; major international organisations, like Amnesty International, relay such issues.  And in this condition, I am thinking about a report recently prepared by that institution.  Accordingly -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Maître.  This worked very well.  Could I just now ask you to slow down a little bit.  

Thank you.

	1015H
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I am making efforts to speak slowly and distinctly but sometimes I fail, so I will see.  

The Defence is against the peculiar backdrop of Rwanda as it stands now, how the freedom of speech of those living in Rwanda and who come to testify here will be upheld.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, this question takes its very importance in this present case.  This is the reason why I'm raising it, because I submit that several of the witnesses who we met and who were ready to come and testify before your Court in favor of Mr. Renzaho have now refused to do so.  And this goes to the point of refusing any contact, whatsoever, with the Defence teams.  Insofar as the witnesses we meet do not believe in the effectiveness of the protective measures taken by the Tribunal, especially by its Kigali branch, which is permanently monitored by the officials of the country who are fully aware of all work is going on and what is being said there.  It is the former Prosecutor of the Tribunal publicly acknowledged that when she was at the helm of the Prosecution office our telephone conversations were systematically monitored by Rwandan authorities.  The recent developments from France and the threats lingering on the heads of certain Rwandan officials have further worsened the situation of the Defence, two of which members, on account of their nationality, have been declared persona non grata in Rwanda.  

If, as Mr. Cruvelier, someone who knows your Tribunal very well, stated, is justice should (unintelligible) that of the vanquished because for knowledge of the international community, at least, it must preserve its basic principles, which are very valuable for today and tomorrow for purposes of posterity and progress of mankind and, in this connection, I'm referring to the United Nations Security Council, which set up this Tribunal, and which tells you, Mr. President, that the trials have to end at the earliest possibility.  Yes, there is an emergency situation, but we have loved that Security Council to make haste at that time when Rwandans were being massacred.  

Now, let me move slowly, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the name you just referred to was spelled C-R-U-V-E-L-I-E-R.  Please proceed.
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Mr. President.  I think I was not mistaken when I mentioned Mr. Cruvelier.  C-R-U-V-E-L-I-E-R, is the one who authored the book on your Tribunal titled The Tribunal --
MR. PRESIDENT:
I just wanted the spelling correct.  Just proceed.  Thank you so much.
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, sir.  I was referring to the pressures which are coming now from the Security Council to this tribunal to end its mandate as soon as possible.  We are here to participate in this justice system and you can also count on our cooperation, insofar as we consider that a fair nature of the trial is not fundamentally undermined.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, we are not employees of the justice, let alone mercenaries.  We are citizens who exercise our activities and each and every one of us are fully aware of the indispensable nature of this task.  But the performance of our mission, particularly here, is limited when we are unable to fully discharge our duties.  If we realise that this trial, for the reasons I just mentioned, is undermined in the area of fairness, then the Defence will draw (unintelligible) consequences and we will request the Tribunal to do so.  Thank you, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Before calling the investigator, I noted that there was a reference to a possible judgement pertaining to Witness UL in Defence counsel's observations during the pre-trial conference.  Does the Prosecution have any comment on that?  
MR. MOSES:
Yes, I do, because UL was not one of the detainees.  UL was tried and acquitted, so there is -- I had forgotten there is a judgement in relation to UL, but he was found not guilty.  So, in terms of using it to read information to impeach the witness's credibility, it is not quite the same, with due respect, than to those judgements where a witness has been convicted.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But there is such a judgement and it exists in Kinyarwanda only?  
MR. MOSES:
Yes, I think it's three or four, maybe six pages.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is relatively brief.  Thank you.  And then you implicitly asked about the schedule for next week.  The present scenario is that we will have a slot of the Military trial from Monday the 15th, but we will come back to you if there are any changes.  So far there is no reason to believe that there will be any changes.  In other words, we will proceed with Military I next week.  

Exactly the way how to organise the time will be assessed a bit later this week.  

Are we ready for the investigator?  
MR. MOSES:
Yes, we are, sir, if I could have Rajesh Neupane called.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Registry please?  Are there any documents to be distributed in connection with this investigator?  
MR. MOSES:
There are, Your Honour.  I don't know whether you want to do that before or after.  I was going to take a few minutes to explain how I intend to proceed, whether we want to do that now in the absence of the investigator.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is up to you, but if we could have the documents in front of us when you explain how to proceed, that would facilitate matters.  

So, if the registry could get in touch with the Prosecution to make sure we get these documents immediately, please, and then these documents could be distributed while we are swearing the witness in.

Is there a personal information sheet for this witness?  
MR. MOSES:
There is not, Your Honour, because he is not a protected witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But that doesn't matter.  Anyhow, the spelling, the date of his birth all these particulars should be on paper.  It saves time.
MR. MOSES:
I didn't realise they had done one, Your Honour.  There is one.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are Rajesh Neupane.  What is your year of birth, please?  Can we have your birth date?  It is not marked on the paper.
THE WITNESS:
20 October 1950.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And your place of birth?  
THE WITNESS:
Nepal, Bsopur district, B-S-O-P-U-R.  It's in Nepal.
MR. PRESIDENT:
B-H-O-P-A-L, that's what you just said.
THE WITNESS:
B-S-O-P-U-R, Bsopur.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, we have it.  This document will then be with my additional markings distributed to the parties.  

Mr. Witness, you have to tell the truth.  The registry will now take your solemn declaration.
(Declaration made by Rajesh Neupane in English)
MR. PRESIDENT:
The registry will give this to you to sign it and this will be the first document from the Prosecution.  

Is that all right with the Prosecution?  
MR. MOSES:
It is, Your Honour, and if I can, just before I start the evidence-in-chief, Your Honours, we distributed these documents to the Defence, I think the date of the status conference in December.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The two binders?  
MR. MOSES:
I think they have been divided in three binders, but they are the same documents we have in front of us as two.  Your Honours will see there is a schedule at the commencement of each binder, particular of exhibit folder number 1.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the judges have two binders but the Defence may have received it in three binders?  
MR. MOSES:
Yes, but they are the same documents.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. MOSES:
Now, Your Honour, we've prepared this to try and save time and also so that everyone is working from the same map, as it were, the same bundle.  I've spoken to the Defence.  At this stage they haven't indicated if there are any documents which they are opposing, objecting to, but they have requested that we go through them one by one and they will make a decision in respect of each of those documents.  I had initially intended to, hopefully by consent, hand them to Your Honours.  That was my initial proposal, but that's obviously the Defence prerogative and their right and that being the case, I will go through them one by one.  It may be that there is an objection in respect of any particular document and if Your Honour rules in the Defence's favour then it would be my suggestion that Your Honours and -- we will remove the document simply from behind the tab.  I can arrange for new Prosecution exhibit numbers, which we have given in the left-hand column as a proposed Prosecution exhibit number.  We'll have to do that anyway now that the official information sheet is P. 1 and that I can amend -- we will simply leave the tab empty if the document is not admitted and we will provide Your Honours and the Defence with an updated schedule of documents so that everyone is dealing with exactly the same document.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
From the booth, Mr. President, the interpreters don't have any documents.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have a spare copy for the interpreters?  
MR. MOSES:
No, we don't, Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, then we will make sure that there is no lack of clarity when we approach the individual documents, but if such documentation could be made available when you have that possibility it would be helpful, because these are documents you will come back to during the trial and the interpreters should certainly have it in their files.
MR. MOSES:
Very well, Your Honour, in respect of that, also, can I distribute -- what we've done is a list of names for Your Honours and the Defence and we have copies for the interpreters.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the court reporters?  
MR. MOSES:
We may or may not have sufficient copies at this stage, but I can easily -- it will be more relevant when the witness is testifying.  I'll arrange at lunchtime.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just hold on for a moment, please.

Have the court reporters received the spelling list?  One set has been distributed.
MR. MOSES:
I'll arrange for extra copies, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You were just about to say something, Mr. Moses.
MR. MOSES:
I was just going to say I will arrange for additional copies, and I don't believe the list is, in fact, particularly relevant where this witness's testimony is concerned, and should there be additional names that are going to be referred to by witnesses which are not in that master list, we will, at the commencement of those witness's testimony, distribute a copy of such names.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that's helpful.  We can then update this document which presently has 209 names, as the case moves on, and then you can simply refer to the number when you get to it, when there is a need.  

What's your next point, now, Counsel?  
MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, I intend to proceed, as per the list of exhibits that are in the schedule commencement of the folders and I will now introduce them one by one.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have all these documents been assembled or compiled by this witness?  With other words, he is in a position to comment on each and everyone of them?  
MR. MOSES:
In some way or another, yes, they come from the database, Your Honour.  He will not have necessarily personal knowledge, but they are from the OTP database.
MR. PRESIDENT:
How many documents are there where there is really a possibility that there will be an objection, because there is no need, in abstract, to go through two huge binders if, at the end of the day, it's not subject to dispute?  Do you have an indication of the Defence position, Prosecution.  Then we will hear the Defence afterwards to see if we can gain some time, because we are interested here in the testimony of this witness and not simply a presentation of documents, which is very time consuming.
MR. MOSES:
Absolutely, that was the purpose of putting them in the folders, as we have done it, but I spoke to the Defence yesterday.  They indicated that they would know this morning what documents -- I think that was the indication I don't want to misstate it.  It was my recollection they would be in a position this morning to indicate which documents they had issue with.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Defence, could you kindly enlighten us now on the most updated position?  Let us start with volume one called "schedule of documents excluding radio transcripts."  That is from P. 1 to P. 63.
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Mr. President, Judges.  Mr. President, the Defence position was clearly made known to my learned friend yesterday concerning the documents.  I would like to draw the Chamber's attention to the list of documents.  There are maps of Kigali town, each body has been disclosed to us, so the Defence finds that the disclosure be made.  That aside, Mr. President, Your Honours, we clearly made known to our learned friends that all the exhibits that those documents, though bulky, cannot be the subject of a comprehensive tendering process without the Defence having the opportunity to discuss the documents with the witness here.  And the fact that you just put the question to the Prosecutor -- you just put the question to the Prosecutor whether the documents were all compiled by this witness and you got an answer.  That was, in fact, the concern of the Defence, Mr. President, Your Honours.  And we think that at this stage we cannot say that we admit this or that item of the document disclosed by the Prosecutor.  We would like that each of the documents provided by the Prosecutor be discussed and the relevance made known before the document is put in.  That is our position, Mr. President, Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If there is nothing else to be said, I think we simply have to start and see how this develops.  I assume that even if you have this list of P. 1.  That can easily be changed, so would you be willing to ask for the present information sheet of this investigator being admitted as P. 1?  
MR. MOSES:
Absolutely, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So that is, Mr. Mussa, will you please note that.
MR. MUSSA:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
(Exhibit No P. 1 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's start.
RAJESH NEUPANE, 
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows: 
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, can you please give the Trial Chamber your present occupation? 
A.	Sitting or -- 
Q.	Yes.  
A.	I'm team leader/investigator in ICTR at present. 
Q.	And amongst the files which you are responsible for, do you have responsibility for the Renzaho case? 
A.	Yes, we have the files, the papers which these folders contain that I have personally required from the different databases and from the Rwandan government offices. 
Q.	How long have you been working for the ICTR? 
A.	I joined ICTR on 20th October.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, if there will be a gap between the question and the answer, Mr. President, that will help interpretation.  Thank you.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you hear that?  There is a need for a pause between the question and answer to allow for the interpretation and, in addition to that, if you can speak a bit more slowly that will help a bit better for the transcription.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We noted that you joined ICTR on the 20th of October and now which year, please?  
THE WITNESS:
1995.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And prior to the Tribunal, what was your occupation? 
A.	I was a senior police officer in Nepal police force and I was responsible for the investigation, administration of the Nepal police, where I lived, and sometime I worked under the headquarter of other offices, too. 
Q.	When did you join the Nepal police, please? 
A.	I joined the Nepal police in -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, once more for the interpreters.
MR. PRESIDENT:
There are only two requests.  They are very simple, because, one, pause, request two, speed.  Could you both try to live up to those expectations?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, sir, I will do it. 

I joined Nepal police force in 1974.
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Very well.  And where are you currently residing, in terms of which country, which city? 
A.	At present I am an officer of the Rwandan Tribunal.  I am living in Rwanda, Kigali.
MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, I'm wondering if the registry could assist by having the first map shown to the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I suppose that --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I suppose it is well and good that the witness sees the huge map but couldn't you place it on some kind of equipment there and then the Court video system could zoom in on the map and then the witness can comment on the map and we can all see it?  So could that be done, please?  

Please sit down, Mr. Witness.  

Court video system, on the top there, as always.  If necessary, on the cupboard, not that way, up so that we can see it, please.  

Prosecution, can you assist?  Exactly.  Court video system, Mr. Tredici, can you make sure it doesn't fall down?  

Court system, zoom in, please.  

All right, first question.
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness is that a map of Kigali, in fact, a Rwandan military street plan from 1994? 
A.	Yeah, this is a military street plan prepared in 1994 and we retrieved it from the Rwandan authorities, and we can easily get these maps from the offices.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, in other words, the answer to the question was?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And does the map show the various secteurs of Kigali-ville as of 1994? 
A.	Yes, all the secteurs we can see on this map. 
Q.	And a general question, in relation to the map, you are able to point out to Their Honours where the city centre, the area of the map which shows the commercial business district? 
A.	Sir, I can point out all the -- 
Q.	Well, perhaps -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
In order to do this, if you could kindly leave the place where you are sitting, move over there and point it out to us, please.  Make sure that you speak into the microphone which has to be switched on next to the map.
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, with your leave, I would like to indicate that we have no objection to the tendering of this map and, therefore, it is not necessary to go into any details about the contents of the map.  We would not object to it being tendered into evidence.  We will gain time by proceeding in this manner.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  That was a very helpful remark.  With that in mind, is there any element that you would wish the Bench to be appraised of on this map before it is being tendered, Mr. Moses?  
MR. MOSES:
Just one, Your Honour.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Can you point out the general area where St. Famille church is on that map? 
A.	Yes, I can point out.  This is the main roundabout in the Kigali city, on the right-hand in this area are all the four religious institutions are (unintelligible).
MR. MOSES:
Very well, and, for the record, the witness indicated a roundabout on the left-hand side.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it's well hidden behind the microphone.  You see, the way we usually proceed is that the microphone is placed on the right-hand side of the map and then you can point out standing on the right-hand side of the map instead of blocking the view from the Court video system by standing on the left side.  So, Mr. Witness, could you now kindly -- all right, you've arranged it so far.  Let's proceed then.
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Does the map mark St. Famille church? 
A.	Here this is the St. Famille point. 
Q.	All right, now, perhaps in release to St. Famille there has been mention of a --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, don't breathe into the microphone.  

The question?  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	There has been reference to a place called CELA, are you familiar with that institution in relation to St. Famille? 
A.	Yes, CELA is this one institution compound that is simple centre and then after is CELA.
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Without putting words in your mouth, is St. Paul adjacent to St. Famille and is CELA adjacent to St. Paul?
A.	Yes.
MR. MOSES:
I now ask that map be tendered as Prosecution Exhibit 2.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Mussa. 
MR. MUSSA:
Your Honour, the next exhibit is P. 2.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, that's noted.  That is your P. 1 on the list is now P. 2.  Do you need the witness where he is standing now?  Is this a new map?  
(Exhibit No. P. 2 admitted)
MR. MOSES:
For the next three, I think, Your Honours, I should be able to do that, they are right by where he is standing now.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the next map coming up now, please.
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Have a look at the next map.  Do you recognise that map, Witness? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did you obtain that map? 
A.	Yes, I got the copy of the map from St. Paul centre. 
Q.	And briefly, what does the map show? 
A.	Here it is Jeunesse Ouvriers Catholic, that is called obrier prip stock (phonetic) and after that there is another one.  Here are some schools and other establishments, different.
Q.	Can you point out --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Listen, don't switch between languages.  You are now saying that here we have a youth centre of some sort.  Can you please repeat your answer in English?  So what is it that you want to show to us here.
THE WITNESS:
First I am going to the main road which approaches CELA and JOC.  This is the main road called Boulevard de OAU.  And here, in this point from here we enter inside JOC and this road takes us to the CELA.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Moses -- hold on -- the witness is now referring to a lot of places which are probably not in the spelling list or they may be but you really need to assist us now, otherwise, it is getting too complicated for the record.  So, now he referred to something after CELA which we all have and then the name of the road.  Can you help us, Mr. Moses?  

MR. MOSES:
Boulevard --
THE WITNESS:
OUA.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Boulevard OUA.  In other words the -- 
MR. MOSES:
O-U-A.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The African Union Boulevard.
MR. MOSES:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have that O-U-A Boulevard.  That was the first point.  Then there was a second reference.
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	All I want to you to do, Witness, is point out the buildings of CELA? 
A.	These are two buildings of the CELA.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, thank you.  
MR. MOSE:
Thank you. 

I now wish to tender that, the Prosecution Exhibit 3, Your Honours, unless there is any objection.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, what did you say -- you said, "and here is the point from where we enter the side of something."  We didn't get that.  What was the word you used, slowly, please.
THE WITNESS:
This is the point from where that road it enters into JOC and CELA.
MR. MOSES:
If I can assist, Your Honours, JOC is J-O-C, it stands for Jeunesse, J-U-N-E-S-S-E, Ouvriers, C-U-V-R-I-E-I-S (sic), Catholic, C-A-T-H-O-L-I-C.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, not on the spelling list.  That was helpful.  Any objections by the Defence?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Unfortunately, yes, Mr. President.  My client has just pointed out to me that it would have been appropriate for us to have that diagram in our possession so that we can talk about it with relation to the various points that have been mentioned by the Prosecution witness.  In fact, my client is referring to the fact that the JOC and St. Paul centre are not in the same location.  By the way, we have not been given the date on which this diagram was established and, for these reasons, we object to the tendering of that document.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know the date of this document, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
This document was prepared around 2003.
MR. PRESIDENT:
By whom?  
THE WITNESS:
This was prepared by the St. Paul centre.  They have our technicians.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That disposes of that issue.  There is still a need for all of us to have working copies of this document, probably in a smaller version.  Is it possible to down-size these two maps so that the Defence can have it, not immediately, of course, but later.
MR. MOSES:
We think so, but we believe we have given copies of this to the Defence.  I have certainly seen a map similar to it when I spoke to the Defence yesterday.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It may well be.  I cannot find these maps or small versions of them in the binder we have received.
MR. MOSES:
We can make copies available, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.  So there will then be made copies available to all of us, including the Bench, it being understood that it is the versions we have as P. 2 and now requested as P. 3 that are the exhibits of the case.
MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, there is P. 2.  We tried doing an 8x4 size of it yesterday and it was so -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, we will give up P. 2 and there was no request to that effect but we will hope that it is easier for P. 3.  

The next exhibit number here with this, I think, we have followed up the objections by the Defence.  This is a document with a date and the provenance and when it comes to the need to have it available you can, in addition to inspecting the original version, which is in the registry, it can be handed to the Defence team in connection with any cross-examination they would wish to conduct on this point in relation to this witness, or subsequently, you will also, as a courtesy, if you don't have it already, receive a down-sized version of this map, if it is technically possible.  

Next number, Mr. Mussa.
MR. MUSSA:
Your Honour it is P. 3.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
(Exhibit No. P. 3 admitted)
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, Witness, if you could please lift up the next map beneath there and is that a map which shows part of CELA, St. Paul, St. Famille and J-O-C, JOC? 
A.	This map, it also always shows the Boulevard OUA and here is the CELA and this area is of the 
	St. Paul. 
Q.	And finally, St. Famille, can you see the church on that map? 
A.	Here is the main building of St. Famille and down we come, here again it is (unintelligible) centre, here a supermarket, and we go down here to vehicle premiere (phonetic) of the St. Paul. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, I would ask that that map now be produced, Your Honour, subject to any objection.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are there any textual annotations on this map showing the buildings which were just referred to by the witness?  
MR. MOSES:
I can answer that.  Yes, there are, Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, so then the map will speak for itself.  Any objections concerning this document?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Mr. President, and it would be the same objection as previously, namely the dating of the diagram, which is not known to us, we want to formally challenge the relevance of the document in much the same way as the previous document which has been admitted already.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know the date of this document, Mr. Witness, when it was drawn up?  
THE WITNESS:
This also is part of the previous state (phonetic) we produced here, so that they have the same date, 2003, around 2003.
MR. PRESIDENT:
These two documents having been drawn in 2003, do you know whether the textual situation changed between 1994 and 2003?  Do you have any knowledge personally about this?  

THE WITNESS:
Yes, I was told and because I have been here in 1995, is that boundary walls which is now very good, one with the brick wall, they were not present there and some buildings were added.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is noted.  And if there is a wish from any party to pursue that later during the examination, you are free to do so.  

As for the relevance, we can see that these are locations in the indictment, so this is at least allegedly of relevance.  

Next number, Mr. Mussa. 
MR. MUSSA:
Your Honour is P. 4.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
(Exhibit No. P. 4 admitted) 
Mr. Moses.  
MR. MOSES:
On reflection, Your Honour, I wouldn't introduce the next map, which is very similar to that of one of the earlier maps.  That will save us some time.  Put that one down.
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, you can put that map down and if you will lift up the final -- is that also a map of Kigali in front of you? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And there are some numbers handwritten on that map? 
A.	Yeah, these are the numbers as stated by our witness.  They are the point of roadblocks. 
Q.	And was that Witness ALG who wrote that? 
A.	Yes. 
MR. MOSES:
Now, Your Honours -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Avoid that leading element.
MR. MOSES:
All right, Your Honours, obviously one of the witnesses later this week is ALG, who was going to talk about the map.  I had thought if we could front-end some of these documents, it would save time.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Certainly, it was only the form.  You could have asked, "Do you know which witness?"  
MR. MOSES:
Fine.  On that basis, Your Honour, I would simply seek to have that admitted.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Any problem with that document?  

Maybe we should have the date, Mr. Witness, and where did you get it from?  
THE WITNESS:
This map was drawn by the Prosecution team in a different case and I got it from the database.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And when was this done?  
THE WITNESS:
I'm not sure about it, but it was done probably in 2002 or 3.
MR. MOSES:
That information has been disclosed in a statement of ALG to the Defence and I can provide 
Your Honour, if there is any dispute about it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, any problem with this document?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Serious problems, Mr. President, Your Honours.  In as the Prosecutor told you it is a map on which ALG will be questioned, I do not see why another witness should come and through him that map should be tendered for this Court.  It would be appropriate for the Prosecutor to wait until ALG comes to testify to the issues which will be raised.  That is why the Defence is of the view that this is not the appropriate witness for that map to be tendered and we object.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But I understood the evidence to be that this document had been drawn up by the Prosecution on the basis of information from the witness and then it is a matter of taste how to do it.  I can't see any problem introducing this document now through this witness since they are actually the authors of it.  

Next number, Mr. Mussa.
MR. MUSSA:
Your Honour, next exhibit is P. 5.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
(Exhibit No. P. 5 admitted)
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, you can go and take your seat in the witness box.  I'll provide you with -- I'm now going to hand out to Your Honours photographs which were taken by this witness.  The Defence have copies of them, I have copies for Your Honours, and I have a copy for the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
In terms of the schedule, this booklet, in fact, contains photo book one, two, three and four which are 6, 7, 8 and 9 on the draft schedule.
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, would you please look at the first photo book.  In the course of your duties as an investigator were you asked to take photographs of the CELA institution?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And when did you do that? 
A.	This is what I have done at the end of 2005. 
Q.	Now, the photo book one, there is a description in respect of each photograph underneath the photos.  Have you looked at those descriptions and do they adequately describe the location that these photographs have been taken from? 
A.	Yes, they have.
MR. MOSES:
Now, Your Honour -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Who made these remarks?  Who wrote the subtitles under the photos?  
THE WITNESS:
That I have written.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you made the photos and you wrote the subtitles?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And when you said that the photos were taken in 2005, you refer to all the photos in photo book one?  Is that so?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
If there could be some pause between questions and answers, Mr. President.
MR. MOSES:
I'm in my friend's hands here, and Your Honours' hands.  I could have the witness go through each individual photo, but as they are described, I think it would save resources, unless my friends wish me to go through one by one.  It would save time simply to ask that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, for your purposes, there is no need now to do so and then we can leave it to the Defence to comment on the photos or individual photos, should they so wish. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And perhaps just to confirm, Witness, photo book 2 under tab 2, those are a series of photographs of the St. Famille church and its surrounds. 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And photo book three, photograph one, two and three, do they show the road and area where 
	Hotel Kiyovu used to be? 
A.	Yes on the right-hand side of the photo behind the team (phonetic) printing.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the spelling of that hotel is K-I-Y-O-V-U.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour, Kiyovu.
MR. MOSES:
That is number 93. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, if you could just briefly describe, if you could, in respect of photograph 5 and 6 the relevance of those photographs? 
A.	On which folder. 
Q.	In number three.
(Pages 8 to 25 by R. Lear)


















1045H
THE WITNESS:
This first photograph shows a crossing.  And the second one, it shows the location of the house of Iyamuremeye.  And on the left-hand side on the secteur office.  They are not very far.  They are quite close. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, you mentioned a name which I think is printed on the photograph.  But for the interpreters, if I could spell it.  I-Y-A-M-U-R-E-M-E-Y-E.  Looking if you could at the next photo, photograph 7, are you aware what, if any, role this building had during the period of the genocide? 
A.	This building which we see here, it has got three pits.  Very deep pits.  And the people who were taken out from St. Famille Church, brought here and put inside.  They had been killed and put inside.  
Q.	Thank you.  If I could refer you to photo document number 4.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before we move on, if you look at number 7, there you will find an abbreviation in brackets, RHS.  What does that mean?  
THE WITNESS:
That's the right-hand side. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And that means that LHS on some of the other photographs means left-hand side?  
THE WITNESS:
Sure.  Yes, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Do you know what the present function of this building is at the moment? 
A.	Yes.  I learned it was a house, residence of Iyamuremeye during 1994.  Then it has been changed to a church.  And then now it is a primary school.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  And looking at photograph -- photo book number 4, do those photos describe and show areas within the St. Paul Centre? 
A.	Yes. 
MR. MOSES:
Sorry.  My friend's got an objection.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Quite so.  Mr. President, Your Honours, I will simply like to know whether it is after we've gone through the entire album that I will object to the admission of such photographs.  Because on the third book, I already wanted to object to the admission.  So I don't know whether to raise the objection now, or to wait for the Prosecutor to go through the entire album.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Why don't we try to finish this first, and then you can come back to your objections.  Because so far we have not ruled on any of these photo books.  And, for instance, so far we only know that photo book number 1 contains pictures taken in 2005.  But we do not know when the photographs in the other photo books were taken.  That could be helpful. 
MR. MOSES: 
I'm sorry, Your Honour.  I thought you'd asked the witness that question.  But I will ask it.
BY MR. MOSES:  
Q.	When were the photographs taken in photo books 2, 3 and 4? 
A.	I made a little mistake on the first photograph.  Because this was taken at the end of the -- all photographs I took.  And that was taken, the first one number, number 1, in 2005.  And these other photographs were taken -- were taken in 2005.  First one, 2006. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Hold on.  Are you now referring to one particular photo book?  "Yes" or "no"?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour.  That's a photo book 1 CELA.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now we have photo book 1 in front of us -- 
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
-- and you want to correct something you said.  Can you now, a bit more slowly said, tell us what was the small mistake made, according to you?  
THE WITNESS:
The date.  The date.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And what did you say, and was the correct version?  
THE WITNESS:
I said it was in 2005.  I have a -- but it is printed here in 2006.  It is 2006.  And other photos I took before that period.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But does that mean that all photographs in photo book 1 was taken in 2006?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What about the year in relation to photo books 2, 3, and 4? 
 
THE WITNESS:
2, 3 -- 2 and 3 I took in 2005.  And the fourth I took in 2006.  As I remember.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
MR. MOSES: 
Now, Your Honour, I'm in Your Honour's hands.  There are referenced four separate photo books.  It's, obviously, in one folder.  Whether Your Honour wants it to be -- we'd be asking that they be tendered, whether Your Honour thinks it is preferable they be under one exhibit number, or four, I'm in Your Honours hands in relation to that.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The Bench prefers one exhibit.  But let us now hear any objections there may be in relation to photo books or individual photographs.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, it is not intention of the Defence to object, but we can see a risk in admitting the documents as has been done now, Mr. President, Your Honours.  

We consider that -- we can not, for instance, regarding photographs 5, 6 and 7 of book 3, that it is acknowledged we're taking now in 2006, and come and show pits which are identified, and which contain skeletons of the people killed in 1994.  

That was eleven years ago exactly.  And the investigator appearing before you can not say that the photographs he took were a clear correspondence of what he's coming to say before this Court.  So I do not understand how this bench can use the photographs for an objective and fair appraisal of facts in this trial.  

That is why Mr. President, Your Honours, we consider that those photographs can not be as systematically admitted as is being done now.  It is necessary to reject this one specifically because it contains some dangerous suggestions regarding the fair determination of the matter.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nekuie, do you have the French CaseView in front of you?  The electronic screen?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
No, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Any member of the Defence have it in front of you?  But don't you want it?  So why don't -- have you asked for it?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
We asked for it this morning, and were promised that it would be set up from tomorrow. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Very good.  So it's important that you also have that.  Because when in the French version you see three dots, that means that you are speaking too fast.  And now there were three dots.  So that should help you in the future.  But I'm sure we have it on the tape, so I think we can proceed. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
My apologies, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, we have noted when the photographs in these various photo books were taken.  Whether there will have been -- or whether there have been changes compared to 1994 is something which you will enlighten us on.  Both parties.  But there is no basis for not admitting this document for what it is; namely, photographs from 2005 and 2006 of relevant places. 

And we will then consider this as one exhibit, as it is containing these photographs in one file binder.  And that will then be, Mr. Mussa?  
MR. MUSSA:
Your Honour, to be P. 6. 
(Exhibit No. P. 6 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Counsel?  
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you.  Your Honours, I have some other photo albums which I'll ask be distributed.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, Witness, do you have the document in front of you?  Here, there's another.  
A.	I have exhibit volume 2.  
Q.	Now, Witness, have you seen these series of photographs before? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you know who took them? 
A.	This gentlemen who is seen here, he with Magassouba, another investigator.  
Q.	Investigator working for who?  
A.	ICTR. 
Q.	All right.  Are you aware if there was any witness present with them? 
A.	Yeah.  They went with some witness.  And they took this photograph as on -- the witness pointed out.
MR. MOSES:
Now, Your Honours, once again, Witness UI is going to be one of our Prosecution witnesses.  And it -- once again, it seems, I think, preferable -- the relevance of these photographs can be explained by Witness UI.  I'll be seeking -- these are photographs -- 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Do you know which date?  Looking at the cover, do you know what date these photographs were taken? 
A.	It's written 21st October 2002.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Any objections, Defence?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Not really an objection, Mr. President.  Because I would like to follow the reasoning of the Chamber.  But I'm wondering why my learned friend is not putting the document into evidence through the witnesses who are concerned.  I really don't understand why.  But if the Chamber wants to admit them, no objection from the Defence. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's fine.  And it's only a matter of practicality.  The reason is that, after all, it was not the witness who made the photographs, it was the Office of the Prosecutor.  And that's why we are allowing this in now in connection with the witness representing the Office of the Prosecutor.  But we will certainly come back to the photographs in connection with the individual witnesses.  

Any additional questions on this document?  That does not seem to be the case.  Mr. Mussa?  
MR. MUSSA:
It's P. 7.
 (Exhibit No. P. 7 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's now 11:00.  We will, then, have the 11:00 break, and we'll resume at 11:25.  The Court is adjourned.  
(Court recessed from 1100H to 1128H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecution?  
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  Final set of photographs. Tread gently here, Your Honour.  I have these photographs.  The Defence already have a copy of these photographs, Your Honour.  

Now, Your Honour, these photographs were taken by Witness BUX who was to be our second witness, but can't come for another month or so.  We do intend to possibly show some of those photographs to witnesses who appear prior to her arrival to give evidence as to when they were taken and where.  

In brief  -- and the Defence are aware of this.  And I had initially been told there wasn't any objection, but it may be that their position has changed.  There is a series of photographs taken at a roadblock, and a series of photographs taken at St. Famille Church.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Who took these photographs?  Any person from the Office of the Prosecutor?  
MR. MOSES: 
No.  It was a photographer who was present in Kigali.  It's Witness BUX. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So it has no link to the present witness?  
MR. MOSES: 
No.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. 
MR. MOSES: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So you want to come back to this in connection with BUX, maybe?
MR. MOSES: 
Well, Your Honour, my intention was -- they have all been entered into the database.  I don't wish the witness to comment at all on them.  Perhaps if they could be marked for -- the difficulty I foresee, Your Honour, is that if, for example, one or two photos are recognized by a witness who testifies from now until BUX testifies, those photographs may go in, but the others won't.  And we've got a booklet of photographs. 

Now, I don't -- obviously, their probative value will only become apparent when the witness testifies.  But it is my intention -- I would ask they be introduced in some form, Your Honour, so we can deal with them. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  But here the Defence objection is valid.  So what we will do now is simply to note that you have this compilation of photographs.  You are free to refer to them.  And you may tender them as an exhibit at any stage when you find it convenient.

It's difficult to see -- unless there is no objection from the Defence.  Is there no objection to the tendering of this document, or these photographs, in connection with the present witness?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, you have already pointed out a Defence objection.  And I think there is not need for the Defence to make any further comment.  We can not ask -- allow for the tendering of photographs taken through a witness who is not here present; whereas, it could be done otherwise.

MR. PRESIDENT: 
So we note this now.  We have it, all of us, in our personal files.  There is no need to mark them in any way.  But we have them.  And as with any other document, you can simply put it to any witness that may appear between now and the appearance of the witness that actually took the photographs.  
MR. MOSES: 
Very well, Your Honour.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	All right.  Now, Witness, if I can ask you to now look at the folder of exhibits, volume 1.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
May I ask you, when we look at this list on your front page of volume 1, Counsel, the document we just decided not to tender for the time being, it bears which code in your draft?  
MR. MOSES: 
P. 11. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
MR. MOSES: 
So now, Your Honour, we're moving on to the documents which are under the tabs in the folder.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And what happened to P. 10?  
MR. MOSES: 
I believe that this was the document which was admitted just before the break. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This is the P. 10 document. 
MR. MOSES: 
Absolutely. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  Then it's all clear.  Thank you.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, can you please look at the document under tab 1 in that folder.  Is that the statute creating the gendarmerie nationale in Rwanda?  
A.	Yes.  I have seen this.  
Q.	And do you have, under that tab, the French?  And there is also, I think, an English translation.  

All right.  And does it at paragraph 29 -- 
MR. MOSES:
That's on -- for the French, Your Honours, it's K0222542.  There's a page 738 in the left top hand corner. 
THE WITNESS:
P. 12?  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	P. 29.  
A.	Sorry. 
Q.	Section 29 of that statute.  The gendarmerie statute.  Under tab 1.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Witness, please switch on your mike.  We are now in the document concerning the gendarmerie which is the next document.  And what Counsel is doing is drawing your attention to paragraph 29 of that particular document.  Do you have it in front of you?  
THE WITNESS:
That's on P. 12?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Don't worry about the P numbering.  Do you have in the folder -- this is under number 2 there.  Do you have the gendarmerie nationale document in front of you?  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	You should be looking at volume 1.  You will see -- I think there are 31 tabs.  And we're looking at number 1.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, with other words, you are right that this is draft P. 12 in the Prosecution's folder.  But that draft P. 12 can be found under tab 1.  Have you found it?
THE WITNESS:
Yeah. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, please move on to paragraph 29 of that document.  Will you do that?  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And if I can refer you, the English is on page 6 of the English --
A.	21 -- 29 I have here.  Section 2. 
MR. MOSES:
All right.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And don't interrupt one another, because then it gets very complicated.  Only one speaks at a time.  So now it is the turn of counsel.  What is the question?
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Does that section, section 2, set out the powers to requisition the gendarmerie nationale? 
A.	Yeah.

MR. MOSES:
Without further ado, Your Honours, I would seek to tender that document on the basis that it is -- contains relevant evidence which may have probative value.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And this document comes from which compilation?  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, are you aware where the statute was obtained from?  
A.	This statute we obtained from the CND, Conseil national de développement.  That is the Rwandan parliament. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No.  No.  The question is, is this an official compilation of texts of some sort?  Do you know whether it is or not?  I mean, it looks official to me.  Isn't it?  We've seen this in other cases.  What do you know of the source of the document?  What -- is it taken from, for instance, (French spoken) or something like that?
THE WITNESS:
That is from the presidential decree.  That all the source of the law.  And it also comes from there.  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour -- 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Are you aware if it is a--what you have in front of you--is the legislative decree regarding gendarmerie nationale?  
A.	Yes.  I know that.  I'm confident. 
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you.  I'd seek to admit it, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Any problem?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
No problem. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Mussa?  
MR. MUSSA:
Your Honours, the next exhibit is P. 8.
(Exhibit No. P. 8  admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  Prosecution?  
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	If you could look now under tab 2 --
A.	Yeah. 
Q.	-- now, does that -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Let us see whether we can shortcut anything now.  Here follows from draft P. 13 to draft P. 18,  statutory provisions.  Would there be any problems in admitting these documents which seem to be simply laws or regulations?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Not at all, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So couldn't we tender them one by one now?  
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  Appreciate your assistance there.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Mussa, draft P. 13 becomes -- 
MR. MUSSA:
P. 9. 
 (Exhibit No. P. 9 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  Draft P. 14 is -- 
MR. MUSSA:
P. 10. 
 (Exhibit No. P. 10 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Draft P. 15 is P. 11.  Draft P. 16 is P. 12.  Draft P. 17 is P. 13.  Draft P. 18 is P. 14.  
 (Exhibit No. P. 11 is admitted)
(Exhibit No. P. 12 is admitted)
(Exhibit No. P. 13 is admitted)
(Exhibit No. P. 14 is admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecution? 
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honours.  If we could move on to the next one briefly.  It's under tab 8.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And if I can direct you to the bottom of page 1203 at the top.  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Any problem with this one, Defence?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I'm sorry.  I was having a consultation with my client, regarding the last document being discussed, I didn't quite follow.  I'm sorry. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
If you could kindly move to tab 8, which contains the presidential nomination of Colonel Renzaho as prefect of Kigali-ville dated 5 October 1990.  Do you have any problem with that document being admitted?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
No problem, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Mussa?  
MR. MUSSA:
It is P. 15.
 (Exhibit No. P. 15 admitted)  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Then follows six letters.  Is this something we should go through one by one?  Or is it possible for you, Prosecution, to give a global description of these letters?  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, if I can indicate.  As Your Honours will have seen, and if I can spend just a minute or two, from the pre-trial brief.  At this state in the process, there were very few, by the way -- by way of admissions by the Defence.  Which is perfectly their right to do so.  There are a number of documents which are now -- we're seeking to produce both from -- in the name of Renzaho.  Those that were sent to him, and a number of UNAMIR situation reports which refer to him.  And meetings.  This is just to give you a global overview, Your Honour.  

Now, it is our submission that in respect of those documents, they are relevant because they refer to places that the Accused may have been during 1994.  In respect of this first document under tab 9, it refers to an earlier occasion in 1991 where the Accused requires I.D. cards and permits of residence to be provided.  And, therefore, it is of some relevance in respect of the fact that what happened in 1994 wasn't the first occasion. 

So those are the -- I can indicate under tab 10, we don't intend to produce that document any more.  So that one can be put to one side.  Tab 11 is a letter from Renzaho requesting arms for persons who are allegedly being threatened.  There is a request which shows the power of the préfet to make such request for arms.  We don't know whether that is something which is in dispute or not, because we have no admissions regarding that.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence, we are now at draft P. 20.  And if you look at draft P. 20 until draft P. 25, these are letters.  Of these letters, draft P. 21 is not being sought to be admitted.  So we are left with one, two, three, four, five documents.  

Mr. Witness, these five documents, were they found by OTP investigators?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Are there any problems in admitting these five documents, Defence?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, unfortunately, there is a problem.  Because those letters, which are from draft P. 11 to, I believe, draft P. 20, as the Prosecutor say, tend to show the overwhelming power, seemingly, which my client had at the time. 

And those are documents which are very often referred to both in the indictment and in witness statements of the Prosecution witnesses. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I am very sorry.  This is just to make sure that we are on the same wavelength.  

What we have done now is, following the latest exchange, to admit until P. 19, which became P. 15.  That's where we are.  And the question I am asking you now, having done so, is whether you have any comments on draft P. 20 to draft P. 25, which would seem to be letters?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes.  And my answer was in the affirmative, Mr. President.  Because indeed there are letters which tend to demonstrate the excessive powers which the Accused had.  There are letters relating to certain testimonies which the Prosecutor intends to adduce before this Chamber.  Those witnesses who will testify, and during which testimony the documents will be admitted, do not have any capacity to demonstrate the relevance of the exhibit.  So within that, at a later stage, when the Prosecutor deems it necessary to demonstrate the relevance when each of those witnesses will be called to testify, then he will have to move to tender those letters.  But at this stage of the proceedings, they have no relationship with the witness.  

Now allow us to make an appraisal through this witness in light of what happened in 1994.  That is why we are objecting to the admission thereof. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  Just to make sure that we understand one another.  The reason why I needed your clarification was that in your first response you referred to P. 11 onwards.  But what you are really doing is responding, as I asked you to do, from draft P. 20 to draft P. 25.  

All right.  Any comment by the Prosecution?  
MR. MOSES: 
With the greatest respect to my friend, I would have thought his comments to Your Honour, in fact, provide the basis of themselves for their admission.  He's, from his own mouth, said that they show the Accused's power.  Therefore, when one looks at the Rule 89, whether a Chamber made admit any relevant evidence which it deems to have probative value, we have documents here, Your Honour, which the Accused's through his counsel accept have extreme relevance and they have probative value, as well, in our submission.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Anything to add, Defence?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, it is indeed at the level of the relevance of the documents that the problem arises.  One can not assess the relevance during the testimony of this witness.  That is the Defence position.  

Now the Defence is in your hands regarding the determination of the relevance and the probable admissibility.  But as far as the Defence is concerned, Mr. President, it is inappropriate for your Chamber today to assess the relevance of those documents so as to admit them now.  

That is the Defence position.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Prosecution, I see that some of these documents are dated before '94.  
MR. MOSES: 
That is correct, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Any comment on the relevance of documents pre-dating April to July '94?  
MR. MOSES: 
Well, yes, Your Honour.  In respect of the documents such as that under tab 11, which is marked "confidential", signed by the Accused, and is requesting from the minister of Defence a firearm to be provided for named people there.  What it establishes, in the Prosecution's submission, Your Honour, it's relevant because our case involves the requesting of firearms during 1994 during the period of the genocide. 

Now, as I indicated to Your Honour earlier, I don't know whether that is something which is admitted by the Defence or not.  This is a document which establishes that he had done so in 1993, and may help corroborate any direct testimony that Your Honour hears of arms request from the Minister of Defence during the period of the genocide. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
These documents were obtained by the present witness's organisation during investigations.  They are letters from or to the Accused.  They may well be dated earlier than '94.  But it may be alleged, without the Chamber now taking a position, that this has a bearing on the functions of the Accused in '94, that they are relevant.  There is no dispute as to their authenticity.  For these reasons, the Chamber can not exclude the tendering of these documents.  

So Mr. Mussa, will you help us now?  
MR. MUSSA:
Your Honours, the next exhibit is P. 16.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So P. 20 becomes P. 16.  Then we move to P. 22.  Mr. Mussa? 
 (Exhibit No. P. 16 admitted) 
MR. MUSSA:
17. 
 (Exhibit No. P. 17 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And P. 23?  
MR. MUSSA:
18.
 (Exhibit No. P. 18 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
P. 24?  
MR. MUSSA:
19. 
 (Exhibit No. P. 19 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
P. 25?  
MR. MUSSA:
20.
 (Exhibit No. P. 20 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  And as regards the weight of these documents, of course, the Chamber is not in a position to pronounce on this at the present stage.  
Prosecution?  
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  Your Honour, I won't at this stage, introduce the next document which is under tab 15.  I will now move on to tab 16.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, are you aware whether if UNAMIR, U-N-A-M-I-R, provided to the investigations department, any documents?  
A.	Yes.  They provided.  
Q.	Now, can you please look under tab 16.  At the top of that document there is a stamp "F. Claeys", C-L-A-E-Y-S.  Do you know who that person is?  
A.	He is of the UNAMIR.  He's a person from UNAMIR. 
Q.	All right.  And is this one of the documents received by the Tribunal from UNAMIR? 
A.	Yup. 
MR. MOSES:
Now, Your Honour, I'd seek to tender this document as an exhibit.  I am prepared to argue its relevance and probative value, if there is an objection to it.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And when did the Tribunal receive this document from UNAMIR representative, Claeys? 
(Pages 26 to 40 by Vicki Eastvold)


















1200H
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you know, Mr. Witness?  Or from somewhere else?  Some other source?  
THE WITNESS: 
That I haven't received, Your Honour.  It is registry now, database system.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, Your Honour, it would be our wish for the Prosecutor to justify the relevance of this document.  Because not only is it that the present witness claims to have culled this document from the database, and on which document it appears that Officer Claeys of UNAMIR is giving an account of events concerning our client, and which were told him by someone else.  And this is a chain of hearsay which does not allow for the establishment of the probative value of such a document, let alone relevance.  So we object to its admission.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Let's start with the relevance.  You said you were ready to argue that, Counsel.  Please do. 
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  In paragraph 2, my friend quite rightly points out that this is the paragraph of this document which is relevant to this case.  It is our case that the Accused was involved in the distribution of weapons leading up to the genocide, commencing in April 1994, and my friend quite rightly points out that this is an account of a meeting that Captain Claeys had with an informant who gave him information regarding the Accused allegedly giving -- distributing weapons in January 1994.  

I think the point that my friend made is -- the relevant one, namely, it's not so much a question of relevance, because clearly if the Accused was involved in such arms distribution it's extremely relevant.  The question is, is a question of weight that Your Honours should attach to this document in the absence, and it being hearsay.  Now, of course, hearsay is not inadmissible, and our submission would be that it may, once Your Honour has heard from direct evidence, it may assist Your Honour in corroborating such evidence.  

Of itself, Your Honours may feel that that in itself, just the production of that document, of itself, would be not of sufficient weight to place much importance on it, but having heard the testimony, Your Honours will be in a better position to assess what, if any, weight should be assigned to this report.  And that's, to be blunt, the argument that we make in regards to this document.  Thank you, sir.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence?  

MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, from what I observe it is impossible to give a probative value to the document, and that is what the Prosecutor is saying.  And I further submit that there is a problem of relevance here.  This is a document dating January 1994 and there is an intention to use that to establish the fact that the Accused allegedly distributed weapons from the 6th of April 1994.  I can't really see how this can be of use.  Accordingly, Mr. President, Your Honours, in order for the Chamber to avoid such problems which may be posed to the Defence, then I think you need to uphold our objection and set aside this document.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This is a document obtained by the OTP.  It bears a K or L number, 0022615.  It is dated within the time period mentioned in the mandate of the Tribunal.  The Accused's name is mentioned in the second paragraph.  For this reason, it may be argued that this is relevant.  It is relevant.  The question about the weight to be attached to this document is another matter, and we have noted the Defence's submissions in that regard and we will bear that in mind also later on the merits.  

Mr. Mussa?  
MR. MUSSA: 
Your Honours, the next exhibit is P. 21.
 (Exhibit No. P. 21 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So draft P. 27 becomes P. 21.  Thank you.  

Prosecution?  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, can I refer the witness, please, to tab 17?  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	On page 2, is there a signature?  
A.	Yes, I see.  
Q.	All right.  Do you know who prepared that interoffice memorandum?  
A.	Pardon?  
Q.	Do you know who prepared this memorandum?  
A.	The force commander to SRG -- SG. 
Q.	All right.  
A.	That's clearly it was General -- Brigadier General (unintelligible) his signature on it. 
Q.	All right, thank you.  And is this a document received from UNAMIR? 
A.	Yep. 

MR. MOSES:
I would seek to tender this document, Your Honour, and I'm prepared to argue its relevance if there's any objection.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence?  

The date of the document we are discussing now is?  
MR. MOSES: 
27th of January 1994.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Are you reflecting, Defence?  If you want time to reflect, just let us know.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
No objection, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Mr. Mussa?  
MR. MUSSA: 
The next exhibit is P. 22.
(Exhibit No. P. 22 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Prosecution.  
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, can I now refer you to the next document under tab 18?  What's that document?  Looking at the front page, are you able to tell the Court? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This is a document dated the 23rd of February '94 -- 
MR. MOSES: 
That's correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
-- from Mr. Booh-Booh to Mr. Annan and Mr. Jonah, J-O-N-A-H. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Is this a document also a -- from UNAMIR, Witness?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	All right.  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, I'm ready to argue its relevance, and I would seek to admit it.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
We don't object to the admission of the document, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Mussa?  
MR. MUSSA: 
It's P. 23.  
 (Exhibit No. P. 23 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Prosecution.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, can you now look at tab 19? 
A.	Yep.  
Q.	And is -- I think you have that letter, do you, in French and in English? 
A.	Yeah, I have it. 
Q.	And is that a letter from the Major General Nsabimana to the minister of defence? 
A.	Yeah. 
Q.	And is it copied -- looking at page 2 of the French version, is it copied to the préfet of PVK? 
A.	Yes. 
MR. MOSES: 
I would seek to tender this document, Your Honour, and I'm ready to argue its relevance if there's any objection.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
No objection.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Mr. Mussa?  
MR. MUSSA: 
It's P. 24. 
 (Exhibit No. P. 24 admitted) 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Yes, Witness, if you could now look at tab 20? 
A.	Yeah. 
Q.	Is that a letter from the Accused to Monsieur Le Chef, C-H-E-F, état major, chief of staff? 
A.	Yes, chief of staff. 
Q.	And does it have, as an attachment, a list of persons chosen for civil defence? 
A.	Yes, it shows that. 
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, I'd seek to tender that document. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, we do not intend to object, but simply because we are going by the reasoning of the Chamber which entails reserving the issue of the relevance and weight of the document in a timely manner, not during the appearance of this witness.  So we do not object to the admission of the document, subject, however, to those two reservations.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just to avoid any lack of clarity, we are admitting only documents which appear to be relevant.  But as for their weight, we reserve that for later.  So there is then the weight we will come back to later.  Is that clear?  

I understand there was no objection.  Mr. Mussa?  
MR. MUSSA: 
Your Honours, it is P. 25.  
 (Exhibit No. P. 25 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Prosecution.  
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, if I can refer you to tab 21.  
A.	Yep. 
Q.	Does that contain transcripts in Kinyarwandan, English, and French -- 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	-- of a -- an audio tape, AV938? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	I want to show you this -- if I can also hand to you this CD-ROM.  
MR. MOSES: 
To the witness.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, in respect of that CD-ROM that's in front of you, have you seen a CD-ROM like that before? 
A.	Yes, I saw it. 
Q.	All right.  And does it have the AV938 on it? 
A.	Yeah, I have -- it's there. 
Q.	In the course of your duties as an investigator, did you play that to any person?  
A.	Yeah, I did play to a witness. 
Q.	And without giving that witness's name, do -- are you aware of that witness's pseudonym? 
A.	ALG.  
Q.	ALG.  Right.  And did that witness recognise any voices on the -- what was played to him? 
A.	He recognised a voice in here. 
Q.	And did he say whose voice he recognised? 
A.	That's our accused, Mr. Renzaho. 
Q.	All right.  Now, are you aware where the tape containing that -- which has been made into a transcript, where it was obtained from? 
A.	The -- this only -- only this tape, it was not brought from that.  Our investigators, they have got and copied, with the consent of the ministry of rehabilitation.  Among that nearly 259 tapes, this was one of that. 
Q.	Do you know when the investigators copied the tape? 
A.	This was done in 1997 and '96.  It took a bit -- long time to copy all the tapes.  
MR. MOSES: 
All right, Your Honours, I'm seeking to admit that -- the audio tape, together with the transcripts that are there, and I'm ready to argue issues of relevance and admissibility if there's any objection.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, we have an objection for the following reasons:  First of all, Mr. President, we never received the recording, or the cassette of this tape to be certain that the voice mentioned is indeed our voice.  

Secondly, Mr. President, Your Honours, it has not been established before the Court that these recordings flow from the radio stations which have been mentioned, and that the broadcasts actually took place on the dates that have been mentioned.  We therefore do not see how, without establishing that authenticity, your Trial Chamber could admit this into evidence within this trial.  

Third, Mr. President, Your Honours, we have all heard that these are tapes that were purportedly recognised by a witness -- a Prosecution witness who is absent.  These are tapes that were not collected and compiled by the witness appearing before the Court at this moment, because he claims that these were obtained in 1996 or '97 by OTP investigators.  And that casts doubt and ambiguity as to the authenticity of these tapes, and therefore their admission can only be prejudicial to the Defence.  

And it is for these reasons, Mr. President, that we object to the tendering of this document.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This transcript is reflecting, according to the Prosecution, transmissions in which radio channel?  
MR. MOSES: 
I believe it was in fact an intercept, Your Honour, of a telephone -- of telephone conversations.  So they were not on the radio.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
That makes the matter more serious, Mr. President.  And we therefore insist on our objection.  
MR. MOSES: 
Is Your Honour in a position to hear me, or do you wish to... 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We are ready to listen.  
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honours.  This piece of evidence there is reference to in the pre-trial brief on page 28, where we address the issue of the Accused's intent, and we look at the evidence which will be adduced to show the Accused's intent.  Under paragraph A, we say:  "The Accused talked of extermination during an intercepted telephone conversation with the bourgmestre of Bicumbi, Mr. Rugambarara."  So it's in that part of -- there's direct reference to it in the pre-trial brief.  

In the annex to the most updated summary of Prosecution witnesses, Your Honours will see in regards to Witness ALG, the last sentence where, "ALG will identify Renzaho as a speaker on the radio intercept exhibited by the Prosecution."  

You will further see, Your Honour, in the summary of witnesses, the second-to-last witness on the final page of those summaries is Witness BKX, who will be saying that BKX knew Renzaho before April 1994 and will give evidence that it is Renzaho's voice on a recording of an intercepted telephone call in which he talks about extermination.  

Your Honours, I have copies -- I've got two copies, Your Honour, of the disclosure that has been made to the Defence regarding the testimony of BKX.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This telephone conversation took place when?  
MR. MOSES: 
It seems to have been placed on the 26th of April 1994.  If you look at the statement from the witness, you will see he clearly says that he's listened to tape AV938, points out the passage -- the relevant passage, which has been, we say -- will submit, wrongly ascribed to Karera.  If I can point you to the transcript itself, Your Honour, I think it will highlight the relevance of this piece of evidence.  In the English, it's on page 31 and 32.  

Now, it is, in our submission, we believe the only time in the Tribunal's history that there is evidence -- direct evidence of a tape recording where an accused orders the extermination of people.  Your Honour will see on page 32, the fifth line down, where we say it has been -- but we've left it as it is.  But we are going to call witness testimony, it's going to be a matter of -- for Your Honours to -- to weigh this up.  But the passage which is assigned to Karera, which says:  "Exterminate them truly."  There is then a response, and then there is another response:  "You see, exterminate all of them."  There could not be any more relevant evidence.  It is of the highest degree of relevance, in the Prosecution's submission.  

In respect of the weight to which it is assigned, then clearly that is a matter which Your Honour will -- Your Honours will weigh, having heard ALG and/or BKX and any other witnesses -- and those witnesses regarding it.  So, clearly the Defence can cross-examine.  They certainly can't say that they haven't been on clear, unequivocal notice as to what we were going to introduce and why.  And it is of extreme probative value and of the greatest relevance.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
There are two pending names now for the transcripts.  The first name is Bicumbi, which is written B-I-C-U-M-B-I, and then you referred to one of the interlocutors in the telephone conversation, whose name is spelt R-U-G-A-M-B-A-R-A-R-A.  

Anything to add?  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour will -- well, this intercept was not introduced in the Karera trial, for obvious reasons, namely that the Prosecution position is that it is not Karera.  The witnesses, when you hear from them, you will have to assess how well they knew both of the persons involved and weigh up what weight, if any, should be given to their evidence of identifying the voices on this telephone intercept.  But that's -- that's all I wish to say for -- in regard to this matter at this stage, Your Honour.  Thank you.  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, in addition to our previous submissions relating to the inadmissibility of this document, namely, lack of relevance and probative value, I would like to add, Mr. President, that regarding this specific document, Rule 75 (sic) must be taken into account.  Let me read Rule 75, Mr. President, which provides as follows -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Mr. President, if counsel would specifically mention the rule he's referring to.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  I think you are about to read from a portion of Rule 75; is that so?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Rather, Mr. President, I was reading from 95, Rule 95.  Rule 95 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  Do we all have Rule 95 in front of us?  I think you can start reading slowly now.  Please do.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Rule 95 provides as follows:  "No evidence shall be admissible if obtained by methods which cast substantial doubt on its reliability, or if its admission is antithetical to and would seriously damage the integrity of the proceedings."  

That is Rule 95, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Now, this document before the Court, Mr. President, is one which Defence submits cannot be tendered before your Trial Chamber simply by stating that telephone conversations have been intercepted on the 26th of April 1994.  And the interception purportedly was transcribed in 1996, two years later.  

By the way, Mr. President, we do not know who ordered the interception, who authorised that interception, what were the legal conditions allowing for such telephone conversations to be intercepted.  

Mr. President, in 2006 -- or, should I say, in 2007, this tape is brought before the Court.  It does not bear the name of the Accused, but simply purportedly relates to discussions involving Mr. Karera, who is not Mr. Renzaho.  And the claim is being made, Mr. President, that such an illegal document could be relevant in Mr. Renzaho's trial.  With all those defects, Mr. President, I believe that your Chamber has no choice but to dismiss this document.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I just heard you say that the document was illegal.  What is the basis for that submission?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
(Microphones overlapping) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's true, as you said, that we do not know who authorised or the conditions.  But the illegality, could you help us with that, please?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President, Your Honours, it is not for the Defence to determine the illegality of the document.  We know very well that for telephone conversations to be intercepted, there are strict guidelines and authorisations that must be obtained.  We therefore do not understand how these conversations could have taken place in 1994, during the war -- I will slow down.  

In 1996, Mr. President, we do not even know whether this was a telephone interception, or the interception of a conversation that took place, purportedly in 1994.  So what is it that allows us to determine whether this document is legal?  1994 was a time of war, and at that time it was only the Rwandan armed forces who may have been possibly in possession of such a document.  So, is it the army which is the source of this document?  Is it a document from the RPF?  And if so, what was the authority of the RPF to make such a determination as to the authorisation for such an interception?  

So, Mr. President, there is a lot of ambiguity around this document.  And for these reasons I believe that the illegality is obvious.  And by the way, it is not for the Defence to establish the legality of the document, because the onus is on the Prosecutor who has to establish the authenticity and the legality of that document.  And that has not yet been demonstrated.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, do you know where this document comes from?  
THE WITNESS: 
This document -- document comes from the ministry of rehabilitation of Rwanda.  And only our investigators, they got it at the time I have stated in my previous saying, but this was kept in the Rwandan authorities' archive.  And still they have the original tape recording there in their possession.  So the -- this is an official document, officially kept, in a sovereign and legal government.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And -- this may be a bit repetitive, but just to go step by step:  And when did your office receive this from the ministry of rehabilitation?  
THE WITNESS: 
Your Honour, I haven't received it, but we have the correspondence that our officers who received this tape and the final submission to our database system was on 6 February 1997. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you know when the OTP received this document from the ministry?  
THE WITNESS: 
That's the -- there was a submission from the Rwandan authority name Vianney Ruyombyana, who has given us a written statement in 30th October 1996 that he has given us the final document that day.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We could have the spelling of the last name, please?  Slowly.  
THE WITNESS: 
R-U-Y-O-M-B-Y-A-N-A. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  And do you know who intercepted this conversation?  
THE WITNESS: 
Really speaking, I don't have the knowledge.  But many tapes are there in their archives that was intercepted at that time in 1994.  
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Mr. Witness, did you try to find out the circumstances under which this document was obtained?  Namely, when this interception was carried out?  Did you try to find out this in the archives or from any other authorities in Rwanda?  
THE WITNESS: 
Personally speaking, I didn't try, and I was not involved in the acquisition of these tapes.  
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you know the procedure used in connection with this interception?  Do you have any knowledge about the conditions?  
THE WITNESS: 
In 1994, the government used to order -- I heard, but I don't have any written document or any statements.  They used to take the conversation like that.  And normally what we have found, that everything that said in any conversation and interception in a code -- coded language.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you have any view as to whether this was recorded by the government or the RPF?  
THE WITNESS: 
These documents were recorded by the Rwandan authorities, because the RPF has not control at that time to the telecommunication system.  It was under the Rwandan government.  That I believe the Rwandan government has intercepted it.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, all right.  

Do you have anything to add, Prosecution?  
MR. MOSES: 
Only that I think, Your Honours, come the end of the trial, once Your Honours have had the opportunity of hearing witnesses comment regarding this, Your Honours will be in a better position to place -- to decide what, if any, probative value should be placed on it.  And that's also, in my submission, following submissions regarding the contents of the tape as a whole, which refer to particular incidents.  On page 32 (sic), for example:  "Have things got under way in Butare yet?"  We will make -- that's at the very top of page 32 in the English version.  

So there are other indicia in there, Your Honour, which I would be submitting we can go through and argue regarding its weight and/or reliability.  But it is of the utmost relevance in the Prosecution's submission.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you meant to refer to the top of page 31, and that's all right.  

Defence, any final submissions on this?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President.  First of all, when reference is made to a document, and given that we are working in French, we would like to have the corresponding page in French.  Otherwise we are at a loss.  

Now, as far as this document goes, Mr. President, Your Honours, this is a very important question we are dealing with here.  You have heard what the Prosecution's submissions are, and you may want to agree with me that we all know that telephone interceptions are very dangerous matters when it comes to issues of freedom, and that is why the rules governing such interceptions are very strict.  That is what we are trying to establish today, in respect of this document before the Court.  If we are not able to determine who ordered the interceptions, if we do not know the reasons under which those interceptions took place, and how the transcripts were developed, then there is a question around the integrity of that document, and that raises questions of admissibility in view of Rule 95, which we mentioned a short while ago.  

Once more, I am certain that the Tribunal is aware that this type of document is very likely to be manipulated, and that is why national legislation has always been very strict around these types of issues.  That is all I would have to say in relation to the admissibility of this document, Mr. President.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The Chamber is not in a position to admit this document at the present stage.  The Accused's name is not in this document.  Prosecution, you will have to address us, if you so wish, later in the trial.  

MR. MOSES: 
Yes, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Meanwhile, could you first assist in finding the equivalent in French of page 32 of the English version, if that could be communicated.  And secondly, there was a reference to the recording of this not having been given to the Defence.  But that is what you just gave to the Defence this -- 
MR. MOSES: 
I've got a copy here, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  So the Defence would wish to -- if they have not already received it, to receive the audio version of this purported piece of evidence in order to assess this further.  
MR. MOSES: 
Just a very brief matter, Your Honour.  So, for my learned friends, it's on K0167848 and 7849.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Your next possible exhibit?  
MR. MOSES: 
Yes.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, can I refer you to tab 22? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And is that a UNAMIR cable from General Dallaire to Mr. Annan? 
A.	Yes, I see.  
Q.	And is it dated the 25th of April 1994? 
A.	Yes. 
MR. MOSES: 
And Your Honours, I'm seeking to tender that, and I'm ready to argue its relevance.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Any problem, Defence?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
No objection, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Mr. Mussa?  

MR. MUSSA: 
Your Honour, it's P. 26.  
 (Exhibit No. P. 26 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Next?  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Yes, Witness, look please at tab 23.  
A.	Yes, I see.  
Q.	And is that also another cable from General Dallaire to Mr. Annan, dated the 25th of April? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And does it come with two pages of attachments? 
A.	Yes. 
MR. MOSES: 
I would seek to admit that, Your Honour, and I'm ready to argue admissibility. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No problems, says the Defence.  

Mr. Mussa?  
MR. MUSSA: 
Your Honours, it is P. 27.  
 (Exhibit No. P. 27 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, now under tab 24 -- 
A.	Yep. 
Q.	-- is there an English, French, and Kinyarwandan copies of a letter to préfets from the prime minister of the time, Jean Kambanda, dated 27th of April 1994?  
A.	Yes, I have this one.  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, I seek to tender this document.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
No problem, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Mussa?  
MR. MUSSA: 
Your Honours, it is P. 28.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
A for the Kinyarwanda version, B for the French, and C for the English.  
(Exhibit No. P. 28A, P. 28B, and P. 28C admitted) 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, now if you could look, please, under tab 25.  
A.	Yeah, it's here.  
Q.	And is that a memo from Major -- on page 2, is it a memo from Major MacNeil -- 
A.	Yeah . 
Q.	-- to the FC, which I think you mentioned earlier was force commander; is that correct? 
A.	Yep. 
Q.	And is that dated the 28th of April 1994.  
MR. MOSES: 
	I would seek to -- I'm sorry, I think there are two dated the 28th of April.  There's a second one behind that dated -- from the -- it's addressed to the chief operations officer, a daily humanitarian report, number 4.
THE WITNESS:
	Yes, we have here.  
MR. MOSES: 
I seek to tender those documents, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Are these two documents, or are they linked?  
MR. MOSES: 
I believe they are linked.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
In what way?  What is the link?  I can see that we have -- 
MR. MOSES: 
Both are on the same date. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
 -- on the last page here a facsimile -- a fax from Booh-Booh to Annan dated the 29th of April.  And that one talks about five pages, and the subject is the daily situation report, 28 to 29 of April.  What we have in front of that document are these pages. 
MR. MOSES: 
Ah, yes.  I'm sorry, Your Honours.  That page 561 should be the cover sheet to tab 26.  I apologise for that.  That's -- we've all got the same -- it's K0000561, which should be before the first page of the document under tab 26, which is the following number.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  That clarifies the matter, and we will move that document to the next tab number now.  But then to the link between the two documents, can anyone explain that?  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour -- I'm sorry, Your Honour.  I can't at the moment, and perhaps if we can simply remove the last page, which is the interoffice memorandum from HAC to the chief operations officer.  I'm happy that doc -- that page be removed.  And we simply tender -- I seek to tender the two-page document from Major MacNeil to the force commander.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
If we proceed according to the Prosecutor's proposal, Mr. President, there will be no objection.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So these two pages, then, Mr. Mussa, will be?  
MR. MUSSA: 
P. 29.  
(Exhibit No. P. 29 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Next?  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, if you could look under tab 26.  Is that a situation report -- 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	-- from Mr. Booh-Booh to Mr. Annan? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Covering the period of the 28th to 29th April? 
A.	Yes, sir.  
MR. MOSES: 
I would seek to adduce that, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No objection, says the Defence.  

Mr. Mussa?  
MR. MUSSA: 
Your Honours, it is P. 30.  Three-zero.  
(Exhibit No. P.30 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Next?  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, tab 27, is that a memorandum to the chief operations officer dated the 29th of April? 
A.	Yes, I see it.  
MR. MOSES: 
I would seek to admit that, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What is "HAC"?  It's from HAC.  Who is he or she?  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, are you aware -- 
A.	Humanitarian assistance coordinator.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the signature there, do you recognise it?  Is that also Mr. MacNeil, or is there someone else?  
MR. MOSES: 
I believe it is Mr. MacNeil.  I'm just looking for a memo with his name and initials beneath it.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
No particular objection, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Mr. Mussa?  
MR. MUSSA: 
It's P. 31.  
(Exhibit No. P. 31 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's one o'clock.  We will then have the lunch break until 2:30.  It would be helpful if the Defence could indicate, when we meet again, whether there are documents from draft P. 39 onwards, that they can say right away that there are no objections.  Because then we will know that maybe we can speed some of the documents up a little bit and concentrate on the problematic ones.  

Is there anything else to be said before we go for lunch?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
No, Mr. President.  The next two documents can already be admitted, Mr. President, if the Prosecutor were to produce them, because we do not intend to object to the tabling of those documents.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But let's do that right away.  
Mr. Mussa?  Draft P. 39 is a UNAMIR memo dated 29th of April 1994, becomes then?  
MR. MUSSA: 
It's P. 32.  
(Exhibit No. P. 32 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And draft P. 40, dated 30th of April, a UNAMIR memo to Dallaire, becomes?  
MR. MUSSA: 
P. 33.  
(Exhibit No. P. 33 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay, thank you.  

And then it's lunchtime.  Court is adjourned.  
(Court recessed at 1304H)
(Pages 41 to 58 by Kirstin McLean)























(Court resumed at 1436H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecution. 
MR. MOSES:
Yes, thank you, Your Honour.  I'm pleased to advise you that I had a discussion with the Defence, further to Your Honour's suggestion, and I'll ask if my friend can confirm the situation, but I understand that the remaining documents are to go in by -- without objection.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I understand that is the case.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Quite so, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much indeed.  

Mr. Mussa, are you ready?  Is there any document of the remaining numbers, from alleged P. 41 on, which you are not going to tender? 
MR. MOSES:
No, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  All right.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, may I? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Just to state that we said we would not object to the admission of the documents, subject to the Prosecution's commitment to disclose to us the electronic format of the radio broadcast, and the Prosecutor had accepted to do so.  We agreed that we would need to have the electronic formats of the radio broadcast, so that we will be able to listen to them ourselves.  
MR. MOSES:
Quite so, Your Honour.  It is the position.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good.  And it seems to me that, due to the break, you have forgotten to speak slowly.  So remember that now.  

We will then start with proposed P. 41 under tab 30, letter of 1st May 1994.  

That will then be, Mr. Mussa? 
MR. MUSSA:
Your Honours, the next exhibit is P. 34. 
(Exhibit No. P. 34 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then we have proposed number 42, UNAMIR situation report dated 4th May 1994.  

Mr. Mussa. 
MR. MUSSA:
Your Honour, it is P. 35. 
(Exhibit No. P. 35 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then number 44, 25th May 1994, directives from the prime minister. 

Mr. Mussa. 
MR. MUSSA:
Your Honours, it's P. 36. 
MR. MOSES:
I'm sorry to interrupt, Your Honour.  There was a document I think that we skipped over, which is under tab 1A, which is a Kinyarwandan document, an example of a laissez-passer issued from the préfecture office and dated the 24th of May '94 -- 12th.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are right.  So that's number 43, dated 12th May 1994.  So the P. 43 becomes P. 36. 
(Exhibit No. P. 36 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
P. 44 becomes P. 37. 
(Exhibit No. P. 37 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
P. 45, the letter from Édouard Karemera of 25th May 1994, becomes P. 38. 
(Exhibit No. P. 38 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
UNAMIR situation report of 7th June 1994, now P. 46, becomes P. 39. 
(Exhibit No. P. 39 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
UNAMIR memo, 15th of June, becomes P. 40. 
(Exhibit No. P. 40 admitted)

MR. PRESIDENT:
UNAMIR situation report of 15th of June 1994 becomes P. 41. 
(Exhibit No. P. 41 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
These are two different documents?  
MR. MOSES:
Yes, they are, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
UNAMIR situation report dated 17th June 1994 becomes P. 42.

MR. PRESIDENT: 
These transcripts are in several languages; is that so?  
MR. MOSES:
Yes, Your Honour.  The schedule shows what languages are in the folder.  It -- we do have Kinyarwandan transcripts, though those have not been annexed to the folder.  And I am -- we can arrange to do that if Your Honour thinks it is advisable to do so.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
To the extent possible, I think we would have under each of these transcripts A for the Kinyarwanda, B for the French, and C for the English.  

Is that noted, Mr. Mussa?  
MR. MUSSA:
Yes, Your Honour. 
MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, we will arrange for the Kinyarwandan transcripts to be photocopied, and -- and we will hand them -- perhaps that can be done -- it need not necessarily be done, I take it, in the presence of this witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Not at all -- 
MR. MOSES:
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- not at all.  No, no.  That's an administrative matter. 
MR. MOSES:
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So that could be handed to Mr. Mussa, and he will then ensure that this is being done.  And if he could be given the missing Kinyarwanda versions, we will all place them into our own binders.  So all we need are the additional copies. 
MR. MOSES:
Certainly, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

So these were the documents you wanted to tender through this witness?  Do you have any other questions for this witness? 
MR. MOSES:
I do not, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much indeed.  

Is there any cross-examination of this witness, Defence?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Mr. President, Your Honours.  The cross-examination will be very brief, and it will focus on the first documents tendered before this Court.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  We have volume 1 in front of us.  Thank you very much.  Just proceed.  

Are you starting with volume 1 or the photographs?  Where are we starting?  
MR. NEKUIE:
I will start with volume 1, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Very well.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Most obliged, Mr. President. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, when the question was put to you regarding the date of Exhibit P. 3, which is the sketch of CELA and the JOC, you said "the sketch dated 2003"; is that correct? 
A.	Yeah, but I am not sure the date.  It was in April 2003.  
Q.	Thank you, sir.  You are not certain of the date, but are you certain about the person or persons who prepared that sketch?  Are you in a position to tell us who authored the sketch? 
A.	This has been done by the cartographer of the St. Paul Centre in Kigali.  I don't remember, and I have noted the name.  It is written on the big sketch. 
Q.	Thank you, sir.  During your site trips, did you personally prepare any sketch? 
A.	I haven't presented any sketch, I think, at this level.  
Q.	So do you agree with me that the two sketches which you produced before this Court today are sketches whose authenticity you cannot positively ascertain before this Court? 
A.	Those sketches were obviously obtained from the Centre pastoral St. Paul at Kigali, and we have got it from their archive, so that is the authentic document.  And I have presented in one piece.  It has been photocopied in many pieces, to give you the different locations.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Let's make sure that we understood your answer now.  These sketches were obtained from which centre?  
THE WITNESS:
That is Centre pastoral de St. Paul in Kigali.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Now we have that.  

Next question, please.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, as far as you are concerned, are those sketches a fair depiction of the layout of that centre as it was in 1994? 
A.	Yeah.  It was the things which you see there, those walls.  The boundary walls, all the brick boundary walls, they were not present at the time of the events in 1994.  Other -- they have put little (unintelligible) -- they did (unintelligible) on there, but they haven't changed anything there of the old structure. 
Q.	Thank you.  Let us now move to the photograph which was admitted into evidence through you, Witness.  

On some of those photographs, you highlighted the residence of a person called Iyamuremeye, in which residence you took photographs of pits with skeletons.  When, if at all, did you personally take those photographs, and when did you realise there were skeletons in those pits? 
A.	No, that is not our -- many witnesses, they have come from there where the victims they have been thrown after killing them or some were alive.  But when we went there, that time I have to take the photographs, those pits were filled up of -- only the houses were there, and the bodies of -- the remaining -- remains are taken to the new mass burial sites.  That's all.  
Q.	Thank you.  So it is your evidence before this Court that you did not see human remains on the scene of the photographs?  Is that correct? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  And, lastly, do you confirm that all those photographs were actually taken in 2006? 
A.	Some of the photographs, they were taken in 2005, at the end of 2005.  Some were in 2006.  
Q.	But, Witness, when one looks at your album, the date on it is the 5th of June 2006.  How do you expect people to make a difference between the photographs taken in 2005 and those taken in 2006? 
A.	No, they have been taken in different time, and in many times we have to take it -- sometime with the photos which we wanted to produce, it was not well done so we have to go and retake it.  So the -- one photo in one folder might be the same date or another date.  I haven't taken the same date all the photographs.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
When we heard your testimony earlier today, we noted that photo book number 1 contained photographs taken in the end of 2-6; number 2 contained 2005 photographs; number 3, 2005 photographs; number 4, 2006 photographs.  Now, does this mean that this summary is not necessarily correct because you had to go back in relation to individual photographs and take them again, or is the summary I just gave of your previous testimony still correct? 
THE WITNESS:
Only that that one, the first photographs, which I have said that was incorrect.  That was taken in 2005.  And it was binded on the -- instead of lastly, it was come to first.  So I didn't remember well.  But all the photographs were taken in 2005 and 2006. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
THE WITNESS:
I cannot give the precise date when I had taken. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And that's quite understandable. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are not requiring that, but we just want to understand the testimony.  

Now, you referred to the first photograph, which was incorrect.  And that was exactly as you said in your previous testimony. 
THE WITNESS:
The 2006 that I have corrected later on, maybe I couldn't convey to Your Honour the date. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, in light of the additional questions just put by the Bench to the witness, the Defence has no further questions in cross for this witness.  So we end at this stage.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Defence.  
Any re-examination, Prosecution?  
MR. MOSES:
No, thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That was the end of your testimony, Mr. Witness.  Thank you very much for coming to Arusha and contribute to the trial.  We wish you a pleasant journey home.  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President and Honourable Judges and other colleagues.  Bye.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The next witness is AFB. 
MR. MOSES:
That's correct, Your Honour.  And that witness's evidence will be led by my friend, Ms. Melluish. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will then ask that witness to be brought in.  

Is there a personal information sheet?  Could that be distributed in parallel with this witness leaving the courtroom, please. 
(Witness excused)
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, perhaps I could make it clear that I have just one or two questions to ask, preferably at the beginning, in closed session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's noted, but we will still, in open session, swear in the witness. 

You have disclosed a lot of witness statements on the 15th of December.  Where do we find the statements of this witness, in which folder?  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Witness.  Just sit down, please.  

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness and will be referred to as Witness AFB in these proceedings.  You have to tell the truth, and the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
(Declaration made by Witness AFB in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have a document in front of you there, Mr. Witness, with your signature?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I do recognise that document.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The information in this document is correct, isn't it?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, the information contained in this document is correct.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does that bring us to P. 64, Mr. Mussa? 
MR. MUSSA:
Yes, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal.
(Exhibit No. P. 64 admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will then start in closed session for approximately five minutes, maybe less, and then we will move into open session again.  

If those in the public gallery could leave us for five minutes, please. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 69 to 70] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 59 to 68 by Ann Burum)















MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we are now in open session in order to hear your testimony, and it's still Witness AFB who is being examined in-chief.  

Prosecution?  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Mr. Witness, could you tell the Court, please, your ethnic origin.  
A.	I am Hutu. 
Q.	And could you tell the Court where you were living in April -- early April 1994.  
A.	I lived in Biryogo secteur to the east of ************** in Nyarugenge commune; that is in Kigali préfecture -- Kigali town préfecture.  
Q.	Can you tell us where you were on the morning -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  The name of the secteur you said was?
MS. MELLUISH:
Oh, I'm sorry.  That's at number 14.
THE WITNESS:
Biryogo.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you repeat the number, please. 
MS. MELLUISH:
Number 14. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Number 14 on the spelling list.  Yes.  And now you were just about to ask a question. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Could you tell us, please, where you were on the morning of the 7th of April 1994.  
A.	I was at home -- at my home.  
Q.	And that morning did you have reason to leave your home? 
A.	I left my home because we were wondering what was happening, given that we heard gunshots from the town.  At about 7 in the morning, communal police came at the behest of Conseiller Amri Karekezi, and they had come from the Biryogo secteur office.  
MS. MELLUISH:
The name Karekezi appears at number 80 on the list. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the interpreters would like to have a copy of the spelling list as well.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Of course you must have that.  Have you not received it? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We see it's on the way, Mr. President.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And since everyone is so nice to the interpreters, now maybe the Bench could have the copies we gave to everyone in the courtroom.  So we miss two copies here.  We have Judge Arrey's copies, which we are desperately using now. 
(Pages 71 to 72 by Ann Burum)































     1515H
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, the Defence would like to have a copy as well.  I'm sorry, Mr. President, we already have a copy.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's good to hear.
MS. MELLUISH:
I'm sorry, Your Honour, I'm unclear as to who is lacking at this stage a copy of this list.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you want to know who has no copy, that is Judge Egorov and me, we gave it to the court reporters.
MS. MELLUISH:
If I can ask somebody to go make copies immediately, I'll make five or six and make sure everyone has one.  I apologise on behalf of the Prosecution.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's fine.  Make sure it is done.  Has Mr. Mussa got a copy or someone else?  Now it's done.  Let's move on.
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you said that communal policemen came to your house.  How many policemen was that? 
A.	Two communal policemen. 
Q.	And did they say anything to you?
A.	They told me that Conseiller Amri Karegesi (phonetic) wanted me to go and see him at the secteur office. 
Q.	And at that time did you have any idea why you were required at the secteur office? 
A.	No, it is only when I arrived at the secteur office that I found out ************* the vehicle at the secteur office, the previous evening, and when I got there the conseiller told me to go to the préfectural office with that vehicle in the company of two communal policemen. 
Q.	Just to clarify, Mr. Witness, what vehicle are you talking about? 
A.	It was a double cabin Hilux pickup with registration number belonging to the state. 
Q.	So, when the conseiller told you to go to the préfecture office, what did you do? 
A.	I went there in compliance with his orders.  I had no choice.  I went immediately because I did not know why he was dispatching me to the office.  
Q.	Did you go alone or were you accompanied by anyone? 
A.	I went along with the two policemen, those very two policemen who had come to see me at my home. 
Q.	And at that stage, Mr. Witness, did you know why you were going to the préfecture office? 
A.	No, but I was afraid.  I was afraid because gunshots could be heard in Kigali town. 
Q.	Can you tell us how long it took to get from the secteur office to the préfecture office? 
A.	It was not far away.  It took me three to five minutes. 
Q.	And on the way to the préfecture office did you notice anything unusual? 
A.	What I noticed -- what I saw, which was unusual, was soldiers around the mosque and ONATRACOM on the road leading to the military camp in Kigali.
MS. MELLUISH:
ONATRACOM is at 195 of the spelling list.
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Can you tell us what you found at the préfecture office when you arrived? 
A.	I found many people at the préfectural office, soldiers, communal policemen, bourgmestres, conseiller of various secteurs in Kigali-Ville préfecture.  I also saw a very well-known Interahamwe at the préfectural office whose name is Mugesera, and there was another Interahamwe known as Karim who was present and both of them were from Bucyogo (phonetic).
MS. MELLUISH:
Mugesera appears at 101 on the list.  Perhaps the witness could spell the other name that he mentioned.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please do, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Mugesera, M-U-G-E-S-E-R-A, for Mugesera. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Witness, did you mention another name? 
A.	I also referred to Karim.
Q.	Is that K-A-R-I-M?  
A.	Yes, correct.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
But from the interpreters, Kinyarwanda booth, there is a U at the end of that, Karimu.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And these two persons came from where?  
THE WITNESS:
They both were natives of Bucyogo secteur.
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you see anyone else you recognised at PDK -- at the préfecture office when you arrived? 
A.	I recognised Ruberangondo, who was the bourgmestre of Butamwe commune.  I was also to recognise André Karekezi, who arrived shortly after me, and I was able to recognise others, as well, including Conseiller Stanis, who was the conseiller of a secteur whose name I don't remember.  I was also able to recognise Mbyareyehe, conseiller from Kigali secteur.  And I just recall that Stanis, who was conseiller from Gitega, who was a neighbouring secteur to Bijobo (phonetic).
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now we have to clarify all these names and all these locations, so Stanis was number 199, I understand.
MS. MELLUISH:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you have to help us with the rest.
MS. MELLUISH:
Unfortunately the others don't appear on the list.
MS. MELLUISH:
Ruberangondo, R-U-B-E-R-A-N-G --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, if counsel would slow down.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Whenever we spell and whenever we read we go to half speed.
MS. MELLUISH:
Sorry, R-U-B-E-R-A-N-G-O-N-D-O. And the commune, Butamwa, B-U-T-A-M-W-A, and I'm afraid the name I noted as Mbyareyehe will have to be spelled by the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please do, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Mbyareyehe is spelled M-D-Y-A-R-I-Y-H-E (sic), Mbyareyehe.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have we now got both the bourgmestre and the commune?  
MS. MELLUISH:
I believe so. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Perhaps, Mr. Witness, could you repeat the bourgmestre Mbyareyehe was bourgmestre of which commune? 
A.	No, Mbyareyehe was a conseiller, conseiller of one of the secteurs in Kigali town but it is Ruberangondo who was bourgmestre of Butamwa commune. 
Q.	And do you know which secteur Mdyariyhe was conseiller for? 
A.	I do not recall the exact name of the secteur, but it was one of the secteurs in the centre of the city. 
Q.	Thank you.  

You mentioned seeing soldiers at the préfecture office.  Did you see any senior military officers there?  
A.	Yes, there were senior military officers as well as junior officers, but I was not able to know all their names. 
Q.	Can you tell us what you observed the people at the préfecture office to be doing when you arrived? 
A.	When I arrived there, I did not notice anything special happening.  People stood in groups of two or three discussing issues among themselves and talking about the war, and most of them were saying that President Habyarimana had died, and they talked about those who purportedly had killed him.  In fact, the only topic of conversation was the war.  Thereafter people went back to their offices.  I didn't go with them because that was not my business. 
Q.	So, what did you do? 
A.	I did not do anything.  I waited for some time and after a while Colonel Renzaho came out and called for some policemen.  He asked them to go to Kimisagara.  Colonel Tharcisse Renzaho entered his vehicle and we followed him.  When we got to Radio Rwanda he went to his home (sic) and the policeman who was with me said, "we should go on to look for " - 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And the witness doesn't complete his sentence.
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Perhaps if I can ask you to slow down a bit.  You mentioned Colonel Renzaho.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Who asked them to go to a location and the name was?  
MS. MELLUISH:
91 on the spelling list.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Kimisagara and where did he come out of?  
THE WITNESS:
Renzaho came out of his office.  Then he took off and we followed.  When we got to Radio Rwanda he went into the premises of the radio station and the policeman who was with me said, "We should go on to Kimisagara to look for Conseiller Rose Karushara, who was the conseiller of Kimisagara secteur.
MS. MELLUISH:
Karushara is at 83.
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'd like to take you back to the préfecture office.  When you first saw Colonel Renzaho, can you tell us how he was dressed? 
A.	He was in military gear and usually he would not wear military uniforms but on that day he was wearing his military uniform, but I knew him previously. 
Q.	Can you tell us how you knew him previously? 
A.	I got to know him during meetings.  I had the opportunity of seeing him face to face, even though those meetings have no relationship with this trial.  

I wonder, Mr. President, if I'm allowed to talk about those meetings.  If you grant me leave, then I'm going to tell you how I got to know him.  It was towards late 1993 during a meeting which he chaired, which meeting had taken place in Nyarungenge office where his office was during the war.  Should I move on?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What we want to know now is how you knew Mr. Renzaho.  We do not want details about previous incidents at this stage.  So when did you first see him, was that in 1983, yes or no?  Was that the first time?  
THE WITNESS:
I first saw him in 1993 and on the 7th when I arrived at his office I saw him again. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Had you seen him between 1983 and the 7th of April 1994?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness is correcting that it was in 1993, not 1983.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So are you saying that it was not in 1983 but in 1993?  Is that when you first saw him, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Actually I had known him even before but it was in 1993 that I came into close contact with him because he was just in front of me.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you want to pursue this, Prosecution?  
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, no, I was going to move.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well then, when did you first see him ever in your life?  
THE WITNESS:
The first time I saw him was during a meeting which he had organised and it was around late 1993.  He was the préfet of Kigali-ville préfecture.  And I saw him for the second time in 1994 on that 7th.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you saw him once in 1993 and the second time you ever saw him was in the 7th of April 1994.  Is that how we are going to understand your evidence or is that an incorrect summary?  Mr. Witness, don't talk while I'm talking.  We are trying to ensure that you and I communicate efficiently now.  So what is your evidence.  Just listen to the question.
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, what you are saying is correct.  I saw him in late 1993, then I saw him again on that 7th of the year 1994, that morning.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	And when Renzaho came out of his office, did you recognise him? 
A.	Yes, I did.  You see, on account of his office in that préfecture and given that I was a *******, I could not be unaware of Renzaho, whom I had seen many times.  But as I clearly stated, I saw him at close range for the first time during that meeting in 1993. 
Q.	And when Renzaho came out of his office, can you tell us, step-by-step, please, what he did? 
A.	If I have to tell you what he did in chronological order, he came out of his office, then we headed toward the Rwandan radio station.  He got on the premises of the radio station, but we continued toward Kimisagara because, as I said, the policeman said we had to go look for the Rose Karushara.  So we picked Rose Karushara from her home and went to the préfecture office. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, why did you follow Renzaho? 
A.	I did not follow him.  We simply left the préfecture office almost at the same time and we were driving behind him.  So, there were four policemen.  **********************.  The policeman was with me asked me to continue to Kimisagara, so we went on the Gakinjro road.  We passed in front of the prison and we went to Kimisagara at the residence of Conseiller Rose Karushara.
JUDGE EGOROV:
Let me ask you, do you remember approximately at what time Mr. Renzaho entered the radio station building?  
THE WITNESS:
He entered the Radio Rwandan premises around 9:30 because we came back to the préfecture office around 10 a.m.
JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The name of the road?  
MS. MELLUISH:
I'm sorry, I don't think I caught it.
THE WITNESS:
I no longer remember the name of that street but I can describe the road leading to Radio Rwanda, and I think that you yourself can consult a map and you are able to locate that street.  You will see the various points of access to Radio Rwanda.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, did you say in a previous answer that you went to a narrow road and that narrow road had a name?  

THE WITNESS:
No, it was not a small street.  It was a tarmac road.  It's a road passing through Gakinjro and goes down to Kigali main prison commonly referred to as the 1930 prison.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, help us with that name, please, someone.  Can you spell that name before the 1930 prison?  I think that was the one you referred to in your previous answer.
THE WITNESS:
I'm mentioned Gakinjro, Mr. President.  It is not the official name of that street, it is a neighbourhood which is commonly known as Gakinjro.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that's useful to know, but, you see, whenever a name is mentioned in this Court we need to make sure that when we read the transcripts later that we got it correctly spelled.  So, if you would kindly help us with that now.  Could you please spell this name which you have referred to a few times?  Will you do that, please?  
THE WITNESS:
So you want me to tell spell it?  Well, if I could be handed a pen.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's not on the spelling list, is it?  
MS. MELLUISH:
I'm sorry, Your Honours, it isn't.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We seem to need a revised spelling list for tomorrow morning.
MS. MELLUISH:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you read out that spelling?  Your handwriting is very clear, but I think you may be in a better position to read it.
THE WITNESS:
G-A-K-I-N-J-R-O.  Is it correct? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness is asking.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, we'll leave it at that.
THE WITNESS:
So this is Gakinjro.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Keep the paper and pen there.  He may need that if other names are referred to.  

What is the next question?
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Witness, you said you travelled behind Renzaho's vehicle to Radio Rwanda.  Can you tell us what type of vehicle Renzaho was in? 
A.	It was a Renault. 
Q.	Was he alone or with somebody else? 
A.	He was with his military driver. 
Q.	And you yourself in your vehicle, was there anyone else with you? 
A.	I was with four commune policemen. 
Q.	And if you could just clarify for us, please, who gave the instruction to travel to Rose Karushara's house? 
A.	****************** instruction from the policeman who, himself, had been instructed by Colonel Renzaho. 
Q.	Can you tell us, please, what happened when you got to Rose Karushara's house? 
A.	When we arrived there, one of the policemen went to see her to tell her that the préfet needed to see her.  So she got out of her home and mounted the vehicle and we drove back to the préfecture office. 
Q.	And when you were at her house, did you notice anything unusual? 
A.	What was unusual was a roadblock which had been erected in front of her house. 
Q.	Was this roadblock manned? 
A.	Yes, it was manned by Interahamwe.
MR. PRESIDENT:
This Rose Karushara, is that a man or a lady?  
THE WITNESS:
A lady, Mr. President.
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	And do you know, Mr. Witness, whether Rose Karushara had any political affiliation at that time? 
A.	She was a member of the MRND, just as the others were also members of that same party, but she was a very active member of that party. 
Q.	And what do you mean by "very active member"?  
A.	She was a personality well-known within that party.  She was trusted by the préfet.  I think I should point out here that the préfet did not trust many of his conseillers, but I should say that he particularly trusted Rose Karushara.  Should I move on?  
Q.	You said you collected Rose Karushara from her house and you travelled back to the préfecture.  Can you tell us what happened when you got back to the préfecture? 
A.	When we arrived, the conseillers and bourgmestre I mentioned earlier on, went out and we loaded firearms into the vehicle.  Then we took Rose Karushara to her home.  When we arrived at her home, we sat down for some time and she gave us drinks.  Afterwards we went back to the préfecture office. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, if we could take this a little more slowly, please.  You said first you loaded weapons into the vehicle.  From where did these weapons come? 
A.	I think I left out something.  When we arrived at the préfecture office in the company of Rose, a policeman went and informed the préfet that she had arrived.  So Tharcisse Renzaho came out of his office and then we went to the Hotel Diplomate, which was located a few metres from Camp Kigali.  When we arrived at Hotel Diplomate she got out of the vehicle.  We saw many soldiers at that place.  And I should point out that they were officers.  I was subsequently told by the policeman that among the people we saw present was Mr. Kabiligi.  So they entered the Hotel Diplomate premises, then they came out.  Subsequently, they asked the policeman and soldiers present there to accompany them.  They took out the weapons which were in the building and loaded them *************.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we need to do this step-by-step.  Now, first of all, ************* behind Renzaho's car to Radio Rwanda then you continued to Rose's house.  Is that true, yes or no?
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.  We continued to Rose Karushara's home.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What did Renzaho do when you continued to Rose's house?  Where was he when you left 
Radio Rwanda?  
THE WITNESS:
When we went back to the préfecture office Renzaho was already there.  We found him there.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does this mean that Renzaho, after having entered the Rwanda radio premises, he did not drive with his car together with you to Rose's house?  
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.  He did not go with us to Rose's home.  He entered the radio premises and we continued away just by ourselves.  By the time we returned to the préfecture office he was there.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, to the loading of the weapons, you said they were loaded in the car.  Were they loaded **************************  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, they were loaded in the car ******************.
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Can you just clarify, please, witness, where you were when you first saw these weapons? 
A.	I was seated on the vehicle ****************.  It was parked in front of the Hotel Diplomate building.  I did not go out **************. 
Q.	And was Renzaho there at Hotel Diplomate? 
A.	Yes, he was personally present at Hotel de Diplomate.  He was the one who went into the premises.  He saw those soldiers, they greeted one another and, subsequently, entered the building, then the soldiers came out with those weapons, which they loaded on the vehicle. 
Q.	And did you recognise any of the other soldiers, apart from that? 
A.	No, apart from the one identified as Kabiligi, and I must say that I did not personally know him, by the way.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Who is this Kabiligi, Mr. Witness?  What was his position in society in 1994?  
THE WITNESS:
I was unaware of his position, but he was a senior officer and certainly that was the reason why his name was mentioned.  But even if I saw him, I was unaware of his position.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The first time you saw these weapons were when they were loaded ************** at Hotel Diplomate, is that the evidence?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Can you tell us what weapons they were? 
A.	Kindly repeat your question, please.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, if counsel can repeat her question.
THE WITNESS:
Actually, I'm not a soldier, but I saw the weapons and among the weapons were Kalashnikov guns.  There were other weapons which had already been used and we could see that they were not new.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the question the witness seemed to understand was, "can you tell us what weapons they were?"  

And here is the next question.
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Can you recall how many weapons there were? 
A.	There were many weapons, because they made several rotations, but approximately -- I would say there were about 100, however, personally, I did not count them. 
Q.	And beside the weapons you described, was anything else loaded **************? 
A.	Yes, they also loaded cases of ammunition into that vehicle. 
Q.	And after the weapons and ammunition were loaded ***************, do you know what Renzaho did? 
A.	After that we went to the préfecture office.  The weapons and ammunition were offloaded and taken to the office.  The first person I saw carrying some of those weapons and ammunition was 
	Conseiller Karushara because the weapons were loaded ******************** and we ferried them to the house.  And I imagine that other conseillers also received weapons and ammunitions.  I can't think that they left without having received some of the weapons and ammunitions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
When did you receive the weapons at the hotel?  What time was it?  
THE WITNESS:
It was around 10 a.m., because we had just returned from Kimisagara, and I had already said we left the préfecture office a few minutes after nine o'clock heading for Kimisagara.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you arrived at the préfecture office when, after having been at the hotel?  
THE WITNESS:
Around ten o'clock or a few minutes after ten o'clock.  It is just an approximation when I look at the time it took for us to make the trips from the various points, I think it was around ten o'clock, because I remember I had left my home around seven o'clock, that is early in the morning.
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	You said that you took the weapons from the hotel back to the préfecture office and that they were unloaded there, but I think you then said that weapons were loaded back *********************.  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes, after the stock destined for Rose Karushara had been set aside, that weapons stock which had to be handed over to Rose Karushara was then loaded *****************. 
Q.	And do you recall how many weapons were part of the stock for Rose Karushara? 
A.	Yes, I do remember. 
Q.	Can you tell us, please? 
A.	Not more than ten. 
Q.	And when those weapons were loaded ***************** a second time, where was Rose Karushara? 
A.	She was still inside the office at the préfet's office with the other conseillers. 
Q.	Did she come out? 
A.	Yes, she came out and entered the vehicle, but first of all she asked the policeman whether the weapons had been loaded into the vehicle, and the policemen confirmed that.  She verified and then we went on the Kimisagara.
MR. PRESIDENT:
She entered which vehicle?  
THE WITNESS:
*************************************.  She did not enter the préfet's vehicle.  She entered the vehicle ******************.
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	And at that time do you know what the préfet was doing? 
A.	No, I have no idea.  I was not in a position to know. 
Q.	Can you tell us what happened when you got to Rose Karushara's house with those weapons? 
A.	The weapons were offloaded and placed in Rose's living room, in that very room where she had received us and served us some drinks. 
Q.	Who offloaded the weapons? 
A.	They were offloaded by the policemen. 
Q.	And do you know what happened to the weapons after they were offloaded into the living room? 
A.	The Interahamwe came at their own behest, entered the living room of the conseiller, who told them that she was going to distribute weapons.  In fact, she had already begun distributing them before we left, five weapons had already been handed to Interahamwe who were manning the roadblock. 
Q.	Where were you when this happened? 
A.	I was sitting in Rose Karushara's living room.  As I have already told you, when we arrived she served some beer and when we finished drinking what she had offered us, then we left and took off. 
Q.	And after you took off, where did you go to? 
A.	We went back to Nyamirambo and then on to the centre of town on our way to the préfectural office.  When I arrived at the préfectural office a policeman handed me ************************, which had been signed by Préfet Colonel Tharcisse Renzaho.  And then he told me to go home and return the next day in the morning.  So I went back ******************, as I usually did.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was Renzaho present in the hotel when the weapons were loaded *****************?
THE WITNESS:
He was inside with the soldiers, then he came out and entered his vehicle driving in front of us.  We followed him straight to the préfectural office without any stops.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And when you went to Rose's house with weapons in order to offload them in the living room, Renzaho remained in his office or did he accompany you in the direction of Rose's house?  
THE WITNESS:
No, the préfet was not with us when we went to Rose's house.
JUDGE EGOROV:
Who ordered you to go to this Rose's house, not to any other place?  
THE WITNESS:
We had been instructed to go fetch Rose from her home and we were under instructions to take her back to her home, as well.  So we had taken her to the préfectural office, where she received the weapons, and, of course, some instructions, as well.  And thereafter we took her back home.  Things couldn't have happened otherwise.  The person who gave me orders was the policeman who was in my company.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did the policeman instruct you to go and fetch Rose from her home?  Is that where the order came from?  
THE WITNESS:
The policeman received instructions from the préfet, who was standing next to him.  It is the préfet who told the policeman that we should follow him.  I thought that we were going to follow him into the radio house, but then we took another road leading to Kimisagara.  So the policemen were receiving orders from the préfet because they could not act on their own behest.
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Now, you said that you received a laissez passer and you were told to report to the préfecture office the following day, is that right?  
A.	Correct.
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, we did not hear the witness mention a laissez passer, the reference in French was made as (French spoken) which is a *******************.  Are we talking about the same thing here?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What kind of document were you given, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
It was an authorisation which allowed ***************************************************************** 
************************************
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	But you said that you received that relatively late in the day, after you had travelled to Rose's house via Radio Rwanda to Hotel Diplomat and to the préfecture office.  Can you tell the Court please how you managed to travel freely all day before you received ***************************? 
A.	***************************************************************************************** and the Interahamwe could not stop policemen whom they could see, particularly as they drove around in a state-owned vehicle and not a private vehicle.  It was impossible for the Interahamwe to stop policemen, and the reason for which **************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************.
MR. PRESIDENT:
This other authorisation, had that been signed on the same date or the same occasion as the first travel authorisation you referred to or previously?  
THE WITNESS:
That first authorisation was issued at the beginning of the war in 1990 because I was a member of the cellule committee, and it was at that time we were issued those authorisations.  Other members of the population had been forbidden or prohibited from travelling around.  I'm sure the préfet knows what I am talking about because he is the one who issued those authorisations.
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Did you have any difficulty travelling around Kigali, as you did on the 7th of April?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before the document was issued?  
MS. MELLUISH:
At any stage.
THE WITNESS:
Not at all.
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Can we move, Mr. Witness, to the following day, the 8th of April, and can you tell us what you did first thing in the morning? 
A.	On the 8th of April I went back to the préfectural office arriving at the office at around 7 a.m., and I remained there till 2 p.m.  Obviously I had to have lunch, so I was absent for a while, then I came back at around 2 p.m., and at that time the préfet came out of his office and he talked to some policemen asking them to follow him.  We left the préfectural office driving along the same road that goes by 
	Radio Rwanda and Gakinjro and the 1930 prison then we went right up to Kimisagara.  Can I proceed?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We need the spellings first.  Can you help us, Prosecution?
MS. MELLUISH:
I believe all those words have been spelt already.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take your word for it.
THE WITNESS:
May I proceed?  Well, we were with the préfet and we arrived at Rose Karushara's house.  She was at the roadblock herself, that is Madam Conseiller, herself, was at the roadblock, and she talked to the préfet, who was still in his vehicle.  When the Interahamwe saw the préfet they gathered around him.  He talked to them, asked them how they were doing and told them to continue to work.  Some people were sitting on the ground at that location, people who had been arrested at that roadblock.
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Firstly, can you tell the Court what you understood by the préfet telling the Interahamwe to continue to "work"? 
A.	The word "work" meant "kill", and that is what it meant.  When he said "work", he meant "kill".  He wasn't asking them to do any other kind of work.  He was asking them to kill.  So, when we left that location, you will understand that they continued to work as the préfet had asked them to do. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, you mentioned some people sitting on the ground near this roadblock.  Do you know who they were? 
A.	No, I did not know them, but I believe that they were Tutsi, given that they were the ones who were being looked for.  The Hutu had no problem, and it is for that reason that I believe it is Tutsi who were sitting at that location. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, what makes you say that you believe that the Tutsi were the people who were being looked for and that Hutu had no problem? 
A.	I say that because generally speaking, it is the Tutsi who were being looked for, or maybe the Hutu were not bothered, so, in a group of 100, if there was one Hutu, you cannot assign much weight to that.  So, to my mind, I think that they were looking for Tutsi, because it is the Tutsi that were, indeed, killed. 
Q.	Can you tell us, if you are able, how the Interahamwe that gathered around Renzaho behaved towards him? 
A.	They were happy when they saw him, and he was also happy and it is at that point that he told them to work.  Renzaho himself made that statement.  He used that word, "work".  Colonel Renzaho used that term, that word "work" for the first time in Rwanda. 
Q.	And at that time, Mr. Witness, were the Interahamwe that you saw there armed? 
A.	Yes, they were armed.  You may want to recall that weapons had been distributed to them on the 7th, and it is those weapons that they were carrying, but some had clubs and machetes and knives. 
Q.	And are you able to estimate how many Interahamwe there were? 
A.	Many of them.  I could not count, but there might have been 20 or 30 or thereabouts. 
Q.	Did you hear any other discussion other than what you told us between Renzaho and those Interahamwe at that time? 
A.	I did not hear anything else, except the request for more weapons.  And you would understand those who had machetes and clubs also wanted to be given guns.  He told them that he would be able to do so. 
Q.	And after telling them that, what did Renzaho do? 
A.	We continued to travel towards the Nyakabanda secteur, which was not far away from there.  There was another roadblock at that location manned by Interahamwe.  The conseiller was also present and he also stopped at that roadblock.  He asked -- or he talked to the conseiller and the Interahamwe.  A similar request for guns was also made to the préfet.  Interahamwe at the roadblock had some guns and he promised to get more for them.  Then we went on toward Nyamirambo near to Josephied Brothers monastery.  Some Interahamwe were present at that location and two Josephied Brothers in robes were also present.  He didn't spend much time at that location because there was a Red Cross vehicle not far away from that location and people were making some pictures, so he did not spend much time at that location.  He did not talk to anybody.  We went back to town and when we got near Club Raffiki at the Nyamirambo brigade we stopped there and there was a roadblock manned by Interahamwe and gendarmes.  There were some dead bodies at that roadblock.  People had just been killed at that roadblock.  So we went from Club Raffiki to the mosque near to Red Cross.  At that location there was another roadblock and there were many Interahamwe at that roadblock.  Then we went on to Gitega and many people had been killed at Gitega as well.  He saw Conseiller Estane (phonetic) of Gitega secteur at Gitega.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What was the name of the conseiller at Nyakabanda?  
THE WITNESS:
I did not know the name of the conseiller of Nyakabanda.  He had just replaced Kandekwe (phonetic).  He was a new official and I did not know his name.  So, when we got to Gitega, the Interahamwe asked for a vehicle to enable them to carry away the dead bodies that were strewn around that area.  Then we went through Camp Kigali back to the préfecture arriving at the préfecture office at about 3 p.m., and then I went home.  That is how the day unfolded, that is thereafter noon from 2 p.m.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the first name of Kandekwe?  
THE WITNESS:
Emmanuel Kandekwe.  It is not Kanyandekwe, Kandekwe.
MR. PRESIDENT:
At 78 there is a spelling mistake, K-A-N-D-E-K-W-E, is that the correct spelling?  
THE WITNESS:
Correct.
(Pages 73 to 88 by R. Lear)




















1630H 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you've described visiting a number of roadblocks.  Could you tell us what the purpose, as you understood it, of your afternoon's travels was?  
A.	I did not have any discussion with the préfet, but to my mind he was checking on the use to which those weapons that had been distributed were being put.  You would understand that there was no request for guns in Gitega.  All they asked for was a vehicle to take away the bodies -- the several bodies that were lying in that area.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, to go back to the beginning of your trip, at the roadblock at Nyakabanda, was there a discussion between Renzaho and anyone else about weapons? 
A.	In Nyakabanda, the Interahamwe requested more guns, because they did not have enough.  But I think that some guns had also been distributed to civilians because there were certain people who were killed in their homes, not necessarily at the roadblocks.  
Q.	Were you able to see whether the people manning the roadblock at Nyakabanda actually had weapons when you visited?  
A.	They had guns.  
Q.	And at -- at Nyamirambo, you said that the préfet didn't stop for long.  Can you describe in a little more detail what you saw at that roadblock?  
A.	There were dead bodies near a place where a Red Cross vehicle was picking up injured persons as well as bodies.  
Q.	And were you able to recognise any of the injured or dead?  
A.	No, I did not make out anybody.  I simply saw dead bodies.  We did not spend more than one minute at that place; I did not have time to look around.  
Q.	Now, the next roadblock that you went to, can you recall who was manning that?  
A.	That roadblock was manned by gendarmeries and Interahamwe.  It was at the Nyamirambo brigade, close to Rafiki club. 
Q.	And were the people manning that roadblock armed?  
A.	Yes.  At that roadblock, the gendarmes had guns, but the other persons manning the roadblock had machetes and clubs. 
Q.	And did you stop at that roadblock?  
A.	No, we simply slowed down.  I think he was afraid of being photographed, because there were whites in the Red Cross vehicle who were taking snapshots. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
At which roadblock are you now, when you are saying this?  
THE WITNESS: 
I am referring to the Nyamirambo roadblock at the St André college in the St Lwanga parish.  It was close to the road leading to the St André college and the Charles Lwanga church.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So your reference to the guns, namely that:  "The gendarmes had guns but the other persons had machetes and clubs," that sentence referred to which roadblock?  
THE WITNESS: 
The roadblock at the Rafiki club, opposite the Petrorwanda petrol station.  But currently that petrol station's name has changed.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The road the Interahamwe (Microphones overlapping). 
THE WITNESS: 
No, the préfet simply spoke to the gendarmes.  I don't know what he told him. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
At the Rafiki club, the Interahamwe had no guns, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS: 
They did not have guns.  
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Did you see any dead bodies near this roadblock?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, there were dead bodies.  Three bodies by the road.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Mr. Witness, the next roadblock that you referred to earlier was at ONATRACOM; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, there was a roadblock at ONATRACOM, near the Red Cross building and it was near the road leading to Camp Kigali.  But at that time, that road was not being used.  We are still in Gitega secteur, so there were two roadblocks in that secteur.  There was one roadblock at ONATRACOM near the mosque.  There was another one near the Gitega secteur office, and it was at that roadblock that there were many dead bodies.  So those who were able to pass through the ONATRACOM roadblock could not at all pass through the Gitega roadblock.  I am referring to the Tutsi here.  They stood no chance of passing through the Gitega roadblock.  
Q.	At the first of those, the ONATRACOM roadblock, did Renzaho stop?  
A.	Yes, he stopped and spoke to the people who were there.  He repeated the same instructions.  He asked them to work.  Those people were very happy and Renzaho, too, had changed.  He told them to work.  He repeated the same thing at that roadblock.  And those manning that roadblock had guns. 
Q.	And what kind of people were they, who manned that roadblock?  
A.	On the 7th, there were soldiers there.  But subsequently that roadblock was manned by Interahamwe.  On the 8th there were Interahamwe there.  Even at the second roadblock there were Interahamwe.  I am referring to the two roadblocks located in Gitega secteur.  
Q.	And the second roadblock at Gitega secteur, did Renzaho stop there?  
A.	Yes, he stopped there because the people manning that roadblock had asked that he place a vehicle at their disposal to remove the bodies of victims.  Because there were lots of bodies there, and those people had to be buried.  Following their request, Préfet Renzaho promised to avail them with a vehicle.  
Q.	Are you able to estimate how many bodies there were at that roadblock?  
A.	Actually, I did not count the bodies.  There were lots of them.  One could see bodies everywhere; the bodies were visible.  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honour, I wonder if a copy of these photographs could be provided to the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This is the bunch that you asked us to mark, but which we agreed simply to remember?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could you do that, please?  Do you have it, registry?  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Mr. Witness, that is a booklet of photographs.  I would ask you to look at the first photograph, which is numbered 1 in the bottom corner -- 
MS. MELLUISH: 
But I see my learned friend has risen.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, this is indeed what the Defence was fearing.  Those are photographs which have not yet been authenticated.  I do not know whether it is only for illustrative purposes, without any weight whatsoever, that my learned friend is putting them to the witness.  But it was made known clearly here that it was a witness who claimed to have taken the photographs in 1994 who would come and testify about that to us.  I do not see how through this witness we can start examining those photographs through other witnesses.  So we object to the production of that photograph in the course of this witness's testimony. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What we are discussing now is whether a document can be put to a witness as part of examination, and there counsel for both sides have a wide discretion as long as it is relevant.  We will follow this and see whether it's relevant.  But in order to know the answer, we need to know what this is about.  

Now, this document you are referring to, does it have a K number?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
A K number, yes, that appears at the top.  And on the bottom of some of the -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, but are you asking the witness for any particular photo with a particular K number, and if so, which one?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, I found it easier, Your Honour, to refer to the number in the bottom right-hand corner.  But if Your Honour prefers I can use the K numbers. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right, you are referring to the number at the bottom.  With other words, the first one which is K0376701.  

What is your question in connection with this photo to this witness?  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you recognise the contents of this photograph at all?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, have you ever seen this photograph before?  Let me ask it that way.  
THE WITNESS: 
It is the first time I am seeing this picture, Mr. President.  It is my first time of seeing this picture here in this courtroom.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you have not been shown it, in connection with your preparatory discussions, by the Prosecution?  
THE WITNESS: 
No, sir.  That photograph was not shown me.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And then the question was, this photograph, which you say you've not seen it before, do you recognise the contents on that photograph?  
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, that photograph confirms that what I was saying is the truth.  The first proof is the loading of dead bodies, as we have in this photograph.  I don't know when that photograph was taken.  That is the date.  But I think it was not before our passage, which I described, and that is the Gitega roadblock.  

Regarding the previous (sic) photograph, it is the roadblock at ONATRACOM.  So I have identified the two roadblocks.  When a person passes through the roadblock located in front of ONATRACOM, that same person stood no chance of going through the roadblock which was at the Gitega secteur office.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please, Mr. Witness, hold on.  Hold on.  This is not clear.  

This photograph, what leads you to say that it is linked to any particular roadblock?  The first photograph marked 1 at the right-hand bottom.  

THE WITNESS: 
The reason is that on that photograph I can see people whom I saw at that roadblock.  I am unable to give names, but I know at least three people that I saw at that roadblock whose faces I recognise on this photograph.  And I am also able to recognise the garbage disposal mechanism which was located there.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Monsieur le President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What do you mean by "that roadblock"?  Which one are you referring to?  
THE WITNESS: 
I said there were two roadblocks.  The first roadblock was located in front of ONATRACOM when you are heading in the direction of the Gitega secteur office.  And it was at the second roadblock where that garbage disposal mechanism I referred to a while ago was located.  But I cannot recognise the other places where the photographs were taken.  Otherwise I can recognise the road leading to the Gitega secteur office.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So which roadblock is this?  Are you referring to the Gitega roadblock now?  
THE WITNESS: 
The place on that photograph is of the second roadblock.  I mentioned two roadblocks.  The first one located in front of the ONATRACOM offices, and the second roadblock, which was located at the secteur office of Gitega.  And I am unable (sic) to recognise that second roadblock because of the garbage disposal can, the huge garbage disposal can which was there.  Because in the days following my first passage there, I was able to recognise the huge garbage disposal can, and it was located at that roadblock.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, try to answer this more briefly, will you, Mr. Witness?  You see, we have heard your testimony and listened very carefully.  The last sentence we have now is that you were unable to recognise the garbage, so it couldn't be the second roadblock.  What are you saying?  Is that the correct translation?  Is this the Gitega roadblock, or is it the ONATRACOM roadblock?  
THE WITNESS: 
There was a first roadblock located at ONATRACOM.  I have already referred to it.  Then there was a second roadblock located at the Gitega secteur office.  At the first roadblock, there was no garbage disposal can.  In fact, there was no dead body, even. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay, yes, all right.  You see, we have heard you say three times that there were two roadblocks you referred to, and that is exactly the problem.  So with other words, what this is referring to, according to you, is then the second roadblock, namely, the one at the Gitega secteur office; is that your evidence?  This is not the ONATRACOM roadblock; is that what you are trying to convey to us?  Or do we get it wrong?  Just tell me the name of this roadblock; which roadblock is this?  Don't mention many roadblocks.  Only the name of this one, according to you.  Please.  
THE WITNESS: 
The roadblock on the first photograph was located at the Gitega secteur office.  And that is where there were many people, and it was at that place that the préfet was requested to place a vehicle at their disposal to carry away dead bodies.  That was the roadblock which had been set up at the Gitega secteur office.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And this was also where the garbage place was; true?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, quite so.  That garbage can was located at the Gitega secteur office. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, Prosecution, what is this photograph?  What is its provenance?  Where does it come from?  When was it taken?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Well, Your Honour, we will be calling Witness BUX to provide detailed information about that.  But this photograph was taken by the witness, BUX, who was in Kigali in -- I'm not sure of the precise date, but May 1994.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  And then we will hear what BUX is saying about this.  

What is your next question?  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	I believe, Mr. Witness, that earlier you said that after visiting the Gitega secteur roadblock, you returned to PVK.  Is that a correct recollection?  
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And when you returned to PVK, what did you do?  
A.	When we arrived at the préfecture office, I did not do anything else.  Since the person I was addressing myself to was the communal policeman, I asked him if I could return home, and indeed, I left around 3 p.m.  
Q.	And had you seen Renzaho again after being with him at the roadblock at Gitega secteur office?  
A.	We were driving behind him up to the Kigali-ville préfecture office.  Mr. Renzaho entered his -- at his office, and I asked the policeman if I could return home.  And he said yes, so I left.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, during the course of the afternoon when you were with Renzaho, can you tell us, please, whether he had any difficulty travelling around Kigali?  

MR. NEKUIE: 
Objection, Mr. President.  We consider this question leading.  If the witness has to mention the difficulties in the travels made by Renzaho whom he was accompanying, he would have said so spontaneously.  I do not think that it is time now to suggest to him any difficulties Mr. Renzaho may have encountered.  That is why we object to this question.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's open ended, but more specific.  Your remark goes to weight.  

Can you answer the question, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I can answer the question.  For the Defence to claim that the question is leading -- I think that if I were to answer before counsel stood up, I would have said that the préfet did not have any difficulty.  Mr. Renzaho was the préfet of Kigali-ville préfecture; he was an army colonel in the Rwandan army.  No one could object to him passing through.  Not the policeman could impede the movement of the préfet, who Renzaho was the representative of the entire administration, as well as the ministry of the interior.  No one in that préfecture had more authority than him.  No one could have impeded Renzaho's free movement.  

Otherwise let me repeat that I will answer only questions put by the Prosecutor without going beyond, and I am of the view that the Prosecutor's question was not at all leading.  The Prosecutor is entitled to know whether Préfet Renzaho had any difficulties moving about.  And I am saying that he could not encounter such a difficulty because he was a préfet.  And even more so, he was an army colonel.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  Your view on this is noted.  

Next question?  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	And are you able to comment at all on the attitude, as you saw it, of Renzaho during the course of that afternoon?  
A.	He had not changed; he remained Renzaho.  He spoke to the Interahamwe and he promised to fulfil their needs.  But he wished that they should continue working.  He did not prohibit the Interahamwe from killing.  All what he told them was to kill.  He never prohibited them from killing.  Rather, he told them to work, and he himself knew the meaning of that word gukura.  He can explain to you whether gukura would have meant to go and work the fields.  That is what I know regarding the person who was a préfet of Kigali-ville.  I think I have nothing else to say regarding his attitude, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And we all agree that gukura is G-U-K-U-R-A; isn't that so?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  Where are you in your examination-in-chief now, Prosecution?  How much is left, approximately?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
I think I am three-quarters of the way through, Your Honour, if that's helpful.  I'm not sure how long -- what time is it now?  It may be another hour, or an hour-and-a-half.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's 5 o'clock.  We will then stop for today.  The next witness after the cross-examination of the present witness, can you confirm that that will be UL?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  If you use approximately one hour tomorrow morning, from 8:45 to 9:45, not more, is there an indication by the Defence how long the cross-examination will take?  We are simply asking because we need to know whether we should call the next witness before lunch or after the lunch break.  That's the purpose of the question.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, we think it would be preferable for the Chamber to call the next witness after the lunch break, because we think we have a significant number of questions to put to this witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So if we ask that witness to arrive from 2:30 onwards, that would be a reasonable estimate?  Then he will not have to wait in the morning, but he will be entering the courtroom sometime in the afternoon.  That's how I understand you.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Quite so, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Witness, we will continue your testimony tomorrow morning at 8:45.  Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  

Is there anything of an administrative nature we need to deal with now?  If not, we will then adjourn until tomorrow.  Thank you.  
(Court adjourned at 1702H)
