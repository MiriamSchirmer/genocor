MR. PRESIDENT:
You have a document in front of you there, Mr. Witness, with your signature, isn't that so?

MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, that is correct, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any comments? 
MR. MOSES:
No, I just wanted to alert Your Honours to the fact that the Prosecution has an application to make regarding the scope of this witness's testimony which I wish to argue before we commence the evidence-in-chief.  I've alerted my friends to this fact and I think the application will also need to be made in closed session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's noted.  We will then move into closed session.

WITNESS MAJ,
first having been duly sworn,
 testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Good morning.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, could you tell the Court what is your age? 
A.	On 13th of September, I'll be 55.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, are you Hutu or Tutsi? 
A.	I had an identity card with the word "Hutu" on it, but I do not consider myself a Hutu.  My mother was Hutu --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We did not get the father's identity, Mr. President, because there was a disruption.  
THE WITNESS:
I'm a product of a mixed marriage, and I had the -- the -- so I used the information on the identity card of my father who brought me up.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, have you testified before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda? 
A.	Yes, I testified before the ICTR in February 1998.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
There was a slight interruption in the English version.  So was it your testimony, then, Mr. Witness that your father was a Hutu and your mother a Tutsi, is that the situation?  We didn't hear you clearly. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I'll repeat:  My father -- my biological father did not raise me.  My biological father's ethnicity is not on my identity card at that time.  I used an identity card with the word "Hutu" on it, and that's what I explained, and I did that because there was no other possibility in that regard. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So your biological father, was he a Hutu or a Tutsi, just for the record? 
THE WITNESS:
My biological father was a Tutsi.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
But he never brought me up. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And your biological mother, what was her ethnicity? 
THE WITNESS:
She was Hutu.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you were young, did you experience any injustice which you can tell us briefly about? 
A.	Yes, my first unpleasant experience was at the Kigali official college, which is in Mburabuturo, in February 1973, where there were ethnic problems at the college where I was -- in 1963, I beg your pardon.  So what I did was to try and protect my colleagues, particularly my Tutsi colleagues who were in my dormitory.  The dormitory had appropriately four people -- approximately four people:  There were two Hutus and two Tutsis.  

Unfortunately, our Tutsi colleagues were compelled to leave the college.  At that time, that struck me so much, that I personally also left the school.  This is how I stopped school at 19 -- in 1973, and looked for work.  And I was employed at the ********************************. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, this location, Mburabuturo, can you spell that please? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can spell it.  Mburabuturo is a hill near Gikondo, and it's written M as in Matata, B as in Bernard, U as in Uwimana, R as in Rwanda, A as in Anatole, B as in Bernard, U as in Uwimana, T as in Teldo (phonetic), U as in Uwimana, R as in Rwanda, O as in Oscar.  And the actual year was '73 when the incident -- when the incident occurred. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, thank you very much for assisting us with the spelling, and the next time you do that, please do not give us a word to clarify each letter because then we will have to spell all those words.  So just the spelling is fine.  And secondly, remember that you are in a courtroom now, so that all your answers must be brief.  Here comes the next question.  
(Pages 14 to 17 by Jean Baigent)


































1015H
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Was it in '93 or '73 this incident happened?  Just for the record.  We have two versions.  
THE WITNESS:
'73.  I was 20 and a half years old when I experience -- I saw my colleagues being harassed, and that disturbed me.  I did everything possible to protect and save them, but I was repelled so much.  I was revolted so much by that incident that I had to leave school. 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Mr. Witness, only brief answers.  That answer could have been formulated simply by the year.  

Now, here comes the next question. 
THE WITNESS:
Okay. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, your occupation at the ******************************************************** and how did it end? 
A.	I was ************************************************************************************* and I did not make any distinction.  I looked at merits and not regionalism, regional origin.  I did not look at ethnicity.  I just looked at capacity and, apparently, that disturbed my secretary general at that time and that led him to dismiss him -- to dismiss me from the job. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, were you involved in any political party? 
A.	No, I've never been involved up till now in any political party. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, in October 1990 -- I don't finish my question because there was a minor technical 
	problem -- were you involved in human rights defence, be it in respect of a political party or an association in October 1990? 
A.	In October 1990 I did not belong to any political party or any political organisation.  I joined ARDHO, the Rwandan association for human rights.  When I left, I was released from prison in 1991. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We were in open session, Maitre Cantier.  There are many elements which put together could maybe give an indication as to whom they are talking about. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I think that the witness's fear, which made him testify via video link, concerned his actual coming to this country and not in relation to his identification, because he's someone who is actively committed.  So I don't think that those particular -- I mean those particular -- that particular information can really be harmful.  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right, but we will maintain the pseudonym, I understand. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, were you personally worried during the events which took place in your country as from 1st October 1990? 
A.	Yes, I was arrested.  I was beaten up at the Rwamagana judicial brigade.  I was jailed in Kibungo prison for two and a half months from 4th November 1990 to 15th January 1991, and I was arrested and detained as an accomplice of the RPF. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you remember the date on which the préfecture of Kigali city was established? 
A.	Yes, it was -- according to my research, it was in June 1990. 
Q.	Do you remember the date on which the first préfet of Kigali was appointed? 
A.	Yes, immediately after the round-up of 1990, and I was almost detained in that round-up.  So, yes, since October 1990. 
Q.	According to you, Mr. Witness, who were one of the victims of that repression, did the 
préfectoral -- were the préfectoral departments involved in the mass arrests which took place in October 1990? 
A.	What I noticed at that time, personally I was arrested by soldiers in Kimihurura.  I was in Kigali.  I was lucky I was not taken to the Nyamirambo regional stadium.  I was in Kigali up to the 13th of July.  I went to request for a laissez-passer at the PVK préfecture, which I received on the same day.  I was lucky to get a car which drove me to the Kibungo in the Muhazi commune where I lived.  So, in the neighbourhood where I was in, I did not see city police come to arrest me.  Later I found out that it was the public prosecutor's office and the intelligence services which were involved in those operations of mass arrests. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, earlier on you told us that your first involvement in human rights organisation came subsequent to your release in January 1991.  Now, Mr. Witness, could you tell us in which organisation were you involved then? 
A.	I joined directly the first association created on the 30th September '90.  That was the 
	association rwandaise pour la defense des droits de l'homme.  It's acronym is ARDHO.  
MR. CANTIER: 
ARDHO is number 1 on our list, and it is spelt A-R-D-H-O.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please remember, both of you, the pause between the question and answer and answer and question.  Thank you.
     (Pages 18 to 19 by Melissa Hook)


	1030H
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, at that time, in Rwanda, that is in 1991 -- such involvement in favour of human rights, was it something common in Rwanda at that time? 
A.	No, people called me crazy.  It's the same thing today, because when you are involved in human rights, then you risk your life and limb.  It was very difficult and one required a great deal of determination.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, up to when did you remain a member of ARDHO? 
A.	I was a member of ARDHO up to May --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I beg your pardon, Mr. President, from the interpreters, could the answer please be repeated because there was a disconnection in the link.  We're sorry, sir.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, could you simply repeat your answer?  We had a problem with the link.  
THE WITNESS:
I was a ************************ of ARDHO up to May 1995, when I decided ***********************, when I had come at the end of February of the same year, because I was being threatened.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, what was your occupation?  What were your duties in ARDHO? 
A.	I was the **************************** of ARDHO, and I started working with my own money, because the association at that time did not have the financial resources with which to work.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you and your association, were you between 1991 and 1994, were you -- did you denounce and speak out human -- against human rights violations in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes, we denounced many human rights violations everywhere, be they killings, abductions, massacres and other human rights violations.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, since your association followed closely the issue of human rights violations, in your investigations, in your reports, did you denounce acts of violence committed by Mr. Renzaho? 
A.	No, we never denounced Renzaho or his personality.  The only problem we had to deal with in regard to the préfecture were the vendors, and we organised courses for the vendors, for the préfectoral policemen, and other officials, and things went on quite well in that regard.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, could you give us more specific examples citing areas of serious human rights violations which your association had to speak out against between 1991 and 1994? 
A.	We denounced the -- denounced the Bugesera massacres in 1992, the Kibuye massacres in the Gishyita commune, the Kibilira massacre in the Kibilira commune, and the Muhororo massacres.  
We denounced some abductions here and there in the country as well as confrontations between political party members.  

MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, the first name that I was -- I remember is Bugesera, that is number 51 -- number 51 on the list, and then I lost track.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Now, Witness, are you able to remind us of the second name that you mentioned and then pause, so that I see -- I check if I have it on the list.  If I don't, then I'm going to invite you to spell it.  
A.	I referred to the Bugesera massacres, the Kibuye massacres in -- 
Q.	Pause after each name, so the second name you've just mentioned, Kibuye -- 
MR. CANTIER:
Kibuye, Mr. President, is number 175 -- 195, sorry, 195. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	And which one was the third name, Witness? 
A.	Gishyita was still -- the massacres in the Kibuye préfecture.  The third name is the Kibilira massacres.  
MR. CANTIER:
Kibilira is 100 -- 193.  
THE WITNESS:
The next -- Bigogwe massacres, because there were some Bigogwe who were killed at that time.  
MR. CANTIER:
Bigogwe, Mr. President, is number 22 -- 22.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	And then, Witness, have you completed with the list? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are now referring to a list dated the 4th of July 2007? 
MR. CANTIER:
No, it's the one dated 9th July, updated today.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And then there was a location in Kibuye, wasn't that Gishita, Mr. Witness?  G-I-S-H-I-T-A, is that correct?  Gishita, G-I-S-H-I-T-A, was that the reference? 
THE WITNESS:
Yeah, it was Gishyita, G-I-S-H-I-Y-T-A (sic).  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, in addition to your activities in Rwanda with the ARDHO, did you have any activities at the international level?  Are you linked with any other organisations at the international level? 
A.	Yes, we had links with other organisations, we even participated in the creation of the Inter-African Association of Human Rights in 1992, and we finally got in touch with the -- Amnesty International and human rights.  So we were in touch with other organisations, such as in 1993, together with other organisations of the CLADHO; we commissioned the first investigations on violations of human rights in Rwanda.  
Q.	Witness, were you present in Rwanda during the events of April to July 1994? 
A.	No, I was not in Rwanda.  I had come to Belgium for studies in human rights, and if I were in Rwanda, it is obvious that I would have been killed.  
Q.	Witness, did your family remain in Rwanda? 
A.	My family remained in Muhazi commune where they were attacked on 12th April, very early on that day, 12th April 1994, my wife, my daughter, and my third child were all wounded with machetes.  The other children were beaten.  Fortunately they survived.  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, Muhazi is number 237 on the list.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, when did you go back to Rwanda? 
A.	I went back to Rwanda on the 22nd July through Burundi.  I got to Kigali on 22nd July and I went to see my family at Gahini where they were -- where they remained.  
Q.	Witness, are you able to spell the name you've just mentioned, because I don't have it on the list?  
A.	My family, since they had been wounded, my wife and children were treated at Rwamagana hospital, where they were taken by the RPF, and then evacuated to Gahini.  Gahini is in Rukara commune in the former Kibungo préfecture.  Gahini is G-A-H-I-N-I. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which commune did you mention? 
THE WITNESS:
Rukara commune at -- at the time, R-U-K-A-R-A.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you don't have to spell what I'm asking you now, just repeat it, please, which préfecture? 
THE WITNESS:
Kibungo préfecture.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, when you came back to Rwanda, what did you dedicate yourself to? 
A.	When I came back to Rwanda, I went -- I got involved directly in the investigations on the massacres that had taken place.  I came back with money, which I had collected in Europe, and I immediately started clandestine investigations in Rwanda together with my colleagues who survived.  We started in Kigali, beginning from the 15th August to 10th December, 1994. 
Q.	Now, Witness, these investigations, are you able to say in what kind of framework did you work? 
A.	I worked in this as part of these investigations as the treasurer of the association, because I had the money of the association.  I also worked in the field.  We set up three teams, each one made up of 
two investigators.  
Q.	Witness, apart from ARDHO, were there other organisations that took part in these investigations? 
A.	We participated in the investigations as members of CLADHO.  CLADHO had four associations:  ADL, AVP and LIPRODHOR.  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President -- 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Can you spell ADL, Witness, because I do not have it on my document? 
THE WITNESS:
ADL is the Association pour la Defence des Droits de la Personne et des Libertés Publiques, the association of rights of the persons and public liberties.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the spelling of the abbreviation, please, only? 
THE WITNESS:
ADL. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And then you referred to at least one other abbreviation.  Can you help us with that, please, the spelling? 
THE WITNESS:
It was A-V-P-C-R.  A-V and P.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So only three letters, A-V-P, nothing else? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you now given us all the abbreviations you mentioned? 
THE WITNESS:
No, I'm waiting for you to prompt me to give the next, but otherwise I can go ahead and explain the abbreviations, just as I did for ADL.  AVPC, the association of volunteers for peace; and the LIPRODHOR which I mentioned in the last position, is the Rwandan league for the promotion of human rights:  la Ligue rwandaise pour la promotion des droits de l'Homme.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and the last one is spelt L-I-P-R-O-D-H-O-R, isn't that so, Mr. Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
It is L-I-P -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness went a bit too fast, we didn't get the rest.  We got L-I-P.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, are you able to say the work that you did yourself, as part of the investigations that you made reference to? 
A.	Together with my team-mate, who at the time was *********************, we went through many cellules in Kigali town.  We went through three communes -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The sound quality is getting bad, I'm sorry about that, I didn't get it. 
THE WITNESS:
We went through several cellules, I don't know if I should mention all of them, because I still have 
them -- have them in mind.  There was the Kacyiru commune, the Kicukiro commune -- the three communes which were part of the PVK.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, as the President requested to you a while ago, if you could speak a little more slowly that would be very useful.  And then let me request you to please spell the name of the colleague that you referred to and with whom -- or who was a member of your team? 
A.	Well, I'll try and speak slowly.  My colleague, ***************************************************
Q.	Witness, of the organisations that you've referred to, to which one did he belong? 
A.	********* was a member of the Kanyarwanda association, because the report was a report of CLADHO -- Kanyarwanda, so CLADHO was an association of four associations, and Kanyarwanda was another association. 
Q.	I think you did not mention that name a while ago; that was an oversight on your part because if we recall clearly, you referred to ARDHO, ADL, AVP and LIPRODHOR.
A.	They were members of CLADHO -- they were members of CLADHO, so there was -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Listen, listen, you are both now referring to abbreviations and organisations in a very impressive speed.  Can't you just slow down so we get this on paper?  

Now, CLADHO is known.  But then there was this new word, Maître Cantier, can you help us with that one? 
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, that is what I attempted to do because I reminded the witness that he did not mention that name earlier on.  But the explanation that he has just given enabled me to understand why.  If I may just go through it:  There is ARDHO, AVP, ADL, LIPRODHOR, these four were members of -- or they formed CLADHO, if I understood what he explained.  And in addition to that, there was a Kanyarwanda association.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	And Witness, are you able to spell the name of that association? 
A.	Kanyarwanda is K-A-N-Y-A-R-W-A-N-D-A.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And when it comes to AVP, sometimes we get a couple of other letters.  Is this organisation only AVP or two more letters?  Can you help us, Maître Cantier? 
MR. CANTIER:
If I understood clearly, that association was AVP.  So there was ARDHO, ADL, AVP, 
LIPRODHOR -- these four. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, I only want the abbreviation of AVP.  Is it AVP or AVPCR? 
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I heard only AVP, and the witness gave the -- what the acronym stands for:  
Association des volontaires de la Paix, the association for volunteers of peace.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, did the committee submit a report and if so, when? 
A.	At the end of its work, which was not concluded -- and that is the dramatic aspect of the end of that mission, is that the report in a way was presented before the end of the work.  And it is the chairman of the committee, Mr. Iyakaremye, Jean Bosco, who took that responsibility and that nearly led to a disintegration of CLADHO.  

The ADL organisation desolidarised itself from the report, and there were two donors -- donors and CECI, who also desolidarised -- distanced themselves from the report.  And that is how come we were not able to continue with the work of the committee so as to deal with other regions of the country. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, hold on.  Please slow down.  Please do not give us all these details and all these abbreviations in such a speed.  Names must be spelt if we need them.  We know many names in this courtroom, but not all the names you are using.  

Now you referred to the chairman of the committee.  Can you repeat Jean Bosco's last name, please? 
THE WITNESS:
He's called Iyakaremye, and I spell it, I-Y-A-K-A-R-E-M-Y-E.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And then you appeared to refer to two donors.  Can you repeat that very slowly now?  
Which two references did you just give us, the two that distanced themselves? 
THE WITNESS:
There was the CECI, it's a Canadian association.  CECI is C-E-C-I.  And the second organisation, N-C-O-S.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
It's a federation of Flemish NGOs.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Thank you, Witness, for these explanations.  But we can try and break them down further.  First of all to enhance each one -- the understanding for each one of us, and also for purposes of the interpretation. 

Witness, that committee published a report dated 10th December 1994, and this report makes reference to the role played by Mr. Renzaho in the events.  Witness, did you participate in drafting that part of the report, and did you share in the conclusions of that report? 
A.	At the stage that the report came out, we were going through the lists.  We had to fine-tune -- withdraw duplications, and we requested two colleagues -- investigators just as our ourselves, that is, Mr. Iyakaremye, whose name I just spelt, and Mr. Nkongoli, Laurent.  Nkongoli is spelt, N-K-O-N-G-O-L-I.  They were to draft the report and present it to us.  And it was with a lot of surprise that on the 10th of December, we heard the chairman of the committee present our report, which was not completed because we were still fine-tuning the lists, and this was given on national radio, and that is what brought the finality to this report.  

But as you asked me, I do not share in the conclusions of this report, because the document was never submitted for discussion.  We were -- we were obliged to sign it because it had been disseminated before the conclusion of the investigations, and before the conclusion of the fine-tuning, and that is what I referred to as the dramatic aspect or the dramatic nature of this report.  
Q.	Witness, I reminded you a while ago that this report accused Mr. Renzaho, and you have just told us that you do not share the content of the report.  My question then is as follows, Witness:  Since you investigated in Kigali town, the investigations that you personally carried out, did that enable you to identify Mr. Renzaho as being the person who ordered the crimes in Kigali or one of the perpetrators of those crimes? 
A.	No, we went up the chain of responsibility all the way down -- all the way up to the 
conseiller de secteur.  
Q.	Witness, are you able to give us examples of persons that you were able to identify in Kigali town through your investigations as persons being responsible for crimes which were perpetrated in the town? 
A.	Yes, we identified three conseillers de secteur of PVK, and persons all over the place -- Nyamirambo, Kicukiro and Kacyiru, I still have some names in mind.  I don't know if you want me to list them and to spell them.  
Q.	For now, that doesn't appear to be necessary, Witness.  

Witness, are you able to tell the Chamber very concisely the methodology that you used to gather your information? 
A.	We used a very simple method which is normally used in the police service or the department of public prosecutions.  We arrived in a cellule and we found out about those people who were there during the massacres.  And when we found the witnesses of the acts, we will bring them together in a house, which has sufficient space, someone who is willing to welcome us, because we did not have a mobile office or a bus.  

So we asked these people to accompany us -- and we'll be taking notes.  People then still had a fresh memory; that was in August, September, October, such that they gave us a detailed account of what happened, giving the names, the location of the roadblocks, and mentioning the names of the victims when they were known in the neighbourhood.  Because there were people who were killed along the way, they were trying to flee -- intercepted on the roadblocks and killed.  But people who were killed in the neighbourhood, their names were given.  

At that time, people were still speaking freely.  It started becoming difficult in October when they realised that there was mass arrests of people without investigations, and they kept quiet because they said there was no point in telling the truth.  And that is what slowed down our investigations towards the end -- slowed down the testimony of eyewitness.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, there were names of people which were mentioned in the report, and who were denounced as being criminals, and then there were further investigations, which showed that mistakes had been made.  Could you -- if they exist, could you give us examples or an example of mistaken denunciations? 
A.	Oh, yes, of course, yes, of course.  This was a report which contained many errors depending on the specific investigations, and that really made our report be -- to be flawed.  

I can give you the case of a member of ADL, Mr. Jean Rubaduka, who was wrongly named in the report.  Because members of CLADHO could go and talk to him, he was someone who had not left town.  

So you had these kinds of mistakes.  There were many people, who were mentioned, and they contacted CLADHO, but unfortunately CLADHO didn't have the resources or the time.  Personally, I left in 1995, so we could not really follow up what had happened.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you've just mentioned a name which is not on the spelling list.  Could you please give us the correct spelling of the name? 
A.	He was a lawyer, a former conseiller, a councillor at the state council.  His name was Jean Rubaduka.  Let me spell Rubaduka.  Rubaduka is spelt R-U-B-A-D-U-K-A.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you remember the name on -- or names of other people who were named in the report as having participated in the genocide, but who subsequently were cleared of such accusations? 
A.	Yes, as I said, there were many complaints.  For example, there was the former defence minister, 
Mr. James Gasana, who had fled Rwanda in July 1993, and who had sought refuge elsewhere.  
He was mentioned in the -- in a part of that report, but he had sought refuge in Switzerland.  But according to the Swiss authorities, he was cleared of those suspicions.  

Then, there was Paul Mbaraga, who was a journalist at radio -- Deutsche Welle, who at that time, when he heard about the report, he asked me to confirm whether he had been accused in that report.  And this was in 1998 that I was obliged officially to denounce in writing that report.  Today, 
Paul Mbaraga lives in Kigali, and from what I know he's not -- you know, really being bothered for any reason whatsoever.

BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have just mentioned two names; could you kind spell them?  First, the name of the person who was mentioned in the report, who apparently was not condemned or convicted; and then there was the last name you mentioned.  
A.	The first person was the former defence minister under Habyarimana called James Gasana, G-A-S-A-N-A.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we know Gasana.  That's well known.  Now, the last name of Paul, please?  
THE WITNESS:
Mbaraga, M-B-A-R-A-G-A.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in your answer, you have just told us about a part of the report which was not discussed.  My question is as follows:  The part of the report devoted to Mr. Renzaho, was it discussed or not? 
A.	No, Renzaho is mentioned.  Just like the people I have mentioned, he is mentioned in the first part -- the first 40 pages, and comments which were to be redrafted by Karemyi (sic) and Nkongoli.  But we never discussed that part; we did not have a list; we had not yet completed sorting out a list.  And this was the dispute, and there were several names, actually, of people who protested against being named. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The second name you have previously spelt, but could we have the first name, please.  Can you help us with that?  
THE WITNESS:
Laurent Nkongoli; he was the deputy speaker of the Rwandan parliament.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that was the second name, which you had already spelt.  But can you repeat the first name, please?  
THE WITNESS:
Jean Bosco Karemyi (sic) and the other is Laurent Nkongoli.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, it's Iyakaremye. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ah, Iyakaremye.  Thank you.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We apologise, Your Honour.

BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, still regarding the report, because here we have had many difficulties getting it, especially through the EDS system.  We have had only a few pages of the report.  Now we have a document of 40 pages, and you have just talked about a point which raises questions in my mind.  Was there another document published on 10th December 1994 or was the document in question only 40 pages?  
A.	No, the document of 40 pages concerns the commentary part of the report as such.  Otherwise, our work on the ground was to collect names of people seen at massacres, people who took people in their house.  But the most sensitive part is the commentary part, which was to be discussed; but it was never discussed.  And that is how on the 10th of December we learnt that the chairman of the commission or committee decided to disseminate the report.  

So we -- not everyone was aware of that.  At least, what I noticed in our meeting, people were not aware of that, apart from the chairman himself.  Yet, we were also surprised to hear the report on the radio.  We had worked on the report together.  We had rented a room in Christus centre in Rebero in order to have time and space to discuss that.  So, for me, it was premature for him to disseminate the report because it was presented with many errors and mistakes and it prejudiced several people, which was not the objective of our human rights associations; in other words, to actually just attack people.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, investigations carried out in Kigali city, did they allow you to identify people responsible within the PVK?  I asked you about Mr. Renzaho; you answered me.  Now, I am asking you the same question regarding staff members of the Kigali city préfecture.  
A.	Apart from the secteur conseillers, whom I can mention if you wish, we did not find any authority of the préfecture who incited people to commit massacres. Personally, I had the opportunity of going through the documentation and interviewing people, and found out that Mr. Kibungo (sic), the sub-préfet, assisted orphans; he assisted other people to be evacuated towards safer areas.  But we were told that there were some PVK police officers who killed some of their neighbours.  But what we saw is that there were individuals who committed -- or participated in massacres in an isolated manner without being asked to do so by authorities, apart from areas where secteur conseillers were seen on the scene of the massacres doing that, as was the case at the 
Sainte Famille. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, in your answer, you have mentioned a site known as Sainte Famille, in English, the Holy Family.  Now my question is as follows.  Did you personally investigate into the CELA site, the Saint Paul site and the Sainte Famille site? 
A.	No, I did not personally investigate those sites because at that time when I started investigating, the sites were empty, people had gone back to their homes.  It was in our investigations in neighbourhoods that we met people who had sought refuge at those sites and told us about what they remembered regarding the time and those places.  I have some information regarding what happened at those sites through my -- which I got through my investigation in the various neighbourhoods of Kigali city.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, we understand that the sites were empty, therefore, you could not go and see people who, of course, were not there, so you had to investigate in neighbourhoods.  But you carried out your investigations in respect of those sites and in respect of the events which occurred there; right? 
A.	Yes.  Overall, we took into account other events which took place in Kigali city.  People gave us an account of what happened at where they were.  So, the information we'd got were wide -- were general information, which were not really like a road traffic accident.  No, we got information came in -- amongst a massive amount of information, and we had to sort out such information.  And that was what we were doing when the report was disseminated. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Could you please tell us, when one read the so-called raw material, so to speak, of what you did, did you talk about the involvement of the préfet of the city in relation to the CELA events? 
A.	Yes.  We heard that he left when Interahamwes came to look for people who were either infiltrators or accomplices.  So he actually went there, Bourgmestre Bizimana went there, and, after the abduction of some young people, Father Munyeshyaka proposed that the remaining refugees should be taken to Sainte Famille, where they should join other people who had sought refuge there in order to avoid them being isolated at CELA, which was a small centre and which did not have adequate space.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, what information did you gather in -- with regard to the attacks against the Saint Paul centre and Sainte Famille centre, more specifically, according to information gathered during your investigation, did -- was Préfet Renzaho -- was Préfet Renzaho involved in those attacks? 
A.	Here I am categorical.  It was out of the question to talk about involvement of Préfet Renzaho in those attacks.  On the contrary, we know that Sous-Préfet Simpunga, Aloys, helped a lot of people who were at those centres, particularly at the Sainte Famille centre.  He evacuated people to another place and, together with Wenceslas Munyeshyaka, helped them get food.  If Préfet Renzaho was involved, then he definitely had prevented his sub-préfet from helping those people.  And I think that Préfet Renzaho was very well aware of the activities of his aides. 
Q.	Did the investigations you carry out -- you carried out -- allow you to identify the perpetrators or the participants of attacks which were carried out against those sites?  
A.	Yes, they were militiamen made up of many kinds of people, particularly delinquents and bandits from Kigali city, and other people as well.  And what happened at the Sainte Famille is that -- when people give you an account of what happened they just said, "Interahamwes came".  They could not give you names of people, particularly since there are many Interahamwes who did not use their real names.  So they would only identify some people who committed the crime.  
But regarding people who were known by authorities, we were able to know the actual perpetrators because they were known.  But I have to say most Interahamwes were people who weren't identified because people did not know them, and they used different names.  And I heard some names, but that was a long time ago.  People talked -- used to talk about Interahamwe, Interahamwe, Interahamwe, without giving specific names of those Interahamwes.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, as you suggested earlier on, could you give the Court information regarding heads of secteurs who apparently were involved in those events? 
A.	Yes.  From memory, I can mention Odette Nyirabagenzi, Rugenge secteur conseiller, where young people abducted at Saint Solare (phonetic) were killed.  There was another conseiller called Kamatamu.  I believe Odette -- if my memory serves me well, Odette Kamatamu was from the Muhima secteur.  As a lady who often comes in testimonies of people, she was an inspector of the school area of that sector; her name was Angeline Rukahuty (sic).  
MR. CANTIER:
The three names came up, particularly with regard to the massacre site of Sainte Famille.  Mr. President, they are names with which we are familiar, but not the third one.  That is on 164 on our list.  It's at 164 on our list:  Kamatamu, Euphrasie. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in your investigations did you establish a link between Interahamwes and the leaders you just mentioned and with the préfecture -- with Renzaho, as being the préfet?  
A.	What appeared to us, as I said, is that massacres were committed, often by groups of individuals, and often without a direct link to any authority.  The Interahamwes who came with Conseiller Odette or Conseiller Angeline, those attacks took place, but we did not find, in respect of them -- we did not find a link between those attacks and those officials on the one hand, and Préfet Renzaho on the other.  There was no link, because he went to Saint Paul and Sainte Famille 
and -- within the context of his work, often accompanied by UNAMIR officials.  But we did not establish any link or any evidence showing that those conseillers had received orders from him.  

And I also told you that the sub-préfet publicly assisted refugees.  And the préfet could not have -- behind such assistance, could not have authorised massacres to be carried out, no.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell us, when did you leave Rwanda? 
A.	I left Rwanda on 27th of February 1995, and I went to Belgium.  I had gone there to try to look for something -- a solution to something, but I did not know that I would be there up to now as a refugee.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you are not a supporter of the old regime, you were not present during the events; so what made you flee from your country? 
A.	You see, in our work as human rights activists we were doing very dangerous work, because we work -- we deal with violations of human rights and we try to identify perpetrators as well as victims.  I started working as *************** during the CLADHO Kanyarwanda effort.  Parallelly, I found that with regard to massacres by Interahamwes, parallel to that, there were massacres committed by RPF.  I found that.  So I would go to cells of gendarmerie stations, I found people who had been unjustly tortured or arrested, I became very well known in the country because I was considered to be fearless, going not only to Kigali but throughout the country.  I was looking for people who had been abducted, who had disappeared.  So all my work involving the disappeared people after RPF had taken power, all that made me to be considered by the new regime as someone undesirable to be eliminated.  I escaped several assassination attempts.  I decided to temporarily leave my country, and see whether the situation would calm down and whether the government would put an end to killings, massacres, abductions, which were still continuing almost throughout the country.  So it was because of my activities as an activist who did not tolerate those activities and was not afraid, I was obliged to leave earlier than the others.  Because, after me, other human rights activists went into exile, including people who went into exile in 2004.  So it was in my capacity and in respect of the work I did in human rights. 
Q.	What happened to the association to which you belonged to initially, that is, the ARDHO? 
A.	L'ARDHO was an association which was, very early, taken over by people close to the government, because when former chairman of ARDHO Alphonse Murango (sic) became minister of justice, it was the RPF -- our association -- I beg your pardon -- our association had a new chairman.  So, our association was taken over by RPF -- people close to RPF.  Our association was the spearhead of other associations, members of CLADHO; and it was neutralised, particularly after my departure, and Richard Nsanzibara (sic), who had been an assistant who had replaced, who was a Tutsi, who also became permanent secretary after me, and who had to leave at the end of '97 to go to Canada, where he still lives.  

So, after that, ARDHO did not do much in terms of human rights activities.  I know that it is -- I heard that it still exists.  But I have not seen any reports which try to denounce acts of violence which are taking place currently in our country right now.  After the departure of the person who *************, that is Mr. Charles (sic) Nsanzabaganwa -- I will spell -- that is spelt N-S-A-N-Z-A-B-A-G-I -- A-N-W-A, Nsanzabaganwa. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And now the last name of Alphonse, please, the spelling?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  Nkubito is spelt N-K-U-B-I-T-O.
MR. CANTIER:
It's 295 on the list, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And is that the person who later became minister of justice, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  The first minister of justice in an RPF government.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And, now, the last name of someone called Richard?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I spelt it, but I can repeat.  **************** before I was forced to flee the country, and he ************************************.  When he was there, ARDHO tried to work under difficult conditions, but he did honest work.  But when he left, ARDHO became -- fell under the patriotic front.  I spelt it, but I can repeat it. It's N-S-A-N-Z-A-B-A-G-A-N-W-A, Nsanzabaganwa.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And what was his first name?  
THE WITNESS:
Richard.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Not Charles? 
THE WITNESS:
No, Richard.
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, you made reference to ARDHO.  Are you able to briefly give us the fate of the other human rights associations, particularly LIPRODHOR, since your departure?  What has become of them today? 
A.	Unfortunately, associations who were members of CLADHO saw most of their members -- active members go into exile.  The last ones were the leaders of LIPRODHOR, who left in 1994, after a parliamentary report accused them of being revisionists, and because they continued denouncing violations of human rights in Rwanda.  So, today, those associations have been forced into silence, or if they do anything, then they do it in line with the position of power.  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I have come to the end of my examination-in-chief.  

Thank you, Witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  We didn't have an 11 o'clock break today because we had this break in connection with the video link from 9:40 to around 10:05.  

Would it be all right with a little break before your cross-examination?  How long is that estimated to be, Ms. Melluish?  

MS. MELLUISH: 
I don't think my cross will be more than about half an hour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, but then we have time.  Let's start at five minutes to 12. 

The Court is adjourned.  
(Court recessed from 1142H to 1203H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecution, we have to stop at 12:45 today.  
MS. MELLUISH:
Okay.  

Your Honour, just before I start, perhaps I should let this Court know what's happened with regard to the documents I might be using with this witness.  They were sent by the registry to The Hague, where I understand they have not been received in The Hague.  And I gather from my case manager that some of those are now being faxed through.  It may be that we have to work without the witness being able to see any of those documents before him.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will see how it develops.  I understand there is only one day which The Hague is prepared for.  But what we could do, if suddenly a question arises, is maybe to postpone parts of your cross-examination to the afternoon, if the need arises.  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Witness, you said you were arrested on the 4th of November 1990 and only released in February 19 -- January, sorry, 1991.  That's correct, is it? 
A.	Yes, ma'am, that is correct.  Your information is accurate.  
Q.	And, as I understood it, your arrest was part of what you described as the roundup that took place following the RPF invasion; is that right? 
A.	No.  My imprisonment in Kimungu (sic) is not linked to the -- my arrest in Kigali, because I was released immediately.  I was talking about people who came to where I was, because on the night of the 4th to the 5th I was blocked in Kigali.  I had gone to Kigali on the 1st.  We did not know that war would break out.  I remained in Kigali up to the 13th of October.  

On the night of 4th to the 5th, there were gunshots.  I was afraid, I could not sleep.  And at that time, in the morning, I was arrested when there was a roundup in Kigali city.  There were soldiers, yes.  Whereas, my arrest in Kibungo took place on 4th of November; in other words, later when I had returned home to the commune.  So these two events took place in two different places.  
Q.	Okay.  So what...(microphones overlapping) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Another microphone was on, so we didn't hear you.  Can you please repeat?  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Just so I am completely clear, Witness, you were arrested on the night of the 4th to 5th October in Kigali as part of that roundup, and then immediately released, is that right?  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  I was arrested in the morning.  There was firing at night.  Soldiers in the morning came into houses.  I had my identity card showing that I was from Kibungo.  Since the rebellion had started in the northeast in Kagutumo (phonetic), I was able to explain that I was not from there.  I was detained for one or two hours, not more than that.  And my arrest of the 
4th of November was linked to the fact that I went to the brigade to talk on behalf of my brother who had been arrested, being accused as being an RPF infiltrator.  So when I went there, I was arrested and, actually, I was put in prison. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You know, Mr. Witness, that question could have been answered simply with "yes".  Will you try to observe that when it is possible.  Here comes the next question.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Why is it in the statement that you made for the Defence on the 17th of April of this year that you gave the impression that your arrest and, indeed, your case in Kibungo was all part of the massive roundup following the RPF invasion? 
A.	I did not give that impression.  There were roundups in October and they continued in different places in the country.  When I went to the brigade, that is, the police station, to talk on behalf of my younger brother, I was impris -- arrested, just like those people who had been arrested in October.  And there was -- it was the same reasoning running through those two months.  So I was arrested as being an accomplice of the RPF.  
Q.	You said that the préfet could not have had anything to do with these arrests because he wasn't appointed until afterwards; is that right? 
A.	Not exactly, because I explained that I was arrested by soldiers.  It was -- not by the -- not by police officers or officers of the préfecture.  That is what happened on the 5th of October. 
Q.	Which was, of course, the date that the préfet, Renzaho, entered into office, wasn't it?  
A.	He entered office on the 6th.  He was appointed on the 6th of October.  I don't know when he actually entered his office because I have not checked that.  But I know that he was appointed on the 6th of October.  The country was at war, so they needed, maybe, to have a military officer to become a préfet in order to deal with that situation. 
Q.	But you weren't, at that time, working for the préfecture office, were you? 
A.	I have never worked for the préfectoral office. 
Q.	So you are in no position to tell us what role Renzaho did or did not have in those arrests, are you? 
A.	I testified to what I saw at that time, where I was.  And even later when I was in ARDHO, we worked in all areas to try to see -- to check the massive human rights violations.  I had a talk with Nkubito, who was working for the public prosecution office.  He took part in the arrests of RPF accomplices. So in that -- in the course of that work I was convinced that Préfet Renzaho was not involved in those arrests.  
Q.	Did you hear some of the large amount of criticism that Renzaho received for his involvement in the sale of the property of Tutsi who fled following the arrests in October 1991 (sic)? 
A.	I know that properties of Tutsis who sought -- took refuge following the 1990 war were sold on the basis that they had loans from banks.  But, of course, the sales were linked to politics; we should not be hypocritical.  But I do not have any concrete information showing that he was involved in auctioning those properties.  That could have been possible, but the préfet was not involved in the sales of those properties.  But I know that properties were sold in order to recover bank loans, and I don't see what role the préfet could have had in those auctions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you just refer to arrests in October 1990 or October 1991?  
MS. MELLUISH:
I am sorry, Your Honour, I made the mistake of mentioning 1991 instead of '90.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Witness, from that rather long answer you just gave, should I take it from that that you did hear the criticism that Renzaho received for the sale of the properties? 
A.	At that time, I did not hear criticisms regarding the préfet.  But over the last 13 years, that is, later, we have been hearing a lot of things said. 
Q.	Now, you left Rwanda, didn't you, on the 12th of March of 1994 and returned from your stage in Europe on the 22nd of July of 1994, didn't you? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So nothing that you can tell us about Renzaho's activities during the genocide comes from your own direct experience, does it?  
A.	That is correct.  All that I know actually emanates from investigations. 
Q.	The investigations that you carried out along with other members of the CLADHO team from the 15th of August 1994 to the 10th of December 1994; that's right, isn't it?   
A.	Yes.  My investigations did not stop there.  Even after going into exile here in Europe, and up to now, I have continued working on several investigations with either entities or interested citizens, I have continued working.  And it is within the overall context that I am being able to testify currently.  
Q.	But after February 1995, you have not returned to Rwanda, have you? 
A.	No, no.  
Q.	So your most thorough investigations were carried out between the 15th of August and the 10th December 1994, when, as you said yourself, people still had a fresh memory of the events; isn't that right?  
A.	Yes; however, as I said, investigations are permanent work and I am continuing with my investigations.  From 15th August to 10th December '94 I dealt with the part concerning Kanyarwanda CLADHO.  But I -- I was in the country, I amassed vast information.  And even though when I went to Europe I continued looking for eyewitnesses, people who had been in Rwanda.  I am still doing this, because an investigator always has new elements, either confirming or otherwise what you already know.  
Q.	You told us that you don't agree with some of the conclusions drawn by the CLADHO report published on 10th December.  That didn't stop you signing it, did it, Witness?  
A.	Yes.  I explained that we signed in order to avoid a breakdown of CLADHO.  Unfortunately, we did not avoid the split within CLADHO.  CLADHO exists, but only on paper.  It does not have cohesion as before, and that -- and I said that that committee had actually published a report which was incomplete. 
Q.	Witness, isn't it disingenuous to sign a document that you don't agree -- or, indeed, categorically disagree with the contents?  
A.	Yet that was what was one -- was the special aspect of that particular document we signed, because the chairman of the commission presented a report which was not complete.  We discussed it, as I said in examination-in-chief.  We all must have thought that in order to calm down people, we decided to sign the document, in spite of the fact we knew that there were many, many imperfections.  Subsequently, we turned out to be right.  There were complaints, there were disassociations on the part of donors, as well as the umbrella body CLADHO, which was part of the investigations.  
Q.	You mentioned disputes with donors.  You didn't lose the donations from Christian Aid from London or Amnesty from Belgium, did you, as a result of the publication on the 10th of December '94?  
A.	Is that a question or is it a -- or are they just comments from you?  
Q.	Yes or no, did you lose the donations from Christian Aid and Amnesty, which you didn't mention earlier?  
A.	I did not talk about losing funds.  I talked about letters disassociating those entities from the report.  I did not talk about funds.  I talked about donors who made known their criticisms and reservations and said that they did not agree with the report because the report was biased.  They would have wanted also the crimes and violence committed by RPF to be included in the report.  And that is what led the donors to disassociate themselves with the contents of the report.  But I did not talk about funds because the donors continued funding the association.  
Q.	And that ties in with what you said earlier, which is that the reason that you couldn't continue with the report and finish it properly was that you couldn't -- you were unable to deal with the other regions of the country, so that the report only dealt with the préfecture of Kigali-ville; that's right, isn't it?  
A.	I think maybe you did not hear me well.  I talked about criticism from donors who said that the first part was not objective because we investigated only one side; the other side does not appear in the report, so our report was biased.  That is why we stopped, but not because of lack of financial resources.  It's because the first part was already disqualified.  
Q.	I just want to refer you to a few extracts from your report.  
MR. CANTIER: 
There was a cut-off in the sound and we did not hear the end of the witness's answer for at least 15 seconds -- for at least about 15 seconds.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you now referring to the very last answer?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. We saw him speak, but we did not receive any sound.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we heard you say the following:  "I think, maybe, you did not hear me well.  I talked about criticism from donors who said that the first part was not objective because we investigated only one side.  The other side doesn't appear in the report, so our report was biased.  That's why we stopped, but not because of lack of financial resources.  It's because the first part was already disqualified."

Now, this is what we got down here.  Did you say anything else in your last answer?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is what I just said.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Witness, I am going to refer to a number of extracts from your report and I will be telling the Court where they can find those extracts.  I do appreciate that you don't have the document before you, and please let us know if there is a problem related to that.  But it's right -- and the document is at -- it's the seventh document in the bundle.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Page?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Well, first of all, it's the seventh document of the CLADHO Kanyarwanda report.  That's the first question.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have understood that.  Now, which page, please?  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Can we look at page 16 in the English and page 14 in the French?  

Witness, do you recall that one of the conclusions of the report that you signed was that members of the Rwandan government and their collaborators were implicated in the killings and, amongst those people, you mentioned a man called Côme Bizimungu, the préfet of Kigali-rural, which is about the ninth or tenth name down the list.  
A.	As I told you, the -- we signed the document.  I acknowledged this and I said this; however, the content --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness -- 
THE WITNESS:
-- actually binds only the authors. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Do you remember that there was a reference to Côme Bizimungu in the report, yes or no?  
THE WITNESS:
I don't have the list of those people in front of me here.  If my memory serves me well, we are talking about Côme Bizimungu.  We talked about him in ARDHO when he was the préfet of Gisenyi at that time.  I don't know how he enters into this report because I did not participate in the drafting of this report; and, therefore, in this respect I cannot help you.  I don't know why the people who drafted this part of the report put Bizimungu here.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Witness, do you recall, at page 24 in the English and page 25 in the French, that the report concluded that among the sponsors of the genocide were the members of the crisis committee established on the 8th of April 1994; do you recall that?  
A.	I did not get your question clearly because there was a loss in communication.  There was a loss in communication; can you please repeat your question?  
Q.	Do you recall that your report concluded that amongst the sponsors of the genocide were the members of the crisis committee established on the 8th of April?  
A.	Yes, as far as I am concerned, you are asking me about the content of that report.  As I told you, I signed the document without accepting its content, and I have told you the circumstances under which it was written.  But that does not mean that, personally, while investigating the tragedy -- the Rwandan tragedy, I could find another person.  But, otherwise, the formulation -- the document and the language used is from those persons -- the two persons who drafted it.  So I cannot comment on it. 
Q.	What about this, Witness?  You said that you were involved in investigations in all three communes of the préfecture of Kigali-ville.  Do you not recall that, at page 27 in the English and 28 in the French, your report concluded, when it came to the responsibility of local and national authorities as follows, "Préfet Tharcisse Renzaho was named in all the cities' neighbourhoods as a person who distributed arms and ammunition or incited people to track down Tutsi"?  

Can you hear me, Witness?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you hear us, Mr. Witness?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, Mr. President, we cannot hear the witness.  

Yes, we hear him now.  
THE WITNESS:
I can hear you -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And we can see and hear -- 
THE WITNESS:
But I cannot hear the President's voice.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's because I am silent waiting for you to stop speaking.  

Now, here comes the Prosecution.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Witness, I don't know if you heard much of my last question so I will repeat it.  

You said that you were involved in investigations in all of the communes of Kigali-ville.  Do you then dispute, nonetheless, the conclusions in the report which stated that 
Préfet Tharcisse Renzaho was named in all the cities' neighbourhoods as a person who distributed arms and ammunition or incited people to track down Tutsi, he even went as far as dismissing one of his bourgmestres, the one for Kicukiro commune, and replacing him with someone that had no training whatsoever who happened to be the chief of Interahamwe for the Gikondo neighbourhood".  Do you recall those conclusions?  
A.	I do not recall that, but since you are saying it, then it has to be in the report, but we did not discuss it.  But if you want my opinion, I can give you that subsequently, because I knew the former bourgmestre of Kicukiro.  He also fled and was replaced by an Interahamwe.  But, otherwise, the presence of Préfet Renzaho in the neighbourhood, as I said earlier, I did not observe it.  He came to the Sainte Famille, to CELA, and Saint Paul also, once or twice to 
Sainte Famille.  But, as I said, in the neighbourhood, we did not observe his involvement, and that is why the contents of this portion of the report was not the subject of a consensus, and I was not involved in it.  
Q.	What about the statement on the document marked number 8 in the Court's bundle that, "Monsieur le préfet Renzaho, Tharcisse, is one of the major instigators of the genocide and the massacres".  Is that something you also claim today to dispute? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you now refer to an annex to the same report?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We seem to have lost The Hague again.  

Yes, Mr. Witness, can you hear the voice now, my voice?  
THE WITNESS:
I heard the beginning of the President's intervention.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you recall the question just before we lost each other, namely, a reference to an annex to the report?  Did you hear that quote?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, we are losing the witness.  We just hear bits of his answer.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just answer with a yes or no now, Mr. Witness.  Did you hear the Prosecution's question about this annex to the report?  
THE WITNESS:
Since I cannot see the content of the report, I don't know what is contained in there, and I don't know how you classified or how you structured the document, and I don't t know which passage you are referring to.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you see, the Prosecution read out a couple of sentences, and my only question is whether you heard those sentences.  But, in view of the time that has elapsed now, she will read it again.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Witness, in the annex to the report, it states, "The préfet, Tharcisse Renzaho, is one of the major instigators of the genocide and the massacres."  Is that statement in the report that you signed on the 10th of December 1994 something that, today, you also dispute? 
A.	Yes, yes, I dispute that. 
Q.	Similarly -- and I am referring to tab 9, another allegation made in your report -- do you dispute today that Aloys Simpunga was named as a participant in the genocide along with Alexis Bizinkuli? 
A.	I don't know if that is mentioned because I do not have the document, but I know he saved a lot of people, and there is a lot of testimony to that event.  Bizinkuli, I have no idea about that.
MS. MELLUISH:
And at tab 10, Your Honours. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	What about Major Nyamuhimba, also described as a genocidaire in the report of 10th December; do you now dispute that?  
A.	I cannot confirm or deny that because I have -- I do not recall hearing his name in the neighbourhoods that I investigated.  But, as I said, the fine-tuning of this list was not concluded before it was broadcast on radio.  
Q.	Okay, Witness, what about tab 11 -- what about Gaspard, the chauffeur of Renzaho?  He was accused in your report.  Do you now dispute that? 
A.	I cannot confirm nor deny that because you are the one mentioning his name now as one of the accused persons.  But, in Rwanda, a lot of people are accused.  
Q.	Do you agree with me -- or do you agree with the conclusions of your report regarding Angeline Mukandituye being the president of the Interahamwe in Rugenge secteur? 
A.	That is clear because, in addition to this report, I heard several testimonies of several witnesses speak about Angeline Mukandituye.  So, quite apart from this report of CLADHO, I heard testimonies accusing this woman.  
MS. MELLUISH:
So -- Your Honours, with reference to number 12. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	So, your report is correct, inasmuch as it said of her:  "Her house had become the staff -- the general staff headquarters of the Interahamwe, that is where the Interahamwe lived --  the trained Interahamwe lived, and who were -- the escort of the president.  Regular meetings were held in her house for purposes of drawing up a list of the remaining Tutsis, specify their place of refuge and to organise attacks to eliminate them.  Before attacking, all the killers went to the general staff headquarters to procure for weapons -- to collect weapons and ammunitions." 

Do you agree with those conclusions, then, Witness?  
A.	The formulation and the content could be different from the truth because I did not cover that cellule.  I think it was André and Bernadette.  But, personally, I heard on several occasions witnesses talk about the involvement of this woman, as well as in my investigation here in Europe, I met people who talk about this woman. The fact that she is involved is indisputable, but I cannot comment on the details that you are reading.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have to stop now.  As I said, 12:45 there was a meeting which was supposed to start.  We will then continue at 2:30 and we hope that any technical difficulties will have been eliminated by them.  It's gone quite nicely so far.  We will then come back Arusha time 2:30, with other words, one hour earlier Hague time.  

The Court is adjourned. 
(Court recessed at 1248H) 
(Pages 29 to 44 by Judith Baverstock) 





























(Court resumed at 1439H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon.  Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  Can you hear us well?  
THE WITNESS:
I can hear you very clearly. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  We will now hear the last questions to be posed by the Prosecution. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, do you recall what the report said about the conseiller Odette Nyirabagenzi? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And am I right that you agree with the conclusion that she supervised the organisation of the genocide in Rugenge secteur? 
A.	The wording could be true or not.  What is sure is that she was seen at several places where Tutsis were abducted. 
Q.	Well, Witness, let me remind you please of the wording - 
MS. MELLUISH:
	And, Your Honours, I'm looking at number 13 in the bundle.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Your report, Witness, states: "She is responsible for all the killings which were committed in her secteur by soldiers, Interahamwes and other killers.  She led abductions, killings operated at sought" -- "at places of refuge, the killings of fugitives, in other words, at the Sainte Famille church, the community of Sister Teresa" -- "Mother Teresa of Calcutta, Centre of missionary of Africa, CELA, as well as the Saint Paul centre and the hostels or homes of the JOC."  
A.	Sorry?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Hold on now.  What has happened now is that Prosecution Counsel has read something out to you. 

Now here follows the question. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Now, you have heard a more detailed summary of the conclusions of the report, do you recall them and do you agree with them? 
A.	In general I agree, without approving the wording.  As I told you, Nyirabagenzi was seen at various sites.  My conviction is that Nyirabagenzi participated in massacres.  But the wording here, talking about all centres, is something I cannot know, because this is a disputed document. 
Q.	And, Witness, finally on this report, do you recall that the report concluded that the church was particularly responsible for the genocide?  And do you recall the following passage from the report: "The most" - 
MS. MELLUISH:
	I am sorry, Your Honour, I'm reading from page 34 in the English.  It's page 36 in French, tab 7.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Witness:  "The most glaring example was at the Sainte Famille church where Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka had taken over as parish priest after the flight of the Tutsi parish priest.  He stood out by actively siding" - "he stood out by actively siding with the genocide perpetrators.  He behaved as a real Interahamwe in all he did and everywhere he went."  Do you recall that passage, Witness, and do you agree with it? 
A.	Yes, I remember that.  And I can see what it means because there have been such accusations.  However, the acts as they took place are contrary to what he is being accused of regarding many things.  I think that what he did can be discussed, in that people who were threatened could interpret such -- or such attitude by Father Munyeshyaka differently, because someone under threat cannot generally alleviate the situation.  The information which I have gathered up to now, shows that 
Father Munyeshyaka is not a genocidaire.  And if there is a neutral commission I think he will be 
really -- he will come out at the end as a hero. 
Q.	Witness, it seems that there are some allegations in this report that you refute today and others with which you are quite happy.  Does your view on this change depend on who has asked you to testify for them? 
A.	No, no.  It's because I have a lot of information which I cannot give in detail right now.  You have asked me for short answers.  That is why I'm brief, in order to avoid wasting time.  Wenceslas was not a criminal.  He's not a genocidaire.  He helped people with the means he had at that time.  I've had the opportunity to publish something on that subject.  That's why I want to go to the logical conclusion because, you know, talking about bulletproof vests, and so on and so forth.  Whatever he did were strategies he took to help people being threatened.  That is what I gathered from testimonies of people. 
Q.	Witness, was it -- when was it that you decided that this CLADHO report was something you disagreed with, presumably after you signed it on 10th December 1994? 
A.	The day of its disclosure, except not only publication, but its disclosure.  That when I gave my opinion.  I explained to you that the fact that we signed it has nothing to do with the contents of the report.  We wanted CLADHO to exist and not to spilt up.  That's what I said. 
Q.	After you left Rwanda, never to date to return, in February 1995, it's right, isn't it, that you gave a number of witness statements to this Tribunal; do you recall giving those witness statements? 
A.	Yes.  I came here for the Akayesu trial, in ninety--
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We missed the last part because of communication breakdown. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, which year?  Can you repeat?  
THE WITNESS:
I came here in February 1998 to Arusha to testify in the Akayesu trial.  That is if I understood your question, Counsel.  
BY MS. MELLUISH: 
Q.	Witness, on that occasion you came to testify for Akayesu.  I'm referring to statements you have given to investigators from the office of the Prosecutor here at the Tribunal.  Do you recall, for example, making a statement on the 21st March 1997? 
A.	Before the tribunal?  Or -- I did not come to the Tribunal in 1997. 
Q.	I think, Witness, there may be a linguistic misunderstanding.  I'm talking about a document that was typed up and signed by you, not an oral testimony that you gave here.  Do you remember signing such a document in March 1997? 
A.	I signed a lot of documents.  Can I see that one?  
Q.	If the bundle of documents that we sent to The Hague has now been located, you should have that document before you.  Perhaps someone could clarify whether a blue folder of documents has arrived?
MR. TCHIDIMBO:
Yes, Prosecutor.  We have received the folder from Arusha.  Could you please give me the number, so that I could give this document to the Witness?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Number 4. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Do you recognise your signature on the bottom of the French version of that statement? 
A.	Yes, yes. 
Q.	And isn't it right that on page 3, at the beginning of the second paragraph, in both the English and the French version, you stated in 1997 of this CLADHO report:  "The conclusions of the report are very similar to my personal convictions concerning the situation in the country which inevitably led to the massacres and killings which followed the attack on the president's plane."  
A.	Yes, when I say they are similar, it regards the substance, not the details.  Because we have a way -- people have a way of wording questions and wording answers in order to pass on information.  Among the civilian authorities, there were not people who were capable of stopping the massacres.  But it would be wrong to think that all the authorities approved the massacres, or participated in the massacres actually, that would be wrong. 
Q.	Witness, you never wrote or published or signed a retraction of this CLADHO report, did you? 
A.	The first time I challenged the report was regarding the journalists I mentioned at beginning of the testimony.  It is Paul Mbaraga who works for the Deutsche Welle and who was mentioned in the report.  This was in 1998.  I did so in writing, and I explained what I explained earlier on in this testimony concerning all the challenges against this report.  That was in 1998.  And I believe I did this later for James Gasana when he was attacked in Switzerland.  I had to give the Swiss investigators working on the case updated information. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, the last name of the journalist called Paul, can you help us with that, the spelling?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  Paul Mbaraga.  I'll spell that, M-B-A-R-A-G-A.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Melluish?  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	In respect of those two individuals, Witness, you say that you retracted what was written about them in the report in 1998.  But in 2000, in another statement that appears at tab 5 of your bundle, which you made for this Tribunal, you were happy, weren't you, to refer to the report without any caveat about its contents?  And I am referring to the last line of page six over to page seven in the French; bottom of page five over to page six in the English.  Do you see that, Witness? 
A.	Yes, I can see page six and page seven where I have it as well. 
Q.	There you've referred to Odette Nyirabagenzi and Angeline Mukandituye.  And you state:  "I was a member of a six-person investigation team that went to investigate in the three communes of the capital city Kigali.  You can find a copy of this report at CLADHO."  There's no mention there, is there, of any caveat you might have, as you claim today, about the quality of that report, or its findings in general? 
A.	We're talking about two women here, and throughout my testimony here, I've said that these women were mentioned by several witnesses outside the report.  I did not only cover August to September.  I continued and still am continuing.  So one can access, reduce or add something to a report according to ongoing investigations.  

So, I don't see how this is inconsistent, because there are some things in the report which are true.  Some of the information in this report can be challenged, in that they were not discussed.  They were not debated and the report was just issued just like this, and we just signed it.  But here I don't see any inconsistency because I'm talking of something that existed.  And these people are mentioned in the report as well as by witnesses who are not covered by the report.  So this is a good thing.  

But the reason I mentioned the Kanyarwanda club or the report was simply to also mention those women who had also been mentioned outside the report. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, it is true that there is consistency between the report concerning these two women and what is in this witness statement.  The point put to you by the Prosecution is that you refer to the report in that connection, and in making that reference you are not making the point that you have some misgivings about that report in relation to other parts.  You seem generally to indicate here that the report is all right, since you refer to it.  
That's the question put to you; do you have any comment on that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I do.  The fact that I mention the report is because the report exists.  No one can delete it.  It will continue to exist.  But the reason there is no caveat here, it's not because those facts did not take place.  There were witnesses who were -- who testified to the dispute regarding when the report was disclosed on 10th December '93.  And these are my comments.  But there are some true things in the report.  It is -- what is challengeable is the overall manner in which this report is presented. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  No further questions.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Anything you want to tender here?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Please, yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  And we can do it in a while when we've said farewell to the witness.  What you intend to tender is the report and the appendices thereto?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Indeed. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Any re-examination, Defence?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, one question. 
RE-EXAMINATION  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, Counsel for the Prosecution a while ago asked you a question on the presence on page 14 of the French version -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could you English interpreter kindly speak into the mike, so we hear you a bit more clearly, please?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Very well, Your Honour. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  Sorry about the interruption. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Do you want me to go over, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, we got it.  But just continue from where you left it please.  Thank you. 

MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, Counsel for the Prosecution mentioned page 14 of the French version of the report, and asked you a question about the presence among those who are being incriminated, mentioned Bizimungu, Côme.  Witness, do you also remember in the same list there is the mention of Mr. Ntagerura André and Bagambiki, Emmanuel? 
A.	Yes, I can see that, because I have the list in front of me. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, we didn't get the second part of Witness's answer. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, can you repeat your entire answer, please?  We lost something maybe. 
THE WITNESS:
I said that the two persons who were acquitted by the ICTR, Mr. Ntagerura and Bagambiki, Emmanuel, were incriminated by -- in this report and acquitted by the ICTR. 
MR. CANTIER: 
I have concluded, Mr. President. 
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Mr. Witness, my question concerns the report.  Do you remember who collected information about Mr. Renzaho's activities at that time?  
THE WITNESS:
It's definitely -- must have been one of our colleagues because we shared out the cellules, but the committee met to discuss the whole -- all the results of the investigations.  But that is what is lacking in the report and that is why there is dispute over this report, even though we finally signed for reasons that I've already explained. 
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Do you recall how many people, and who in particular, were examined in this respect?  
THE WITNESS:
I do not know the people who were investigated in the report because the report was challenged right from the beginning when it came out.  And there are other people who remain in Rwanda for 13 years who were not supported because of this report.  Jean Paul Mbaraga, who is also in Kigali.  So there are other persons.  I do not have the whole lists.  I've not seen the lists for several years.  But if there were people who were tried on the basis of this report alone, that would have been serious. 
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Would it be fair to think that one of your colleagues distorted information in respect of Mr. Renzaho's activities during the events?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can suspect that.  I can suspect that.  In a sense that some of our colleagues, who were members of the team in Kanyarwanda became important members of the government establishment.  There is one who became vice speaker of the parliament, and one who is a currently a member of parliament.  There's one who has sought refuge in Canada.  He fled in 1998.  He was chairman of this committee.  After -- he fled in 1998 after being the presiding judge of the court of first instance of Kigali.  And that leads me to the conclusion that they may have changed the report for political interest or to gain -- to secure a position within the government establishment. 
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You refer to one person called Jean Paul, who apparently was wrongly accused.  Can you repeat his last name with spelling, please?  
THE WITNESS:
Paul Mbaraga.  I think I say Jean Paul because normally people have the two names.  But what is normally known and what is in the report is Paul Mbaraga.  So it is Paul Mbaraga.  Let me spell Mbaraga once again, M-B-A-R-A-G-A.  He's a former journalist in Rwanda and Deutsche Welle, sorry. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This report was submitted by the commission composed of seven members.  That's true, isn't it?  
THE WITNESS:
No.  That is the point.  The report was not presented by committee, because it was published, and was the sole responsibility of the chairman of the committee, that is, Mr. Jean Bosco Iyakaremye, whom I mentioned early on, who has also taken refuge in Canada since 1998.  Otherwise we did not have the opportunity of inviting people to present their report because the report was not completed.  That is why there is dispute over the report.  It is signed.  We signed after the report was published. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I am looking on page two of this report now, Mr. Witness.  And there are seven signatures dating the report to the 10th of December 1994, and your signature is one of them. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, yes.  I do not dispute the fact that my signature is here, and I explained why we signed. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
And that explanation has been noted.  But do we then agree that there were seven members forming part of this exercise which led to this report?  These were the persons entrusted with this task, is that so?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, but members of the committee did not have the opportunity of drafting the report and presenting it at the end of the discussions.  The report was presented by the chairman of the committee without mentioning it to the other members of the team.  We were all surprised, saying on Radio Rwanda -- presenting it on Radio Rwanda on 10th December.  That is why the discussion of the investigation stopped on the 10th December, and I've explained why. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But you see this is an unusual situation, Mr. Witness, that someone signs a document of such an importance.  So you need to bear with us when we have to ask you a few more questions about this.  

Now, when did the chairman make the statement on Radio Rwanda that led you into some kind of a 
fait accompli situation, where you felt that you had no choice but signing in order to avoid a rupture or lack of co-operation between these NGOs?   When did you sign?  
THE WITNESS:
If my memory serves me right, it was on the 10th December. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So the statement was made on the same day as the date of the signature; is that so?  
THE WITNESS:
I do not have a clear recollection of that, but I believe that must have been the case. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
At least according to page two, the signatures were entered on page two -- the signatures were entered on the 10th December.  So shall we assume that now, then?  
THE WITNESS:
I will not be able to assert that it was signed on the 10th December.  What is sure is that on that day, we decided to stop the report as of that date because it was published without being completed.  I said we were discussing it.  This document of 40 pages is not something that was ever presented to the committee for discussion.  That is the problem of this report.  And I agree with you, that it's an unusual practice, that you sign something that you don't believe in, and when something is disclosed before it is concluded. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You read this report on which date?  
THE WITNESS:
When did we read the report?  We never read the report because we did not have the opportunity to present it.  The report was presented before the conclusion of our work, before we finished drafting it.  So it was presented at the stage at which we were.  So you find duplication in the report because we had not yet fine tuned the list.  Particularly, since we did not meet to agree that the report was to come out on a certain date.  

So, we were all surprised.  We were taken by surprise by its presentation on radio.  And from that -- based on that we sign.  We sign it so that CLADHO is not dissolved, so that nobody is victimized, because we have to recognise the fact that if you sign a document that you don't believe, there is a problem with that.  The problem is that CLADHO might disintegrate, and also the physical constraint, because we were under a regime which probably instigated a premature presentation of the report. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please do not use so many words and please don't repeat your evidence.  I'm just trying to solicit some additional information before we leave you.  

Now, the announcement was made on the radio on the 10th December and you signed that page two on the 10th of December; that we have established now, haven't we?  
THE WITNESS:
The report was presented in the evening, and in that evening it was obvious that we did not need to sign it.  I'm not able to say the date because this is something that happened 13 years ago.  What is sure is that even before we signed this document, we dispute -- it was a long dispute among us, not just me.  All of us insulted the chairman.  If you find those people who were present, they will confirm the same thing.  Now, regarding the date on which we signed, I'm not able to say because that was a long time ago. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
How much time elapsed until you saw this report or read it, the written version?  Not what you heard on the radio, please.  
THE WITNESS:
It was after its presentation and after we had fought among ourselves.  And you need to witness that to see how everybody was angry with somebody who disclosed the work which had not been completed.  And the signature which took place subsequent to the presentation.  If I recollect rightly, we maintain that day because that was the date on which the chairman decided to present an uncompleted work.  But I cannot tell you the number of days because that was a long time ago.  Maybe with consulting with other members of the committee who were present, I might remember.  But I was not expecting this kind of question, so I did not ask anyone.  But if you so wish, I can always ask people and we can get clarifications because I was not alone.  There were other witnesses as well. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So the signature was only added, even if it was not on the 10th December, after you had acquainted yourself with the written version of the report.  Is that the evidence?  
THE WITNESS:
We did not read the document, because the document before being presented should have been read, and then there would have been a consensus on its content.  So we sign it without having read it.  So we stopped work on the 10th December.  After the 10th of December we did not do anything about the report apart from the typing by the secretary who was in charge.  So there was no discussion on this portion of the report.  We did not conclude the fine-tuning of the lists.  And, as I said, we were doing it at the cultural centre at Remera  so we stopped everything at that stage.  Those who distanced themselves, did so immediately as soon as they got the content the report. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We really want to finish this now.  Please listen to the question.  When did you first read this report?  
THE WITNESS:
I read this report long after I signed it.  But, well -- on that very day I just went through and there were things that I saw, and I expressed that. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So your discussion about the substance of this report took place then in light of what you heard on the radio, but not based on the substance of the report because you hadn't actually read it?  
THE WITNESS:
This report was not submitted to any discussion when we signed it.  We find ourselves before a 
fait accompli and we either sign or do not sign, and we prefer to sign. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And of these seven persons, how many reserved their position in relation to this report?  
THE WITNESS:
To tell the truth we decided to -- without examining it, without reading, without discussing, if my memory serves me right, because we decided to sign without going into the content because we stopped discussion on the day it was presented.  That was the day the committee stopped its work.  

If you wish, I can tell you that the day on which the chairman presented the report, that was the day of the crash of the report.  So, you will understand that no -- people did not have the opportunity to discuss something that was dead, maybe dead.  To say it died is just a way of speaking.  That's the word I can use to describe it. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you know whether you are the only member of this group who take exception to this portion about Mr. Renzaho which was read out?  Do you know the position of the other six?  
THE WITNESS:
I don't know.  I'm giving you my opinion.  I don't know what the other members think.  The fact is that we did not discuss the list or the content of this portion of the report, because here you have 40 pages of commentary which we assigned to somebody who never came back with a report for discussion.  I don't know if there are other members who challenge the content or confirm the content.  But I'm telling you, I'm giving you my opinion.  Opinion is not just based on this report, but based on 13 years of work because I told you that I continued with my investigations.  Even those who are wrongly accused, I'm still working on them because I just want to get to the truth. 
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Should I take it that when you were signing this document, you were not aware of the allegations brought against Mr. Renzaho?  
THE WITNESS:
Maybe I did not explain myself correctly.  When I signed it was not for someone or anyone else.  We signed a document which was not discussed, for reasons which I have explained.  So it was not for somebody who appeared in the report.  I've given my opinion on Paul Mbaraga.  And now I'm giving my opinion on Renhazo, Tharcisse.  It's solely on these three cases that I've had to give my opinion in relation to this report which was presented before completion. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  This was the end of your testimony.  Thank you for having contributed to the work of the Arusha Tribunal, and we wish you all the best.  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will then say farewell to The Hague.  Thank you to everyone who facilitated this video link. 
MR. TCHIDIMBO:
Goodbye, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Goodbye.  

Now the exhibits, you probably want the commission report of 10th December together with the annexes in one exhibit number. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
I think that would be easiest, although there is, of course, the English version of the report, as well, but the annexes are not translated. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Why don't we simply note that the exhibit number contains, when it comes to the main part of the exhibit, two versions, English and French?  But we can content ourselves with one exhibit number, which will then be, Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
P. 112. 
(Exhibit No. P. 112 admitted)   
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And this exhibit number includes both the main report plus circled in number eight, nine, ten, 11, 12 
and 13.  These were the document numbers referred to by the Prosecution.  Anything else?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
No, thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  We will then bring in Witness HIN. 
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, I didn't want to interrupt Your Honour.  At the commencement of this afternoon's session Prosecution has been served with a number of photographs that, as I understand it, the Defence wish to have this next witness tender.  They include photographs of a number of sites, some of which we have photographs which we have tendered and for which I can verify, ones including CELA, 
Sainte Famille and Saint Paul.  

There are a number of other photographs which purport to be other locations, which I am not in a position to verify or to properly cross-examine this witness in relation to.  So, whilst I have no objection, and I'm trying not to be overly difficult, but whilst I have no objection to photographs of matters, photos that I can see and recognise.  I do have difficulty, and will be objecting, to the introduction of any other photographs.  So I thought I should advise Your Honours of that now. 
	(Witness entered courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, what we will do is simply take this step by step.  We note your introductory statement.  And when, or if, reference is made to a photograph which causes a problem, you will draw our attention to it and then we'll see how to address the matter.  

Have the parties received any written communication from the witness concerning this judgment? 
     (Pages 45 to 56 by Melissa Hook) 










1530H
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We have received two handwritten pages in Kinyarwanda, and then an officer of the witness protection unit has very kindly translated these pages into French, using a typewritten version.  Has everyone received these documents?  
MR. MOSES: 
No, Your Honour.  And I'm aware we are in open court, so I don't know whether these -- any discussions can go on in open court. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No.  We have to exercise caution here.  It's just to find out who's got what.  And you haven't yet received anything on the Prosecution side.  

Defence have you received this?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Not yet.  Nothing.  We have not received anything, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's difficult to proceed without further copies.  

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will just pause for a moment while we are reading what you have kindly written during the time we were not together, and then we will come back to you in a moment.  So just hold on for a minute or two.  
THE WITNESS:
Very well. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
In order to an ensure efficient communication with this witness, I think we have to move into closed session. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 58 to 75] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
