MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  The Court is in session.  I understand there was a slight delay, but we hope you are well now, Witness.  Good morning.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are feeling well now?  
THE WITNESS:
I'm fine.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.

EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Mr. Witness, yesterday you told us about what you did on the 8th of April.  Can you now tell us, please, what happened on the 9th of April? 
A.	I did not do anything particular on the 9th of April.  I spent the day in the office up until the evening when I returned home, but I didn't go anywhere. 
Q.	What office is that you are talking about? 
A.	The préfecture office. 
Q.	And can you tell us, while you were at the préfecture office, what did you see there? 
A.	I was about to notice the movement of staff and the préfet also would go out and come in.  There was nothing unusual, apart from the movement of people coming to see the préfet, most of whom were soldiers, but there were also civilians who came to see him. 
Q.	And, can you recall on that day what Renzaho was wearing? 
A.	As usual, he was wearing a military uniform. 
Q.	What about the following day, the 10th of April, can you tell us what you did on that day? 
A.	Counsel, I would like to remind you that I did so many things on that 10th of April such that I'll not be able to explain to you in detail what I did; however, I remember that we went to the home of Protais Zigiranyirazo.  We went there in the morning.  When we arrived at Protais` home the préfet entered the house and we stayed within the compound.  There were many people at Zigiranyirazo's house. 
Q.	Okay, first of all, from where did you travel to Zigiranyirazo's house? 
A.	We had left the préfecture office to go to Protais Zigiranyirazo's house.  We took the road passing in front of the Banque Nationale de Rwanda and which goes down to what, at the time, was Mr. Zigiranyirazo's home. 
Q.	Can you tell us who you mean by "we", please? 
A.	I was following the préfet's vehicle. 
Q.	And besides the préfet, was there anyone else in his vehicle? 
A.	No, apart from his military driver, I did not see anyone enter his vehicle. 
Q.	And when you got to Zigiranyirazo's house, can you tell us, please, slowly, what happened? 
A.	When we arrived at Zigiranyirazo's house we found many people there.  I was able to recognise Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Robert Kajuga and George Rutaganda, but there were other people inside I couldn't identify. 
Q.	Can you tell us who is Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	I knew Mathieu Ngirumpatse was the President of the MRND. 
Q.	And Protais Zigiranyirazo, who is he? 
A.	I knew Protais Zigiranyirazo at the time when he was the préfet of Ruhengeri préfecture, but I also knew him under other circumstances. 
Q.	What circumstances are those? 
A.	I knew him because I hail from Gitarama region wherein he had a concubine, and since I often went to that place I had seen him there on several occasions at the time that he was still the préfet of Ruhengeri préfecture. 
Q.	Thank you.  And can you tell us who is Robert Kajuga? 
A.	Robert Kajuga was the national leader of the Interahamwe. 
Q.	And Georges Rutaganda? 
A.	Georges Rutaganda was his deputy at national level within the Interahamwe, but he was also active within Kigali town. 
Q.	When you arrived at this house, what did Renzaho do? 
A.	He went and spoke to Zigiranyirazo.  They started their chat outside, then they subsequently entered the house, but I was not aware of what they were talking about. 
Q.	For how long, if you can recall, was Renzaho at that house? 
A.	They stayed together for about two to three hours. 
Q.	And during all that time where were you? 
A.	We were within the premises at the place where *****************; however, in the meantime Colonel Renzaho or, rather, Zigiranyirazo had come to ask me to go to the city centre.  He sent me along with the soldier and we went to one Mbyareyehe, who was a conseiller.  When we arrived there Mbyareyehe was standing in front of his store.  So, we loaded the foodstuff that Mr. Zigiranyirazo had asked us to load up, that is rice and cooking oil, at the end of which we went back to Zigiranyirazo's.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you left the préfecture office when on the 10th of April?  

THE WITNESS:
We left the préfecture office around ten o'clock.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You arrived at Mr. Zigiranyirazo's house when?  
THE WITNESS:
It didn't take us long, at most two to three minutes.  It was just close to the préfecture office.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Renzaho was with his driver in the car, no one else, that's what you told us, is that so?
THE WITNESS:
That's right.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Who was ************, if any?  
THE WITNESS:
I was with four policemen who were also moving around with me.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Were you back from collecting foodstuffs at Zigiranyirazo's house when Renzaho left? 
A.	That's right, I had already dropped off the foodstuffs. 
Q.	Can you tell me, if you know, where Renzaho left when he left Zigiranyirazo's house? 
A.	He went to the préfecture office. 
Q.	And how do you know that? 
A.	We followed him. 
Q.	When you arrived at the préfecture office, do you know what Renzaho did? 
A.	No, immediately he arrived he went straight to his office.  I don't know what he did.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, it's very useful if we can take this step-by-step and finish each sequence and we get all the information we need in relation to one step and then we move on.  Sometimes that can be a bit challenging, in particular, if the witness wants to move on rapidly, but we try to structure the witness that way.  

Now, you told us, Mr. Witness, that you had to go somewhere to fetch foodstuffs.  Was that what you told us?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is what I told you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
When were you asked to leave Mr. Zigiranyirazo's house in order to do that?  
THE WITNESS:
It was around eleven o'clock.
MR. PRESIDENT:
In other words, about one hour after the commencement of the meeting, if we shall call this a meeting.  Is that so? 
THE WITNESS:
That's right.
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much time did it take you to go to this place, get the food, and come back again?  
THE WITNESS:
It didn't take us long.  I would say around 40 minutes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	When you returned to the préfecture office, what did you do? 
A.	Nothing else.  I stayed there waiting until around 6 p.m. -- sorry, 5 p.m. and I went home. 
Q.	Now, the following day was the 11th of April.  Can you recall what you did that day? 
A.	On the 11th of April I did not do anything particular. 
Q.	Were you at home or did you go to the préfecture office, as you had previously? 
A.	As usual I went to the office. 
Q.	And before the end of the day did you leave the préfecture office? 
A.	On the 11th of April, no, except perhaps for the midday lunch break, and I did not need to request permission for that purpose.  It was I took my lunch very close to the préfecture office, so I would go and enjoy my lunch and return to the préfecture office without needing any permission for that. 
Q.	Did you see Renzaho, at all, on the 11th of April? 
A.	I saw him. 
Q.	Can you tell us what he was doing? 
A.	He was not doing anything particular.  I simply saw him go out of his office, then he would return to his office and he was alone. 
Q.	Were there any other people at the préfecture office that you saw that day? 
A.	Yes.  There were some people who came to the préfecture office. 
Q.	What kind of people were these? 
A.	Civilians, soldiers and some influential Interahamwe, because, you see, some of the Interahamwe were influential and could directly contact the préfet. 
Q.	And do you know what these people were doing at the préfectoral office? 
A.	There was only one activity, the planning and implementation of the massacre, because at the time the massacre had already started, so it was a question of planning and implementing the massacre.  Putting an end to the massacre was out of the question.  Everybody has a lone objective of pursuing the massacre, so all those who came to that place, were to receive instructions in that connection.  Even though I didn't have discussions with those people, I could, after all, understand what was being said.  No one intended to go and rescue people from being massacred.  All those who came to that place were there to receive instructions on how to go and further the massacres.  There was no other activity. 
Q.	Now, the following day, the 12th of April, in the morning, what did you do? 
A.	On the morning of the 12th of April I went to the préfecture office, as usual.  When I got there I sat down and stayed there until around twelve o'clock when the policeman came and saw me and asked me to go to the Hotel Diplomate.  We went there.  When we arrived there one of the policemen entered the building.  He then came outside with the soldiers who were there.  They took out guns and loaded them in the vehicle.  After that operation Kabiligi came and we went to the préfecture office, where the guns were offloaded.  But after the offloading, the guns were immediately loaded anew into the vehicle.  That was around 2 p.m.  They even took out other weapons from the préfectoral building and others yet from Kabiligi's four-wheel drive vehicle which guns were loaded **************.  We went with Kabiligi to the roadblock located at Zigiranyirazo's residence where we dropped off some weapons and then we left. 
Q.	Thank you.  I'd like you to go through that a bit more slowly, please.  To start with, you said you were at the préfecture office as usual and some policemen came to you and ************ to the Hotel Diplomate.  Now, when you left the préfecture office ****************, were you alone? 
A.	I was in the company of the four policemen *******************************. 
Q.	And when you left, was ************* the only vehicle which left the préfecture office? 
A.	No. Kabiligi's four-wheel drive vehicle was in front of us, and when we arrived at the destination he parked his vehicle.  ***********************.  And when the weapons, which were in ************, were offloaded they were taken inside and then brought outside again and, once again, loaded into *** ************.  They even took out some of the weapons which were in Kabiligi's vehicle and loaded them ********************
Q.	When you left the préfecture office with Kabiligi's vehicle in front of you, did you know that that was Kabiligi's vehicle? 
A.	Yes.  I knew because we could see Kabiligi.  We left the office and Kabiligi and Renzaho were driving one behind the other, and we were behind them, so there were three vehicles, the first to Kabiligi, then Renzaho's, and then ours.  When we got to the roadblock at Zigiranyirazo's house we offloaded the weapons and Kabiligi ordered us to continue, and when I asked where to, the policeman told me, "we should go to the Kimisagara, Nyakabanda, Nyamirambo and Gitega roadblocks and at each of those roadblocks we would distribute weapons. 
Q.	I'm sorry, there might be a little confusion here.  When you first left the préfecture office in the morning you said that you went to Hotel Diplomate? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Then you travelled between the préfecture office and the Hotel Diplomate.  What other vehicles were with you, if any? 
A.	Kabiligi's vehicle had left Hotel de Diplomate headed for the préfectoral office and the préfet was not with us at that time. 
Q.	But when you first left the préfectoral office in the morning, the very first time, was Renzaho with you? 
A.	When we arrived at Hotel Diplomate he was not with us. 
Q.	So, on that day, can you tell us when you first saw Renzaho? 
A.	On that day I saw him at around 2 p.m. when we were headed for Zigiranyirazo's house and he came along with us. 
Q.	And where was it that you first saw him? 
A.	I saw him coming out of his office and we went together to Zigiranyirazo's residence, with Kabiligi, and our vehicles drove together, mine being in the third position. 
Q.	So is it right, if I understood your evidence correctly, that you said that when you went to Hotel Diplomate you were only with Kabiligi? 
A.	No, there were also some policemen.  We met Kabiligi at the Hotel de Diplomate.  We did not leave the préfectoral office together. 
Q.	So, when you left -- you did leave the préfectoral office, was it your vehicle alone that left? 
A.	That is correct.  I was in the company of policemen only. 
Q.	And when was it that you first saw Kabiligi, then? 
A.	I saw him at Hotel de Diplomate and when we left the hotel towards the préfectoral office we went with him. 
Q.	And when you -- how long were you at Hotel Diplomate?  Can you recall? 
A.	Not too long, just time enough to load the weapons and then to leave. 
Q.	And were you able to see these weapons yourself? 
A.	I saw them with my own eyes. 
Q.	Can you describe the weapons that you saw? 
A.	Well, you know, it is difficult because it was a mixture of various firearms.  I am not in a position to tell you whether it was this specific type of gun or this type of weapon, particularly in that I am not versed in distinguishing weapons, so I cannot tell you the type of weapons that they were.  All I know is that it was a combination of various types of firearms.  I would think that we had those types of guns that could be seen ordinarily in Rwanda.  And then we saw some Kalashnikovs, which were not very well known in Rwanda at that time, by the way.  And those Kalashnikovs seemed to be brand new. 
Q.	Can you estimate how many weapons were loaded *******************? 
A.	Many weapons were loaded ******************.  It was almost full.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, how many cars were together from Hotel Diplomate to the préfecture office?  

THE WITNESS:
*************, Kabiligi's vehicle, that makes two.  When we got to the préfectoral office then the préfet's vehicle joined our convoy or group, so to speak.
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	And that was at what time? 
A.	Around 2 p.m. 
Q.	Okay, so where did the convoy go, the convoy that you were in, when it left the préfecture office? 
A.	The convoy headed for Zigiranyirazo's residence, and we went to that roadblock which was set up close to that residence on the road leading from Hotel Kiyovu to the centre of the city. 
Q.	And at that roadblock, who was manning the roadblock? 
A.	That roadblock was manned by soldiers and Interahamwe, and I'm referring to the roadblock that was not far from Zigiranyirazo's residence.  And this is what I was able to notice.  I looked into the premises of a compound belonging to some Chinese and I noticed that some people were sitting down or had been asked to sit down within that compound.  That was what I was able to observe happening not far away from where I was. 
Q.	And at the roadblock, what happened? 
A.	Nothing in particular, except for the offloading of many weapons, leaving about 20 or 30 in the vehicle, and it is those remaining 20 or 30 that were distributed at the other roadblocks I have referred to. 
Q.	And when these weapons were offloaded at the roadblock near Zigiranyirazo's house, can you remember what Renzaho was doing? 
A.	He was in Zigiranyirazo's house. 
Q.	As far as you can tell, was Renzaho aware that the weapons were being distributed there? 
A.	Yes, he knew.  He knew because when we left the préfectoral office that was the purpose of our mission. 
Q.	Can you recall, if you know, how long Renzaho was inside Zigiranyirazo's house? 
A.	We went on to the other roadblocks, which I have referred to, beginning with Rose Karushara's roadblock at Kimihurura, then we went to Nyakabanda and we left two or three weapons at those roadblocks and went to Nyamirambo and dropped weapons there.  Then at Bijogo we left two weapons, as well, and I believe there were no further weapons in our vehicle.  Then we went back to the préfectoral office.  That is what I witnessed on that day. 
Q.	Thank you, but my question was, can you recall how long Renzaho was inside Zigiranyirazo's house? 
A.	I cannot say, because we spent some time along the road, but by the time we got to the préfectoral office at about 3 p.m. he was already there.
Q.	So when you travelled around the roadblocks you just mentioned, who were you with? 
A.	I was with the four policemen I have already referred to. 
Q.	And what did you do at these roadblocks? 
A.	We distributed firearms.  What happened was that we would meet some people at the roadblocks, the policemen would ask them who was their chief, and one of them would identify himself as the chief and that person would then collect the firearms.  We gave two or three firearms to some of the roadblocks or we distributed two to three firearms at some of the roadblocks. 
Q.	And why did you do this?  Had somebody asked you to? 
A.	You may want to understand that the policemen in my company had a chief and I think it was that person who indicated the locations at which the weapons would be distributed, and I believe they did so with some instructions, and they couldn't have taken that initiative without receiving instructions and orders. 
Q.	And, as far as you know, who was the chief of these policemen? 
A.	One of them, when you look at a group you can identify the chief, but the problem I had was that I was not familiar with those policemen and therefore did not know their names.  I hadn't had any discussions with them in order to know their names, but they called themselves names that I am not able to remember. 
Q.	Are you able to tell whether Renzaho was aware that these policemen were distributing weapons? 
A.	He knew.  He knew.  I have already told you that when we left the préfectoral office these people must have necessarily discussed what they were going to do. 
Q.	Thank you.  When you returned to the préfectoral office you said that Renzaho was already there.  Can you tell us what he was doing? 
A.	He was in his office, and I did not see him doing anything.  So, I asked a policeman if I could go home because it was 5 p.m., and the policeman told me to go home and come back the next morning. 
Q.	And is that what you did? 
A.	Yes, that is what I did, I went home immediately. 
Q.	And the following morning what did you do?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, how many persons were in the car from the préfectoral office to the house of Mr. Zigiranyirazo?  
THE WITNESS:
There was Kabiligi and the préfet and then **************, that makes a convoy of three vehicles, which went to Zigiranyirazo's residence.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What was the route of Mr. Renzaho after having been at the house of Mr. Zigiranyirazo?  
THE WITNESS:
When he left Zigiranyirazo's residence, are you asking me how he went back to the office?  There was no other itinerary.  He went back to the office the same way he had gone to Zigiranyirazo's house.  When the other roads were blocked, which went through the president`s residence, he therefore went through the road passing by the national bank and then by President Habyarimana's residence.  He couldn't use the other road, which was closed.  He, therefore, went by the national bank and then turned towards his office.  That is the only possible route he could have used.  I don't know whether he went to his residence and, by the way, I don't know his residence.  All I am certain of is by the time we got to the préfectoral office he was already there.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, he went in his car after having been at that house.  Were there any other cars accompanying that car?  
THE WITNESS:
I do not know.  We left him there with Kabiligi, but Kabiligi didn't enter Zigiranyirazo's house.  We went by the road at Hotel Kiyovu and left.  Many people have asked me questions about him, and I have already answered telling them exactly what I have said.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, sometimes one has to ask additional questions to be absolutely certain there is no lack of communication, Mr. Witness.  Now, who left the house of Mr. Z first, was it any particular car? 
THE WITNESS:
It is the vehicle ***************, which had offloaded vehicles at that location, which left first.  After I left and before I went too far I noticed that Kabiligi had also left and was going towards Hotel Kiyovu while Renzaho remained and entered Zigiranyirazo's residence.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	On the following morning, the 13th of April, what did you do? 
A.	On the 13th of April I left the préfectoral office, but on that day I had the first opportunity to have a discussion with the préfet.  He beckoned me with his hand to come.  He said, "Come here".  And asked me whether I knew where the Fina filling station was.  I said, "Yes."  So he asked me to go meet the station attendant at that location and tell him to come and provide some assistance.  So I went to that filling station and asked for the manager.  That person was very close to the préfet, and I told him that the préfet had sent me to come assist him. 
Q.	Can you recall what time it was in the morning when Renzaho came and spoke with you? 
A.	At about 10 a.m. 
Q.	And when you went to the Fina station, were you alone or was somebody else with you? 
A.	I went there alone, leaving the policemen behind. 
Q.	And did you assist the Fina station manager? 
A.	I couldn't do anything for him.  I wasn't distributing fuel, but all I did was *********** from the filling station to his home at the end of his working day, and then the next morning ************************ from his residence and *************** to his place of work. 
	(Questions and answers were redacted by order of the court)
Q.	And -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Shouldn't that be placed under seal?  
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, it probably should.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will delete from, ****************************************************************************** Court video system please do not transmit that.  

Next question, please.
MS. MELLUISH:
I'm grateful.
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	During that time, did you have reason to visit the préfecture office again? 
A.	No, I never went back to the préfectoral office again. 
Q.	Did you see Renzaho again? 
A.	No, I did not see him again.  Well, let's say that I would see him when he would come to fill up his car at the filling station, but I never talked to him and you may want to know that the filling station was used mainly to distribute fuel to the Interahamwe.  In fact, it didn't sell to the public, it simply pumped fuel on the basis of vouchers that were signed by the préfet.  That is why one can say that it was only every now and then that some people provided money to get fuel from that station.  But most often people came with vouchers signed by the préfet to fill up their vehicles at that filling station and most often those vouchers were signed by the préfet. 
Q.	How do you know that those vouchers were signed by the préfet? 
A.	I could see them.  The manager asked those who came to collect fuel to show proof of a document signed by the préfet, and I was often nearby and I would hear the conversations that went on between those who came to collect fuel and the manager. 
Q.	And after *************************************, did you see Renzaho again? 
A.	No, I did not see him again. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I have one final question for you.  During the time that you were frequently visiting the préfecture office, were you aware of anything that Renzaho did to stop the killings that were taking place in Kigali? 
A.	I think I mentioned something yesterday.  Renzaho never said the word "stop the killings."  He never uttered those words prior to 1994.  

I wanted to talk to you about a meeting he organised, but you told me I was not authorised to do so.  But all I can say is that he never said that he was going to stop the war.  That idea never crossed his mind at all.  If he had said those words himself, the killings would have stopped the very day or night, because he was a very powerful man.  If he had the courage to go on Radio Rwanda and say, that, "I have decided that the killings should stop,"  Then the killings would have stopped because he had the authority to do so.  All the killings in Kigali would have stopped.  I would even go as far as saying that he is responsible for all those who were killed in Kigali town, all the in Kigali town were killed because of him, and I say this without any hesitation whatsoever. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I have no further questions for you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Defence.
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, throughout your examination-in-chief you gave an account of the activities which took up your time from the 7th to the 13th of April 1994, correct? 
A.	That's right. 
Q.	And those activities are the ones you mentioned to the Prosecutor in the statement which you recorded on the 22nd of December 2003 and the 30th of November 2004, correct? 
A.	Correct, sir. 
Q.	Witness, do you remember that on the 25th of January and on the 30th of January 2006 you testified in another trial in this Tribunal giving an account of your activities during that same period? 
A.	I don't think your question is relevant.  If you saw me on those dates then you have to put questions to me if you are certain that I testified in the Renzaho trial because, as far as I know, I have never come to testify before this Trial Chamber in the Renzaho case.  I started my testimony only yesterday.  Now, if you want to put questions to me regarding my prior testimonies, then you need to get another opportunity for that. 
Q.	Witness, you didn't answer my question.  Did you testify in another case in this Tribunal on the 25th and 30th of January 2006? 
A.	Yes, and that is why I told you earlier on that you do not have to put questions to me regarding my prior testimonies because I don't see any relationship between this case and the other case in which I testified, so I don't think you should be allowed to put questions to me regarding my other testimonies.  Let me point out that on that occasion I answered questions put to me in that case.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, even if there may be different cases and different testimonies the counsel still is entitled to refer to previous testimony, for instance, in the present trial.  So you have to bear that in mind, please, should counsel wish to do so.  
Now, what is the next question?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I would like to react to your intervention.  Defence counsel has documents before him.  I don't have any documents before me.  Besides, he didn't give me time to prepare.  He did not hand his questions to the Prosecutor and he did not speak with the Prosecutor for the Prosecutor to prepare me.  Nowhere did I note the various dates he has referred to and, to be honest with you, I am not even certain that I gave testimony on the dates mentioned by Defence counsel because I must acknowledge that I am not a computer.  And I think that even Defence counsel himself could not give those dates unless he had some document he was referring to.  So I think, in all fairness, Defence counsel ought not to put questions to me regarding my testimony in another case for as long as I've not been prepared for such questions and I don't have documents before me as Defence counsel has.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You're quite right, counsel may have such documents and also that he has not mentioned possible questions to the Prosecution, but that's normal in the courtroom.  And we also understand that it is difficult to remember everything.  No witnesses are computers, so, this is not unusual.  

And here follows the next question.
MR. NEKUIE:
Most obliged, Mr. President.
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, you told the Court that Prosecution counsel prepared you for you to give testimony in connection with this trial.  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes, if you are referring to the Prosecution counsel present in this courtroom. 
Q.	That is, indeed, the person I'm referring to, Witness.  
A.	Are you referring to the lady?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, he is.  So you can confirm this lady prepared you before your testimony, isn't that so, Mr. Witness?  I think that is a yes or no answer.  You can confirm that, can you not?  
THE WITNESS:
That is correct because she called me and put questions to me and we discussed questions and she asked me the same questions.  She asked me questions based on my statement.  So those were not questions the Prosecutor imagined.  They were questions based on my statement regarding my appearance here.  I do not know whether it was at the request of the Prosecutor or whether I am here because I have been called by the Chamber.  I was called to testify and here I am.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that's good.  Now, what we want now is to ask you to continue to answer briefly the questions by Defence counsel.  They are very precise and they can be answered quite briefly.  Here follows the next question.
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, during your preparation did she remind you of the content of your statements of the 22nd (sic) of December and 30th of November 2004, yes or no? 
A.	I'm going to answer you.  Earlier on I told you something that you are putting to me that is 30th of November, 20th of December.  Well, those dates I didn't note down anywhere, and I don't have any documents before me.  So my proposal to you is to put questions to me regarding my testimony.  Now, as for questions regarding my statements of 2003 or 2004, I can tell you that I'm not in a position to answer you, and I don't see the relevance of your questions regarding my statements which are two years old already.  And I should state further that I don't have any documents before me, but I am ready to answer your questions so long as they are in connection with my testimony yesterday and today.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and these questions are relevant so now we want the next question and a brief answer, please.
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, when you gave evidence in the other trial as a witness, did you mention your activities on the 7th of April 1994? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, let me repeat that I gave evidence in another trial, and let me further repeat that I am not in a position to give answers regarding that other testimony.  So, if Defence counsel want to put questions to me regarding my evidence in that other trial, he should look for another opportunity, because I am unable to remember entirely the evidence I gave, and I have insisted that Defence counsel put questions to me regarding my testimony in the Renzaho matter.  So, I would like to repeat to Defence counsel that I am not ready to give answers to questions regarding my other testimony.  I am ready to answer any questions so long as the questions concern my testimony in the Renzaho case.  Even though those questions are of relevance to him I consider that questions relating to any other case are not relevant, and I am ready only to answer questions concerning my testimony in this Court in the Renzaho case.  And I have no answer to give him regarding what I said in my previous testimonies in another case.
MR. PRESIDENT:
One matter, Mr. Witness, is what counsel may do.  Another thing is what you may remember.  Now, what we want to know now is whether you did mention the events on the 7th of April in the other trial.  Are you able to remember whether you did that or not?  Do you recall? 
THE WITNESS:
I do recall.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you recall, did you mention the 7th of April or did you not mention the 7th of April in that other trial?
THE WITNESS:
I could not not have spoken about the events of the 7th of April because I remember very well the events of that date, but I state those are two separate cases.  And I'm of the view that Defence counsel should not be authorised to extrapolate to go and look for elements of my evidence in another case and to start putting questions to me regarding my evidence.  I'm even wondering how he was able to get the documents of that trial because he was not at that trial.  How was he able to lay hands on the documents of that trial?  That is my question.  I have told him that I am not ready to answer questions regarding another testimony in a case different from this one.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Transcripts from trials are publicly accessible in this Tribunal and these questions are normal questions.  Now, here follows the next question.
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, if that is the case, then I can entertain questions put to me by different counsel.  But in order for me to answer I would like to have access to the transcripts and hand those transcripts to Defence counsel so that he wouldn't need to put questions to me again, since he would already have the transcripts of my testimony of him because, you see, I have the impression that he simply wants to corner me.  That is why I'm not ready to cooperate with him along those lines.
(Pages 1 to 14 by R. Lear)






















1015H 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
He will now ask you his next question, Mr. Witness, and I am glad that you are ready to entertain these questions.  And whether there will be need for the transcripts, we will come back to that later.  But now we want, really, to proceed.  So we have noted your position, but now we want to focus on questions and answers, and that will make it possible for you to complete your testimony within a reasonable time.  

Now, next question.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, is the account of your activities on the 7th of April 1994 as you gave us here consonant with another account you have given in another case regarding your activities on the 7th of April 1994, or do the two accounts correspond?  
A.	Yes, actually, the account I have given before this Court is fully consonant with my activities on the 7th of April 1994. 
Q.	Thank you very much for your cooperation, Witness.  So, you told the Court that on that 7th of April 1994, two policemen came to look for you at home, they took you to the secteur office, and from there to the Kigali-ville préfecture office; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And you mentioned, further, that from the Kigali-ville préfecture office you went to Kimisagara, and this time around with four policemen; is this correct? 
A.	Yes, it is. 
Q.	Now, sir, kindly explain to the Trial Chamber how the two other policemen joined your group, or according to you, were those two policemen who were taking you to the Kigali-ville préfecture office replaced by four other policemen?  
A.	If you remember very well, I told you that the two policemen went back to the Biryogo secteur office.  The four policemen who went with me were four policemen different from the other two with whom I had left the secteur office.  Because when we arrived at the préfecture office, the two policemen accompanying me showed the vehicle to the secteur office and then -- to the préfecture office, correction, and then went back to the secteur office. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  So, if I understand you properly, there were two policemen who took you to the Kigali-ville préfecture office, and they were subsequently replaced by four other policemen.  And that means that on that 7th of April 1994, you saw in all six policemen at the Kigali-ville préfecture office, correct? 
A.	Did you say six policemen?  Nowhere did I mention six policemen.  I was not charged with making a head count of policemen.  Do you think I am in a position to give you the number of soldiers who were at the préfecture office?  If you know what the duties *********************************************.  You do not make a head count of staff while ***********************************************************.  Try and do this, and you will see.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, the two police officers who fetched you in the morning, were they the same as some of the police officers that ************************* later on in the day?  Or were they not?  
THE WITNESS: 
No, Mr. President.  You have the text of my testimony.  I said when we arrived at the préfecture office, the two policemen accompanying me immediately went back to the secteur office.  So those two policemen did not remain at the préfecture office.  They immediately went back to the secteur office. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So then Defence counsel is right, do the addition and saying that, all in all, you saw six police officers on that day; isn't that so?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The witness's microphone is off, Mr. President.  
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, when we arrived at the préfecture office, the two policemen who were accompanying me, after explaining that they were bringing back the vehicle which had been commandeered, returned to the secteur office.  But regarding the four policemen whom I met at the préfecture office, there were not just the four of them, there were many other policemen.  This is to state that there were many other policemen at the préfecture office.  But with regard particularly to the first two policemen who had come to fetch me from my home to take me to the préfecture office, they immediately returned to the secteur office after dropping off that vehicle in the préfecture office.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, at what specific point in time did the four policemen you are referring to now come and meet you in ****************?  
A.	I arrived there around 8:30 a.m., and the four policemen immediately joined me.  One of them asked me to *****************************************************, we had a brief chat.  So it was around 8 o'clock that we started our brief chat, because I arrived there around a few minutes after 7 o'clock.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Do you remember what you discussed with those policemen?  
A.	But I have already explained that:  It was not really a discussion, per se.  We were just talking about Habyarimana's death.  There was no other topic of discussion.  It was being said that Habyarimana had been assassinated by the Inkotanyi, and I think that even if you yourself were there, that would have been the main topical issue.  Everything had ground to a halt; there was no activity.  People had locked themselves indoors, others were being massacred.  There were gunshots here and there in Kigali city.  Counsel, I wonder if you understand me:  There was no other topical discussion.  
Q.	I understand you in total, Witness.  Since that was the topic of your discussion, were you able to get to know those policemen, since you were discussing with them?  
A.	What do you mean, sir?  Do you want to know whether I was able to know their names, or whether I was able to ascertain that they were Rwandans or foreigners?  What really do you mean?  
Q.	What I would like to know, really, Witness, is whether you were able to know their names.  
A.	No, sir.  Those events occurred more than ten years ago, and I must acknowledge that even if the discussion had taken place some ten days ago, I would not have been able to remember their names.  I simply identified them as policemen, and I was also able to identify Renzaho because he was an influential personality, different from an ordinary policeman. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I would like us to clarify this matter regarding the policemen, and also for the Trial Chamber to follow what is going on.  Do you confirm that the four policemen are the same policemen who accompanied you on the 7th, on the 8th, on the 10th, and on the 12th, or were some of them replaced by others?  
A.	I thought I'd already answered your questions.  Do you want us to backtrack?  When those two policemen said that they were bringing back the vehicle which had been requisitioned, they trekked back to their base.  Regarding the four other policemen, they were the same throughout the trips I made until the 12th of April.  None of them was replaced.  
Q.	Witness, I would like you to state whether you carried out your trips the 7th, 8th, 10th, and 12th of April with those very same four policemen. 
A.	Counsel, let me repeat this, and I believe for the fifth time:  I carried out the trips with those same four policemen up until the 14th of April.  None of that group of four policemen was changed. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, I would like to distribute some documents that have been disclosed by the Prosecutor, transcripts of this witness's testimony in ICTR 2001/P (sic) of 25 January and 30 January.  I would therefore like to distribute this document so that the Chamber and the entire Court can follow what I intend to do, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The Prosecution knows which documents are now being distributed?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honour, yes.  Although I understood it was just the transcript, but you appear to have a statement.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Have you been given by the Defence -- you are aware -- 
MR. NEKUIE: 
There is also a statement, Madam Prosecutor.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the letter of 4th September 2006 from Mr. Moses to Maître Cantier, in French translation.  

MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honours, the only difficulty I perhaps foresee is that the only version of the transcript I have with me is in English. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We appreciate, of course, having been given these documents now, Defence.  But whenever documents are distributed, exactly the same set must be given to the other party as well, even if that set may originally be in their possession.  There is also practice in this Tribunal to distribute these documents to the interpreters and the court reporters, unless they are particularly voluminous.  So the number of copies will usually have to be much higher than three, unfortunately.  

But let's see how we can proceed on the basis of what we have now.  Just go ahead.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Obliged, Mr. President.  I had made provision for copies for all parties, including the interpreters, but we didn't have enough time to make sufficient copies.  And I am sorry for that.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Now, Witness, regarding the number of policemen, let me refer to your testimony relating to the number of policemen in *************** on the 7th of April 1994.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, this will be on page 8 of the transcript of 26th January 2006, French version.  Are we there?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We are there in the French version, yes.  But since there are several persons in the courtroom who may prefer the other version, the general practice will be that you always give the pagination of both versions.  Do you have the English as well?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Unfortunately, no, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Then we will find it.  But next time, and whenever there is a reference to any document, please refer to both versions.  But you may well start with the French, since that is your working language.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And now the question, please.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, this is your testimony of 26th January 2006.  The following question was put to you by the Prosecutor examining you in that case.  First of all, Mr. Kapaya puts the following question to you -- that will be the fifth paragraph from below:  "What type of vehicle was Renzaho driving?"  And your answer:  "A Renault 21, except I am mistaken.  But I am certain, I believe, that it was a Renault 21.  But he was not the one driving.  He had a soldier who was his driver."  

Then the Prosecutor puts the following question to you:  "Do you remember how many people were in **************?"  Your answer is the following:  "Two policemen."  Do you remember that sequence of questions and answers, Witness?  
A.	Even if you continue to compel me to repeat the content of my testimony, I simply can only say that Defence counsel is putting questions to me arising from Prosecutor Kapaya's questions.  Now, in that case I made a testimony and I do not even recall who the Accused in that case was.  So if the Defence counsel could specify who the Accused in that case was, then I might be in a position to answer his question.  He is referring to my testimony in another case, in another trial.  Which case and which trial is he referring to?  

As far as I know, the person who was accused in that case is different from the person accused in the matter before us now.  I therefore just want to know whether Defence counsel was party to that other case, and is he in a position, or does he have the capacity to put these types of questions to me?  What I can state is that today my testimony relates to a specific case, or specific trial, but the other testimony was made in another case, and I would rather not revisit it.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And we have noted your position, Mr. Witness, and we have told you that you have to accept these questions.  Now, the first question is as follows, and please answer my question briefly:  Is it your testimony that you do not now remember the name of the Accused in the previous trial?  Is that your testimony?  
THE WITNESS: 
It is possible that I remember the name of the Accused, but I have testified in several cases and I am not sure that I can remember clearly the name of the person who was the Accused in this other case which is being referred to.  I know for certain that today I am testifying in Renzaho's case.  And maybe when I will be testifying -- or, when I was testifying elsewhere, I answered that there was one or two policemen in ***********.  And that is why I want to know from the Defence counsel which specific testimony he is referring to, but that his questions now should relate to this case before us.  We -- I believe that Renzaho's name is even mentioned in the other case Defence counsel is alluding to.  But let me recognise -- let me admit that I am able to answer questions relating to different cases.  

Once again, Mr. President, I would like to ask -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I have to stop you now, Mr. Witness.  I really have to stop you now.  Your answers are far too long, and we have understood your position.  
Now, memories fade.  That's normal.  Do you remember the name of the Accused in January 2006 when you testified?  What do you think was the name of that Accused?  
THE WITNESS: 
It was the Zigiranyirazo case.  And the question Defence counsel is putting to me relating to those two policemen, Mr. President, was indeed put to me during that case, and I provided an answer.  And -- but I went on, later on, to specify that indeed there were four policemen, and we finally came to an agreement.  And the person who was questioning me asked why I had previously said that there were two policemen.  I went on, therefore, subsequently to explain that indeed there were four policemen.  I do remember that incident, but I had gone on subsequently to explain clearly that it was not only two policemen but, rather, four.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, I am happy to note that your memory has been jolted and you can now remember.  Now, let us look at what you said about the policemen on page 16.  The Presiding Judge at that time put the same question to you, and she put the following question to you:  "Were you the only one in the vehicle as well?"  And your answer is:  "No, I was with the two policemen I have already talked about."  Does that ring a bell, Witness?  
A.	My answer is the following:  I have already told you that we had a difficulty surrounding this issue of two policemen.  I was being asked about two policemen, and I had answered that the two policemen had already returned, and that four policemen had now been given to me.  Now, if you had read through my testimony, then you would realise that I went on to talk about four policemen who came after the previous two had left.  
Q.	Witness, are you telling this Court that during your previous testimony, you finally agreed that you made those trips with four policemen and not two?  Is that your testimony here and now, Witness?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you hear the question, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS: 
I did not understand the question.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The question is:  Are you saying that in the previous trial you, at the end, stated that there were in fact four police officers in the car, after having first said that there were two; is that your testimony?  
THE WITNESS: 
That is what I said.  Let me explain:  There were four policemen with me, not two policemen.  The two policemen had left, that was the two policemen who were initially assigned to me had left, and then I continued with four policemen.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, and we have understood this.  

Now, Defence, is it your view that in the previous transcripts we will not find the correction alleged to have been made by this witness?  Is that the point?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, that indeed is correct.  I simply want to go through his testimony so that the witness can discuss this correction with me.  I have the correction here on record, Mr. President.  With your leave, can I proceed?  
THE WITNESS: 
Counsel, what I have said is that you are putting questions to me which I cannot answer.  Once again, you are putting questions to me relating to another case, and I would rather answer those questions that relate to this case and not questions relating to Zigiranyirazo's case, Mr. President.  I am saying this because that's what I believe.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, and your position is abundantly clear, Mr. Witness.  And you have to bear with us, because we will now proceed.  

And what is your next reference, Counsel?  Which page should we now look at in the transcripts?  What is the next portion of the transcript?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Page 8, Mr. President.  Transcript of Monday, 30 January 2006.  Page 8.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, please proceed.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, I want to read out a few excerpts for your attention.  On that day, this is the question that counsel put to you:  "The two policemen -- you said that you had seen two policemen during that day.  Aren't you sure that there were four of them?"  Your answer, Witness:  "I went around with two policemen, but there were two other policemen at the préfectoral office.  That makes a total of four.  But when I went around, most of the time it was in the company of those two policemen.  Otherwise, two policemen were at the préfectoral office."  

Then, Witness, counsel puts another question to you relating to the number of policemen, and reminds you of what you had mentioned in your statement.  Then counsel goes on to ask the following question:  "Is that indeed what you said to the Prosecutor?"  And this is your answer:  "On the 7th, when I went to Rose Karushara's residence, I arrived the premises of -- at the level of Radio Rwanda in the company of two policemen.  He went into the premises of the radio station and then *********** on to Karushara's residence with two policemen.  If reference has been made to four policemen, that must be a mistake.  I said two policemen."  

Do you remember that those were your statements and that that was the correction you made?  
A.	Counsel, I have a question for you:  You say that I said a policeman went into the radio, or was it Renzaho?  No, I never said that.  I said -- and I have already explained in relation to the two policemen, that the number went from two to four.  And I have provided that explanation.  I never said that a policeman went to the radio station.  He could not have left ************** to enter the premises of the radio station.  So I never said any such thing.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, let us go to page 9.  On page 9 the witness makes the following comments:  "Let me repeat what I have said."  And that will be paragraph 26.  "It has already been my testimony that there were four policemen at the préfectoral office.  That whenever I went around, it was with two out of those four policemen.  I never went around with four policemen.  However, there were four of them at the préfectoral office.  But I always went around in the company of two policemen."  

Then a question -- another question is put to him:  "Yes, you seem to remember that very clearly.  So you are not mistaken, Witness?  Isn't it so?"  Answer:  "Yes, I do confirm."  Conclusion by Counsel:  "So, the Prosecutor made a mistake four times; isn't it so?"  And the witness answers:  "Yes, it is correct.  Because I had explained to them that there was a total of four policemen at the préfectoral office, that when ********** around it was only in the company of two of them."  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Now, Witness, do you remember having had this kind of question/answer session with the counsel, Witness?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you hear the question, Mr. Witness?  It was whether you remember this exchange from the previous trial.  That's all.  It can be answered with a yes or no.  Do you remember?  
THE WITNESS: 
What did you say?  I no longer understand anything.  My equipment is not working.  

I hear you, but very faintly.  Not at all.  There's a problem.  I can't hear.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence counsel, are there other excerpts in connection with this issue, or was that the last part of the transcripts that you wanted to deal with in this area concerning two versus four police officers?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
I am done with the reference to the number of policemen, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  Mr. Witness, we have now noted what was said during the previous trial, where you gave testimony concerning the number of police officers.  And it could be argued that there is a contradiction between what you are saying here and what you were saying there.  Do you have any final comment as to this apparent contradiction, so that we can move on?  
THE WITNESS: 
On that point, Mr. President, regarding the policemen, I have already said it several times; it is true that in that other case -- or, in this case, the question has been put to me about the two policemen who had come from a different secteur.  I told the Court already that those two had gone back and other policemen were assigned to work with me, and they were four in number.  Four of them worked with me.  It is true that in the previous trial, a question -- questions were put to me on the number of police persons, and I noticed that the Defence counsel is using them to claim that I had said that there were only two policemen.  But I had provided further explanations to clarify the issue that there were four policemen in total.  Because the counsel who put those questions to me in that other case was also claiming that there were two, but at the end of it all, we understood that there were four in number.  I could not confuse two for four, whereas those people were with me.  This is all I can say, and I thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  On the 7th of April 1994, can you confirm that on that day you went to Rose Karushara's after ********************* Mr. Renzaho to the radio house?  
A.	Yes, I agree with you.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We are very close to the 11 o'clock break.  Before we take that break, do we agree that Bucyogo is spelt B-U-C-Y-O-G-O?  Prosecution?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
I'm sorry, I fear I might have missed the reference to that.  Could Your Honour assist?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I'm now trying to clarify some pending issues in the transcripts.  Do we agree that the location mentioned by the witness yesterday was Bucyogo, spelt B-U-C-Y-O-G-O?  

Is that the correct spelling, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS: 
It is Biryogo.  Biryogo.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That will be spelt B-I-R-Y-O-G-O, spelling from the Kinyarwanda booth.  B-I-R-Y-O-G-O.  Biryogo.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  

Then we had a place close to Gitega, a neighbouring secteur, to Bigobo, is that B-I-G-O-B-O?  How do you spell that, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS: 
Once again it is Biryogo, B-I-R-Y-O-G-O.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Number 14 on the spelling list.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So it's the same.  That's noted.  

Would this be a convenient moment for the break, Defence?  We will then have the 11 o'clock break and we will resume at 11:25.  

The Court is adjourned.  
(Court recessed from 1100H to 1132H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
There is a slight delay because of a technical problem, I understand.  

Now, the next question.  Please proceed.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Obliged, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, before our morning recess, you confirmed that it was after ************************************* with Mr. Renzaho to the radio station ******************************************* the lady conseiller of Kimisagara secteur.  Am I correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Witness, kindly remind me of what the exact time was?  
A.	It was around 10 o'clock.  
Q.	Thank you.  How far away is the home of the lady conseiller de secteur from the radio station; do you remember?  
A.	The round trip would be three kilometres.  Or perhaps two.  
Q.	You said three kilometres or two.  Can you be more specific than that, Witness?  
A.	The round trip is less than three kilometres. 
Q.	Thank you.  When you went to look for her, **************************************************************? 
A.	*****************************************************************************************************************
           *************************************** 
Q.	Thank you.  And you did not encounter any form of barrier, any obstacle on the road?  
A.	No, none.  I told you I was accompanied by policemen in an official vehicle with official number plates.  And on the vehicle it was even written that it was a state-owned vehicle.  So no one could stand in our way.  
Q.	Witness, if I were to put it to you that the distance between Radio Rwanda and Kimisagara, round trip, is eight kilometres, what would you say?  
A.	That is not correct, Counsel.  That is not correct.  ************** for 25 years in Kigali-ville and I know all the roads in Kigali much better than you may.  I don't even know the roads you're referring to, and I wonder if you know what you're referring to yourself.  Even if you were to call somebody in Kigali today and ask them to give an estimate of the distance between the radio house and Karushara's residence, that person would give you that distance.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Listen, are we talking about round trips or one way here?  We have used the word "round trips" all the time.  If you were now, Mr. Witness, to tell us the distance between these two locations, one way, what is it, in your estimate?  
THE WITNESS: 
About one-and-a-half kilometres.  At least less than three kilometres, whatever the case may be.  One way, one-and-a-half kilometres.  I would say even less than that.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, could you describe that route in much more detail, that is, from the Kigali-ville préfecture to the residence of the secteur conseiller? 
A.	Do you want me to tell you about the itinerary?  Well, this is what I said.  You leave the radio, you go to Ndiro (phonetic), then you go past the prison, and then you get to the roundabout, and then you go to Nyabugogo where Karushara's residence was located.  That is about 100 kilometres (sic) on foot. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Can you repeat your estimate, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS: 
It is a rather short distance, Mr. President, to go from the conseiller's residence.  It is a rather short distance from downtown.  The distance cannot be up to two kilometres.  It is less than one-and-a-half kilometres. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you made a reference to a distance to be made on foot.  What was your estimate, please?  
THE WITNESS: 
From what location to what location?  I didn't talk about any distance being covered on foot.  I was referring to distances covered in a vehicle, Mr. President.  If you left the Nyabugogo traffic lights, then you would get to that distance as I have already mentioned.  And the distance, as I have said, is rather quite short to Karushara's house. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  So there was a communication error here between the two versions.  That's noted.  

Next question, please?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I would like to clarify issues between the witness and myself, and in so doing I would like to show him this map of Kigali-ville so that he can show us ************************ from the PVK to Kimisagara. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could someone draw the curtains, meanwhile, please?  We will have to ask the witness to move.  
THE WITNESS: 
I am not able to read maps.  I have told you the itinerary which I followed, and you who are able to read those maps, please go on and read them and you would understand what I am talking about.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  If that's the case, registry, instead of proceeding with the curtains, could you give the witness the map just to confirm that he cannot read it.  
THE WITNESS: 
I am not able to read maps, Mr. President.  I have just told you.  If you can show me the road from the radio house, if you can see the radio house on the map, maybe I can help you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  So then we should make an attempt after all.  Why don't we then move the map to the area of the projector, and...  

All right.  Defence counsel, you want to have this exchange with the witness?  We may not get anything out of it, but you want to make an attempt?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, the witness said that he is not able to read any maps.  I take note of that, and maybe I will move on to something else.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  So in spite of his additional remark, you are refraining from pursuing it.  That's noted, then we move on.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Obliged, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, how long did it take you to cover that small distance?  That is, how long did it take you to do the round trip?  
A.	About ten minutes.  Counsel, I believe that there is somebody near you who knows the area very well; that is Mr. Renzaho.  Just put the question to him about that distance.  He knows it very well.  He is sitting close to you, and he has been on that road.  And if you put the question to him gently, slowly, he will answer you.  If you whisper it to him, he will answer you.  

I have heard you talk about a number of kilometres, Counsel.  Please, what -- how many kilometres did you refer to, Counsel?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, I assume that there has been consultation between the Accused and the client, so don't worry about that, Mr. Witness.  

Here follows the next question.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Merci bien, Monsieur le President. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, after those ten minutes the conseiller and Mr. Renzaho are with you at the PVK, is it with them that you go to the Hotel Diplomat? 
A.	With who?  Who are you talking about, going to the Hôtel des Diplomates with the conseiller?  No, no, I did not.  But I think I have already mentioned this before, and I don't know whether you did not understand.  When we got to the préfectoral office, the préfet was already there.  And I never said that she went along with the préfet.  I don't know what you are seeking to determine in your line of examination, and I don't know what you -- whether you were listening when I was answering.  
Q.	What did you say, specifically, Witness?  
A.	Are you still talking about the movements or trips of roads, the conseiller?  Well, what I said was that we took roads to the préfectoral office where we found that the préfet had already arrived at the office.  But I never went with the conseiller to the Hôtel des Diplomates.  I don't know why you are revisiting this question.  I am certain that you understood what I had said previously.  
Q.	With whom did you go to the Hôtel des Diplomates, specifically?  
A.	I have already answered clearly.  I went to the Hôtel des Diplomates with four policemen.  And I was *****************.  That has already been my testimony.  Renzaho was in our convoy, but in his own vehicle.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, it's -- it's inevitable that there is repetition in the course of the testimony.  So everyone here is listening very carefully to your testimony, and all we want to achieve is efficient communication, clarity, and precision.  So don't worry, we are listening carefully, including Defence counsel.  

Here follows the next question.  

BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Is it correct to say that you left Rose Karushara at the préfectoral office? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  She remained at the préfectoral office, along with other figures of authority who were there.  She was not alone, almost all the conseillers and bourgmestres of Kigali-ville were there. 
Q.	Witness, do you describe your activities differently, depending on the case in which you testify, or do you always describe them in the same manner?  
A.	All trials are not the same, and trials do not resemble each other, in much the same way as the accused are different in one case to another.  So the proceedings in various cases differ.  If I had provided a specific answer to a question in Zigiranyirazo's case, the same question would not be put to me in Renzaho's case, because these are two different trials; Zigiranyirazo was a politician and Renzaho was a préfet, and each one of them acted differently.  So I may say the same thing in one case or the other, but the answers that I provide depend on the question.  If you are a woman, I cannot go on to say that you were a man.  Renzaho did what he did, Zigiranyirazo did what he did, and therefore you cannot ask me whether I just tell the story according to the trial.  Counsel, what do you really want me to answer?  
Q.	Very well.  Very well, Witness.  Let me remind you of what you said pertaining to your activities of the 7th, specifically about your trip to Rose's house on the 7th of April 1994, and I'm relating to your testimony in Zigiranyirazo case.  And it is for this reason that I observe that your testimony varies from one case to the next.  Do you want me to remind you of what you said in that other case?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, let's be precise now.  Which page do you want us to look at, Counsel?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Page 10, Mr. President, of the French version.  

By the way, I have requested for copies of the English version.  Unfortunately the copies are not here yet, Mr. President.  That is why we must continue to work with the French version only so far.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's fine.  But now the date -- now the date of the transcript.  You said page 10, but of the 26th or the 30th?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
26th January, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  Which portion?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
I simply want to recall paragraphs 22 to 37.  It won't be long, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay, go ahead.  But I hope you don't have to read it all.  Let's start.  

MR. NEKUIE: 
I am not going to read, but I simply want to recall that it is Judge Muthoga who puts questions to -- to the witness as to the return trip.  And this is the witness's answer:  "We left Hôtel des Diplomates, went through the radio house, and then on to the préfectoral office."  Then later on the question is put to him as follows:  "From Hôtel des Diplomates, did you go directly to the préfectoral office, or did you go elsewhere?"  And the answer is:  "No, we stopped nowhere else.  We went directly."  

And then the question is put to him:  "When you arrived at the préfectoral office -- when you arrived the préfectoral office, can you tell us what happened?"  And this is the answer, and it is the answer I would like the Court to pay attention to, that is, the witness's answer:  "Once we got to the office, the firearms were offloaded.  They were put into an office.  I remained on the premises and shortly thereafter he talked to the policemen."  And the "he" apparently refers to Mr. Renzaho.  "It was past 12.  He told them to go and see the conseiller of Kimisagara secteur."  

And then on page 11 he concludes as follows:  "We therefore went to fetch her and we brought her back to the préfectoral office."  That is what I wanted to draw the witness's attention to.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Now, Witness, do you remember that as being your testimony?  
A.	Counsel, I did not quite follow what you read.  Please, could you read it again and mention specifically the location to which I went after Hôtel des Diplomates, and before I got to the Hôtel des Diplomates, where was I?  Could you please repeat that excerpt, and then I will be in a position to answer your question relating to the fact that I went to fetch Karushara at 2 p.m. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says the witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
So I never said any such thing.  I would like you to tell me about that point where I went to Hôtel des Diplomates and I went to Kimisagara to look for Rose Karushara.  I never said that.  I never said that.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, Counsel, what is the alleged discrepancy between this testimony and the testimony in the present trial?  Can you draw the attention of the witness to that, please? 
MR. NEKUIE: 
That is what I am trying to bring to the attention of the witness, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Now, Witness, it has been your testimony here that in the morning -- from the morning, ************-- or, followed Mr. Renzaho to the radio house, and then thereafter went directly ****************************** her back to the préfectoral office.  But from your testimony of the 26th, it emerges that you went to the Hôtel des Diplomates first of all with Mr. Renzaho, and that weapons were loaded, and then the weapons were brought back to the préfectoral office, and it is at that time that Mr. Renzaho came out, at about 12, and ordered you *************** Madam Rose Karushara.  How do you explain that discrepancy of the versions of the same facts?  
A.	I have already told you previously that I did not *********** Rose Karushara in the afternoon.  In the previous trial, I testified that I had left with Renzaho around 2 p.m.  I did not say that I went with Renzaho to Rose's house.  You see, I have never said, either, that I went to Rose at 2 p.m.  I said, simply, that I went to Rose Kabuye -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Kabuye, the witness says. 
THE WITNESS: 
-- I said that I went there at 2 p.m.  I have never mentioned any Rose Kabuye. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
In the witness's words.  
THE WITNESS: 
You see, I am not the one who drafts the transcripts of this Tribunal.  Maybe there was a mistake somewhere.  I have never made any such statement.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I am referring to Rose Karushara.  There is no Rose Kabuye.  
A.	Yes, it is Rose Karushara, indeed, not Rose Kabuye. 
Q.	Is it your testimony that you have never testified that you ******************* her after 12 p.m.?  
A.	I never went ******* her in the afternoon of the 7th.  I said that I went ********** her before 10 a.m.  That has been my testimony consistently.  
Q.	Therefore, your statement of the 26th January 2006, in that connection -- or, including such a statement will be incorrect; is it so?  
A.	Well, what you're saying, Counsel, is not correct.  What I said is that I ****************** her before noon.  So what you are saying is not correct, and I don't know where you get that from.  There may have been a mistake in the transcripts.  So I would like you to read those transcripts carefully, Counsel.  
Q.	Yes, I will read them carefully, Witness.  But for now, let me ask you to tell us how it is that on the 7th of April you paid no attention to the person who was your employer at that time?  You had no worries about that person?  You'd had no concerns about that person?  Can you talk to us about that?  
A.	I worried about my employer, and I even tried to make a phone call but couldn't get through.  I don't know if you follow.  What I am saying, Counsel, is that I tried to contact that person on the phone, but the phone lines were busy.  What you should ask me instead is why I did not go to look for that person physically.  Counsel, do you know where that person lived, so that you may understand why I was not able to go visit that person physically?  Before you question my lack of concern about my employer, maybe you should say what you think about this question, then I will be able to answer you.  
(Pages 15 to 31 by Kirstin McLean)





































1200H 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	When and at what time did you attempt to call that person?  
A.	I have asked you a question, Counsel.  Maybe you could have asked me why I did not go to see that person physically.  And then I went on to ask you whether you knew that person's address.  Now, when you will give me that person's address, then I'll be able to answer your question.  
Q.	Witness, I am the one putting questions to you here.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  And that's true.  

Now, did you tell us, Mr. Witness, that there may have been a mistake in the transcripts in the previous trial?  That was your testimony, wasn't it?
THE WITNESS:
No, Mr. President.  That is not what I said.  I did not say there were mistakes in the transcript.  I simply said that maybe it is the counsel who may have made mistakes in transcribing my testimony.  Because in my testimony, I said clearly that I went to Rose's house in the morning hours.  And it is the Defence counsel, in his interpretation of my statements, who made the mistake.  

Now, regarding the question he asked about why I wasn't concerned about the fate of my employer, I have asked the Defence counsel whether he knows the address of my employer.  If he did, then let him say so before going on to ask me why I wasn't concerned about my employer's fate. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  And he may wish to continue the dialogue with you on that point.  But now we have an exchange, you and I.  And my question to you now, as a follow-up, is:  Let us suppose that the transcripts support the version given by counsel.  Would that mean that if we were to play the tape in Kinyarwanda of your testimony in the previous trial, we would find the version you are saying you gave in that trial?  Is that the correct interpretation of your testimony?  
THE WITNESS:
In my previous testimony, I said that I ************* Rose Karushara at 10 a.m.  That has been my position today.  There is no other version.  It is only on the 8th of April that I went to Karushara's house at 2 p.m.  Furthermore, I would like to ask Defence counsel -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please stop.  Please, Mr. Witness.  We don't really need these questions to Defence counsel.  But now we would wish to hear Defence counsel's next question to you.  So what is that question, please?   
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I was seeking an answer from the witness as to when and where he attempted to call his employer.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you get that question, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I understood the question.  Defence counsel is asking me to tell him where I called my employer. 

But I think he should rather have asked me whether I notified my employer of the fact that I was using his vehicle.  This is the answer I will provide.  The last time I saw my employer was on the 6th of April in the day, at about 6 p.m.  And I did not have access to his residence, because he lived in Kicukiro.  And that is where the fight was taking place.  I, therefore, was not in a position to go to Kicukiro.  

When I called, the lines were busy.  And I never saw my former boss again from that day until today.  That is my answer.
JUDGE ARREY:
Yes.  Counsel, a point of clarification, since you've been asking questions about the dates, the time that he went to Rose's house.  

On page 11 of the same transcript, I see something that supports his version that he did say they went there in the morning.  Because look at the last answer, line 36.  It says that, after they had collected her, "We arrived her residence at about 13 hours.  We left the residence at about 5 p.m.  Then she collected arms.  And it was that we were discussing about the killings."  

So the witness is right that they did go there the first time in the morning.  After she had collected the arms, they took her back and go to her house around 1 p.m., and stayed there until 5 p.m.

The same transcript that you are referring to, so I don't know whether you saw that section.  So, Counsel, go to a different line of cross-examination.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Your Honour, for your comments.  But I believe that what I said was, also, correct in respect of the witness's testimony relating to his trip to Rose Karushara's residence.  

Your Honour, if you look at page 9 of the transcript in French, you will see that he is referring to the 7th at 10 a.m.  From 10 a.m. the first trip of the witness with Mr. Renzaho -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Which line are we in now on page 9, so that we can all follow it?  It's number 12?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Line 11 and 12.  And it's Judge Khan who puts a question to the witness.  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
If we look at the witness's itinerary from 10 a.m. that day, it emerges that he first goes to Hotel des Diplomates behind Mr. Renzaho's vehicle where weapons are loaded.  After the weapons are loaded -- and that is all contained in page 10 -- then they return to the préfectoral office, the PVK.  And it is after offloading the weapons, line 35, page 10, after the weapons are offloaded -- that is, the weapons that had been collected at Hotel des  Diplomates -- it is already past 12.  And it is at that time that Mr. Renzaho for the first time asks them to go bring Madam Rose Karushara. 

Whereas, in his testimony here, the witness has, rather, testified that they went to collect Mrs. Rose Karushara in the morning while Mr. Renzaho was at the radio house.  

Those are the contradictions, Mr. President.  Then it is only when Ms. Rose Karushara is at the PVK that they then go to the préfectoral office, and then bring them back to PVK, giving part of the weapons to Madam Rose Karushara.  

These are the contradictions that arise from his testimonies in the two cases we are referring to.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, Mr. Witness, you have listened to this exchange.  Do you have anything to add before we move on?  
THE WITNESS:
All I can say is that Defence counsel himself is altering his own versions.  Because a short while ago he said that I went to Karushara's house at 2 p.m.  And in this last comment, he says that I went to Karushara after I had gone ********** the weapons.  So I think those are two different versions.  

All I can tell him is that I went there at 10 a.m.  But he has continued to alter the versions.  

But let me say that between my first testimony and today, given the time that has elapsed, I might have made a mistake.  But, Mr. President, even if I were mistaken somewhere, all I know is that within those time frames we had shipped weapons.  I can understand if Defence counsel claims something to the effect that we did not transport any weapons.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, one last question for the witness to clarify this point once and for all. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Question:  Did you **************** Mrs. Rose before going to Hotel des  Diplomates with Mr. Renzaho?  Or did you ****************** her after you had been to Hotel des Diplomates?  
A.	This is what I have been telling you.  We went to fetch Rose Karushara.  We went to fetch Rose Karushara after we had been to Hotel des Diplomates.  Or rather, we went to Hotel des  Diplomates after we had collected Karushara.  Maybe I was mistaken as to the time that I mentioned.  But this is what happened at that time on that date.  We did not go to Rose Karushara's house at 2 p.m.  It was after the meeting at 1 p.m. in the afternoon that we went to Rose Karushara's house.
Q.	On the 7th of April 1994, Witness, when and from what location did you call, or did you attempt to call your employer?  
A.	Counsel, do you want me to tell you all the houses where there was a phone?  I have told you already that I called him, but his line was busy.  I, therefore, do not see the relevance of your question.  

Well, please explain to the Court how relevant this question is.  What do you want to bring to the attention of the judges?  And what could I have done for him?  I, therefore, do not find it relevant that you continue to ask me questions about the fate of my boss.  I have already told you that I called him, but his line was busy.  And that fight was raging in the neighbourhood where he lived.  

You can put the question to your client.  He was in charge of the préfecture, and he knows exactly what was going on.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All we are interested in here, Mr. Witness, is to listen to answers to questions.  We are not interested in argumentation.  Now, what is the next question?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, he did not answer that question.  I put a simple question to him to know when and from where he made the attempt to call his former employer.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness's microphone's off.  
THE WITNESS:
That is a question I've already answered.  I told you I placed the phone call when I went home in the evening.  Don't think that we did not have phone lines.  I had a phone line at home.  I placed a call, but I realized that his line was engaged.  And I could not physically go to his home because he lived in Kicukiro, and that is where fight was raging.  So no one could enter that neighbourhood.  

You can ask your client, and he himself will give you the same answer.  That is all I can tell you regarding my former boss.  And let me remind you that ever since 6th of April until this day, I have never seen him.  I don't even know whether he's still alive, or whether he's dead.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Did you set up roadblocks in your secteur on the 7th of April 1994? 
A.	Who is that question addressed to, counsel?  Or it is in reference to who?  
Q.	That question is addressed to you, Witness.  
A.	Do you want to know whether roadblocks were erected?  Or whether I erected roadblocks. 
Q.	I am referring to you personally, Witness.  
A.	Personally, I set up a roadblock, but it was not really on the road.  It was on a path leading to my home.  And I acknowledge the existence of that block.  I did it on my own initiative.  

And that roadblock was mentioned during the information gathering process in the Gacaca proceedings.  It was on that occasion that I acknowledge having set up a barrier ************************.  
Q.	Witness, did you kill Tutsis at that roadblock?
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, sir, I think Defence counsel should be prevented from putting such questions to me because I am not standing trial here.  I'm here as a witness.  If he wants to try me, then he rather go to Rwanda and investigate to ascertain whether there was a Tutsi who died at that roadblock.  I'm here as a witness, not as an accused.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
According to Rule 90(E) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, Mr. Witness, a witness may refuse to make any statement which might tend to incriminate him.  

The Chamber may, however, compel the witness to answer the question.  Testimony compelled in this way shall not be used as evidence in a subsequent Prosecution against the witness for any offense other than perjury.  

This is the legal situation.  Having now explained the legal situation for you, do you want to answer that question?  Or would you wish not to answer Defence counsel's question?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, it seems that question comes from you.  And after having explained to me that -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I did not ask you that question.  I'm not asking you any question now.  What I'm doing is simply to say that we have rules about this.  When someone is asking a witness a question which could incriminate the witness, then the Bench will inform the witness of the legal situation.  

What I just said did not imply any inclination on the part of the Bench whether you should answer it or not.  That is now your decision.  All I did was to inform you of the legal situation.  

Did you understand me now?  Just answer "yes" or "no", please.  
THE WITNESS:
I have understood you, sir.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Having understood what I just did, the question I'm asking you now is, you were asked a question; you did not answer it.  Do you maintain that refusal to answer it?  Is that your answer?  
THE WITNESS:
My answer to him was that he could not put such a question to me.  That such a question can be put to me only in connection with the cases in Rwanda.  I simply acknowledged having set up a roadblock.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, I am putting it to you that during that period from the 6th of April 1994, you never met Mr. Renzaho.  You were never in contact with him.  What do you have to say?  
A.	Did you say on the 6th of April?  How could I have met him on the 6th of April?  I hereby confirm that I did not at all meet with him on the 6th of April.  
Q.	Neither did you meet with him on the 7th, the 8th, the 9th or the 10th, or even the subsequent days in April, 1994.  What do you have to say, sir? 
A.	I saw him regularly.  I did not discuss with him, but I saw him on a daily basis from the 7th to the 13th of April.  I did not say that I did not see him.  I did see him.  But we did not discuss. 
Q.	You never followed him in his Renault 21 vehicle.  That is my proposition to you.  What do you have to say? 
A.	Do you mean from the 7th of April when I arrived at the préfecture office I never followed him?  Well, let me tell you this, Counsel.  I'm just explaining one matter to you.  

Look at me, Counsel.  I have two eyes, two ears.  So I was able to see things and hear. 

When one have eyes and cannot hear, then one is disabled (sic).  But with me it is different.  I have my eyes, and my ears.  Are you suggesting that I was able to see his vehicle and I could not make it out?  I think that you should not put such a proposition that I never saw him.  I have perfect sight.  Perfect hearing.  But you, what you are saying, are things which you heard from others.  But I was there.  You've heard things which you were told about.  But did you not go down to there to see for yourself.  It is even highly likely that you do not know Kigali.  Because if you are familiar with Kigali, you would not have claimed that I did not see Renzaho from the 7th of April.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So in brief, the witness is maintaining his previous answers.  

Next question?  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, when did you first see Colonel Kabiligi during that period?  
A.	I said I first saw him at Hotel des Diplomates. 
Q.	On what date, Witness?  
A.	Read the transcript before you put such a question to me.  Refer to the passage where the date is mentioned.  I have already stated that it was on the 7th.  Now, if you know of a different date, then kindly tell the Court.  
Q.	Did you not state that you first saw him at another date than the 7th of April 1994?  
A.	Counsel, let us try and refresh our mutual recollection.  You see, you are allowed by the rules to put questions.  But sometimes you put irrelevant and repetitive questions.  I said I first saw him at Hotel des  Diplomates.  Now, you are asking me if I did not say I had seen him at another date.  

Let me tell you that Kabiligi was a soldier.  But the first time I saw him was between the 7th and the 12th.  I told you that I saw Kabiligi. 
Q.	I have duly noted, Witness, that you first saw him on the 7th.  Is that your evidence?  The 7th of April, 1994?  
A.	But what else do you want to know?  You put questions to me regarding something you have closely followed.  I first saw him on the 7th of April at the Hotel des Diplomates.  What else do you want?  
Q.	Witness, allow me to read to you an excerpt of your statement of the 30th of November 2004,  recorded by the representative of the Office of the Prosecutor on this particular point.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, Your Honours, it is the statement of 30th of November 2004. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, it is the beginning of paragraph 3.  It is your supplemental statement concerning Colonel  Renzaho and Gratien Kabiligi.  That is the heading of your statement.  In paragraph 3 this is what you say:  

"I first saw him at Hotel des Diplomates on the 10th of April 1994, but I did not know him."  And you added as follows:  "After that, I saw him on the 12th of April 1994 around 2 p.m. at the Kigali-ville préfecture office." 

How do you explain the inconsistency between your statement of 2004 and what you are asserting to right now regarding the date when you first saw Colonel Gratien Kabiligi?  
A.	I had said this before.  Let me repeat it.  Various people put questions to me.  Those people could have been mistaken regarding the investigations of my conduct.  And this is a supplemental statement.  What is the meaning of supplemental, Counsel?  It means it concerns certain things which are remembered subsequently.  Otherwise in all my statements, I said I saw Kabiligi on the 7th.  

Regarding this supplemental statement, you ought to know that I gave it and I hereby acknowledge it.  But from the beginning, I had said that I saw Kabiligi at Hotel des Diplomates on the 7th.  

Furthermore, Kabiligi is not standing trial here now in this court.  I may have seen him at this other location.  Otherwise, I saw him for the first time on the 7th of April in the morning at Hotel des  Diplomates.  
Q.	Witness, what should we understand regarding what you are saying about Mr. Kabiligi?  Is it what you had said before?  Or what you said in your supplemental statement?  Or is it what you have said in your testimony today?  
A.	You should retain what I said in my first statement.  I don't even understand the supplemental statement.  Peruse my first statement, and try and compare the versions.  If the versions are identical, then indeed I said all those things. 

Look at my supplemental statement and compare it with the first statement I give.  

Listen, the people recording the statement may be mistaken.  Because I did not ask them questions regarding what was recorded.  They need to tell you that.
Q.	So is it your evidence that those who recorded your supplemental statement were mistaken?  
A.	That is a possibility.  To err is human, sir.  
Q.	Was it a mistake, or not?  You should be more specific regarding your supplemental statement.  And let me remind you that your signature is on it.  
A.	Yes.  I signed the supplemental statement.  I'm now telling you that I did not take time to read the various statements I gave.  I have referred you to my first statement telling you that if you did not find on that first statement that I said I saw Kabiligi on the 7th of April, then you would say that I am lying.  You should consult that first statement.  Then you consult the supplemental statement, and you make the comparison.  
Q.	Witness, are you a professional witness?  
A.	Counsel, that is funny.  I am not a professional witness.  That is why I say you are just mocking at me in all what you are saying.  But let me ask you this question:  Are you fooling around with me?  You are not putting questions to me.  You are just trying to make me look like a laughing stock.  Now you're asking me if I am a professional witness.  How about a criminal?  Has he made criminal activities a profession?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We would really wish to focus on evidence.  Are there any other evidentiary matters the Court should be appraised of?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, that actually was the ultimate question I had for this witness.  Now I rest.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you have any documents to tender as exhibits in connection with your cross-examination?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, indeed, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You may be referring to the transcripts which we now have in both versions; both English and French. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Absolutely, Mr. President.  Also, to the witness statements of 22nd of December 2003, and 30th of November 2004. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  Shall we start with the transcripts?  Do you want all the pages from the Zigiranyirazo trial exhibited?  With other words, all the pages that you have provided to the Bench?  Or only those pages which you actively used?  You want them all for context, is that so?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
I'm going to refer to the relevant pages which should be choosing (sic), Mr. President.  They are pages 9 of the court hearing of Thursday, 26th of January 2006.  Pages 9, 10, 11 of 26th of January 2006.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And in addition, page 8, which you also used, plus the front page.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Quite so, Mr. President.  Mr. President, I am a bit lost in all the papers I have before me, because I was using them during the cross-examination.  And in order to avoid wasting the Court's time, I think I am going to request that all the transcripts be entered.  And subsequently, I will indicate to you the pages I referred to.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  As the next exhibit, we will then enter the relevant parts of the transcripts that we have in front of us.  And we will make a final determination after having received the indications by Defence counsel as to which portions he really wants to use.  

Because you are saying that subsequently you want to indicate the pages you referred to.  Does that mean you want to be more precise later?  Or do you want it in en block now?  We may also have the Prosecution's reexamination.  

Are you going to address these pages, Prosecution?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
No, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  So come back to us exactly what you want.  But the next exhibit number will then be, Mr. Mussa?
MR. MUSSA:
Your Honours, it is D. 1.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
A for the French and B for the English.  
 (Exhibit No.  D. 1A and D. 1B, admitted)
Mr. PRESIDENT:
All right.  And then next document?  You said the 22nd of December.  Was that so?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
That's correct, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Any objection?  No objection.  The French version will be 2A as it is the original signed by the witness, and the English version 2B.  
(Exhibit No. D. 2A and D. 2B admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
And then -- you may wish to tender also the document of the 30th of November about the Kabiligi portion.  Is that also your wish?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
That's right. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
3A and B.  A being the French as signed by the witness.  
(Exhibit No. D. 3A and D. 3B admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any other document?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
That is all, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  Re-examination?  

Mr. Mussa and Judge Arrey are very kindly reminding me that you also used the 30th of November transcripts.  So don't you want that portion exhibited?  Now you have only identified the pages in the 26th January -- I meant January, not November.  So you referred to the portions from the 26th of January, but you also proceeded with the second day of the witness testimony in Mr. Zig's case.  And you may wish to also enter those portions.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I thought I had already entered all the transcripts of the witness's testimony on the 26th and the 30 of January 2006.  All of the transcripts, as Exhibit D. 1.  I used excerpts thereof.  But in order for me to avoid any mistakes, I decided to tender all the transcripts of the witness's testimony in the Zigiranyirazo case.  
THE PRESIDENT:
But perhaps you did that in French and not in English.  That is the problem.  Because in English we discussed only the 26th, but now we know full well that you proposed to tender the two versions of the transcripts.  That is noted.  We are referring to the entire transcript.  Is that correct?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Well, Mr. President, what I can propose is that subsequently I will avail the Court with precise information regarding the portions which I used and which I will hand to the registry in the French and the English versions.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We take it all in.  So that you don't have to worry more about it.  What you gave us, we take in.  And we note that you referred only to some portions of it.  And then the matter is settled.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
I thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  Re-examination. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you, Your Honour.
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in respect to the period from the 6th of April to the 17th of July, 1994, have you been accused in Rwanda, or elsewhere, of any crime?  
A.	I have never been accused.  
MS. MELLUISH:
Thank you.  I have no further questions.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, that was the end of your testimony.  We would like to thank you for having come the long way to testify in this trial.  Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  We wish you a very safe journey home.  Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
Stay in peace in Arusha, Mr. President.  I thank you.  
(Witness excused) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Prosecution, the next witness is UL?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What are the page references in the binders?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
I'm sorry, Your Honour.  I haven't got them in hand right at the moment.  I should say as yesterday the Defence indicated that -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We are aware that we cannot begin this witness until after the lunch break, based on the schedule we decided on now.  So what we are simply doing now is to sort out some administrative matters in order to use the time efficiently until we adjourn a bit earlier.  And then we start again, as always, at 2:30. 

Now the page references, please?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
If Your Honour will give me a moment, I will look them up for you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  Then, Defence Counsel, you, yesterday, when you asked for an adjournment of the trial, you referred to three judgements of detained witnesses where you said that translation problems would occur.  

I'm not certain that the Bench have these three judgements.  Just in order to ensure that we can foresee already at this stage any practical problems that may arise, and in order to see whether we, the Bench can do anything of an administrative matter to facilitate things, could you make those three judgements available to us?  Either you or the Prosecution?  If you are going to use them during cross-examination. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I will allow lead counsel to answer you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And let me stress that this is only an attempt to avoid problems.  That's the initiative here.  You are free to follow this up, or not.  It is a question of facilitation if the Bench can do anything.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Regarding Witness UL, we have one judgement which was disclosed to us as part of the judicial disclosures.  That judgement is in Kinyarwanda.  We've perused it, and to us it doesn't seem essential for the cross-examination which I am going to handle.  That is the first answer regarding Witness UL. 

We have a second witness, UB, about whom there are two judgements in Rwandan courts -- judgement at the first instance on appeal.  We received a disclosure only in the Kinyarwanda, and we were interested in the content of those judgements, and we were able to get a French copy thereof.  

Right now, I am thinking about the other documents.  Regarding Witness ALG, we received the disclosure of these bulky judicial files.  And there is a decision which, for us, is of importance to the Court.  And it is the one in which the Prosecutor turned down that witness's confession and guilty plea. 

Mr. President, we're talking about the organic law of 30 August 1996 in Rwanda here.  That decision is not in -- it's not yet been translated.  It is part of the files, but has not been translated yet.  

I'm sorry, Mr. President.  A moment or two for me to consult my assistant.  

Mr. President, I will have to review my notes to ascertain whether there is no other decision regarding another witness.  I don't have everything in my mind right now.  Yesterday it was fresher.  You see I don't have the same memory as witnesses.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you for that clarification.  Now, when it comes to Witness UL, that document seemed unproblematic because, A, it was unlikely to be used for impeachment purposes, as explained by Mr. Moses yesterday.  And, B, because it was relatively brief.  And you have confirmed that that is not the problem.  

So the three judgements I was referring to were the two judgements, then, I understand, from Witness  UB; and one judgement, possibly more, from Witness ALG.  These are, then, the three problematic documents, possibly, in terms of translation.  That's how I understand you. 

Now, when it comes to the two judgements of Witness UB, are they both first instance judgements?  Or is there one first instance and one second instance judgement from Witness UB?  
MR. CANTIER: 
That is right, Mr. President.  One judgement in the first instance, and a ruling of the appeals court in Kigali regarding UB.  

We have the translations of the two.  But only in French.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So that disposes of the problems in relation to two of the judgements.  You, in fact, have a French version of both these two judgement.  That's excellent news.  This means that what we have to focus on now is the judgement in the ALG file.  And if you want to come back to us on that, we will be willing to listen attentively to see whether there are any problems that we should address.  But you can do that after the break or at the end of the day.  That's -- the timing is yours.  
MR. CANTIER: 
We can discuss it now, Mr. President.  Just a clarification.  Regarding UL, Mr. President, the judgement is 30 pages thick.  I don't know why they talk about five pages, but it's 30 pages.  

The second problem.  You see, the Defence is of the view that the document is not indispensable for cross-examination.  But a question is the importance of the judgement.  And that is even wider.  Because here we are talking about a judicial (unintelligible).  We are not talking about court judgements which were passed in a context different from the one which is of interest to us.  That witness was charged in Rwanda with crimes which fall under the jurisdiction of your Tribunal.  That is why we are interested in those decisions, Mr. President.  So for the Defence work, that judgement is not indispensable.  That is our view.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And now you referred to the judgement of Witness ALG.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes -- well, in the procedure of the Rwandan law, which your Tribunal knows very well, it is not really a court judgement.  In those proceedings the Accused, once he is a suspect, can make confessions to the Prosecutor.  And from what we understand, that witness made a confession.  But the confessions were rejected. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, I understand that.  I used the word "judgement" wrongly.  But what you meant was the -- a rejection of the confession.  But it's the ALG confession which was the -- or the rejection of it -- which was the document you referred to most recently in your intervention.  It's just a matter of ensuring communication. 

So does this mean, then, that the Bench doesn't have to do anything now in order to ensure translation?  For the time being, things are under control?  That's how I interpret your intervention.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President.  It is not a problem of translation.  The problem is the absence of that document in the judicial file which we received.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So did we now hear you?  And we may be able to sort this out now immediately.  Is, then, the problem that in the comprehensive file of Witness ALG, there is one document lacking in which you are interested?  And that document is the document in which the Prosecution rejected the confession of the witness?  Is that the problem?  A missing document?  
MR. CANTIER: 
That is indeed the case, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Prosecution, do you have any comment on this now, or later, as to the availability or existence of this document?  
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, I'm not aware of the existence of this document.  However, my learned friend may well be right that such a document does exist somewhere.  It is not in the possession of the Prosecutor.  Every relevant document has been disclosed.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  That brings us to the end of this administrative section, and we can then have our lunch break.  And we will adjourn to 2:30.  

Is there anything else to be raised?  
MR. CANTIER: 
I'm sorry, Mr. President.  Just to clear this matter once and for all.  We also have the judgement regarding Witness BUO, which we perused with the assistance of our investigator, and which for us is necessary.  The problem is that that judgement is 186 pages long.  

Now, I need to know when that witness is scheduled.  And with the modifications in the scheduling sequence, I don't really know exactly what is going to happen.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could you discuss this, Prosecution, and come back to us later today about the suggested appearance of that witness?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Absolutely, Your Honour.  And just, finally, you asked for page numbers.  Page references.  UL statements appear at pages 040, so that should be in volume 1.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Pages 040?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
0 to 40.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
240?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
I'm sorry, Your Honour.  I'm absent my case manager.  And because of having to give our files to the interpreters, I don't think we necessarily have the same set that Your Honour has.  But the pagination I've got is -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Slowly. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
-- it is page 0 to 40.  If that is not correct in Your Honour's bundles, then I'm very sorry.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  Thank you.  The Court is adjourned.  
(Court recessed at 1303H)
(Pages 32 to 46 by Vicki Eastvold)

(Court resumed at 1436H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You will be referred to as Witness UL in these proceedings.  You have to tell the truth, and the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
(Declaration made by Witness UL in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have a document in front of you there, Mr. Witness, with your signature.  Isn't that so?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the information contained in that document is correct, isn't it?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Mussa. 
MR. MUSSA:
Your Honours, the next Exhibit is P. 65. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal.
 (Exhibit No. P. 65 admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Prosecution, open or closed?  
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, this is a matter that has just been brought to my attention -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
A bit more slowly. 
MS. MELLUISH:
I'm sorry. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MS. MELLUISH:
That this witness has requested that his entire testimony be given in closed session because he is of the opinion -- he is of the opinion that what he was doing after 6th of April was something that very few people were doing and that to talk about it at all will reveal his identity.  

Your Honour will probably have noted that UL has given evidence before this Tribunal once before, and on that occasion was granted his request that his entire testimony be held in camera.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You said that the summary of this witness was to be found from page 0 to page 40.  Wasn't that so? 
MS. MELLUISH:
That's what I said, yes, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We note the occupation of the personal information sheet.  What is the most relevant summary so that we have an idea as to what he's going to testify to?  
MS. MELLUISH:
Perhaps it would be simplest to look at the amended annex to the pre-trial brief, if Your Honour has it to hand.  

And the relevant part is at page 6 of that -- or, on the sixth page of that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we have noted your request concerning closed session.  And we do not want you to go into detail because we are now in open session, but let me just inform you that, as you know, having testified before at this Tribunal, the main rule is to testify in open sessions.  And the Tribunal has developed techniques in order to achieve openness and transparency, to the extent possible, but at the same time protecting the witnesses against revealing their identity.  One way could be to hear your testimony partially in closed session, or only a limited part in open, to put it that way.  

Having looked at your summary now, is it your view that it cannot be the solution to proceed, to some extent, in open before we go into closed?  Could I have your comment, please?  But don't reveal your profession or identity in your answer, please.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  As you must be aware, there is a problem of security for witnesses in Rwanda.  Witnesses have been killed in the country, and others have been persecuted.  These witnesses were those who had testified against ordinary citizens, but I am here to testify against someone who was at the helm of Kigali préfecture.  If my identity were to be disclosed, I cannot be certain that my security will be ensured subsequently.  

You have asked me to proceed in open session and then in closed session.  My reaction is that it is possible that there are some details, some truths, which I cannot omit, and I fear that speaking about such issues could disclose my identity.  I, therefore, am not certain that I will enjoy 100 per cent protection today and in the future.  

Day -- the day before yesterday, I heard on the news that a witness had barely escaped by the skin of his teeth, had escaped death.  He was almost killed.  So my preference would be to testify in closed session.  But if you feel that I should testify in open session, well, I believe that the first -- the best thing to do would be to start in closed session, and if you find out that there is no problem, then you can publish my testimony or you can invite me to return and testify in open session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any comment by the Defence?  
MR. CANTIER:
We uphold the principle of public hearings in much the same way as the Tribunal, but the Defence understands the concerns of the witness, even as I said yesterday.  So it would be out of place for me to say anything contrary now.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
In order to be on the safe side, we will start in closed, follow the testimony closely, and see whether portions of it at a later stage may take place in open session.  But your -- the request is granted for at least the beginning of the testimony.  

So we have to ask those in the public gallery kindly to leave us. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 50 to 76] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
