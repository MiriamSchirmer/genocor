MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning.  The Court is in session.  

Good morning, Madam Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Your examination continues in open session. 
WITNESS ATQ
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Madam Witness, do you remember that when we finished yesterday, you had just described what happened at Sainte Famille on, you thought, about the 16th of June 1994.  Do you remember that? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Now, you said that after Renzaho came the second time, he beckoned -- or it's unclear, actually, whether it was Renzaho or the lieutenant in terms of the -- in charge of the gendarmes.  But you said that he beckoned one of the Interahamwe.  Can you recall who it was who beckoned to the Interahamwe?  Was it Renzaho or the lieutenant, or somebody else altogether? 
A.	I explained to you that it was Renzaho who beckoned to the Interahamwe. 
Q.	You also said that, then, the Interahamwe called Cimba came back and said, "Musee has just ordered us to stop".  If you have a view on this, can you tell the Court, please, who you believed he meant by "Musee"? 
A.	Usually in Kinyarwanda when you use that word, it is out of politeness and deference.  And when I heard it, I realized that of the people present the most respectable was Renzaho.  Now, if you ask me, I will tell you my understanding was that the Interahamwe was referring to Renzaho.  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you very much.  I have no more questions for you, Madam Witness, but the Defence may have.  
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Madam Witness, may I ask you, during your testimony you mentioned names of two ladies, Odette and Angeline.  Did you know those ladies before the events in Rwanda?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I knew them because Angeline had been the head teacher of the school complex where I attended second -- primary school.  Subsequently, she was promoted to the post of school inspector for Nyarugenge commune.  But above all, she was **************.  Concerning Odette Nyirabagenzi, she was a conseiller de secteur, and I knew her because her home was close to the school complex where I attended primary school.  And, in fact, her children were schoolmates of mine. 
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Thank you.  And do you know what happened to these ladies after the events?  
THE WITNESS:
I do not know what happened to any of them.  I simply know they went into exile.  Just as the other genocidaires did.  But I have no information regarding their present situation. 
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Thank you very much.  
THE WITNESS:
Welcome.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
I am obliged, Mr. President.  Good morning, Witness.  Good morning, Counsel.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, let us delve into the events at CELA immediately, and let us start by talking about the soldiers who accompanied Mr. Renzaho when he arrived there.  And in that connection, my question is to know whether at the time you could make a difference between soldiers and gendarmes.  Are you able to tell us whether those accompanying Mr. Renzaho were soldiers, or gendarmes?  
A.	Yes.  I can make a distinction between gendarmes and soldiers.  Soldiers had blue or green berets, whereas gendarmes had red berets.  I think that the people accompanying Renzaho were gendarmes. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  On that 22nd of April 1994, was that the first time you had seen gendarmes within the CELA compound, or were there some gendarmes already ensuring the security of CELA before Mr. Renzaho arrived there? 
A.	There were no gendarmes ensuring security in that centre.  It was the first time I was seeing gendarmes at that centre.  And even though it was the first time I dared looking at the road, I said to myself that if they had been gendarmes before that date I would have learned of it.  
Q.	Thank you, Madam.  Would you also remember how Renzaho was dressed when you saw him arrive? 
A.	I don't remember how he was dressed. 
Q.	To make it simple, Witness, since you said that when he came to the Sainte Famille he was in a military attire; when he came to CELA was he in military or in civilian clothing? 
A.	I told you I no longer remember the type of clothing he had on.  If I was able to state the type of clothing he had when he came to the Sainte Famille, it is because I was able to remember.  But I cannot remember how he was dressed when he came to the CELA centre.  
Q.	Thank you, ma'am.  Now, when you said that in front of Mr. Renzaho and Bourgmestre Jean Bizimana was Mr. Renzaho's vehicle, can you tell the Court whether that vehicle was parked within or without the CELA compound? 
A.	I think you misconstrued me.  I did not say there was a vehicle parked in front of Mr. Renzaho.  I said when we went outside, we saw one ordinary vehicle and another armoured vehicle.  
Q.	Apart from those two vehicles, you didn't see any other vehicles on this day?  Can you be more specific? 
A.	On that day there were many vehicles inside the centre, because the missionaries, when leaving, did not go with their vehicles, so they had left many vehicles parked inside the compound, inside the centre.  The other vehicle I talked about to you was parked outside, and one could know that the vehicle had been used.  It is possible that there were other vehicles that had recently been used, but when I made that observation I noticed that it was that particular vehicle which had been used recently.  Let me state, however, that inside the compound were other vehicles which had been parked and which had not been used.  
Q.	I thank you.  Witness, you said that Mr. Renzaho arrived in the company of Bourgmestre Jean Bizimana.  Do you remember what the bourgmestre was doing when Mr. Renzaho was discussing with the Interahamwe when they arrived there? 
A.	When they got there, they did not really part ways.  They were in the same group.  
Q.	Very well, ma'am.  You also said that after discussing with that group of attackers, Mr. Renzaho spoke to Mr. Vincent Mugiraneza.  Are you certain that he did not also speak to you, the other refugees in general? 
A.	I told you that he ordered us to return to our homes, that our security would be ensured in our very homes.  
Q.	Witness, I don't think my question was clear enough.  Before he ordered you to return to your homes, and at the time when he was talking to Mr. Vincent Mugiraneza, did he not speak to other refugees before he gave you the orders subsequently? 
A.	I don't know how to explain this to you.  I had already described to you the place where we were.  As I said, our group was separated from the other refugees.  There was some distance between us.  You see, our group was on the higher ground in the garage.  And in that group, Renzaho spoke only to Vincent.  And what he said was what I'd already told you, that is, that he ordered us to return to our homes. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Talking about groups, now.  How were the groups organised?  Did you just gather randomly, or did you line up when the Interahamwe asked you to separate yourselves? 
A.	Which group are you referring to, Counsel?  Can you be more specific?  
Q.	Let's take your group, for instance, Witness.  Did you line up, or were you sort of grouped in a random manner?  That is the only way I can explain it.  
A.	At the place where we were, we were not lined up or queued up.  I thought I explained this to you yesterday.  I told you I don't even remember how we went right up to the garage.  I mean, I and the other people who were with me, about ten of them.  But when we went up to the garage, there were other young men who were being picked up from the various parts of the centre and placed in front of a veranda in one of the CELA buildings.  But at the place where we were in the garage, we were not lined up.  Let me state further that the place we were was slightly higher than the other parts of that centre, and that made it possible for us to look down at the other people in the centre.  And that is how we were able to notice when the Interahamwe brought one Albert.  The various people who were brought in there were placed below the place where we were, and lined up in front of a long veranda of the building below the garage. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Witness, you have on a few occasions now mentioned that you testified about these matters yesterday.  With other words, you seem to be under the impression that there is some repetition involved here.  Now, the system in the courtroom is that first the Prosecution will ask questions, and then the Defence will ask questions about roughly the same matters as the Prosecution went through.  And the purpose is to obtain clarity and further precision, and this will inevitably imply some repetition.  So that's the system, and the purpose is to establish the truth.  So you do not have to remind us that you told us this yesterday.  We all remember very well your evidence.  It's a matter of further precision.  

Here follows the next question. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, concerning Mr. Vincent Mugiraneza, you said that after Mr. Renzaho called him an Inyenzi, Fidèle took him away.  Can we come back to this for you to tell us where Fidèle took him to? 
A.	When Fidèle took Vincent from our group, he went down with him to the veranda where the other people were.  But subsequently when the people to be killed were brought -- and I should state that this is information I got from the people who were at the Sainte Famille church -- Vincent was not taken away with those people, the group who were to be killed.  Vincent was taken out of that group of people to be killed.  He was taken out of that group, actually, by Renzaho.  And when I arrived at the Sainte Famille church, I met one of his children who had survived, but who had been hit by a bullet on his leg.  He told me that he hoped -- he had hopes that his father was still alive because he had been told that someone had protected him and had assisted him in fleeing, as it were.
Q.	The further information you got concerning Vincent was something you subsequently got to know?  I mean, you did not witness Renzaho taking him away, am I correct? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel, because Fidèle went down with him to the garage and placed him together with the others who were below in front of the veranda.  That is what I was able to observe. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I have one last question for you regarding CELA.  Are you certain that when Mr. Renzaho spoke to you, he requested you to go to your respective homes, rather than to the Saint Paul centre and the Sainte Famille church? 
A.	I am sure of what I'm telling you.  That is the truth. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Let us now move to the Sainte Famille parish where you found yourself several weeks.  You said you saw Mr. Renzaho at the Sainte Famille on two occasions, correct? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	Are you sure you did not see him a third or a fourth time? 
A.	I saw Renzaho twice on the same day.  But before, I had seen him pass by the church when he was going to the Saint Paul centre, and was accompanied by other people.  
Q.	When you say you saw him twice on the same day, Witness, can you be more specific and give us a time of day when you saw him that same day?  
A.	The first time was around 10 o'clock, between 9 and 10 o'clock, and it was on the 16th.  Actually, it was on the 16th that I saw him twice.  Then I saw him again perhaps around 12 o'clock or 1 o'clock.  
Q.	Witness, with the leave of the Chamber, I'm going to read certain portions of your statement of 9th of January 2000, when it was signed, and relating to the dates when you claim you saw Mr. Renzaho.
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, it is the witness's statement signed on the 9th of December 2000, with a K reference K0153332 for the French.  I'm actually on page three, with the K reference, K0153334, on the subsequent page.  All that concerns the French version.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You are referring to the 9th of December because that is the signature of the witness, whereas the date of the interview is the 31st of August 2000.  Is that so?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
That's right, Mr. President.  31st of August. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	So, Witness, let me read certain passages to you.  "I saw Odette Nyirabagenzi, the conseiller, Tharcisse Renzaho, and militiamen come to the Sainte Famille church.  They conferred briefly with Father Munyeshyaka and moved together to Saint Paul's where there were other refugees.  The day after their visit to Saint Paul's, some refugees were killed".  

And I will move to the fourth paragraph so as not to be on this very long.  This is what you continue:  "The day following the evacuation, that is, the RPF evacuation, Renzaho came along with several militiamen, to the Sainte Famille church where he visited all the refugees, and they left".  

Now, Witness, let me skip a few passages.  I'll move to the seventh line where you say, "The militiamen told us to thank them".  And you're referring to the day when Renzaho came the second time.  "The militiamen told us to thank them, and then they departed, sparing our lives.  The day after the massacres the UNAMIR soldiers arrived, but Father Munyeshyaka adamantly refused to let them enter the church.  Around 6 p.m. on the same day, Renzaho arrived in the company of Father Munyeshyaka". 
Witness, let me stop the reading at this level and ask you whether, from your statement, it doesn't come out that you saw Renzaho at Sainte Famille three times and over three different days.  Is that not what one can understand when reading your statement? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  In my statement it is said that Renzaho came to the Sainte Famille church, as you just read, and he was accompanied by Odette and other people, including Munyakaze, and they went toward the Saint Paul pastoral centre.  And a few days later, there was an RPF raid, and RPF troops evacuated certain refugees.  And the day following that operation, Renzaho came to the Sainte Famille church.  He arrived there in the company of the priest.  Actually, they did not get there together, but when we saw them they were together, and they left some moments later on.  I don't know whether the passage you read, the Interahamwe asked us to thank them because they had stopped the killings, I don't know whether it was not mentioned that it was the order they had just received.  And the following day, UNAMIR continued its operation to evacuate people who wanted to go to RPF-controlled territory, and others who wanted to go to government-controlled territory.  When UNAMIR troops arrived there, the priest refused to let them in because there were many bodies in that compound.  Thereafter, the bodies were lined up in the place and covered with sheets.  And as you actually said, Counsel, I did not remember that detail.  And I believe you can understand that, because those things happened a long time ago.  In fact, I don't think we would want to reminisce about all those gory incidents.  

The following day, as the priest had forbidden UNAMIR troops from entering the site, there were some military commanders who came there.  Renzaho did not come alone, he came with other soldiers who passed for officers, because I did not know them.  And Renzaho was in a gendarmerie uniform.  When they left, the bodies were removed.  There were some young men responsible for that duty, and as a reward they were given milk.  Those young men removed the bodies and placed them at the procure.  I don't know where the bodies were subsequently placed, but I know that on that occasion they were moved to the procure. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So around the 16th of June, how many times did you then see Mr. Renzaho, in total?  Just answer now with a number, please.  
THE WITNESS:
I saw him four times.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you saw him four times over how many days?  Again, just a figure, please. 
THE WITNESS:
Three different dates, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the first occasion was at 10 o'clock, as you described, true?  On the 16th.  

THE WITNESS:
No, not true.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Then explain when the first occasion was.  You see, this is the purpose; to make sure that we really understand your evidence.  What was the time when you first saw him on the 16th?  
THE WITNESS:
The first time I saw Renzaho while I was at the Sainte Famille church, Renzaho was passing by that place.  He was accompanied by other people.  They were on their way to the Saint Paul centre.  On the 16th, I saw Renzaho again twice.  And on another date, which may have been the 17th or the 18th, I saw Renzaho in the evening.  Those were the different times when I saw Renzaho. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, what was the date when you saw him passing by on his way to Saint Paul, approximately?  
THE WITNESS:
I no longer remember the date.  You see, we remember those dates depending on the events we were experiencing.  You can have -- if you can have a witness who was at the Saint Paul centre, he may be more specific to you regarding the date in reference to the events following Mr. Renzaho's visit. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And we understand that fully, and that's why I used the word "approximately".  

Now, would you say that you first saw him on his way to Saint Paul a day before the 16th, a couple of days before the 16th, or more?  Just give us an indication so that we understand your testimony, and then we will move on.  
THE WITNESS:
It is very difficult for me even to give you an approximate date.  But in any case, it was not only two days before the 16th.  All I remember is that he was on his way to the Saint Paul centre.  But the RPF raid on the Saint Paul centre perhaps took place one week after the killings which had taken place at that centre.  So you may use that as a benchmark to give a timeframe when Mr. Renzaho visited that place. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This sighting of Mr. Renzaho, shall we say that it happened in June?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that's what I think, though I'm not certain. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And then we move onto the 16th, and that's where you had two observations, one at 10 o'clock and one at 12 o'clock.  Is this correctly understood?  
THE WITNESS:
I've always said "around 10 o'clock" and "around 12 o'clock" so those are just approximate times. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Very good.  We understand that.  And then the last occasion, when would you place that in time, the fourth time?  
THE WITNESS:
It was perhaps on the 18th in the evening around 6 p.m. or 4 p.m. -- or, rather, between 5 and 6 p.m.  I remember that because UNAMIR troops came and evacuated people, but they could not gain access.  We could see trucks outside.  The following day, Renzaho came there and bodies were removed.  Now, if I remember that, the operation took place on the 16th, that means that Renzaho visited that place around the 18th.  But once again, that's an approximate date. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's fine.  Thank you, Madam Witness.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, just two last questions for you.  Are you certain that on the 17th of June 1994 Major -- or Colonel Laurent Munyakaze did not evacuate refugees from the Saint Paul and Sainte Famille after the RPF raid?  
A.	And where would he have evacuated them to, Counsel?  
Q.	To the Mille Collines hotel and the Kigali archdiocese.  
A.	Counsel, I don't know whether I should explain this to you, because that is information I came to know about subsequently.  But it was an operation which concerned the elderly persons who were still at the Saint Paul, and other people who were scared and who did not understand that it was an Inkotanyi-led raid.  And subsequently, Father Celestin and the other people were evacuated and moved to the Saint Michel church.  That is the only operation I know of which was conducted after the RPF raid.  About the people Munyakaze may have moved to the Mille Collines hotel, when we arrived at the Sainte Famille church those people had already been evacuated, and I know not of anyone who was reportedly evacuated to the Mille Collines hotel from the Sainte Famille church on the 17th of June. 
Q.	Last question, Witness.  When you saw Mr. Renzaho on the 16th, didn't you see beside him an officer of UNAMIR who was allegedly with him on that day in order to organise the transfer of refugees?  You do not recall such a visit by Mr. Renzaho and an officer of UNAMIR?  
A.	No. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Witness.  Mr. President, Your Honours, this marks the end of the cross-examination by the Defence.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Any exhibits to be tendered?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, indeed, Mr. President.  The statement I made use of, and which bears the signature of the witness, and is dated 9th of December 2000, the date of the interview being the 31st of August 2000. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The French version is the signed version, will be A, the English version B.  Mr. Matemanga, the number?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
D.  24. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And under seal.  
(Exhibit No. D. 24A and D. 24B admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any re-examination?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
No, Your Honour. 
JUDGE ARREY: 
Witness, you were born in 1976, is that correct?  So in 1984 at the time of the genocide you were just 8 years old.  
THE WITNESS:
Did I understand you correctly, Your Honour?  Which year are you referring to?  
JUDGE ARREY: 
Were you born in '76?
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
JUDGE ARREY: 
So in '84, how old were you?  
THE WITNESS:
You're mistaken, Madam.  I was -- it was 1994. 
JUDGE ARREY: 
Yes.  What I wanted to ask is did you own a wristwatch at that time?  You had a watch?  You did?  
THE WITNESS:
No.  I did not have a watch.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So we agree that you were approximately 18 in '94, isn't that so?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You see, we have to place that on record because yesterday there was a slight mistake in the transcripts when it came to your age in '94, and now we have corrected that.  

Mr. Vincent Mugiraneza, had you ever seen him before the 22nd of April?  
THE WITNESS:
I saw him when he came to seek refuge at CELA.  I do not know whether you wish me to provide any further details on the matter.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I just need to know whether you knew Vincent Mugiraneza before you saw him at CELA. 
THE WITNESS:
I knew him.  ***************************. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That was the end of your testimony, Madam.  We would like to thank you for having come the long way to Arusha to testify, and wish you a very safe journey home.  Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you very much. 
THE WITNESS:
I also thank you, Mr. President.  
(Witness excused) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
HAD's declaration is in which folder?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Volume 3, Your Honour, beginning at page 186D. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, Madam Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You will be referred to as Witness HAD in these proceedings.  You have to tell the truth, and the registry will now take your solemn declaration.  
(Declaration made by Witness HAD in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You have a document in front of you with your signature, isn't that so?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
There is a correction there; but taking into account that handwritten note, I understand that the information contained in this document is correct, is that so?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Matemanga?

MR. PRESIDENT:
	Prosecution?
WITNESS HAD,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Madam Witness, in March 1994, where were you living? 
A.	I was living in ************* in the Rugenge secteur. 
Q.	And who were you living with, if anyone?  
A.	I was living with my paternal aunt, as well as her family. 
Q.	Did you have an occupation at that time? 
A.	I was a pupil at the Rugunga secondary school.  I was in second year. 
Q.	Now, after the 6th of April, did you remain at home with your family? 
A.	After the 6th there was insecurity in our neighbourhood following Habyarimana's death, so we decided to leave that neighbourhood because we had been -- we had come under attack the previous night.  And so I left, along with those members of my family.  (By order of the Court, this portion of the evidence was extracted and kept under separate cover) 
Q.	Are you able to give a more precise date as to when you left home? 
A.	I do not know with certainty, but I believe it was between the 8th and the 10th.  It was during that period that we left our home. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This last sentence in the previous answer, does that raise a protection issue?  It's difficult to understand what is actually meant by it.  

MS. MELLUISH: 
I wouldn't pursue that -- investigation of the meaning of it without going into closed session, so perhaps it could be extracted. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Let's do that.  So we will place under seal the sentence starting at 9:43:42, "And it was".  That will be placed under separate cover.  

Video booth, please do not transmit that.  

Madam Witness, please ensure that you do not give information which directly or indirectly may reveal your identity.  We are not certain that this would, but to be on the safe side. 

Next question, please?  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Can you tell us, please, where you went when you left home? 
A.	We went to the CELA centre, which was managed by White Fathers, and we remained there until the 22nd of April.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And, Mr. President, a correction from the interpreter's booth.  The witness was a student, and was in her fifth year.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much to the interpreters.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Can you tell us why you left on the 22nd of April? 
A.	On the 22nd, we were attacked by Interahamwe at that location where we had sought refuge.  They came with Préfet Renzaho, as well as other officials of the Rugenge secteur, such as the conseiller de secteur and the school inspector.  They came with Interahamwe, as well as some of our neighbours.  They abducted a number of people from CELA and they took them away to kill them.  And on that day, the préfet ordered us to leave the centre and go back home.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, I'd like you, please, to tell us about the events on the 22nd of April in a little more detail.  Can we begin with the first moment that you became aware that the centre was under attack?  Can you tell us what you were doing at that time? 
A.	I was in one of the rooms where we had sought refuge, and we heard people shout and say that the Interahamwe had just launched an attack.  In fact, we were expecting it, because a few days before there was what was called community work carried out around the centre, and there were even people who had infiltrated the centre claiming that they were refugees, but we thought that they had come to assess of number of refugees who were at the centre.  So we saw the attack coming.  But prior to that, there was also a priest of the Sainte Famille church who would come to the centre quite often in order to see who was there.  So this did not come as a surprise.  We heard shouts, we heard whistling.  There was a lot of noise, and we understood that we were under attack.  Some of the attackers came in beating people.  They took us out of the rooms and brought us before the préfet.  And they told us that a meeting was going to be held, and so we went to listen to what the préfet had to tell us.  And some people were saying that since the préfet had just arrived, we would be saved, whereas others thought it was a bad omen.  And one of the people who had gone to school with him told us that we would not have any problem. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Witness, we have to proceed more slowly.  You have answered the question posed by the Prosecution.  Now follows the next question. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Can you describe briefly whereabouts in CELA it was that you were brought before the préfet? 
A.	It was next to the garage, not far from the entrance of CELA; the entrance which is on the asphalt road, the tarmac road. 
Q.	Can you give us the name of the préfet? 
A.	Tharcisse Renzaho. 
Q.	Was that the first time that you had seen Tharcisse Renzaho, or had you seen him before the 22nd of April 1994? 
A.	I had seen him before on television, but I had never seen him face to face. 
Q.	So when you first saw him on the 22nd of April, did you recognise him yourself? 
A.	I did not recognise him immediately because I was not close to where he was.  But when I went near him, I recognised him.  And even those who were with me, as well as the Interahamwe, would tell us that it was him.  And the Interahamwe told us to go and listen to what the préfet had to tell us, and to go and attend the meeting held by the préfet. 
Q.	When you first saw him on 22nd of April, who was he with, if anyone? 
A.	He was with many Interahamwe.  There were a lot of people around him.  I saw Interahamwe who were wearing strange clothing, and I also saw gendarmes in the group, as well as the conseiller of Rugenge, Odette Nyirabagenzi, as well as Angeline and other people such as Gisagara; Fidèle, Castar; Kivide.  There were many people from our neighbourhood.  There were very many of them. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We need two names.  Gisagara; can you help us with the spelling there, Madam?  
THE WITNESS:
G-I-S-A-G-A-R-A. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And then there was another name after Fidèle.  Can the booth help us with the spelling there?  

THE WITNESS:
One Nkeshimana, whose nickname was Kivide.  Kivide is spelled K-I-V-I-D-E.  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Nkeshimana is 183. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

And just for clarity, Madam Witness, what time was it when you saw Mr. Renzaho for the first time on the 22nd?  What time of the day?  
THE WITNESS:
I do not know exactly what time it was, but it was before noon. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Now, when you saw the préfet, can you tell us what, if anything, he did?  
A.	I was not as close as the others.  But when I got there, he was saying that people had to be sorted out.  That women and children had to be put on one side, and young men on the other side.  And he was saying that the women and the children should go home, and that their safety would be ensured in their homes.  We told him that we could not go back to our homes because our homes had been destroyed, and he did not say anything to that.  I should also add that none of those who went back home survived.  
Q.	Firstly, Madam Witness, to whom was he saying that the people had to be sorted out?  
A.	He was telling the Interahamwe that they had to sort people out and put men and -- to put women and children in a different group from that of the men. 
Q.	You said, "We told him that we could not go back to our homes".  Who do you mean by "we"? 
A.	I'm referring to the refugees who were there, especially the women and the children.  Because we realised that the men were going to be killed.  
Q.	Did the préfet say anything else beside what you have told the Court? 
A.	As far as I know he did not say anything else.  They selected the refugees and took away a group of people, and I left.  I wanted to go back home since that was what we had been told to do, but at that point the gendarme told us to go to Sainte Famille because we might be killed if we went back to our homes. 
Q.	When people were being selected as you described, was the préfet still there, do you know? 
A.	The préfet was there. 
Q.	And while that was happening, what, if anything, was he doing? 
A.	He was standing there and he was talking to the people who had accompanied him.  I was under the impression that he had other obligations, and that he would go elsewhere after having left the CELA centre.  
Q.	What type of people were selected? 
A.	Young Tutsi men. 
Q.	And do you recall how many were selected? 
A.	There were many of them.  I cannot give you the exact number.  I did not even want to see what was happening.  I did not want to meet any of the attackers' eyes so that they would not put me in the group of those who would be killed.  What I do know that is there were more than 40 -- 30 young men. 
Q.	Do you know how the selection took place? 
A.	I don't quite understand your question. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Witness, we have two versions now.  Can you repeat your answer?  You said that -- it's difficult to assess the number.  But "What I do know is that there were more than" -- and then you gave an estimate.  Can you just repeat that estimate?  
THE WITNESS:
Forty.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	My question about the selection, Madam Witness, was whether you know on what basis those approximately 40 Tutsi young men were picked from amongst the refugees? 
A.	They had a list, and one of Interahamwe was reading out the names on the list.  But I should also say that the attackers were our neighbours.  They were friends of our families.  They even knew some -- they even knew some of the people very well.  So they would read out the names on the list, but they would also choose the people they knew from -- in the neighbourhood.  
Q.	Did you know any of those who were taken away?  Selected to be taken away? 
A.	I told you that they left with Rwanga, his family, as well as his two sons, Wilson and Déglote.  They also left with a neighbour, Charles Gahima, and his eldest son, whose name I no longer remember.  They went away with plenty of people, namely, one Rwigamba, Christophe Safari, and other young people of that neighbourhood.  We really did not want to watch that scene unfold because we did not know we would survive to one day tell the story of what happened. 
Q.	Thank you.  We just need to deal with some spellings before we move on.  The Rwanga names appear at 242, 243 and 245 of the list.  Charles Gahima was spelled yesterday as G-A-H-I-M-A.  Christophe Safari, I think, speaks for itself.  But, Madam Witness, can you help with the other name you gave?  I think it was "Rusegamba" (phonetic), is that correct?  
A.	I said Rwigamba, spelled R-W-I-G-A-M-B-A.  
Q.	Thank you.  Do you know why Charles Rwanga and his family were targeted? 
A.	Charles Rwanga had been a long time resident of Kiyovu neighbourhood.  And as I explained to you, people were slaughtered by people who knew them very well.  So Rwanga had gone to hide at the CELA centre.  But when his wife realised that the children had been abducted, she went to plead with Préfet Renzaho because she knew him, and she said the children were young and they were not involved in politics.  And she said if they wanted to abduct people, then they should take away the adults.  The préfet answered her that if they had been able to get Rwanga, then they would have spared the children.  That is how the lady went to get Charles Rwanga.  But, unfortunately, he was taken away, along with the children. 
Q.	Did you hear that conversation between Charles Rwanga's name and Renzaho yourself, or did somebody tell you about it?  
A.	I personally heard that conversation.  Because as I told you, *************************************************.  So when that conversation took place, I was there.  Because those who were close to that lady at that time were just me and her young daughter. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And when did that conversation take place?  
THE WITNESS:
It took place while the attackers were selecting the refugees, asking ladies and children to return home.  That is how that lady started pleading for her children to be spared. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Were you still at CELA when those 40-odd people were taken away? 
A.	After the selection had been done and we had been ordered to return home, and when the gendarme warned us against it and told us not to go to our homes, I pretended to return home but I really did not go home.  Rather, I went down to a small room which was the infirmary.  That is where he was holed up.  
Q.	So does it follow from what you just said that you didn't -- you weren't present when the people were taken away?  Or have I misunderstood what you've said? 
A.	When those 40 people went out of the compound, I did not see them because I went and holed up in that small room I told you about.  But I saw other people who had been asked to kneel down in the garden.  Those are the people I could see because they were just in front of me.  Subsequently, they were led away.  However, the 40 other people were located at the place I could no longer see.  But when they were subsequently led away, I heard gunshots, and later on the Interahamwe came and looted CELA.  They had a list from which they read out the names of the people they had not yet laid hands on and whom they were still looking out for.  
Q.	Did you see that list yourself, or did you just hear about it?  
A.	The people who had the list were just close to me, because I was hiding in that room.  And since there was a screen between us, I could see them.  They were talking, saying that Rwanga and his children were dead, so their names should be crossed out.  And they continued saying, for instance, "This person has escaped, he jumped out of the car, we need to wait for him here".  And they said "This other one has left".  They also said that Vincent had left with Renzaho.  So I was able to follow that conversation, and I could see them crossing out the names of people who had been killed and they were saying they would identify the people who had not yet been found and who needed to be tracked down.  
Q.	And was this on the same day, the 22nd of April, or another day? 
A.	It was on the same day, April 22, because everyone had left the centre and I was almost alone there.  But I should further state that I also left that centre in the evening and went to the Sainte Famille church. 
Q.	Can you recall approximately what time of day it was that you heard the Interahamwe talking about the list and the people that had been killed and so on? 
A.	During such trying moments, it's difficult to know exact times.  But I would say it was about two hours since the rumpus had stopped, so it was at that time that I heard the Interahamwe returning to the centre.  By that time even the gunshots had ceased.  There was no noise.  
Q.	You told us earlier that a gendarme had warned you not to go home, and that was why you didn't.  Can you explain to the Court the circumstances in which he said that? 
A.	You know, those committing the killings were the ones who could spare your life.  Some of those people actually did not have the intent to kill.  It was very easy for them to reach us at the places where we were grouped up.  I think he had been ordered to warn us so that we would, rather, fall into a trap laid by the attackers.  
(Pages 1 to 17 by Vicki Eastvold)




















1015H
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	What trap do you mean, what kind of trap are you talking about? 
A.	It was for the refugees to gather at one place; that would have eased the massacre.  Instead of having to go and look for each and every refugee here and there in the various places where there were hiding.  So it was much easier to gather them all at the same place. 
Q.	So, you -- you said earlier that had -- that all the people that went home were killed.  Are you now saying that, in fact, it would have been better for you to have gone home? 
A.	That would not have served any purpose because we did not have any other place to go and seek refuge, actually --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the French interpreter did not get the first part of counsel's last question.  If that could be repeated, thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you simply repeat your question?  
MS. MELLUISH:
I'm trying to remember what it was, Your Honour -- on the basis -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, we have it (French spoken) 
MS. MELLUISH:
Oh, I see, yes, I -- I don't have it in French in front of me.  

My question was that you said earlier, that all the people who went home were killed.  Are you now saying, in fact, it would have been better for you to have gone home?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	You mentioned, Madam Witness, somebody called "Vincent" whom you heard -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you moving slightly to Vincent now?  
MS. MELLUISH:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you move on -- Madam Witness, you saw Renzaho arrive before noon on the 22nd of April; that's what you explained, isn't that so?  
THE WITNESS:
That's right, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Approximately when were the 40 persons led away?
THE WITNESS:
I no longer remember if that operation lasted for a period of hours.  But, you see, when you're undergoing such trying moments, it's as if it's taking forever. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It was in the afternoon or the evening? 
THE WITNESS:
I think it was still before noon -- or around noon, because the attackers did not stay long at the centre.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, now, you also mentioned a group that was kneeling -- persons were kneeling, do you remember that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I do.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's a different group, isn't it? 
THE WITNESS:
That second group was a group of people who had been asked to kneel down in the garden.  But subsequently, they were also put into the car.  I gave the figure of 40, it's not because I counted them when they were standing there.  But subsequently, when we gathered our wits together, each and every one gave the names of those who were with them before, and who had been taken away.  That is how we were able to reconstitute what had happened and to arrive at that figure. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But just for communication purposes now, there was one group of 40 young men, and one group, which I have referred to as "kneeling people".  Is that correctly understood?  
THE WITNESS:
Amongst the people kneeling in the garden, were also young men and young women.  So the young men added to that first group to take that figure to 40.  But, mind you, that figure is just an approximation because I didn't count them. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's fine, Madam, I'm trying to find out whether there were two departures:  One departure of the 
40 young men and one other departure of those who had been kneeling.  Can you just explain that? 
THE WITNESS:
No, there were not two departures.  Before being taken away, the groups of -- the two groups were taken and in that group of people kneeling in the garden, were young men and young women.  So, the young men from the kneeling group were taken to add to the group which was located above.  And when they had that consolidated group of 40 people, they were all taken away at once. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, madam. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	You mentioned someone called "Vincent" and you said that you heard Interahamwe say -- I think it was Interahamwe - say, he'd been taken away by Renzaho.  Who was that Vincent, do you know? 
A.	Yes, I knew that Vincent.  Vincent was a head of a family; he had children who were of my age.  I knew him like someone who lived with us in the same neighbourhood.  He had been a minister in the transition government and his wife also worked at Electrogaz; that is how I knew Vincent.  
Q.	Do you know his second name? 
A.	I think he was called Mugiraneza -- I am not sure, but I think he was Mugiraneza.  But whenever I had to talk -- to talk to him, I called him Papa Vicki; that is why it's difficult for me to remember that surname because I didn't often use it. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, did you ever find out what happened to those 40-odd people who were taken away from CELA? 
A.	What I heard from the Interahamwe was that those people had been gunned down along the road.  In fact, the Interahamwe said some of them had been gunned down and others had escaped.  Furthermore, I knew that when we exhumed the bodies, which had been buried in the mass graves, we identified the bodies of some of those who were of that group.  
Q.	And do you recall what mass graves those bodies were exhumed from? 
A.	The most renown grave was the one below the Rugenge secteur office; that grave was dubbed CND. 
Q.	Do you know why it was dubbed CND? 
A.	You see, during the talks, RPF people came to Kigali and were quartered at the CND, so it was a way of making people understand that the Inyenzi had to settle at the CND.  It was just a way of making people understand that they would go and join people of their like. 
Q.	In April 1994, did you know a person called Jean Bosco Higiro -- or Higiro? 
A.	I know Bosco, yes. 
Q.	Can you tell us whether he -- like you, was a refugee at CELA or not? 
A.	He lived at the CELA centre. 
Q.	And do you remember whether he was there during the attack on the 22nd of April or not? 
A.	I think he was present, because there was no other place where we could take shelter, and there was only one place of exit from that centre.  
MS. MELLUISH:
That name, by the way, is number 83.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Also in April 1994, did you know someone called Joseph Bitega? 
A.	Yes, I know Bitega because I studied with his sister.  
Q.	Did you see him at CELA whilst you were there? 
A.	Yes, I did. 
Q.	And do you recall whether or not he was present during the attack on the 22nd of April?  

Did you hear the question, Madam Witness? 
A.	He was there, I saw him. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And now we have two versions of that name, but you want the version spelt in number 20, don't you, with other words with a "B"?  
MS. MELLUISH:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	At the beginning of your testimony today, you said that you left CELA on the 22nd of April.  Where did you go to when you left CELA? 
A.	From CELA, I went to the Sainte Famille church. 
Q.	And when you got to Sainte Famille church, what did you find there? 
A.	Many refugees -- some of them had fled the acts of violence from the Interahamwe.  Others had fled the fighting at Gisozi.  I also found some of the people who had been with me at the CELA centre.  I also found Rwanga's family, including his wife and his daughter, Hyacinthe Rwanga.  There were also many other people there, who were experiencing very difficult living conditions -- even though there was some people who seemed unconcerned by what was going on.  
MS. MELLUISH:
Hyacinthe Rwanga is number 246. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you left CELA for Sainte Famille on the 22nd, was that so? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Afternoon, evening, approximately?  
THE WITNESS:
It was around 3:00 in the afternoon.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Can you recall how long you stayed at Sainte Famille? 
A.	I stayed at the Sainte Famille church from that date -- that is to say, the 22nd of April, and it is around the 19th -- or the 20th, that I went to Kabuga. 
Q.	The 19th or 20th of what month? 
A.	Of June, 1994. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And with "Kabuga", you mean the location, not the person? 
THE WITNESS:
It is a location which was controlled by the RPF, and that is where UNAMIR would evacuate people within the framework of their refugee evacuation operations. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Whereabouts in the Sainte Famille parish did you stay? 
A.	I was inside the church -- behind the altar.  
Q.	Can you estimate how many other people were staying inside the church? 
A.	There were many people in the church, and there were two separate categories of refugees.  There was one group of refugees that was close to the altar and that place had also been nicknamed CND.  

And now the building has been changed and this is next to the main entrance.  There was another part that was nicknamed "Camp Hutu" that was safer.  So, the group in which I was was the group where there were problems.  But what I can tell you is that there were very many refugees in the church. 
Q.	And what do you mean by problems?  What problems did your group have? 
A.	It was an area which was exposed to danger.  During that period, if you were Tutsi -- and, as you can see, we had been placed in an area which was different from that of the other group and this place was nicknamed CND.  And we were always being watched over.  We could not even go to the other group in order to hide or try to escape danger.  So, we had problems.  We didn't have any water, no food -- we had many problems and we were always facing death.  
Q.	Who had placed you in that area that you considered to be dangerous? 
A.	I do not know who did it, but during that period, just anybody could give you orders -- even a small child.  We asked the priest to tell us where to hide and that was the place that was shown to us.  I do not know who had selected the area for our group.  
Q.	Which priest did you ask? 
A.	Father Munyeshyaka. 
Q.	You said that when you were in the area called CND, you were always being watched over.  Who was watching over you? 
A.	The other refugees would be watching us, as well as gendarmes -- and even amongst the refugees, there were Interahamwe who would watch us. 
Q.	These other refugees that were watching you, were they -- were they Hutu or Tutsi or neither? 
A.	They were Hutu who were claiming that they had fled because of the insecurity brought about by the Inyenzi.  
Q.	Now, in the time that you stayed at Sainte Famille, did you ever see the Préfet Renzaho at that place? 
A.	I saw him on the 17th of June when people were killed at the Sainte Famille church, amongst which my friend, Hyacinthe. 
Q.	Can you tell us what time of day you saw the préfet? 
A.	It was before noon when we heard that the préfet was in the compound of the church.  Now we feared him and we thought that whenever he came, people would get killed.  So we took fright and we went to check whether he was, indeed, present and I saw him with Father Munyeshyaka when both of them were going to the procure. 
Q.	Before that -- that day, had anything unusual happened or not? 
A.	The previous night, the RPF had evacuated refugees who were at the Saint Paul centre.  And the next day, there was this attack and the attackers were saying that they were seeking revenge because they claimed that the Tutsi had killed some Hutu.  But that had not been the case, because the RPF had evacuated the Tutsi refugees who had problems.  So, it was on the next day that they came.  
Q.	When you saw Renzaho with Father Munyeshyaka, was there anyone else with them or were they alone? 
A.	When they got down -- there were two of them -- but there were already a number of attackers in the compound of the church.  The Interahamwe would be climbing the walls of the compound.  Every single time there was an attack, there would be a terrible noise.  There would be a lot of noise, whistling and they were shooting all over the place.  There were also the officials -- such as, the conseiller and the inspector, as well as many other people who were awaiting a final decision.  I thought they were coming from a meeting where they had decided what they would do. 
Q.	Just to clarify, you mentioned a conseiller, which conseiller is that? 
A.	The conseiller of Rugenge, Mrs. Odette Nyirabagenzi. 
Q.	And the inspector, who was that? 
A.	It is Angeline Mukandituye. 
Q.	And when you first saw those two people, were they together with or apart from Renzaho? 
A.	There were not only two people, there were many people.  I gave you the names of those I was able to recognise, but when I saw these two ladies, they were not with Renzaho.  At that time, Renzaho was with Father Munyeshyaka and was going towards the procure.  And when these people came, they had a list and it is that list that the Interahamwe used -- and let me tell you, *********************************************.  

Father Munyeshyaka, I cannot say that it was because he was good to us that he did that.  But during that period, people would take advantage of other people because it was Father Munyeshyaka who wanted to sexually exploit Hyacinthe, but Hyacinthe refused.  So, in order to avenge himself, Father Munyeshyaka asked her to set up a list because the UNAMIR would evacuate people on the basis of lists provided.  So he asked her to write a list on which she would -- should put the names of her closest friends, so that when UNAMIR would come on the following day, in order to evacuate people towards Kabuga, that list would be used.  So, he stated that he was going to give that list to UNAMIR.  

So we thought we would have been spared because Father Munyeshyaka had forcefully kissed Hyacinthe, and Hyacinthe had come back crying.  And I told her that maybe the priest felt guilty and wanted to help her.  So *********************** and I told her that probably, on the next day, we would finally be saved.  ********************************************************************************************** ********************************************************************************************************************* 

And the following day, in the morning, it is that list that they used to put people to death -- that list we 
********************************.  But when they went out, I saw Father Munyeshyaka with that list in his hand and I recognised the sheet of paper, **************************************************************, and it is with that list that the Interahamwe killed people. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the friend, the spelling is Hyacinthe, H-Y-A-C-I-N-T-H-E, is that correct? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  
MS. MELLUISH:
Thank you, Your Honour, for that clarification, but the name is that that appears at 246 and we've been spelling it differently throughout proceedings to date.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm raising this because we have two versions in the transcripts.  So shall we then adopt the 246 model then and start with the Y, not with the H? 
MS. MELLUISH:
I think that would be easiest. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Now, you say that you saw the list ********************* in the hands of Father Munyeshyaka on the 
17th of June, what makes you say that the Interahamwe used that list? 
A.	I am saying so because the order in which the names came on the list was the very same order in which the names were read out -- and those were the people who were killed.  

My name was also on the list.  Perhaps he could also -- have also drawn a list, but ******************** ****************************************** and that is in -- it -- and it is that order that the names were read out.  And, besides, ***************************************************************** and I could not be mistaken. 
Q.	You say people were killed.  Can you describe how the killing took place? 
A.	Préfet Renzaho and Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka came out of the church compound.  Quite often -- immediately before killings took place, we would no longer see the ringleader -- if I may use that word.  But, after the killings, the father would also come back and say:  "Oh, it was unfortunate I was not present, and I did not hear of what had happened."  But we could see that he was well aware of what had happened.  Maybe he felt guilty.  But there was nothing we could say; there was nothing we could do against him.  

Now, regarding the 22nd, at CELA, the Interahamwe came and killed people.  But on that day, there were killings perpetrated even in the compound of the church -- in the garden facing the priests' house.  They came into the church and started shooting.  They even shot at the statue of the Virgin Mary saying that she was a Tutsi.  And next to the altar, there were people who were injured and who were being treated at the Sainte Famille church.  The Interahamwe came and finished them off.  They read the names on the list and they killed people in the garden facing the priests' house; it was a horrific scene.  The Interahamwe were pronouncing -- were uttering terrible words.  

After the killings, the attackers said that the Hutu had just been killed by the Inyenzi and there was nothing we could say.  Hyacinthe was killed.  When the Interahamwe came -- and since her name was the first one on the list, they were saying that they were looking for Hyacinthe.  She went to hide in a room; they tracked her down, went into that room and shot her in the head three times close to her ear.  Once they reached the name of Hyacinthe's mother on the list, they told her that they could spare her because her children had already died.  

They killed many people on that day.  Young people; it was a grizzly scene.  We knew the Interahamwe.  We knew that they were acting as animals.  But on that day, it was truly horrible.  I cannot even describe the scene to you.  
Q.	Do you know where Renzaho was while this killing was taking place? 
A.	He would go out -- he would go out and ask his dogs to attack us. 
Q.	Did you personally see him again after that first time? 
A.	I did not see him again, but in the evening, the father provided explanations; that is all I can say.  
Q.	Are you able to estimate for how long this attack took place? 
A.	On the 22nd, the attack lasted a long time.  I can say that it lasted throughout the day.  After the Interahamwe, a policeman arrived -- when the bodies of our friends and our family members were still there.  The policeman arrived and said that it was not possible to kill all the Tutsi.  And he said:  "You, the Hutu, go out, we are going to destroy the church."  It is as if the -- these people were starting to move.  It took a while and subsequently, they were told that UNAMIR was coming, and they thought that UNAMIR was coming to save us.  That is when they shot in the air and retreated.  It was in the evening, and usually they would kill during the day, and at night they would rest.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, you have referred to the 22nd on a couple of occasions.  This attack which you are now describing, which date was that? 
THE WITNESS:
The attack took place on the 17th of April. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.  
THE WITNESS:
These events I'm recounting are quite sad and I -- I wish to apologise to you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And now you said April, is that what you mean? 
THE WITNESS:
It was on the 16th or 17th of June, it was in the month of June.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have some questions left, haven't you? 
MS. MELLUISH:
A few, Your Honour, but we could break. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I would think this would be a good moment for a break.  We will have the 11 o'clock break a bit earlier today and start in about 20 minutes.  

The Court is adjourned. 
(Court recessed from 1053H to 1124H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before we proceed, just a small administrative matter.  Before the break, we had a spelling of Hyacinthe and the witness confirmed the spelling.  Then, reference was made to a Prosecution spelling list.  I think it does happen that even Prosecution spelling lists may have mistakes and we should probably not be bound by them throughout the trial.  So I've asked someone now kindly to go through that list.  We will still continue to write Hyacinthe with a H, which is normal practice in French.  And I also think that Kajagari, which was another issue a couple of days ago, will have to go back to Akajagali, which has been the spelling throughout the life span of this Tribunal, with all due respect to the Prosecution spelling list.  

Now, let us continue. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Madam Witness, are you able to estimate to this Tribunal how many people were killed at Sainte Famille on the 17th of June 1994? 
A.	I am not able to give you any precise number because all the people were not killed at the same place.  Some were killed in the courtyard.  Others were killed in the stairs that go from the procure to the presbytery.  Others were killed in the garden.  In other words, many people were killed on that day.  And some even died inside the church -- that is to say, those who were injured and who were being treated there.  Let me tell you that we were all afraid, and the operation only ended in the evening.  On the following day, the dead bodies were piled up somewhere, and I'm truly not in any position to give you any specific number. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This part of the church referred to as the procure, P-R-O-C-U-R-E, where exactly was that, madam?  
THE WITNESS:
The procure was between the buildings where we had the économat général, and the garden -- or, the place where Hyacinthe was killed.  Between the two, there was a petrol pump and that is where the entrance of the procure was, where there are buildings where visitors were housed.  And that was the entrance that would be used for the refugees who would come to that site, because the other exits -- or entrances had been closed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Now, Madam Witness, you told us about your friend Hyacinthe, and you said that she had come to you and told you that she had been forcefully -- I think you said forcefully kissed by Father Munyeshyaka.  Do you recall any such incidences of -- of that nature taking place at Sainte Famille, while you were there? 
A.	Yes, Father Munyeshyaka had another young lady amongst the refugees who had almost become his sexual slave during that period.  During that period, he would abuse young girls.  
Q.	Did anyone else abuse young girls at Sainte Famille besides Father Munyeshyaka or was he the only person doing that? 
A.	As I stated previously, there were other Interahamwe on the site -- and even Interahamwe, who had come from elsewhere, could go into the centre without any problem.  When they needed one person, they would come and abduct that person.  There were no safety measures to protect those who were being sought after.  Young girls were raped; others were executed.  And if there are women or young ladies who were not raped, it was because they were fortunate because it was customary for rapes to take place. 
Q.	And how did you know about this happening? 
A.	There are young women or ladies who would be taken away and who would subsequently come back.  And there was even one lady who was mentally disturbed and who was raped by the Interahamwe at Hotel Africa, but she came back afterwards -- even if it -- it was said that she was dead at the time.  You do know that anybody who is mentally ill cannot hide anything, and she told us everything that had happened.  

I know of another young woman who was abducted by the Interahamwe -- I mentioned his (sic) name was Cimba, and the Interahamwe made her believe that this was a way of sparing her life.  Unfortunately, she subsequently died.  So these events were well known and it was no secret.  
Q.	Thank you.  

I think the name given was Cimba, C-I-M-B-A.  

Thank you, Madam Witness, I have no more questions for you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before cross-examination, Madam Witness, just a clarification, the list which you referred to on the 22nd of April, you said that you saw that list? 
THE WITNESS:
Concerning the list of the 22nd, I told you that I saw it when certain Interahamwe came back to the centre.  So, they were reading out names of some people which were on the list and who had already died.  So it was some sort of a stocktaking to identify those who were already dead and those who had not yet been killed.  And when the Interahamwe were reading names on that list, they were close to me, because I was lying on the ground and there was a screen separating us, so I could see them. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you see that list in open air or inside the building?  Where were you? 
THE WITNESS:
I was in a small room near the shed where I had spent the night.  The CELA buildings had big windows with screens, and I could see those Interahamwe because of that screen between us.  But the Interahamwe did not see me and they did not know that I was there -- especially because that room itself had been locked and they were speaking to one another and reading out names from that list.  

When I left CELA, I actually knew the people who had already died, and those whom had not yet been caught by the Interahamwe.  The day following my departure, the Interahamwe came back to the 
Sainte Famille site in an effort to locate the people who had not yet been killed.  But on that day, they didn't see anyone. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just listen to the question and answer them briefly, please.  Now, what kind of screen are you referring to? 
THE WITNESS:
I'm trying to explain to you that even though I was in that room, I could see through the glass pane and see what was going on outside the room where I was.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I leave the rest for cross-examination, Defence, thank you.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Most obliged, Mr. President.
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning.  
Q.	Witness, in describing the events at CELA, you said in chief that a few days before the 22nd of April 1994, there had been community work in that place.  Do you remember having said that to the Prosecutor? 
A.	Yes, I do.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Please tell the Court about how many days that work was carried out before the attack on the 22nd of April? 
A.	When we went to CELA, we did not have any calendars, we did not have any watches, we did not have any radio stations in order to be able to know the exact date.  But I can tell you that the community development work -- umuganda was carried out while we were there.  Even though they referred to it as umuganda, it was just a way of clearing the surroundings so that we could be quite visible and easily accessible.  
Q.	Yes, actually, Witness, I just want to know whether you are able to know the number of days which elapsed, because you said the work was carried out in preparation for the attack.  Was it two, three or four days before -- as far as you can remember, that is? 
A.	Even if you'd asked me to give you a number of approximate days, I will need to take a reference point.  I simply told you that between the date when the work was carried out and the date of the attack, a few days elapsed, but I cannot tell you how many days.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  What about the day of the attack itself -- that is, the 22nd of April 1994, was there any community work? 
A.	That day, I would say that the people who arrived there, wanted to prevent us from going out through any road, but on that day, they entered the CELA compound.  However, there had been community development work, as I referred to it, between CELA and the JOC.  But when they entered CELA, they even cut down the banana plants and any shrubbery around that centre; they cleared up everything.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Talking about that attack of the 22nd of April 1994, if I understood you properly, Witness, it appears as if the Interahamwe came to CELA on that date twice:  The first time with 
Mr. Renzaho, when they picked out people who were either or not on the list which they had; and the second time, when you were hiding in that room that you just described to us a while ago.  Is that correct? 
A.	No, Counsel, I think you did not quite understand me.  
Q.	Can you therefore be more explicit, Witness?  Was it during the same attack that the Interahamwe used the list twice, or did the Interahamwe first go, then they came back -- from your description? 
A.	Concerning the attack of the 22nd of April, I told you that Préfet Renzaho ordered that the refugees be separated in various groups; that sorting was carried out.  And, when I went down, I saw another group of people who had been asked to kneel down in the garden.  Then, I went and hid in that room.  

I learnt of that list only when the Interahamwe came back later on to loot that centre, and when they were talking amongst themselves -- and, sort of comparing notes.  Otherwise I don't believe I said that I saw Renzaho with any list.  
Q.	Very well, Witness.  When the Interahamwe came with that list which you saw, Mr. Renzaho was no longer there; correct? 
A.	That is right, Mr. Renzaho was no longer there any longer.  
Q.	But, Witness, the second trip of the -- of the Interahamwe after Mr. Renzaho's departure, did you mention it when you had your interview with the investigators of the Prosecutor? 
A.	Are you referring to the episode when the Interahamwe read names out of the list?  I don't remember whether I mentioned it in my statement -- but today, I'm telling you that that is how the things happened.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  However, Witness, I would like us to take a look at the statement you gave regarding those events of the 22nd of April 1994.  
MR. NEKUIE:
And, Your Honours, it is the witness statement recorded on the 22nd of August 2000 and signed -- December 2000.  The French version is 153328 -- and I'm on page 3, which is the single page of the statement given by the witness.  The date when it was signed was the 9th of December 2000.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, allow me to jog your recollection on a significant event which you described during that interview, and I'll then put questions to you.  

Concerning the 22nd of April, on line 9 of that page 3, at the end of that line, this is what you said: "Militiamen -- the militiamen threw grenades into the men's group, killing about 100 of them." 

Witness, do you remember making such a statement in connection with the events at CELA? 
A.	It is -- it is true that grenades were thrown into the refugees and Gihana, whom we knew very well, died.  And if I mentioned about a hundred of victims, it is because a lot of blood was spilled.  There were bodies cut into pieces.  And at that time, I estimated it was about 100.  I don't know whether there was an investigation conducted subsequently to ascertain the exact number of victims, but that is what I said in my statement.  
Q.	Yes, Witness, kindly tell the Court at what exact time during (sic) Mr. Renzaho's presence in that 
area -- in that compound that the grenades were thrown? 
A.	Counsel, I told you we were not on a picnic; we had gone to seek refuge -- it was not on a merry trip, so we did not have our wristwatches with us.  All what I know is that when the grenade was thrown, the people who had been selected to be killed had not yet left, and I told you that from the high ground where I was, I could see Renzaho.  But, I don't know whether he was there at the exact time when that grenade was thrown because I was no longer watching -- I was no longer seeing him, but I could not see him because I had left that high ground where I was before.  
Q.	So, were the grenades thrown at those people who had been selected, if I understand you correctly? 
A.	No, the grenades were thrown into the group of people who were in the garden and who they wanted to move.  It was in the part of the centre where a bungalow had been built.  
Q.	Witness, did all the refugees who were with you see the grenade being thrown on that group you're referring to? 
A.	The garden is not located at the same place where Renzaho was because Renzaho was near the main entrance to CELA, whereas the garden was a bit further away and below.  So, there is some distance between the two places. 
Q.	(No interpretation)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter did not get the first part of counsel's question. 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Hold on.  

Could you kindly repeat your question, Counsel? 
MR. NEKUIE:
My question to the witness was to know whether Jean Bosco Higiro and Joseph Bitega were amongst the group of people on whom the grenades were thrown. 
THE WITNESS:
I think that's a question you may want to put to those people, because anyone can talk about the events which he witnessed or which were experienced by people immediately close to him.  I think that is what you may want to do.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, you see, I'm putting that question to you because when Prosecution counsel asked you questions about those people, you said you saw them on the 22nd of April.  Where did you see them on that day? 
A.	When I saw -- I saw those people on the 22nd, it was because we all stayed at CELA centre up until that day.  But I cannot tell you exactly where Bitega was or where Higiro was standing.  I am unable to confirm to you that they were in that group of people at whom the grenades were lobbed.  I am categoric about Gihana because Gihana died of the grenade wounds -- and that was even being talked about before we left CELA.  And when I left CELA, I was able to see his body.  
Q.	Witness, how were you told to go and attend the meeting which the préfet had convened that day at CELA? 
A.	The Interahamwe found us in the room where we were; they were armed -- some of them with grenades, others with guns, and others with machetes and spears.  Each and every one of them was armed in one way or the other.  They were dressed in strange clothings and were shouting.  They asked us to go up -- because there was a meeting.  I was not the one particularly invited, given that the statement was addressed to the entire group.  And I should say that some of those militiamen had on feathers of birds. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know the first name of Mr. Gihana, Madam Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
No, I don't, I'm afraid.  I know he was simply known by the name "Gihana".  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, you said that during that meeting, the préfet told you to return to your respective homes, and that a gendarme later on told you to rather go to Sainte Famille.  Tell us where that gendarme who spoke to you had come from? 
A.	I told you that Préfet Renzaho was accompanied by Interahamwe and gendarmes.  So the gendarme who spoke to me was one of those who had come with the préfet.  He spoke to the group telling us:  "Go back, go back", but he took us aside and murmured to us you should rather go to the 
Sainte Famille, because if you return to your homes, you will be killed there.  

Some of the people, who were with us, returned to their homes, but others shared the information that the gendarme was, rather, advising us to go to the Sainte Famille.  That is how we decided instead of going to our homes to, rather, go to Sainte Famille.  
Q.	Witness, are you certain that it was that gendarme who gave you that advice on that 
22nd of April 1994? 
A.	Yes, I am, because I heard him say that -- I even tried to go after him to seek some explanations from him, but he moved away.  So I hereby confirm that it was the gendarme who gave us that information.  
Q.	Witness, I'm going to read lines 12 and 13 of the statement you gave the Prosecutor.  And then, I will ask you to comment.  

This is what you said -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And since there are several statements, you are now referring to which date, please, just for the record? 
MR. NEKUIE:
The same statement of December 9, 2000, Mr. President, the same page.  The statement signed on the 9th of December, but recorded on the 22nd of August 2000. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Very good.  And now the reading, please.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you.
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	I'm on line 3 -- I mean, line 13, and this is what you said, Witness: "Renzaho called a meeting to order us to proceed to Sainte Famille or Saint Paul church saying that the men will go to the CND." 

Do you remember that statement which you gave the Prosecutor on December 9, 2000, Witness? 
A.	I couldn't have said that because that is not how it happened.  My statement was not properly recorded because what I'm telling you is what happened; that is the truth.  
Q.	So are you saying that those addresses are wrongly ascribed to you in that statement? 
A.	I think there was a mistake -- even this day, you notice that there was a mistake on the personal information sheet.  I don't think I could have been mistaken regarding my address and the various places where I stayed at.  There could have been a mistake in the way some of the information was recorded. 
Q.	Very well, ma'am.  When you hid in that small room that you mentioned a while ago, were you all alone or with some other people? 
A.	I was with other people.  I remember Bernadette and her younger sister who died during an attack, which was launched from the Saint Paul centre.  But, I no longer remember the other people -- and I should state further that I followed them into that small room when I saw them get in. 
Q.	Was it along with those people that you subsequently went to the Sainte Famille church? 
A.	Bernadette was the oldest amongst us.  She was the one who later on advised us to go there.  She even gave money to the Interahamwe who escorted us.  When we arrived at the Saint Paul centre, she was accepted in, but I was denied entrance into the Saint Paul centre.  That is how I went to the Sainte Famille site.  
Q.	Were you accompanied by some of your relatives, if you recall? 
A.	Which event are you referring to?  When I left the CELA centre to go to the Sainte Famille church -- or, would you rather wish to know whether there were members of my family who were also with him (sic) at the Sainte Famille church?  When I left CELA, there were no members of my family with me, but I found them when I reached the Sainte Famille church.  
Q.	And you did all that from 3 p.m. onwards, as you testified; am I correct? 
A.	Well, I did not give you the precise time, it was just an estimation.  I was following the movements of the sun in order to be able to determine what time it was.  
Q.	Witness, could we deem that it was, in any case, in the afternoon? 
A.	Yes, it was in the afternoon.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  

Witness, let me once again refresh your memory and read out your statement dated 9th of December 2000 on this same matter.  
MR. NEKUIE:
I am on the 16th or 17th line, Mr. President, Your Honours, which starts with:  "At about 11 a.m. on the 22nd of April".  So, I'm dealing with the same statement which obviously has the same references -- immediately after CND.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	And this is what you stated, Witness, and I quote:  "At about 11 a.m., on 22nd April 1994, I went to the Sainte Famille church with my paternal aunt, my two cousins and one female cousin."  Do you remember having made such a statement, Witness? 
A.	I could not have made such a statement because this is not how things happened.  The truth is that I was with them at the Sainte Famille church; they (sic) did not leave together.  
Q.	Witness, did you sign this statement after you gave it to the investigators of the -- of the Office of the Prosecution? 
A.	I do not recall.  
Q.	Very well, Witness.  So, this is yet another wrong description of what you stated to the Prosecution; am I correct? 
A.	These family members of mine lived with me.  I was living at their home and at the Sainte Famille church.  I was with him -- with -- with them.  But when I went to Sainte Famille, coming from CELA, I was not with them.  There might have been a communication problem because we were speaking different languages.  
Q.	Yes, Witness, so it is because of this communication problem that no reference was made to the second attack of the Interahamwe, with a list at CELA -- a list you were able to see on that occasion.  Are we to consider that this was also yet another omission? 
A.	Well, everything depended on the investigator.  One investigator might put a lot of questions to you and then you can provide a lot of information -- or, put few questions to you, and then you won't be as forthcoming with the information you're providing.  I don't see how it would be in my interest not to share the information that is in my possession or to not tell the truth.  
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness.  

Witness, let us now go to the Sainte Famille church and focus on the events of the 17th of June, 1994.  On how many occasions, did -- or, rather, how many times did you see Mr. Renzaho on that day at Sainte Famille? 
A.	I believe I saw him on that morning, but the Interahamwe would come to the church often.  
Q.	But, you only saw him in the morning; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	Did you also see General Munyakaze on the 17th of June 1994 in Sainte Famille? 
A.	I saw Munyakaze on the following day or two days after that, because it was at that point that he came in order to evacuate a number of people.  But I do not believe I saw Munyakaze on that day.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  So, you did not see General Munyakaze in the company of Mr. Renzaho at any point in time.  Would I be correct in making such a suggestion? 
A.	I stated previously that on that day I saw Renzaho in the company of Munyeshyaka while they were going towards the procure.  But I did not see Munyakaze.  
Q.	Very well, Witness.  Witness, let me once again refer to your statement dated 9th of September 2000 and read out to you the lines that come immediately after the ones I read out a moment ago.  And it starts with:  "On 17th of June 1994, before noon."  

Witness, here is what you stated, and I quote:  "On 17th June 1994, before noon, I saw Tharcisse Renzaho, Odette Nyirabagenzi, Angeline Mukandituye and Lieutenant Colonel Laurent Munyakaze." 

Was that, indeed, what you stated, Witness -- or not? 
A.	That is what I stated.  But as for the fact that I allegedly saw him with Munyakaze, I thought I explained to you that all of them were present, but they were not in the same group.  I told you that they went down towards the procure with Angeline, as well as the other Interahamwe, but Renzaho did not go there with Munyakaze towards Munyeshyaka's office.  It was, rather, Renzaho and Munyeshyaka who went to join the Interahamwe as well as the other officials or soldiers who were further down.  
Q.	So, you did see Munyakaze on the 17th of June and subsequently on the 18th of June; am I correct? 
A.	On the 18th, I saw him when he came to evacuate a number of people from the Sainte Famille church.  As regards the 17th, I heard that Munyakaze was amongst the attackers.  I was still young.  I did not know him; I did not know the officers.  I saw Odette and the others and I recognised them because I knew them before.  But when he came back, I was able to recognise him because he had been shown to me.  
Q.	Witness, when describing the killings which were perpetrated -- allegedly perpetrated on the 
17th of June 1994 at Sainte Famille, you stated that the Interahamwe were using a list; am I correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, yes, they had a list.  
Q.	Could you tell the Trial Chamber, Witness, whether it was mainly those who were on that list -- a list which you drew yourself -- who were being sought after, or whether all the refugees were being shot at in a disorderly manner? 
A.	On the 17th, the group of refugees were -- was shot at at random.  But there was also another incident where one Interahamwe was reading out the names on the list, and the names that were being read out are the people -- whose name was being read out, would go to the garden.  

There were people who were killed -- even though they were not on the list.  There were people who were killed inside the church, and they were not on the list either.  There is one child, called Maguru, who was killed on that occasion.  So there were different strategies used during those killings. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That name, please, the spelling? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, in the statement -- one of the statements, it's spelt M-A-G-U-R-U. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
(Pages 18 to 36 by Jean Baigent)

























1215H 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, are you aware of the way in which the different killing incidents ended on the 17th of June 1994? 
A.	The killings on the 17th finally ended because when they would kill people, the attackers would go and rest at some point.  And it was almost nighttime, and the attackers would not kill people during the night.  
Q.	So, if I understand you correctly, Witness, it is because they were tired that the attackers stopped killing; is that what I am to understand? 
A.	I told you that it was said that UNAMIR had just arrived.  I don't know why they feared UNAMIR.  But when UNAMIR agents were there, they would not kill anyone.  So someone said, "UNAMIR is coming."  And they retreated.  And what you're saying is true.  They were tired because they had killed a number of people.  
Q.	Witness, did you mention the arrival of UNAMIR when Madam Prosecutor questioned you regarding the end of the killings?  
A.	I do not recall.  When questions are put to you, and when you are telling the truth, you assume that you have given all the information that was in your possession.  I cannot state with certainty whether this question was put to me and whether I gave such information.  But I can tell you that this is what happened.  
Q.	Could you tell the Chamber what distance there was between the Sainte Famille parish and the Mille Collines hotel where the UNAMIR was stationed?  
A.	I did not measure that distance, but UNAMIR soldiers could arrive where we were at any time.  They were those who evacuated us to Kabuga.  The Mille Collines hotel was not a place where they were staying without being able to go out.  They would often come to where we were.  
Q.	And this will be my last question, Witness:  From what you know, was the Mille Collines hotel far from the Sainte Famille parish?  Since I do understand that you might not be in a position to assess the distance.  
A.	The Mille Collines hotel is not far from the Sainte Famille church.  But during that time, for us, it was quite far.  But in -- under normal circumstances, one can say that it's not very far from the Sainte Famille church.  
Q.	Very well, Madam Witness.  I thank you for having answered the questions put to you by the Defence.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, this marks the end of the cross-examination of Witness HAD, and I would request from the Trial Chamber that it have admitted into evidence a copy of the statement I used during this cross-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  So this is, then, the statement signed on the 9th of December 2000, dated the 22nd of August 2000, the French being the signed version, the English the unsigned version.  A for the French, B for the English.

MR. PRESIDENT:

Thank you, Mr. President.  
RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Madam Witness, you've just described how somebody announced that UNAMIR was coming and the Interahamwe left, on the 17th of June.  Now, it was suggested in the questions that UNAMIR did in fact arrive on the 17th of June.  Could you clarify for the Chamber whether, as far as you're aware, UNAMIR came on that day, or not?  
A.	The UNAMIR soldiers did not come on that day.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Witness, I am coming back to this list on the 22nd of April again.  Now, the person holding the list, was he in the same room as you were?  
THE WITNESS: 
The person holding the list was an Interahamwe, and he was outside.  I was hiding in that room that was next to the place where the Interahamwe was standing.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, I know that this person was an Interahamwe, Madam Witness.  But you referred to "the screen".  Explain once again what you meant by that.  We have now clarified that the Interahamwe is outside the room, and you are inside the room.  So where does this screen come into place?  
THE WITNESS: 
The window I was telling you about was -- I referred to was simply to explain to you that I could see what was happening outside through the window.  I cannot see what is happening behind you because there is a wall behind you.  But you could see the Interahamwe through the window of the place where I was lying down.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, and this is quite clear to everyone in the courtroom, Madam Witness.  Does that mean, then, that you simply was looking through a window in order to see the list outside?  
THE WITNESS: 
I could not read out what was on the list.  They were the ones who were reading out what was on the document, and I could hear what they were saying.  And this is how I understood what was on the list.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  And we have also understood this.  Now, listen very carefully to the question.  The question is not what you think it was.  The question is:  You were simply looking through a window, then, in order to see the list.  To see it.  Not to hear anything.  
THE WITNESS: 
When I looked through the window, my objective was not to see the list, because I didn't know they had the list.  I simply wanted to know what was happening to see whether they were about to launch another attack against the place where we were.  So I was not interested in the list, per se.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Also perfectly understandable, Madam Witness.  Now, was there glass in the window?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, there was glass.  In fact, it's as if the whole wall was made up of a window pane.  It was bay -- they were bay windows. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So you simply looked through the glass in order to see the list; there was nothing else separating you from the list.  You simply looked through the glass in the window.  Is that the evidence?  
THE WITNESS: 
They were right next to the place where I was.  It's as if they were leaning on the wall that was close to the window.  So I could not see their faces.  But I could see part of their bodies, and I could see the list.  I could not see their faces because I was behind them.  I could only see their backs.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This is my last attempt, Madam, and then this will be the last question.  There was nothing else separating you from the list than the glass in the window.  There was no curtain, there was no screen, non-transparent, only glass.  Have I understood it correctly?  
THE WITNESS: 
There were curtains in a transparent material, which I could see through.  So I could see easily.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So you saw the list through the curtains?  
THE WITNESS: 
No, it was not even necessary for me to draw the curtains.  I could see through without drawing the curtains.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's fine, Madam Witness.  
This was the end of your testimony.  Thank you very much for having come the long way to Arusha to testify.  We wish you a very safe journey home.  Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you very much.  

Is Maître Cantier close to the courtroom?  This could be a good time to discuss some scheduling issues in connection with the remainder of the Prosecution case.  Could he be asked to come, or should we, rather, adjourn and do it at 3 o'clock?  I do not know what would be the preference of the parties.  
MR. MOSES: 
I'm in Your Honour's hands.  I'm -- 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, if this is the Trial Chamber's wish, we can go and get Counsel Cantier, who is certainly somewhere downstairs.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Are you ready to address scheduling matters now, Mr. Moses?  
MR. MOSES: 
I am.
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  But then if the Defence could kindly ask him to come, that would be highly appreciated.  Thank you.  

Meanwhile, we could start with the witnesses for next week, please.  
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  There are six remaining for next week.  Three arrive tomorrow.  And the order for the witnesses:  The first will be MW, the second will be AWN, and the third will be UI.  So they all arrive on this Friday.  Three remaining witnesses arrive on Monday, and they will be called in in this order, hopefully, Your Honour:  AWO, KBZ, and AWX.  So, I think it's -- it's highly likely their evidence, all of these remaining witnesses is reasonably brief.  So I think we will conclude by Tuesday, if not Wednesday, at the latest.  If I can advise that.  

If can I also put on record, Your Honour, that there are two witnesses who we can formally drop at this stage.  The first of those is GI, and the second is MF.  They're both other CELA witnesses, and we've already heard a number of witnesses from -- and those.  So those two are to be dropped by the Prosecution.  

That leaves on the list, Your Honours, three remaining witnesses.  The first is ACK.  That is the witness who is sick.  Now, she was spoken to on Monday and at that stage indicated that she thought she was in fact too unwell even to do a video conference.  Subsequently, yesterday she has indicated a willingness to at least try and do that, and has -- in respect of that, indicated she will try and get a medical certificate faxed through to us sometime later today, though.  We have drafted a motion in French, and you will be -- my friends will be pleased to know that it wasn't myself that drafted it in French.  But that should avoid there being a delay in the Defence responding to it.  

So that, potentially, subject to their -- my friends' attitude, and obviously, more importantly, Your Honours' attitude to that application, there is potentially a video link.  If you see the name of the witness, it's a name which has arisen, and family members who have arisen.  We are certainly reluctant to withdraw or drop that witness.  

That would leave two other witnesses.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Video link from Rwanda, or (microphones overlapping) 
MR. MOSES: 
No, a video link from another North American country. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
MR. MOSES: 
That would leave two other witnesses.  The first is BKX, who was to be called to give evidence as to the voice identification.  We've now heard four people give that evidence.  Clearly Your Honours are more interested in -- from -- or, more concerned, I should say, with where the tape came from.  We have now located the person that we believe taped that and who provided it not only to the Rwandan government, but in fact under a separate K number has apparently provided it to the Tribunal, or the investigators, as far back as 1995.  That person is being seen in a European country at the moment, and has indicated a -- a willingness to -- to testify.  It would be very brief evidence.  That person is unable to identify the Accused's voice, but would be able to testify as to how and where he recorded that.  

So there would be potentially another motion to be filed early next week, and we would try and do that in French as well.  A drop/add motion, to drop BKX, and to add this other witness, subject to what he tells us in the next day -- day or so.  But that's our intention, if I can indicate at the moment.  

And then the final witness would be that of Dr. Des Forges.  In respect of her, she is available in the weeks -- or, the time period that Your Honours tentatively arranged, and around that time period.  The issue so far as her -- she is concerned has to do with the translation of her report.  Yesterday we were advised by the translation department that they have translated her report into French, subject to it being revised.  Now, we can apparently obtain, either today or perhaps tomorrow, and disclose the unrevised translation of her report.  The difficulty, if I can say, is that we have also been advised that there are higher priorities which would mean that the revised report may be one or two weeks away.  Obviously if my friends are -- depending on -- the 21 days, if that can be from the date of the translated but unrevised copy, then that gives, I think, Your Honours and ourselves a wider span in terms of times that might -- the 21 days would be able to run perhaps from today or tomorrow, and that may, in turn, ease the scheduling issues.  

So I think I've addressed everything that I can at the moment.  I indicated earlier this week as to the approximate times that I thought the evidence-in-chief would take.  I think Your Honours will note from -- from both parties that the times we indicated have actually been less than that which has been indicated, and I think this week we've actually got through -- completed and finished eight witnesses, which is, certainly in my experience at the Tribunal, some form of record for Prosecution witnesses.  Maybe not for Defence, but certainly in terms of Prosecution.  But it's -- we've certainly made good -- good progress, if I can say that.  

So whether that assists in terms of the length of time that will be required to conclude those three witnesses, I will leave to Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  

We have now identified the six witnesses for next week.  We have heard that two witnesses have been dropped, and we know that there will potentially be three remaining witnesses, one by video link, one, if granted by the Chamber, following a motion to vary the witness list, and the expert witness.  

Could we start in the end of translation with the expert witness?  The translation is available, it can be disclosed now.  Revision is usually simply a double check of the quality of the French.  Could we agree that this will not cause a problem so that we can consider the report having been made available in its unrevised form?  That would, of course, facilitate matters.  Defence?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President.  Regarding the witnesses for next week, no problem.  Concerning the motion for adding new witnesses, well, we will look at it.  Concerning Dr. Des Forges' report, if actually we receive the first version, Mr. President, then we are going to consider it as such, unless there is a subsequent revision regarding essential points.  But we can start working on the first version of it, provided it is disclosed to us.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's a good approach.  So, I think in all the probability this will solve the problem and the Defence will then receive it today or tomorrow, I understand.  Thank you very much.  
There is a need for about two to three weeks in order to ensure that witnesses can appear and video links can be arranged.  

In view of other scheduling issues, could we now fix Thursday the 1st and Friday the 2nd of February (sic) for the remaining testimony of the Prosecution, possibly followed into the next week, starting on Monday the 5th, it being understood that a maximum of about three days will probably be all that is needed.  That would be a window which both parties could live with?  With other words, a time span from the 1st of -- sorry, I'm mixing up the months, here.  I mean the 1st of March, 1st and 2nd of March, following on to the 5th and 6th of March.  Would that be a good time span?  
MR. MOSES: 
That would be a very -- I think very good for us, especially if this witness is operated on in the next week or so, then it would give some time for recovery.  So it would be good for the Prosecutor.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What about the Defence, could this be agreeable?  
MR. CANTIER: 
I don't see any particular impediment.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's very helpful.  

We realise that the question which is now being asked could be slightly premature, because there are still six witnesses to be heard next week, plus one to three witnesses in that additional Prosecution slot which we have just decided.  But would it be possible to indicate the commencement of the period for the Defence case, roughly?  If we end this Prosecution case no later than Wednesday the 7th of March -- it's probably earlier -- could sometime in May then be a good time?  You may wish to reflect on this, it's not necessary to make any decisions today.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, if you allow us time, because I am really not at ease right now to assess the work to be done and the time needed for that work to be done, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will leave it at that for the time being.  Thank you very much to both parties.  

Is there anything of an administrative nature, or shall we simply decide to meet Monday at 8:45?  That seems to be the best approach.  

So the Court is adjourned.  Have a nice weekend.
