MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are called to order. 

Registrar, could you read out the case before the Chamber?  
MR. KIYEYEU: 
Thank you, Madam President.

Trial Chamber II of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of 
Judge Arlette Ramaroson, presiding, is now sitting in open session, today, Friday, 
the 10th of March 2006, for the pre-trial conference in the matter of the Prosecutor versus 
Tharcisse Renzaho, Case No. ICTR-97-31-T. 
MR. KIYEYEU:
Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Registry.  

Could we have the appearances for the parties, beginning with the Prosecutor?  
MR. MOSES: 
Yes, may it please, Your Honour, counsel's name is Moses, I appear for the Prosecution this morning, together with -- and Ms. Melluish, who is assistant trial attorney and Mr. Margan, our case manager.  Thank you, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

The Defence, please?  
MR. CANTIER: 
My respects, I am François Cantier, lead counsel for Mr. Tharcisse Renzaho. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I thank you, Counsel. 

So, this hearing is a pre-trial conference, pursuant to Rule 73 bis, and I would immediately give the floor to the Prosecutor to know how far we have gone with this matter. 
MR. MOSES: 
Yes.  Thank you, Your Honour. 

Your Honour, if one looks at the last time we met together, which was on the 3rd of June last year, there were a number of issues that Your Honour and the Defence raised primarily regarding disclosure -- some disclosure issues, translation issues, and there was also a direction from 
Your Honour asking the Prosecutor to file his pre-trial brief in respect of the matter by the end of October. 

Your Honour, if one looks at those matters that were raised, all translation issues, to the best of my knowledge, have been -- all matters have now been translated.  So, there are no outstanding translation issues at present.  If there are new documents which come into our hands, obviously, we will disclose those and ask for, where appropriate or necessary, for the documents to be translated, but at the moment, we do not have any translation problems.  

Your Honour, you will be aware that after the last pre-trial conference, there was a motion filed to amend the indictment which was granted by the Trial Chamber earlier this year, and the pre-trial brief which Your Honour had asked us to file was done so and filed on the 31st of October last year.  So far as the Prosecution is concerned, Your Honour, we are ready to proceed to trial when there is available court time, and obviously, we will need some -- need some time in order to obtain any order to transfer any detained witnesses, as is the usual situation, Your Honours.  But that apart, Your Honours - 
Your Honour, I don't really have any other issues to raise with Your Honour.  As far as the Prosecution is concerned, we -- I believe the matter is ready for trial.  

Thank you, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I thank you. 

The Chamber would like to ask the Defence to speak.
MR. CANTIER:
Thank you, Madam President.  After the hearing of the 3rd of June 2005, with the assistance of 
Mr. Adjovi, we attempted to solve the problem of disclosures, not without problems, but I believe that as of today, that issue has been dealt with.  The last disclosures -- or the last disclosure we received the day before yesterday.  As far as we are concerned, we would like to file a preliminary motion.  And, considering that our time limits started running from the disclosure of the documents by the Prosecutor after asking for the confirmation of the indictment.  

Madam President, your Chamber, in its decision of the 8th April 2005, had decided to leave aside provisionally our first preliminary motion, and I would like to quote from your decision.  Since the preliminary motions under Rule 72 had to deal with something that is in force, as the Prosecutor has just said, there is another request for amendment of the indictment and your Chamber accepted that amendment in your decision of the 13th February last and in accordance with your ruling, the indictment was filed on the 16th of February.  Your Chamber gave the Prosecutor a deadline which was the 17th of February.  So, today, as far as the Defence is concerned, we would like to file -- we have already prepared a motion, the preliminary motion which we are going to file in the days that follow.  

Secondly, as far as the situation of the date of the beginning of the trial is concerned, we have just received the authorisation from the United Nations which will allow us to question witnesses who are from that organisation.  So that gives you, I believe, a number of factors which will guide you in your determination of a date for the beginning of the trial.  Those are my observations for the time being. 

I thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, what is your response to that proposal?  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, I don't want to get into a legal debate over what the rules do or do not say.  I simply would note for the record, Your Honour, that the direction that was given by the Trial Chamber regarding the 17th of February was for the Prosecutor to file the amended indictment.  So far as the time limits are concerned for filing any preliminary motion, Rule 66(A) (i) is the rule which governs time limits -- I am sorry -- time limits for filing disclosure.  And then in terms of Rule 72, they are to be in writing no later than 30 days after disclosure of the Prosecution -- Prosecution disclosure of statements given provided under Rule 66(A) (i). 

Your Honour will be aware that at the last -- at the initial appearance of this Accused back in June last year, Your Honour, in fact -- and it is noted in the summary of those proceedings, Your Honour, in fact, noted to the Defence that they had the right to file pre-trial motions because that relates to the time limits run from the initial appearance. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed. 
MR. MOSES: 
As I say, Your Honour, I don't want -- if my friend is going to file a motion, we no doubt will respond, but it is certainly the Prosecution's submission that Rule 72 motions are guided by the time and the date on which an initial appearance is made, not by any amendment to an indictment which does not require an initial appearance by an Accused such as is the situation with the most recent amendment to the indictment.  That's the only comment I wish to make regarding the issue.  But, as I say, I don't know that there is anything to be gained by entering into a lengthy legal discussion at the moment.  If my friend is going to file such a motion, we will, in due course, respond to it. 

Thank you, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I would like to ask the Prosecutor a question:  Are the supporting documents for the indictment -- have they all been filed and translated -- and translated?  Because during the last appearance, the Chamber had, in accordance with the provisions -- 

Mr. Cantier, the Chamber gave to you a deadline for the filing of preliminary motions, so the 30 days.  But as far as the new counts and the new charges or the allegations are concerned, that is, rape, there were two new counts and the question, therefore, that I would like to put to the Prosecutor is as follows:  Now, are the documents in support of the indictment and that in accordance with Rule 66 of the 
Rules of Procedure and Evidence, have those documents been filed and translated? 
MR. MOSES: 
Yes, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  

Defence Counsel, the Chamber does not prevent you from filing your motion and we will rule accordingly. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Madam President.  Those documents were disclosed to us, the last of them in the last few days, and that is why we consider that the deadline provided for in Rule 66 only starts running as from now.  

The second question that I would like to put to your Chamber, it concerns your decision on preliminary motions which we brought to the attention of the Court or that we raised against the first indictment.  And in your decision of the 8th of April, you did not rule on it and you stated that preliminary motions which concerned the first indictment had to deal with an indictment that was -- had been accepted.  That is what I would like to say. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber would like to thank you.  There will be no discussions on that.  You are going to file your motion and supporting documents and your arguments and the Chamber would rule accordingly. 
MR. CANTIER:
Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Now, we are going to go on to something else.  I have a number of questions to put to the Prosecution.  Now, first of all, last time you said that on account of the fact that there is an amended indictment, you were going to cut down your number of witnesses.  Now, the Chamber would like to ask you the question:  Did you, indeed, reduce the number of witnesses? 
MR. MOSES: 
Yes, Your Honour.  

I believe the record shows that I indicated that we were relying on 33 factual witnesses.  The last time I appeared, I -- the summary of the status conference has it quoted that Mr. Moses replied that the Prosecutor intends to call approximately 33 witnesses, because there had been 33 witness statements of factual witnesses that had been disclosed in support of that.  The pre-trial brief which we have filed, Your Honour, lists 26 factual witnesses and an investigator and an expert.  So there is a reduction in terms of the factual witnesses from 33 to 26.  And I can also indicate to Your Honour that the Prosecutor would intend, hopefully, to reduce from the 26 factual witnesses by perhaps two or three, maybe more witnesses at trial depending on how the other witnesses who are called to testify perhaps in respect of similar crime scenes how their evidence goes.  So the answer -- the short answer is, yes, Your Honour, we have by almost 20 percent and we intend also to reduce it even further where possible.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  So, in the final analysis, we will have to deal with about 23 witnesses, is that the case; or, rather, you are going to see how things proceed?  Very well. 

Now, as far as your pre-trial brief is concerned, there are no changes; is that the case? 
MR. MOSES: 
That is correct, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Does the Defence have anything to add, as far as that is concerned?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Madam President, just one thing:  A concern because a while ago, I heard the Prosecutor refer to a decision on a transfer order.  I do not know anything about that and that rather bothers me. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I believe that was a mistranslation.  I cannot remember what you said, Prosecutor, but could you please repeat what you said, Prosecutor? 
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, I indicated that all matters were ready for trial.  However, once we receive a trial date in accordance with the rules, we need to apply to transfer any detained witnesses, we will need to apply to transfer any detained witnesses as is the case in all trials where there are detained witnesses. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now, you are -- you understand better.  So, we are expecting your motions and we, therefore, think that taking into account, I believe that is not going to take long since everything has been disclosed and there are no problems, we believe that everything is on schedule.  So I believe that you are going to be informed about the situation and we think that this trial can begin in January 2007, but you will be informed in time. 

I thank you.  If there are no other matters to raise, you are going to be informed in time.  There might be a status conference, but, in any case, you will be informed in time.  In the absence of any other matters from the parties, be it from the Prosecution or from Defence, we are going to put an end to these proceedings. 
MR. CANTIER:
Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings stand adjourned.
