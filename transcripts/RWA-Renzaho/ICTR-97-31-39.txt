MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  The Court is in session.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.

Good morning, Counsel.
WITNESS PAT,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, yesterday we talked about the civilian self-defence and we adjourned by mentioning the presence of Major Bivamvagara in Kigali city.  Do you recall that? 
A.	Yes, I do recall.  
Q.	Witness, with the leave of the Chamber, I would like to request the registrar to give you Exhibit P. 24 and P. 25 that are in the folder of the Prosecution -- in the Prosecution's folder.  

Witness, do you have those documents before you? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  Exhibit P. 24 is a letter from the Rwandan army chief of staff, 30 March 1994, to the minister for defence, and P. 25 is a letter from the préfet of the city of Kigali to the chief of staff of the Rwandan army, and it is dated 31 March 1994.  I would like to read out just the first two paragraphs of the army chief of staff's letter, then the first paragraph of the préfet's letter, then I will ask you a number of questions after that.  Do you agree with that procedure? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	Very well.  The first letter, that of the army chief of staff, this is what is written:  

"Mr. Minister, I have the honour to forward to you the resolutions of the meeting I chaired on 29 March 1994 at the army headquarters of the Rwandan army and to which meeting the following persons were invited, the préfet of the Kigali city and the operations sector commander.  The objective of meeting was to fine-tune the civilian defence plan, whose structure is coordinated by soldiers that are housed within the camp."

That is the end of that paragraph.  

Now, the letter of the préfet to the army chief of staff written on 31 March 1994 states as follows:   

"Mr. Army chief of staff, as part of popular defence, I have the honour to forward to you the list of persons, reserve officers and others chosen by the cellule for civil defence."   

Now, Witness, here is my question:  Don't you think that the presence of Mr. Bivamvagara in the -- in Kigali during the events of April to July 1995 -- 1994 constitutes an implementation of this plan on which the army chief of staff and the préfet of Kigali prepared?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's leading.  Please reformulate.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
I will rephrase my question, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, what is your interpretation of the two quotations I have read out to you? 
A.	The meeting of 29 March 1994 that was held on the initiative of the army chief of staff and to which he convened the préfet and the sector commander came as a result of an appraisal of the general security situation and the situation of hostility in the city of Kigali, a situation where the information and the position of the army headquarters led to the conclusion that there was a risk of the resumption of hostilities.  Whereas the army headquarters realised that ever since the Peace Accords were signed it had done nothing to prepare for war since the country was following a strategy of peace.  Conversely, it realised that the RPF had never stopped preparing for the war.  So that was our appraisal of the enemy situation.  So the civil self-defence mentioned in the letter came to fill a gap without which the Rwandan armed forces would be taken unawares in case of -- peace negotiations.  So the army general staff thought that if there were a resumption of hostilities, with the RPF having a reinforced battalion in Kigali and having a number of infiltrated persons in Kigali and throughout the country, the RPF then could launch an offensive, notably by occupying sensitive areas in Kigali, crossroads and other areas.  

So, it was thought that by using a scenario that had been tested elsewhere, they could set up cellules or units that could at least alert the FAR in the event that such an attempt, as I described above, could be undertaken.  So they were going to use soldiers as the core of that structure because soldiers had been authorised to stay in the neighbourhoods.  So these soldiers were supposed to form the core of the structures, and then other persons appointed by the préfecture -- well, persons who knew how to handle weapons and who had undergone training, notably military reservists, and persons recruited on the basis of discipline, to set up early warning units in the neighbourhoods.  This had been tested in Mutara, Gisenyi, in 1992 and 1993.  And so the army chief of staff considered this organisation some kind of a check, an early warning system.  So that was the objective of the meeting, and the measure that was taken.  
Q.	Thank you for the clarifications.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
Witness, may I ask you a question?  We use here two terms, "civil defence" and "civil self-defence".  Do you see any difference, or these are the same terms?  
THE WITNESS:
The proper term is "civil self-defence" and that is the term used by the army chief of staff and the préfet's letter also uses that term, "civil defence".  But that is not the term that was used in the earlier correspondence.  And since these correspondences are complementary, I believe the use of the term eventually became the same, although the writing was not the same.  But the préfet of Kigali would have used the word "civil self-defence" and that is the term I will continue to use.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
The term "civil self-defence" is correct, but not civil defence, yeah?  
THE WITNESS:
That is correct, Your Honour.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
Just a question, Witness.  From my recollection of your evidence in-chief yesterday, you stated categorically that the Rwandan army did not set up a civil defence mechanism from April to July 1994.  But the long explanation you have given, are you now changing, because I don't understand?  That's what you said yesterday, that there was no civil defence mechanism set up from April to July 1994, in answer to a question put to you by Defence counsel.  Are you now changing, on the basis of what you were just asked on these two documents, are you changing your opinion?  
THE WITNESS:
I am not changing my opinion, Your Honour.  The self-defence scenario that has just been described and that appears in the two letters was not set up; there was no time to set them up.  And we are talking here about the 31st of March, when the préfet wrote the letter.  And I realise that the army chief of staff put his signature on that letter, but three days later he died and hostilities resumed.  

To implement such a scenario, a lot more days were needed than the two days that followed.  And I am sure that the préfet's letter did not receive any response, because it was supposed to be implemented by the operations sector commander to whom the letter was copied, because if you look on the letter, it is written "Copied to the operations sector for Kigali".  And, here, the copy went, but the operations sector commander could not implement that mechanism.  So over the next three months this scenario was not implemented.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	So what link can we establish between this scenario and Mr. Bivamvagara's mission on the ground?  
A.	This mechanism has nothing to do with the mission of Mr. -- Commandant Bivamvagara, who came to Kigali within the context and ministerial instruction to train recruits for fighting troops. So he came to recruit and train fighters for the army; he was not coming to organise the population to defend itself.  
Q.	When you speak of the ministerial instruction, which one are you referring to, Witness? 
A.	Actually, it's a ministerial instruction that was signed in the month of May, but I cannot be precise on the date.  But the truth is that when it was observed that the troops were wearing themselves out after a month of fighting, there was the idea of recruiting to complement the troops and that was done precisely by recruitment.  

But it was a bit unusual from the normal recruitment because there was decentralisation of recruitment and, above all, the centralisation of training, because normally training is done in a camp under the authority of a director, commander of training.  But, here, the préfectures were going to organise training.  So Commander Bivamvagara was somebody who was working within the Kigali city sector command, Ruhengeri or Gisenyi. 
Q.	Thank you for your explanations, Witness.  

Witness, I would like us to talk about one last point of clarification with you in this examination, and then we will move again to the period when you occupied your duties that were different from the second part of the events.  Would you understand what I am talking about?  I would like us to talk about the period of 6th April 1994.  Do you understand me?  
A.	I understand you, Counsel.  
Q.	Perfect.  Witness, I would like to ask you the following question:  In the situation in which you found yourself, was it necessary for you to physically move to the premises of the minister of defence to know whether arms or weapons were stocked there and were being distributed? 
A.	I will say yes to know what was happening physically.  But I will move further and say that in the normal channels of weapons' distribution my position enabled me to know what was happening at the ministry of defence.  Since there are a number of documents that have to be filled and signed, there is an armament statement -- well, the armament situation from a major logistic base was known to me, because it was presented at all meetings of the general staff -- or, at the meeting of the 7th.  

But to have a clear idea of the situation, I had to go there or receive a message that mentioned such distribution.  I did not go to the ministry of defence.  But I didn't have any messages related to the distribution or non-distribution of weapons.  So I am saying that there was no such message at the logistic base.  There was no weapons stock to be given to a third party other than the army at a time when the army clearly lacked such weapons.  So I don't think there was any distribution.  
Q.	Thank you for all your answers, Mr. Witness.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, this is where I end my examination-in-chief of the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Witness, you will soon be cross-examined, but just a question of clarification.  

Yesterday you were asked what the reasons were for the RPF coming out of its barracks on the 7th of April, and you said you couldn't read the minds of the RPF command, and you said that two hours after the assassination you heard that there were RPF soldiers coming from the northern border towards -- and then you mentioned a location.  Can you repeat that location, please?  It sounded either like Kibuye or Kabuye.  Was it Kibuye?  
THE WITNESS:
It's actually Kabuye, K-A-B-U-Y-E.  

And, please, Your Honour, it was two hours after the RPF came out of its quarters, that is, if it came out at 3 p.m., then it was reported at 5 p.m. in Kabuye. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Prosecution?  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, I am wondering if I can just distribute a couple of documents which I may use in the course of cross-examination.  

While that's being done, perhaps I can commence. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, in the position that you held prior to the beginning of May 1994, were you made aware of the deployment of troops in and around Kigali? 
A.	I am sorry, I don't understand.  The deployment of what troops?  RPF you mean?  
Q.	FAR. 
A.	As of 6th or 7th April the FAR troops were in their barracks. 
Q.	Now, I want you to -- after that date, up until the date on which you took up a new position, were you aware of, in general terms, the deployment of FAR troops in and around Kigali? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel.  I was aware. 
Q.	And is it correct that in the middle of April the RPF had been shelling an area in Bicumbi, B-I-C-U-M-B-I, commune in Kigali-Rural, called Gahengeri, G-A-H-E-N-G-E-R-I? 
A.	Yes, the RPF troops, moving from Kagitumba -- I believe you have the spelling.  Kagitumba is the northern tip of Rwanda.  It moved across the park and came to Rwamagana -- you have the spelling of that.  And these are the troops which in mid-April threatened Bicumbi.  
MR. MOSES:
I don't know that we do have.  We do.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And did the military headquarters in Kigali send a Kigali unit to assist in that area sometime between the 15th and 20th of April 1994? 
A.	I am certain that the army headquarters did not send any assistance to that area, which was under the Mutara operations sector commander, M-U-T-A-R-A.  And from Kigali the army headquarters was overwhelmed, so there was no reinforcements that went to the east or the north between the 15th and 30th of April. 
Q.	Now, during the period that you held your first position up until the beginning of May 1994, did you ever meet with the Accused? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And, of course, Mr. Witness, the reason why the question was formulated this way is because we are in open session.  Please remember that when you answer the question.  And, now, the answer?  
THE WITNESS:
I saw the Accused more than once.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And can you tell the Trial Chamber where and when you saw the Accused? 
A.	At the army headquarters, and especially in the early days as from 7 April. 
Q.	When you say "more than once" was the Accused attending daily meetings of senior military officers at army headquarters? 
A.	No.  In all these cases, he did not attend the meetings.  He stopped by, probably to share a piece of information or to be informed, but not for the meetings -- to share information on security and the humanitarian tragedy that was unfolding in the city.  I recall that he was looking to ask for a military intervention.  I believe I mentioned that yesterday.  He came to inform -- or discuss with the army general staff the possibility of cleaning up the city because there were too many corpses on the streets.  And, at that time, he informed that, together with the Red Cross, they were going to undertake that operation.  And he also came to discuss Nyacyonga, with refugees -- from nine to ten, where refugees were expected to arrive.  
Q.	Can you first of all spell Nyacyonga for us?
A.	All right.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's not necessary.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, without -- and I am sorry to interrupt you -- I am really wanting to know, briefly, if you can tell me, how many occasions did the Accused come to army headquarters?  Can you remember, other than "More than once"?   
A.	The "more than once" represents all what I have just said I mean on those four occasions.  But it was informal.  He did not go for an audience; he came to seek information on operations.  
Q.	And after you took up your new position in May, did you see the Accused again from that point in time until you left Kigali?  And, once again, without -- I don't need descriptions of what took place between you two, but at this stage I am just wanting to know on how many occasions you saw him, if at all. 
A.	I did not see him again, Counsel.  
Q.	Thank you.  And without identifying the position that you held, the place that you were based, was that inside or outside the préfecture?  Was it in Kigali city or Kigali rural préfecture? 
A.	I was in Kigali city, to the south of the city -- to the south and to the west -- or southwest.  If you have the map, it was around Mount Kigali in the area where you have Nyakabanda.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, would you agree with me, Witness, that in the period of April to July 1994, there were approximately 100 FAR soldiers who were killed in and around Kigali?  That doesn't count those who were injured.  Those who were killed, there were approximately 100 who were killed; isn't that correct?  
A.	Did you say 100 Rwandan soldiers killed?  Is that what you said?  There were certainly more, Counsel.  Excuse me, not necessarily around where I was stationed, because where I have just pointed out to you was merely a command post, and the soldiers under my command were a bit more dispersed, and to be more specific there was fighting in that area only from June. 
Q.	Well, can you tell the Trial Chamber, according to your information, how many FAR soldiers do you understand were killed in that period, in Kigali itself? 
A.	Well, casualties within the Rwandan army exceeded 500 persons.  And, towards the end, there was suddenly an increase, a speeding up of this, because we were like walled in, and we had these young fighters from Ruhengeri and who were just shot down like sitting pigeons. 
Q.	So, you say in excess?  Is it around 500 or slightly more than 500 in your estimation? 
A.	In Kigali, there were more than 500. 
Q.	Are you able to be any more precise, bearing in mind the position that you held initially?  And, perhaps, if I can ask you to focus on the period that you were in your initial position.  You have told us that the numbers increased towards the end, but would you agree with me that there were, in fact, less than 500 killed during the month of April in and around Kigali?  
A.	Counsel, the casualty figure, that is, the dead and injured, is the normal situation that appears in the situation reports.  That is, the daily reports that unit commanders sent to operation commanders and that are sent by the latter to the chiefs of staff.  In our case, just as I told you, that is the situation of those who are present -- those who are not present, the deserters, the opening of files, or the daily reports of unit commanders.  All this information did not get to the army headquarters.  

You realise that an army -- a unit commander, that is, a platoon commander has to report on his staff strength to the company commander, and the latter to the battalion commander, and all this information has to get to the army headquarters.  But in the situation in which we found ourselves, I must assure you that it's impossible for me to give you the figures.  Conversely, within a unit like mine, by just taking the example of a fight or successive fights, I can tell you just how -- 
Q.	I am sorry to interrupt you.  I was asking about figures that you found out in your position, up until the end of April.  Now, did you not learn of any deaths of FAR soldiers at army headquarters up until the end of April, or you did learn of some, and, if so, are you able to tell the Trial Chamber how many?  
A.	I am sorry, Counsel, I am not able to do so.  Those figures came up to the G1, and the G1 was supposed to make a summary over a month or two.  And I assure you that work was never done.  
Q.	Would you agree with me, Witness, that during the period when there were a few hundred FAR soldiers in and around Kigali, there were perhaps well over 100,000 civilians killed in and around Kigali during that same period?
A.	Counsel, well, I don't see the link.  The figures that are coming to me -- well, I see I am told that the casualty figure in the FAR was over a hundred.  I said it was more than 500.  But, as for civilians, unfortunately, I know that there were many people killed, but I don't have to compare the number of military casualties to that of civilians, unfortunately.  
Q.	Witness, I didn't ask you to.  I simply asked you to -- whether you agreed with me with the figures that I had suggested to you.  

Do you agree with me that in that same period there were well over 100,000 civilians killed in and around Kigali? 
A.	Well, there, again, I cannot venture into any figures.  But nobody counted the dead.  Nobody counted them.  But the observation is that, unfortunately, for soldiers, one can always say a certain battalion lost a certain number of people; but for the civilians, I deplore the fact that many, many of them were killed, but I can't give you a figure.  Maybe the Red Cross or the préfecture authorities can venture into such figures, but the position I held does not allow me to make any such estimates for Kigali or its environs.  
Q.	Are you aware, and do you accept, that the majority of the civilians who were killed in Kigali were of the Tutsi ethnic group?  
A.	I do agree, Counsel. 
Q.	Do you agree with me that those Tutsi civilians were being killed by those who were targeting them on the basis of their ethnicity? 
A.	For the bulk of them, I believe it was on the basis of their ethnic belonging. 
Q.	Do you accept, Witness, that there was a genocide of the Tutsi in Rwanda in 1994, and, in particular, in Kigali? 
A.	I would not venture into a description or the outcome of what happened.  But the truth is that, by some confusion or misinterpretation, and by "confusion" I mean of soldiers or the RPF movements that recruited on Tutsi basis or had Tutsi demands -- and, so, in such confusion, people attacked an ethnic group.  And I do agree that the Tutsi ethnic group suffered and had victims, some of whom were targeted on the basis of their ethnic belonging.  But if you use that word "genocide", I am not the one who used it.  Certainly, the UN Security Council and the Chamber have done so; you are here for that.  But it is not up to me to say that that description, which is rather technical, is within my jurisdiction to define it. 
Q.	But do you accept that the targeting of the Tutsis within Kigali in April to July 1994 was carried out by FAR soldiers, gendarmes, communal police and civilians? 
A.	The massacre of Tutsis in Kigali and throughout Rwanda was done by people who were Hutu in the majority; but there were civilians, soldiers, gendarmes also, both military corps.  But in no case did (sic) those policemen or the gendarmes were sent by their institutions.  I am saying that a soldier who is -- has deserted when he kills can be considered representative of either the national army or the national gendarmerie or the communal police force. 
Q.	Thank you.  Would you agree with me that there was a massive scale of killings at roadblocks and elsewhere in Kigali as from the 7th of April? 
A.	Most of the killing was committed in the neighbourhoods, and the roadblocks, to my view, were set up by the people manning them to prevent people from going -- to filter them through.  But it wasn't at the roadblocks that people were killed.  They were killed, either at home or in their neighbourhoods, and occasionally at the roadblocks.  
Q.	Now, on the 7th of April, if we can focus on that day a little bit.  You travelled to Kanombe that morning, didn't you? 
A.	That is correct, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	And so we don't identify you, you were taking someone to look at one of the bodies of those persons who had been killed in the plane crash; that's correct, isn't it?  
A.	To be quite precise, someone who was to see a corpse or the corpses of her husband.  Someone had to go there in the context of someone who had suffered a loss in the crash. 
Q.	And as part of your journey, you went past the Kanombe military camp, didn't you? 
A.	That is correct; next to Kanombe camp. 
Q.	Yes.  And what time did you pass there on the way to look at the bodies; and secondly, if you can answer, simply the time that you passed back on your way into town? 
A.	About 9:30 I passed Kanombe camp, and I returned to town at about 20 to 11 or 11 o'clock, all a.m.  
Q.	And as you were travelling both there and back did you hear shooting in the neighbourhood? 
A.	Not at the time -- in Kigali there already was firing, shooting in the neighbourhoods, contrary to the impression I had in the morning.  And in the vicinity of Kanombe I didn't hear any specific firing or explosions that drew my -- not that drew my attention, at any rate. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I didn't understand that answer.  Did you hear any shooting around 9:30, yes or no?  
THE WITNESS:
When I went to Kanombe, I heard firing in the neighbourhoods in Kigali. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
When you passed by 10:40 or 11:00, did you hear any shooting?  
THE WITNESS:
Similarly, I heard fighting -- firing in the neighbourhoods.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	When you say "neighbourhoods", Kanombe?  
A.	No, in the neighbourhoods of Kigali.  In the first part of my answer I said that in Kanombe I did not have any specific -- my attention drawn specifically to any detonations.  But before coming to the presidential residence in Kigali, at that crossroads, my attention wasn't drawn, in particular, between the entrance to the airport and Kanombe. 
Q.	Did you see in Kanombe at 9:30 or 10:40 soldiers who were going around the streets and into people's houses and killing Tutsi? 
A.	I saw soldiers at the crossroad.  There is a crossroad just in front of the church at Kanombe camp, on the right, and then there is a small shopping centre.  At the crossroads there were some soldiers, but I didn't leave the tarmacked road, I went to a specific residence where I was due to go.  
Q.	Well, you have told, in answer to a question from Her Honour yesterday, that you subsequently heard of FAR soldiers who took part in killings on the 7th of April.  Did you hear that the paracommando unit at Kanombe had been out into the local area and had targeted Tutsis on the morning of the 7th of April?  Did that information get to you at headquarters? 
A.	There was no report of that type to headquarters, HQ, on the morning of the 7th of April. 
Q.	At any point at headquarters, after the 7th of April, did you get such a report? 
A.	I think I answered that yesterday when I answered Her Honour that after the 7th of April HQ learned that soldiers were hiding among the gangs -- gangs of killers, to go and -- and perhaps the paracommandos from Kanombe were not an exception -- a particular exception.  
Q.	Witness, you are an intelligent man, and, with respect, that does not answer my question.  

In respect of the paracommando unit, did you receive a complaint at any stage that you were at headquarters that on the 7th -- morning of the 7th of April they were out in the area targeting Tutsi, yes or no? 
A.	I will answer no for the simple reason that that report should be made by the sectoral commander, or the camp commander, and such a report never came specifying that soldiers from the paracommando battalion, named specifically, had participated in massacres in the small trading centre.  
Q.	Also on the 7th of April, before the RPF left their barracks, will you agree with me that soldiers from the Presidential Guard in Kimihurura left their barracks and went out and specifically targeted politicians in that area? 
A.	What I heard, learned on the 8th, was that opponents, political opponents had been assassinated, killed in their homes in Kimihurura.  If you want to extrapolate and mention the Presidential Guard, there is no real difficulty because the Presidential Guard was there.  But, as regards a report, as such, of the RPF exiting their barracks -- I am sorry I am losing my thread -- my train of thought.  Could you repeat, please?  
Q.	Do you, first of all, accept that soldiers from the Presidential Guard battalion at Kimihurura left their barracks on the morning of the 7th of April and they went out and targeted and killed a number of civilians who were politicians, including the prime minister?  
A.	Well, now, the prime minister was living in Kigali not in Kimihurura.  And, as to the first part of the question, political opponents were killed in Kimihurura, and unfortunately there was no investigation.  It could be that it was soldiers from the Presidential Guard.  There was no enquiry -- investigation.  At 15 -- sorry, at 3 p.m., but I can confirm that in the morning the Presidential Guard had already exited at night to defend the camp.  However, under the orders of the chief of staff, and with the cooperation of General Dallaire, there should be no excessive response, the Presidential Guard returned to their camp.  They abandoned their lines of defence that they had taken up during the night and went back into the barracks during the day.  But as regards the massacres or the killing of the politicians, there was no investigation or enquiry, but I would not rule out the possibility that it was soldiers from the Presidential Guard.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Try to be brief, Mr. Witness.  Will you make an attempt, please?  
THE WITNESS:
I will try to do so, Mr. President. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	So there was no report to headquarters in respect of those killings at any stage after the 7th of April to headquarters, correct?  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And also on the morning of the 7th of April, before the RPF left their barracks at 3:00 in the afternoon, FAR soldiers were involved in the murder of ten Belgian soldiers at Camp Kigali at a place approximately 2- to 300 metres from where you were having your meeting; isn't that correct? 
A.	That is correct, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	And no soldiers were ever brought to account or found to have been responsible for those killings, were they, by the FAR in 1994? 
A.	As far as I know, no disciplinary measures -- there was no sanctioning of those who were responsible.  G1 and the commander of Camp Kigali who would normally undertake the necessary investigations, and they were never completed within three months following those killings. 
Q.	Do you agree with me, Witness, that the battlefront, if you want to use that term, was almost stable in Kigali from the 17th of April until the city was evacuated in early July 1994? 
A.	I do not agree at all.  
Q.	And because, you would agree with me, wouldn't you, if the battlefront -- to use that term -- had been stable from mid-April until July, and assuming, for the moment, that the roadblocks or some persons on them were out of control and not, in fact, doing what the army and the authorities wanted, you would agree with me there would be no good reason why such roadblocks could not have been taken down or taken out during that period? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, the roadblocks and the massacres of civilians were a difficulty for the war effort by the RGF.  And if the battlefront had been stable, as requested by Major General Gatsinzi, who was the interim commander, and the wishes of General Dallaire, whether in good faith or not, had the battlefront been stable, I think that the RGF could have taken care of those armed gangs.  And the fact that there was killing, the chaos that was created, resulted in a logic of defeat, which only -- and then it only took three months for the country to fall.  
Q.	Thank you for that answer.  You told us yesterday that you were listening on Radio RTLM on the evening of 6th of April when you heard of the death of President Habyarimana.  Was that your radio station of choice? 
A.	It wasn't in the evening, Mr. Prosecutor, it was in the early morning.  I think I said when I was woken by the firing of rockets and machine-guns -- heavy machine-guns. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness said.  
THE WITNESS:
RTLM was not my preferred radio station.  I listened to it, I turned it on -- switched it on because it had music, and the young servant boy had it, and he was listening.  I was not audacious (sic) to the point of not going to sleep, but he listened to all the messages, and the room was open to all the elements and I could hear them talking about it -- to the events.  Far from being my preferred radio station, but it was giving news.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Did you continue to listen to that or any other radio station from 7th April to early July?   
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, no.  
Q.	Now, from what you have told the Trial Chamber, the military headquarters were aware by the end of March 1994 that the RPF was well armed, correct?  
A.	That is correct, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	And well trained? 
A.	In any case, well prepared.  They had not suspended their training or preparations for war in the period after the ceasefire or the Peace Accords. 
Q.	Now, I think you told the Trial Chamber earlier this morning, looking at P. 24, which was a letter sent from the chief of staff regarding a meeting held with others, including the Accused, that they were really organising an early warning system.  That's the words you used, isn't it?  
A.	A warning system is by definition before the fact.  It's just that those cells should at least alert to infiltrations or a grouping of RPF combatants in one or another neighbourhood or district.  
Q.	In paragraph 10 of that letter, there is reference to the bourgmestres -- a suggestion that the bourgmestres instruct the population in traditional weapons, swords, spears, machetes, bows and arrows handling.  How would training in the use of a machete, Witness, assist in either an early warning system or in fighting a well-trained and armed RPF? 
A.	Could I have confirmation of paragraph 10, please?  
Q.	That's correct.  Do you have it in front of you?  
MR. MOSES:
I am sorry, I thought the witness did.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do we have a copy for the witness, paragraph 10 of P --  
MR. MOSES: 
Twenty-four

While that's -- can I continue, Your Honour, while it's -- oh.
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Do you see that now, Witness? 
A.	I am there.  
Q.	You will agree with me, machetes would be -- and machete training would be very effective training to be used in the killing of unarmed civilians, it wouldn't be particularly useful in an early warning system or fighting a well-armed and trained RPF soldier, would it?  
A.	That is correct, Mr. Prosecutor.  It's not the machetes -- with machetes that you can resist heavy machine-gun 1200 metres from the targets.  But the high command of the army recognised its deficiency in lack of armament.  They should have at least had rifles, but the chief of staff realised they didn't have them.  So not having proper armament, they advised to use what's left; couldn't tell them to run away.  So, in view of that, what the RPF did in the zones it occupied before and even afterwards, to have a machete might be reassurance, to have a spear would be reassurance.  There weren't enough guns for all the people to be enrolled in those cells, and so the chief of staff recommended they resort to something else.  But what is true is that this provision which, fortunately, or unfortunately, did not take place -- was in any case derisory.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Remember brevity, Mr. Witness.  

Here comes the next question.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Were you involved in the unofficial distribution of weapons and ammunition from within the Rwandan army; yes or no?  
A.	The answer would be no, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	If weapons had been provided to the ministry of defence, the préfectoral office, or anywhere else, that were from military camps throughout Kigali, you would not know about that would you, because you weren't, for that first month or so out in the field?  
A.	No, for the first month I was at my first post, which was rather at the office.  But from -- if arms came from a military camp to the ministry of defence, it's sure that I wouldn't have been informed. 
Q.	And we have had heard, in fact, from a defence witness, Witness, that he said some weapons were distributed from Camp Kigali into the sectors, and I am referring to Witness AIA.  So that sort of thing could happen, couldn't it, without you being aware of it?  
A.	That could have happened without me knowing about it.  But the difference is that since the truce of March 1993 there was no fighting, and the administrative and logistic approach was that weapons held by units or camps are transferred to the base through a transfer slip.  So there is no reason that a march -- arms should be stored in a store.  And since Camp Kigali has a reconnaissance battalion there was no reason that Camp Kigali should distribute weapons to the exterior when it needed such arms.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. MOSES:
I am wondering if the witness could briefly be shown P. 57 -- 77, I am sorry, which is the booklet of photographs.  I am happy for my copy to be given -- shown to the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe we could find them.  Have you, already, the photograph on the top available for witness?  
MR. MOSES: 
It's really an impression in the first one.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	If you look at the top photograph, Witness, will you agree with me that the group of people there seem to be particularly well armed? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And we have heard that photograph was taken in Kigali, perhaps in Muhima, in mid-May 1994.  My question to you is:  There didn't seem to be too much of a shortage of weapons and ammunition, so as far as the persons who were manning the roadblocks are concerned; would you agree with that?  
A.	And I would gladly add that they let themselves be photographed.  
Q.	And, so, if there was such a shortage of arms for the army, it wouldn't have been difficult, would it, to have collected such weapons off these people who were using their arms and bullets to shoot innocent civilians? 
A.	I presume, Counsel, that these photos were taken, as you say, after 7 April and that all our interventions today are to the effect that the armed gangs were not disarmed, because from within the FAR, the FAR, as an institution and as a military organisation, had a task, and those in its rear were actually hurting its effort, and they could not go to collect those weapons because they were fighting against another enemy.  And if I tell you that it was worse than the RPF that was firing in front of us, because these people were harming -- were hurting our operations, they were killing the population, but they were destroying the defence structure and pushing it to defeat.  It was the resources that were required to dismantle these people.  Precisely I told you that these people got together here for a photo because they were at a roadblock, otherwise they would be a lot more armed than the FAR structures.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The photograph just referred to was K0376701.  

Have we finished with the photograph?  
MR. MOSES: 
Yes, thank you, sir.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	There was an army unit, wasn't there, established to deal with those who were looting in Kigali, correct?  
A.	Actually, it was not a unit, but a detachment of the military police of Camp Kigali, just a detachment, because the bulk of the military police was at Kami and did not intervene to maintain law and order and discipline.  So that detachment was assigned to combat looting that took hold of the commercial centre and Kigali plateau neighbourhood.  
Q.	And, in fact, I think they shot at a couple of looters, didn't they, and they managed by doing that to stop or seriously reduce the amount of looting.  Isn't that correct?  
A.	At about nine -- around 9 April they tried to check the looting or to fight the looters, but they did not carry their effort to the end.  The result was really derisory.  There was a detachment that was in charge of discipline in Camp Kigali.  It was not a major unit to combat looting or indisciplined soldiers, but there was an operation to combat looting in those residential neighbourhoods, notably in the Kigali commercial centre.  
Q.	All right.  Moving onto civil defence, Witness, you told us you didn't listen to the radio after the 7th of April, is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.  I did not move about with the radio set -- or did not sit down somewhere to listen to the radio.  But, from time to time, I would hear the radio.  It is possible, but I am not saying that in three months I did not have occasion to listen to a radio.  But, generally speaking, my duty was not to listen to the radio.

1015H
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Well, did you, on the 22nd of April, hear on Radio Rwanda the Accused introducing a FAR officer by the name of Esdras Mushimiyamana, M-U-S-H-I-M-I-Y-A-M-A-N-A, who was a second lieutenant?  
A.	No, Counsel. 
Q.	And that second lieutenant said on the radio how on the 22nd of April, how "we will be working together to see how we can improve on the civil defence system in the course of meetings that I will be having with you."  You didn't hear that?  
A.	No, Counsel. 
Q.	And if there was no civil defence, as you have told the Trial Chamber, there equally would have been no reason for the Accused to go on the radio on the 22nd of April, the 10th of May, that's Prosecution Exhibit 56; the 18th of June, Prosecution Exhibit 62; and again on the 18th of June, Prosecution Exhibit 63; where the Accused spoke about civil defence system meetings he had held with youth, the military, and civilian authorities?  You didn't hear any of those speeches by the Accused on the radio?  
A.	No, Counsel. 
Q.	The truth of the matter, isn't it, Witness, that the FAR were working together with the youth, militia of the MRND and CDR parties, and others.  They were working together during the course of the events from April to July 1994.  That's correct, isn't it?  
A.	To my knowledge, no.  Well, it was even dangerous to have armed civilians, as you seem to imply, working with the combat units, professional persons trained for that purpose.  It was more dangerous to work with them than to stay alone.  

Now, a measure that would have been taken in that direction would have put them within the troops.  And within my unit, I'd never known that kind of thing.  The truth is that whether they're called gangs, or these gray armies, are behind, in the rear, of the combat troops.  And in a double capacity, they manage the official front line, because they cause disturbances within the country.  They disturb population to make them to flee.  And naturally, they give a pretext, military and pretext, to the RPF.  

So if there had been unofficial troops or defence in addition to the professional troops, we would have known.  And I believe that no unit commander would have been comfortable with troops who may have a weapon -- or who may know how to shoot, but who may not have been trained with his own troops.  
Q.	Witness, do you know a person who, I believe, may have been a commander, Laurent, L-A-U-R-E-N-T, Twagirayezu, T-W-A-G-I-R-A-Y-E-Z-U? 
A.	That name does not ring a bell with me.  At any rate, Twagirayezu was a former commander.  I do know one, but I do not know about the first name, Laurent.  I do know a former commander known as Twagirayezu, but who was no longer part of the army for some time. 
MR. MOSES:
I'd ask that the witness be shown one of the documents which had been handed out, Your Honours.  It's a radio broadcast.  
BY MR. MOSES:  
Q.	Now, Witness, the radio broadcast that's been given to you, the transcript is in three languages.  The top is in Kinyarwandan, and it goes through to page 29.  I don't know if you would be more comfortable reading the Kinyarwandan or the French.  The French begins immediately after that.
MR. MOSES:  
And I can certainly point to you the part that I want to comment on in the French, and also in the English, Your Honours.  I'm looking at page 2 of the English.  It's K0298885, about two-thirds of the way down.  
BY MR. MOSES:  
Q.	And in the French, Witness, I'm looking at the bottom of page 2.  In the French version, it's K0295996, going onto the following page.  
A.	I am there.  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours?  The -- there is an introduction of Mr. Twagirayezu on the radio.  And he introduces himself, talks about the war breaking out, and then he says -- and it's in the French, the fifth line starting "Nous nous sommes," and in the English "We realised".  

It says, "We realised that soldiers could not prosecute this war by themselves without the help of live forces of the country, which include the youths.  The idea of civil defence originated from there.  We, therefore, brought together reservists of all descriptions, soldiers, lance corporals, non-commissioned officers, and some officers we were able to find.  We got the youth from Nyakabanda, Nyamirambo, and Biryogo secteurs, and we started giving them military training in what we called the centre d'instruction of Nyamirambo.  In reality, we think that we have just trained a battalion of about 700 persons."

And the next line, first part which is relevant:  "Currently, some of them are part of the Huye battalion."  

Now, -- I will be able to give you a -- point to you later -- if my friends want me, I can do it now -- that this radio broadcast was at some point after the 7th of June, for reasons which I will show later.  But do you agree with me, Witness, that there was, in fact, a civil defence system; there were some 700 youths trained at Nyamirambo stadium as part of that; and, in fact, some of them went to the Huye battalion?  Do you agree with those propositions?  
A.	I do not agree with the propositions.  Actually, you've mentioned a date.  I hope -- I hope what you're saying is true.  I believe we are -- in June -- we're talking about June.  And what I know is that in June...(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover) young fighters, who came to reinforce the positions of the battalion at Mount Kigali, where there was a raid.  That is, at Mount Rebero, Kimisange -- Kimisange, K-I-M-I-S-A-N-G-I (sic) -- raiders who had attacked the southeastern flank of Mount Kigali.  (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover)   
Q.	All right.  And looking at page 4 on the French, the very top sentence, and in English it's on page 3, the top two lines of the third paragraph, he goes on to say that, "It was called the first squad, but considering that we trained many persons, some went to the front while others staffed the roadblocks."  

Do you see that?  And were you aware --
A.	As I've told you, (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover).  Whether it was the first squad or second squad or the mosque, as is mentioned below, I don't know.  
Q.	Were you aware that some of those persons who were -- the young people who were trained, were sent to roadblocks?  Yes or no?  
A.	I did not know about that, because the roadblocks go back to 7 April.  And given the dates, this training could be the one mentioned this morning with Major Bivamvagara, but I am not really sure.  
Q.	That major who you've just referred to, he, in fact, had an office and was based at PVK, wasn't he?  Or you weren't aware of that?  
A.	I know nothing about it, and I'm learning it from you that the training took place at the stadium. 
Q.	Now, briefly before we end with this document, that Mr. Twagirayezu introduced another person who was a sergeant by the name of Rwamparage, spelt R-W-A-M-P-A-R-A-G-E.  And just so that you know I wasn't misleading you, if you look on page 5, at the top of the last paragraph, starting "Le 1er juin," and in English it's on the fourth page, the third paragraph.  In that paragraph, he's talking about events on the 1st of June.  And in the following paragraph, and it's on the following page in the French, and the next paragraph down, he's talking about events on the 6th and 7th, after the 1st of June.  So, sometime after the 7th of June.  

The last bit that I want to refer you to, in respect of that transcript in front of you, is on page 7 in the French.  It's in the middle of the second paragraph.  It's the same speaker continuing, namely, Sergeant Rwamparage.  And the bit I'm going to focus on is the sentence which commences  "II est parti".  That's four lines down.  In the English it's on page 5, and in the second paragraph, and perhaps the fifth or sixth line down, where he is talking about an event and some fighting.  He says, "A person left, and about one hour later he came back with a company of soldiers in reinforcement, fighting continued, the company arrived with some youths of the Interahamwe and the Impuzamugambi from Simbizi.  

Do you see that there, Witness?  
A.	I have it, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	You'd agree with me that that would indicate that the army were, at least on that occasion, working together with the Interahamwe and the youth militia of the CDR party?  That's what it indicates, doesn't it?  
A.	From reading what I see here, yes.  But as a description of the battalion, that is not true.  
Q.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover)
A.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover)	
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
There is a need to redact from 10:26:00 where the witness started responding to questions within this sequence.  That commences with the words, "I do not agree with the propositions."  And then follows an exchange over a few paragraphs.  It contains a lot of non-sensitive information, but there are a few formulations that should be redacted.  And I'm now simply saying that any reference to who received, or who learned about developments, shall be deleted.  And the Bench will cooperate with the court reporters so that we only delete what is absolutely essential.  

Let's proceed. 
MR. MOSES: 
I was there, Your Honour.  I'm just trying to locate my list of questions, which I think I'm almost at.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Just briefly, Witness, on the 17th of June, did you personally go to Sainte Famille/Saint Paul area in the morning following the RPF having been there the night before? 
A.	No, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Finally, Witness, in respect of the position of the Accused, who was a -- you'll agree, a full colonel in the Rwandan army, as of the morning of the 7th of April, and the death of General Nsabimana and the president, how many generals were left alive in Rwanda at that point in time?  
A.	Only one, Ndindiliyimana. 
Q.	So you'll agree with me that there was only one more senior military officer in the country at that point in time to the Accused, who was a colonel? 
A.	There were many other superior officers, superior in rank to Renzaho, because the ranking is years of service, in conjunction with a system of promotion, which resulted from the order in which they had been promoted from the military school.  I think he wasn't even in third, fourth or fifth rank.  There were other officers with more years of service, even if they had the same rank. 
Q.	Do you agree with me, Witness, that the Rwandan law regarding armed forces says that a superior has not only the right, but the duty, to enforce compliance with the general rules governing discipline by all soldiers below him in order of hierarchy, even if the soldiers are not under his operational authority?  Do you agree with me that's what the law states?  
A.	The right and duty to take note and make a report concerning the person showing lack of discipline. 
Q.	So you don't agree that it says -- that the law states that a superior officer has the right and duty to enforce compliance?  You don't agree with that, that's what the law was in 1994? 
A.	The nuance in the word as "assured", to ensure -- but an officer, any soldier has the right and duty to take note, and to accuse, or to name, the soldier of a lesser rank who is showing lack of discipline or doing anything against the rules and regulations and laws.  He has to report to those who have the power to sanction, punish. 
MR. MOSES: 
That's the end of my cross-examination.  Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  This document you used, is that part of your transcript folder or -- 
MR. MOSES: 
It is not, and so I'd be seeking Your Honours to introduce that. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We got one comprehensive document. 
MR. MOSES: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And one document running from page 1 to 5 in the French, and 1 to 4 in the English.  Did you use only one of them?  
MR. MOSES: 
I only used one of them because he recognised the name of the persons.  And it was only if he did not that I would have done that, used that other one. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So you only want exhibited the voluminous document starting with K0142324?  
MR. MOSES: 
That's correct.  And as I say, it's in Kinyarwandan, French and English.  And -- yes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mrs. Ben Salimo, next Prosecution exhibit number, please?  
MS. BEN SALIMO:  
It's P. 113, in the three versions, A, B, C. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  Kinyarwanda, French and English in that sequence.
(Exhibit No. P. 113A, P. 113B, and P. 113C admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any re-examination?  

MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President, a very brief examination.  
RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, I should like, with you, to revisit the document shown to you by the Prosecutor in which Mr. Renzaho was introducing Esdras Mushimiyamana.  He did not give you the totality of the Renzaho speech, but there is a paragraph I should like to read to you, and ask you how you interpret it.  
MR. NEKUIE:
On page K0246838, the first document brought by the Prosecutor and shown to the witness.  K0246838.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	I should like, Mr. Witness -- 
MR. NEKUIE:
I don't know if the Bench has the document before them.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreters don't. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just help us exactly with which document you are referring to now.  You're not referring to the bundle we just tendered as P. 113, I take it.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
No.  The first document the Prosecutor brought containing a message from Mr. Renzaho to the population introducing Esdras Mushimiyamana, sub lieutenant to the population.  It was the first document.  And you do have it, sir.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But just give us the reference, Mr. Moses.  Was it P. 11, 24 or 25?  
MR. MOSES: 
It is P. 54, it's under tab 8.  I would also comment, Your Honour, that the -- having put -- the witness said he hadn't heard -- I won't object at this juncture. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  So the reference made now is to P. 54.  All right.  And having heard the answer, that's why you didn't proceed with that document.  You are now coming back to that document and want to go into it, Mr. Nekuie.  What is your question?  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, I will read to you the paragraph preceding Mr. Renzaho's introduction, the second paragraph in the French version, and I would like to ask you to comment upon it.  
The paragraph -- the end of the paragraph begins as follows:  "We are beginning to note these criminal acts in some secteurs where young people join unscrupulous soldiers to aggress members of the population by obtaining money from them and looting their houses.  We must absolutely stop such acts so that the armed forces can resolutely fight the enemy.  Therefore, we need to establish security committees, in some secteurs they've been called crisis committees, and it is up to those committees to take care of organising that."  And then the next paragraph says, "I take this opportunity to introduce to you the officer who has been selected to work with me."  

This was Mr. Renzaho's comment at the presentation of Sub Lieutenant Esdras Mushimiyamana.  If the Prosecutor had read to you what I have just read to you, Witness, how would you have interpreted it? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We can't allow that question.  So do you have another question?  And I think the reasons are clear.  It's speculative, it is something that the witness had not listened to, the document wasn't used by the Prosecution in cross-examination.  These are three of the reasons why we have to move on to the next question.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, the Prosecution attempted to use this document, and they drew consequences from it, even if they didn't tender the document.  They said that Renzaho wanted to set up a system of civil defence.  They described to him that intention.  Of course, I do respect the ruling of the Bench, but I did have to make this comment.  

I have now finished with my re-examination.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Mr. Witness, it follows from your testimony, doesn't it, that soon after the commencement of events in 1994, some soldiers of the Rwandan army were seen among so-called armed gangs.  
THE WITNESS:
The information that reached the chief of staff confirms that, but it was only after the 8th.  But that wasn't long, in any case, because it's only one day.  
JUDGE EGOROV: 
But what was the status of those soldiers?  Were they deserters, or who were they?  
THE WITNESS:
The situation in the army was that there was some soldiers who lived in neighbourhoods who, at the time when there was -- from the 6th to the 7th, coming after the assassination, a communiqué inviting the people to stay at home.  So the soldiers did not exit in the morning for the simple reason that they weren't thinking that the war was going to start.  In any case, they were concerned with security.  They stayed with their -- in there (unintelligible) so as not to fill up the roads to the camps.  

Because there was no alerts, there was no call for them to go back to barracks.  That's the first reason why the soldiers stayed in the neighbourhoods.  And it is not -- we cannot -- cannot exclude that they might have associated themselves with evil-doers in the neighbourhoods, in some shooting and some throwing of grenades.  They were also soldiers who took advantage of the chaos that ensued on the day of the 7th, the explosions, the beginning of the looting, the killing.  Soldiers who were not being confined to barracks or to camp, because there was no alert, no mobilisation, would come out of the camps and leave.  And then there's abandonment of position.  

That -- that category of soldiers, and others that I said in the document which you admitted yesterday, there were others who, speaking of -- or concerned for their loved one's safety, left Kigali with those loved ones, without permission, to return to their home hills hoping to find life a bit calmer there.  And they did not return to fight.  And all those who were not encarded by the unit commanders or the chief of staff. 
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Should I take it that there were some soldiers who could be considered as deserters? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please answer briefly, now, Mr. Witness.  It's really necessary.  We do not need these elaborations.  You see, now Judge Egorov has to more or less ask the question again.  So what is the answer?  
THE WITNESS:
There were deserters in the army. 
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Thank you.  And in your statement, written statement, you gave to the Defence in July of this year, you mentioned that among other members of high command of the Rwandan army, the minister of defence was out of the country on the 6th of April 1994.  Is it correct?  
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.  And my statement is dated in May -- May 2007.  Sorry. 
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Could you please briefly explain to us the reasons why he -- I mean, the minister of defence, turned out to be abroad on that particular date?  
THE WITNESS:
He was in Cameroon attending a conference planned well in advance.  I don't remember exactly which international organisation organised the conference, but he was in Cameroon, and he left on the 4th or 5th.  I think it was the 5th of April.  
JUDGE EGOROV: 
(Microphones overlapping)
THE WITNESS:
I think it was on the 8th or the 9th. 
JUDGE EGOROV: 
What was the reason of the delay?  
THE WITNESS:
I imagine it was, rather, for technical reasons.  The time to be informed and to get -- catch a plane.  There was no regular flights.  In any case, it wasn't an easy route.  He had to go through other capitals.  And he didn't land in Kigali, in any case.  So it's for technical reasons; the time taken for the information to get there, and for transportation. 
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the sentence which we lost because of overlapping microphones when Judge Egorov spoke, was:  "And when did he return to the country?"

Thank you.  That was the end of your testimony, Mr. Witness.  We would like to thank you very much for having come the long way to Arusha to testify, and wish you a very safe journey home.  Thank you.  

And should you wish to meet with the Accused, the witness protection unit will look into any such request and make sure that it is implemented.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you very much, indeed, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will, then, adjourn to 11:30, and begin with the next witness.  

Will that be in open or closed session, Defence?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
We will probably begin in closed session, and then move in to open session, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the duration of the closed session will be approximately -- 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Fifteen minutes or so, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  So we will open again at around 11:45.  The Court is adjourned.  
(Witness excused)
(Court recessed from 1057H to 1130H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, Mr. Witness.  

THE WITNESS:
Good morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You will be referred to as Witness PER in these proceedings.  You have to tell the truth, and the registry will now take your solemn declaration.  
(Declaration made by Witness PER in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You have a document in front of you there, Mr. Witness, with your signature, isn't that so?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is the case. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So the information in this document is correct?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, the data is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Matemanga. 
MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 80. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. 80 admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence, you wanted closed session for about 15 minutes, isn't that so?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Such is the case. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will move into closed session.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 27 to 30] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness PER, we are now in open session to continue your examination-in-chief.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	What exactly can you tell us were your activities, both at Saint Paul and at Holy Family?  
A.	The humanitarian activities that I was involved in at Saint Paul and Holy Family consisted of receiving the refugees, people who came from all quarters, who were around Sainte Famille and Saint Paul -- or, Holy Family and Saint Paul.  When they arrived -- first of all, we showed them a place to stay.  There were places.  

Saint Paul centre, I should like to clarify, was a Catholic centre which was used for conferences and meetings.  It was, in brief, a pastoral centre.  The internal structure was different from that of the structure at Holy Family.  When people came, we'd give them shelter, family by family.  We would not separate the families.  Such and such a place, according to the surface area, would harbour so many families. 

But at Holy Family, it was the church that was there.  There was the internal courtyard, surrounded by the houses, premises, of the presbytery.  And that's where the people stayed.  The structure was different.  And at Sainte Famille -- at Holy Family, people also went in to various places, family by family.  It was forbidden to break up families when they arrived as a family, of course.  

And, then, when there was injured or wounded people, as there were, we tried to contact the Red Cross, who played a major role in everything we did.  And they'd come either to evacuate the injured, the sick, or give them medicine.  And it was in that atmosphere that we went on welcoming refugees day after day -- receiving refugees day after day. 
Q.	Thank you for that clarification, Witness.  In the context of those activities, did you benefit from assistance from Kigali préfecture, the authorities at Kigali préfecture?  
A.	In our activities we -- as time passed, the situation became more and more alarming.  And among the authorities we received at Holy Family and Saint Paul, we came to cooperate with Mr. Simpunga, who was sub prefect at PVK in charge of social affairs.  It was he to whom we would turn, it's he who would come to us, it was he who worked with us, cooperated with us.  He helped us in several fields, bringing foodstuffs, drawing water, and also for medicine he assisted us. 
Q.	As of what date, if you remember, did you begin going to Holy Family parish for those activities?  
A.	To be quite precise, it was on the 10th of April.  Because at Saint Paul's, I told you that the way we received refugees was not organised as it was at Holy Family.  The number of refugees at Saint Paul was rather limited in view of the narrow premises, small premises.  At Holy Family, there was a constant movement, it was full up inside, outside, anybody could come.  There were more than 18,000 refugees.  It is after the 10th when I saw that Munyeshyaka was overburdened, he mentioned it to me himself.  I went to give him assistance.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you -- did you -- did you refer to the sub-prefect of PVK in the last answer, Mr. Witness?  Could you repeat the name, please?  
THE WITNESS:
I knew him as Simpunga.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you mention his first name or did you just say Simpunga in your last answer?  
THE WITNESS:
If you're asking me his full name, it was Aloys Simpunga -- Aloysius -- Aloys.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	On your way between Saint Paul and Sainte Famille, Witness, did you come across roadblocks? 
A.	Saint Paul and Sainte Famille were two adjoining localities, but they were separated by a wall.  And on that wall, there was a small door from Saint Paul into Sainte Famille.  So if I were going to Sainte Famille from Saint Paul, I would use that small gate.  And that was the same route that was used by people staying in Saint Paul and Sainte Famille.  It was a private passage for persons living either in Saint Paul or Sainte Famille.  It was not a thoroughfare.  But if I had to go out with the car, I would go round the wall that separated the two localities.  So it is under such a circumstance that one could come across a roadblock of the militias.
(Pages 31 to 32 by Vicki Eastvold)
















1200H 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, when we were preparing your testimony, you prepared a sketch for me.  And with the leave of the Chamber, since we have circulated copies thereof, I would like you to explain that sketch to the Chamber since it has to do with the roadblocks.  And to help you, my question is as follows:  Were there roadblocks that were found in the vicinity of Saint Paul? 
A.	Thank you.  The sketch I prepared for you indicated the roadblocks, and I would explain further if you -- if you so want.  There you see where it is written Saint Paul.  Next to that, there is Sainte Famille.  When you go up on this little road that I have drawn, you see where it is written MC, that is militias or militiamen, that roadblock was found near a stand of the brewing company that was around there and the militiamen were there all the time.  When one went up with the car -- in a car -- and to move into the small road there, which was incomplete, one had to go round the Sainte Famille church.  So where you have MC there was a roadblock manned by the militiamen.  And coming from Saint Paul, when you were moving from Sainte Famille those militiamen would stop you and ask you questions and even threaten you.  That was the first roadblock.  

Can I continue to explain the roadblocks? 
Q.	Yes, the roadblocks that were found in the vicinity of Saint Paul and Sainte Famille, just those essentially, Witness. 
A.	Thank you.  Moving down -- move down to where it is written "Péage toll gate", can you see Péage?  At that point there was another roadblock manned by the militiamen.  Because when you look closely after Saint Paul, going down there is SELA and JOC, all these areas were within the Catholic church area.  Leaving Sainte Famille to JOC, that was within the plot of the Catholic church, precisely, the Kigali archbishopric.  And where you have Péage, the toll gate, there was another roadblock manned by militiamen.  Move down further into the neighbourhood and then leave the major highway you will find secteur Rugenge.  This was a dirt road and untarred road leading to Rugenge secteur.  There you had a roadblock manned by the militiamen of that neighbourhood and it was called Ngahanga roadblock.  I don't know why, but it was also manned by militiamen, who, from what I learnt, wanted to check the forward thrust of the RPF elements who were infiltrating the neighbourhood.  And I will stop there because those are the roadblocks that were in the vicinity of the Sainte Famille parish.  The others were out of the town, towards the exit of the town.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you -- 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Can you please spell the name of that roadblock?  It sounded like Ugaranga.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  Ngahanga is spelt N-G-A-H -- oh, sorry, H-E-N-G-E. Can I take that over, if you don't mind?  Ngahanga, N-G-A-H-A-N-G-A.  I hope that is understood. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, as far as you know, who were these militiamen, because I suppose you were used to seeing them?  
A.	Thank you.  Actually, my personal observation -- because I observed, I saw them and I had occasion to speak to them, these militiamen comprised what I can call thieves, thieves who were adventurous, who took advantage of the situation we were experiencing to try to express their own usefulness, their lives or their own way of taking it out, because amongst them I had never once seen anybody who was an intellectual or anybody who worked in an office anywhere or any person that I knew well or somebody responsible.  Conversely, they were young persons who may not have been employed before, street kids, in short, thieves, as I mentioned.  Thank you.
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, can you tell us if these militiamen were receiving orders from any authority at the time? 
A.	Thank you.  I have told you that I lived in Sainte Famille and in Saint Paul.  I spent some time, some part of my life there, 16 years, therefore some time.  I knew the authorities.  I knew the vicinity and I can tell you that as far as I know, those children depended on one Angeline Mukandituye, who was an inspector or the director of a primary school, Sainte Famille primary school in Kigali.  Nonetheless, apart from that lady and the conseiller of the secteur, no other authority had ever managed or had any links with the militiamen. 
Q.	Witness, at the time did you know the préfet of Kigali city? 
A.	Well, there was no way I could fail not to know him.  As the préfet, I knew him. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the name referred to in the previous answer was Angeline, the last name being at 265 on the revised list dated the 22nd of August 2007.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Could you tell the Chamber, Witness, if you had occasion to see him or if you learnt or heard people saying that he was often at the roadblocks that you mentioned above? 
A.	Please, be specific in your question.  Be specific about the person you are talking about. 
Q.	I am talking about the préfet of the city of Kigali, a person you claim to know very well. 
A.	Yes, sir.  All the time I spent at Saint Paul and at Sainte Famille and even when I went out of these areas, I would like to say that I saw Préfet Renzaho just once for all the time I was in Saint Paul and Sainte Famille; that was on 16th June 1994.  On that day he came to Saint Paul.  He stopped by with UNAMIR.  And among the officials of UNAMIR who were with him there was a Ghanaian general and persons from the Red Cross.  So Préfet Renzaho was with officials of UNAMIR and the Red Cross.  They came and they discussed with Father Celestin Hakizimana, and I don't know the subject of their discussion and they left.  It was on that day that I saw him, only on that day. 
Q.	Witness, were you able to know at that time whether Angeline, whose name you mentioned, and Odette, the conseiller de secteur, were often in contact with the préfet of Kigali city? 
A.	Thank you.  All the time I spent at Saint Paul and at Sainte Famille I had never heard anyone mention the name of Renzaho, especially in connection with Angeline or Odette.  As far as I know, Renzaho had never met Odette and Angeline. 
Q.	Witness, did it happen during your stay in those two places that the militiamen that we discussed attacked any of the two places in which you lived? 
A.	Thank you.  In my presence I would tell you that there were attempts to attack but these attempts were repelled each time the militiamen tried to attack us.  Unfortunately, there were wider ranging attacks or attacks of a bigger magnitude that I experienced.  At Saint Paul there was the RPF attacks and at Sainte Famille there was the attack of the militiamen.  These are the attacks that I personally witnessed and which led to casualties.  Other attacks by militiamen were repelled.  And when you mention attacks that led to casualties, I believe those are attacks that actually led to casualties before me.  Once the militiamen managed to enter Saint Paul once -- I cannot recall the date.  I do apologise for that because we were living through a kind of situation that did not enable one to look at one's watch when the situation arrived.  So we just had to cope with the danger.  So, I do recall the attack on that day, but it did not lead to any casualty within Saint Paul. 

Concerning the attack, the militiamen came and asked for one Rukundo, who owned a driving school known as Apomajerwa, it's a driving school.  The said Rukundo sought refuge at Saint Paul, and at some point the militiamen came in, they were furious, they forcibly opened the gate that was manned by a guard who could not resist and they told us if we do not find Rukundo -- they said they were sent by Angeline -- and the group of militiamen was headed by one Nkeshimana. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You need to break up your answers, Mr. Witness.  First, when was this, maybe not the date, but the month or the part of the month? 
THE WITNESS:
Early May.  Can I move on?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Not yet.  Then the next question was the spelling of the driving school. 
THE WITNESS:
Apomajerwa is spelt A-P-R-O-G-A -- J-E-M-A-G ER W-A.  Is that okay? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, Witness, once more, please, because you changed the spelling in the middle of the word.  Shall we try again?  Okay.  
THE WITNESS:
All right.  A-P-O-M-A-J-E-R-W-A. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  And now the spelling of the leader of the militiamen, it sounded like Nshyimana.  
THE WITNESS:
Nkeshimana and that is spelt N-K-E-S-H-I-M-A-N-A.  Is that okay? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  And the technique in this courtroom is to try to make the answers rather brief and then counsel will ask questions whenever he wants some follow up. 

Now, do you want the witness to continue at this juncture, Mr. Nekuie, or do you want to ask some specific questions in view of what we have heard so far? 
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Mr. President, I will ask more specific questions to make his account more intelligible. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, let us move to Saint Paul pastoral centre and let's talk about the attack that you mentioned a while ago. 

When the militiamen came in and said they were looking for Rukundo, who did they talk to, specifically? 
A.	Thank you.  The militiamen came in furious and they said they didn't want to talk to any other person except for Father Celestin Hakizimana.  So he came to meet them.  They moved away to some distance because they didn't want to talk to any other person.  I was sidelined -- 
Q.	Sorry.  Were you able to hear what they said? 
A.	No, not at all, because I was completely away. 
Q.	Nonetheless, did you see them talking together? 
A.	Yes, I was watching. 
Q.	And for how long did the conversation last? 
A.	Less than 10 minutes. 
Q.	What then was the outcome of their discussion even when you did not hear it?  What happened later? 
A.	Since I was watching their movements very closely with a lot of curiosity.  Later on they went down the stairs leading to the premises where the people were kept.  After some time when they came out, they had Mr. Rukundo with them and some other persons, about four or five of them and they put them in a Hilux Mark vehicle, small trucks, which in our country we call Hilux, then they left.  They never came back. 
Q.	All that was done in the presence of Father Hakizimana? 
A.	I repeat that they went down together and still where I was, I was even waiting for them to show me some sign, maybe to know what they were doing, but they didn't do it.  They went down directly because they didn't even want him to move from where he was standing.  So they went down to go and they came together.  I was there, I saw it.  
MR. MOSES:  
Your Honour, I want to place on the record at this stage that this is not included in the statement provided to the Prosecution and this incident has never been put to any of the Prosecution witnesses, and I want that at least noted on the record at this stage.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that's noted.
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, this incidence -- incident was not notified simply because I did not have knowledge of it on the eve of the testimony of this witness.  I don't know, we mentioned -- we talked about Saint Paul and I told myself that since he was talking about Father Hakizimana and his relations with him, it was not necessary then to mention it this morning to the Prosecution, but if the Chamber thinks that there is reason to notify, then I will just move on. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There is not a formal objection at this stage.  When did you have your preparatory conversation with this witness when this reference to Rukundo first came up? 
MR. NEKUIE:
It was precisely yesterday evening, Mr. President, but it was not the first meeting.  There was yesterday evening the final preparation of this witness that I was informed of that incident. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
An e-mail should have been sent.  

Shall we move on?  What is now your next question, please? 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Now, Witness, to conclude on that incident, did Father Hakizimana explains the reasons why those people went or left in his presence? 
MR. MOSES:  
Well, I am going to formally object now, Your Honour.  There has been no notification of this.  This incident has not been put to any Prosecution witness, and it is unfair to both the Prosecution and anyone else. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I would not let the Chamber rule on that issue.  I withdraw my question and I move on to another area, simply. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Now, the new area.  Thank you. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, can you explain to the Chamber how the militia attacks on Saint Famille parish were repelled? 
A.	It was not easy at all.  It needed courage.  What we did when the militiamen came, they would come in a group and at the risk of our lives, we tried -- we would try to talk to their leader because each group that came had a leader.  Thereafter, asking to know the leader of the group, we would try to talk with him, and it was to the leader that we talked.  We asked them -- we asked him what brought them there.  Then he would say we were harbouring Tutsis, or specifically the term used was Ibyitso or accomplices. 

After listening to their grievances, we would tell them that the person they were looking for -- because they would come with specific names of persons, we would tell them that the person was not there, we'd never taken them in.  Then they would protest and say, if we don't see the person, we will cause havoc.  But most of them when they came, they came to ask for something, but in the face of our resistance, they would tell us, "We cannot live without something".  And often we would realise that they were hungry because foodstuff was scarce in the capital.  So, in return, to make them leave without causing havoc because we didn't know the kind of havoc they would cause -- so to prevent them from shooting on somebody, we proposed to them foodstuffs, money or some other such things, flour, rice, then they would leave while promising us that they would come back.  It was a constant battle. 
Q.	Witness, please, try to be a bit more concise and brief in your answers.  Don't get into the details; just answer briefly so that we can gain time. 
A.	I do promise. 
Q.	When you talk about "we" or "us", who are you referring to, to your own self or to some other persons with whom you talked to these militiamen? 
A.	Thank you.  At Sainte Famille there was **********************************************, that is why I am talking about us.  At Saint Paul there was ********************************.  Thank you. 
Q.	Witness, you mentioned a wide scale attack at the Sainte Famille parish.  Can you recall the date on which that attack took place? 
A.	It was on 18th June 1994 -- 17th June 1994. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Correction from the booth, please.
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Could you briefly explain the circumstances under which the attack took place? 
A.	The origin of the attack was at the Saint Paul national centre the day before, the eve.  In the night of the 16th to the 17th there was an RPF attack on Saint Paul.  In the morning the militiamen came, arrived at Saint Paul's and they found that the RPF had already left with the people that they had freed, or let's say, the people they had taken from Saint Paul and enraged as they looted the whole centre, they wrecked that place and then they withdrew. 

Sometime later they went to vent their wrath, vent their wrath, if I might express myself thus, on the people who were at the Holy Family parish.  

May I continue?  
Q.	We will continue, Witness, but I should like some clarification, a few small clarifications.  Where were you when the militiamen arrived at Saint Paul and at what time did they arrive, if you recollect? 
A.	I was in the kitchen at Saint Paul, the priests' kitchen, and next door there was a storeroom, that is where I was.  In the morning at about 6 a.m., I exited to see what was happening, what was going on at Saint Paul's.  I opened the small gate, I spoke of before, and then I saw the militiamen who were scurrying around, some were opening the containers we used as we saw, each one was carrying off what he could lay his hands on.  They were really enraged.  They were mad with rage.  I am using the term on purpose.  They were excoriating the RPF and all the people who were at Saint Paul's. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have answered the question "Where were you?"  Here comes the next question by Judge Egorov. 
JUDGE EGOROV:
Mr. Witness, this is a matter of clarification.  You mentioned attack made by RPF, what do you mean?  Did they kill anybody and were there some victims and so on? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, there were victims.  In that attack during the night when everybody was running around, lost and confused, the RPF succeeded in liberating -- because they had come to liberate the Tutsis who were at Saint Paul's, and amongst those Tutsis there were some victims.  And in the course of the exchange of fire the two gendarmes who were at Saint Paul -- because we had two gendarmes for our security, died in exchange of fire.  Some Hutu were there, the two gendarmes were dead.  Thank you.
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	So, Witness, you were at Saint Paul.  Did you stay there watching the militiamen loot or did you leave the premises when you saw them? 
A.	In view of the situation obtaining, I could not even have stayed there one minute because if I had stayed, I am sure I would have been lynched by the militiamen.  I immediately went to the Holy Family and that is where the militiamen found me, that's where I was.  I fled from Saint Paul and I went next door to Holy Family next to -- next door to Munyeshyaka. 
Q.	When you say that's where the militiamen found you, do you mean that you left and they saw you leaving and they followed you?  
A.	No, it's because if I said they found me when I left Saint Paul -- I left them there.  I fled to Holy Family.  They came there, they didn't even see me.  I couldn't say it was I they were chasing. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It's not very clear.  I am sorry. 

THE WITNESS:
I left Saint Paul's because I thought I would be in security, I would be quiet at Sainte Famille, but perhaps that was their plan.  They reacted differently.  They found me where I had gone to seek refuge. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	What time would you say they arrived at Holy Family, Witness? 
A.	I can't give you a precise time because for us a wristwatch had no value in everything we were doing.  When they came to Holy Family, it was about 9 a.m.  It was about 9:00. 
Q.	Who -- how many were they, approximately, if you have any idea and who seemed to be leaving them, if you saw them coming? 
A.	When they came to Holy Family they were numerous.  I did not have the time to count them because the way in which they entered the Sainte Famille, a human being who had seen what happened at Saint Paul couldn't count them.  They entered as a group, a large group.  When I saw them coming as everyone, everyone just sought a way of disappearing.  I don't know the exact number. 
Q.	What was Father Munyeshyaka's reaction, response to this arrival of the militiamen? 
A.	When the militiamen arrived, we thought that perhaps we would resist, as we usually did.  Unfortunately, they were determined in view of the rage they had shown at Saint Paul.  They broke in the gates with lot of strength.  We, as we usually did, resisted with the gendarme who were at the 
	Holy Family, even a few refugees came to help us, but when the militiamen saw -- noted that we were resisting from inside, they jumped over the gate.  When Father Munyeshyaka saw that the situation was really insupportable, we couldn't resist, he went by the gate below and said, "Keep holding on, I will help you".  So he went down to the gate into the vicarage or something like that.  The militiamen came in and everybody scattered and he came with reinforcement, military reinforcements, soldiers as reinforcements.  And when the soldiers arrived things -- they dispersed the militiamen, chased them out of the Sainte Famille -- Holy Family and stayed there and calm was restored. 
Q.	How much time passed between the departure of Munyeshyaka and his return with the soldiers?  
A.	It was about 10:00 when we saw the soldiers coming, about 10:00.  I did not look at my watch.  We did not have time to look at our wristwatches, but when I compute the time that passed, it was 30 minutes but less than an hour.  Therefore, I would say about 10 o'clock. 
Q.	The soldiers, were they also with the préfet of Kigali-ville préfecture? 
A.	I repeat, if they were with the préfet of Kigali, I would have seen him.  I would have noticed.  I would have looked and seen him, but I did not see him.  I did not see him, he was not there. 
Q.	How much time did it take the soldiers to disperse the militiamen on that morning? 
A.	As soon as the militiamen arrived, the militia saw the soldiers were stronger than they were.  And I told you the militiamen were people that I would consider hooligans, and when they saw the soldiers coming, they immediately left the place. 
Q.	What did you personally do after the militiamen departed? 
A.	After the departure of the militiamen the soldiers and the Red Cross began gathering the corpses because the militiamen had killed people.  And I don't know how many because I did not have the time to count the dead.  I personally and Munyeshyaka, we went to the refugees who were there because everybody was in a panic; people had fled, others were crying.  We went to the people to give them moral assistance and asking them to go back to their respective places.  Life continued as we were accustomed to it. 
Q.	Did you come to leave Holy Family parish after that incident on the 17th of June 1994? 
A.	On 17th I stayed with Father Munyeshyaka.  We continued our activities of encarding the refugees.  All day I was by his side. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us whether in the course of that day Father Munyeshyaka received a visit from the préfet of Kigali? 
A.	I think I must repeat that if the préfet of Kigali had been present where I was, I would have noticed it.  That day, I repeat, I stayed back at Munyeshyaka's side.  Munyeshyaka had no contact with 
	Préfet Renzaho. 
Q.	Did you have occasion to leave the parish subsequently, Witness? 
A.	On that day when I was with Munyeshyaka, we were consoling each other, trying to give each other strength.  He told me, "My dear brother, you have suffered, you will go mad.  You must rest.  I have never seen you rest.  You are going to overwork yourself", he said.  And, therefore, I said, "Fine, 
	good night, then I will see you tomorrow.  I am leaving you with great sadness.  I must go to rest a bit." And it was on the 18th that I left the capital and since I left, I have never gone back.  Thank you.
Q.	Until the date of your departure, Witness, did you have any idea as to the relations that might exist between Father Munyeshyaka and the préfet of Kigali-ville, Kigali town? 
A.	Frankly, Renzaho's name never came up or any question of his relations with Munyeshyaka, all the more so since amongst the préfectoral authorities, I told -- I gave you the name of Aloys Simpunga, any time we had a problem whether at Saint Paul or at Sainte Famille -- at Holy Family, it was that 
	Mr. Aloys Simpunga would come to see us.  I never saw any relations between Munyeshyaka and the préfet.  I never saw them together, so I cannot say there was any relation.  That is what was my experience and that is what I witnessed. 
Q.	Let us come back a bit to the Saint Paul pastoral centre, Witness, and I would like to put the following question to you.  Did you have a telephone there? 
A.	Yes, there was a telephone line but it did not function.  It was cut off at the end of April, beginning of May.  Throughout May until I left Saint Paul, the telephone was not working, it was faulty.  I think that is due to the fact that the electricity was off. 
MR. MOSES:  
I want to note again for the record that that bit of information was never in the statement and never suggested to any Prosecution witness, and I want the record to note it accordingly.  Thank you, 
Your Honour.  

MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, this time I shall respond, for the record.  This is an item of information that was brought up by one of the Prosecution witnesses whose name we know and whose name was mentioned here.  I don't remember the pseudonym but the name is there, so I don't see how I can be prevented from dealing with this issue because of lack of notice.  It was Witness KZ. 
MR. MOSES:  
Absolutely, Your Honour, the issue which I wanted to make quite clear is that, firstly, we had no notice of this issue to be raised.  Secondly, it was never suggested to KZ that the telephone at Saint Paul's was not working from some time in early May onwards, which Your Honours, having no doubt recalling KZ's evidence, is a fairly important feature which was never put to him or suggested to him that the telephone wasn't working at Saint Paul's. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have not used the word "objection", Mr. Moses, in this regard. 
MR. MOSES:  
The answer being given now, Your Honour, I wasn't aware of it.  I am simply now saying I want the objection noted to the question and answer and certainly I would be objecting to any further questions.  It is pointless objecting now that the answer has been given, but it's there, but I want the record to note. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is noted.  

Shall we move on? 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, on this point my only purpose is to know whether while the phone was working you had an opportunity to use it or to call any authority whatsoever? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And now the Chamber wants to rule on (inaudible) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, Court reporter, did you hear what the President said? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The entire Bench is of the view that this should have been communicated to the Prosecution.  We also are of the opinion that this matter should have been raised with the witness that testified to this previously, Witness KZ.  The question now is the legal consequence to be drawn from the fact that these two requirements were not complied with by the Defence.  This is a borderline issue.  
Two Judges will allow the question and take into consideration that this was not put to the previous witness in connection with its general credibility assessments and overall weighing of the evidence.  And it is also noted that it is always a possibility to recall a previous witness.  One judge would vote for exclusion of the evidence.  So that is the situation and you are allowed to ask that last question, 
Mr. Nekuie, but then we want you to move on. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, when the phone was working, and you said that it worked until about the end of April, did you personally or did Father Hakizimana use the phone to call for help from any authorities at all? 
A.	Thank you.  We never used that telephone when it was working to call for help from the authorities because the attacks -- the incursions I have mentioned, we managed to repulse without having recourse to the authorities.  I do not see why we would call the authorities when we managed on our own.  Moreover, to call the authorities, one would -- must have a purpose, a reason.  Of course, well, Simpunga, Aloys, the sous-préfet, came to see us regularly.  He came, he would see if there was a problem.  When we had a problem, we would tell him.  He would go off and he would come back with a solution, especially for medicine, for food, for provisions and for water. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness, you have answered my question.  

I should now like to speak to you of acts of sexual violence, sexual assault.  Did you see any cases of rape while you were at Saint Paul?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And we look forward to hearing your answer to that question after the lunch break and we will start at 3:05, five minutes past three.  

What is approximately the duration of the examination-in-chief, Mr. Nekuie, approximately? 
MR. NEKUIE:
I don't think I will take more than a quarter of an hour, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is why we thought we could have two hours lunch break today.  The Court is adjourned. 
(Court recessed at 1308H) 
(Pages 33 to 43 by Sithembiso Moyo)










(Court resumed at 1505H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon.  

Prosecution?  

No, you had 15 minutes left, you said, or maybe 20.  Please go ahead; you're right.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President.  Thank you.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, when we adjourned for lunch we were dealing with the matter of the rapes, and my question was as follows:  Did you observe any cases of rapes at the Saint Paul pastoral centre throughout that period?  
A.	Thank you.  During the time when I was at Saint Paul and at Sainte Famille I never witnessed or heard of any rape.  The situation which we were, the infrastructures, the people who were there, I believe such things could not occur.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  But, Witness, when referring to Sainte Famille, you indicated that there were so many refugees that, to your mind, there were around 18,000 people.  Do you believe, given the large number of people, that you could know whether there were cases of rapes or not?  
A.	Thank you.  In view of the number of people who were there, I wish to confirm to you that there could not be any rapes.  I moved around -- what I used to do was that I moved around amongst the refugees to determine what their problems were.  You can imagine, if you have 18,000 people in a small centre, they were like ants.  They were on top of one another.  

And since people were grouped along with their families, when somebody would go to the toilet, he would be accompanied by another member of his family, because the infrastructures that were available at Saint Paul and Sainte Famille, especially for the toilets were simply holes that had been dug in the ground, and the walls of which were made up of branches of pine trees, and the separation between the different toilets were made of branches.  So they were makeshift toilets, Turkish toilets as they are called, and there were no doors to close them.  So, as you can imagine, 18,000 people who would have to go to the toilet, people would queue up, and the -- as children in front of a school.  The toilets inside the building were not being used, and that is why we had built the toilets outside, so it was impossible to have any cases of rapes. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness, for your clarifications.  

Witness, last question:  You referred to two gendarmes who were posted at Saint Paul and who were killed.  Were there gendarmes or not at Sainte Famille?  And if your answer is in the affirmative, from when were they posted there?  
A.	There were five gendarmes at Sainte Famille, if I'm not mistaken.  I believe there were five of them.  It was a small group.  I went to Sainte Famille from the 10th onwards, as I stated previously.  When I went there, I saw the gendarmes I referred to.  
Q.	Are you referring to the 10th of April or to the 10th of any other month?  
A.	The 10th of April.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, Your Honour -- Your Honours, this marks the end of the examination-in-chief of this witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Prosecution?  
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, do you accept that there was a genocide in Rwanda of the Tutsi ethnic group between April and July 1994?  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, as far as I'm concerned I do not accept that there was a genocide of the Tutsi.  Let me be more explicit:  I accept that there were interethnic killings which took place on a spontaneous basis, but as to say that there was a genocide, I believe this is simply politics and has nothing to do with the truth.  I was in the country throughout the war.  People died, that is true, and I regret the fact that there were deaths, be it on the side of the Tutsis or of the Hutus.  People died because they belonged to a specific ethnic group.  As far as I'm concerned, I would call what happened interethnic killings.  Thank you -- and I take full responsibility for what I'm stating.  
Q.	Good.  So as far as you concerned, no one is guilty of genocide because there was no genocide in Rwanda during April to July 1994.  That's a fair suggestion, isn't it, as far as you're concerned?  
A.	Thank you.  I said previously that there were interethnic killings.  If there are people who are guilty, they can be found on both sides.  And I believe the responsibility is shared.  And I'm quite surprised -- since we are here to speak the truth, I'm surprised to note that one side is considered as being guilty and the other as innocent.  Of course, this is a matter to be dealt with by justice.  But we are outside the system, and this is what we note, and which we regret.  And I wish to say that the Tribunal is biased, and this is a question I've been wondering about ever since it was set up.  I apologise for telling you the truth.  Thank you.  
Q.	Well, thank you for that also.  But, in answer to my question, if there was no genocide, no one could be guilty of genocide, from your point of view; isn't that your position?  
A.	Yes, that is my position.  Thank you.  
Q.	Is this your first visit to Arusha, Witness?  
A.	Yes, indeed, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	And so therefore you have never heard live testimony of any witness who has testified and been examined and cross-examined in this court, have you?  
A.	No, I never met anyone.  
Q.	Not only did you never meet anyone, Witness, you never heard any such evidence, did you?  
A.	Monsieur le procureur -- 
Q.	No, Witness, before you go on, would you agree -- it's a yes or no answer; have you heard anyone or not?  I take it from the fact that you've not been in Arusha, the answer's no.  Would you confirm that?  
A.	I never heard anyone testify.  Thank you.  
Q.	And despite not having the benefit that Their Honours have of listening to witnesses in determining which are telling the truth and which are lying, you were prepared, in a statement you provided to the Defence, to say this, didn't you:  

"I note that the ICTR practices restricted justice.  It makes up culprits, judges and condemns innocent people under false evidence, and fabricated (sic) charges."  

That's the statement you made for the Defence, isn't it?  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, and I had told you previously that I had never heard anyone testify.  If it -- this is what I've been able to see on the internet using modern means of communication.  I read newspapers, as anybody else.  But as for having heard anyone testify, I confirm that I never heard anyone testify.  But I do read newspapers and I follow what's in the news, thank you. 
Q.	Well, firstly, do you agree that's the statement that you provided to the Defence, yes or no, what I read out to you?  
A.	That was my statement.  
Q.	Thank you.  And do I understand from your evidence-in-chief, according to you, you saw this Accused only once between April and July 1994, and that was on the 16th of June 1994?  Yes or no?  
A.	Yes, I saw him, even though I did not speak with him.  
Q.	Did you have a personal relationship with the Accused prior to April 1994?  Did you know him personally?  
A.	I knew him in his capacity as an official because I lived in his préfecture, the one he headed.  But I never had any personal contacts with him.  
Q.	That didn't stop you, however, did it, Witness, in making this statement to the Defence in your statement:  "The charges carried against Renzaho and Wenceslas are instruments of revenge which camouflage the real truth."  That's what you said to the Defence, isn't it?  
A.	Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	And you also said to the Defence:  "The false charges carried against Renzaho and Wenceslas are the fruits of a political machination which aims at demonising innocent people."  You also said that in your statement, didn't you?  Yes or no?  
A.	Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution.  Yes.  
Q.	Now, you have provided for the Trial Chamber a map with some roadblocks shown.  Do you agree, Witness, that there was also a roadblock in the middle of May, manned by militia, that was in the compound of Sainte Famille church, outside the main door?  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, the roadblocks that I set up were those where we were passing through.  If the militiamen set up a roadblock, where was -- could you please remind me of the location of the roadblock you referred to?  
Q.	It was inside the compound of Sainte Famille church.  Beside the church.  We're talking about a period in mid-May.  Do you remember seeing such a barrier there?  
A.	The roadblock that was next to Sainte Famille church was a roadblock that was manned jointly by the militiamen who were on the OAU Boulevard which led to Sainte Famille.  When one was at Saint Paul, one could see that roadblock with the militiamen.  So it is the same roadblock that I indicated.  
Q.	Witness, the map that you provided to the Trial Chamber indicated a roadblock on the main road.  I'm not talking about a roadblock on the main road; I'm talking about a barrier inside the compound of Sainte Famille.  Do you agree that there was such a barrier there in mid-May, at least?  
A.	Let me repeat that the roadblock that I drew, I was not able to separate the two roadblocks.  The roadblock you're referring to is the one that was at the entrance of Sister Abizeramariya on the road leading to Saint Paul, Sainte Famille, and Kinyamateka.  It was at that junction, which I did not separate on the map I gave.  It was behind the brasserie kiosk, as I explained previously.  Thank you.  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, I think there were a number of words used. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we need the spelling of these names.  

Now, the entrance of Sister who, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS: 
Abizeramariya.  A-B-I-Z-E-R-A-M-A-R-I-Y-A.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And this word, Abizeramariya, is in one word?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, in one word.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  Then this road led to Saint Paul, Sainte Famille, and the third location.  Can you repeat the third location, please?  

THE WITNESS: 
Kinyamateka.  Can I spell it out?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, please.  
THE WITNESS: 
K-I-N-Y-A-M-A-T-E-K-A.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And then you said you were behind a kiosk.  How did you identify that kiosk?  I think it was a French expression?  
THE WITNESS: 
It was the kiosk that the breweries would place in different locations, so it was the kiosk of the brewery.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Oh, so what is -- what, was it -- did you say Bralirwa or did you use another expression?  
THE WITNESS: 
The brewery was the plant that was in Kicukiro, and which produced lemonade.  Bralirwa would produce beer.  The brewery was in the town; some of the shops only sold lemonade.  So it was different.  So the brewery and Bralirwa are two different things. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But you used the word brasserie, maybe?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I used the word brasserie, in French, which means brewery, instead of Bralirwa.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Those were the words, I think.  
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, how many priests were there at Saint Paul's during the April to June period?  
A.	The -- there were many.  There's a long list, but if you so wish, let me give you a list of the priests from the 6th of April onwards.  Very well, let me give you the name of the resident priests. 
Q.	I don't even need that, Witness.  I just need the number.  
A.	Okay. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
"Very well", says the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the number is?  
THE WITNESS: 
I am trying to think, because there were many priests who had also sought refuge there.  There was the parish priest with his vicar -- the parish priest of Sainte Famille.  

I wish to apologise, Mr. President, but the -- there are some of them who left during the events, so it is not easy to know how many there are.  Perhaps I should tell you how many priests passed through Saint Paul's.  Because many left during the course of the events and I did not count them all.  Do you want me to give you the names?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What I want you to do now is simply to be silent for a moment and think, and then come up with a number.  Will you do that, please?  Because we don't need your reflection process, we need the result.  Please help us.  
THE WITNESS: 
Oui.  

Mr. President, please, could I be given a specific time frame between which-and-which date, because it's difficult to provide an answer to the question.  There were priests who were there, as I stated, there was a delegation of bishops, the bishops left at some stage, the others left afterwards, the director left, he was evacuated -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Witness, don't make -- use so many words.  We understand that you want a time frame.  That's enough.  Now the Prosecutor will offer you a time frame.  
THE WITNESS: 
Very well.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	How many were -- priests were there, say, on the 10th of April -- approximately?  
A.	Around 10 priests.  
Q.	And how many priests were there as at the 17th of June?  
A.	The same 10 priests, approximately.  
Q.	One of those priests was Father Paulin -- spelt P-A-U-L-I-N -- Munyazikwiye -- spelt M-U-N-Y-A-Z-I-K-W-I-Y-E -- correct?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And as at the 10th of April, how many priests were there at Sainte Famille?  
A.	On the 10th of April there was only one priest, Father Munyeshyaka, Wenceslas.  His parish priests had sought refuge at Saint Paul's.  
Q.	All right.  And on the 17th of June, how many priests were there at Sainte Famille?  
A.	There was one priest, Munyeshyaka, Wenceslas, because the other priests would spend their days and their nights at Saint Paul's.  
Q.	All right.  Well, we'll move on to your days and nights, Witness.  You've told the Trial Chamber that you would go from Saint Paul to Sainte Famille at around 10 or 11 in the morning.  And how long did you remain at Sainte Famille?  
A.	I would spend almost the whole afternoon in Sainte Famille, and it would depend on the activities I was to carry out there.  I cannot tell you precisely that I would go there at 10 and I would go back at 3 or 4.  When there were a number of activities I was to help Munyeshyaka with, I would remain there until it was time for me to go back home to go to bed.  So I must say that I did not keep the time exactly.  
Q.	You'll agree with me that you were sleeping at the Saint Paul's centre, weren't you?  
A.	Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
Q.	And do you agree with me that when you weren't at Saint -- I'll rephrase the question.  Father Munyeshyaka was often the only priest at Sainte Famille, wasn't he?  
A.	Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	And you've told us that there were a large number of refugees at Sainte Famille, a number I think you've estimated at 18,000.  And it was a large compound, wasn't it?  
A.	The compound was not large, it was quite small, and there was not enough space.  And this is why I told you that people were piled up like bricks or ants.  Thank you.  
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Mr. Witness, what do you mean saying a "small" compound?  What were approximately -- was the size of this compound, Saint Paul and Sainte Famille?  
THE WITNESS: 
I was saying that it was small in view of the number of people who were there.  I cannot give you the size of that plot because I am not a surveyor.  But what I can tell you is that it was quite small as compared to the number of people who were staying there.  Thank you.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And, bearing in mind, Witness, that you weren't at Sainte Famille all the time, to be fair, you can't say what Wenceslas Munyeshyaka or anyone else at Sainte Famille was doing all the time, can you?  
A.	Well, I am not God in order to be omnipresent, Counsel for the Prosecution.  I cannot be aware of what he was doing in my absence.  But on the issue of rapes on which you put questions to me, let me tell you that there are some things that cannot be hidden, especially those that you are referring to.  Besides, let me tell you that the atmosphere there, in light of the situation and the experience of people, I do not believe anyone would have thought of having intercourse.  

So let me please continue, because this is an interesting subject, Counsel for the Prosecution.  You should imagine under what stress we were, and as human beings, for it to -- 
Q.	Sorry to interrupt you, but the point is I asked -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Listen.  You have to slow down, Mr. Witness.  And here comes the continuation of the question.  

BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, just to make it quite clear, I asked no question about rapes.  You're the one who have raised it rather quickly in your answer.  But we'll move on.  

Now, in respect of your time at Saint Paul's, do you recall in April members of the population and Interahamwe coming and cutting down banana trees and other bushes in the compound?  
A.	Thank you.  Regarding the people who allegedly came to cut the banana trees, they were not only militiamen, because if the banana trees were cut it was for a matter linked to security.  Since the militiamen were saying that there were too many bushes, it was necessary to clear the bushes.  If the militiamen cleared the bushes and the banana trees, do you believe they would leave the Tutsis who were there?  We had to cut the bushes following a request by the militiamen, because we did not want the militiamen to enter the bushes.  And they were outside, they were observing us to make sure that the orders would be complied with, because if we had not done it ourselves, they would have come in and cut the bushes.  And you can imagine what would have occurred.  Thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	So, in answer to my question, it was really "yes", you do recall that happening.  
A.	Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	And on that same day, in fact, some seven men were taken away and not seen again; isn't that correct?  
A.	Well, I cannot answer you in the affirmative; that is not correct.  
Q.	Is that something which might have happened while you were elsewhere?  
A.	At the beginning I told you that I would shuttle between Saint Paul's and Sainte Famille.  When I saw that the banana trees were being cut, I understood -- I was told why they were being cut, and it seemed logical to me.  But as to say that there were people who were taken away in front of me, my answer cannot be yes because I did not witness such an event.  
Q.	All right.  And do you recall at around the beginning of May -- actually, I'll rephrase that.  Did soldiers from the Muvumba -- spelt M-U-V-U-M-B-A -- battalion launch an attack at Saint Paul's?  Or come to Saint Paul's, for that matter?  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, when I came here, I swore that I would speak the truth and nothing but the truth, and I would speak about what I was an eyewitness to.  I told you that I would shuttle between Saint Paul's and Sainte Famille.  If the soldiers came during my absence, I am not in a position to answer your question.  Thank you.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, were you present at Saint Paul's on the 14th of June when gendarmes and militia came with a list of people, and some perhaps 30 or 40 men were taken away from Saint Paul's and killed? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution.  As regards the events of the 14th of June, I was in Gitarama.  On the 13th, in the morning, some members of my family -- because I had a member of my family who was hospitalised in Kigali and who was -- and then the war broke out.  On the 13th, since matters were getting worse, I was asked to accompany them to Gitarama.  I went to Gitarama and I came back on the 14th in the afternoon.  When I arrived in Runda around 6 p.m., there was a curfew so that I was not able to cross the Nyabarongo river, so I slept in Runda, and I came back on the 15th in the early morning.  So I arrived in Kigali on the 15th.  So on the 14th I was not in Kigali.  I wish you to take note of that, thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Slow down, Mr. Witness.  It's too fast.  
THE WITNESS: 
Very well.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And your evidence this morning was that in the early hours of the 17th of June in the morning, you fled from Saint Paul's to Sainte Famille.  That's correct, isn't it?  
A.	That is correct, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	So you weren't with Father Paulin and Father Célestin on that morning, were you?  
A.	The 14th I was not in Kigali.  That's what I said, the 14th.  
Q.	I'm talking about the morning of the 17th.  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, follow the chronology of the dates.  I repeat:  On the 13th -- in the day of the 13th -- 
Q.	I'm sorry to stop you, Witness.  I wonder if there is a -- 
MR. MOSES: 
Is there a difference, Your Honour, between the English and the French?  If there is not -- 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	-- I will repeat my question a third time, Witness.  I'm talking about a morning of the 17th of June.  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Were you at Saint Paul's or were you still in Gitarama then?  
A.	I remember that on the 17th of June, it was the day where the militiamen attacked Sainte Famille, so I was in Kigali.  And I have to be specific.  The RPF attacked Saint Paul in the night of the 16 to the 17th.  I'd already returned to Kigali because I returned from Gitarama on the 15th, continuing on my activities.  And then the night, from the 16th to the 17th the RPF attacked Saint Paul, and on the 17th the militia -- militiamen attacked Sainte Famille.  And I was there for those events.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I think we will backtrack for a moment.  

You gave an overview, Mr. Witness, of what you did the 13th, the 14th, and the 15th of June.  And there was a curfew when you arrived at a certain place around 6 p.m.  What was the name of that place?  
THE WITNESS: 
Runda, R-U-N-D-A.  It's on -- just outside of town.  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And backtracking again, you had confirmed your earlier evidence that you had fled from Saint Paul to Sainte Famille early that morning; isn't that correct?  
A.	On the 17th, in the morning, yes.  
Q.	So after you went to Sainte Famille, you weren't with Father Célestin and Father Paulin, were you?  
A.	In the morning of the 17th there was complete chaos.  Saint Paul no longer existed.  There was no one at Saint Paul.  Father Hakizimana, Célestin, fled to Saint Michel cathedral, which was at the top of the hill on the plateau, next to PVK -- PVK.  There he found his co-religionists (sic), Kabagazi (phonetic), Jean Pierre, his co-clergymen.  And Paulin had not returned to Saint Paul.  We did not -- our paths did not cross again. 
JUDGE ARREY: 
Please, please, Witness, could you just answer the questions that are put to you without volunteering other information?  

You already told us in your evidence-in-chief that Saint Paul was attacked at 6 a.m. on the 17th.  And because of the way the people were aggressive, you fled -- 
THE WITNESS: 
Non.  Non, non.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
That's not what you said, that you fled and went to Sainte Famille?  
THE WITNESS: 
When you speak of attacker...(microphones overlapping). 
JUDGE ARREY: 
(Microphones overlapping) Saint Paul.  The militia came and were looting around 6 in the morning, and you were in the fathers' kitchen.  And because of the way they were aggressive, you ran away and went to Sainte Famille.  Was that your evidence, or not, this morning?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, but the -- 
JUDGE ARREY: 
Just listen to me, please.  Is it yes or no?  Is that what you said?  
THE WITNESS: 
Oui. 
JUDGE ARREY: 
Okay, so if that is what you said and you were not there, you had gone to Sainte Famille, how would you know where Father Célestin was after you had left, to know that he went to a hill at the second place?  
THE WITNESS: 
Let me answer.  

What was I supposed to do on the morning of the 17th?  We were wondering, where's so-and-so, where is this one or where is that one?  And that's when Father Munyeshyaka, who kept his co-clergymen, he told me, "He is with" -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
I'm sorry, I didn't get the name.  
THE WITNESS: 
-- "he's there at Saint Michel".  We had to inform each other.  That's how we knew.  But when they attacked, it was complete chaos.  Everyone -- every man for himself.  On the morning on the 17th we were wondering, where is who and what, and that's what I did.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You mentioned a name with whom Father Munyeshyaka was together.  Can you repeat that name?  
THE WITNESS: 
Munyeshyaka or Hakizimana?  Which one?  Could you please tell me which person?  Father Munyeshyaka or Father Célestin?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, if you could just listen.  I will repeat my question.  I will read out, word for word, what I just asked you:  

You mentioned a name with whom Father Munyeshyaka was together.  Can you please repeat that name?  
THE WITNESS: 
I didn't mention Father Munyeshyaka, I mentioned Father Hakizimana.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You only mentioned one name, and that was Father Hakizimana?  
THE WITNESS: 
Oh, sorry, yes.  I said Father Munyeshyaka had -- during the RPF raid, Father Munyeshyaka managed to hide his -- Father Anaclet Mwumvaneza, his deacon.  He had taken refuge at Saint Paul.  During the RPF attack, everyone ran away.  Father Munyeshyaka managed -- I don't know how he did it, but he managed to save his deacon.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Let us say, for want of a better word. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
See, you did mention another name, and now we understood that the first name of that other person was Anaclet; was that so?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, please spell that first name first, and then his last name afterwards, and then we can proceed.  
THE WITNESS: 
Anaclet is spelt A-N-A-C-L-E-T.  And his -- his other name is -- surname M-W-U-M-V-A-N-E-Z-A.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That was very helpful, thank you.  Here comes the next question.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	This morning, Witness, you had said, when the militia arrived on that day at Sainte Famille, everyone sought a way of disappearing.  Where did you disappear to, Witness?  
A.	Thank you.  When the militiamen came, I was with Munyeshyaka at the presbytery with other people.  We were discussing what had happened at Saint Paul's.  Me, when the militiamen came, I stayed there, Munyeshyaka left, and I stayed with the people at the Sainte Famille presbytery.  Thank you.  
Q.	Okay, thank you for that.  And how long did you remain at the presbytery for?  
A.	I told you that I stayed at Sainte Famille until the morning of the 18th.  So I stayed with Father Munyeshyaka at the presbytery, and I remind you that it wasn't different from where the people were.  Even in the priests' bedroom there were people.  So there was no difference between the presbytery, the church, the courtyard; they were all full of people.  
Q.	Yes, well, we've heard about people being in the priests' bedroom, but we'll come to that later.  

On the 17th of June, Witness, in the morning when the militia attacked, do I understand from your evidence that you went to the presbytery?  
A.	When we speak of Sainte Famille, it's the presbytery that comes to mind first of all.  That's where I went because I had to join Munyeshyaka.  
Q.	So from the time the militia arrived until the end of the attack, you were in presbytery; is that what we're to understand?  
A.	Yes, I was hidden in the presbytery.  
Q.	Thank you.  On the 17th of June, did you see any officials with the militia and others who were taking part in that attack?  
A.	I did say a while back that the militiamen for me were hooligans, and when I saw the militiamen there was no figure of authority.  There was no figure of authority; it was only the militiamen.  
Q.	Well, without wanting to contradict you too strongly, Witness, this morning you in fact said that they did have some leaders, and in fact you mentioned Angeline and Odette.  My question is:  Did you see Angeline or Odette at Sainte Famille on the 17th of June?  

MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, before the witness answers, I should like the Prosecutor to repeat exactly what the witness said.  The witness did not say this morning that the militiamen were in Angelina's company.  It wasn't in the context of the 17th that he mentioned Angelina.  We must reflect accurately what the witness has stated.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The record will speak for itself.  Now we are interested in the answer to this question.  

Can you answer?  
THE WITNESS: 
I told you that the militiamen were young.  When they attacked the Saint Paul, they said -- when they came to look for Rukundo, they said -- I asked him, "What are you doing?"  And they said, "If we are sent by such-and-such a" -- 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Can't you listen to the questions?  Now, I will read out the question as it was posed.  "My question is", said the Prosecutor "did you see Angeline or Odette at Sainte Famille on the 17th of June?"  Now, that calls for a yes or no answer. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The witness's microphone.  
THE WITNESS: 
I did not see either the one -- neither the one nor the other.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, when was the first time you met with a representative of the Defence of Mr. Renzaho?  I don't need a precise date; if you can give us a year and a month that would be of assistance.  
A.	Perhaps they can remind me -- maybe counsel could remind me.  I don't remember the date.  I cannot recall the date.  Counsel, could you remind me?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's not necessary, thank you very much, Mr. Nekuie.  
THE WITNESS: 
It wasn't long ago.  It wasn't long ago.  
(Pages 44 to 56 by Kirstin McLean)





1600H
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Do you remember which month, or not? 
A.	It must be last month. 
Q.	So you will agree with me that you provided a statement to the Defence, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And how many times did you meet with the Defence since you have been in Arusha? 
A.	Three times. 
Q.	And, as we understand it, the first time you've ever mentioned anything about the telephone in 
	Saint Paul's was on the last occasion last night, is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What was the telephone number, do you recall, for Saint Paul's? 
A.	Unfortunately, I do not recall. 
Q.	Do you remember that it began with the prefix 7, or not? 
A.	Well, it would be like any other Kigali number.  I can't remember.  I've forgotten everything in respect to telephones.  I do not attach importance to it.  Thank you. 
Q.	And we've heard from a number of witnesses, both for the Prosecution and the Defence, that throughout the period of April to June and July there were no problems with the telephone numbers that commenced -- parts of Kigali which commenced with the number 7, but there were problems at some stage with numbers that commenced with the number 8; do you agree with that or not?  Or didn't you use the telephone? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I will not comment on what other witnesses have told you; what they say commits them.  I tell you what I experienced, what I lived through, what I know.  That's their problem.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, but the question is whether you recognise, based on your own experience, that there was a difference between phone numbers commencing with 7 or 8; do you have any knowledge of that?  Or is your answer, "I do not know"?  
THE WITNESS:
I did not check that because I didn't call.  During the war, I didn't telephone.  I didn't need to telephone.  If there was a problem it concerns those who used the telephone.  I cannot speak on that. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You didn't use the phone for 100 days, that is your evidence?  
THE WITNESS:
I did not need to use the phone.  I was at my work. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And you've spoken at the end of your testimony about the issues of rapes, both at Saint Paul and Sainte Famille.  I want to focus, very briefly, on the issue of rapes at Sainte Famille.  From what your evidence is you were working closely with Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka, weren't you?  
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	And that would have been apparent to those who took refuge at Sainte Famille, wouldn't it? 
A.	I believe so. 
Q.	You would've been the very last person anyone would've confided in on such a sensitive matter, wouldn't you? 
A.	I'm sorry, I did not understand the translation.  I couldn't follow. 
Q.	As -- as someone who was seen as a close associate of Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka, I am suggesting to you that victims would have seen you as one of the last persons to confide in if they had been sexually violated by Father Wenceslas, or anyone else, because you were seen as an associate of his? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, the work we were doing was not the work of authority.  It was humanitarian.  It was apostolic.  We were not there to order people around.  We were there to help them, just as the 
	Red Cross did.  So, if there was a problem we should've known it.  Some things cannot be in (sic).  And when you speak of rapes or sexual assaults, well, I really wonder myself what about that.  Who is speaking about that?  Rape, how, where, when?  People speaking of that have another mission, another task.  That's why they know, they speak of that.  For me, I banish that from my mind.  It never existed. 
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, I have no further questions of this witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Re-examination?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, just a few matters of clarification. 
RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, when you met Mr. Renzaho's Defence team, did you give them a statement written by -- in your own hand and signed? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness asks, "What was the question?"  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	When you met members of Mr. Renzaho's Defence team, did you give that person -- of course, it was me -- a statement written and signed by yourself, written by your own hand and signed? 
A.	Yeah, I sent it by email.  I sent it by email, the statement you have before you. 
Q.	Please listen to the question:  At the time we physically met did you hand over to the Defence team a statement written in your own hand and signed? 
A.	No. 
Q.	When did you give Renzaho's Defence a written statement and signed? 
A.	I sent it by email. 
Q.	Do you remember the date or the period when you did it? 
A.	I do not remember the date, forgive me. 
Q.	In your view, how many days have elapsed since you did that and today? 
A.	Not quite two weeks. 
Q.	Thank you for that clarification, Witness.  

Witness, the last clarification:  You spoke of a banana plantation -- or banana grove -- banana groves that were cut down in the perimeter of Sainte Famille, and you said that it was on the orders of the militiamen.  But you seemed to say that it was other people who were cutting down the banana trees, did I correctly understand you? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you tell us -- can you tell the Trial Chamber who were those other people? 
A.	The militiamen thought that RPF soldiers might hide there.  So they said, "We're coming.  We want to cut that."  We thought it was a way of infiltrating of getting in Saint Paul where there were the refugees that the militiamen were looking for.  So we told them we will do that ourselves and we and the men who were there, went and cut them down.  So it wasn't the militiamen who came in and we took in -- we took the opportunity to clean up all round Saint Paul. 
Q.	Yes, but I should like it to be really clear.  You say we took the men, which men? 
A.	We took the men.  We did it.  We took the men who had sought refuge with us. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We are very fast in your exchanges now.  You are not observing the pause.  It is a miracle that we get this interpreted and transcribed.  That shows the quality of everyone in the courtroom.  But do you have to give us all these challenges?  Can't you relax and slow down?  

Now here comes the question.  Mr. Nekuie?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Well, in fact, that was my last question.  I wanted him to be specific about which men did it.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Can you repeat, Witness? 
A.	Well, as a matter of security within Saint Paul, we did not want someone else to enter the enclosure of our centre, because we were afraid that if the militiamen, whom we didn't want to succeed -- succeeded into getting into the enclosure, they would do what they were really coming for.  We thought it might be a way of entering peacefully.
Q.	Forgive me for interrupting you.  Just tell us who were the men who did that work? 
A.	We chose among the refugees the able-bodied, robust men who helped us to clear the bush. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, I think I will conclude my re-examination-in-chief at this point. 

Thank you, Witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Witness, have you heard the name Hyacinthe Rwanga?  H-Y-A-C-I-N-T-H-E, R-W-A-N-G-A. 
THE WITNESS:
No, names did not concern me.  I was not interested in names. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you ever meet anyone called Nyiratunga?  
THE WITNESS:
Could you try pronouncing that again, please?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness, is asking for the name to be pronounced clearly, sorry. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Nyiratunga.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, the pronunciation must be incorrect.  
THE WITNESS: 
Is it Nyiratenga or Nyiratunga?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Why don't you answer in the alternative?  Do you know any of those two names?
THE WITNESS:
I don't know Nyiratenga.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you know anyone called Nyiratunga?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Who was that?  
THE WITNESS:
I know her because she was a Christian at Sainte Famille.  We'd often perform the mass together and she lived in Rugenge secteur. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ever met anyone called Mukangira?  M-U-K-A-N-G-I-R-A.  
THE WITNESS:
No, that name does not strike a bell.  I don't know her. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you know anyone called Mukamuyango?  M-U-K-A-M-U-Y-A-N-G-O.  
THE WITNESS:
No, I don't know her either. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, did you at any point see soldiers at Sainte Famille in May 1994?  
THE WITNESS:
No, I did not see soldiers. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Was there a place called the French complex?  
THE WITNESS:
No, there was the French cultural centre, but not French complex at the time. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This French cultural centre, how far away was that from Sainte Famille?  
THE WITNESS:
Stone's throw, a stone's throw, just a bit higher up, at the roundabout. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Behind a church maybe?  
THE WITNESS:
No, at the corner of OAU Boulevard, and the road going to the Mille Collines.  So it was facing, facing the roundabout.  It was facing the roundabout.  Can I be more precise?  Can I?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Let me ask you about the place you are talking about.  Was that in the Kiyovu neighbourhood?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
About five minutes walking distance from Sainte Famille church, approximately?  
THE WITNESS:
No, the French cultural centre was only a few metres from Sainte Famille.  There was only a road really separating them. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But it was outside the Sainte Famille complex, wasn't it?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, yes, outside the perimeter -- enclosure of Sainte Famille. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you know Major Nsabimana?  N-S-A-B-I-M-A-N-A.  
THE WITNESS:
I did not know him. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you know where he lived?  His residence?  
THE WITNESS:
Nor did I know that. 
JUDGE ARREY: 
Witness, isn't it normal that seminarians in the higher seminary live in whole (sic) cells in the seminary?  Or you don't have that in Rwanda?  
THE WITNESS: 
(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) 
JUDGE ARREY: 
So, you were living at Saint Paul, but you only went to Sainte Famille to render assistance periodically.  According to your statement, you were living in Saint Paul but you went to Sainte Famille periodically to render assistance periodically to Father Wenceslas, is that correct?  
THE WITNESS:
I went to assist Wenceslas only during the war period.  I would usually remain in Saint Paul's.  It was during the war that I went to assist him.  Thank you. 
JUDGE ARREY: 
So at no time did you live with the préfet of Kigali?  Did you ever live with the préfet of Kigali?  Yes or no, and then I will ask the next question.  Did you ever live with the Defendant in this case?  
THE WITNESS:
I stated previously that I had had no contact whatsoever with the préfet of Kigali, thank you. 
JUDGE ARREY: 
So how then do you explain the statement you made before us, that Renzaho had never met 
Odette and Angeline?  How do you know -- how did you know he had never met them when you were not staying with him and knew nothing about him?  
THE WITNESS:
My answer is based on what I saw and what I witnessed.  I cannot say that I saw Renzaho with Angeline.  I cannot state either they were in contact when I never saw such a thing.  When I say I saw something, it means I was an eyewitness to an event. 
JUDGE ARREY: 
You also said in your statement that Father Wenceslas was a very good man, and because he was so popular other priests were envious of him, jealous of him.  Do you maintain that?  That other 
Catholic priests were jealous of another priest because he was popular?  
THE WITNESS:
I said so for a reason.  I lived amongst the priests for a while and I know how they live.  If I said that they were envious, well, it depends on the period I was referring to.  And I made such a statement because I knew them.  Otherwise how can one say that the parish priest fled the parish?  And subsequently I lived with him and I would hear what he would say because he was envious of his priest who was popular.  This is a popularity that the priest did not have.  I can confirm that.  I lived with the priests and I know him.  Thank you.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
This priest who was not popular with Father Wenceslas was a Tutsi priest, wasn't he?  Was he a 
Tutsi priest or not?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, he was a Tutsi. 
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Mr. Witness, you mentioned that Saint Paul compound was separated from this Sainte Famille compound by a wall, is it correct?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, and I did specify that there was small -- two small gates in order to make passage from one to the other easier, thank you. 
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Am I correct believing that the person who is in Saint Paul compound can't see what is going on in Sainte Famille compound?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, indeed. 
JUDGE EGOROV: 
What, approximately, was the length of this wall separating the two compounds?  Approximately?  
100 metres, less or more?  
THE WITNESS:
Not less, but perhaps 100 metres because when one talks about Sainte Famille -- let me say that when one refers to Saint Paul and Sainte Famille, Sainte Famille was housing many of the services of the church.  There were the sisters, there was the headquarters of the congregation, and there was also the bursar's office.  So all these things were within the compound of Sainte Famille, so it was large and the wall was more than 100 metres long.  Thank you. 
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Let me ask you if it is possible for you to explain to me whether it was possible for a person who was in one side of the Sainte Famille compound to see and to know what was going on in the other side of the compound?  Were there any abstracts?  

THE WITNESS:
It was not possible to see what was happening on the other side because the wall was made of bricks, so the wall was not transparent. 
JUDGE EGOROV: 
No, I am talking about the same compound for a person who was, say, in the Saint Paul -- 
Sainte Famille compound, on one side of this compound, could he observe the situation in another part, in a different -- in the opposite part of the compound of the same compound?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it was possible.  There was an open courtyard, so one could see what was happening. 
JUDGE EGOROV: 
And the church itself, was it in the middle of the compound or closer to a certain wall or side?  
THE WITNESS:
The church was in the upper part and on the other side of the church, towards the bursar's office, there was the courtyard I was referring to, where there was a small garden. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you see Odette on the 17th of June?  
THE WITNESS:
No. 
MR. MOSES: 
Sorry, Your Honour, it's a matter of witness protection.  The answer that the witness first gave to, I think, Judge Arrey's first question -- there's nothing wrong with the question, it was the answer.  I think the witness gave information which may lead to his identification.  I stand corrected, but when he was answering the question I think he volunteered some information which -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we will probably, since it is a matter of context, place the entire answer under seal.  Thank you for drawing our attention to this. 

Just a moment. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, your microphone. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  That was the end of your testimony.  Thank you for coming the long way to Arusha to testify.  In case you want to meet with Mr. Renzaho, you can just mention that to the witness protection unit and they will then arrange for such a visit.  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  I should -- yes, I should like to visit.  
(Witness excused) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, this was the last witness mentioned on the witness list for this week as originally planned.  

Before we discuss what to do in the hours and days to come, I just want to make sure that the Prosecution has received this document the Chamber wanted concerning the missing information in connection with Witness TOA; have you received it?  
MR. MOSES: 
Apparently. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We just want to make sure that you have received it and then you can reflect on this and we would raise it next week. 
MR. MOSES: 
I haven't looked at the document, but it has been received. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

You have scheduled Mr. Renzaho from the 27th to the 31st of August, Defence?  It is Thursday today.  What is your view? 
     (Pages 57 to 65 by Melissa Hook) 



















1640H
MR. NEKUIE:
We maintain this timeframe, Mr. President.  We would wish for the witness to testify from the dates we provided and, by our estimate -- by the dates indicated, the witness will have finalised his testimony.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are in no hurry when it comes to this segment.  What we are, in reality, discussing now is whether we should insist that he starts tomorrow, on Friday, or whether we should stick to your Monday proposal.  

And the Bench would be inclined to follow your proposal.  And it will start on Monday, the 27th, which also gives time for everyone to work in the days to come until Monday.  

Shall we agree on that proposal?  That seems to meet the consent of everyone.
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Mr. President.  The Accused also wished to devote this weekend to his further preparation, so it is our wish that the initial proposal be retained, if this is agreeable to all.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  

All right.  But then we will simply meet at 8:45 on Monday morning.  There will be no court session tomorrow.

The Court is adjourned.
(Court adjourned at 1643H)
