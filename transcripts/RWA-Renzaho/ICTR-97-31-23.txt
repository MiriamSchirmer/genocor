MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, the Court is in session.  

Good morning, Madam Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence.  
MR. CANTIER:
Good morning, Mr. President, good morning, Your Honours. 
ALISON DES FORGES, 
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Good morning, Madam Witness.  

Madam Witness, yesterday I -- we stopped at the point when the hostilities resumed in 1992.  You did say in your report that when the negotiations were being carried on seriously, the RPF decided to resume hostilities.  Can you confirm this to the Court, please?  
A.	I would say, rather, that when negotiations were about to begin -- because to say that negotiations were proceeding seriously at that time is not quite correct.  There had been various initiatives, and it looked likely that negotiations would, in fact, begin some time after, but it was not the case that the parties were in the midst of serious negotiations.  
Q.	But you were optimistic -- since you wrote in your report that the two parties were preparing for negotiations that appeared to be more serious? 
A.	It's always a good idea to be optimistic.  
Q.	From the military standpoint, what was the consequence of the RPF attack in June 1992? 
A.	The June 1992 attack permitted the RPF to establish control over a portion -- a small portion of 
north-eastern Rwanda in a more permanent way.  They had had forays into territory and had perhaps briefly controlled smaller areas, but this was the first substantial success they had in establishing a foothold in the north-eastern part of the country.  At the same time, the combat -- not simply their advance, but the threat of combat as well -- caused the displacement of a very large number of people, hundreds of thousands of people, who fled to the south and who, many of them, took up residence in refugee or displaced-persons camps.  
Q.	Yes, Madam Witness, let me suggest this to you, if this is possible, even though what you always tell us is interesting, but give a more concise answer to the questions that I put to you.  And my next question is:  What was the impact of this resumption of hostilities - and, these hundreds of thousands of displaced persons on interethnic relationship in Rwanda? 
A.	Assuming that the first part of your question is necessarily related to the second -- that is, when you asked me what was the impact, you mean, what was the impact on interethnic relations.  Certainly, it caused a deterioration of those relations, but one that was not universally felt or was not -- was not felt in exactly the same fashion throughout the country.  That is to say, obviously, it was the people in the north-east who suffered most, and for whom the question of relationships between Hutu and Tutsi suffered most immediately.  
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  The third offensive of the RPF was in February 1993.  What were its consequences at the level of the national -- at the level -- at the national level and also in terms of displaced persons? 
A.	The immediate term, in the short term, the result in terms of territory controlled, was that the RPF acquired control over a much larger part of not just north-eastern Rwanda, but also north central Rwanda.  These territorial gains were reversed at the time of the ceasefire when the RPF agreed to return to its original territory, and where a buffer zone was established between its territory zone of control and the rest of Rwanda.  

In terms of interethnic relations, the blow was far more serious and called into question for many the ultimate intent of the RPF -- that is to say, whether the RPF meant to reach a solution to the conflict through negotiations or whether its intent, rather, was to pursue a complete military victory.  The long-term effect of this was to push forward -- to -- to increase the reasons for distrust, particularly in the heart of several parties of -- parties opposed to the MRND that had previously been more or less in agreement with the position of collaboration with the RPF, so that the opening wedge had been driven within these parties -- a process that was to lead eventually to the division of the MDR and the PL, in particular.  
Q.	And Madam Witness, in terms of displaced persons, what was the figure then? 
A.	In the short term, the number increased to approximately 1 million.  Some of those people began returning home after a number of months, so that I'm not certain for how long the figure was at 1 million, or whether it varied slightly or significantly before April 1994.  That figure of 1 million is ordinarily quoted as representing the population of displaced persons from February 1993 through April 1994, but as far as I know, it was a figure established early on, and I do not know whether, subsequently, it may have decreased slightly.  But, in any case, the impact, of course, was enormous because the number of displaced persons represented on the order of one-seventh of the Rwandan population.  
Q.	And Madam Witness, you wrote in your report that -- and these people lived in miserable conditions in the camps at the northern portion of the capital.  What was the state of mind of these people who had to flee and abandon everything? 
A.	The persons with whom I spoke in those displaced-persons camps seemed to me to reflect a spirit of distress, fear, sorrow, rather than outright anger.  Certainly, there were some, particularly young males, who were angry and who wished to take revenge.  Perhaps it was simply that the ones I spoke with were ordinarily older and often female.  But, in any case, it is likely that there was a portion of that population that was angry and ready to strike out against the RPF -- should they be given the opportunity.  I would not say that was true of the entire population.  
Q.	These people were fleeing from their normal traditional contexts, since they were fleeing from their villages and their houses; would that be correct? 
A.	In fact, no.  There were, of course, some people who ended up somewhat isolated from their usual units of population, but at least, within the camps I visited, I saw people organised -- for example, for food distribution according to their former places of residence.  So I believe, in general, the effort was made for people to retain their original residential organisation even in the camps.  Of course, that was not completely 100 per cent possible.  
Q.	Madam Witness, you told this Court yesterday that the various episodes of war were followed by the implementation of some war tactics by the RPF; can you confirm that? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	The RPF also used the techniques of infiltration; is that correct? 
A.	It appears likely, yes, there has been some evidence provided.  The extent of that infiltration remains, however, subject to debate.  
Q.	In your book, Madam Witness, I read that in Kigali there were 147 cellules infiltrated, and you estimated the number of infiltrators -- the range was between 700 and 1,300, if my -- if I recollect rightly; is that correct? 
A.	Maître, you are not correct, and I speak not of the numbers -- which I don't have in my head either, I have to say -- but, rather, of your characterisation of these people as infiltrators.  In fact, I take a great deal of care in my text to distinguish between civilians who are supporters of the RPF, and to the best of my recollection, the passage to which you refer, does indeed deal with persons who are political supporters of the RPF -- that is to say, Rwandans resident in Rwanda, long term, who have chosen to espouse the ideals or the objectives of the RPF.  This is very different from the word infiltrators, which to my mind, and I believe to minds of most people, implies a person not resident in a community who comes from the outside with the specific purpose of in some way serving a military objective.  There is a very important difference and that difference, in part, is the one we have been discussing already in this Court in terms of what represented or did not represent a legitimate target for a civilian self-defence effort.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence Counsel, there may be a difference between the English and French version of a previous question you posed, and in order to dispel any doubt there, I will ask you to confirm whether you said:

"Madam, you told us yesterday that episodes of war was followed by implementation of tactics implemented by the RPF; can you confirm that?"
Was that, indeed, your wording in French? 
MR. CANTIER:
Oui, Monsieur le Président. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And again, with other words, you referred to the word guerrilla tactic, wasn't that the point? 
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, that's what we are losing now twice in the English version, and I just wanted the question to be precise and I think that's what you answered to.  Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour, I'm listening to the -- to the French directly, so I am not hearing the translation.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I know that you are listening to the French original, but when we read later your response in English, there was not a total similarity between the question and the answer.  Thank you very much for this clarification.  

Do you want to proceed, Maître Cantier? 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Yes, Madam Witness, I want to be careful about avoiding any confusion between the infiltrators -- that is, the persons that were placed by the RPF military establishment in Kigali town -- I do not want to confuse them with civilian members of the RPF.  So when I referred to infiltrators in my question, I'm referring to RPF members who were specifically placed there for military purposes or for guerrilla purposes in Kigali town.  
A.	I would still suggest, Maître, that you need to return to the text, which you seem to be trying to recall here.  Because it was certainly not my intention -- and, I believe, I wrote very clearly in that text -- that the groups I was describing by those numbers were groups of Rwandans resident in the city who had -- or, in the country, who had chosen to affiliate themselves with the RPF.  And I believe those figures date from the time when the RPF was a signatory to the final Arusha Accords, and therefore, a legitimate political movement in Rwanda.  

So, I -- I think it's really extremely important not to confuse this idea of infiltrator or even of partisans placed there by the movement, as you have just used the words, but, rather, to say, Rwandans who voluntarily chose to join a political movement which they found appealing.  
Q.	But which, at that time, was at war against the legitimate authority in Rwanda? 
A.	No, in fact, Maître, as I just pointed out, those figures I believe dated from the period after the 
Arusha Accords, when the RPF had signed a peace treaty, and when it was anticipated that it would become a political party, like any other, participating in a new government; it was not a time of war.  
Q.	Madam, to whom will you ascribe the killing of politicians, Gatabazi, Gapyisi and Rwambuka? 
A.	I have not myself made an extensive study of those three cases.  I know that at one point, the investigations of Rwandan investigators in conjunction with the UN civilian police attributed the assassination of Gatabazi, in any case, to assailants who were not RPF.  I am, of course, aware of subsequent information presented by Mr. Ruzibiza and others.  I have not myself verified this information, but I recognise that the allegations have been made and made with a significant amount of supporting detail.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Gatabazi, we have.  Could you just give us the spelling of the two other names, Maître? 
MR. CANTIER:
Gapyisi is G-A-P-Y-I-S-I.  Rwambuka is R-W-A-M-B-U-K-A.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Madam, these killings were the cause -- constituted the cause of the pogrom against the Tutsi? 
A.	(Microphones overlapping)... Maître, the killing of Rwambuka and the killing of Gapyisi had no immediate impact.  Are you referring after -- are you referring to the killings that took place in Kigali after the assassination of Gatabazi?  Or, are you referring to something else? 
Q.	Yes, Madam Witness, more specifically, the killings that took place following the killing of Gatabazi. 
A.	It appears to me likely that the killings of Tutsi in February 1994 were the immediate result of the assassination of the head of the CDR party, Mr. Bucyana, who was killed in Butare immediately before the killings of Tutsi took place.  It is accurate that Bucyana was killed by a mob in Butare -- that apparently was motivated by a desire for revenge for the death of Gatabazi.  So in that sense, one could trace the killings of Tutsi in an indirect way back to the assassination of Gatabazi, but one could not establish an immediate and direct one-to-one relationship.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Bucyana is number 31 on the spelling list.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Madam Witness, are you able to confirm if the killing of these Hutu politicians -- moderate Hutu politicians further contributed in deteriorating the interethnic relationships? 
A.	I am unsure why you have introduced the term moderate Hutu.  In any case, Mr. Rwambuka was the bourgmestre of a commune in Bugesera notable for abuses of Tutsi, and for the killing of Tutsi in fairly large numbers.  I do not know that the label moderate Hutu is appropriate for someone against whom there exists a significant amount of information concerning abuses of Tutsi.  That label aside, it is certain that the assassination of politicians of whatever ethnic group contributes to destabilising a society and to increasing tensions.  
I would point out, however, that the general attribution, or the more -- shall we say -- the more widespread assumption that it was the RPF guilty of those three killings, is a more recent phenomenon, and to the best of my recollection at the time, was not one that was widely held.  It was alleged, but it was not -- to the best of my recollection -- a widely held conclusion that the RPF was guilty of those assassinations.  And in that sense, one could not conclude that it was the killing of those three men that contributed to an increase of hostility against the RPF or against the Tutsi as an ethnic group; that would be reading history backwards.  
Q.	Madam Witness, I shall not take that risk.  But those opinions, were they -- they were opinions of the observer, but the people themselves, don't they ascribe these killings to the enemy, the RPF, with all its possible assimilations?  
A.	Maître, it is always a matter of speculation what "the people" are believing at any given time.  I do not know that there was any attempt made to sample population and find out what people believed about these killings.  All I can tell you is that certainly there were some people, notably those associated with the MRND and the CDR, who believed that the RPF was guilty of these killings.  

It was not in my experience a conviction held by large numbers of people.  But I cannot say that I have carried out the studies necessary to confirm that.  It is simply my recollection from having been in Rwanda for certain periods of time during that period, and I do not recall it being the case that people were madly incensed against the RPF because of these killings.  
Q.	Madam Witness, what was the impact of the killing of the Hutu or to -- the democratically elected Hutu president in -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We could not get the date -- 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	But the impact of that on interethnic relations in Rwanda?
A.	For several reasons --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you repeat the date just for the record, please?  Did you say October '93?  
MR. CANTIER:
That was correct, Mr. President.  
THE WITNESS:
There, the case is much clearer for several reasons.  First of all, Melchior Ndadaye, N-D-A-D-A-Y-E, had been a refugee in Rwanda for several years, and was well known to many Rwandan political figures.  So he had the -- his -- his killing evoked consternation, anger, sorrow among people who were personally acquainted with him.  

Secondly, unlike the other cases you have mentioned of assassination, Ndadaye had been chosen in a generally acknowledged to be free and fair election, after a campaign which was run relatively free of ethnic connotations, and this was a cause of considerable reassurance and pride to many Hutu.  

Thirdly, the impact of his assassination was considerably increased by a deliberate propaganda campaign of distortion and exaggeration carried on by propaganda organs associated with the MRND and the CDR, in particular, Radio RTLM, which, in effect, told its listeners that Ndadaye had been castrated.  This was a message of enormous emotional impact because of the historical practice of Rwandan kings of castrating their defeated -- castrating defeated enemy rulers against whom they had fought.  

Fourthly, the -- and I -- I would -- it is important to point out that Ndadaye was not castrated; that a medical autopsy was done by a highly respected forensic physician, and the results of his examination showed that Ndadaye had been killed by several blows of a sharp instrument, most likely a bayonet, but that his body had not been in any way mutilated.  Fourthly, it was apparent that Ndadaye had been killed by Tutsi military officers.  So the combination of those four elements necessarily increased the impact, one reinforcing the other, so that the killing of Ndadaye did, indeed, push much further the polarisation of the political scene within Rwanda.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Was the assassination of President Habyarimana planned, Madam Witness? 
A.	(Microphones overlapping)... against to that is clear.  One does not go out on a hillside with weapons for shooting down an aeroplane on a whim.  Obviously it required planning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It has happened on a couple of occasions now, since you are listening to the original, that we lose the first part of your answer.  Thank you.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	In the first analysis, from mainly historians, this assassination was part and parcel of the planning of the Rwandan genocide; am I correct? 
A.	There were some historians and other commentators who reached that conclusion.  There were others of us who took a position of simply not knowing, and saying that regardless of who committed that crime, that the genocide itself put into effect a plan for violence against Tutsi.  
Q.	Madam Witness, do you deem this event to be the event that triggered the genocide? 
A.	That has been my conclusion for many years, and I have published that position beginning, at least, in 1999.  
Q.	Madam, according to you, who were those behind this assassination? 
A.	I have no special sources of information beyond what is available to the general public.  I have, of course, read the accounts of Ruzibiza and others.  I have followed Ruzibiza's testimony here and his interview subsequently.  I have read the decision of Judge Bruguière.  Based on that information, it seems to me likely that it was the RPF that carried out that attack.  I would stress that in my mind it is of ultimate importance for this Tribunal or another recognised international body to issue an appropriate statement based upon serious investigation in order that all doubt may be removed as to the author of that crime.  
Q.	Madam, and since I am addressing an historian, did you read Mr. Ruzibiza's book which refers not only to the RPF strategy for the conquest of power, but also the assassination of the president of the republic? 
A.	As I indicated in my previous answer, Maître, I have read Ruzibiza's book, I have followed his testimony at the ICTR, and I have read subsequent statements by him as reported in the press.  
Q.	Still addressing the historian that you are, you have observed that the book written by Mr. Ruzibiza came with a foreword by Mrs. Claudine Vidal, a researcher at CNRS -- Vidal being spelt V-I-D-A-L -- 
a foreword which covered 52 pages, and this same book is also concluded by your colleague, 
Mr. André Guichaoua; am I correct? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	Madam Witness, did those who plan this assassination -- or, rather, were those who planned this assassination aware of the consequences this would have in Rwanda from the interethnic standpoint? 
A.	Maître, as I have replied to your previous similar question concerning the beginning of the war in October 1990, I have myself no inside knowledge of what may or may not have been the discussions.  However, in this case, we do have the testimony of General Dallaire recounting conversations which he had with General Kagame, and which appear to substantiate the conclusion that the RPF was well aware of the likely consequences for interethnic relations of the -- of an eventual assassination of President Habyarimana.  
Q.	I note, Madam Witness, that you expressed the wish that this Tribunal or any other international body investigate on the circumstances under which two presidents of the republic were assassinated.  How can you explain that such a request was not made earlier and supported by international organisations working for the defence of human rights? 
A.	Maître, the demand for an international inquiry by an appropriate judicial body has been made repeatedly over the years, not just by international organisations, not just by various Rwandan parties, but by organs of the United Nations itself, including the Security Council.  

In the light of all that, it is certainly difficult to understand why such an inquiry has not taken place.  And, I can say only that I myself -- I find myself in accord with the original prosecutor of this Tribunal, Richard Goldstone, when he says, in his point of view, this crime falls within the mandate of the Tribunal.  

I know from discussions with various lawyers that there are technical points of international law which can be used and have been used to explain why it is not appropriate for this Tribunal -- or why this crime does not fall within its mandate.  However, it appears to me, as a layperson, that these are technical issues which can be read one way or the other -- depending upon considerations that have nothing to do with the law.  And it appears to me that it is those considerations which have determined the result thus far.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could we have your sentence repeated:  "I find myself in ..." and then I think we lost something with the original prosecutor of the Tribunal.  Can you just repeat exactly what you said?  
THE WITNESS:
I believe I said I find myself in accord - or, perhaps in agreement.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. CANTIER:
No, Mr. President, my assistant was, in fact, giving me the transcript of a statement to read with regard to what the witness has just stated.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Madam Witness, if those who ordered that such an assassination be committed were aware of its consequences, why did they not hesitate to perpetrate it? 
A.	Maître, that is a matter of speculation.  I have, as I pointed out, no sources of information on that topic.  It is something which persons other than myself are best able to answer.  If I am to speculate, I would perhaps conclude that although it was imaginable -- and on the basis of information that they probably had, even highly likely, that there would be violence against Tutsi as a result of any such attack.  But it is my understanding now that it would have been highly unlikely for anyone, whether from the side of the RPF or the side of the MRND, CDR to have imagined the full scale of the violence that would develop.  

In other words, they may well have imagined -- and, again, I insist that this is speculation -- they may well have imagined a somewhat briefer period of killing with far fewer casualties, and perhaps also imagined or even believed likely that there would be an international intervention to cut short any such killing.  

In that sense, if that, in fact, were the train of their thought, they obviously must have been -- they were mistaken, and have perhaps since had cause to understand how very seriously mistaken they were about any willingness on the part of the international community to intervene to protect civilians.  
Q.	Madam Witness, could the RPF not be aware of the plans that were being hatched by the powers? 
A.	Given what is generally acknowledged about the extent and quality of the information gathering apparatus of the RPF, it would appear to me highly unlikely that they were unaware of the plans for violence against Tutsi.  To what extent they were aware, of course, is not clear.  But that they were aware of some such plan, yes, I believe that would have been the case.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your question, Maître, referred to plans hatched by those in power in Rwanda at that time.  Wasn't that the question, and that was the answer given by the expert?  Can you just confirm that that was your question? 
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, indeed, it was exactly my question, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Madam Witness, did you know Mr. Renzaho before the events of 1994? 
A.	(Microphones overlapping)... it is not impossible that I met Mr. Renzaho briefly during one of my times in Rwanda prior to 1994, but I must say I have no recollection of having met him.  
Q.	Had you heard about him, Madam Witness? 
A.	At what period, Maître?  Do you mean did I know of him by reputation prior to 1994 or since that time? 
Q.	Yes, indeed, Madam, I had given a time frame in my first question, I'm referring to the period prior to April of 1994.  
A.	I recall having had conversations in which his name was mentioned, yes, where people spoke of him before 1994.  
Q.	During such conversations, were you told whether he was a political activist? 
A.	To the best of my recollection, yes.  The remarks which I recall concerning him did, indeed, speak of his political engagement.  
Q.	Did you hear about his participation in the installation of the democratic process in Rwanda?  
A.	In fact, I must say that that is not what I recall, but I stress again that my sources of information were limited, and that I am myself working here on the basis of -- of limited recollection of those conversations.  I have not reviewed my notes recently from that period, and so I am reluctant to go far in drawing any conclusions.  
Q.	How is Mr. Renzaho considered today by the regime in power in Kigali? 
A.	I have no knowledge of that question.  I have never discussed Mr. Renzaho, to the best of my recollection, with anyone currently in power in Kigali.  
Q.	Madam Witness, what was the military and security situation in the town of Kigali on the 7th of April in the evening? 
A.	I assume by the evening of 7 April, you mean, after 4 p.m. in the afternoon?  If that is correct, then the situation was that combat had resumed, that the RPF forces -- already present in the city -- were engaged in combat with Rwandan government forces.  At the same time, there were active in the streets groups of militia, mostly Interahamwe, sometimes accompanied by members of the 
Rwandan armed forces, active in setting up barriers and in locating and killing civilians. 
Q.	On the 7th of April, in the evening, had the administration already lost control of part of the city? 
A.	I do not know in detail what was the effective situation of administration throughout the city, but to the best of my knowledge, there was not a part of the city at that point that was not under -- that was no longer controlled by the administrative hierarchy.  
Q.	Did the situation evolve during the weeks that followed? 
A.	Yes, of course, it did, with the -- particularly with the arrival in the city of RPF troops coming from the north, the city was under military attack from troops outside, as well as from those troops already resident in the city, and various portions of the city came under RPF control.  
Q.	Madam Witness, regarding Mr. Renzaho's trial, you must be aware that our concern -- the 
Trial Chamber's concern has to do with the situation prevailing in the city of Kigali, and this is why I asked you whether this state of war led to any population movements within the city of Kigali? 
A.	Yes, there were movements of population -- we touched on that question yesterday.  There were various kinds of movements of population.  In the first days, there were people who fled to churches, to mosques, and to other places where they hoped to find safety -- the stadium, hospitals and so on.  Subsequently, there were movements of population as people fled the city, particularly once the government itself had fled or had displaced its headquarters, shall we say, to Gitarama.  Others followed and this -- and an increasing stream throughout the month of May.  It appears that by late May, substantial portions of the city had been emptied of population.  
Q.	Madam Witness, what were the consequences of this war situation on the security situation in the city, according to you? 
A.	Obviously a place that is in a war zone is a place of insecurity. 
Q.	Did not -- did that war situation not contribute to unleashing passions? 
A.	It would be unreasonable to suppose otherwise, particularly, the emotion of fear which, in my interpretation in any case, was the predominant motivating force for many people.  But, in addition to that, other forces -- hatred, greed, opportunism -- yes, obviously, in such a situation many emotions are let loose.  That is one of the reasons why the responsibility on authorities is so great.  
Q.	And perhaps also, Madam Witness, of those who contributed to such a situation? 
A.	In any conflict, each party must take responsibility for its actions.  
Q.	Madam Witness, in the course of your research, were you able to assess the forces that were available in the town of Kigali for law enforcement purposes? 
A.	Maître, I did an analysis of those numbers based on the information available to me, which was published in Leave None to Tell the Story.  I must confess to a poor head for figures, and I don't have the book in front of me, so I would venture -- I would not venture to discuss them.  Perhaps, if you wish to deal with specific numbers, we could wait until after the pause, and I will bring a copy of the book and then I can speak with more certitude about this matter.  
Q.	My apologies, I trusted you to -- I trusted your memory too much, because I read your book and I must say I did not bring it with me.  
Madam, you explained to the Trial Chamber -- you stated that in Rwanda, the role of the national police force was, in fact, carried out by the national gendarmerie; am I correct? 
A.	The gendarmerie served the purpose of the national police force, yes.  
Q.	Madam Witness, was the gendarmerie also mobilised to engage in combat in the city of Kigali? 
A.	That is correct, the exact date, I believe, is subject to some debate, but certainly several days into the conflict, I would -- I believe in the -- the week beginning the week of April 11th, the forces of the gendarmerie were put at the disposition of the army.  
Q.	Further, in the early days, were the camps of gendarmerie -- the two gendarmerie camps in Kigali, were they not shelled by the RPF troops? 
A.	The RPF attacked one gendarmerie camp, I cannot say for sure that it attacked the second, but it did definitely attack one, yes, and was, as I recall, repelled.  
Q.	In those conditions, Madam Witness, what approximately was the number of troops that the gendarmerie -- the national gendarmerie should have in order to be able to carry out the task of the national police force? 
A.	(Microphones overlapping) ... Kigali or nationwide? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you repeat what you just said, please? 
THE WITNESS:
I asked for further precision in the question, whether or not the question referred to the city of Kigali or to the entire country of Rwanda.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	I'm always focussing my questions on Kigali town, Madam Witness.  
A.	Maître, with -- always with the reservation that I would wish to consult my book to be absolutely sure, my estimation would be 2- to 300.  
Q.	Madam Witness, still giving an estimate, what was the population present in Kigali between the 
6th of April and the 5th of July 1994? 
A.	The population in early April would have been approximately 250,000 persons, and then, obviously that diminished.  How fast it decreased, I could not say, but obviously by July, it would have been a much smaller number of people, presumably under 100,000 -- perhaps closer to 50,000, but that I have no sure basis for -- for going beyond that.  
Q.	In those figures, would you include refugees coming from all over the place, particularly from the neighbourhood of Kigali? 
A.	No, the estimate of 250,000 is based upon census figures, which would have been -- which would have reflected the residents of the city, not persons there temporarily seeking refuge.  If you are referring to the population, including those -- those numbers of persons, it would have been beyond 250,000, but exactly how many, I cannot say.  Were there 10,000 refugees, were there 20,000 refugees?  I don't know.  I doubt that there were many more than that.  
Q.	Madam, Witness, are you able to tell the Court the number of communal policemen who were available to Kigali town? 
A.	I don't know the number of communal police, but as I recall, there were 34 communal police for 
Butare -- assuming that there was something roughly proportional there, that would make the number for Kigali between 100 and 150.  
Q.	Madam Witness, would you know how the communal police was deployed in Kigali town? 
A.	The communal police were deployed generally at the instruction of the bourgmestres.  Do you mean were they employed in traffic control or some other duties?  That, I do not know.  
Q.	No, Madam Witness, what I'm seeking to know, if you can answer, is whether they were available to the bourgmestre -- to the conseiller de secteur and how they were deployed?  Centralised in Kigali-ville or whether they were distributed in the communes and the secteurs making up Kigali -- Kigali-ville préfecture? 
A.	(Microphones overlapping)
MR. PRESIDENT:
And now the answer, please? 
THE WITNESS:
As I said, in general, the communal police were at the disposition of the bourgmestres.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Where were they physically posted? 
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, I believe that most were at the communal offices, but it is likely that there were some as well in the central préfectoral office.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Madam Witness, do you know -- but, I'm all the same afraid that you might not be able to answer this question -- the fate of these municipal police force on the 7th of April, were they able to mobilise the entire force or were there deserters?  Have you conducted any research into that area? 
A.	I have not done research on this within the bounds of Kigali city.  Again, based on information from other parts of the country, communal police decreased in number during this period, at least, initially.  Some were killed because they were Tutsi; others fled because they were Tutsi.  But the losses, at least, in the southern part of the country represented perhaps one-fifth of the -- of the force.  But I stress that this is information drawn from other parts of the country, rather than peculiar to Kigali city.  
Q.	Madam Witness, I would like to put this to you for your confirmation:  Resolution 872 of the 
Security Council, dated 5th October 1993.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have that document in front of you there? 
THE WITNESS:
I do not, Your Honour.  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, we've distributed the two versions -- the English and the French.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the question? 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Item 3 of that resolution decides that, drawing from the Secretary General's recommendation, UNAMIR shall have the following mandate:  Paragraph A --" and, that is what I intend to emphasise for now -- "To contribute to the security of city of Kigali, inter alia, within a weapons secure area established by the parties in and around the city."

Madam Witness, you obviously must know this resolution, which was one of the enabling resolutions 
of -- from the United Nations. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now we have noted the substance of paragraph 3A, and what is the question?  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, by the production of this decision of the Security Council, I wanted to establish -- and also the agreement -- KWSA, that UNAMIR had a mandate to ensure law and security in Kigali town.  And then, I'll go on to ask a question -- or two questions to the witness on the presence of the UNAMIR in Kigali and the implementation of its mandate.  
THE WITNESS:
Maître, if I may, before we go further?  The document says that UNAMIR is to contribute to the security, not to assure the security, and this in fact becomes a central point of debate subsequently when General Dallaire is informed of weapons hidden in the city and wishes to seize those weapons.  He is forbidden to do so on the basis of that very distinction, which I have just made; namely, that it is not the mandate of UNAMIR to assure, but, rather, to contribute to.  These are fine distinctions, but ones that, in reality, carry the force of life and death.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	This subtlety is not lost on me, but all the same, UNAMIR was to contribute to ensuring that security.  
A.	Indeed, it was to contribute to the security in cooperation with Rwandan governmental authorities, and it was the inability of UNAMIR to rely upon an effective collaboration of Rwandan authorities that was, at least, partly responsible for its failure in the city.  
Q.	Madam Witness, I'd also like to put to you -- and the KWSA agreements on issues of security -- agreement dated 10th (sic) December 1993, which I have also distributed --  
MR. CANTIER:
Registry? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And did you now refer to a document dated the 20th of December? 
MR. CANTIER:
That is right, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. CANTIER:
I wish to refer to items -- paragraphs 4 and 5 of that document.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is too fast.  

All right, do we all have this document in front of us now? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, Your Honour, the French version. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Very good.  Now let us start reading slowly, paragraph 4, would you do that, Maître? 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	"The commander of the Kigali secteur" --
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, let me read the heading, "responsibilities", in plural.  

"The commander of the Kigali secteur is responsible for the setting up of the -- the Kigali secured -- weapons secured zone in collaboration with the national gendarmerie and the local police.  The infantry battalions and the battalions (sic) of the United Nations deployed in Kigali shall supply the troops or the personnel and will ensure control of the weapons secured area."
MR. PRESIDENT:
And under "5" there, I think the text refers to military observers of the United Nations; isn't that so? 
MR. CANTIER:
"The infantry battalions and military observers of the United Nations deployed in Kigali" -- the two.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Exactly.  Thank you.  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, the last reference -- and that is paragraph 8 of that agreement, which defines the weapons secure area:  "A zone within which the movement and use of forces, troops, weapons of 
which -- ever -- any -- any party shall be regulated by UNAMIR forces." 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Madam Witness, as far as you are concerned, what is your reading of the specific mandate of the UNAMIR with regard to maintenance of security and order in Kigali before knowing the manner in which it is interpreted? 
A.	Well, to begin with, Maître, this does not deal with the larger question of maintaining security; it deals with the very narrow question having to do with the placement of arms and the movement of troops.  
In that regard, the language is apparently subject to different interpretations.  My interpretation as a layperson would be quite simple:  That MINUAR had the responsibility for putting this 
weapons-free -- free zone in place with the help of the gendarmerie and the communal police, that is, that they would perhaps be equal partners, but that certainly a power of initiative would exist on the side of UNAMIR.  This was an interpretation explicitly rejected in New York when Dallaire attempted to implement this, based on an interpretation like that I have just presented.  
Q.	Madam Witness, what was the number of UNAMIR troops present in Kigali as of the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	I could not tell you the exact number.  The number in the country was somewhat less than 2,800.  There were troops stationed in the north -- a substantial number of them, perhaps 2,000, but again, I would have to verify this.  I believe I have the number in Leave None to Tell the Story, but I don't have it in front of me.  

In fact, come to think of it, it would have been much less than that -- now that I think about it, because the troops that were most responsible for Kigali city were the Belgians.  And the Belgians, as I recall, were 400 -- I believe, 400.  So, the number that we're looking at would then be considerably smaller.  There were the Bangladeshis -- no, I would really -- I would really have to -- to check those figures to be absolutely sure.  And I would ask perhaps for your patience in returning to this question after the break when I have the opportunity to have the book in front of me. 
MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, if I can assist?  I've just had someone go and fetch a copy of the book.  If my friend is happy for me to have the book put in front of Dr. Des Forges, then it may save us time later. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's very helpful, but it may still take time to find the exact page.  So, maybe we could just keep it close here in the courtroom and move on for the time being.  
MR. CANTIER:
I've also had mine brought, the French version.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Madam Witness, what was the role of the United Nations troops in the maintenance of security and order in Kigali? 
A.	In the first days, the UN forces attempted actively to save lives, rescued some people, assisted in the evacuation of others, provided protection at various points in the city.  That would have been roughly from April 6th or early April 7 through April 11 -- shall we say.  

Then, the retreat began with the announcement that the Belgian forces would leave, and with the decision in New York that the UN troops should play a much more restricted role.  In fact, they had been told as early as 8 April, I believe, not to allow civilians seeking protection to enter their quarters.  Some continued to allow such persons to enter their quarters, nonetheless.  But, the general account of their assistance was a very limited one and one which declined -- which became increasingly restricted, except for a few notable points.  

For example, at the Hôtel Mille Collines, where UN protection was actually increased after international attention was drawn to the plight of Tutsi who had sought shelter there, but in general, you could summarise it by saying precious little -- and even that decreased in time.

1030H 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  

Let me move on to another line of questioning.  On the issue that concerns us, the issue of Kigali préfecture and its préfet, Madam Witness, have you examined the tasks that in a general manner are to be discharged by the préfecture and its préfet? 
A.	I have a general knowledge, yes, of the tasks of the prefect and the work done by the préfecture.  
Q.	Are you able to recall these, briefly? 
A.	Speaking of the prefect, his task would have been primarily to implement government programmes; to assure the delivery of mandated services; to ensure public order; to assist the authorities of the judicial system in carrying out the implementation of laws; the -- to oversee the provision of various bureaucratic measures, having to do with the keeping of records and the registration of population.  In short, he was the chief executive authority for the administration within his jurisdiction. 
Q.	The maintenance of cleanliness and hygiene, was that part of the duties of Kigali-ville préfecture? 
A.	Yes.  That would be encompassed, I would suppose, in the category of delivering services, necessary services, to the population.  
Q.	As of the 6th of April 1994, and in the light of the events, what were the specific tasks that were carried out by the préfecture? 
A.	I'm sorry.  I don't understand that question.  Could you be more specific, please?  
Q.	From the 6th of April 1994 onwards, and given the situation prevailing in Kigali, did the -- was the préfecture not entrusted with other tasks to carry out?  And I'm thinking more specifically of the problems of supply and foodstuffs and water.  
A.	Judging from the concerns reflected in the prefect's public pronouncements on the radio, the provision of food certainly was among his concerns.  In addition was, of course, the implementation of the programme known as civilian self-defence.  I would say that those two perhaps -- and controlling looting and -- and pillaging, would have represented areas of activity that consumed the major part of his attention, if one is to judge from the kinds of comments available to us from radio broadcasts.  
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness. 

Were you able to carry out research on the fate of the préfectoral administration after the 
7th of April 19 -- after the 6th of April 1994, or was there a reduction in the number of staff?  Were some of the staff members killed?  Do you have a specific idea of the situation that prevailed at the Kigali-ville préfecture on the 7th of April in the morning? 
A.	(Microphones overlapping)...precise knowledge but, rather, a general -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And now -- and now the answer, please.  
THE WITNESS:
I do not have a precise knowledge of the numbers involved, but, in general, certainly there would have been a reduction in the numbers of persons available, in part because some had been killed, in part because others had fled or were in hiding.  This conclusion is based upon the radio announcements, for example, calling for people to return to work, seeking particular persons who were needed, all of which suggests that it was a situation where not all members of the administration were present and fully functioning.
BY MR. CANTIER:  
Q.	Were you able to determine, Madam Witness, whether the administration of Kigali-ville préfecture was able to operate in a satisfactory manner and provide services to the citizens during that period? 
A.	Clearly, the administration was not functioning normally.  Nothing functions normally in a wartime crisis situation.  Was it performing satisfactorily?  That, I think, must be judged by the objectives which were given priority and how resources were used.  In any time of crisis, persons in authority must make choices, where to invest their personnel, where to invest their petrol, what to do. 

In the -- in considering the objective of searching out and eliminating Tutsi, in that perspective, I think one would judge this administration as having performed satisfactorily, according to the objectives of those who established a desire to eliminate Tutsi.  

According to other objectives, were the objective to be, for example, the protection of all civilians resident in the city, regardless of ethnicity, then, obviously, one would have to judge its performance as unsatisfactory.  
Q.	What was the role of the préfet in the Rwandan administration, Madam Witness? 
A.	As I said, Maître, the préfet was the chief executive officer, the implementer, the head administrative authority in the préfecture. 
Q.	Did you not write and regularly state before this Tribunal that the main role in the administration was entrusted to the bourgmestre? 
A.	I do not recall having made such a statement.  I recall having said that, in terms of the ordinary life of people, the bourgmestre was the authority closer to them and more directly and intimately concerned with issues of their daily lives, such as admission to schools, provision of land, questions of that nature.  I do not believe I have ever said that the bourgmestre was a more important authority than the prefect. 
Q.	That was not my suggestion either, but I had taken note of what you just confirmed to us, that is to say, that the bourgmestre was closer to the population and had regular interactions with the population. 

Madam, was it the case of the bourgmestre of the main commune of Kigali, Nyarugenge? 
A.	I'm sorry, Maître, I didn't understand the question.  
Q.	My question was to determine whether the bourgmestre -- the bourgmestre of the main commune of Kigali town, the Nyarugenge commune, was also very close to the population and whether the population would go to him first when it had problems.  
A.	The urban situation is obviously different from the rural circumstances in which well over 90 per cent of Rwandans lived.  My conclusions having to do with the proximity of bourgmestres to the population is based, rather, upon the rural model than the urban model.  Whether this was equally true, that is to say, the importance or the proximity of the bourgmestre in the daily life of persons in his area of responsibility, whether that was equally true for the three communes of Kigali city, I do not know.  

I would suppose that, yes, in many circumstances the bourgmestre would have been the authority to whom people ordinarily turned first, but perhaps the existence of the préfecture in near proximity somewhat changed that relationship.  That would have been very different from the rural communes, where a trip to the préfecture ordinarily meant a considerable displacement.  
Q.	And, Madam Witness, in this organisation, the link with the lower rungs, that is to say, the secteur, the conseiller de secteur, the conseiller de cellule, the nyamukubi (sic) -- nyambakumi, was it also -- was that link also through the bourgmestre? 
A.	In ordinary circumstances, Rwandans are very scrupulous about observing hierarchical lines.  There are occasions, however, and we have seen that in one of the radio transcripts we have looked at in this trial, where the prefect is apparently speaking directly to the conseiller.  So I would suppose that, in certain circumstances, particularly in a situation of wartime where the prefect is himself resident in the city, that there may have been some deviations from usual practice, and the prefect may have, in fact, been more directly in contact with conseiller than would have been normal bureaucratic practice in situations of peace and in the countryside.  
Q.	Madam Witness, did you know the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge? 
A.	I do not know either the current bourgmestre or the person who was bourgmestre in 1994. 
Q.	Madam Witness, you stated in your testimony, as well as in your report, that the appeals of the préfet to put an end to the killings, the lootings, the rapes, were not complied with.  And, for that purpose, you quote -- or, you mention a testimony -- and I'm looking for the reference -- so it is taken from your report, and it's French version on page 17 under the heading "Double Language and Deception."  And the quote I'm about to make is in the last but one paragraph of this chapter.  
MR. CANTIER:
In order to enable you to locate the excerpt in the English version, Mr. President, it is, in fact, the chapter on operational civil defence, and it's two paragraphs prior to that one.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Anything you want to read or highlight to the witness?  
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  Mr. President, I have already stated the beginning of my statement, and it was merely to say that that sentence, "In spite of the -- despite Renzaho's call for arresting and prosecuting wrongdoers, one of his subordinates has testified that Renzaho failed to act when he indicated persons who should have been arrested for such crimes as murder."

And then there is a footnote, footnote number 38, and we see under footnote 38 "Radio Rwanda broadcast, May 19th, ICTR document --" I won't mention the K-number -- "and testimony of Witness BU in the trial of Karemera, et al.," March 8th, 2006, pages 35 to 38 in the English version.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	And my question, Radio Rwanda, the programme of the 18th of May, was looked at during the examination-in-chief, at least excerpts of it, and I would like to insist on Witness BU.

Madam Witness, did you meet with that witness, BU? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Can you please slow down.  

So let's take that question again.  What was the question?  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Madam Witness, did you meet Witness BU? 
A.	Before addressing the question, I would like to say that, in your preamble, you said that I had asserted that measures had had no effect.  And you listed a series of measures, including pillage.  In fact, I have testified based on -- on radio broadcasts that measures against pillage did have an effect.  And I drew the contrast between that and measures against killing of Tutsi, in particular.  

On your specific question, I do not know who Witness BU is.  I know him only by his protected code, BU, and by the content of his testimony, which made clear that he was, in fact, **************************.  Beyond that, I know nothing of Witness BU. 
Q.	So you did not interview him yourself and simply relied on his statements before the 
	International Criminal Tribunal? 
A.	The footnote is clear.  
Q.	But this was a protected witness, madam.  
A.	Indeed.  That is why I said I have no knowledge of this person other than his coded initials.  I do not believe I have met this person, but I do not know that for a fact, since I do not know the person's identity.  But, to the best of my recollection, ************************** of Prefect Renzaho in 1994 whom I did, in fact, know and interview, is deceased.  
Q.	Are you aware that this person was sentenced to death, for perpetrating a genocide in Rwanda, on one first occasion in 1997, a death sentence which was confirmed by the Kigali court of appeals in 1998, and that since then that person has appealed to the supreme court, an appeal which to this day has not been reviewed? 
A.	As I have said, Maître, I know only the pseudonym of this person.  I do not know the details of his judicial history.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And when reading the transcripts from the Karemera trial of Witness BU, this issue was not covered.  
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, it may have been discussed, but all I can say is, if I read it, I did not retain that information.  I recognise that it is frequently the case that witnesses appearing at this Tribunal have a judicial record of one kind or another.  And if there were -- unless there were something particularly to draw my attention to that fact, I may have read it and not retained it.  But what I can say now is that, to the best of my recollection, I do not know his judicial history.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Madam Witness, I was wondering about the reliability of your sources, on the basis of which you made a serious statement concerning one individual.  

My next question deals with the means available to the Kigali town préfecture and its préfet to face up to the events as of the 7th of April 1994 in the morning.  
A.	I'm sorry.  Is the -- is there a question there?  Is the question you are asking me to comment on the reliability of my sources in assessing the comportment of the préfecture on April the 6th or after?  I'm sorry.  Was that -- was that your intent to ask me that? 
Q.	No, Madam.  I was moving on to a different matter.  I made an observation and then went to the following question:  Would you be in a position to assess what were the means available to the Kigali-ville préfecture to face up to the situation that prevailed in Kigali on the 7th of April in the morning? 
A.	It is only reasonable to acknowledge, and I believe I have already acknowledged, that resources were limited in the face of a situation of dire crisis.  The issue is not whether or not the administration was fully equipped.  That clearly was not the case.  The question is what did the administration do with the resources that were available.  And for this I have already given my answer.  
Q.	Madam Witness, to revisit the issue of impunity that you underscored, and for which you levelled accusations on Mr. Renzaho and relying on BU's testimony, what was the situation of the judicial apparatus in Kigali from the 7th of April 1994? 
A.	In April and for the best part of May, as far as I understand it, the judicial system was not functioning, at least not in a normal sense.  This did not make it impossible, however, for authorities to detain persons, particularly those caught in -- in flagrant commission of crimes as serious as murder and rape.  It would have been possible under those circumstances, and, indeed, in some places it did happen, that authorities arrested people for such crimes.  And, in fact, Prefect Renzaho, according to his own statement on radio, was able to act in three cases having to do, I believe, with the crime of rape or pillage, but not killings.  
So his powers may have been -- and his resources, rather than his powers, may have been restricted, but they were not in -- nonexistent.  
Q.	But, Madam Witness, when Préfet Renzaho wished to have somebody arrested and arrested that person, what was he to do with that individual? 
A.	Are you asking what would have been the physical facilities available for detention, or are you asking what would have been the legal procedure to be followed?  
Q.	Madam, the préfectoral authority could arrest individuals and was then to refer such arrested people to the judicial system.  That was the purpose of my question.  
A.	You are correct, Maître.  And, as a person professionally involved in the defence of human rights, under ordinary circumstances the failure to present a detained person in appropriate ways and an appropriate time period before a magistrate would be a cause of serious concern.  In the midst of a genocide, I think even the strictest among defenders of human rights would be prepared to make exceptions in order to bring genocidal killers to a halt. 
Q.	Madam Witness, what were the measures that should have been taken?  Imprisonment?  Of course, no summary execution, but imprisonment?  
A.	Influencing the behaviour of large numbers of people, particularly once they are engaged in killings and other conduct which is bringing them profit, is obviously difficult.  In such circumstances, ordinarily the arrest of several leaders can have a singularly beneficial effect on the conduct of others.  Had the prefect wished to control these killings and had he arrested Interahamwe leaders instead of sitting down to discuss with them, it might have been possible to bring the violence against Tutsi under relatively rapid control.  

Of course, we do not know that that would have been the result, and we cannot know now because that was not the choice he made.  The choice he made was, rather, to continue discussing, collaborating, thanking, and encouraging those, quote, unquote, youth leaders for their activities.  And because of that we do not know whether he could or could not have effectively stopped their killing.  Certainly refraining from congratulating them would have been a first step and would not have required any resources.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could this be a good moment for the break, Maître?  
MR. CANTIER:
(Microphone not activated)...yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And during the break we will partly look at the book.  And then I noted the discussion about footnote 38 between Defence counsel and the expert witness, and there there are two references:  One was the testimony of Witness BU, which we discussed, and the other one was a Radio Rwanda broadcast dated May 19th.  

Now we have in our transcripts binder two 19th of May transcripts.  It appears that the closest one will be possibly P. 65, but it seems to me that the K-numbers there starts after the reference in footnote 38.  So if that could be clarified during the break as to whether we have that documentation available in the file or whether we do not have it.  

And now the 20 minutes.  The Court is adjourned.  
(Court recessed from 1100H to 1129H)
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  That was my last question in this line of questioning.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Madam Des Forges, what was the situation of the prison administration during that period, since we've been talking about arrests and imprisonment, detention? 
A.	If I might first take the opportunity to clear up the question of the footnote, the reason the page didn't correspond is that I was using it -- that was the Kinyarwanda page of the transcript.  The corresponding K-number for the French would be K0369077.  
Q.	Madam Witness, are you referring to the transcripts of the radio programme? 
A.	(Microphones overlapping)...I was responding to Judge Møse's question before the break, where he had asked me to verify the K-number of a footnote.  So I was simply responding to that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that's very kind of you.  Thank you.  I now just didn't want to interrupt Defence counsel.  But since we are here now, if we then look at tab 13, where we find this document, does this then mean that the passage that you are referring to in the footnote is included in the binder? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 

So now I have an answer to my question before the break, and then there was the issue from Defence counsel.  
THE WITNESS:
Which, I must say, I have not had time to discover.  It took me a while to do the other.  So perhaps we can postpone that one till after lunch. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And when it comes to the penitentiary situation?  
THE WITNESS:
The -- within the first day or two, the prison -- the main prison was opened, and some, if not all, of the prisoners were released or fled.  In addition to the main prison, however, which may or may not have been officially guarded, each commune, and, in fact, each secteur, has a lockup in which people can be kept, so that having at his disposition communal police and gendarmes, surely a very small number of them, perhaps four or six, would have sufficed to turn almost any locked, or lockable, location into a place of detention for killers.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	And now, regarding the Kigali-ville préfecture, do you have any specific information to give the Chamber regarding that? 
A.	About the number of lockups, apart from the central prison?  Is that your question?  
Q.	Yes.  More specifically, in Kigali-ville préfecture.  
A.	There would have been certainly detention facilities, or holding cells might perhaps be a better way to express it, at the communes and at the secteur level.  I have myself been in a number of these places, and they did not have the appearance of being constructed prior -- after 1994.  So I assume that they were in existence at that time as well.  
Q.	Madam Witness, you told the Court a while ago that the bourgmestre also had the authority of policing and maintaining law and order.  To your knowledge, did they exercise this? 
A.	I don't, in fact, recall having said that, but I would not make it a point of contention.  

Certainly bourgmestres, in association with OPJ, could locate and detain persons accused.  I have not followed the conduct of bourgmestres.  I have not had the request to do that nor the resources to do that for Kigali-ville. 
Q.	Madam Witness, could they also require -- or, call on the gendarmerie? 
A.	(Microphones overlapping)...the bourgmestre requisition the gendarmerie?  Is that the question?  
Q.	That is the point.  
A.	To the best of my recall, a bourgmestre could, for a short period, subject to later written confirmation.  But, in any case, his power to do so was certainly less than that of the prefect. 
Q.	Madam Witness, yesterday you elaborated on the issue of double language and ambiguity of statements and assertions made by Mr. Renzaho in radio programmes.  Yesterday the Prosecutor used excerpts, and Mr. Renzaho dwelt extensively on issues that were current.  
A.	It was clear to me from reading the transcripts available, which I suppose do not represent the totality of broadcasts during this period, but certainly, to judge from the number that are extant, the prefect did indeed express himself at length on many occasions.  
Q.	So, Madam Witness, this is more of a discussion than a speech? 
A.	There were several different contexts, as I recall.  On some occasions it was an interview situation.  On other occasions it appears to have been a more formal speech.  And on at least one occasion, which I believe I indicated yesterday, it appears that it -- his -- his discourse was recorded as part of a meeting being held, I believe, with the counselors. 
Q.	You seem to base your assertion of double language on the fact that the préfet, most of his speeches was at this -- one and the same time inciting to violence, while mobilising the population against the enemy.  Is that correct? 
A.	That is one basis.  Another basis has to do with the difference between what he said and what he did.  
Q.	Madam Witness, was it not a situation of war, a de facto situation of war, that prevailed in Kigali that led to this kind of language? 
A.	Certainly we must understand the speeches, or other expressions, as words said in a context of war.  It would not be fair to do otherwise.  But those words must also be understood in the context of massive slaughter of unarmed civilians, chosen on an ethnic basis, slaughter which was well known to authorities.  So if the context of war is to be considered, the context of genocide must also be considered.  
Q.	But, nonetheless, Mr. Renzaho, without interpreting his speeches, could legitimately mobilise the population to fight the enemy.  
A.	Maître, we have already discussed this point.  To the extent that the prefect mobilised resources, human, armament, other resources, to enable citizens to confront armed combatants, part of an enemy force that threatened imminent danger to those persons, this was a legitimate activity.  

To the extent that he provided resources, offered encouragement, gave orders which led to the use of those resources to hunt down and kill unarmed combatants, chosen on a basis of ethnicity, persons who deserved under international law the full protection of government authorities, to the extent that he permitted and encouraged the use of resources under his control for the killing of Tutsi civilians, that is not a legitimate activity.  It is a violation of international law.  
Q.	Madam Witness, your reading of these speeches, or these statements, was it not been -- were you not looking at them through your own conviction -- or, your own initial conviction of a willful and planned genocide? 
A.	My reading of his words is in the -- or, through the prism of the reality of events.  It is through the -- and in light of the fact of the massive slaughter of innocent civilians in a jurisdiction under his administration at a time when some of the resources of that administration were being used to carry out those very killings.  It is in the light of that which I interpret his words. 
Q.	But then, Madam Witness, are you not running counter to the principle that you stated yesterday, that is, not to read history backwards?  In other words, are you not starting from the results to proceed to the intentions? 
A.	That could, indeed, be a legitimate criticism if my judgement were one formed after the fact, based on knowledge after the fact.  Such is not the case.  The effect of his words was immediate and visible, not simply to me as an outside observer, but to him and to his associates.  

And if I make an interpretation, it is not that of a historian imposing a retroactive judgement.  It is a conclusion drawn from the situation that existed at the time of his discourse and with his full knowledge.  It is not my judgement from the past, but it is my conclusion based on what he was doing, given his own knowledge of the situation in the city.  
Q.	And yet, Madam Witness, you told the Court yesterday that your current analysis has evolved and that you relied on recent discoveries that you made, more specifically through the study of a document of February 1994 on a civil defence system.  
A.	Of course, my understanding of organisational aspects has developed with the availability of new documents.  But that is a question quite apart from evaluating what was known by the actors at the time and establishing a judgement about the possible courses of action open to them and the actions they did take.  It is not necessary to know of the existence of the February 1994 document in order to reach a judgement about the way the préfet used his resources, including his words, his authority, and his legitimacy, at the time.  
Q.	Madam Witness, that leads -- takes me to the issue of civil defence system.  Was it a new concept which was implemented for the first time in 1994 in Rwanda? 
A.	I am not a student of military history, as such, but I am sure that the strategy of what could be called civilian self-defence is one well established, even centuries or millennia in the past.  There is nothing new about the concept. 
Q.	Very concisely, Madam Witness, what did it involve, concretely? 
A.	I would define it as the mobilisation of civilians, their training, and their -- the distribution of necessary material, including arms, to them in order to enable them to combat a -- an enemy as defined under international law, that is to say, a combatant force, armed and posing imminent threat to their lives. 
Q.	And do you think that the recourse to such a system from 1992, 1993 will be illegitimate, taking into account the prevailing situation in Rwanda? 
A.	Maître, we have addressed this question several times.  Do you really want to hear it again?  I'm quite happy to give you, once again, my explanation for exactly why this was an illegitimate and illegal use of the authority of Rwandan officials.  But do you really want to hear that again?  
Q.	Madam Witness, my question was specific:  The idea of having recourse to the civilian self-defence system from the beginning, was it legitimate?  I'm aware of what you said subsequently.  
A.	For those who engaged in the planning and organisation of this effort, with the intention that it be used against an armed combatant force, as properly defined under international law, it would not have been illegitimate.  
Q.	Was it a very covert operation, that is, the establishment of the civil self-defence system in Rwanda? 
A.	The documents I have seen relating to the organisation of this programme are, indeed, stamped "very secret" or, in one case, "confidential."  Prime Minister Kambanda asserts that he, himself, did not have possession of the February 1994 document until well after he had lost power.  

Officers of the national gendarmerie requested to be informed of the plan, because they understood that such a plan existed, in February 1994, and they were refused, that is, officers of the general staff of the gendarmerie, so, in other words, very high-ranking officers.  To me, this would suggest -- as well, of course, is the fact that apparently the prime minister was not to be informed -- this would suggest that the planning was held within a very circumscribed set of people.  
Q.	Do you know who was the chief of the intelligence service in the years 1993-1994? 
A.	Are you speaking of the military intelligence service or the civilian intelligence service?  
Q.	Military and civilian intelligence services, but, more specifically, the name of the chief of civilian intelligence who worked under the prime minister.  
A.	Yes.  Well, that would not have been the person in charge of military intelligence, which was quite a separate operation.  The person in charge under the prime minister's office was, I believe, Augustin Iyamuremye, I-Y-A-M-U-R-E-M-Y-E. 
Q.	Which party did he belong to? 
A.	I believe he was a member of the MDR, possibly the PSD, but I think the MDR.   
Q.	I put it to you, Madam Witness, that he was a member of the PSD.  Are you ready to accept that? 
A.	Yes, actually, come to think of it, I think you are correct.  I think it was the PSD and not the MDR. 
Q.	And you believe that the established -- establishment of this system from February 1994 could have gone on without the knowledge of the intelligence service? 
A.	I don't know the quality of the intelligence service attached to the prime minister's office and whether it would have been reasonable or unreasonable to expect them to be aware of this plan.  My speculation would be that they should have had a general sense of what was happening, but I have no particular information about that.  
Q.	Madam Witness, the letter addressed to Major-General Déogratias Nsabimana to the minister of defence, December 1994, that is, Exhibit P. 24 of the exhibits of the -- Prosecution exhibits.  I'm referring to Exhibit P. 24 -- I shall be referring to Exhibits P. 24 and P. 25.  
MR. CANTIER:
Unfortunately, Mr. President, I have only one copy of the original document written in French.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	My question, Madam Witness, is to know if this letter is the follow-up of this document of 
	February 1994.  
A.	I believe it would have been, yes, the -- the natural follow-up because the concern with the arms to be distributed, the concern with the listing of reservists resident in the various neighbourhoods, would have been exactly in line with what was called for and requested in the February document.  
Q.	Madam Witness, and I'm referring to items 4 and 6 of this correspondence -- 
MR. CANTIER:
Which I shall read out again, Mr. President, item 4, "The operational cells set up will receive the mission of the OPS commander town (sic) for the defence, first of all, of their neighbourhood and then for the hunting down and neutralisation of the infiltrators in the different neighbourhoods of the city." 

Item 6, "For people to know one another and be aware of their mission, the OPS commander of Kigali town shall organise meetings of the civilians and soldiers concerned in the camps that will be closer to the places of residence and will provide operational directives to them."
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Madam, does that not clearly mean that the civilian defence system came directly under the responsibility of the army? 
A.	That is obviously a question of great importance, and I must say I was surprised to find in the transcript of 18 June a clear statement that the civilian self-defence system is to be under a single head and it is to be a military officer.  That is the 18th of June, and I believe was likely subsequent to a later decision, confining the civilian self-defence system under exclusive military control, probably as a result of the critical situation of the city at that time.  

Certainly throughout otherwise, the emphasis is on a joint effort between civilian and military officers and officials.  Such is the clear description in the February 1994 document.  Such is the clear description in the May 25th documents, that is, the order of the prime minister and the order of the minister of interior, where they describe a joint system of control between ministry of defence and ministry of interior.  

And here you will see in the paragraph 4 that you read, and as well in paragraph 1, which you did not read, the emphasis upon the cellule.  And if I may read the paragraph 1, "The cellule was selected as being an organisational entity, which is the equivalent of a section.  On the basis of such a criterion, the OPS town commander will organise -- will set up a plan for the organisation of the soldiers who live outside, cellule by cellule." 

(Microphones overlapping)...that it is the civilian zone of residence which is to be the basic unit of the system.  And it said clearly that the cellule, a civilian category, is to be the -- the equivalent of a section, a section being a military category.  So there you have, I believe, clearly encapsulated the nature of the effort.  

In addition, if you look to the facts of how the system is carried out, the crisis committees established at the order of the prefect are civilian committees, and they are given authority over the local operation of the system.  It's only later on, when the military situation becomes critical, that is to say, in the month of June, that the military hierarchy apparently has said, "Enough of this.  We're going to take control completely and run this as an integrated part of our military operation."  But by the 18th of June when that announcement is made by the prefect, of course, the vast majority of Tutsi have been killed.  

And just as a point of interest, in response, again, to your earlier question about how secret the system was, you will see this document is stamped at its bottom "very secret."  

There is also the point that the response to this letter comes from the préfet.  If this is a militarily run system from start to finish, why do we need the préfet involved in helping to provide the organisational apparatus?
Q.	Madam Witness, were the préfets not involved simply because they were required to refer to the chief of staff of the Rwandan army -- or, sent to the -- to them the lists of the people who could be integrated in the civilian defence system?  Was that not their specific role? 
A.	The préfet appears, through the radio transcripts and through the facts, as the linchpin of the system.  He is the point of interface between military officers and the civilian administration.  He tells the civilian administrators in one of the radio broadcasts, "I have been meeting with the military chiefs, and here is what has been decided."  

On the other hand, he is the linchpin between the administrative system and the political parties.  And we see -- through the transcripts of the radio, we see him meeting the heads of the political parties and conveying the conclusions of that meeting to the civilian administration.  So he is a person at the locus point, upon which the rest of the system turns.  
Q.	Madam Witness, that is what you stated yesterday, and it's your own analysis, but in the specific case in point, we are referring to the setting up of the civilian defence system.  And the answer provided by Mr. Renzaho, to be more specific, to the letter that was sent to him by the chief of staff, with the assistance of the administrative apparatus consisted in addressing -- 
MR. CANTIER:
And this is Exhibit P. 25, Mr. President, Your Honours.
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	So Renzaho addressed a very brief letter to the chief of staff:  "Dear sir:  Within the framework of popular defence, I have the honour to transmit to you the list of persons, reservists, and others chosen -- selected per cellule for the purpose of civilian defence.  Other lists will follow."  

So this is what I note.  What do you say to that, Madam Witness? 
A.	You are correct, Maître, in summarising this letter and in indicating that it demonstrates the role of the prefect in this instance, this single instant, as being that of providing assistance in organising the operation of the civilian self-defence system.  But I certainly do not believe, and I don't expect that even you believe, that his activities ceased on the 31st of March when he wrote this letter.  This is but a very small part of what we're addressing.  
Q.	Madam Witness, I'm referring to the documents that were entered into evidence by the Prosecution on the specific subject of the setting up of civilian defence, or popular (sic) defence, in Kigali.  And I note you gave your opinion on the matter that the préfet, because he is the link between the military authorities and the population, was entrusted with this role as a recruiter, which he executed by sending lists to the military authorities.  
A.	Absolutely.  We're in agreement that he plays the role of helping to recruit and organise for civilian self-defence as a result of an exchange of correspondence 30 March and 31st of March.  There is no question about that.  The question is what did he do afterwards. 
Q.	And, Madam Witness, do you believe that, in the light of the events that occurred in the days that followed, the setting up of a cumbersome and complex system was possible? 
A.	I don't know how heavy or complex the system was.  It was certainly effective, however else you want to describe it.  It was there, and it worked.  It did what it was supposed to do.  
Q.	You testified yesterday that at a given point in time there was a merger or a confusion between the militia groups and civilian defence.  When exactly did this merger take place? 
A.	As I answered yesterday in response to Judge Egorov's question, the command and control varied from place to place and from time to time.  It appears that the integration of Interahamwe into the civilian self-defence system happened earliest and most thoroughly in Kigali, which is, of course, not surprising because Kigali was the place where the Interahamwe were the largest in number and the best organised.  

Certainly it appears, I would say, within the first few days and certainly within the first week of the beginning of the violence that the Interahamwe are incorporated into this system.  It is, however, a progressive incorporation because, as I believe you wish to suggest, the system was not perfectly organised on the 6th of April, and it required a progressive building of connections through a system of orders, sanctions, and rewards in order to integrate the Interahamwe thoroughly.  

Later points of note would be at the end of April when the préfet calls the Interahamwe to the préfecture and sits down and discusses with them the terms and modalities of their incorporation and then the -- the progressive implementation of that in the weeks that follow. 
Q.	Madam Witness, do you know whether Mr. Renzaho sent other lists to the chief of staff since this is what he states in his letter dated 31st of March 1994? 
A.	(Microphones overlapping) 
Q.	Madam Witness, just one question, which might be deemed simplistic, and I wish to apologise for that, but do you believe -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What -- what was the answer in English, please?  
THE WITNESS:
I was asked if I knew whether Prefect Renzaho had sent other lists, and my answer was I do not know.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Yes, Madam Witness.  My question, my simplistic question, is as follows:  Do you believe that such an organisation was necessary for the purpose of killing people when presenting their identity cards or killing people simply because of the way they looked? 
A.	Rwandans are, in my experience, a highly organised and -- a highly organised people with a great capacity and taste for organisational complexity.  It doesn't surprise me that they chose to create an organisation that in the end is almost baroque in its levels of intricacy and sophistication, if you look at the May 25th documents.  

Are you suggesting that it wasn't necessary to have any organisation and that one needed simply to say to the population, by radio or otherwise, "Go kill Tutsi"?  Surely that would have been a little too gauche and probably ineffective.  It would have had significant disadvantages on the international scene, and it would have resulted in even more killing of people for personal reasons and for reasons of greed and common criminality than actually did happen.  

And I'm sure that it was in the intention of those mounting this system to ensure that it worked effectively and with the least amount of damage possible to those not included in its target.  Even the protests of the préfet, for example, on the question of the people at the barricades fleecing the merchants who try to go through, is an indication of the kinds of problems that result when authorities provide arms and the authority to use those arms to citizens who will then have no responsibility for what they do. 
Q.	Yes, but, Madam Witness, if we are to follow you, double talk was not enough to convince the citizens of what they were to do.  
A.	If I could point you, Counsel, to the portion of the transcript we examined yesterday -- where deputy -- the deputy, Rwajekare, insists that this has the force of law, this system, I think that's an -- a useful indicator of the importance of being able to cover this activity with the legitimacy of an official, and premature, if you will.  

Unless you subscribe to the doctrine that Hutu are either necessarily blood thirsty or necessarily the born enemies of Tutsi, doctrines which I find abhorrent, then you are obliged to look at an organisational structure which motivates, pressures, and obliges people to act in ways that they know to be immoral and illegal.  This kind of pressure can best be brought to bear on ordinary citizens by their own government because it is the government that is supposedly the legitimate authority, particularly in assuring questions of order.  And it was by putting the directives into the mouths of the authorities, known and recognised by ordinary citizens, that this system was able to achieve the massive killing of Tutsi civilians.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And, as we remember, the word referred to was R-W-A-J-E-K-A-R-E. 

BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Madam Witness, we are here before a Tribunal which is judging men.  And, as you stated previously, the Accused would have to be judged on a case-by-case basis.  The utterances of this gentleman, Rwajekare, are not utterances of Mr. Renzaho.  

Madam Witness, one question:  And still, in order to answer the question put to you by Judge Egorov yesterday, Mr. Renzaho conveyed to the chief of staff one first list of individuals, reservists, and others, who might participate in the civilian defence system.  Were you able to establish that some of these people were Interahamwe who were known, or militiamen? 
A.	I -- I have not attempted to identify the members of this list.  

And I would comment also, in response to your initial remark, that, of course, you are correct in drawing our attention to the fact that the statement I spoke of was not made by the prefect himself.  But we have seen many other cases where the préfet says, "We entrusted people with this authority," where he gives the orders to set up the barricades and to search for people who are hidden, so that it is not just to one quote in isolation that we are referring here.  We are describing a pattern of behaviour by officials, and notably by an official in charge of the city of Kigali, that conforms to and substantiates the assertion by this member of parliament that this system has the force of law.  
Q.	Madam Witness, you testified yesterday that, regarding Kigali town, the large-scale killings had not taken place, and you attributed it to the need to present a good image of the capital city.  

Don't you believe that there might have been other reasons for such a situation? 
A.	I certainly would not eliminate the possibility that there were other reasons involved.  For example, storming a stadium or a hotel requires perhaps a larger number of men and firepower than were at the disposition of the authorities at that time, or perhaps was regarded as an unnecessary use of such resources, given that the same thing could be accomplished in other ways.  I would not exclude that.  But when I look at the reaction, for example, of authorities to the incidents involving the Hôtel mille collines, where it is clear that potential attacks are averted as a result of international attention, that would suggest that this is, indeed, an important consideration in these decisions.  
(Pages 18 to 33 by Ann Burum)








1230H
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	So, on the same subject, Madam Witness, were the citizens of the world unaware of what was happening in Kigali as of the 7th of April 1994, even if no one did anything about it? 
A.	Indeed, you are right, Maître, but it is easier to ignore small-scale killings than massacres of thousands.  It becomes embarrassing after a while to keep turning your eyes away from massive slaughter.  I'm sure that that played a role in decisions both in Kigali and in Washington, London, Paris, Brussels, and other places.
Q.	Madam Witness, on the civilian defence, self-defence system, I'm going to make a modest suggestion to you.  Don't you think that its purpose was to play a role of an auxiliary to the army and, secondly, to fight the infiltrators and, further, to stop the killings and the looting? 
A.	In terms of its stated objectives, I would agree that those first two were among the stated objectives.  And to a certain extent, there is an argument even for the third.  But the important point to keep in mind here is that those killings and pillage would never have taken place had there not been the initial call for  "combatting the enemy."  So, yes, I think we could make an argument that the system over time is indeed attempting to tighten control, to sharpen focus, to ensure that the wrong people are not killed, which is to say, Hutu of regions other than the north, Hutu of parties other than the MRND and the CDR.  Yes, I think that certainly was the case.  And from the writings of 
former Prime Minister Kambanda, he is quite specific in saying people from the MDR are coming and complaining about this because Hutu are being killed.  Yes, they had to get that under control, for sure.  But that's not really the point here, is it?  The point is, why was the killing taking place to begin with?
Q.	Madam Witness, for you, as far as you are concerned, what are the conditions of an objective recording of history? 
A.	Maître, I think this is difficult ground in that, with the current scholarship, the state of current scholarship, and the whole business of post-modernist discourse, which may or may not be familiar to a lawyer, there are those who question whether the concept of objective history exists, as, indeed, there are questions as to whether or not even such ordinary scientific activities as physics can be objective in the sense of not being influenced by the observer.  So here we are really entering into virtually a metaphysical discussion which is not immediately relevant, perhaps.  

If you are asking me should a historian attempt to do honest work, drawing on as many sources as possible, obviously the answer is yes.
Q.	Yes, Madam Witness, but that is if you have to do with poor legal minds who are always concerned about getting clear and simple answers.  But, to continue, do you think that, to date, the conditions are met to write the history of the Rwandan tragedy? 
A.	History is a moving target, and we all must begin somewhere, with a modest recognition that whatever work we do may be changed, improved, corrected by others over time.  But there is no point in waiting for years to pass, if that's what you suggest, because sources of information are lost.  I, rather, believe it is important to begin as soon as possible, always keeping in mind that any source of information carries its risks as well as its advantages.
Q.	Do you think that the history that has been recorded to date to which -- in which you are one of the main actors may be reviewed?  Does this history contain risks or possibilities of being rewritten?  
A.	Not only is there a chance of that happening, it is happening.  It is happening sometimes in a positive sense, sometimes in a negative sense.  It depends on the quality and the intention of the author of the revision and the quality of the sources being used.  I have young colleagues who are now producing doctoral dissertations which are going to add to our knowledge of the field.  I am also aware of political extremists who are rewriting history.  So there are many ways to rewrite history.  Some are more legitimate than others.
Q.	Madam Witness, do you believe that justice may be exercised in a historical context which is not yet fine-tuned? 
A.	From my observations as a novice in the field of justice, I would say that the execution of justice always carries risks, perhaps particularly in situations involving the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and competing versions of the truth from multiple actors.  It is obviously a risky undertaking but one that must be done.  We cannot wait a generation until the actors are dead before we begin to consider who was responsible.  It must be done now.
Q.	You will observe, Madam Witness, that I'm not stating an opinion; I'm only asking questions. 

Now, for the historian, Madam Witness, who, by assumption, is a scientist, is there no danger of seeking to rationalise decisions or conducts, whereas human beings are affected -- human beings, by nature, are imperfect? 
A.	Historians may draw the wrong conclusions, subject to their own misinterpretation of information.  But, again, we must accept our own limitations as human beings, but that cannot be the paralysis.  We must act as morally and seriously as we can in the circumstances.  That is not to claim that any of us will ever render a perfect judgement.
Q.	Regarding what happened in Rwanda, there is the assumption of planning, which you have always supported, the assumption of a chaotic situation borne out -- spontaneously borne out of a situation leading to anarchy.  Can that be excluded? 
A.	On the 9th of April, before the interim government was sworn in, there was a massacre at Gikondo church in Kigali.  According to the written account by unarmed UN observers, passed through General Dallaire, the observers who were of Polish nationality were lodged with Polish priests at that church.  The army soldiers surrounded that neighbourhood, and the population, Hutu as well as Tutsi, took refuge in the church, gendarmes entered the church, and, on the basis of identity cards, selected the people who were to stay, who were Tutsi, and then after the Hutu had left, called in the militia.  As the slaughter progressed, the unarmed observers attempted to look away, and the gendarmes used their rifle butts to force their chins up so that they would be obliged to observe the carnage which they could not stop.  When the report was made to General Dallaire, he found, as did the persons observing the incident, a convincing example of cooperation between army, gendarmerie, militia, and civilian administrators.  This was on the 9th of April.  This is not a situation of chaos; this is not anarchy.  This is highly organised slaughter, genocidal slaughter, because the victims are chosen by virtue of their ethnicity.
Q.	Yes, Madam Witness, but in this specific example that you are giving, did you obtain any evidence that this was an order from the government or the chief of the army or the gendarmerie, since you yourself said that there were several cases where civilian authorities, military authorities, disobeyed orders and went ahead to commit killings? 
A.	I have no proof of orders, although I think the development of the event itself should suffice as proof of organisation.  As to the source of the orders leading to the implementing of the organisation, as I said, I have no proof.  However, the event was well known, and there were, to the best of my knowledge, no arrests, no sanctions, not even any scolding, no reproach over the radio or otherwise to those who had participated.  Were the authorities not responsible for giving the orders, they were surely responsible for holding the killers to account, and this they did not do.  Having done nothing, at the very least, having done nothing to sanction this massive, visible slaughter on the 9th of April, they had, at the very least, opened the door, if not provided the model and the incentive, for further killings.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is a moving example to everyone, and it makes the point that it is difficult to see how the chain of events over the 100 days' period can be explained as anarchy or chaos.  But does that answer respond to the first limb of the question, namely, the planning selection?  Based on ID cards is a very simple method, deeply rooted in the Rwandan society?  And cooperation between military, gendarmes, and civilians, leaving aside a possible civil defence initiative having been worked out for some time, that too could in a reasonably organised society be arranged in three days following inflammatory statements that the Tutsi shot down the president. 

Can you elaborate on that first limb, please? 
THE WITNESS:
It is true that the incident, were it isolated and the only such incident, could be interpreted as the private, quote, unquote, initiative of a group of angry army officers who meet with angry colleagues from the gendarmerie, and perhaps with Interahamwe leaders as well.  But the major part of the killing is done by Interahamwe and other members of the local population who are armed and ready to go. 

Now, it would not be impossible, I suppose, to organise the distribution of weapons in that three-day period as well.  I cannot exclude the possibility, but given that this is not the only such incident, it appears to me the likelihood that this was a single, isolated incident, quite different and apart from what else is happening in the country and in the city, is considerably reduced.  In other words, I spoke of a single incident because, to me, it symbolises some very important points, but it is one of many points of factual information which support the existence of planning and organisation.
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Yes, Madam Witness, regarding this terrible event that you have recounted, a factual clarification.  I want to believe that the situation in that neighbourhood does not exclude that there was fighting between the troops of the RPF and the Rwandan armed forces around the same period, between the 7th and the 9th of April.
A.	I do not know that for a fact.  I know that there was fighting in Gikondo after that date.  Whether there was, in fact, before that date, I could not say, and whether it represented actual military fighting as opposed to other use of firearms, I do not know.  And, as you say, even if it were the case, it is no excuse for gathering together a civilian population and slaughtering them.
Q.	Madam Witness, a rather more personal question, which is not intended to be unpleasant towards you.  But do you think that your closeness to that country, Rwanda, to persons who lived there who were killed during that event is not such as will negatively impact on your objectivity? 
A.	It would be unreasonable to expect that my views were not influenced by my contacts with Rwandans.  In fact, had they not been influenced by my contacts with Rwandans, one could conclude that my work was stupid and in vain, because what is the point of trying to understand a society unless one is open to its influences?  However, my contacts were not with one side of this conflict.  My contacts were with people who killed and who have been condemned for killing, as well as with victims.  Has this diminished my objectivity?  Perhaps so, but I have attempted to establish a factual basis for my conclusions, and it is for others to evaluate the accuracy of those facts and the extent of the logic displayed in the conclusions drawn from them.
Q.	Madam Witness, when one is faced with such a dramatic situation, is one not tempted to explain and does that also not involve a risk for the historian that you are? 
A.	It is the objective of most historians, as I know their work, to understand and analyse events.  Contemporary history goes beyond the recitation of facts and the amusing narrative to attempt to understand the more basic forces which drive events.  Whether this activity results in the end in any greater understanding, I suppose, depends not just on the author of the history but on those who read it.  There may in the end be certain events that are simply not comprehensible.
Q.	Madam Witness, don't you think that this polarization of historians that we are witnessing partly on account of the establishment of the ICTR -- and I'm not criticising the Tribunal -- don't you think that this could negatively impact on history and on justice?  
A.	One could say the polarization of history, the growing extremism and interpretations of these particular events, as other events, is not conducive to accurate, well-established history.  Yes, of course, one could say that.  But, deploring the growth of extremism does not remove it from existence, and it is simply the obligation, I believe, of historians who are serious about their work to attempt to find the solid ground in the middle of many conflicting and sometimes illegitimate claims.
Q.	And how do you explain, Madam Witness, your solitude today as an expert -- as a 
Prosecution expert witness? 
A.	I'm sorry, Maître.  Do you mean -- in what sense?  

	There are certainly other expert witnesses presented, both by the accusation and by the Defence.  Although sometimes I'm not in agreement with them, I don't know that I feel terribly in solitude. 
Q.	Madam Witness, I believe I have observed that for now, you are the only historian listed by the Prosecution.  What explanation do you give to this situation?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that a question to the witness or to the Prosecution team, which decided to call its witnesses?
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I observed that as of now, Prosecution has reverted to this expert witness, 
Madam Alison Des Forges, and I wanted to know if she is the only one in the situation.
THE WITNESS:
(Microphones overlapping)... are you referring to this particular trial or to a number of trials?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you begin again, please?  
THE WITNESS:
My question was whether counsel was referring to this particular trial or to a number of trials.
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	No, Madam Witness.  I'm making reference to a number of trials.  And to be more specific, or more explicit, other witnesses have been called by the Prosecution.  I have in mind Mr. Reyntjens, Mr. Guichauoua, who today have publicly indicated that they will no longer answer the call of the Prosecution, so it would appear to me that today you are the only one to come here as a Prosecution witness.  And what does this situation -- what impression does this situation give you, the situation that I may refer to as solitude or isolation?  
MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, once again, I simply want to raise the objection, which is really the point that Your Honour made, which, namely, it's the Prosecutor who decides who they are going to call and decide on which experts we do or do not use.  It is not a matter for this witness to comment on. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But let us cut this short and simply ask you the following question:  Do you consider yourself lonely, in the historic environment, amongst the experts on Rwanda?  That is the key question, I think.  And what is your answer?  
THE WITNESS:
Your Honours, as has been suggested by counsel's questions, there is a polarisation in the field of scholarship regarding Rwanda.  I cannot say that I feel myself in great sympathy or solidarity with historians of -- historians of another conviction, but I would say that there are a number of us who share a similar conviction about the facts, and, among those, I do not feel in solitude, and even among the others, I often have a basis for discussion.  

I believe counsel was interested in trying to elicit the -- and, in fact, said that Reyntjens and Guichauoua had refused to come and, basically, I was what was left.  That may be accurate for Reyntjens, but I don't believe for Guichauoua, because he is certainly still scheduled to appear in a number of trials.  And, of course, there are other persons appearing as expert witnesses, like Binaifer Nowrojee or various others.  That is spelled N-O-W-R-O-J-E-E; first name B-I-N-A-I-F-E-R.  

But in any case, it's -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is 1 o'clock.  Where are we?  
MR. CANTIER:
We are not far from the end, Mr. President, so I can confirm right now that I will be done by 13 -- 15 -- 1315 (sic) hours if we have a break.  I think I will need about half an hour maximum. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So what we heard you say now was that you would probably finish by 3:30 if we have a break, as usual, to 2:30, and that's what is going to happen.  
MR. CANTIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Court is adjourned.  

And, meanwhile, if you could look at those figures in the book, please, that would be helpful.  Thank you.  
(Court recessed from 1300H to 1430H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Good afternoon, madam.  Your research work, did it enable you to identify crimes committed by the RPF, which crimes would fall under the jurisdiction of this Tribunal? 
A.	Yes, Maître.  If you have read all of the chapters of (French spoken), the French version of Leave None to Tell the Story, you will have seen a chapter in there which details crimes committed by RPF soldiers and falling within the mandate of this Tribunal.  We have done other publications, as well, but this perhaps represents the easiest reference point.
Q.	Madam Witness, are you still working on the history of Rwanda? 
A.	I do.
Q.	Can you tell this Court whether you think the political regime in Rwanda, that is, the present regime, is a democratic regime? 
MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, I'm wondering what the relevance of the current situation in 2007 has to do with the report, which is on the history and the events of 1994. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any comment on that, Maître?  
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  The questions I'm going to ask next would enable the Court to understand.  This relates to the credibility of the witness, and under Rule 90(G), this is relevant to the theory of my case. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Credibility.  All right.  
THE WITNESS:
	I have two primary occupations:  One is historian; the other is a defender of human rights.  In the capacity of historian, I would not comment, in all likelihood, on whether this is or is not a democratic government, simply because that's not the kind of question that I would find relevant to my work.  In the domain of human rights, we also, as a general practice, avoid such terms as "democratic" or "not democratic" simply because they are so often the cause of rhetorical proclamations that have little meaning.  Instead, we prefer to confine ourselves to concrete demonstrations of violations of human rights and attempts to correct them.  In that regard, we have documented a number of human rights abuses carried out by officials of the current Rwandan government.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	In the January human rights report, that is the January 2007 report --
MR. CANTIER:
Which I would like to tender into evidence, Your Honours.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	-- you mention this organisation to which you belong and you also mention the justice situation in Rwanda, particularly through the analysis of trials going on before Gacaca courts.  Can you tell us what you were able to observe?
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have in front of us in the file you have distributed many reports from 2007.  Which one are you now referring to?  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I am now referring to the human rights report of January 2007, the report of 
January 2007. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are referring to the Human Rights Watch report.  Isn't that so?  
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, that is correct, Mr. President.  It is entitled, in French, "Murder in the East of Rwanda." 

Registry, could you please give a copy of that report to the witness, a copy of the report that we gave you?  We prepared a French copy, as well as an English copy, of the report. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, and the witness, I am referring, in particular, to page 14 in the French version, paragraph 2 thereof, and in the English version, this would be page 13, paragraph 1. 

In French, it begins with (French spoken) and so on.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the interpreters do not seem to have the document referred to. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could it be the sentence starting, "The assumption that genocidal ideas underlie"?  Is that the one?  
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, that is correct, Mr. President.  

And my second reference -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let us now find out whether the interpreters have this document, "Human Rights Watch," and then we will see how much will come out of this exercise.  Do you have it?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
No, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Always one set for the booth.  

Has the booth received one copy -- oh, you did?  

Anyhow, let's continue.  But, please, Registry, get in touch and see whether a resolution can be found.  Please, Mr. Matemanga, can you get in touch with the booth, please, and find out what is the problem?  

Let us start.  
MR. CANTIER:
My second reference, Mr. President, Madam Witness, is on page 16 of this same report, page 16 of the French version, the last paragraph.  In the English version, this would be on page 14, the last paragraph, which in French begins with (French spoken). 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And what -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
In English, it begins with "Given the fears."  That is the last paragraph.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	The question, Madam Witness, is to know whether the situation in Rwanda today would enable Gacaca courts to render fair justice.  
MR. MOSES:
Your --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is this really something that can arguably influence the Court's assessment of this witness's credibility?  Do you really think it will achieve anything here, Maître?  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, this is useful -- this is relevant to my case.  It is also relevant to the charges brought against Mr. Renzaho. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it linked to the testimony of some of the Prosecution witnesses, for instance?  
MR. CANTIER:
It is a question relating to the charges and the testimonies that have been adduced before Gacaca courts, and we also know that several witnesses who have come here have also testified before Gacaca courts. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the answer, please?  
THE WITNESS:
This report is not an evaluation of Gacaca.  We are far from being able to do that, and when we do, it will be considerably more than 15 pages long.  The references indicated by counsel have to do with explanations given for killings recently in Rwanda, rather than the Gacaca process itself.  If I were to answer the question about is justice possible under Gacaca, the answer, of course, would have to be it is possible.  If the question were does it happen, then the answer would have to be sometimes, but not always, which is true in most judicial systems.  Perhaps we will, in the end, conclude that it happens less frequently in Gacaca than in many judicial systems, but we are not yet at a point to be able to say that.  We have documented a number of abuses; we have also sometimes documented cases where it worked surprisingly well.  It depends on the community, it depends on the local power structure, and it is a very complicated situation to assess in a short summary.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Are you aware of the assessment or -- of the Gacaca trials that was carried out by the association called Lawyers Without Borders?  In French it is (French spoken).  
A.	(Microphones overlapping)... I don't know to which one you are referring, but I have read many of 
them.  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, this is the second document I would like to tender into evidence.  It is entitled, "Monitoring of Gacaca Courts, the Judgement Process, Analytical Report No. 2," dated October 2005 to September 2006.  I regret I was not able to obtain a copy of the document in English, but the witness understands French, so I believe there will be no problem. 

Registry staff, please, could you hand this document over to the witness, please, the second document dated October 2005, September 2006?  

To be brief, I would like to mention an assessment of the association, and that assessment, Mr. President, Madam Witness, Your Honours, is found on page 43 of this report.  It is on that chapter A -- rather, it is the second paragraph.  There are three paragraphs in that part of the report.  It is entitled, "Giving priority to effective participation of the population by clearing impediments to freedom of speech."  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have all found it, so what do we do now?  Should we read something?  
MR. CANTIER:
If you allow me, Mr. President, I will read the third sentence of that passage.  

"It is, therefore, important that measures be taken to clear all that seems to be obstacles to freedom of speech.  This is all the more important as the collection of testimonies during the investigation phase by the Gacaca courts in cellules overlooked, in violation of the law, the exculpatory testimonies."
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Madam Witness, what do you gather from this passage? 
A.	This observation conforms to observations done by Human Rights Watch and others, in that in the initial stages of information gathering, persons accused were not provided an opportunity to answer the accusations against them but were told that their opportunity to respond needed to await the formal trial phase itself.  What we have here is a recommendation by an international, non-governmental organisation that has been conducting monitoring of Gacaca, a recommendation that in the trial phase that the accused be, in fact, afforded the opportunity to call witnesses to prove that they are not guilty. 
Q.	The third document -- and after presenting the document in question will follow -- the third document is an Amnesty International report.  It is dated November 2002.  
MR. CANTIER:
Registry staff, could you please give that document to the witness?  
THE WITNESS:
I think this is not it.  This is not the document. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.  The Defence counsel said:
MR. CANTIER:
The document was dated in 2002.  The English version, 2006, paragraphs 3 and 4.  The English version will be shown to you, Madam Registry Staff.  This is the English version.  It is being held up by co-counsel.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, I wanted to read to you two paragraphs that I have taken from this long document.  The -- or, it, rather, deals with justice in Rwanda.  I will read the paragraphs taken from the document. 

"The government" --
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are now -- 
MR. CANTIER:
Page 36, Mr. President.  Page 36 of the English version, paragraph 3.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, perhaps -- it begins about four lines from the top of that paragraph. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We start with the French version now.  Are you in the Amnesty International document dated November 2002 and which is entitled, in French, "Gacaca" (French spoken)?  Is that the document?  
MR. CANTIER:
That is entirely correct, Mr. President.  And on the French version, it is page 33.  And the second paragraph -- I will be reading from the second and third paragraphs. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We don't find the English here, but we have the French.  Please go ahead.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	"The government is extremely intolerant of dissenters or those dissatisfied with its performance to readily accusing such individuals of genocide or treason.  Critics of the government, including members of the national assembly, prominent members of civil society and independent journalists, have been intimidated, detained and ill treated or forced into exile; some have disappeared or been killed."  I will skip one sentence and go on to the next sentence.  "Some Rwandese fear that they would be arrested if they provide evidence in support of the defendants' innocence or if they demonstrate too much knowledge or information about the genocide." 

Now, I will move on to the sentence which I have selected in the fourth paragraph.  In the English version -- in the English version, this is still on page 36.  "Amnesty International has received several reports of individuals who were persecuted by the Rwandese government by refusing to testify against genocide suspects, either because they had not witnessed the crimes committed or because they felt the accusation was untrue.  Some of these individuals were told that, as Tutsi, they knew they were targeted for genocide.  Refusing to give false testimony was effectively regarded as treason.  One wonders how many individuals succumbed to government pressure."  

Now, my question is as follows:  Do you think that witnesses living in Rwanda enjoy freedom of speech or can speak freely? 
A.	We have documented cases where witnesses have been afraid to speak.  In some cases, those witnesses are survivors who have hesitated to speak in defence of accused persons, including those that have protected them.  In some cases those witnesses are survivors who have not accused people of whom they know, of whom they have good reason to know those persons are guilty.  They have not spoken because they are afraid of reprisals, either from the accused person or from others among his family or friends.  We also have documented cases of persons who have refused to speak from fear, either for or against an accused person, who are not survivors.  

	So I think it is clear that there are situations where witnesses are reluctant to speak, perhaps one could even say increasingly reluctant to speak, and the killings of persons involved in Gacaca, including witnesses and judges, documented in the report we looked at briefly by Human Rights Watch no doubt make it even more difficult for witnesses to agree to speak.  Nonetheless, there are many who are courageous enough to speak, even in the face of either popular disapproval, threats from individuals or, in certain cases, threats from officials.  It is, I would stress, an extremely variable situation, depending upon local conditions.
Q.	Madam Witness, you had the experience of the trial against Father Theunis, spelt 
T-H-U-E-U-N-I-S (sic) -- T-H-E-U-N-I-S.  Was that not an example of false accusations levelled against an individual? 
A.	The testimony which I heard presented, and I believe that was the only testimony presented, was certainly unconvincing and in some cases obviously distorted the facts.  Whether in some cases the testimony was also outright lies, I cannot affirm for sure.  I can say, having been a witness in that proceeding, that I was myself, if not threatened, at least disagreeably warned after having spoken in his defence.
Q.	I knew that you had had such an experience and that you had shown great courage, Madam Witness. 

Do you recall the name of the main accuser of Father Theunis? 
A.	I am not sure whom one would identify as the principal accuser.  As I understand it, the case was developed by the prosecutor's office, although it was then presented to the Gacaca rather than to a conventional -- if you wish to use that word -- to a conventional court.  Certain names have been mentioned to me as persons who participated in the elaboration of that file.  And, of course, I am familiar with the names of some of the persons who spoke publicly, but I do not know which one one would choose to identify as the principal accuser.
Q.	Among the prosecution witnesses, was there not a person who is a commissioner for human rights in Rwanda? 
A.	I believe that one of the witnesses was a person who was at one time a member of the 
Human Rights Commission.  Whether he was still a member -- I believe he was still a member, yes.
Q.	Madam Witness, before I conclude, I wish to know whether this situation does not confirm what 
Orwell -- the sentence, "Whereby those who control the present control the past."  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Orwell, O-R-W-E-L-S (sic), says counsel, the author of the best seller "1984."
THE WITNESS:
It is a question of time perspective, is it not?  Those who control the present may control the past for the present, but at some point those in control are no longer the present and at that point the past may be corrected.  Perhaps that is the duty of the historian. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Shall we agree on the spelling of George Orwell?  
THE WITNESS:
I believe that Orwell is spelled O-R-W-E-L-L.  
MR. CANTIER:
This marks the end, Mr. President, Your Honours, of my cross-examination.  

Thank you, Madam Witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We will come back to three additional documents concerning Prosecution exhibits and then the documentation used during the Defence cross-examination in a moment.  

Now, the question is, is there any re-examination?  
MR. MOSES:
Four brief matters, Your Honour.
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, you were asked in cross-examination regarding the -- those who might be in charge of communal police, and I think you gave an answer which indicated that bourgmestres were in charge of communal police.  Is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Were you aware, Dr. Des Forges, of the -- what has been described by some witnesses here as the unique situation in Kigali-ville regarding the structure of the -- that particular commune whereby the police were, in effect, under the direct authority of the préfet? 
A.	I was not aware of that.
Q.	Okay.  Now, the second issue I think you were going to try and find -- locate in your book, and I don't know if you were able to, the numbers of either gendarmes that were in Kigali city, and perhaps if you could refer us to that.
A.	At page 194 of Leave None to Tell the Story -- and, I'm sorry, I don't have the French corresponding page -- but if you look at footnote numbers, it would be the page that has footnote numbers 47, 48 and 49.  I have written that the gendarmerie units present in Kigali and the immediate vicinity would have been 1,000.  That was an estimate based upon conversations with several officers of the gendarmerie, as well as upon testimony in a Belgian judicial file.  Although, in fact, I think the reference to the Belgian judicial file has to do with the information in that sentence about the heavy weaponry of combat soldiers and battle experience lacking for gendarmes.  So, in short, the number I estimated was in the vicinity of 1,000.
Q.	Thank you.  You were also asked a question regarding the chain of command, if I can put it that way, in terms of how contact might be made and who it might be made with within the communal structure.  And you referred to the fact that there was some comment during one of the radio broadcasts regarding that issue and that you had made reference to it.  I don't believe, in fact, that we did look at that particular issue, and I'm wondering if you can please look in volume 2.  It's Prosecution Exhibit 54; it's under tab 8, and in the English it's on page 16, the second paragraph, which has K0272364; and in the French, it's on page 23 in the third paragraph.  

And if I can just read that paragraph and ask you to comment on it, Dr. Des Forges.  It says -- and this is the meeting -- sorry -- this is the broadcast which you had yesterday described as being what appeared to be a broadcast of a meeting with conseillers.  And the Accused says:  "During the meeting that may perhaps be held this evening, I will come back to this issue to ask that one more telephone line be made available to the public, which will then make it unnecessary for them to call me directly.  When I am called, I immediately inform headquarters, which then contacts the person concerned."  

Is that the passage that you were thinking of when you gave your answer, Dr. Des Forges? 
A.	Yes, I was thinking -- yes, I was thinking of the -- of this meeting with the conseiller.  And as I look at it, I see also the -- probably the responsable of the cellule and the invitation by the prefect to use an additional telephone line rather than apparently bothering him with certain calls.
Q.	Thank you.  

Now, the last point I wanted to cover in re-examination has to do with the organisation of the civil defence.  And in your answers to one or two of the questions, you had referred to the directives of the prime minister, Kambanda, that were issued on the 25th of May, and which I think -- I believe you indicated in one of your answers was a good indication of the joint governance of the civil defence system between the civilian authorities and the military.  

Is that a fair summation of what you had said? 
A.	Yes, except that I was referring to both the directive of the prime minister and the directive of the minister of interior.
Q.	In particular -- looking, if we can, at the directive of the prime minister, I'm wondering whether you could, please, look at volume 1 of your -- of the bundle of documents.  It's Prosecution Exhibit 37, which is in -- under tab 2-A, 2 capital A.  Now, that is, for everyone, after number 31.  It goes 31, then 1-A, and then 2-1.  

I'm wondering if you could look at that document, please.  Is that the directive that you have referred to in your answer? 
A.	It is.
Q.	And are there any particular points in that document that you would be able to draw the Trial Chamber's attention to which would support your conclusions that the system was being run jointly by the communal authorities and the military? 
A.	On page 2 of the French -- I don't believe I have the English -- is there an English version in here?
Q.	No, there's not.  
A.	Okay.  Page 2 of the French, which is marked K0242387, the third paragraph speaks of a close collaboration between the territorial administration, political parties defending the principle of the republic, and the democracy.  That was, if you recall, one of the points that I made concerning the interface between the administrative structure and the political party structure.  And then at the -- there may be others, but simply to save the Court's time, one further example on -- at paragraph 8.9, which is on page 4 of the document, an indication that the coordination committee at the national level includes -- includes the following people:  The minister of interior and communal development, who is the president of the group, or the chair; the minister of defence, who is the vice president or vice-chair; and then an officer of the Rwandan armed forces chief of staff -- or, the chief of staff, rather -- I misread that -- the chief of staff of the Rwandan armed forces, who is a member of the committee; a coordinator, who is a high-ranking officer; an assistant coordinator, who is an experienced civil servant; and then it goes on, jurist, a major, and so on and so forth.  

So the committee, in its very composition, is an indication, as well as the positions of chair and vice-chair, being allocated to the minister of interior and the minister of defence, with the minister of interior given priority.
Q.	Thank you.  And just one -- on that same document, if -- looking at 8.7, on page 4, and, in particular, the second and maybe third points there, does that give you any indication as to whether or not this system is to be run by the military or any other body? 
A.	Yes.  In fact, paragraph 8.7 establishes a préfectoral committee for coordination.  And the next paragraph establishes that the prefect of préfecture is, by his office, necessarily a member and plays the role of supervisor -- or, one could call -- could say chief executor of the civilian self-defence activities within the préfectoral circumscription or territory.  He also is in charge of the meetings.
MR. MOSES:
Thank you very much, Dr. Des Forges.  Those are the only matters I wanted to raise in re-examination.  

Do Your Honours have any questions for the witness?  
JUDGE EGOROV:
Dr. Des Forges, I have a few questions on different matters; the first question about so-called infiltrators.  To your knowledge, how many people in Rwanda were arrested and tried on the ground that they were infiltrators and carried out relevant activities?   
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, before April the 6th, I'm aware of, perhaps, several dozen cases, at the most, of persons who were charged with that crime.  Whether they were rightly charged, I do not know, because I did not follow the judicial proceedings.  After the 6th of April, I do not know of anyone accused in a formal judicial sense of being an infiltrator, nor in most of my interviews in most of my gathering of information have I found cases where authorities could say and present substantial information confirming that infiltrators had actually been arrested or captured in their areas.
JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you.  

And as far as private property, before 1994, a great deal of Tutsi fled the country and left behind them houses, lots of land, cattle and so on.  What happened to that property?  As well as after the events of 1994, the same happened to Hutus.  So, is there any difference with -- if we compare the legal and the factual fate of their properties -- maybe, in general?  
THE WITNESS:
In the years before 1994, as well as during the period April through July, the property of Tutsi who were killed or who fled was treated in several different ways.  The major pieces of capital equipment, shall we say, automobiles, computers, whatever, were generally allocated to the most important of the assailants and/or to the local administrative authority.  The land, including residences, were allocated by the administrative authority generally to people in his circumscription, in his territory.  Crops and farm animals and smaller property, like pots and pans, would be divided among the assailants, either on the spot or soon after when the crop became ripe for harvest.  This was a cause of some administrative concern, because in some cases, and I believe also in Kigali city from the broadcasts we have read, groups of assailants left their own domain, so to speak, and went to other parts of the city or into other regions to carry out these killing and pillaging activities because it was profitable to do so, and occasionally you find administrators scolding these groups, saying, "You must stay at home and confine your -- confine your activities to your home turf."  

For the question of the property of Hutu who fled the country, I do not know of a formal, legal order in the early months, that is to say, from April or May, in those areas where the RPF had taken control or ultimately from July through September or October.  In practice, what happened was that, particularly the residences in the city and in some cases property in the countryside, especially the east, was occupied by either military or by Rwandans, most of them Tutsi, returning from outside. 

After September or October, I'm not sure of the exact date, 1994, the government publicised -- in the refugee camps -- publicised a policy guaranteeing that those people who had fled would have their property restored.  In fact, a substantial number of those who returned did have their property restored.  In some cases, it took a long time.  In some cases, it required judicial action.  I would not say that it has been 100 per cent effective, but, certainly, in many cases property was restored.  In other cases, because there was official pressure to vacate property for persons returning from exile, those then, in occupation, would make accusations against those returning and particularly accuse them of participation in genocide in order to be legitimated in their holding and in order to avoid having to relinquish or give back the property to those returnees.  That also happened.

1530H 
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Thank you.  And the last, I think, very simple question:  To your knowledge, who was the first, after the 6th of April 1994, to come up with an idea that what was going on in the country in Rwanda fell under the genocide convention?  States, governmental, or non-governmental organisation; who, and when?  If -- yeah.  
THE WITNESS: 
Human Rights Watch wrote to the Security Council, I believe it was the 19th of April, raising the question -- not affirming, but raising the question, "On the basis of the current evidence, this appears to be a genocide".  I believe the next affirmative statement was by Oxfam, on perhaps the 21st of April.  Privately, among diplomats and in diplomatic correspondence, the term was in use at that time, but was not publicly enunciated.  The Pope used it in early May -- I believe the 3rd of May.  
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Thank you very much.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You kindly came back to us and referred to page 194 of Leave none to tell the story concerning the number of gendarmes in Kigali.  Does it follow from the book how many police officers there were, communal police, in Kigali in the same period?  
THE WITNESS: 
I'm sorry, Your Honour, my research was not headed in that direction.  I was dealing with the national -- with the gendarmerie in another aspect, and I did not pursue the question in terms of communal police. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You mentioned a political agreement to distribute the préfectoral posts according to the parties.  If you look back to the period in 1994, how would you describe the party affiliation of the prefects during that period?  
THE WITNESS: 
Both at the level of the préfet, and at the level of ministerial appointments, there continued to be a conformity -- the arrangements continued to conform to the notion that the spoils should be divided in a certain proportion.  And, as far as I know, that was the same agreement as had been in effect since 1992.  In fact, what was happening, of course, was that the MRND was becoming so powerful that it pulled into its orbit other political figures, regardless of party affiliation.  So we were moving into the direction of a one-party arrangement, regardless of the fact that other parties maintained their nominal existence. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, what does this mean in practical terms?  There were how many préfectures?  Eleven?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And how were the seats distributed?  
THE WITNESS: 
Oh dear.  The one that was new, that is to say a party which had not previously shared spoils at préfectoral level, was the CRD, the coalition -- the CDR, the coalition for the defence of the republic, which received the préfecture of Byumba.  Kayishema continued to represent the Christian democratic party.  Gisenyi was allocated eventually to the liberal party -- that was after the préfet of Butare was changed.  Kibungo went to the -- hmm.  I'm sorry, I would have to sit down with pencil and paper and work it out.  The -- the major -- the -- the biggest force, the party which had the predominant number of préfectures would certainly have been the MRND.  The PSD was given Butare after the 19th -- after the 17th of April.  Gikongoro was MRND, Cyangugu was MRND, Gitarama was MDR.  Beyond that, I would have to do some research.  I'm sorry, I don't recall.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
When was the préfet of Butare changed?  
THE WITNESS: 
The announcement appeared on the radio on April the 16th, I believe -- 16th or 17th.  I think the government meeting was the 16th, and whether it was actually on the radio the 16th or the 17th, I do not recall.  But it was that weekend.  And then the actual installation was the 19th of April -- the installation of the new préfet.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That was the end of your testimony.  Thank you very much for having come the long way to testify before the Tribunal.  We wish you a very safe journey home.  Thank you very much.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  
(Witness excused) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Prosecution, you very kindly, last Friday, provided excerpts of three previous French Prosecution exhibits, namely, P. 61, P. 62, P. 63.  We have them now in our binders, but they should be formally entered as exhibits in the other language.  So, do we then agree that the English version of P. 61 will be, Mr. Matemanga, P. 61B, whereas the previous version was P. 61A; the English version of the 18th of June transcript becomes, then, P. 62B; and the English version of the second transcripts, dated 18th of June '94, becomes P. 63B.  
(Exhibit No. P. 61B admitted)
(Exhibit No. P. 62B admitted)
(Exhibit No. P. 63B admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
There are no other outstanding Prosecution exhibit issues, to my knowledge.  
MR. MOSES: 
There is the one.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Except for the one we will hand down -- 
MR. MOSES: 
Absolutely, absolutely. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
-- a decision on.
MR. MOSES:
That's the only other one.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, yes.  

Now, Defence counsel, please.  You started with resolution 872 from 1993, adopted by the Security Council.  Do you want to start with that as your first exhibit?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Matemanga?  

Mike, please.  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 35A and B.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
A for the French, B for the English.  
(Exhibit No. D. 35A and D. 35B admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Then you moved on to the document dated the 20th of December 1993, from UNAMIR?  
MR. CANTIER: 
That's correct, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. CANTIER: 
The KWSA defence agreement. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Said the Defence counsel.  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Matemanga?  D. 36?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
For this document.  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  
(Exhibit No. D. 36 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The next was Human Rights Watch report on killings in eastern Rwanda.  
MR. CANTIER: 
That's correct, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 37A and B.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
A for the French, B for the English.  
(Exhibit No. D. 37A and D. 37B admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Then the second report of Avocats sans frontières, October 25 to September 26. 
MR. CANTIER: 
That's correct, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 38.  
(Exhibit No. D. 38 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Then Amnesty International's report of November 2002.  

Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 39.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I understand that that document is also available in English; was that so, Defence counsel?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President.  We have it in both French and English.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could we make sure that the registry has both versions.  That seems to be the case.  A for the French, B for the English.  
(Exhibit No. D. 39A and D. 39B admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you want to tender anything concerning Father Theunis, T-H-E-U-N-I-S, or was this your last exhibit?  
MR. CANTIER: 
If my colleague of the Prosecution does not have any objection, I would like to do so. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It wasn't actually used.  
MR. MOSES: 
No, it wasn't.  Therefore I wouldn't be in agreement.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, you will have to wait for another opportunity, then, even if we have a nice picture of Father Theunis here now.  Maybe some other time.  
MR. CANTIER: 
I will find that opportunity, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Any other exhibits?  That doesn't seem to be the case.  
MR. CANTIER: 
No, Mr. President, for the time being that's all we have.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You will recall that the witness in the other country that we will be hearing through the video link asked that we start at 8:30 that country's time.  That means that we will start in 45 minutes with the video link, and that will give ample time for the technicians to install the video link.  

Anything of a practical nature we need to address before we take the break?  
MR. MOSES: 
No, Your Honour, other than it might, at the -- I don't know, at the conclusion of the video link testimony, whether that's a suitable time for Your Honours to address any other issues regarding the continuation of the trial, or whether -- I'm in Your Honours' hands regarding that.  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will see how much time the cross-examination requires, but one way would be maybe to have a brief session tomorrow after the finalisation of this video link, which will probably spill over after normal working hours in the Tribunal.  Would that be agreeable, Defence counsel?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Of course, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right, we will then adjourn to 4:30.  
(Court recessed from 1546H to 1630H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon.  

Good afternoon, Madam Witness.  Or, good morning, your time.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good afternoon.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will now start your -- 
THE WITNESS: 
(No interpretation) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
-- cross-examination.  

Defence?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
I'm obliged, Mr. President.  
WITNESS ACK (continued)
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Madam Witness, good afternoon.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.  
Q.	Madam Witness, before I start, may I, first and foremost, on behalf of Mr. Renzaho, express our most sincere condolences and our deep compassion for the personal drama you were affected with in this sad year of 1994.  
A.	I thank you.  
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  Madam Witness, I simply wish to deal with a number of details with you.  First of all, regarding CELA.  Yesterday you referred to a young man called Bitega.  

Can you hear me, Madam Witness?  
A.	Yes, I can hear you.  
Q.	I was saying that yesterday you referred to a young man called Bitega who allegedly advised you to go to the Sainte Famille parish.  Do you recall having made such a statement?  
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Tell me, Madam Witness, when he was advising you, was this done in the presence of Father Munyeshyaka?  
A.	Father Munyeshyaka was present. 
Q.	According to you, Madam Witness, why was it that this young man was not among those who were selected on that day?  
A.	In any event, this young man had also gone to Renzaho, but I do not know how it was that he was next to the gate.  And then after we were told to go back home, he whispered to us that we should not go back home, and Father Munyeshyaka told him, "If you are afraid, go to the church."  And it is why we went to the church. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  And you went to the church in the company of that young man, Madam Witness?  
A.	No. 
Q.	Very well, Madam Witness.  Madam Witness, to conclude on this matter of CELA, do you recall having testified in the trial of one Macumi, Alphonse, in Rwanda, regarding the disappearance of your kin?  As a civil party.  
A.	It is true that Macumi *********************************.  He was the one who kept all the weapons that were distributed to the Interahamwe, and he was a nyumbakumi, he was the head of ten households ******************************. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
I shall spell out the name Macumi:  M-A-C-U-M-A (sic). 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says Counsel.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
And the first name is Alphonse.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Madam Witness, do you thus confirm that you were a civil party in the trial against Macumi in Rwanda?  
A.	Yes, I testified against Macumi, and I'm also accusing him.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Witness, is the last vowel I or A?  Macumi, or Macuma?  Can you help us, madam?  
THE WITNESS: 
His name is Macumi. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Madam Witness, I have before me the judgment which was handed down following your testimony against Macumi, and with the Trial Chamber's leave, I would like the Kinyarwanda booth to read out an excerpt of this judgment -- at least two paragraphs of this judgment.  And then I shall request from you that you comment on the contents of this paragraph.  Did you understand me, Madam Witness?  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	Very well.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I have already provided the said documents to the Kinyarwanda booth, which is the first document in -- of the bundle of documents I provided to them, and the part to be read is underscored in blue on the first page of the document, and the last paragraph of the second page, which spills over on the third page.  If the Kinyarwanda booth could be authorised to read out the parts that have been thus underscored.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, please do that.  Thank you.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Counsel, do you wish us to read out the text in Kinyarwanda, or do you want us to translate it into French?  A question put by the Kinyarwanda booth.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Perhaps it would be better to read it out in Kinyarwanda for the witness, and then the translation should be made according to what we customarily do.  I don't know whether this is the best formula.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Shall we try that?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Mr. President, it's not possible to read it out in Kinyarwanda and have it translated into French at the same time.  Since this comes from the same booth, the Kinyarwanda booth, it cannot be done simultaneously.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  Why don't you rush directly into French, in view of the fact that the witness is fluent in French.  

Shall we start?  
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: 
Paragraph 11:  "Regarding Alphonse Macumi, also known as Kigomeke, while he was in Rugenge, Nyarugenge commune, Kigali-ville préfecture, in the Republic of Rwanda.  As a perpetrator, co-perpetrator, or accomplice as provided for under articles 89, 90, and 91 of the penal code, booklet 1, he killed Tutsis after having taken them out of the place of refuge, that is to say respectively the CELA centre, Sainte Famille, and the Saint Paul centre.  The victims are, amongst other people, Charles Rwanga and his children, Ngarambe, Charles Gahima, as well as many others.  It is a crime which is provided for by article 312 of the penal code, booklet 2."  

End of translation of paragraph 11.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do the court reporters have this excerpt?  French court reporters, you have not received this Kinyarwandan excerpt?  You will see the spellings there.  So we start with paragraph 11, and Kigomeke is K-I-G-O-M-E-K-E, and the other names are spelt with capitals.  

What is the next portion then, Defence counsel?  Still marked with blue, isn't it, the next page?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, indeed, Mr. President.  And may I specify that the court reporters also have been given folders where all the documents are contained.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Excellent, thank you.  

Dear booth, shall we take the next portion?  
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: 
"Since the floor is given to the public prosecution for it to expose the accusations against Macumi, as well as the evidence on these accusations, and that the following person has stated what follows:  Macumi was a nyumbakumi" -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
This is too fast, this is too fast.  Can I ask you to slow down a little bit.  Let's start again.  Yes.  
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: 
"The floor has been given to the public prosecution office in order for it to mention the accusations against Macumi, as well as the evidence against him, and that the public prosecutor stated what follows:  Macumi was a nyumbakumi.  He started carrying out criminal acts as early as 1990 when he had people arrested under the pretext that they were accomplices.  Subsequently he was a member of a crisis committee, along with Mukandituye, Nyirabagenzi, and Telesphore.  He would hold meetings in his residence during which leaders would be given instructions in order to kill people.  He had Charles Rwanga and his children killed, as well as Emile Rukundo, Bicinoni, after having taken them out of Sainte Famille.  There are a number of witnesses who have provided such evidence, and they are the following:  Rose Murorunkwere, Pierre Nkusi, Mathieu Muvunyi, Alphonse Gisagara, Béatha Mazimpaka, Pierre Gatete, Donatha Niragire, Sylvie Barakagwira, and Gisèle Mukamfura.  Aluwa, Joseph, states that Macumi burnt down Mukamazimpaka's house."  
End of the translation.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
My thanks go to the Kinyarwanda booth.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Madam Witness, after having heard these paragraphs, I wish for you to comment on the allegation of the prosecution, whereby the persons killed were abducted from the Sainte Famille parish without any reference being made to the CELA centre.  What can you state regarding this situation, Madam Witness?  
A.	Could you please repeat your question, Counsel?  And briefly so.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says the witness.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Yes, Madam Witness.  On the basis of the allegations made by the prosecutor, the people who were killed were allegedly abducted from the Sainte Famille parish, and a number of people are mentioned as being witnesses testifying to that effect.  My question to you is as follows:  Why is reference made to Sainte Famille rather than to CELA?  
A.	Most of the people who are mentioned, such as for example Gisagara, Mukamazimpaka, are people who testified on members of their family.  And I also told you about members of my family who were killed.  My impression is that this is a summary of the testimonies that has nothing to do with the statement -- or, the testimony I made.  Because there are other people who are being referred to in this paragraph.  Alphonse was nyumbakumi and he had weapons.  Yesterday I testified that my husband had stayed at home, and when he noted that the situation was serious, he joined us at CELA.  All the bushes had been cleared, which means that we could even see our houses.  

So the nyumbakumis were those who organised the community work, during which the vicinity of CELA was cleared, and the nyumbakumis were those who wrote the lists in the different neighbourhoods.  And they conveyed those lists to their superiors.  This is the answer I can provide on the matter.  But if you are referring to what has just been read out to me, it is a summary which deals with the cases of several different people.  That is what I can say.  
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  Madam Witness, let us now move on to your stay at CELA.  While you were -- Sainte Famille, rather.  My apologies.  While you were at Sainte Famille, do you remember a meeting allegedly held by General Dallaire with the refugees within the grounds of Sainte Famille in early May 1994?  
A.	I did not attend that meeting -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you know --

THE WITNESS: 
-- and I'm not aware that such a meeting took place. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Adds the witness.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Madam Witness, did you know the UNAMIR officer who was responsible for the organisation of evacuations from Sainte Famille and Saint Paul at the time?  
A.	I know that a given point in time, members of UNAMIR came to see us.  Some might have spoken to them and told them about our problems, but I would not move around.  I would stay sitting in the same place, because I was extremely sad.  But, apparently, they wrote a letter.  I heard that refugees who were at the Sainte Famille parish wrote a letter to UNAMIR. 
Q.	Merci -- 
A.	But I was not an eyewitness to this.  I simply heard about it.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, with other words, Madam Witness, you do not know the UNAMIR officer who was responsible for the organisation of evacuations from Sainte Famille and Saint Paul at the time?  Isn't that true?  Can you answer that with a yes or no, please.  You do not know, do you?  
THE WITNESS: 
Non.  But I would see that person come and go.  But I would not be able to recognise him. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  Madam Witness, during your stay in Sainte Famille, did the complex undergo any shelling, in your presence?  
A.	Yes, I was there. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  Madam Witness, this UNAMIR officer you would see stated that he had posted four of his observer officers, who would remain there all day, and would only go back to UNAMIR in the evening.  He also stated that following the shelling, a meeting was held with refugees.  Does that not correspond to what you experienced?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is this based on testimony or a document?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
This is a proposition I'm putting to the witness, Mr. President.  It is not a document I wish to have entered into evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But you have a prima facie basis for that proposition?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, I do, Mr. President, but I fear that I will not be given leave to have it admitted into evidence if the witness refuses to discuss it with me.  It is the second document, the minutes that I had distributed and which are in the folder.  And it is entitled "Minutes of witness testimony".  So if I'm not in a position to have this document admitted into evidence, I would at least wish to put its contents to the witness by way of suggestion. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The question was asked simply for everyone in the courtroom to understand what was going on, since we didn't know the basis.  You have now referred to your basis for the question, and the question is -- is there any objection?  
MR. MOSES: 
I can't locate -- 
MR. NEKUIE: 
It is the second document, Counsel for the Prosecution.  It's the part that is underscored in blue on the second page of the said document. 
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The question is allowed.  

Do you want it repeated, Madam Witness?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Very well, I'm going to repeat the question.  I was saying that the officer in question stated that at Sainte Famille, he had posted four UNAMIR observers who left Sainte Famille only in the evening, because they stayed there the whole day.  He also stated that, with General Dallaire, they held a meeting with refugees following the first shelling directed at the church.  Now, my question is the following:  These allegations made by the officer, do they correspond, or reflect the reality that you experienced at Sainte Famille?  
A.	Be it the meeting held by Dallaire or whatever, I did not participate in it personally.  I did not attend such a meeting.  As regards the said UNAMIR soldier who moved about, I have the impression that you do not know Sainte Famille.  The Sainte Famille church, or parish, is very big.  There were people who were so sad there.  There were people who'd had killed members of their families.  There were also young people who tried to gather information.  As for me, I told you that I stayed at a specific -- I stayed, or was sitting at a specific place.  I sat at that place because I had even fallen ill.  I could not go out.  

As regards the allegation that there were UNAMIR soldiers at that place, and that Dallaire came there, that was information I received and which you yourself can locate in the document you are reading.  But I did not see them. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness, for those explanations.  Now, I would like to refer to a last document.  That document has been given to Mr. Diallo.  It is entitled, quote/unquote, "Transcript of one of the parties".  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. Diallo, please show that document to the witness for identification.  Once the document is identified, I can ask my question related thereto.  
MR. DIALLO: 
Counsel, I have a question.  I received three copies of minutes, or transcripts?  Which one are you referring to?  Is that the one of **************?  And there is another one of 5th March, and yet another one.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
It is that of  ************* 1995 (sic) relating to the witness.  

We are in open session. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says Defence counsel.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You are very fast now, all of you.  Have we identified the document?  
MR. DIALLO: 
I just want to say that I've given the document -- shown the document, or given the document to the witness.  
MR. NEKUIE:
I think so, Mr. President, I believe it is the third document in your binder.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I have it, I'm just about to remind you of the speed.  Shall we observe that?  ***************** 1996; isn't that the one?  Not '95.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
That's correct, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, I do not know whether the document has been shown to the witness and identified by her.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
There is something in front of her, and we have said -- or, heard that Mr. Diallo said that he has given the document to the witness.  So let us try now.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well.  To avoid going too fast...  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Madam Witness, do you recognise that document? 
A.	I realise that I signed this document, which means that I am aware of it.  Nevertheless, I have not had time to read it.
Q.	Madam Witness, it will not be necessary for you to read it in order to answer the question I'm going to ask you.  

In this document, when you give an account of the events which happened at CELA, you expressly mentioned the name of Préfet Renzaho.  And curiously enough, when you give an account of the events which happened at Sainte Famille, you do not at all mention his name.  And the question I want to ask you is simple, and it is -- it is as follows:  Is it an omission, or did you think that it was not necessary to mention Renzaho's name?  
A.	In this document I was talking about Munyeshyaka.  Therefore I did not have to talk about Renzaho, given that I did not know where he was.  
Q.	I thank you, Madam Witness.  Madam Witness, you talked of the events of 5 June 1994 -- or, rather, 16 June 1994, which happened at night at the Saint Paul parish.  Do you know whether, before these events which happened at night, UNAMIR officers visited you in the company of Préfet Renzaho on the said 16th of June 1994?  
A.	If you please, Counsel, I would kindly request you to repeat the question.  I did not understand it clearly.  
Q.	I will do that, Madam Witness.  On the 16th of June 1994, UNAMIR officers, in the company of Mr. Renzaho, did they visit you at Sainte Famille before the occurrence of the incidents that -- before the events of what happened on the night of 16th June occurred?  
A.	I'm not aware of that.  I told you the state of my health -- I told you about the state of my health at that time.  Once more, I woke up when I learned that my child had just been killed.  It was when I went out that I saw Renzaho very near a water tank. 
Q.	Thank you very much indeed, Madam Witness.  The following day, that is, on the 16th (sic) of June 1994, during the sad event that you are talking about, did you see Colonel Munyakazi at Sainte Famille?  
A.	On the 17th?  No.  I rather saw him after the 16th (sic), but it is likely that he came to the priests' office, and it is those who were quite close to that office who saw him.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Witness, we have two different versions of what you just said.  When was it that you rather saw him?  After which date, please; can you repeat that?  
THE WITNESS: 
Who is speaking?  Or, who are you talking about?  What is your question, please?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Witness, can you hear me and recognise my voice now?  Can you hear my voice now, Madam Witness, and recognise who is speaking?  

Mr. Diallo, is there anything wrong with the witness's headset?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Mr. Diallo seems to have said:  
MR. DIALLO:
Yes, Mr. President -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Or, rather, he says:  
MR. DIALLO:
No, Mr. President, there no problem with the witness's headset.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  The question is as follows, Witness:  You just said, as an answer to a question by Defence counsel, when you saw Colonel Munyakazi.  Do you remember that you just answered a question?  Yes or no?  
THE WITNESS: 
Are you asking me if I saw Colonel Munyakazi?  I did not clearly understand your question.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You saw Colonel Munyakazi after the 16th or after the 17th?  That's the question, in essence.  We have two versions.  What did you say?  
THE WITNESS: 
After the 17th, that was when Munyakazi came to Sainte Famille.  He came in the company of the inspector, a female inspector. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says the witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
He also came with Nyirabagenzi and his escort.  But I do not think it is necessary to give all these names, because you did not ask me questions relating to the names.  The -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  You have answered the question, thank you very much indeed.  Now here follows the next question.  
(Pages 51 to 65 by Kirstin McLean)








1715H
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Madam Witness, a Prosecution witness, nevertheless, testified that on the 17th of June 1994, it was indeed Colonel Munyakazi who evacuated the last people who were still at Sainte Famille, and that he was the same person who dispersed those who were demonstrating at the Sainte Famille parish.  
What do you say to that testimony?  
A.	Please, can you ask your question again?  I did not clearly understand it. 
Q.	Yes, Madam Witness, I'm going to do that.  A Prosecution witness who appeared before this Court testified that it was Colonel Munyakazi who, on the 17th of June 1994, evacuated the last refugees from Saint Paul and dispersed those who were demonstrating at Sainte Famille.  What comments do you have to make on that testimony? 
A.	I told you that Munyakazi showed up after the 17th, and that he was accompanied by Angeline.  They said that some people had shot at them the night before.  But, as a matter of fact, they were referring to the 12 young people who had scaled the wall.  Munyakazi immediately arrested them after the priest brought them or showed them to Munyakazi.  That was the last time I saw Munyakazi. 
Q.	Very well, Madam Witness, I note that according to you, Munyakazi was not at Sainte Famille on the 17th of June 1994.  

Now, I would like to ask you a last question, Madam Witness.  Do you know a certain Vincent Mugiraneza?  Mugiraneza is spelt as follows, M-U-G-I-R-A-N-E-Z-A, Mugiraneza.  
A.	I know Mugiraneza. 
Q.	Madam Witness, do you know what happened to him in 1994, and in what circumstance that happened? 
A.	Mugiraneza was a Tutsi, and it is Renzaho who took him along.  It is Renzaho who knows where he put him. 
Q.	Very well.  Madam Witness, that was my last question and it will be followed by a message from 
Mr. Renzaho.  

Mr. Renzaho hopes that it is a sincere testimony that you are giving against him.  As far as he's concerned, he asks me to tell you in Kinyarwanda, ubuzima bwiza.  In other words, good health -- have a good wealth (sic).

U-B-U-Z-I-M-A -- further away -- B-W-I-Z-A?  

I thank you, Madam Witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
Any re-examination?  
THE WITNESS:
I thank you.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness ACK, there's one matter that I would like you to answer -- one or two questions arising from the cross-examination.  You were asked about a young man, Bitega, who you told us had whispered in your ear to go to Sainte Famille, by the gate of CELA.  Am I correct when I summarise what you have said in respect of that part of your testimony?  
A.	Could you please repeat your question?  And, please, be more precise.  
Q.	All right.  You told us that you -- that Mr. Bitega had whispered something in your ear.  Is that correct? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And where was this?  Where did this take place? 
A.	After he told us that Father Munyakazi told us that those who were afraid -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness did not complete her answer.  
THE WITNESS:
-- those who are afraid, go to Sainte Famille. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And where were you when Mr. Bitega told you that? 
A.	We were about to go out of the CELA centre and were wondering where we were going to go from there.  However, most of those who went home, died before us. 
Q.	Now, if you could listen carefully to my next question:  At the time you left CELA and went to 
Sainte Famille, had your husband and children been taken away from CELA at that point or were they still at CELA? 
A.	They had been taken to a place below, and they were being beaten up, but they had not yet left the place, as such.  As for us, we left before. 
Q.	Thank you.  And after you left, do you know where or what happened to Mr. Bitega? 
A.	I know that Mr. Bitega is still alive, but I do not know what happened to him in the meantime.  In any case, I know that he met Renzaho, that he met him very often.  
MR. MOSES: 
All right, thank you.  Those are the only matters I wanted to raise in re-examination, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, this was the end of your testimony.  Thank you very much for making yourself available to testify before the Tribunal, and we wish you all the best.  Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
I also thank you, Mr. President. 
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you to everyone far away for having facilitated this video conference.  And we can then switch off the link with the country.  

We will then look at exhibits to be tendered.  

You wanted to start with the excerpt of the judicial document, K0377662, 757, 758, and for completeness that continues to 759, 760 and 817, but those three last pages were not used.  

No objection?  
MR. MOSES: 
No, Your Honour, perhaps as a matter of clarification, what this document, in fact, is -- because I suspect it may in fact be an extract from the judgement of BUO, I -- I'm not entirely sure, but if that is the case, I understand that the document has already been entered, in which case, it would seem superfluous to re-enter it.  But, as I've only got a partial extract, I'm not entirely clear.  I -- I do see, I think, BUO's name mentioned in one of the paragraphs, which has alerted to -- me to that fact, but not being a -- being fluent in Kinyarwandan, I'm unable to say with any certainty whether this is the same document. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you help us with this, Defence?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I do not know where the Prosecution is obtaining his information.  What I know is that this document is an excerpt of the judgement of several persons.  And all I did was adopt what relates to the murder of the witness's family.  And I would like the portion that I tendered should be considered differently, otherwise there will be confusion, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question now is whether this is, indeed, a judgement, including Witness BUO, with other words, a document which has already been tendered, or whether this is a separate document, different from the previous one.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
I cannot say anything to that.  I did not have an excerpt from the judgement rendered in the BUO case.  So I found this excerpt in the course of my research, and I did not see the name BUO in the bundle of documents that I had before me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the exhibit number of BUO's judgement in this case?  
MR. MOSES: 
We don't have the Defence exhibit list with us, Your Honour.  We -- we are just going to do a quick search of the K number to see whether or not it is -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The next document --
MR. MOSES:
It does appear, Your Honour -- if I can just indicate, I am sorry -- it does appear that this does form part of the same series of K numbers in that it relates to BUO.  And I do note that BUO's name is referred to on -- I don't want to identify him -- but it is referred to.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have the judgement in hard copy there?  Mr. Matemanga has it.  Let's hold this for the time being.  

Your next document was the document of 5th March 1996?  Defence?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, indeed, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any problems with that document? 
MR. MOSES: 
I am sorry, Your Honour, I was being slightly distracted.  I was probably breaching one of your rules, but -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are now at the transcript dated 5th March '96, which is an excerpt from a judicial proceeding in a foreign country.  
MR. MOSES: 
I do have a problem with that, Your Honour, because it's a statement from a person not the witness.  The witness hasn't recognised either -- hasn't been asked to recognise the name of the person; and the contents contained, which were put to the witness, she didn't agree with.  And so there seems to be no linkage or basis for that document to be entered into evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is clear that you will have to look at Defence Exhibit D. 16 to make up your mind as to whether your first comment concerning BUO's judgement is indeed included in that document or not.  

Mr. Matemanga has this judgement here.  Could you confirm -- with other words, we are backtracking now to the first question.  Can you confirm whether you maintain that the document now being tendered, K0377662, the first document sought tendered, is indeed BUO's judgement, Defence Exhibit 16?  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, it appears that the judgement is 100 -- at least 168 pages long.  It is the same RMP number, the extract which has just been referred to, which would indicate it is from the same case.  But, to date, there are only, for some reason, four or five individual pages which have been tendered, none of which are the ones which have been referred to.  So whilst, yes, it does come from the same document, it -- they have -- those pages have yet to be tendered; in which case, we have no objection to the passages which my friend has referred to being introduced as a Defence exhibit.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Will this judgement become a complete exhibit at some stage in this case?  Should we enter the entire judgement in this context as D. 16?  Would this be a way of doing this?  The problem is that D. 16 only contains about five pages, excerpts from the judgement.  Now you are coming up with four new pages.  Would it be a possibility that the Defence says, "We will now consider all pages of that judgement to form part of D. 16 from now on," or do you prefer only to have these excerpts?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I do not understand why the Prosecution would not enable us to choose the simpler solution.  This judgement deals with 58 people.  I do not believe the whole document should be admitted when we are only interested in excerpts of this document.  I have dealt with the excerpts that are interesting to me within the framework of this testimony, and I believe it would be easier to have that portion admitted into evidence, instead of having a whole document, portions of which would not have been translated and which would cause problems to the Trial Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  You are the master of your own exhibits.  We have now established that the pages you want to tender now are different from the ones previously tendered, presumably from the same judgement.  We will admit the present five-six pages as the first Defence exhibit number.

Which is, Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 40.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there a need to do this under seal?  
MR. MOSES: 
It depends, Your Honour, because I don't know whether the passage which my friend has highlighted for the parties is also highlighted on the document being tendered.  If it's an -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Since there has been a link in court between BUO and the name in this document, we will place this under seal.  That was the first issue. 

You have now tendered that document, Defence.  
(Exhibit No. D. 40 admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The next document was this document 5th March 1996.  And, there, the Prosecution had the objection that the witness really didn't recognise the document or offer a sufficient basis.  That was the remark made by the OTP.  

Now, what is your response to that, Defence?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, the Trial Chamber will appreciate this was just a piece of material which was used for the purpose of cross-examination.  So I leave it to the Trial Chamber to determine whether this document is admissible or not.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it the view of anyone in the courtroom that the information given to the witness in any way contradicted the testimony of the witness?  
MR. MOSES: 
I don't know if you want -- who you want to go first, whether you want my friend to.  I will wait and see if my friend has any comments, and then I will comment.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President.  It is the view of the Defence that the allegation of the witness, according to which UNAMIR was not present at the church, is contradicted by these testimonies.  But I believe that the witness, in the final analysis, admitted this afternoon that she had seen members of UNAMIR there.  So this is our submission.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We cannot see that it is sufficiently established that there is a basis for admitting this document which comes from a different person than the witness, and where it is not clear that there is really a contradiction which could affect the credibility of the witness.  So that was the 5th of March '96.  

Then you had -- what is your next document, if any, Defence that you want to tender?  Maybe the document of ************* '96?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, indeed, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That should be unproblematic.  Mr. Matemanga?  

MR. MATEMANGA:
D. 41.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 41 admitted, under seal) 
MR. NEKUIE: 
I am obliged, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What remains now is to discuss the progress of this trial.  It is 5:40.  It may take more than five minutes, maybe, to discuss this issue.  The question is whether we should do this right away and get it done or whether we have to meet very briefly tomorrow.  I think the preference of Bench would be to do it immediately, if it meets with the accord of the parties.  
MR. MOSES: 
Certainly, Your Honour, I have very little to say.  I think it's really -- the ball is in the court of the Defence.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, what has been done is no longer necessary.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That was a very profound remark.  
MR. CANTIER: 
As usual, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have provisionally indicated that May would be a good time for Defence to start its case.  Would Monday the 14th of May be a good starting point?  I am suggesting that date because of courtroom availability.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, the evaluation we had carried out to this day enables me to tell you that this is a date that is likely, without it being any commitment on our part.  And I will give you the reasons why. 

Immediately after the first session, we went to the WVSS in order to further investigate this technique we were not cognisant with.  We were first told -- and this was what I conveyed to the Trial Chamber -- that two months would be necessary for the section to be able to mobilise the witness as soon as we would bring them the complete list of our witnesses.  And I recall, Mr. President, that you had stated that this was the worst-case scenario, so we tried to improve on that scenario.  

In practical terms, the problem of that section is linked to those witnesses who do not have any travel documents, witnesses who not have any identity cards, and mostly refugees, and the section cannot locate and bring these persons here in a short period.  So, Mr. President, what we have envisaged, and apparently the section is ready to comply, is that we should provide one first list to the section with witnesses who have travel documents so that they can be mobilised more rapidly; and this seems possible without keeping with the two-month delay.  If -- or, were we to give to WVSS our list of witnesses around mid-April, I believe we would indeed be able to have witnesses who would be available to testify as -- in -- as early as mid-May.  However, I wish to respectfully submit to the Trial Chamber that, for that purpose, we would need your decision regarding witness protection.  A motion was filed in this regard during the course of the month of January, and most of our witnesses consider that their protective measures are a prerequisite for their coming here.  So this is what I can tell the Trial Chamber at this stage.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So there is an undecided motion in our Chamber?  

All right; we will decide it right away.  I have overlooked that one.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, indeed.  It was a motion that was filed, unless I am mistaken, on --
MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, I believe we responded to it, agreeing to it in principle, although there are two or three paragraphs I think that we were not in agreement with, but, obviously, in general terms we were in agreement.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Such motions are absolutely routine and will be decided extremely fast.  I can -- you can rest assured.  It's simply an oversight that this has not been done earlier.  
MR. CANTIER:
This is a motion that was filed on the 17th of January.  We have been able to find the date, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  So that will be taken care of.  Thank you very much.  

How many witnesses do you think will be on your total list, and what will then be the distribution between, on the one hand, witnesses with, and, on the other hand, without travel documents?  
MR. CANTIER: 
I cannot give you any specific answer on the spot, Mr. President, because we will need to meet the witnesses.  And as you will well understand, we were not in a position to do so, up to now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We were very pleased to hear, Maître Cantier, that you think that provided that certain steps are taken that we could indeed start on the 14th of May, and we will do so then.  And we will then follow the development and see how the progress is.  We understand that you may come back to us and say that there are problems in relation to witnesses without travel documents.  But the situation may also be that, miraculously, problems are less than anticipated.  But that's something we will probably see later.  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, the situation is beyond my control. Some witnesses -- for most of the witnesses we need to go and see them and look into the matter of travel documents.  We do know at this stage that there are a number of witnesses who are in Europe and who do not have such problems.  So, what we thought, in order to share with you our reflections, is that perhaps we could start with these first witnesses, and if there were any specific difficulties that might crop up, those who would have difficulties could come subsequently.  The objective of the Defence, taking into account the wishes expressed by the Trial Chamber, being to end our session before the end of June or early July at the latest.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Let us do this.  Let me simply say in all fairness that there is a problem because of a slight possible postponement in the Military trial for the closing arguments, and there is also some problems connected with courtroom space.  But we do not have to go into that now because we do not know exactly how this will develop.  It is still a good thing now that we, in this case, decide to start on Monday the 14th with the very best intentions, and then we will see how far we can get.  
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, this is indeed our objective, and we are staying on that track, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is then the decision:  To start on the 14th.  And the specifics will be more difficult to work out.  In a provisional draft, we have put aside from the 14th of May to the 8th of June for this case.  That is four weeks.  I do not know whether that will be sufficient for the Defence case.  And it's half days.  So it's a bit short.   But much can change until June.  And, as I said, a complicating factor is closing arguments in Military I, which may steal a week here.  But this is as far as we can get today.  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, flowing from that, just looking at Rule 73 ter, which is pre-Defence conference.  I am not sure whether this falls in that category or not.  But there are obviously matters in terms of pre-Defence briefs and dates for the disclosure of statements and summaries of fact -- of other material, which I won't go through, but Your Honour will be aware of, contained in Rule 73 ter.  Now, I don't know whether Your Honour wishes to address that now or issue a written ruling, as I believe Your Honours are capable of doing under the rules, subsequent to this evening.  I don't want to delay things unnecessarily, but obviously it is important for the Prosecution to know -- and for the Defence also to know if we are starting on the 14th of May.  The normal practice is, without obviously Your Honours being bound to it, is as I understand it, 21 days prior to the commencement of the Defence case that the -- a pre-Defence brief and details of all witnesses would be given to the Prosecution.  It's one of the issues, if I can say in passing, that is in dispute in the -- the Defence application for protection of witnesses.  They were wanting a rolling disclosure, whereas we were wanting what Your Honours had indicated for us, namely, that all documents should be disclosed 21 days before the commencement of the Defence case.  But that's just to indicate one of the issues.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence?  
MR. CANTIER: 
The Defence is making calculations, Mr. President. 

Yes, indeed, if we take into account the date of May the 14th, and if the deadline for disclosure to the Prosecution is fixed at 21 days by the Trial Chamber, this will take us to the 23rd of April.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is a correct observation.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Let me continue, Mr. President.  I am thinking aloud because I must say that I do not know whether everything will be in order for us to be able to make such disclosures at that point, and there is also the matter of the pre-trial brief -- pre-Defence brief, sorry.  Can the Trial Chamber rule on this matter and mainly on the deadline for the filing of such pre-Defence brief?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This Chamber has a very established practice when it comes to these matters.  We generally lay down a deadline of 21 days before the commencement of the Defence case and we go for en bloc disclosure and not rolling disclosure.  So we could rule that right away now.  That will be the position of the Trial Chamber if we were to rule now.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, are you referring to the disclosure of testimonies?  To the Prosecution?  Am I correct?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  With other words, the deadlines in Rule 73 ter.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Of course, Mr. President.  I was wondering whether we had the obligation or whether the Trial Chamber would envisage requesting that we file a pre-Defence brief, because if my memory serves me well, it is not compulsory, but an order to that effect can be handed down by the Trial Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The concept "pre-Defence brief" is maybe not absolutely concise in nature.  What matters to the Prosecution is that you receive disclosure of unredacted witness statements; with other words, all the information, particularly enumerated in Rule 73 ter, (iii) A, B, C, D and (iv).  That's the core; that's what the Prosecution needs.  Isn't that so?  

MR. MOSES:
And I think (iv), also, Your Honour, which is a list of exhibits that the Defence wishes to introduce.  The other matters, I agree, aren't essential, though I would comment that I think it would assist the Trial Chamber and all the parties to focus on what the defence is and what they intend to be contesting.  Because there have been examples in the course of the Prosecution case where my friends have stood up and indicated such -- so-and-so fact is not in dispute. And, had it been admitted at an earlier stage, it may have saved everyone some time in terms of us having to lead matters.  So I think it focuses everyone.  Whether that be can done at a later point than the 21-day -- that might be a compromise which could assist everyone.  That if the matters contained in (iii) and (iv) were done 21 days beforehand, and the other matters at a later date, then perhaps that would assist everyone.  And, of course, a notice of alibi, if my friends intend in any way to rely on an alibi.  I don't know if that is the case.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The easier solution would be that we decided that the deadline for the requirement of Rule 73 ter is the 23rd of April, generally.  That would be a clear deadline for everything.  Would that be possible, Defence?  
MR. CANTIER: 
We are going to make every effort to comply with that deadline, Mr. President.  That is a commitment I am making.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's most helpful.  Experience has shown that sometimes it is difficult to be absolutely precise as to information of witnesses.  With other words, sometimes Defence teams provide less information to WVSS, alternatively, less information to OTP than they need.  

So a good rule of thumb here is simply to take one of the Prosecution's personal information sheets and, for each Defence witness, fill in exactly the same elements of information.  Otherwise, there will be disputes between the parties later, and the OTP will say we do not have a sufficient basis for investigating.  And, if you could, in addition to that kind of rudimentary information, sometimes give, say, relatives, for instance, parents, which would further indicate the identity of the person, that would facilitate matters.  

If there is a need for any pre-Defence conference before the 24th -- or 23rd of April, that must be indicated.  But if we do not hear anything, we would assume that everything is ready on Monday, the 23rd of April -- sorry, the 14th of May.  The 14th of May, we will assume that we can move directly into the Defence case.  

But, the Defence, if you want a pre-Defence conference, or if the Prosecution thinks that there is a need to sort out problems, then you can address the Trial Chamber.  

If there is nothing else to be said, may I then again thank both parties for their professionalism, efficiency, and elegant way of conducting the proceedings.

We have also concluded the two-three remaining minor issues during the Prosecution case. 

Again, a heartfelt, warm thanks to our registry staff, our interpreters and our court reporters for all you're doing in order to assist us in everyday life.  It's a tremendous teamwork in this courtroom.  Thank you so much.  

And then we meet again on the 14th of May.  Is there anything else to be said before we leave the courtroom?  
MR. CANTIER: 
No, Mr. President; but just to also thank all the staff who assisted us during our proceedings.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  The Court is adjourned.
