P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning; the Court is in session.  The Chamber is sitting under 15 bis this morning because Judge Arrey was not feeling quite well.  She hopes to join us later today.  

Yesterday the last issue raised before we adjourned was the need to place portions of the transcripts under separate cover.  That was done, but upon further reading, I can see that a remark by Maître Cantier, later on, could give a hint as to what was placed under separate cover.  So we will therefore, in the transcripts of yesterday, delete the words in Maître Cantier's question to Mr. Renzaho, starting with the words "when you" until the word "publicly".  And then the last sentence "you can write them", et cetera, remains in the transcript.  

Secondly, just to dispel any doubt, the fact that we noted in the courtroom that there is now communication of documents concerning Mr. Munyeshyaka, there will be no need for a response from the Prosecution.  There is an oral decision by the Chamber that the Defence motion for disclosure of those documents is moot.  So that's settled.  

Maître Cantier, you have the floor.  

Good morning, Mr. Renzaho.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And please make an attempt today to be briefer in your answers.  You see, Maître Cantier poses very specific, precise questions, and he wants points coming back, not long explanations.  

Here comes his first question.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Forgive me, Mr. President.  First of all, we should like to draw the Bench's attention to the motion for an additional witness to which we have not had a response as yet, and time is short because the section is telling us that if we don't have a rapid response, the witness will not be able to appear next week, whereas we really wanted to call that witness next week.  

Secondly, another brief comment, Mr. President, with our witnesses.  The problem with our witness -- we've just learnt that a witness who we intended to call is in Rwanda but didn't want to come because felt under threat, was the subject of an attempt -- an attempted arrest and had to flee.  It is only our team with our Rwandan investigator who had the coordinates, that witness's coordinates, and I wanted to speak about that before continuing with examination-in-chief.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Couldn't we reserve this for some later stage?  And it is now on record that this is a problem, but it will, of course, primarily be a need for a report to the registry, if it is the view of the Defence that there is a link between the attempted arrest of this person and his testimony.  
MR. CANTIER: 
It was a witness that we intended to call, and who told us that he wouldn't come.  He did not make a deposition.  And there was an inquiry undertaken by the registry, of which I think the Bench is aware.  I merely wish to state it in public.  We don't need a response from the Trial Chamber, but it's serious enough for us to bring it up at the time when we have heard about it.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We understood that the person had not testified.  The only point now is that there will be a need for an administrative follow-up in addition to stating it for the record as you did now in the courtroom.  Thank you for drawing our attention to that now.  

As regards the awaited decision on the additional witness, the Bench is aware of that.  We have been in touch with the witness protection unit to know when a decision has to be rendered, should we grant the motion.  But, on the other hand, we also wanted to give the Prosecution some time in order to see whether this could be solved in a way before the Chamber rules on it.  And we will come back to the Prosecution later today and hear updated views on the motion, in view of the fact that you have had some more time, even if the information came late and not in conformity with the 21 days rule.  

So we promise to come back to you on that, Maître Cantier, as soon as possible.  

Let us begin.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. President.
THARCISSE RENZAHO,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued) 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, yesterday, before we adjourned, I was asking you what decision had been taken in respect of the urban security committee meeting on the 8th of April.  You began to speak of it.  Could you summarise for us the main decisions taken that day?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I was summarising the decisions taken as reestablishing the communal authority over the situation, because things were falling apart.  Secondly, we (unintelligible) that we were opposed to wildcat roadblocks; and thirdly, absolutely resist killing and disorder in all parts of the city.  And fourthly, since we were not very numerous, many people had gone, were in hiding, we had to use the few staff we had rationally so as to respond to the needs of the people, and I, to that purpose, set up the crisis unit which would follow things full time, and a number to call in case of distress was given to the citizenry that they might, in case of need, call the préfecture for assistance.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I want to put a specific question to you:  The crisis committee -- the crisis unit -- cell, crisis cell, who was it composed of, and what was that cell's task?  
A.	The cell was composed of myself, the bourgmestre who was present, and other bourgmestres if they came forward would join it, Mr. Butera, and Mr. Bisanukuli, who was the secretary with the secretarial staff available to him.  And they had the telephone of the préfecture secretariat to receive the calls from members -- from citizens in -- with problems, in distress.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, can you tell us, at this point, what was UNAMIR's role in respect of maintenance of public order and safety?  
A.	Counsel, before answering that question I think I have not said that there were technical commissions.  We set up technical commissions to undertake activities on the ground.  Because the crisis cell was at the préfecture, who heard requests and examined the situation, but there were technical commissions who were intended to go out and act.  There was the -- I'll mention them quickly.  

There was the administrative commission in charge of distribution of documents, laissez-passers, or to help people who lost their identification papers; and then there was the social affairs commission that was responsible for (unintelligible) and assistance to refugees; the infrastructure commission which was responsible for supply of water and electricity; and the logistics and supply commission, which handled logistical problems and the organisation of supplies to Kigali town.  And then there was a police detachment which was ready to intervene at any time; they were ever ready to assist people in danger.  Those were the commissions that helped the cell do its work.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And now you have to spell the other name after Mr. Butera.  Can you do that, please?  Or do we have it on the list?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President.  Number 66, 66.  And the other name was 43, Bisanukuli.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  And now the answer to Maître Cantier's question about UNAMIR's role, Mr. Renzaho.  
THE WITNESS: 
I would ask him to put the sentence again -- put the question again.  I have fragments of it in mind, but I don't remember exactly.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	What was UNAMIR's role within the PVK perimeter with regard to maintenance of public order and safety before the events of the 6th of April?  And then I'll ask you about after the 6th of April, and in the period from the 6th of April to the 5th of July.  So, first of all, before the 6th of April.  
A.	Thank you.  UNAMIR's role in maintaining public order and safety in Kigali town before the 6th of April was, first of all, to watch over -- watch out for circulation of armament within the framework of the KWSA agreement, the Kigali weapon-free area, so as to ensure a serene atmosphere for establishing the transitional institutions.  Therefore all military camps, all gendarmerie camps, were under the effective control of UNAMIR units who monitored the movement of weaponry, including lists of troops guarding the camps, and who held the keys to the arsenals and weapons stores, munition stores.  And so that -- for that purpose, UNAMIR might set up mobile roadblocks on the main roads in Kigali to check whether weapons were moving or not.  

And as regards to the safety of the citizenry, patrols were held -- organised on a regular basis, and UNAMIR troops would undertake motorised patrols in the various neighbourhoods of the town.  And we experienced that system, that arrangement, from January up to the 6th of April 1994.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Renzaho.  Now my question is:  How did those UNAMIR activities, in the field of safety -- public safety, security, how did they coordinate with you in your capacity as head of the PVK, with regard to public order and safety?  
A.	Counsel, thank you for your question.  I am sorry to say so here, but I was not involved in how -- how the situation was organised and managed by UNAMIR.  They alone set up their work plan, and they had a gendarmerie unit which was supposed to help them.  The préfecture was in no way involved.  And to illustrate what I am saying, I'd like to refer to a public safety meeting organised at Kigali urban préfecture, at my request called by the minister of the interior, to try and clarify the situation.  

In the period in question, we had a very deteriorated safety -- public safety situation, and the threat was exponential, and it was absolutely necessary to clear things up.  And I remember that that meeting was organised at the préfecture, presided by the minister of the interior, in the presence of the minister of defence, in the presence of General Dallaire, Colonel Marchal, and the two chiefs of general staff.  The préfecture was already -- was also involved and these matters were discussed.  Numerous matters were discussed -- raised and discussed by councillors, and I think even the chefs de cellule had been summoned to the meeting.  So there was quite a few people.  

But I regret that the decisions taken at that time were not applied because our problems were not solved.  It was accepted that UNAMIR patrols would continue -- they would continue in various neighbourhoods, in association with certain patrols by the citizenry in difficult -- in hot spots, such as Bilyogo, where there'd been problems, for example, after the assassination of a party activist which had stirred up the population, and we had a difficulty.  And also in Gikondo.  That was the situation, and I sincerely regret there was no relational framework making it possible for me to indeed be involved in UNAMIR's decision-making process, with an eye to what was the facts on the ground among the citizenry at the time.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
When was that meeting?  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  If my memory serves me well, the meeting was on the 3rd of February 1994. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Bilyogo was number 41.  What was the other location you mentioned?  Please repeat it.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you.  I spoke of Gikondo.  G-I-K-O-N-D-O.  
MR. CANTIER: 
It's number 129, Mr. President.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, to illustrate what you're saying, did you learn of a United Nations report by Mr. Booh-Booh on the situation in Kigali, and the presence in Kigali town of United Nations troops?  It's a report of -- dated the 5th of April 1994.  
MR. CANTIER: 
This is the document you referred to yesterday morning, the outgoing code (unintelligible) -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The witness -- counsel states in English. 
MR. CANTIER: 
-- which we gave in separately from the lists and the files.  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I remember it.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Do you remember paragraph D, K0080228, entitled "Kigali sector"?  Do you remember, Mr. Renzaho, the extracts?  
A.	Vaguely, but perhaps you could refresh my memory because I don't have it all.  
Q.	So I will read it in English, and I beg the Chamber's indulgence for my English.  

"Three hundred fifty-one vehicles and 65 (unintelligible) -- foot (unintelligible) in Kigali in order to ensure Kigali weapon secure area established daily six checkpoints at -- at different places in KWSA.  Random patrols and checkpoints -- and checkpoint saturation monitored by force HQ."  

Mr. Renzaho, can you tell us what you think what those figures -- do those figures match what you observed on the ground?  
A.	Well, I don't know if all the vehicles were in Kigali, but I know that UNAMIR units were approximately 2,500.  Now, how -- those forces had to cover the whole territory -- in fact, not all the territory, but mainly in Kigali and in the demilitarised zone, the buffer zone, as it was called, but with observation points in other préfectures.  And what you said, what you read in the report concerns -- is what the normal deployment of UNAMIR was.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, let's come back to the situation before the 6th of April -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And just for the record, the understanding, then, seems to be that in this document, which is an outgoing code cable from Booh-Booh to Annan dated the 5th of April 1994, on page 4 of 9 pages, under section D for David, the introductory sentence refers to the fact that UNAMIR has conducted 351 vehicle and 67 foot patrols.  That must be the meaning of these technical abbreviations in the text.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Quite, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Sorry for interrupting you, Maître Cantier.  Please proceed with your question.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Renzaho, my question was:  What did UNAMIR do in the field of competence you shared with it to fulfil its task after the 6th of April, in the evening and in the following days?  
A.	I regret to tell the Trial Chamber that, contrary to what usually occurred, the UNAMIR troops did not undertake foot patrols in the neighbourhoods.  And it is inexplicable in view of the fact that I learned -- I read the -- the report of that meeting organised at Rwandan army general staff HQ in the night of the 6th to the 7th, where it was recommended that mixed patrols of UNAMIR and the gendarmerie be rapidly organised in all neighbourhoods of the city, so as to prevent disturbances in those difficult times.  And the -- it was not done.  

That was confirmed to me when I took part in the meeting at the École supérieure militaire at the ESM on the 7th.  General Dallaire came a bit later at about 11 a.m., and he was given the floor to speak to the participants.  And in his speech, or in his statement he said two things:  

"The situation, as it is, concerns you, the unit commanders.  You must take control of your units and face up to the situation."  

And the second thing was:  

"Don't expect from us to do anything.  I gave -- I have ordered -- given the order not to move our troops."  

So, the reason for not fulfilling what had been decided at the meeting -- decided at the meeting was the responsibility of the UNAMIR commanders.  I don't know if I've answered your question. 
Q.	Yes, Mr. Renzaho, you've answered the question.  But I should nonetheless like you to tell the Trial Chamber, in concrete terms, on the ground, what did UNAMIR do?  Did it do anything, still in respect of maintaining public order and safety, or did it fulfil other missions?  But what concerns us is public order and safety in the capital -- capital city.  
A.	Thank you.  What I observed, and it must be true, as of the evening of the 6th of April 1994, UNAMIR forces began to concentrate, and several reports mention that fact.  So that means that the normal activities of controlling the neighbourhoods and keeping watch over the population was not done.  The concentration continued -- accelerated, and I am obliged to regret the unilateral withdrawal, because at other times we mention the presence -- or, other witnesses here mentioned that there were three armies in Kigali.  There were procedures, rules of engagement, a certain coordination.  

And the events accelerated after the 6th with apparently no person at the helm, no captain at the helm.  And the strategic positions that were in Kigali were abandoned and, of course, then occupied -- taken over by the RPF.  So the safety -- public safety situation, the security situation, could only deteriorate.  And that favoured the advance of the RPF.  That's what I saw.  That's what I observed and took note of.  Thank you, Counsel.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, did you try to request UNAMIR presence in particular places on particular occasions because you wanted it to intervene to ensure the safety of the citizenry?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Yes, I did try.  I tried unsuccessfully.  The first case concerned, at that time, the evacuation of the orphanage in Gisenyi -- the Gisenyi (sic) orphanage in Nyakabanda secteur.  And we requested -- we asked that the orphanage that had provided shelter to many people be evacuated, and to that end we needed sufficient force that could impose itself with certain moral authorities.  It was accepted, but the next day there were problems and I did not see it actually effectively implemented.  It would be done later -- it was done later, but not at the time.  

And the second case was the Saint Paul-Sainte Famille, the place constantly shelled by the RPF from its positions in Kacyiru.  And you can -- it's very visible -- Saint Paul is very visible from there, and I'd asked that a detachment at least of UNAMIR observers be put there, that the UN flag might fly there to prevent the shelling.  But that also wasn't done.  I had difficulties in finding sufficient troops, so it wasn't done.  But we did organise together operations to exchange refugees between belligerents, which operations managed to save many people, and also at certain times convoys encountered difficulties.  But I think that's it.  
Q.	We'll come back to that.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Number 136, Mr. President, the name of the orphanage.  Gissimba.  One-three-six.
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, let's come back to your schedule those days, up to the 11th of April.  It was -- these were the decisive days as regards your roles. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Gissimba, 136.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Can you tell us what were the salient points up to the 8th of April 1994?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  On the 8th of April of 1994 -- 
Q.	In the afternoon, since we spoke about the meeting you held in the morning with the urban security council.  So my specific question has to do with the afternoon of the 8th.  
A.	In the afternoon, immediately after the meeting, I asked my colleague, Butera, Jean Baptiste, to compile information which reported on the meeting we had just held.  And there was an emergency in that the different committees were to be made up -- or, set up and were to be given their duties.  So I asked him to do this organisation work.  And I went to Kanombe; I went to see my family.  And upon my return, I asked Butera to give the phone number that we had heard on Radio Rwanda in case of danger, and that was all.  I do not recall having participated in any other activity.  I do not recall whether I attended a crisis committee meeting during that evening, but those were the main activities that I carried out during that afternoon.  
Q.	So, Mr. Renzaho, you just told us that you went to see your family on the 8th of April in the afternoon in Kanombe.  What was the situation along the way in the centre of Kigali up to Kanombe?  
A.	Thank you very much.  Strangely enough, I did not come across any roadblocks manned by the population along the road since I used the main road, the Avenue de l'armée, passing by the Hôtel des Mille Collines, then I turned in front of la Rwandaise, and next to the roundabout I used the OAU boulevard.  In Gikondo there was a roadblock manned by soldiers which I passed through, Gikondo (unintelligible) and Gikondo Rwandex, there was also another roadblock manned by soldiers, and I continued on my way without coming across any other roadblock, up until I reached Kanombe.  There was fighting, I could hear shelling explosions in the Kimihurura secteur and further down towards Kacyiru.  That is what I can say.  
Q.	How was your family and how was the state of your house when you reached Kanombe? 
A.	When I reached Kanombe, I was first of all impressed by the number of people who were at my residence.  The house had not been touched or bombed, because no bombs had fallen next to it as of yet.  My family, of course, was in a state of panic.  The children were afraid and the mother was crying, and when she saw me she said that it seemed that there were very serious things going on and people had come to seek refuge here, and there had been some killings in the neighbourhood.  I went to see the people who had fled and who had come to my house.  I spoke to them, and it was obvious that everyone was frightened, extremely frightened.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Renzaho.  Let us now move on to a very important question which has to do -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Renzaho, did you say that you passed by Gikondo and Gikondo Rwandex; was that the testimony?  

THE WITNESS: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I said that I passed by Gikondo Rwandex. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Renzaho, did you give the order that roadblocks be set up?  
A.	No. 
Q.	During the meeting that took place at the urban security committee on the morning of the 8th of April, was such a decision made?  
A.	No.  On the contrary, we noted that roadblocks had been set up in an haphazard manner in the town, and that no administrative authority had any control over those roadblocks.  I requested that the officials try to control the situation in the cellules, in the secteurs, in the communes.  That was what I did.  But, prior to that, people would do as they pleased.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, still a specific question:  Did the government ever decide to set up such roadblocks, and was such a decision conveyed to you?  
A.	I note, Counsel, that the announcement of the president's death led to the disbandment of the government.  That was what I noted.  Some ministers tried to flee as they could, and they sought refuge in embassies.  Others who did have some protection were killed.  And this remains a mystery to me to this day, but they died.  They were killed.  So when the officers met on the 7th at the military school, as I told you, there was nothing.  In any case, I was never told that two or three ministers met somewhere and carried out any action.  So, as far as I'm concerned, I doubt, and I even deny, that any member of the government ever requested the population to set up roadblocks during that period.  
Q.	Very well, Mr. Renzaho.  In the same vein, since we're all aware of the importance of this subject, I wish to ask you the following question even though you have already answered it partially.  Let me ask you when the roadblocks appeared or were set up in the town of Kigali.  
A.	Well, I believe the first roadblocks were set up in the secteurs that were close to the RPF headquarters.  And that was done during the night from the 6th to the 7th.  And then with the ongoing attack of the RPF in the afternoon of the 7th, a number of other roadblocks were set up.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, since you have just stated that it was not the government who gave the order to set up roadblocks, and since you have just testified that you did not give such an order at the PVK, who took the initiative to set up those roadblocks in the town of Kigali?  
A.	Counsel, I would be hard-pressed to tell you who took the initiative to set up those roadblocks, because I don't know.  However, since I lived in that city during the period in question, let me give you a few (unintelligible) that will show you that the phenomenon is not as surprising as one might think.  

Throughout the war there were crisis periods during which the political parties, or the youth wings, or through actions that were carried out through the city led to the anger of the population.  So that sometimes you would use a road, and upon your return you would find that same road blocked.  In order to give an example of what I'm saying, let me tell you about the -- the example of the road leading from the Kigali hospital to Nyamirambo, which was closed in May of 1993.  The population had set up a roadblock on that road because there had been deaths in the Rwampara secteur.  And since I followed this matter, people wished to protest against insecurity, and especially against the fact that there was nothing one could do to improve the security situation.  When I went there, people told me, "Well, you are the préfet.  If you are not able to ensure security, just go away and find someone who can do the job, who's more important."  That is what they told me.  They told me that they were looking for the minister of national defence.  I told them that they were exaggerating somewhat.  

But, in the final analysis, I thought it was necessary to go and look for the minister of defence, who was kind enough to come to the location to talk to the population.  And it was only then that they accepted to dismantle the roadblock.  And we followed the population to that place where three people had been killed by unknown people, but the killings were attributed to the RPF.  So they asked that a patrol be based on -- in that location, and a decision was made by the minister to do so forthwith.  So this is an example which gives you the context.  

If we go to the period which followed the assassination of Gatabazi and Bucyana in February, and subsequently of Mr. Ingabire -- Katumba -- in March, then I can tell you that it was not only Kigali that came under attack, but the whole country.  There were roadblocks that were set up, but there were also other people who were killed.  There were refugees.  When the events of the 6th of April 1994 occurred, we had centres in Kigali which were sheltering refugees who had come at the time of the events I mentioned.  So the events that occurred after the death of the president was announced are not surprising for anyone who has been able to follow the security situation in Kigali.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And when was this event involving the minister of defence?  
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, thank you very much.  I do not have the precise date.  I believe it was in May of 1993.  And the incident that took place on the same day -- and which might be a good indicator because we will probably be able to find it somewhere in the documentation, on that same day there was an attack at the Kigali central post office.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We heard you say May 1993.  That was the evidence?  
THE WITNESS: 
I referred to the month of May of 1993; is that correct.  Because the minister I was referring to was Minister Gasana, James, who was still holding that position at the time.  

BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, when did you learn -- or, when did you understand that the roadblocks were used in order to sort out and kill people who were targeted because of their ethnicity or because of their political leanings?  
A.	Counsel, I observed that there was anarchy everywhere, and that from the outset.  But, until then, before the 10th which was the day when there was a massive influx of displaced persons from Nyacyonga, the situation was serious but had not deteriorated too much.  So I became aware of that after the 10th of April of 1994.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Number 409.  Yes?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, indeed, Mr. President.  
THE WITNESS:  
Counsel, if I may, I wish to add a few words:  I do not believe that these criminals thought that the victim was a political opponent.  But -- and what I tried to explain yesterday, I have a feeling that all these people believed that anybody who was involved in the war or who had any contact with the RPF were the enemy.  Thank you.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, are you aware of the existence of a document issued by UNAMIR?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, this is number 1 on our list number 4, a document dated 3rd of May of 1994, which is also in English only, and which refers to an incident which took place on that day in Kigali on the occasion of the evacuation of refugees at the Mille Collines hotel.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, did -- are you aware of the existence of this document, and do you remember this incident, Mr. Renzaho, on the 3rd of May of 1994?  And if your answer is in the affirmative, could you, in a few words, say what occurred on that day and what part you played?  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  I witnessed this incident.  There was a convoy that had been organised by UNAMIR for 72 or more Tutsi refugees who were being transferred towards the RPF-controlled area.  And the incident occurred at the level of the passover at the street light located at the place called Akanogo (sic), not far from the Sopecya station.  I don't know whether this station still exists, but that was the exact, precise location where the event took place. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, let me interrupt you for a moment in order to give the spelling of the names you referred to.  
MR. CANTIER:
Kanogo is number 216 on the list, and Sopecya is number 540.  

BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	You may proceed, Mr. Renzaho.  
A.	So, it was in the afternoon -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you say 216?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Two hundred and sixteen, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Two-one-six?  All right.  
THE WITNESS: 
It was in the afternoon, I was at the office.  A delegation of soldiers came to tell me that there was a very serious problem at that location, and they were asking for my assistance in order to solve the matter.  I was not aware of the operation, and I thought it was necessary to do something, since the incident had occurred.  So I went to the location, and when I arrived I saw a very large crowd -- a very large, overexcited crowd with a few members of UNAMIR.  And I tried to talk to the mob, but I could not find anyone to address in that crowd.  I could not find anyone.  I was trying to find someone I could talk to.  

The crowd was getting more and more agitated, and by chance one of the members of the group asked the crowd to listen to me in a loud voice.  It is only after I identified him that I took him aside and asked him to find three or four people representing the group, and we stayed on the side in order to talk.  I asked them why they were there, why they were overexcited, and what they wanted.  And they told me that refugees from one side only were being transferred in a unilateral manner when they were -- they were aware of the fact that people who were in the centres under the control of the RPF were selected and killed, and that others were forcibly transferred towards Byumba where they were also sorted out and killed.  So that was the problem as they put it to me.  

I tried to make them understand that the authorities were -- would only get involved in situations that would be to the benefit of the populations, and that no authority would ever plan any activity that we -- would be detrimental to the population.  And that my mere presence was enough for them to understand that I was there to protect their interests, and that whatever I was to request from them, they should do.  Then they asked me whether I would be in a position to bring back their parents or friends who were on the other side.  I solemnly promised that I would do my best for the exchanges to take place in such a way that those who were in the RPF-controlled area who wished to go to the government side could do so, and that those who were on the government-controlled side, wishes to go to the RPF side, also be able to do so.  That was the best solution.  

The discussion took quite a while, and the crowd was getting more and more excited, since we were not able to convey our decisions to the crowd.  We finalised our discussion and we agreed that we would inform the population that the convoy would go back to the Hôtel des Mille Collines for the simple reason that it was night already and it was clear that the operation could not be finalised successfully.  And we also informed them that we would agree on a day when people would come from both sides and the -- the transfer would take place in the open.  So they accepted the proposal, and I asked the man who appeared to be the leader of the mob to come with me in order to inform the crowd of the decision we had just made.  And the crowd calmed down.  

We had to take action swiftly.  I asked that vehicles -- in the meantime other people came, there was the general chief of staff and other people who joined the initiative.  And we asked the convoy to retrace its way.  The convoy went back to the Hôtel des Mille Collines.  I remained there with the crowd because of a young woman that they had abducted, and I fought in order to be able to save that girl.  They tried to intimidate me, they fired shots, but I was able to seize that girl from them.  We were able to leave the location, and that is what happened when that incident occurred.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Renzaho.  This is an example you have just given on the situation that prevailed and those roadblocks.  Now let me put a specific question to you:  What measures did you take in order to dismantle the roadblocks?  Or, if you were not able to do so, to ensure security in these locations?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I attempted to remove the roadblocks, but I wasn't strong enough to force compliance with my decision.  In my -- that decision fell in the communiqué on the 10th.  I wanted that, at least in daytime, the roadblocks be removed so that the citizens might move around to fetch supplies, go to the hospital.  And it was fortuitous, because in that brief period of time there was relative calm which, of course, was completely destroyed by an intensive shelling on -- on the populated districts, the markets, the hospitals -- anything.  Completely uncontrolled, wild shelling.  And the decision was of no consequence, of course.  

But as regards the control of the roadblocks, I consistently stressed -- insisted that the communal authorities should be involved and should ensure the proper control to avoid that there be excesses and brutalities by the people manning those roadblocks.  I did that in the course of meetings with the bourgmestres, and for the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge, he'd bring his conseillers along.  I also did so through my various appeals, messages, communiqués.  

But I think the people already in Kigali at the end of April was nothing like the inhabitants of Kigali on the 6th of April.  Because many people had come from outside, fleeing the fighting, the atrocities, they'd swollen the city's population, and they were not encarded, those people, and they didn't obey anyone.  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
This communiqué of the 10th, do we have that in the file?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I was on the point of reading some extracts to Mr. Renzaho.  It's Exhibit P. 49.  I was going, just now, to propose reading some parts of it to Mr. Renzaho, Mr. President, should you have any particular question.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Renzaho, because this question is essential:  What did you do?  What did you say?  Do you remember the words of your radio appeal, communiqué of the 10th of April 1994?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I don't have all the points in mind, but all of them were in the -- normalising the situation.  
MR. CANTIER: 
It's P. 49 in the English, page 5, K0357183 -- 357183.  And we have a French translation on the last page, which I shall read.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	So, Mr. Renzaho, this communiqué, point 3:  

"The roadblocks erected and manned by the population in the neighbourhoods is not allowed.  They can be erected at night under the authority of the local authorities."  

Is that what you were referring to a moment ago? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel.  
Q.	Is it also in this document that you incite -- you encourage the civil servants to return to their desks, to their place of work? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  And I was the first to be concerned.  
Q.	I will remind you of point 5:  "The préfet urges the population to resist all troublemakers, looters, bandits, killers, and all types of criminals who are threatening the lives of other innocent people", and appeals to the population to denounce those criminals to those responsible for security.  Is that indeed what you stated in that communiqué, Mr. Renzaho?  
A.	Yes, that is correct, Counsel.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, what did you do to arrest the criminals whom you -- whom you referred to in this communiqué?  
A.	It's true, I tried to do something to arrest these criminals.  And that's what I asked the various authorities -- because you must understand, everyone has their role to play all the way down the social ladder.  But I think in the meeting on the 8th I stressed the need to be firm against the criminals, all those who were attacking others and disturbing public order and safety.  And we would always be using the small number of policemen we had.  But, as I tell you -- as I told you, in Kigali town we had here and there territorial brigades -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
I think he's referring to gendarmerie. 
THE WITNESS: 
-- who would cooperate with the conseiller to the extent that things could take place normally.  But these were difficult times and -- but people did what they could to eradicate the evil that was abroad.  But, with the war, I felt that the orders given, the possibilities that normally would exist completely evaporated.  To begin with, the authorities, the grass roots authorities either were in hiding or fled -- and fled, or -- well, I don't know.  People are made differently.  There might even be some who ceded to private interests.  I don't know what motivated them, but the structure did not function.

1015H 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, forgive me for interrupting, but I have a specific question.  And, before doing so, the President wished to speak.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have now read the communiqué of the 10th of April, but in his testimony he said that he gave similar messages to avoid the problems at roadblocks -- or dismantled them on various occasions.  Are you going to lead us through other documents, Maître Cantier?  And how many such documents are there?  Just give us an overview.  
MR. CANTIER: 
I am sorry, Mr. President, I am having a problem with my earphones.  Let me repeat what you asked to be sure that's what you mean.  

You have asked me whether I have other documents to use as to Mr. Renzaho's appeals for dismantling the roadblocks or for ceasing the killing at the roadblocks.  Yes, Mr. President, I have other documents which I intend to use shortly.  In fact, these documents are other communiqués and occasions on which Mr. Renzaho spoke on the radio at that time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But we are now getting a rather elaborate answer from Mr. Renzaho.  It would be very interesting if you, in a concise and precise way, could lead us through these documents so that we have them on record.  Would that be a good approach now?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, I thought of developing somewhat differently, but I could go straight to it to move ahead rapidly.  On the same subject, I come to what Mr. Renzaho said.  I am trying to find it because I hadn't planned for just now.  But we found in the archives that he spoke on radio on the 14th of April, the 27th of April and the 6th of May 1994.  

Now, Mr. President, to organise this regarding the exhibits we already have the recording of the 6th -- of the 14th of April 1994.  That is Exhibit P.  51, and two other documents, not yet admitted.  Mr. Renzaho -- what Mr. Renzaho said on the radio on the 27th of April in our bundle -- in our document number 45; it's the second series of tabs in volume 1.  And then we have the 6th of May 1994, which is in volume 1 of the Defence document number 46, seventh set of tabs number 16, one-six.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  But that was helpful because now we have in a concise form four documents in relation to a particular subject matter.  If you feel that you want a slightly different approach, that's fine, but it would be good just to have this on paper, and you have now provided the references.  Thank you for doing so.  
So now you can follow your own logic, if you prefer that.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Well, yes, I prefer, because that's the way I have organised myself.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, you have already partly answered the question, but before that I wonder whether you can -- my question was:  What did you do to arrest the perpetrators of the killing?  More precisely, can you give us examples of arrests of killers, presumed killers, that you were able to effect?
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Yes, let me give you the example, the case of Kigingi -- it must be a name, a nickname, one of the nicknames.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Number 248 on the list, a nom de guerre. 
THE WITNESS:
He was among the killers in Nyamirambo.  I had asked the bourgmestre to arrest him for some time, but he hadn't done so, and I had to intervene to get him arrested.  We locked him up.  We put him in a lockup.  His supporters invaded the préfecture.  Before that I had arrested another one, Sukari, whom we kept for a while.  There was also a gang we had arrested in Rugunga cellule where they were terrorising the local population.  That gang was armed, and we disarmed them and we put them in the préfecture's lockup, in the jail, the cells, for a few days.  But our difficulty was to establish dockets.  There was no judicial institution functioning in Kigali.  My efforts to get the prosecutor's office to function led nowhere.  And I should like to add that Kigali central prison had deserted -- gone.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
Mr. Renzaho, you mentioned two occasions when people were arrested.  Who specifically carried out these arrests?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I sent policemen from the préfectoral detachment to go and get those people.  The policemen were a detachment established at the préfecture who went off to get those people. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And when was the arrest of Kigingi, and when was the arrest of Sukari?  Just give us very briefly the dates now or approximate periods.  
THE WITNESS:
I think that Kigingi was arrested in May; there was fighting in Nyamirambo.  And Sukari -- well, it must be in the second half of April, towards the end.  Whereas the others was in the middle of the month of May 1994.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
Those two persons, were they local residents or they came from a different part of Rwanda?  
THE WITNESS:
I think that Kigingi and Sukari were among those young people that we called town boys.  In fact, one came from Gisenyi, the other from Ruhengeri.  They were sort of itinerant traders.  I don't think they were necessarily considered to be residents of Kigali.  But these are people who spent the best part of their time visiting the town. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And these two events, are these the two events where you ordered arrests of perpetrators or did you do that also on other occasions?  
THE WITNESS:
Well, I don't remember well having done it on other occasions, it was specific cases brought to my attention where I intervened.  

And I think that the problem, Your Honours, is that in a situation of disturbance, where crimes have been committed, to act, the one who decides -- who has to decide to act needs information.  He must be told the specific place a crime is being committed.  If he doesn't have means of communication in respect of the crime being committed, how can he act?  That is the problem.  

Because I am very humble, before such a situation one has nothing to say one is completely -- I want to be sincere with you.  Every case brought to my attention I acted on.  To explain the difficulty of communication with the grass roots where the various crimes were being committed -- the various things being done --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does that mean that there were only on -- only two occasions, then, on which your attention was drawn to specific individuals carrying out illegal acts?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I think that other cases required presence on the ground, not necessarily to arrest people, take them away, but to settle the crisis by negotiation with people.  And the incident was over without any excesses being committed but -- and that sort of thing we knew of.  But people in -- in the act of committing, no I don't think we were. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Renzaho, we have some difficulty understanding how this situation, thousands -- tens of thousands of crimes being committed, were you not able to seek out or to have -- sort out the perpetrators of the crimes?  That is what we are wondering -- I am wondering about.  And it leads me to put the question to you:  How is it that you couldn't -- that you could intervene on those rare occasions? 
A.	Well, Counsel, I believe this is proof of the anarchy that was reigning.  We had indicators of what was truly happening -- if we had indicators of what was truly happening, we could have carried out actions using the scarce resources that were at my disposal.  But the situation was such that nobody knew what the other was doing.  What other means did I have at my disposal in order to know what was happening at the grass roots, if not the administrative structure?  In the situation in which it was in April, May and June of 1994, was that administrative structure operational?  That is the question.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I shall come to that matter subsequently and you will be able to respond at that time.  But before we do so, Mr. Renzaho; so, on this issue of the arrests, you told the Trial Chamber a moment ago that at least on one occasion -- and I believe it was the example of the arrest of Kigingi -- there was a throng of people that had come to the PVK.  Could you be more specific?  What is a friendly crowd, a hostile crowd?  What happened on that occasion?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel, it was an overexcited crowd which was quite violent and wanted to storm into the administration building and destroy everything.  We contained the crowd, even though it was quite difficult to do so, and it was difficult to restore order.  With the very few policemen at my disposal, I could not ask them to engage in an unequal battle.  And what would it have led to?  What would have been the positive effects?  I negotiated with them and they left.  So that was the situation in which we were.  
Q.	But, Mr. Renzaho, how many policemen did you have at your disposal in order to face the mob?  And how many people were there?  Were they armed?  Please be specific in order to for us to understand.  
A.	I did not have many policemen at my disposal, because every day at first assembly there would be a few policemen and there would not be that many of them.  Every day there were events that required the presence of a few policemen.  So if there were a few policemen remaining at the préfecture, they were not that numerous.  There were maybe 11 people who were available at the préfecture, and they were the people we could use if interventions were necessary.  

Now, as regards the crowd, it was a very large crowd.  There were more than a hundred people and some of them were armed; others had clubs, and so on and so forth.  So it was a mob, and this was a mob which was fighting and this would have been led to a lot of damage at the préfecture.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
There were up to 250 police officers in Kigali, you explained yesterday.  Then, on 6th of April, only 45 reported to duty, so there were about 200 who'd either deserted or at least did not show up.  Now, from the 6th of April until July, is it then the testimony that the number was about 45, the total force, or did it increase?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, if a few other policemen were able to come to the préfecture, they were not many because people who were asked to protect conseillers or other people would desert.  They would disappear, or they were killed.  

But, Mr. President, if I may, I wish to provide clarifications on the 250 policemen.  (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and filed under separate cover) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will delete that answer, the last sentence starting with "My impression is" until "..then a hundred" and place that under separate cover.  

Do you remember what we discussed yesterday, Mr. Renzaho?  
THE WITNESS:
I forgot, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Court video booth, please do not transmit that sequence.  

All right.  But, leaving aside that element, your point is that there were not more than a hundred.  Is that the evidence, not 250?  
THE WITNESS:
Not more than a hundred who had weapons, the others were not armed and were posted in specific facilities, important facilities throughout town in order to guard them.  And the other part would replace policemen who were either on leave in order to guard the weapons and in order to enable each of the policemen to have a weapon.  So I am not surprised that when the events occurred those people who did not have weapons thought it better for them to remain at home, if, of course, they had not been killed.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
Mr. Renzaho, and those two persons arrested, did they belong to Hutu or Tutsi ethnicity?  
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, they were Hutus.  They were Hutus.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, referring once again to your appeals, we were able to find several of your appeals and to take them in the chronological order.  The first one was made on the 14th of April of 1994.  
MR. CANTIER:
And, as I was stating previously, Mr. President, this is Exhibit P. 51. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	In that document you mention at length -- 
MR. CANTIER:
Because the problem, Mr. President, Your Honours, is that this is not a communiqué but is, rather, an interview on the radio, which is quite lengthy and which deals mainly with the security situation in the town of Kigali.  I have selected an excerpt from this interview, which I believe will be of interest to the Trial Chamber.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, in the French version, it is document K0264711, the last page.  I do not have the page in English.  

MR. CANTIER:
Could my learned friend from the Prosecution -- or, is my learned friend from the Prosecution there?  I would not wish to lose him, because I do not have the K number for the English version of this text.
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I wish to read out this paragraph to you, and I quote. 

"According to the directives given, the roadblocks set up on this road are to be dismantled.  Those who set them up should be prosecuted and severely sanctioned."  

It is a specific road, perhaps you could tell us which road it was.  And do you confirm, Mr. Renzaho, that you made such a statement on this day, that is to say, the 14th of April of 1994.  
A.	Yes, Counsel, let me say that this must be the road from the Muhima roundabout to the Nyarugenge fire (sic) light. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, there are other excerpts, and I am referring more specifically to page 21 of the said document.  Still in it's French version, K0264707, second paragraph, and I quote:

"I wish to seriously caution some small groups that are continuing to perpetrate shameful acts in some locations.  I wish to inform you that guidelines were issued to those who are charged with the enforcement of the security to severely punish those that will be caught in the act of looting and killing."   

Mr. Renzaho, do you remember having made such a statement?  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, there are also other excerpts because, once again, I am taking them from the radio transcript of the 27th April of 1994, for which I provided references earlier on, and I wish to refer to page K0337586, fourth paragraph, and I quote:   

"The préfet of the town of Kigali" -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is this in the same document?  
MR. CANTIER: 
No, I have now moved to another document, Mr. President.  That document which is the transcript of the radio interview of the 27th of April.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That makes it clearer.  So you are now -- you are now in Defence binder volume 1 number 45, then?  That's where we shall look for the last K reference; is that so?  

MR. CANTIER: 
It is the second (sic) volume, Mr. President, binder -- sorry, tab 15.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are looking.  Why don't you start?  This was K number -- just repeat it.  
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, K0337586.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you got it, Prosecution?  

Okay.  We are there.  
MR. CANTIER: 
I am much obliged, Mr. President. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	So I wish to refer to the fourth paragraph of the said document, which I wish to submit to your attention, Mr. Renzaho.  And I quote:  

"The préfet of the town of Kigali, Colonel Tharcisse Renzaho, continues to ask for the cessation of acts of violence, of lootings and killings, and requests that the persons arrested while committing such acts be severely sanctioned."

Mr. Renzaho, do you recall having made such a statement? 
A.	Yes, I do recognise that that was what was done.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What we heard you say in English, Maître Cantier, was that this was in the second volume, but indeed it is in volume 1 of the Defence binder.  So we have that in front of us now. 

Now, how do we know that this is the 27th of April?  That follows from the beginning of this quote on the top of the page.  So that's where we find it.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Because, Mr. President, in the first sentence, which comes from the journalist, it is the first paragraph.  It says:

"Good morning, it is time for the news in Kinyarwanda.  This is Wednesday the 27th of April."
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  So we agree on that.  We both agree that that sentence is the clue.  What is the next we do now?  That's very good.  

MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I read out the fourth paragraph of the document to Mr. Renzaho.  I read it out to him and he acknowledged that it is indeed what he had stated at the time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have heard that as well.  And what is happening now?  I am just inviting you to proceed, please.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Very well, Mr. President.  Let me proceed with the third document I referred to previously, which is the transcript of a radio programme dated 6th of May of 1994, which can be found in our Defence binder, volume 1, second series of tabs under number 16.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which means 46, because it is the second round.  Yes, we have it, is that K0149350?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, indeed, Mr. President.  This document starts there.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which page, please?  
MR. CANTIER: 
The excerpts I wish to use have the following K numbers:  K0149352, the following page, K0149353, and the next one, K0149354.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	The excerpts are quite lengthy and for that reason -- the excerpts we are interested in are lengthy, so I will choose a few.  The first one being on the page I mentioned, K0149352.  

So, Mr. Renzaho, this is an interview, and I quote:  

"There are people who have selected themselves in order to control the roadblocks.  As a matter of fact, no one can pretend he loves his country more than others, except for traitors.  One can say that a given person is a traitor and does not love his or her country, but there is such a thing as excessive zeal, and it is this excessive zeal that leads to situations where unruly people kill people, and we wish to stand against such actions.  That is the reason for which the conseillers were instructed to monitor -- or, watch those who manhandle people at the roadblocks and who disrupt public order.  They are people who have become untouchables and who disregard observations made by other people.  And they would rather manhandle people as they wish.  This behaviour is unreasonable and is one of the reasons for the insecurity.  I request that the conseillers replace such people immediately, who are at the roadblocks, to put them where they should be.  Some should be put in prison, if necessary, and the others should be brought to justice."

Mr. Renzaho, do you recall having made such a statement? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, I remember.  This is, in fact, expressions of distress. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, do you remember what else you might have said in this document, because this is a very lengthy document?  You just told the Trial Chamber that you were expressing your distress, could you be more explicit as to what you mean by that? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  What I mean is that there was a situation which was not improving while we were expending all our energy trying to solve all the problems.  It is obvious that the anger I had, as expressed in this statement, was due to the very difficult situation we were faced with, and which we were not able to control.  I noted, for example, that the conseiller had not done what he should have.  That was obvious. And it was also obvious that the members of the cellules were not doing what they should, and the grass roots structures, such as the nyumba kumi, when I am being accused of having organised meetings at the préfecture with nyumba kumis, with responsables de cellules, with conseillers; it is clear that such structures had stopped existing, had stopped operating.  
Q.	We shall come to that, Mr. Renzaho.  We shall come to that.  
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you, Mr. Cantier, after the 11 o'clock break, if you do not want to read out all these relevant excerpts from this document, maybe simply draw our attention to them so that we can mark them in this document which you no doubt want to tender as an exhibit later on.  That makes it possible for us to focus on the relevant part, and the Prosecution to know what he is expected to prosecute on.  Could that be done in the little break we have ahead of us?  
MR. CANTIER: 
	Yes, Mr. President.  In fact, I had already marked the excerpts, so it will be quite easy for me to provide the information to you later on.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  We will then resume at 11:25.  
(Court recessed from 1100H to 1125H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are very pleased that the full Bench is together again.  

Maître Cantier?  
MR. CANTIER: 
The Defence is also most gratified, My Lord.  

Now, we had promised, as regards the radio broadcasts, first the one of the 14th of April 1994.  In the French, and perhaps to simplify I will give you the K reference.  It is K -- page 20, K0264706, third paragraph heading, "Speaker, Tharcisse Renzaho, préfet of Kigali", the entire paragraph, which is seven lines long.  

Then K0264707, the next page, the first paragraph, from line 4 to line 8.  And then page 24 in the French, reference K0264710, the whole page.  And the following page, K0264711, second paragraph, and the seven lines from the second paragraph.  

And then we have the second document dated -- which is from the 27th of April 1994, reference K0337586, the fourth paragraph, which I read a bit earlier.  

Finally, the third document, which is a transcript of an interview of the 6th of May 1994, page 3 -- in the French K0149352 -- K0149352, second paragraph, the 13 first lines; 13 -- 13 first lines of the second paragraph.  

And with the same K reference, the sentence beginning "For us to supply Kigali with provisions", and the ends nine lines later, "They will no longer do that work".  

The following page K0149353, in the middle of the page, sentence beginning "He who does not know it must seek an explanation", and ending eights lines lower with the words "a government who want the rule of law". 

And, finally, reference K0149354, the first paragraph, which is seven lines long.  

Those, Mr. President, are the extracts we have selected.  My assistant points out to me that I have forgotten a paragraph.  Please forgive me. 

On the K0149353 already mentioned, we should add the four lines of this page under the given K reference.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That was very helpful.  Thank you very much.  And just for completeness of the record, the three documents now referred to by Maître Cantier, the dates were mentioned by him, but their identification is then P.  51, Defence volume 1, number 45, and Defence volume 1, number 46 respectively.  Thank you.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Very well, Mr. President.  So I shall continue.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I am putting the following question to you:   How did you ensure follow-up by communal authorities of the decisions taken on the 10th of April --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I think it was.  
THE WITNESS:
-- 1994.  After the 8th of April 1994 I held meetings with the bourgmestres, and it was on the occasion of those meetings that I would be informed of what was happening to the extent that the information I was provided with could be relied upon.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Could you give us, Mr. Renzaho, further information on these meetings, their frequency, their duration? 
A.	Well, I don't think those meetings were as frequent as it has been said on some occasions because after the 8th of April 1994 certain measures had to be taken to try to face up to the situation we were in, and sometimes I had to go on the spot.  But we did hold meetings with the bourgmestres.  I can't say how frequently, but I had -- I did have meetings with the bourgmestres. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, when did you learn that initiatives contrary to what you had decided were being taken by communal employees? 
A.	Well, in -- when you're impotent, a situation that you've often denounced doesn't improve, but the factors were numerous, and among the factors was due to a lack of commitment on the ground by basic communal structures in the face of this very difficult situation.  Probably people preferred to hide or to shirk their -- flee from their responsibilities.  I learnt of that progressively after several attempts to get things moving again, to exercise some authority over the activities in the préfecture which were not producing the results I had hoped for.  So it is probable towards the end of the second half of June -- no, I mean April, that I would see that in spite of our efforts to try to master the situation, very little change could be noted.  To a large extent because of the fighting which was gaining in intensity, but also through lack of commitment on the part of those who had to face the danger and go on the spot -- on the ground.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, at the PVK, your personal secretariat, who ran it? 
A.	As soon as we had established the crisis management cell, the secretariat was assigned to that cell -- crisis cell, which was in fact in the secretariat of the Kigali urban préfecture.  The secretaries were with the members of the crisis management cell in the secretariat of the préfecture, and I think that it was Miss Astérie and Mrs. Bisanukuli among members of the crisis management cell, who that later coordinated the small team at the secretariat.  But to all intents and purposes, I had no secretariat other than that secretariat that was assigned to working for the population at that time of crisis.  Thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, you told us at the beginning -- at the outset you spoke of your personal secretary as being, moreover, the first person that you met.  That person, could you remind the Trial Chamber of his name, and did he stay by your side until the end of the events?  
A.	I must tell you that that person did not stay at the préfecture.  He was there for the first week after the triggering events on the 6th of April 1994, and thereafter Alfred Sibomana -- that's his name - left, no doubt under pressure because he wanted to know how his family was.  He left without even saying goodbye to me.  Maybe he was afraid that I would ask him to stay.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, please, on what date did he leave?  
A.	It was a week after the 6th of April, so probably something like the 13th of April 1994.  
Q.	You spoke of Astérie, can you give us her surname, and tell us if she stayed throughout the events by your side? 
A.	Miss Astérie Nikuze stayed during the  events and was assigned to be the secretariat of the crisis management cell.  
MR. CANTIER: 
It's number 370, Mr. President, Astérie.  Sibomana is 532.  And Bisanukuli, who is also mentioned, is number 43, four-three.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, did you learn of the questioning of Miss Astérie Nikuze in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, I have learned of it.  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, I am sure we are getting fairly and squarely, this occasion, in the area of the realm of the Bagosora decision, bearing in mind I have had disclosure of certain documents, including the procès verbal from Rwanda, and it would be my submission that if -- as I am sure my learned friend's intention is to refer to that and have that document presented to Your Honour -- that in terms of the Trial Chamber's decision in respect of procès verbals from Rwanda, it is a matter which falls within 92 bis and this is not the appropriate means of getting to it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The document we are about to approach indirectly now, where do we find it, Defence?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, the document which indeed I am referring to is in our Defence file, volume 1, tab 11.  If I have correctly understood my learned friend from the Prosecution, he does not want the Defence to use this document.  I am prepared to respond to that motion, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But before you do so, it would be good for us to know what we are talking about.  We heard you say volume 1, tab 11.  Is that so?  
MR. CANTIER: 
That is correct, Mr. President.  And there is a second document.  We might as well deal with both matters together, which I wanted to come to and which is in the same volume 1 at tab 10, tab 10.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So this is then a pro justitia with K number 0107785.  That's the document, isn't it?  
MR. CANTIER:
That's correct, Mr. President, and the following document, under reference K0107643 at tab 10 which precede; therefore, the one we have just spoken of.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
These documents refer to different persons, true?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  We are with you.  What are your submissions?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Quite simply, Mr. President, that Rule 92 bis cannot apply to these statements because they do not concern directly the Accused and were not gathered in the course of a procedure concerning him.  So the provisions of 92 bis do not, I feel -- are not I feel applicable and all the more so -- all the more so as they are essential to Mr. Renzaho's defence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But if they don't relate to the defence, why do you want to use them?  If they are not of relevance or do not directly concern the Accused, why do we want to hear of them?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Well, that's a very good question, Mr. President.  It's because the way these matters are handled comes into -- what I am driving at is the behaviour of the communal staff, and that is what concerns us directly because what Mr. Renzaho is accused of is what he did himself, but also by virtue of 6(3), by the people under his orders for whom he is responsible.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So it is relevant to Mr. Renzaho under the perspective of article 6(3)?  Do you have any other submissions?  If not we will ask the Prosecution to address us.  Do you have a copy of Nsengiyumva decision, Mr. Moses?  

It's coming, Mr. Matemanga?  

Which paragraph do you want us to look at?  
MR. MOSES: 
Bearing in mind what my friend has said, it is clear from the statements they are being used to try and impeach Prosecution Witness ALG.  I don't believe they were put to ALG, and the decision that I will hand to Your Honour deals directly with the use of Rwandan pro justitia for the purposes of impeachment of various Prosecution witnesses in that trial, and it was declined -- denied.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Very carefully worded now, ALG, is that the person whose document we have here or is it this person's statement which is here to contradict the testimony of ALG; it's the latter?  

MR. MOSES: 
It's the latter.  One of the persons whose statements they are wanting to use is, in fact, dead, according to the evidence that we have heard.  And I don't think there is necessarily any contradiction to that.  The other person is alive. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I am sorry, Mr. President, could counsel repeat?  That wasn't very clear.  I think he is asking to see the document that he's just referred to. 
MR. CANTIER:
We did not hear the documents at the time of the ALG's cross-examination.  We did not have the document.  But, to respond to my colleague, these documents do not necessarily contradict what ALG said, but speak of ALG's conduct, and that was the topic I was discussing with Mr. Renzaho just now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which paragraph in the decision?  In the entire discussion?  
MR. MOSES: 
Yes, Your Honour, I believe it goes through various Prosecution witnesses and the statements which were being sought to impeach, as it were, those Prosecution witnesses, and the Trial Chamber went through them one by one and denied the Defence to approach the matter in that manner.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What you said, Maître Cantier, would give the impression that the purpose of using this document is not to impeach ALG's testimony.  But if that is your submission, why would you use it?  Couldn't you simply ask the Accused what he knows about ALG, and then we get around it?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, if I have correctly understood the Prosecution's grounds, they want to show that Mr. Renzaho commits the crimes of which he is accused both directly and through the administrative structure under his authority.  Now, the documents we have here concern and that -- it's in that context I raised the topic:  People who were under Renzaho's orders and their conduct.  I would add that I felt it necessary that Mr. -- that the Prosecutor spontaneously and under Rule 68 disclose to us such documents that we discovered thanks to our research after ALG was questioned.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's a bit vague.  If we now look at the pro justitia, K0107785, which lines do you want to use, which portions?  
MR. CANTIER: 
K0107786.  Can I read it?  But then that means I must pronounce its name.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no.  
MR. CANTIER: 
(Microphones overlapping)... person concerned.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Couldn't you simply now say which questions you are referring to?  You see, it starts with a Q and there are quite a few Qs there.  Which question is it?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, on the second page, K0107786, I am counting the questions, and it is question number 5 out of a total of seven questions.  And the following answer, obviously.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Anything to add?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Nothing, Mr. President, except that this document and the following documents are material to Mr. Renzaho on the question I just put to him, that is to say, his authority over the staff in the commune.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But it does affect the role of the person concerned.  It does affect ALG's role during the event and consequently throws light on his credibility.  That is the point, isn't it?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I am not referring to his credibility, I am merely providing an illustration of the question put to Mr. Renzaho, "Did you still have authority over the communal staff?"  And I wish to know whether these people executed his orders and what was their behaviour.   

Mr. President, Your Honours, if I had had this document before ALG testified, I would obviously have made use of it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can't you just ask Mr. Renzaho what his view is in the situation in relation to this individual, and then the testimony of the Accused speaks for himself?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, but with regard to the demonstration I wish to make, it will be substantially weakened because you will hear the utterances of an accused person or -- even though he is a witness, whereas here you have a document which is proof of what Mr. Renzaho said, and proof that it is the truth. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We understand your point of view and the approach you are trying to follow, Maître Cantier, but the fact that you may have discovered this after the appearance of the witness doesn't really change the situation.  The fact that a witness has testified and that a document is being used to contradict his testimony being put to the Accused, letting him comment on that document and thereby getting it into the transcripts and hence part of the case file, is an indirect way of doing it, which is according to our Nsengiyumva decision, not in conformity with the rules.  You will have to content yourself with the question to the Accused, and we will listen carefully both to the question and the answer.  This is settled practice in the Chamber.  
BY MR. CANTIER: 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I asked you previously whether you were aware of the questioning of Miss Astérie and your answer was not (sic) affirmative.  I am now asking you whether you were also aware of the interrogation of Mr. Dieudonné Nkulikiyinka?
A.	Yes, Counsel, I was aware of that.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Number 378 on our list, Mr. President, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maître Cantier, I am not sure you fully used the available opportunity in relation to the previous document.  You can, of course, ask your client what his view is about what is found in that document, and he will then give us his evidence.  Having done so, you can move to the next document, which was the one you now refer to.  Don't you want to use the first opportunity before you go to the second document?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I was proceeding in that way because the two documents are linked.  One witness referring the investigative -- investigation policemen to the other.  

Mr. President, I understand that your ruling has to do with the possibility of having both documents admitted into evidence, but this does not prevent me from putting questions to the Accused on the contents of the said documents.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho -- 
JUDGE ARREY: 
Counsel, you yourself have just said that he said he was not aware that that lady was questioned.  If he wasn't aware that she was ever questioned, you cannot ask him questions to something that he was not aware of.  That's what he said.  You have just said it now, that it was 'not affirmative'.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Your Honour, Mr. President, when I put the question to Mr. Renzaho I believe he answered in the affirmative. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's just clarify this.  

Were you aware of this, Mr. Renzaho?  
(Pages 16 to 31 by Judith Baverstock)

1215H
THE WITNESS:
I answered that I was aware of the document.
MR. CANTIER:
Perhaps a problem in translation?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The problem is that there were two very similar questions.  One relating to the first document and one relating to the second document.  When it comes to the second document, I understand that the person was aware.  When it comes to the first document, as pointed out by Judge Arrey, he says he was not aware of it.  

So there is a distinction in his answers concerning the two documents, according to the English version. 
THE WITNESS:
If I may, Your Honours, I wish to tell you that in both cases my answer was "yes", that I was aware of that fact. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And now looking at the French version, I will read it out: "Mr. Renzaho, sir, earlier on I asked you whether you were aware of the interrogation of Miss Astérie, and you said yes.  So I'm now asking you whether you were aware of the interrogation also of Mr. Nkulikiyinka?  Yes, Counsel, I was aware of that."  

In the French versions there are two answers with yes, and in the English there is one yes and one no and that is behind the confusion, and it's quite understandable that we had problems in clarifying this.  But now we have, in addition to the French version being reread into the transcripts, we also have 
Mr. Renzaho's confirmation again that his answer is "yes" again in relation to both documents.  

So please, proceed.
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	So, Mr. Renzaho, first one question -- as the testimony of Ms. Astérie Nikuze, the following question was put to her in the following document before me:  "Bizimana, Jean Baptiste" -- 
MR. MOSES:
Can I interrupt?  I'm sorry to interrupt.  I am -- I must say somewhat unclear as to the effect of 
Your Honours' ruling because if the document is not admissible then, to be blunt, in our submission it should not be admissible for the Counsel to suddenly read it into the record.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Our problem now is that we need to find out what was the questions imposed by Maitre Cantier.

MR. MOSES:
Well, his last question was he began to read out a question and answer, but I think the LiveNote is not operating just at the moment.  That was the reason for my interruption, because he was about to simply read a question and answer into the record.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you about to read in a document that we just decided you couldn't use?  You wouldn't do that, Maitre Cantier, would you?  
MR. CANTIER:
I believe there's a misunderstanding.  If that was what I'd understood, I would not do it.  But that was not what I understood and it is the reason for which I asked the Trial Chamber about the ruling it had just made.  

So I had understood that you did not want the Defence to have both documents tendered into evidence, but that I could make use of them in order to put my questions to Mr. Renzaho.  So that was how I understood your ruling and that was how I formulated it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That was not the ruling.  You cannot, once a document has not been allowed as a possible exhibit, read it in connection with the question and answer.  What we meant -- and that is certainly in conformity with practice, is that you can solicit independently of this document similar evidence from the Accused, but not going all the way through the document.  That is the effect of the ruling.
MR. CANTIER:
Very well, Mr. President, so I may use the answers provided, the questions and the answers without reading them out.  Very well.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's very simple.  You can ask, for instance, ask Mr. Renzaho whether he knows anything about 
Witness ALG based on his own knowledge, but forget about this witness statement.  That's the situation.
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, it is quite difficult for counsel to forget about elements that is material to his client's defence.
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	So, Mr. Renzaho, when reading the first document, how did you come to learn of the behaviour of ALG?  
MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, I had understood it was to be independent of the reading of the document.  So my understanding that the sort of question that Your Honour was anticipating was:  Were you aware of the activities of ALG?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Renzaho, we are not interested in documents by persons not appearing as witnesses before this Trial Chamber.  Now that follows from the rules adopted within the Rules of Procedure and Evidence in this Tribunal.  It may be different in the national jurisdiction of many countries, including my own, 
Maitre Cantier.  That is the situation here.  

For that reason we are not interested in what you know having probably read in this document by Astérie Nikuze.  Do you know anything you want to convey to us about the role of Witness ALG during the event which could be relevant to your defence?  That's the issue.  Have you understood the question?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I did understand your question.  I understood your question.  Are you asking me to answer your question?  
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. Renzaho, you do have to answer something.  We had pains to come up with the question, please do not disappoint us. 
THE WITNESS: 
	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Hold on.  You cannot refer to names in this connection and we have to place that under seal.  And, Maitre Cantier, when we have adopted an approach which I am sure everyone in the courtroom fully has adopted, it would be useful if you assist Mr. Renzaho to get from him what you think is relevant for you; can you help us, please?  
THE WITNESS:
Of course. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
To avoid any lack of clarity, the reference to the name and the position will be placed under separate cover.  And video booth, please do not transmit that.  

Here follows the question. 
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, we had come up with a different system with the Prosecutor yesterday.  That is to say only to give the pseudonym of the witness in order to avoid such difficulties, and you had proposed when the name of a protected witness was to be mentioned here, that it be written on a piece of paper. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Everyone in this courtroom knows who we are talking about.  That follows from the entire record.  We do not need a piece of paper in this situation.  It can be used in some situations where the actors in the courtroom hear of this for the first time, but here we have another reference point, namely the pseudonym.  So you can just proceed in connection with ALG.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	So, Mr. Renzaho, regarding that person, please do not mention his name or his position, but please refer to ALG.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.
Q.	So, Mr. Renzaho, now for the specific question:  Did Mr. ALG take any initiative during the events which was contrary to the instructions or the orders you had given him?  And if your answer is in the affirmative, could you provide an example?
A.	Counsel, in order to be consistent with what I just said, would you allow me to finish with what I had started saying?
Q.	Yes, please go ahead, Mr Renzaho, conclude what you were saying and conclude with the question that was put to you.
A.	I believe that in my capacity as préfet I had some authority over the bourgmestre or the communal authorities, in the spirit of what you just stated, in times of peace as in times of war, and that was what happened.  

Now, as regards initiatives, we should place ourselves in the context of April to July of 1994.  Events took place in this small area of the commune led by ALG, (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover).  And this right of oversight was not made easy in view of the fighting that was taking place and because there was no time to make written reports, or even for that matter oral reports.  So it would have been difficult for me to exercise this right of oversight in light of the prevailing situation.  

Now with regard to initiatives on the part of that person, I can tell you it was not easy to take good initiatives during a period such as that one because it would require courage.  There were none.  It required audacity and he did not have such audacity.  It required some amount of loyalty vis-a-vis one's superiors in one's endeavours, and that was not the case.  If you asked me for my opinion, this is what I can tell you regarding that individual.  

It was difficult for me to bear seeing him here, but I am giving you my opinion, my assessment, and I will seize this opportunity to provide examples of what I am saying because throughout my life, I have hardly ever said anything evil about anybody.
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, that is exactly what I was expecting from you, an example.  This is why I put questions to you without being able to cite that document directly.
A.	Let me give you one example, which unfortunately is contained in my indictment, or in the charges brought against me.  It is the incident that took place on the 22nd of April of 1994 at CELA.  This was an incident which was recounted in different ways by many witnesses who came here to testify, which did not occur in the way in which it was depicted.  

I will spare you the narration of the whole story, but with regard to the people we are referring to let me state that the information on the events that were going to take place in CELA reached the secretariat of the secteur.  The information was received and conveyed to the crisis unit, which informed me shortly after that.  What was involved?  Gendarmes who were there were faced with a difficult situation, a group of attackers, some 40 attackers had just entered the CELA compound and were threatening refugees who were there.  

The gendarmes who were on the site while trying to prevent acts of violence from being perpetrated appealed to their superiors in order to get reinforcement.  Since they received no positive response, the leader of the detachment that was at CELA went -- or asked the préfecture for assistance.  And this is how the information reached the secretariat of the préfecture. 

I thereupon gave the order, or instruction, to go on the spot and settle the incident.  He was supposed to have the gendarmerie support.  Anyhow I thought it would have been possible to do it, and after giving him the instruction I went back to my office.  It wasn't far away.  It was next door.  Instead of doing what I told him, he went off to hide in the building's basement and stayed there until the gendarme, having waited in vain for the reinforcements they called for, telephoned again, called again to say that the danger was imminent.  So they came to fetch me and told me that the situation is even worse.  

So, you must understand that I couldn't understand.  I was astounded, so I asked if the bourgmestre had gone to do what I asked him to do; to fulfil the task I'd assigned to him and they told me:  No, he's in the cellar, in the basement.  And we don't know if he is prepared to fulfil that mission.  

So I summonsed him and I saw him in a very sorry psychological state.  I have never seen men crying when asked to undertake a task, a mission, whatever its nature be.  So then I reacted perhaps a bit.  That's when I said that man was a pathetic figure and simply wasn't up to the task.  And I immediately decided to go and fulfil the mission, and that's what I am accused of now.  He didn't have the courage to come and tell you what really happened.  Because when he saw me leave he joined the group that followed me.  He did come and he did see what was happening on the spot.  But he didn't have the courage to say it here.  Thank you.
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, do you have another example to briefly tell the Trial Chamber that you might briefly narrate?  Do you?  
A.	Counsel, these are difficult situations.  Some people might think that I'm here to seek revenge, vengeance.  But that's not in my nature.  There are problems, I assure you.  As regards that individual, I tried to put myself in the position of a subordinate faced with a superior.  They might see our behaviour, and we don't know about it, but they are observing us.  But in the heat of the action in April 1994, it was constant, every minute, one had to act.  

Let me tell you here, the events that occurred in Nyarugenge commune and the communal authority, the normal authority, would be the normal place to go with such problems, to solve them.  But when I was absent -- for things to be coherent, when I was absent the authority that would replace me would be Nyarugenge commune.  I was always told that you must always take an initiative if you're in a managerial position.  

And when I left to see my family in Kanombe it was during my absence that some critical things that could be criticised were done.  Firstly, there were refugees who had stayed with us without any problem in those days, and I sought information as to the situation, the circumstances under which those refugees were chased away, but forcefully removed to another place without awaiting any decision from me.  Because when I came back, I found that it was already done and dusted, and some of the refugees who stayed came to complain to me -- complained to me.  

But it was already done.  Of course, I scolded the bourgmestre.  I criticised him, but nothing could then be done.  I was lucky no one had then been killed.  And immediately afterwards the event of 14th June occurred of which I am accused.  That incident was first and foremost the responsibility of the bourgmestre.  And, funnily enough, it was during my absence.  I don't wish to go -- dwell at length on the whys and wherefores of that incident, but I would like to say the versions you have heard here do not match what we know of the incident.
Q.	You mentioned the date the 14th of June, could you tell us where, for the Trial Chamber to fully understand what you are referring to? 
A.	The incident I am referring to is what occurred at Saint Paul where 50 men were taken away and handed over to a band of killers who are unnamed, even the leader is unknown.  That is the incident I'm referring to. 
Q.	Yes, Mr. Renzaho.  The question that I think occurs to all of us here is when you heard of such events, what was your reaction?  Did you take steps, corrective steps, in respect of those people? 
A.	Well, that's -- that was the problem I faced, what gave me a lot of trouble.  Number 1, the people were appointed by presidential decree under a law over which I have no authority.  The procedures are very lengthy and I was in a weakened position because I had no one to -- that I could substitute.  I might suspend that person and appoint a civil servant who would manage the situation in my name.  But I was already short of staff; as I've said, they were already committed on the field.  

Then there's the direct consequences of the difficult situation we were living in -- we were going through at the time.  What could be the reaction of the citizenry if I suspended the bourgmestre with the difficulty there was, difficulty in any way of the procedures to go about sacking him?  The proper procedures in those days were very difficult.  As to any other measures to be taken, well, it was very difficult under the circumstances. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, do you know what became of Astérie Nikuze, your secretary? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  From what I have heard from various sources that person is deceased, no longer alive. 
Q.	Do you know the circumstances of her demise? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel, I have had reliable information that she -- that person was questioned on several occasions by Rwandan security services, intelligence, security service.  And the last time she presented herself she died. 
Q.	What was her ethnicity? 
A.	She was Tutsi. 
Q.	Do you know what happened to Dieudonné Nkurikiyinka?  Number 378 on the list.  
A.	I know that person is still working in Kigali at the préfecture, except it is not called the préfecture anymore.  It's called the mayor's office.  So he continued working as an accountant for Kigali mayor's office. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, for what reason did certain conseillers leave their jobs? 
A.	Counsel, I think that the situation was such that the reasons were many.  My first checking up, I noted that several conseillers were killed in the night of the 6th to the 7th.  Others were reportedly absent, for example, conseiller for Kicukiro and that of Kimihurura and others, I had to replace; well, I appointed, replacements.  

The first one was that of Nyamirambo who was replaced by the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge.  And I approved because the person had just spent more than two weeks without being seen and we welcomed, we received at the préfecture a group of people that came to complain that there was no local authority when the secteur was facing a war situation, because this was towards the end of the month of April.  

As for the other conseiller, Nyakabanda, he fled at the beginning, at the outset.  And procedures would have been followed for his replacement by naming from the list of candidates to the municipal elections who came next would be appointed.  So it's a bourgmestre who appointed the replacements of the conseillers and all I had to do was to accept.  
And the last that I mentioned was a case that I had also seen in my indictment, which indeed hurt me considerably.  I'm referring to the case of the Cyangugu conseiller.  It was said that he had been sacked by me, chased away by me, who might -- and that I wanted to replace him with an extremist candidate to kill the Tutsi.  

I should like to make it clear that I received that person on the 7th in the evening, and he spoke to me of the situation prevailing in his secteur which was occupied, firstly, by the Alpha brigade in the night from the 6th to the 7th.  I had left that position and arrived in his secteur in Gisozi and he could not stay there anymore because he had been warned by a friend.  He left.  We received him.  We kept him at the préfecture and towards the end of the month of April he freely asked to be able to go to the 
Hôtel des Mille Collines where the former conseiller had taken advantage of -- to be able to go behind the ranks of the RPF.  

I tried to call him here.  I tried to call him here to testify, but you know what the difficulties have been.  He is working at Texwa (phonetic).  I have reliable information on that.  There had been an exchange of  prisoners that have been allowed to leave Mille Collines. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, are you referring to any particular text when you speak of the replacements of conseillers? 
A.	Yes, certainly, I'm referring to the law of the 23rd November 1963, which had been regularly -- frequently amended, but that was the law governing local government. 
Q.	And in that law, you're referring to a specific article? 
MR. CANTIER:
Your Honours, the document is Exhibit P. 9. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I'd asked you, are you referring to a specific article? 
A.	I'm sorry, Counsel, I don't remember the specific article. 
Q.	The Trial Chamber will understand.  Well, Mr. Renzaho, let us change topics.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
To make sure that the Trial Chamber understands, do you want to give us the reference so it is relevant, so we have it on record?  Even if Mr. Renzaho does not remember right away. 
MR. CANTIER:
Article 10 bis of the law, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, would this be a good moment to stop now, before you move on to the next segment?  
MR. CANTIER:
But, of course, Mr. President. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, when we resume at 3:00, then we will first hear this motion concerning an additional witness.  We have a few questions that we may wish to ask you, and then we will continue with the testimony of Mr. Renzaho.  I am just making sure that you have all the documents with you when we start with that at 3 o'clock.  The Court is adjourned.  
(Court recessed from 1257H to 1501H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon.  

As indicated before the break we would like to have some comments from the parties in connection with the pending motion from the Defence to add one witness to their witness list. 

And we will start with the Prosecution.  Mr. Moses, you indicated in your response that it was difficult to start investigating because you lacked the necessary information concerning the witness's wife, in particular.  Some days ago the Chamber invited the Defence to provide the missing information.  They didn't have it immediately at hand, but provided it as soon as possible thereafter.  

Now, leaving aside whether the formal requirements have been abided by the Defence, what is your situation now?  How complicated is it?  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, I received that information last Thursday and immediately sent it to our investigations section in Kigali, and simply said:  Can you commence investigations?  I've heard nothing back from them at this stage.  

There are two aspects, I think I indicated to the investigation for this potential witness, the first is any such investigations which may be able to be carried out in Rwanda.  And the second is by virtue of the witness's particular situation having left Rwanda and gone to another country.  There are other investigations which can be carried out.  

Your Honours will, I think, understand that the investigations department can't launch those type of investigations, which are necessarily costly potentially, if it requires visiting, as it often does, the people concerned and to carry out such checks with any organisations within the country that that person is in.  That can't be launched until -- we can't even apply really for them to have funds used in that way until a decision is made as to whether or not the witness is to testify.  It would be impossible to justify on the basis that it was a potential person.  
So those are the -- so far as the first issue is concerned, I don't know how they were getting on.  I haven't made any enquiries since sending the information last Thursday.  So far as the second part is concerned, none has begun. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You received the information you needed on which date?  Can you recall that?  You said last Thursday, was that so?  
MR. MOSES: 
Yes, Your Honours.  Your Honour indicated, I think, on Wednesday when we commenced that the information we had required should be given to us as soon as possible and it was the following day.  I believe that's the 23rd of August. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And how much do you think you would need in order to do what you have to do in case you had the possibility?  
MR. MOSES: 
I would want Your Honour, I am sorry, to check out with the investigators before committing them, or myself, to a position.  And I could make some enquiries -- or have some enquiries made this afternoon, I guess, to see how they are getting on. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence, you understand that the Prosecution is in a very difficult position, and we must follow some rules here and if they are not given sufficient time then the situation is complicated.  This session is supposed to end next Friday.  That is when you're leaving, is that so?  You won't be in Arusha after Friday, or will you?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, the Defence has taken all these factors into consideration.  And in our motion we stated that we, of the Defence, discovered the witness only on 25 July, and within the Defence we don't have anymore information than the Prosecution, and all the other information that we subsequently collected, we have disclosed such information to the Prosecution in good time, so as to be in keeping with the date for the end of this session and the time limit for 21 days for the Prosecution to carry out its investigation.  

So our motion of 14 August is the same date on which we disclosed the witness statement to the Prosecution.  In the same motion, we proposed that the witness be heard on 6th September, that would give the Prosecution enough time to carry out its investigation. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You see, Mr. Nekuie, we know all that.  This is not the point.  The point is that the information provided was not sufficient.  That's why the investigations couldn't start on the day you had envisaged.  No one is blaming the Defence.  You did your very best.  You gave what you had.  You gave what was available to you.  

The question now is simply whether we can find a practical solution and whether we cannot.  That is why I will repeat my question:  Is that Friday the last day you are available to hear testimony?  We will ask the Prosecution the same question afterwards.
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Mr. President, sir, we are at the disposal of the Chamber.  In principle, we planned to be there on Friday to hear the witness's testimony, but the Chamber in all sovereignty may prescribe a date on which we would be here and we would conform to the decision of the Chamber.  So we are available as far as the Defence is concerned. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Moses, if the solution were to be that we -- that we heard the witness in-chief and gave you sufficient time to prepare for cross, once the investigations were carried out, would you be available for, say, half a day at some stage later? 
MR. MOSES: 
Yes, Your Honour, but not the following week, which is -- I think I had indicated that particular week, I am the team at the moment and that was going to be a problem for me.  

Now, yes, any time subsequent to that, of course I'm anxious -- I think everyone's anxious to try and finish the evidence as soon as possible.  Perhaps Your Honour can -- if Your Honours can wait until the end of the day, I've had our case manager go now to telephone Kigali to see how they're getting on.  And if they are able to give me, and I in turn give you, any indication, once I know that and if I also find out that they have sufficient material that I feel I can carry out my duties and responsibilities properly then -- I'm not wanting to delay this trial for a minute for the sake of it.  

And if I can advise the Trial Chamber that that material is available by the middle of next week, I would happily conduct the cross-examination in the middle of next week.  My concern is not to be committed to a position which I am embarrassed about because I have not been given sufficient information or time. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This exchange does not in any way imply any suggestion as to how the Chamber would rule, it simply means that we want to explore the situation.  And we will come back to you later today, once you have got some provisional news from Kigali.  Thank you for this useful information.  

Mr. Renzaho, your examination-in-chief continues. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, first, do you know a policeman called Hakorimana? 
A.	If I have to tell the truth, I don't know his name.  I did not know the names of all the policemen that we had at the préfecture.  There was a service that managed them and the name does not ring a bell with me. 
MR. CANTIER: 
It is number 157 on the list. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Do you know what fate befell that policeman before that event? 
A.	I don't know.  At any rate, I don't recall any measure that I may have taken to dismiss that policeman. 
Q.	Do you know a responsable de cellule called Kanimba? 
A.	I did not know him. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Your Honours, 215 on the list. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, could you give us the highlights of your agenda on 9 April 1994? 
A.	Briefly, on 9 April 1994 I basically was involved in the implementation of certain aspects that we had agreed upon at the meeting of 8 April.  That is, setting up the crisis committee, the various commissions, and looking for the personnel who would help us around those commissions, notably the infrastructure commission whose officials could not be found at the préfecture.  

	So, we had to go and look for personnel of Electrogaz, a state-owned company, a state-owned utility in charge of water and electricity.  I negotiated with the officials to obtain the release of a number of technicians to come to the préfecture to treat the water, water to be treated on a daily basis.  

And I was very fortunate to have the assistance of CICR, the International Red Cross.  That gave us equipment to treat water and had to ensure that the other commissions that were provided for were up and running, and the priority ones were the commission in charge of providing documents, notably the laissez-passers, because there was a huge crowd of people who wanted to leave town on account of the fighting.  So that is what I did.  

And about 11 a.m. I went to see many refugees and displaced persons who were at the embassy of the Zaire.  There were foreigners and friends who had to be taken care of.  There were very many of them.  And I had tried to see how we could take them in because the embassy could not take care of all of them.  It was the rainy season.  Then they had been identified, so they could be given food and water while waiting to have the means to repatriate them.

1515H 
THE WITNESS (continued):
	That was an extremely arduous task, but we succeeded.  On 9 April in the afternoon, my family came to join me in Kigali.  I sent them to Hotel Kiyovu, a small -- rather, average hotel.  And then I had to look after problems of accommodation and housekeeping.  So it was -- it was a bit exposed, so I had to ask for some protection.  

So that is about all I did on the 9 of April.  Thank you.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Well, Mr. Renzaho, looking again at the timetable on that crucial day, can you tell the Chamber what you did on 10 April, essentially? 
A.	Thank you very much.  On 10 April, in the morning, I received a message that there was a meeting of the International Committee of the Red Cross at the Hôtel des Diplomates at about 11 a.m.  Then I continued to work in my office.  And in the interval, I received a message from some policemen who were assigned to the downtown area, notably, the Kigali market, that a crowd had attacked the stores, the shops, there.  They attacked the shops, pulled off the tiles, carried away what they could, and the situation was getting out of hand.  So I telephoned to the army chief of staff because I was told that there were guns of soldiers and gendarmes within the crowd, and so I thought that speech alone would not be enough, and I thought maybe there should be some force to compel them, all the more so as the majority of them came from Nyacyonga, that had experienced a lot of fighting, and that had been attacked by the RPF troops on their push towards Kigali.  

So the army came, fired in the air; they were using armoured vehicles, and then soldiers that came in were calming the shopping area.  And calm was restored in the area.  And in some other areas that we also mentioned, especially Gikondo.  

So at the time indicated, I went to attend a meeting, which was like a discovery to me, because I knew that in Kigali there was the International Committee of the Red Cross, but I'd never spoken to them in respect to services.  And the representative of the ICRC, Mr. Gaillard, briefed us very rapidly on the humanitarian situation in Kigali.  It was a situation that I knew.  But what I didn't know was that we were threatened with a major epidemic if nothing was done immediately to rescue the situation.  He also mentioned contacts that he had undertaken with the president of the republic -- of the prime minister who had promised the full support of the government.  And that is how I also met persons in charge of security.  I met army officers, gendarmerie officers.  And I myself -- we actually agreed on the principle, and we expressed our entire collaboration.  

The meeting ended, and I was summoned by the minister of health.  Actually, the government was housed at the Hôtel des Diplomates.  That was at about 1 p.m.  And the minister for health was there with his counterpart, the minister of public works, and they briefed me on the practical procedures for the holding of a coordination meeting of the services that had to be assigned to the ICRC to help it discharge its duties.  

I told them that at the Kigali city préfecture we had the conference hall, and that it was already playing host to a number of refugees but we could make an effort, during the meeting, to move those people out just so the meeting could take place, and the refugees could get back into the hall after the meeting.  We all agreed on the principle of it.  Thereafter, they drafted a communiqué listing the persons they needed for the operation.  They convened them to a the meeting at the Kigali préfecture on the 11th at 9 a.m.  Ended the meeting, and I went back to the Kigali préfecture. 

I don't know whether the other activities I had on that day are of interest to the Chamber, but basically, that's it.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I believe that on that day you drafted a communiqué we mentioned, didn't you? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, that is correct. 
Q.	I would like to shape that question, because we saw that document in the PVK dated 14 April.  

Well, Mr. Renzaho, since you have started, let's move to the day of 11 April 1994.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just to be certain here, we have one statement of 10th April, P. 49, and one statement of 14th April, P. 51.  And which one is it that you drafted on the 10th of April?  
THE WITNESS:
That was the communiqué that gave instructions for roadblocks to be dismantled.  That is, the communiqué of the 10th of April.  Basically, the communiqué -- in the communiqué, I asked the population to dismantle the day's roadblocks, as a main point. 
MR. CANTIER: 
It is Exhibit P. 49, Mr. President.  I'm sorry.
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	All right, then, Mr. Renzaho, we'll move on to the day of 11 April.  And since you started talking about it, could you just continue, please?  
A.	Thank you.  I started the day of 11 April 1994 with a meeting.  It was precisely the meeting that brought together the minister of health, the minister of public works, the representative of the ICRC and his team, and myself, with the public sanitation team.  And the ministers had also convened their personnel, those that were required.  And the meeting took place in the conference hall of the Kigali city préfecture, from 9 a.m.  

The meeting did not last for long.  Actually, they sought to implement what we had discussed the previous evening with the representative of the ICRC.  And so at the meeting, gave the floor to Mr. Gaillard who presented his working mission, we supported, and there were practical questions that we raised and addressed; notably, who was supposed to do what?  Who was supposed to provide fuel?  Vehicles had been presented to the préfecture, admittedly, as well as drivers, but who was going to provide fuel?  And so the ICRC representative tackled that issue and decided to provide fuel, and he stated the ethics of the ICRC in such activities.  

For instance, he asked me personally to ensure that the policemen who were going to escort the convoy should not be armed, and I did just that.  I explained to those people that that was how it was supposed to work.  And all the vehicles had to fly the flag of the ICRC.  So it was a coordination meeting to seek to implement of the activities of the ICRC. 
Q.	Yes, Mr. Renzaho, precisely.  The objective of that meeting, witnesses have come here in this Chamber to talk about it.  So could you clarify us on the decisions that were taken at that meeting in the presence and with the collaboration of the ICRC?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  The decisions were that at the end of the meeting the services present were going to be assigned to the ICRC to help it carry out its work; because, of course, there were some specialised personnel who were working, but the resources and the label had to be provided by the government.  There was the public sanitation, service of the ministry of public health that was available.  There was also the public sanitation service of the préfecture that were assigned to the ICRC.  

And what was it all about, since we're talking about humanitarian actions, and it may not be very clear.  It means that after a week of fighting and killing, there were corpses laid out all over that had to be removed and buried somewhere.  But that was not all.  Because the persons who were carrying out all the terrible acts also injured a number of persons, and these injured persons were the priority because they were persons who could still be saved.  So the work included evacuation of injured persons, who had to be identified in various houses in the neighbourhoods, because they were not on the public highway, as I often hear here, or at the roadblocks.  So, they had to do with moving in the houses, in the neighbourhoods.  And then people would tell you there was a problem in this or that house, and so on.  So, it was not only on the highways or at the roadblocks.  So we had to carry out that work of research, identification and assembly so the ICRC could do its work.  

Then, again, we noticed that we had a number of refugees, lots of refugees.  The refugees went to locations where they hoped they would be protected, and they had done so since the 7th on the large scale, and in Kigali we had a number of sites which were sheltering refugees.  And those refugees were hungry, they were sick, and the humanitarian services had to start taking care of them.  So those were the matters that were to be dealt with during that meeting of the 11th at 9 a.m. at the préfecture of the town in Kigali. 

At 10:30 I left in order to attend the meeting of the préfets, which was to be chaired by the minister of the interior, but at the time he had not yet returned from the mission he had undertaken with the president of the republic, when he died in the attack.  So the meeting was chaired by the prime minister, and it ended around 1 p.m. 

And in the evening, I believe I made contact with a number of managers of hotels in order to see to what extent assistance could be provided to them in order for them to feed the people who were there.  And perhaps I'm talking about the Kiyovu Hotel, the Mille Collines hotel, the Hôtel des Diplomates, because they had a number of people there, and the food supplies were scarce in Kigali.  In fact, there was a shortage of food.  And it was necessary to find an escort for them in order to help them go to the markets for supplies in Gitarama, for example, which was close to Kigali, and where they could purchase food for the people who were staying in the hotel.  

So that is what I did on the 11th.  
Q.	Yes.  Thank you, Mr. Renzaho.  Could we pause for a while on the meeting of the préfets you referred to a moment ago, and which took place at the Hôtel des Diplomate?  

In your capacity as préfet of the town, did you receive any specific instructions from the prime minister, since you stated that he was the one who chaired that meeting?  
A.	First of all, Counsel, let me tell you that because of the first meeting I arrived late, and I apologised for that.  But I did not receive any specific instruction, even if some overzealous people have stated a number of things I allegedly stated upon my arrival at that meeting that was chaired by the prime minister.  When I'm referring to overzealous people, I wish to refer to a specific witness I will not mention, and whose pseudonym I don't recall, who came and testified in a trial that when I arrived at that meeting I'd started talking about a theory for the organisation of killings.  Such people are observing rules we are not aware of.  We have lived through a traumatic situation, and no one should invent anything that did not occur.  We were placed in a very difficult situation.  I have not received any specific instruction. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, apart from the radio, did you have any other means to directly address the population?  I'm thinking more specifically of the television, for example.  Did you go on television?  
A.	In April of 1994, the Rwandan television was not operational.  The offices of the national television were next to the offices of the préfecture, the buildings were next to one another.  But the national television did not operate, so there was only one way, which was to have messages broadcast over the radio.  
Q.	Yes, Mr. Renzaho, this morning we looked at a number of messages you had broadcast.  What was your objective when you were having such messages broadcast on the radio?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  My objective had everything to do with the situation we were faced with.  These were difficult times, and people were to try to think instead of unleashing passions, so the messages I sent were messages for pacification.  I asked the inhabitants to adopt responsible attitudes in the face of such a situation.  That is what I can say.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I now wish to submit to your attention a number of excerpts taken from your interventions that were used by the Prosecution and notably by Witness Alison Des Forges, the historian, and I will ask that you explain to the Trial Chamber what you had stated at the time.  I wish now to refer to such statements in a chron -- in the chronological order.
MR. CANTIER:
And I will, of course, provide to the Trial Chamber, as well as to the Prosecution, the documents I will be using.  The first document is P. 50, which is only available in English, on page 9.  
 
And perhaps the representative of the registry could provide to Mr. Renzaho copies of the documents I will ask him to comment upon in a moment.  So the first document is Exhibit P. 50, page 9. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I wish for this document to be placed before you, and I shall proceed in the same manner for the following documents, because it might not be sufficient to rely on your memory.  

Mr. Renzaho, the said document is in English, but we already submitted it to your attention, and I believe you will be able to decipher it.  It is not a paragraph, since there are no paragraphs in this text, but I wish to refer to the first 12 lines of the text.  

Could you read them all over again?  And once you have done that, I will put one question to you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you do not have to read them out, Mr. Renzaho, just make sure that you have looked at them.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I believe it would not be necessary for me to read it out myself, or would it be necessary for the purposes of -- 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Well, Mr. Renzaho, so let us go straight to the subject.  I believe you recall the comment that was made on this excerpt.  Are you in a position to explain to the Trial Chamber the objective you were aiming at through this message, and what comments you can make on it today?  
A.	The problem is that I cannot read English at a very fast pace, so -- 
MR. CANTIER: 
So perhaps we could ask the interpretation booth to translate it into French?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  Do you have it available, booth?  
MR. MOSES: 
I know it was subsequently provided in Kinyarwandan, which might be easier for the witness to read. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is that available, Mrs. Ben Salimo, the Kinyarwandan version of P. 50?  Do you have that in the plastic folder?  
MS. BEN SALIMO:  
(No interpretation) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I'm asking you now whether it is there, the Kinyarwandan version?  Can we have a look?  

It's not here.  All right.  Has the booth got these lines?  This is from the prefect of Kigali, and then 12 lines.  That's what you want read out, is that so?  You wanted to start from the very beginning?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, I just provided my own copy for the Trial Chamber.  I had underscored it in my copy, but I believe it is indeed the one you mentioned.  It begins at the beginning of the page. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
If the English booth could read, and then we get the translation into French, please.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, I believe it would be easier for someone to read it out from the courtroom, and it would then be interpreted into French. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  

"The prefect of Kigali préfecture urges, once again, all the population to keep on watching out by patrolling through all the ways, even all places where the enemy may establish his freehold.  The prefect urges the population from the communes neighbouring the chief town, that is, Butamwa, Kanombe, Rugenge, Rutongo, and Shyorongo, to do more in maintaining security by collaborating with the armed forces in driving the enemy out.  They are requested, once again, not to desert their houses because this would mean providing the enemy with a bridge.  They are requested to follow the instructions which were repeatedly issued by the ministry of defence and the ministry of interior and communal development.  This is, then, an announcement."  

Is this what you want read out, Maître Cantier?  
MR. CANTIER: 
No, Mr. President.  I believe we're not on the right document, and my learned colleague from the Prosecution also agrees.  We agree, at least, on that.  

The representative of the registry, could I please get my document back, the one I had underscored?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It was very kind of you not to interrupt me, but you should have done it a bit earlier, I think.  Now, I'm doing my very best here, because that's the document I was given.  And that's why I started asking you, Maître Cantier, whether the first words were, "The prefect of Kigali," and I was told yes.  

Now, let's sort this out.  Mr. Moses, do you have a concrete proposal?  
MR. MOSES: 
I believe I have the K number at the top of the document which might assist Your Honour.  It is, as my friend pointed out, I believe, is page 9 of P. 50.  And the K number is hard to read but it looks as though it is K0216044.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But what are the first words to start with?  Is it -- 
MR. MOSES:
(Microphones overlapping)
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- "It is all right," or is it further down?  
MR. MOSES: 
You'll have to ask my learned friend, but that is the right page, at least. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, sir.  If we are on the right page, it is at the beginning of the page, and it starts with, "We request of them to make patrols."  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Shall I make a new attempt, then, just to save time.  

"We request of them to make patrols within their quarters, like usual.  They ought to come together and look for their traditional tools they are used to, and defend themselves.  I would like to request of them that now each quarter should try to organise itself and make a communal work within quarters by cutting off bushes, searching empty houses, check out in the nearby swamp if no Inyenzi hid inside.  They ought to do all this so that they get the hope that nobody hid inside.  They must cut those bushes, check in gutters in houses overgrown with weeds.  Then at night, they have to be watchful so that they find nobody inside houses and kill him, or something else.  People must come together within quarters.  On the streets leading to their quarters, it would be a good thing to block them with roadblocks.  They can look after them, choose people they really trust, and who have papers, and put them there."  

Is that the essential segment, Maître Cantier?  Can we stop there?  

MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President.  This was indeed the main part of this excerpt that I wished to submit to Mr. Renzaho's attention for his comments, since it was an excerpt which was used by the Prosecution and by Witness Alison Des Forges. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho --
A.	Well, Counsel, it would be very helpful if you could tell me the approximate date of the message. 
Q.	This document is an interview dated 12th of April of 1994.  
A.	Without being able to guarantee that all that is said therein is indeed what I uttered, because I found a number of transcripts which were somewhat changed, or altered.  But let me submit the problem to you as it appears.  Generally, the messages were linked to specific situation occurring in Kigali, and for which messages were made for the population to adopt specific attitudes.  

On the 12th, the whole city of Kigali had been circled -- surrounded, and the higher parts of Kigali were occupied by RPF troops.  The positions of UNAMIR were now under the hands of the RPF, and it was the date on which the government left Kigali.  And to show how relevant the message was, during the night of the 11th, we had observed the advance of the RPF forces in the Nyarugenge secteur, Rugunga cellule, where a number of people were killed, and my family and myself came under attack during that same night.  I was fortunate enough to have 11 soldiers at my disposal so they were able to chase the attackers.  During that same night, there was a foray in the Mulindi cellule in the Nyamirambo secteur.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Renzaho?  You have been given a text, it appears to be your words, it gives an impression that you're asking people to search for them -- search for people hiding.  And the innuendo is that it's an order to kill them.  That's behind this.  That's what's being put to you.  

Now, was that what you said?  It's not explicitly stated.  How do you explain this statement?  That is what Maître Cantier wants you to comment upon, so don't take this long round around.  Tell us, why did you choose those word on the 12th of April where people were being killed in thousands?  That's the question.  
THE WITNESS:
First of all, it should be clear that I did not order -- give orders to anyone to kill anybody.  I did not give any such order to have anyone killed.  The message is referring to the context in which we were, which I had explained.  There were forays within our -- the FAR territory.  Because the Rugunga cellule is also in the area that was under government control.  And I mentioned another case in the Kimisaga (sic) secteur, which was also within the government patrolled area.  So the objective of the patrols was to make sure that people coming from outside not be able to enter the government-controlled area, which they had already done.  So I was referring to specific cases.  

And to give you, also, some idea on the prevailing situation at the time, in the case of Kimisagara, for example, the RPF troops had already conquered the positions where the Petrorwanda people were, and reached the red light in Nyarugenge.  So they ended up face-to-face with attackers.  And what I'm telling you is true.  

So the patrols were recommended, as well as searches in the neighbourhood.  That was -- those were the recommendations that were made, and there was no specific order given to kill people.  I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's fair enough.  Now, the word here is not "RPF", it's "Inyenzi".  Any comment on that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have a comment.  Inyenzi is -- does not have a pejorative meaning.  I listened to the national radio in 2003, and one of the former leaders of those who organised forays in Rwanda during the '60s, and who had already been freed -- or released before the RPF attack, I listened to him in 2003, and he was boasting about the boldness and bravery.  This is a historical fact.  I do not know whether that word was used in the pejorative sense.  Not at all.  It is as if one was to refer to the national guard, which was -- which led to the present Rwandan army.  So it was a movement that was formed during the war in order to take into account the historical claim of the descendants of former Rwandan refugees who were outside.  And they linked both words, Inyenzi-Inkotanyi.  So this was an expression that was used, and I don't believe it was used in a derogatory manner.  Inyenzi has a meaning, which refers to the former Rwandan armies.  There was a royal militia, which was of high repute, and it was from then on that the word was coined.  It comes from there.  "Inyenzi".  And it is not derogatory in any way.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I will read out a second document to you, a document that was submitted by the Prosecution.  Exhibit 51.  P. 51.  And this one is in French, and it was used by the Prosecution.  And it's Witness Alison Des Forges to highlight the collaboration between the administration and political parties.

Mr. Renzaho, I would like you to peruse this document, Exhibit P. 51.  
MR. CANTIER: 
I would like the registry to give that exhibit to Mr. Renzaho. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Which page do you want Mr. Renzaho to focus on in the French version?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, we'll look at paragraphs -- paragraphs that are found on page 23, 24, 25 and 26.  At each time I would mention the paragraph in question.  And for page 23, the first paragraph I'm going to use is the last one.  And I'll give you the K reference, because I have only the French version here.  So French version, page 23.  English version, page 10.  And then French version, the reference is K0264709, and the English version is K0111163.  And the French version it is the last paragraph.  And in the English version it is midway down the page.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Renzaho is now given page 23 and the following pages.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, we are on page 23 and the last paragraph.  Please read that paragraph and give us your comments, knowing that the paragraph extends to the next page.  
A.	"I would also like to inform you that as part of activities to beef up security, especially to check looting, banditry and killings, I held a meeting with leaders of political parties at the préfectoral and communal levels, which was very useful because it gave us the opportunity to exchange ideas.  We realised that all the authorities should spare no effort to make the population understand that these acts of violence will not help us win the war, and that they should, rather, avoid such acts so we should be united and in a position to fight the enemy that has attacked us in our zones, sharing for better or for worse."  
Q.	End of quote.  Yes, Mr. Renzaho, what is the meaning?  And what I'm interested in, as I mentioned a while ago, is to see whether in that paragraph there is no indication of your collaboration with the political parties. 
A.	Well, Counsel, anything that could bring together persons who could contribute to restoring security was okay.  If the political parties could appeal to the militants to contribute to such peace, then I had nothing against using them to obtain that objective.  

Now, with respect to the present situation, what I do recall is that at the commune level I asked that political parties be involved in the management of the situation, and I did so under the recommendation of the minister of the interior who had asked the administrative authorities to involve all the influential groups and persons who could have mobilised the population to check the excesses, the killing, the destruction, and so on.  

But at my level at the préfecture of Kigali, I don't know if I'm being excessive here, but the big guys quickly left town, quickly left Kigali, and I was -- if I had managed to get political leaders within the préfecture of Kigali, I would not have found them.  Maybe one was left.  But the leaders of political parties left with the government, and some had even left before.  And I don't know how I would have managed to bring them together at the préfecture.  So I believe that -- those are some of the words that just go out, but I believe that I asked the communes to involve political leaders in the management of the situation.  Thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, in the same document on pages 25 and 26, I would like you to look at the last line of page 25 and the first eight lines of page 26.  In the French version, the reference is K0264711 and K0264712.  And in the English version, the passage is found in the reference K0111164, and on page 11, I believe.  

Mr. Renzaho, the question that comes up when you look at these statements that have been attributed to you, does it mean that you were essentially concerned in your activities -- concerned with the image of your country?  
A.	That is true, Counsel.  I was concerned about my country's image, and that is legitimate.  I've always thought that I could do everything within the context of my career.  I signed it, signed that I would do everything for my country.  And I was disturbed by the unfortunate fate of my country, and deep down I told myself that Rwanda did not deserve the tragedy that was rocking it.  

And so it is true that I -- I mentioned that the country had done a number of good things, and that Rwanda needed the help of the international community.  For years, we had lived in peace, in community, and in friendship and sound relations of the internal components of the country, and with sound relations with all our neighbours.  It was not Rwanda that had any hostile relationship with any country of the region, and I was saddened that in such a short time the entire world that we had constructed was collapsing, and the country's image, by the same token, was badly damaged.  I think I mentioned this.  Thank you.  
Q.	Yes, Mr. Renzaho.  You keep mentioning the word "tragedy".  What exactly are you referring to, so we can be clear on that? 
A.	Counsel, there is no other meaning to "tragedy" than the war we were experiencing, the disaster, the situation, and its increase on a daily basis.  The people who were killed, the people were killed on a daily basis.  And those who were wandering all over and who destroyed all they found on their way.  It was all of that situation, really unspeakable.  Seek to find a solution to it, but I couldn't.  It was an entire country that had gone under.

1615H 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, if you are through, I would ask you another question on another document.  It is a speech -- 
MR. CANTIER: 
I apologise, Mr. President.  So can I move on to P. 20 -- I'm sorry.  P. 54.  It's an interview of 22 April.  This passage has also been -- was used by the Prosecution, and in the French version the reference is K0246838, page 20; and in the English version K0272361, page 13.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Since it's a short passage I may just read it out, and the Chamber will hear the interpretation in English.  

Mr. Renzaho, in the French version the passage is in the middle of the page, the second paragraph on page 20, line 7.  And the passage begins with:  "That is why".  Are you there?  
A.	Yes, I'm there, Counsel.  
Q.	So I'm going to read it out; it's not long.  

"That is why I would call on you to make every effort so that the -- the organisation of patrols should be improved so that opportunity should not take advantage of it to attack the innocent population.  We are beginning to realise that these criminal activities are happening in some secteurs where some young persons combine with unscrupulous soldiers to assault members of the population by extorting money from them and by looting houses."  I have ended the quote.  

According to the Prosecution witness Alison Des Forges, it was an absurd effort to shift responsibility for a programme organised by the administration.  So, what is your understanding and how do you interpret this passage?  
A.	Counsel, I'm going to answer, even if it saddens me.  My first observation is that there were excesses that had to be checked.  If I had some other means to react other than speech, other than speaking, I would have used that means.  But as a proverb of my people says, weaklings have no other weapons than their tongues.  I was reduced to using only my tongue.  That maybe leads us to the relevant question:  Could my tongue be of any use?  I think that it was better than nothing, because if more substantial or more effective means had been found, they may have been used to address that deplorable situation.  And so I tried to use statements, incited them, hoping there would be people of goodwill to listen to those words and apply them.  Would it have been better not to have said them?  I would have had a lot of remorse on my conscience not to have done anything in as much as I could have done any -- something.  That's what I did.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I will now move on to a speech -- actually, these are not speeches but interviews issuing on the radio -- a statement that you made on -- a radio interview of 6 May 1994 which is found under reference, in the French version, K0215881.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, we don't have an English version.  This document was tendered by the Prosecution under P. 55.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I am going to read out the -- the sentence in question, and so it may not be useful for you to have the document before you.  It's an easy quotation, and my question will also be easy.  Here's the sentence:  

"In actual fact, nobody can claim to love his country more than the others, except for traitors.  One can thus say that those persons are traitors, but -- and they do not love their country, but there is overzealousness."  

And this is the sentence:  "It is this overzealousness that indisciplined people are killing blindly, and we oppose this kind of thing very firmly." 

Mr. Renzaho, still according to Witness Alison Des Forges, the fact that you asked people not to kill blindly meant that they should kill with -- they should kill selectively.  So what is your answer to that interpretation, and how can you explain that statement?  Mr. Renzaho, we worked on this document this morning when we mentioned your various statements that were broadcast on the radio.  
A.	I am deeply convinced that nobody has the right to kill.  Nobody has the right to kill his fellow man.  And I feel that it is already some kind of conviction without judgement to attribute to somebody the intention of ordering persons -- or, ordering a person to kill selectively.  I was an agent, and I've explain this all through the questions that you've asked me, that there was the absence of -- of legal structures.  And I may add that people should understand that in the terrible tragedy that we experienced, at no time was there a legal provision that could give a préfet, that I was, exceptional powers.  Such exceptional powers in other circumstances, and in some periods in history, others persons would have used such powers to kill people, to do other things, but I never had that kind of idea.  And in the context in which I worked, the context was never that kind of context.  

So I don't know how I could have incited all the grass roots people to kill.  Who?  I believe that my family went through, they had problems.  Some members of my family were killed in some places.  Is that the meaning of killing selectively?  I think that that kind of reasoning -- well, I respect people's opinions, the opinion of the person who expressed it, but I don't identify with that strategy.  The word was misinterpreted.  

All I would like to say is that these persons, these enraged -- these crazy persons who attacked everybody, who killed for no reason, whereas instructions had been given to arrest people and take them to some administrative structures.  Well, we did not have the legal structures, but these people had to discharge their duties and arrest those who had to be arrested and send these people to the bourgmestre and to the others.  And if these people went beyond the instruction, then they are the criminals.  But one cannot attribute responsibility to an authority in that way of killing or asking people to be killed.  Frankly, I don't identify with it, and once again I feel really saddened to be involved in that kind of thing.  It is not my nature.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I thank you.  I think the Chamber has understood your explanations.  

I would like to present a new document to you, a document dated 10 May 1994.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Still another radio interview, Mr. President, Your Honours.  It is Exhibit P. 56, Prosecution Exhibit P. 56.  It's in French on page 19.  And the English version is page 12.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	So, on the English version it is found on page 12, and the K number is K0365211.  And the French version, Mr. Renzaho, K0337480.  

Mr. Renzaho, I wish for you to refer to the second paragraph.  And in the English version I believe it is the second as well as the third paragraphs.  Page 12 of the English version.  

So, Mr. Renzaho, in order to make progress, I wish to read out to you the sentence that was underscored by the Prosecution witness.  

"It is necessary for the guidelines adopted in this matter to be observed, and it is the reason for which we have decided to arrest any individual who would not observe them and who would be perpetrating criminal acts, for them to be punished.  For example, we have punished about three people, which means that we started checking whether the directives were observed."  

Mr. Renzaho, Prosecution Witness Alison Des Forges stated that this proved that you had the requisite authority since you had been able to arrest three people, but that you did not wish to make more efforts in order to arrest more people.  

Mr. Renzaho, what do you say to that?  
A.	Once again, one cannot force other persons to think as one does.  So my answer, Counsel, is that when one says that we had been able to arrest three people and that we could have arrested more, well, yes.  That is true.  It could have been that way if everybody had acted in order to obtain such a result, and if the circumstances had allowed us to do so.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Who were these three people?  Who were these three people?  Very briefly.  
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, I referred to them subsequently.  There's Sukari, Kigingi, and the persons we had arrested in the Rugunga cellule.  And besides, there were not only three people, there were more than that.  

But to come back to the charge brought against me, let me tell the Trial Chamber that I have never been an actor, even though this is what is contained in the allegation.  On the one hand, I allegedly made positive speeches, and on the other hand I allegedly let people die.  And I allegedly let them die when I was in a position to put an end to the killings.  This is what I'm being accused of.  But I do not wish to abuse the patience of the Trial Chamber, but perhaps I should be given some time and my counsel should be -- should give me more time to express myself on this issue.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I am aware that this is a painful exercise, and that we have spent a number of hours at it today.  I would like to seize this opportunity to reiterate to you the advice I gave you on several occasions, and which I also gave you at the beginning of the session.  Please try to answer the questions put to you directly, and perhaps you can provide subsequently additional explanations which I might require of you by putting an additional question to you, if need be.  

I would like to state once again that we are not here to prevent you from speaking, but at the same time we are trying to make sure that your utterances will be of some use.  Is there something you wish to add to what you just stated, Mr. Renzaho, on this matter, which is indeed important, which we had already dealt with, but which is referred to here once again?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I believe the situation was out of hand.  We were living in chaos as I mentioned -- as was mentioned in the different documents we looked at throughout the proceedings.  And I believe this was no play act.  Those were the realities, people were dying, people were wandering, people were losing all their belongings.  And they were in utter despair.  And the reason for the situation was well known.  Some people showed some goodwill to put an end to this situation, but this led to nothing.  

Let me tell you, for example, quite frankly, that I was one of those who proposed, during the crisis committee meeting that took place on the 7th, the crisis committee, I was amongst those who proposed that a delegation be set up under the aegis of UNAMIR in order to request from the RPF that it stop the fighting, because we were living in a situation of very -- we were living in very tense conditions, and we had all the excesses -- we were faced with all the excesses I mentioned here.  But unfortunately we were not heard.  We repeatedly made such a request, but it was never accepted.  So under such circumstances, the two contradictory situations that are referred to, it's as if one was not accountable to the international community, whereas, on the contrary, others were in a disastrous situation, because people who could have settled the matter were not willing to do so.  So this is what I was referring to.  And I'm accused of acting.  That is not the case.  
Q.	Very well, Mr. Renzaho.  Mr. Renzaho, still in the same vein -- and we're reaching the end of the exercise -- I wish for you to refer to a statement made by the same witness.  It was the result of the exercise of the Prosecution with Witness Alison Des Forges at speech dated 8th of June 1994, which can be found in Exhibit P. 61.  
MR. CANTIER: 
We do not have the English version of this document.  In the Prosecution binder it is in volume 3, tab 15.  P. 61, as I was saying.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Page, in French?  
MR. CANTIER: 
So, Mr. President, in French it is on page 27.  The K number is K0369189.  And it is at the top of the page.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, let me read it out to you.  So, once again, these are interviews and not communiqués, a page that was used by the Prosecution, and its witness says the following, and I quote:  

"Here in town, people who wanted to loot shops were killed so that the movement was quelled.  However, we noted that these bandits have invented a new trick which is -- which consists in putting fire to the stores.  For example, they have just put fire to three stores, and I asked that this problem be solved today.  I demanded that a report be made on the setting up of roadblocks, as well as on the people who are charged with the protection of the stores in the business district -- in the trading centre, so that if there is any incident, those would be the persons to provide explanations."  End of quote.  

Mr. Renzaho, Witness Alison Des Forges stated that the authorities were more concerned with the cessation of the lootings than that of the killings.  What is your reaction to such a statement?  
A.	There was looting and there was killing at the same time, and there were also other activities carried out.  My concern was broader than that, I believe.  I did not merely refer to lootings.  I was concerned by the situation in general in Kigali.  There were interventions that we conducted.  As far as I'm concerned, I am not aware of any incident that was made known to me and for which I did not intervene.  The only problem was to be able to identify the locations where such events were taking place and the people who were responsible for such acts, or to prevent such acts being committed, or be there immediately after they were committed.  

Perhaps an intervention in a trading centre is an action that was quite visible, and easier.  But it was much more complicated to identify each house where there was a death.  For example, I believe a witness came here to testify before this Trial Chamber and made a statement that was quite wise and relevant.  There was no demonstration where people were assembled and were killed.  If there were people killed, it was probably in houses in remote neighbourhoods.  And who brought that to our attention?  Who warned the authorities that something was going to happen in specific locations?  That is the difference.  

I believe the allegation, according to which we would have been more concerned with the protection of property -- and let me say that I was in charge of Kigali, and the shops belonged to the Tutsi to the tune of 65 per cent, and to a few foreigners.  But what I'm stating here is true.  So I protected the property -- these properties in order to fill my own pockets while populations were being killed?  I believe priority would have been granted to persons, but it was difficult to identify these people, and it was difficult to guarantee that actions would be prevented before they were committed because of the disorder that was reigning.  Thank you.  
Q.	Monsieur Renzaho -- 
MR. MOSES: 
I'm sorry to interrupt my friend.  I note -- I don't know whether this is a suitable time for me to comment on the motion.  If my friend's got a question which is only going to take five minutes, then it's his examination-in-chief and I don't want to interrupt it now.  But bearing in mind that the issues that we have been dealing with have taken more like 10 to 15 minutes -- I leave it in my friend's hands.  But I just want to indicate that I am in a position to assist the Trial Chamber further.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Wouldn't that be a good idea now, Maître Cantier, that we come back to the motion for the addition of the witness, to see how it is developing?  
MR. CANTIER: 
By all means, Mr. President.  I see no problem with that.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you for coming back so quickly, Mr. Moses.  
MR. MOSES: 
I have received -- in fact, this afternoon we made some enquiries, and there have been some investigations carried out.  They're not sure whether there will be other ones which they can carry out in Rwanda or not.  I'm of -- to be quite blunt, I'm obviously quite reluctant to say, yes, I can go ahead, as if that is a concession on the Prosecutor's part that we are agreeing to the motion.  And I can indicate that I'm not.  

But, if Your Honours were of a different opinion, can I say at this stage I would prefer the evidence to conclude next week.  I understand that Professor -- or, Mr. Lugan is to testify.  I can, in terms of scheduling, indicate that I don't expect to be much more than an hour or -- with him, and some of that will be in the qualification process which we've indicated our opposition to, his being qualified as an expert.  So even if that was -- he was qualified as an expert, I don't expect my -- for my part, the evidence -- the cross-examination to be very long at all.  

Having spoken to my learned friend, I think he is, in terms of scheduling, asking perhaps that Professor Lugan commence his testimony on Monday afternoon, because I think he's only arriving Sunday night.  And I certainly don't have any difficulty with that.  My learned friend, without binding him, I think felt he was going to take perhaps four hours.  And -- so, in any event, I don't expect his testimony to run beyond Tuesday.  

Because of my team situation, it would -- if the Trial Chamber -- and as I say I'm not encouraging Your Honours to make such a ruling.  But if Your Honours do so, I would ask that perhaps the witness be brought to testify on the Thursday, which would at least give me some time to prepare the cross-examination on the Wednesday, and perhaps gives my learned friend some time to also prepare the witness, if the motion was granted.  

Can I just put a proviso on that, and I haven't had the opportunity to speak to the investigator myself.  I'll try and do that after leaving court and see if there are further investigations which they are planning, and when they can carry out such investigations and whether they can carry them out by the beginning -- or, Tuesday next week.  Obviously if I do that, the preparation -- the level of investigations would be contained to matters in Kigali, but it may be that we can limit ourselves to those -- that nature of investigation without compromising our case.  

So, if I could perhaps finally get back to you when I have spoken to the investigator and -- but I don't know if what I've just told you assists or not.  I think it would -- I think it's preferable, if we can, to complete and conclude this case by the end of next week as it was scheduled, one way or other.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  

The Defence application for an additional witness to be heard was a problematic request.  It's a borderline issue.  The assessment has been complicated.  We are particularly concerned that it is important for the Prosecution to perform its task, that it has sufficient time for investigation, and it's clear that the Prosecution is, in this instance, in a difficult position.  Nevertheless, we think that, having heard both parties and the various arguments, that we will, under the circumstances, grant the application, but we will then certainly not let this witness testify before Wednesday the 4th in order to give the Prosecution some time to prepare.  
And should the OTP feel, at the end of next week, that it has not been able to perform its investigation in a satisfactory manner, then you can address us and we will then consider whether you need an additional remedy in order to avoid suffering prejudice.  This said, it is our hope, as the hope of everyone in the courtroom, that we will finish by next week.  

So that should then provide the necessary clarity in relation to this application of the Defence, which has then been granted.  And the witness protection unit should then be informed accordingly.  

And we want to thank you, Mr. Moses.  

It's 5 o'clock.  We could probably then continue tomorrow morning at 8:45.  

What is your timeline now, Maître Cantier?  How much time do you think is left of your examination-in-chief of Mr. Renzaho, approximately?  I'm asking for planning purposes simply.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I've done two thirds of it, I think.  So given this tempo, I think I will need another day or two to be through.  I believe I would have covered the essential areas, but I think I will have to take more time because I've received documents from the Prosecution which will lead us to ask additional questions.  So I believe at the latest tomorrow evening I will be through.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you for that indication.  That will give Thursday and Friday for cross-examination.  

Is that sufficient for you, Mr. Moses?  
MR. MOSES: 
I would think so.  It's -- it's difficult to know, Your Honours, because a simple -- I mean, it's no criticism of this witness at all, it happens with all witnesses.  You can ask what you think may get a short answer and it requires a lot longer.  So I -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But in view of the very short duration of Professor Lugan next week, and that the Defence only wants apparently to start Lugan Monday afternoon, we still have some possibilities of flexibility should you run short of time this week.  All right.  

Anything else to be said this afternoon?  Defence?  No.  

The Court is then adjourned until tomorrow at 8:45.  Thank you very much.  
(Court adjourned at 1708H)
