MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you will be referred to as Witness RC32 (sic).  You have to tell the truth and the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
(Declaration made by Witness RCB2 in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have a document there, Mr. Witness, with your signature, isn't that so? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The information in this document is correct, isn't it? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it is correct.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The next exhibit number for the Defence, Mr Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA:
D. 59. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal.  
      (Exhibit No.  D. 59 admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
And we are aware that there is one pending Defence exhibit request, but we will only decide that after having read that document. 

Judge Arrey has better eyesight than me.  The pseudonym is RCB-2; that's the pseudonym.  

Defence, it's your witness, please go ahead.
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Mr. President.
WITNESS RCB2, 
first having been duly sworn,
 testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness, RCB2, were you in Rwanda in April 1994 and if, yes, what was your occupation at the time? 
A.	I was in Rwanda in April 1994, and I was a gendarme.  
Q.	What was your rank in the gendarmerie, and in which unit did you work as a gendarme? 
A.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under separate cover) 
Q.	Witness RCB2, could you be more specific as to the secteur in which you worked, for the benefit of the Court? 
A.	I worked in Remera secteur. 
Q.	Witness, did you work in a brigade, a company or a detachment, as you mentioned a short while ago? 
A.	I worked in a brigade which was part of the Remera territory -- or, territorial company. 
(Pages 60 to 61 by Jean Baigent)

























     1615H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, how many persons were there with your rank in the Kigali detachment?  
THE WITNESS:
There were many non-commissioned officers, and I am not able to give you a specific number. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
More than ten?  
THE WITNESS:
Are you talking about the number in the company or in our unit?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence, do we need to place that answer under seal?  That's the point.  Isn't that the best thing to do?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I think we could place it under seal in view of the witness's identity.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we will place what is at 16:13:46 under seal, that answer.  

Please proceed.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, how was your unit organised, in view of the discharge of your specific duties, and what were those specific duties?  
A.	Prior to the war, I was ************************** at the brigade, and the other gendarmes were expected to accompany me in the discharge of my duties.  In the evenings, they would supervise people who had been arrested.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  How many gendarmes were there in a brigade at that time?  And I am referring to the period before the 6th of April, before the war.  
A.	The brigade had a squad, and two other squads were dispatched to areas where there was insecurity.  There was one squad at Kabuga and another one at Giporoso, because those were two locations at which acts of insecurity were being carried out.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness, am I to understand that there were three squads in a brigade, one in charge of judicial police activities -- and that is the squad to which you belonged -- and two others, which were in charge of security.  Is that a true representation of your answer?  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Witness, how many gendarmes would you have in a squad? 
A.	A squad would be made up of three sections, and in each section there would be -- there were 11 people.  And the squad had a chief, a deputy chief, a driver, and an operator.  So, in total, you would have 11 people in the section of a squad.  There was a head, the deputy head, the driver and the operator, bringing the total number of the brigade to 37. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, Witness, turning to the ************** activities of the brigade, which other authorities did you work with or collaborate with? 
A.	I worked in collaboration with the brigade commander and the company commander, as well as the other gendarmes with whom we worked within the context of the military setup.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When a ********************************** was completed, were the findings of such an investigation forwarded to another authority or did they remain within the ************ section?  And, if they were forwarded, to whom would such findings be forwarded?  
A.	When an offence was established, a case file would be prepared and forwarded to the prosecutor who would then initiate proceedings. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Within the context of its judicial police activities, did the gendarmerie often work in collaboration with the policemen of Kigali town? 
A.	The gendarmerie had no relations with the police force of the Kigali-ville -- the gendarmes came under the authority of the army, whereas the police force of Kigali-ville fell under the authority of the civilian administration. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did it ever happen to you personally, as you sought to establish an offence, to work in collaboration with a policeman? 
A.	No, that was not possible.  I was a gendarme, and I was expected therefore to work in collaboration with other bodies of the gendarmerie.  I could not work with the police because there was no relation between the police and the gendarmerie. 
Q.	Regarding the other activities for law and -- law enforcement and order, did the brigade, the gendarmerie brigade at which you worked, have relations with other levels of the gendarmerie? 
A.	I discharged the duties that were assigned to me by my superiors, and I did not have any relations with other levels.  I worked, therefore, in collaboration with my hierarchy and with other gendarmes under my command.  I did not collaborate or work with any other authorities. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, Witness, I would like you to clarify the other aspect of your activities to the Court.  I am not referring to your judicial police duties.  My question then is as follows: Regarding the other activities relating to maintenance of order and security, was there any connection between the police of Kigali town and the gendarmerie in the discharge of those duties? 
A.	The police of Kigali-ville never collaborated with the gendarmes.  At least, during the period when I was in Kigali, I never witnessed any such collaborative activity.  
Q.	Thank you for that clarification, Witness.  Still within the framework of those two missions of the gendarmerie, was the préfet of Kigali considered to be your hierarchical superior in the context of the discharge of your duties? 
A.	The préfet of Kigali-ville was never integrated into our activities at any level whatsoever. 
Q.	Was it, however, possible, Witness, for the préfet of Kigali-ville to issue instructions and orders to gendarmes and expect them to comply? 
A.	I personally believe that the préfet of Kigali-ville could not issue orders to the gendarmerie because that was not within his purview. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, prior to the 6th of April 1994, did you know the préfet of Kigali-ville? 
A.	Yes, I knew the préfet of Kigali-ville because he was a figure of authority in Kigali-ville.  I knew him by name, I knew the location of his office.  But there was no other relationship between us.  We had never met each other, be it at some location or at an event.  However, I knew him by name. 
Q.	Could you tell the Court the name of that préfet whom you knew? 
A.	The préfet of Kigali-ville was known as Tharcisse Renzaho. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  As far as you know, Witness, what authority did the préfet of Kigali-ville have? 
A.	It is very difficult to answer that question.  All I can say is that he was préfet of Kigali-ville, and he had specific duties, and I believe that he is in a better position to tell you about his duties. 
Q.	From what you as gendarmes perceived the préfet to be in Kigali, would you say that he was a civilian or a military figure of authority? 
A.	Personally, I considered the préfet of Kigali-ville as a civilian authority. 
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  Witness, if I understood you well, that civilian authority had no legal means of relating with the gendarmerie, according to you?  Is that right? 
A.	He was in a position to requisition gendarmes, but I think he could not give orders to the gendarmes.  If ever he needed the support of the gendarmes, he would use what is referred to as a requisition, otherwise he could not give orders directly to the gendarmes.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, when and under what circumstances did you hear of the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	I heard of the president's death at about 9 p.m.  I was near the brigade, where there was a drinking spot which was visited by UNAMIR personnel, and there were Belgian UNAMIR troops there.  I saw them stand up, and since I, too, was a soldier and was in charge of security, I asked myself why they stood up so suddenly without emptying their drinks.  So, immediately, I went to the brigade to find out from the brigade commander what had happened.  The commander arrived a few minutes later, and I told him -- or reported to him on what happened.  When he phoned the headquarters, he was told that President Habyarimana's plane had probably been shot down. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  For the purposes of the records, can you please specify the day of April, because you just talked about the evening when you were with UNAMIR troops, but you did not specify the date? 
A.	It was on the 6th of April 1994. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  After receiving that information from headquarters did you continue carrying out your usual duties? 
A.	The tasks of OPJ were suspended and the brigade commander ordered us to place ourselves in a defensive position around the brigade, and that is what we did until the following morning.  
Q.	Why did you have to put yourself in a defensive position?  Why did you have to take up defensive positions? 
A.	The brigade being close to the CND building where RPF troops were housed.  We had to take appropriate measures, knowing that the persons we were fighting against were nearby.  Therefore, we had to take the necessary security measures to protect ourselves, as well as the brigade installations.  
Q.	Thank you.  Did you therefore succeed in protecting yourselves as well as the brigade installations thanks to the measures you had taken? 
A.	Until morning there was no problem, but during the day at around 12 noon or 1 p.m., RPF troops attacked us and we had to flee in order to retreat to Kicukiro. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That place is known, thank you.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, when you retreated to Kicukiro, were you attacked once more?  If yes, on which date?
A.	There were many attacks because our troops had given up their positions around Kanombe, and RPF forces were coming closer to us and were shelling us with mortars.  In fact, there was even direct contact.  And, on every occasion, we had to try and beat them back.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  For how long were you thus able to beat them back?
A.	We spent about one month at the ETO? 
Q.	And at the end of one month, what happened to you? 
A.	The RPF grew in strength.  They were superior to us, so we had to abandon that position and retreated to Mburabuturo in Gikondo neighbourhood. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When you resisted the RPF, who were becoming stronger than you, did you have to ask for reinforcements from the population? 
A.	How could we have asked for reinforcements from the local population, given that they were not soldiers?  We never asked for the support of the members of the local population.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  The Interahamwe militias, did they come to fight alongside you? 
A.	Wherever I was, I never saw the Interahamwe come to the war front. 
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  Throughout that period of your resistance, did you ever hear a message from the préfet of Kigali-ville ordering the population to erect roadblocks in order to ensure your defence? 
A.	I never heard such a message. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness RCB2.  And for how long were you able to resist in that new position in which you found yourselves? 
A.	I no longer remember exactly how long we stayed at that position, but it must have been around two weeks. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness RCB2.  Do you remember the date when you left that position?  And can you also tell the Chamber what happened to your troops? 
A.	When we left Mburabuturo in Gikondo, we continued towards Muhima.  So, during that time, we had to protect the position that was found on the highway, and that is where I was.  I was, therefore, included in the mobile brigade, the high command of which was in the Muhima camp. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  In which month was that, Witness?  Do you remember the month when you were in the Muhima position? 
A.	It was around the end of the month of May. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  In all those movements, right up to the end of the month of May, what did you personally notice within the population?  Were there killings going on? 
A.	The fact that there were killings amongst -- well, it is a fact that there were killings amongst the population, but you could only notice that in the morning.  It was only in the morning that you would notice the killings that had been perpetrated at night, but we would be unable to identify the authors of the killings.  But it was obvious that the killings had taken place amongst the population. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness RCB2.  Some of you, in your squad, did you engage in such killings, sometimes? 
A.	No, none of us did engage in such killings.  
Q.	Thank you.  In that new position in which you were from the month of May, as far as you are concerned, what was your perimeter of defence? 
A.	A squad comprises 33 active troops.  That means that between one position and another, you had a distance of 5 metres, and we were deployed in the form of a circle. 
Q.	Yes, Witness.  I would like you to tell the Chamber, as far as you are personally concerned, that is you, Witness RCB2, the range in which you operated and the number of persons with whom you operated? 
A.	I told you that we had only one squad, and I told you that between one position and another there was a distance of 5 metres. 
Q.	What specific task did you carry out from the position you held?  I mean you specifically, Witness RCB2, what specific task did you carry out? 
A.	I was the ********************************************************************************************* appoint those who had to go on patrol.  We also had to watch RPF troops or elements that could lay ambush on the highway, because that highway was used by many vehicles. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness RCB2.  When you talk of the major road or highway, can you specify which major road you are referring to?  And could you also tell the Chamber the area in which you carried out your patrols? 
A.	The major road is the road which is generally referred to, quote, unquote, avenue Poids Lourds.  It was below the Kiyovu neighbourhood that goes to Nyabugogo.  Therefore, we patrolled on the road that linked Kacyiru to that major road, because the other access roads had been taken by RPF troops and it was no longer possible to pass through those -- or to use those other access roads.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  In the area you patrolled were there locations where there were refugees that were protected by the gendarmerie?  
A.	Behind our position -- above that position there was the Sainte Famille church.  At that location, there were refugees.  Since RPF troops used to lay ambush in that area, we had to organise patrols in the said area to see to it that there were no mines laid.  And the members of the population would come and alert us as to the mines that had been laid by the RPF troops.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness RCB2.  Apart from mines which you have just referred to, what was the exact situation of the fighting on the ground, if you remember?
A.	In the secteur that was under my control, RPF soldiers used to shoot at positions held by our forces using machine-guns, or they would throw shells at those positions.  Since we disturbed them or forestalled their efforts to infiltrate, they would attack our positions.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness RCB2.  And those attacks, or the exchange of gunfire between your forces and RPF troops, did they have any effect on population movement in your area? 
A.	RPF troops had set up a mortar in the Kacyiru area, they had also set up a machine-gun Nyabugogo.  These two weapons or firearms were shooting at the sites or locations occupied by the refugees.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I do not know whether the two names that have been mentioned should be spelled.  I think they should be on the spelling list we have.  Nyabugogo --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's easy, thank you.  And the other one as well.  The two names were Nyabugogo and Kacyiru (sic).  
THE WITNESS:
Gaculiro.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness makes a correction of the name.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, do we agree that the spelling is K-A-C-Y-I-R-U?  That's the one, isn't it?  
THE WITNESS:
I mentioned a weapon which had been set up above Nyabugogo.  I also mentioned another weapon which was set up at Gaculiro, it's not Kacyiru. 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Gaculiro is spelt at follows: G-A-C-U-L-I-R-O. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
This is a spelling from the Kinyarwanda booth. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I intend to move on to my last line of questioning, which, perhaps, would perhaps take up to 40 minutes.  I wonder whether it's appropriate to start now or to wait until tomorrow.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's appropriate to wait until tomorrow.  Thank you very much for that suggestion.  

I understand that we have a revised spelling list from the Prosecution now.  There is a huge document just having been distributed with 293 names, which is very similar to the previous Prosecution list.  
MS. MELLUISH: 
It's a wonderful list, but it's not come from this bench.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is this from the Defence?  So, with other words, this five pages spelling list, which is very, very useful indeed, comes from the Defence, and it replaces the updated Defence list of 84 names dated the 4th of June.  Is that so?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
That's entirely correct, Mr. President. That is the new updated list.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much to the Defence.  

Do we all have this revised huge list?

Please make sure it's distributed to everyone in the courtroom.  

Anything else we need to deal with before we adjourn for the day.  
MR. MOSES: 
Just briefly, Your Honour.  Just to advise, if my friend is only going to be 40 minutes, I don't think I am going to be very long in cross-examination.  So it would be useful, from an administrative point, if the next witness were brought tomorrow morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
If the witness protection unit could bring the next witness already from 8:45 tomorrow morning, he will probably not have to wait long.  

Any other administrative matters?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
None, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Then we adjourn for today, and continue again tomorrow at 8:45.  Thank you. 
(Court adjourned at 1700H)
