P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning.  The Court is in session.  

Before hearing the testimony of Mr. Renzaho, I want to ask the Defence whether you want to tender as an exhibit the sketch drawn by Witness PER on Friday.  I'm not sure that was exhibited. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President.  We do, indeed, wish to have it admitted into evidence.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 81. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  And there seems to be no need to place that under seal.  
(Exhibit No. D. 81 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Shall we, then, ask Mr. Renzaho to take his place in the witness box?  If you could kindly come forward.  

The headset is available.  

Good morning, Mr. Renzaho. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You are about to give testimony.  You have to tell the truth, and the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
(Declaration made by Tharcisse Renzaho in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is there any personal information sheet for Mr. Renzaho?  I suppose much will be clarified during the testimony; so maybe we could just ask you to indicate your date of birth, Mr. Renzaho.  
THE WITNESS:
I was born on the 17th of July 1944.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  I think I will leave the rest to you, Mâitre Cantier.  You have the floor.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, I'm much obliged, Mr. President.  

Two clarifications before I start my examination-in-chief.  First of all, Mr. President, Your Honours, I seek your leave in order to be able to meet with Mr. Renzaho during the examination-in-chief, because I was not given the authorisations I asked for to UNDF, especially during the weekend.  So this is my request to you.  

My second observation has to do with the motion which we submitted to your Trial Chamber regarding the disclosure by the Prosecution of a number of documents which came in support of the indictment of Mr. Wenceslas Munyeshyaka.  If I were to be given such documents, they would be quite useful to me for the examination-in-chief of Mr. Renzaho.  

I had a discussion with my learned brother from the Prosecution on this matter since, as the Trial Chamber's aware, first of all, there was a refusal on the part of the Prosecution, and following the filing of the motion the Prosecution made contact with me and counsel for the Prosecution indicated that he would, indeed, provide to us the documents we were asking for.  

I wish to inform the Trial Chamber that we are waiting for such documents to be provided to us.  And perhaps my learned colleague can tell us at this stage when we will be given such documents.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Moses?  
MR. MOSES: 
Firstly, if you want a comment in respect of the first matter, the Prosecution has no objection to counsel meeting with the Accused during the course of evidence-in-chief.  

As to the second, rather than getting into an argument about whether the material does fall within 66B, and now that on Friday afternoon it was a more specific request, we have, as my friend has correctly indicated, agreed to provide all the material to the Defence.  And a CD-ROM with that material is being burnt, hopefully this morning, and we will be in a position to provide that, hopefully, before the lunch break.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That was very helpful.  So this means that the Defence motion dated the 24th August 2007 containing a request for disclosure of Munyeshyaka documents is moot.  The registry will note that.  

And we see no problems, then, that the Defence team meets with Mr. Renzaho during the examination-in-chief.  
MR. CANTIER: 
I'm much obliged, Mr. President.  

THARCISSE RENZAHO,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, good morning.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Then, only, the final issue.  I trust that everyone has the updated spelling list of the Defence dated the 26th of August, 2007.  

Please proceed.  
MR. CANTIER: 
I'm much obliged, Mr. President. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Renzaho, good morning.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	I am about to start your examination-in-chief, and I wish to publicly repeat the advice I gave to you previously.  That is to say, to answer the Trial Chamber in a direct, concise and precise manner, and also observe a pause, or at least not to answer my questions immediately after they are put to you since you have decided to answer them in French, but you should leave sufficient time for the interpreters to translate the questions I will put to you.  

Mr. Renzaho, my first question has to do with your social and family origins.  In a few words, could you tell the Trial Chamber what they are?  
A.	Counsel, before I answer your question, I wish to be given some time to express my emotion because of all the victims of the Rwandan tragedy.  Amongst the victims of this tragedy I have relatives, I have brothers and sisters, as well as friends.  Thank you.  

With regard to my origins, I was born in the Kabare-1 secteur, and not in the secteur mentioned in the indictment, which is in the Kigarama commune, in the former Kibungo préfecture.  I was born in 1944.  And as regards my parents, my father was called Habineza, Jean.  My mother's name is, since she's still alive, Muhimpundu, Christiane.  And I come from a family of farmers.  

I thank you.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, the name of Mr. Renzaho's father is number 147 on the list.  And as for his mother's name, it is under number 304.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And Kabare is number 182, I understand.  Yes?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, indeed, Mr. President.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, from the outset, let me put a question to you.  On the period from April to July of 1994, between the 6th of April and the 5th of July of 1994, did you go back to your préfecture of origin and in your commune of origin? 
A.	No, Counsel, I did not go to my commune of origin.  I did not go there since December of 1993.  
Q.	Sir, can you tell the Chamber, briefly, what education you received and what diplomas you have?  
A.	I went to primary school in the Kibungo Catholic parish.  After that, I studied Greek and Latin humanities at the minor seminary in Rwesero, in Kabgayi, and in Kigali, and I finished these studies in 1966.  I was awarded a diploma for general humanities.  From 1966 to 1967, I spent one year at the national university of Rwanda at the faculty of letters.  And after that, I entered the military school in Kigali.  I graduated from it in 1970 with a diploma in social and military sciences.  

Subsequently, I underwent a few training sessions, as was customary.  And later on, in 1980-1981, I followed the second cycle course at the war school in Brussels, and I also took a course for battalion commanders.  And I also underwent the training session for the battalion commanders at the Arlon school, infantry school, in Belgium.  And from 1987 to 1989, I took the higher course of general staff at the Hamburg military school in the federal republic of Germany.  And from there, I went back to Rwanda in July of 1989.  So that is what I can say.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, and all the names should be on the list, even though I am having problems finding them; the names that are not known, such as Arlon in Belgium, are on -- is, rather, on the list under number 17.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.      There was another name, the name of a location which you mentioned, Mr. Renzaho.  Was it Rwesero                          
	or Awasero?
A.	It's Rwesero.  R-W-E-S-E-R-O.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, that name was not on the list.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you for the spelling of that name.  And you mentioned Rwesero, Kigali, and was the third one Kabgayi?  
MR. CANTIER: 
That is correct.  Kabgayi.  It is number 186, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  We have everything now.  
MR. CANTIER: 
I wish to apologise, Mr. President, but from where I am I cannot see your microphone.  

Thank you very much.  Otherwise, I do not know when you wish to take the floor.  I thank you.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, so you underwent military training.  Can you tell us what was -- what were the different stages of your career as an officer?  
A.	My rank when I graduated was that of second lieutenant.  And I was the head of the platoon, and I was subsequently the commander of the company.  I was also an officer of the general staff working in different departments, including a combat unit.  And from 1984 onwards, I was appointed study director at the higher military school at the time when that school was changing its curriculum, its training curriculum, and was going from a system to another one based on four years of training.  And I left my post in 1987 in order to go to Germany to undergo the training -- military training -- and then I came back to Rwanda where I was appointed director of the programmes and study department at the ministry of national defence.  

I left that position on the 5th of October 1990 when I was appointed préfet of Kigali.  

I thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, in view of the military career you had, and which you just referred to, did you ever consider yourself as being one person enjoying privileges from the regime?  
A.	I believe, in view of the career I had, I did not refer to the different appointments, and I did not refer to some observations.  But frankly speaking, I do not believe I had any privileges -- or enjoyed any privileges from the regime, and I do not believe it's necessary to go into some details about some situations here.  But by merely observing my career from 1973 up to 1980, it is quite clear that I did not enjoy such privileges.  

I thank you.  
Q.	Yes, Mr. Renzaho.  You did not tell us what rank you had when you stopped exercising your military prerogatives to become a préfet.  What was your rank at the time? 
A.	I apologise.  Perhaps this was this was an oversight on my part.  I referred to my rank when I graduated from school, which was second lieutenant, but I reached the rank of lieutenant colonel when I was appointed préfet of Kigali.  And while I was préfet, in July of 1992, I became a colonel.  I do not know whether I have answered your question.  

I thank you. 
Q.	Yes, indeed, that was what I wished to ascertain.  Mr. Renzaho, could you tell the Trial Chamber whether you were a member of any political party or organisation -- or political organisation?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before you answer that question, Mr. Renzaho, what was your rank when you headed this study programme just before the 5th of October?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I was lieutenant colonel. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  And then your answer to the question, please?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you for the question.  I was never affiliated to any political party or to any organisation.  

Thank you.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, were you aware of the contents of article 17 of the presidential act dated 13th of December 1978 which was, in fact, the discipline -- the rules of discipline for the Rwandan armed forces?  
A.	Yes, I'm aware of the existence of these rules.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, this is Exhibit P. 11 from other Prosecution bundle of exhibits.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I wish to read out to you this article 17, and please tell me whether your mind -- you are aware of its conditions:  "It is prohibited for serving soldiers to be affiliated to any political party."  

Mr. Renzaho, do you remember this particular article of the presidential act?  
A.	Yes, indeed, I'm fully aware of its existence, and I believe this was the reason for which I did not belong to any political party, because I maintained my status of soldier while I was a préfet at the Kigali préfecture.  I had been put at the disposal of a territorial administration, but I was still a military officer, even though I was exercising civilian functions.  

I thank you.  
Q.	Yes.  We shall come back to this matter of you being put at the disposal of the administration, Mr. Renzaho, when we will deal with your appointment as préfet.  

Mr. Renzaho, with regard to this banning, are you aware of article 21 of the law of the 18th of June 1991 on political parties in Rwanda?  
A.	Yes, Counsel, I'm aware of this law. 
Q.	Do you recall the provisions of article 21, or I shall remind them to you?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, Your Honour, this exhibit is in our bundle, volume 1, number 12.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	The law of the 18th of June 1991 on political parties, which states that "By waiver to article 20 of the present law, career magistrates, members of the armed forces and of the police -- serving members of the armed forces and the police, cannot endear to any political party."  

Mr. Renzaho, can you tell the Trial Chambers what residences you lived in from the time you were appointed préfet? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I was appointed préfet while I was living in an official residence on the Paul VI avenue.  I then moved from that residence to go to a residence on the plateau facing the secondary school, Notre-Dame de Citeaux, on the Notre-Dame -- on the hospital avenue.  Sorry.  And in May of 1992, I moved and went to reside in my own residence in the Nonko cellule, Nyarugunga secteur, Kanombe commune, in Kigali-rural préfecture. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President with respect to the different locations.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	The first location, Mr. Renzaho, is Longo -- Nonko -- Nonko.  Nonko is number 379 on our list.  Then you referred to a secteur, number 418 on the list.  And finally, the Kanombe commune, we are all aware of.  

Mr. Renzaho -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
A question:  This act of 18th -- the 13th December 1978 which contained article 17, that was the first provision you referred to.  That was before the multiparty system; whereas, then, the second legal provision of 18th of June 1991 was after the multiparty system.  Is that so?  
THE WITNESS:
I believe that is so, but perhaps I can provide some clarifications.  The rules of discipline of the Rwandan armed forces concerned me, at least in some of its provisions.  As for that legal provision, since I was an officer of the Rwandan army, I was also concerned by that same provision, and that is why he referred to it, because I was duty-bound to observe the rules of discipline.  

I thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So article 17 remained in force after the introduction of the multiparty system?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, indeed, Mr. President.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, were you asked to participate in the democratic process launched in Rwanda at the beginning of the 1980s -- sorry -- of the '90s.  
A.	Yes, I did participate in the democratisation process in the country from 1989.  I do not know whether I can elaborate on this matter to provide clarifications. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, you have just answered in the affirmative to the question I put to you.  Could you now tell the Trial Chamber what part you played in the democratisation process, and in the proceedings that led to the advent of multiparty democracy? 
A.	Thank you.  I believe there are two stages in this political activity of mine.  The first phase had to do with what the president of the republic called aggiornamento.  When I was the director of the studies and programmes department, my minister asked me to participate in the proceedings of a coordination -- of an inter-administerial coordination committee in charge of political matters; because the president of the republic had requested that the minister report to him on the wishes that had been expressed during the framework speech he had made during the previous legislature.  So several people from several ministries were asked to meet and to think about the military -- about the political situation in the country so as to identify those issues that would require the attention of the authorities in order to take into account the changes requested by the Rwandan population.  

So this is the phase I call aggiornamento, and this is the phase that we were in when I went back to Rwanda.  This was the period of political aggiornamento.  And I must say that it was not easy.  Because, of course, when you have a single party in power, there are forces that are against change.  But I was surprised to note that the report of the committee proceedings was endorsed by the president of the republic, who reported on it to the nation on the 5th of July of 1990.  

And at that time, he set up a national synthesis commission, and I was a member of that commission.  And this is now the second phase I was referring to.  At the time that this national synthesis commission was starting its work, Rwanda was attacked from Uganda on the 1st of October of 1990.  

We signed a petition, we thought that we were to be given guidelines as to what we were to do, whether we were to continue our task or not.  And the president asked us to continue with our task and to finalise it as rapidly as possible.  So we submitted the results of our work which was, in fact, a political charter, as well as a code of political ethics.  The political charter was the source of inspiration for the Rwandan constitution which was promulgated on the 10th of June 1991.  
I thank you.
  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You referred to article 21 in this act of the 18th of June 1991.  I understand that at least in some binders that provision is missing?  You may wish to check the photocopy and ensure that that provision is available to us, since you have referred to it.  

Then there was this name referred to by Mr. Renzaho.  Can you help us with this term, in connection with the first stage?  
THE WITNESS:
Aggiornamento.
MR. CANTIER: 
Just one moment, Mr. Renzaho, please let me answer in the order in which the questions were put. 

Mr. President, first of all, regarding the constitution, article 21 was in our third list of exhibits under number -- tab number 2.  Or rather, it is the one that was distributed this morning, I'm just being told, in document number 2.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And when you say document number 2, you haven't really marked it with a 2, but it is simply the second to be found?  With other words, the official journal, that's where we are to look.  Thank you very much.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, indeed, Mr. President.  Mr. President, aggiornamento is not a French word, and it's not a Kinyarwanda word, either.  It is spelled A-G-G-I-O-R-N-A-M-E-N-T-O.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It sounds suspiciously Italian.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Because it is Italian, Mr. President.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, the result of the proceedings you participated in, if we understood you correctly, was, in fact, a report of this national synthesis commission on the political reforms in Rwanda? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel.
MR. CANTIER:
And in that document, Mr. President, that document is on our third list, under tab 1.  

Yes, it's the binder that came this morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Let's be absolutely certain here.  We received an email on Friday, I think, entitled "Lists of exhibits in connection with the examination-in-chief of Mr. Renzaho."  That is a comprehensive document, and that has been printed out.  And then when we came in this morning, we found a folder with documents.  In addition, we have previously the Defence exhibits.  

So when you make these references to a folder, exactly which one are you referring to?  There are three possible interpretations.  If you could just help us.  You have just said that you are referring to what we found this morning, or what we got on Friday electronically?  
MR. CANTIER: 
It is the same thing, Mr. President.  Nonetheless, we wanted to bring the hard copy this morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So with other words, when you referred to numbers, they can be found not in what we got this morning, but it is indeed in what you sent us on Friday under 1608 bis?  That's where we find the numbers running from 1 to 21.  

Thank you.  I trust everyone in the courtroom has this document, including interpreters and stenographers.  If not, it should be available at some stage.  Let us proceed. 
MR. CANTIER: 
In fact, that is correct, Mr. President.  
BY MR. CANTIER: 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I'll present this report to you, the report of the national synthesis committee.  What does it advocate at the political level, basically?  
A.	Basically, I think the report advocates the opening up of the country to multiparty politics.  That is the main thrust of the report. 
Q.	Very well.  Mr. Renzaho, were you a member of this committee?  You spoke of two phases.  Were you part of the first phase aggiornamento, then the second phase the drafting of that report?  Is that correct? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel.  
Q.	When were you appointed the préfet of the city of Kigali, sir?  
A.	I was appointed préfet of the municipality of Kigali on 5 October 1990.  
Q.	When did you take the oath of office? 
A.	I took the oath of office on 5 October 1990 at about 4 p.m. in the afternoon at the Nyamirambo regional stadium in the presence of my friends who, like me, had been appointed bourgmestre.  So there were about three:  The bourgmestre of Nyarugenge, the bourgmestre of Kacyiru, and the bourgmestre of Kicukiro.  And we took the oath of office together before the minister of the interior, thank you. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, the three names mentioned, Nyarugenge is 417; Kacyiru is 191; and the third one, is Kicukiro.  

THE WITNESS:  
Yes.
MR. CANTIER:
It's number 245.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Now, sir, can you tell the Chamber, in your opinion, what were the reasons that led to your appointment to that post? 
A.	Counsel, I think it is a difficult question.  I was not in the secret of the powers that be to know the reasons that prompted them to appoint me préfet of the city of Kigali.  I believe that I was appointed following the incident that happened in the city of Kigali on the night of 4 to 5.  There were shootings that lasted all night.  And personally, I saw the arrival of the president where I was, because we had closed down our usual activities to reinforce the activities of the general staff, the army headquarters.  I was there at that time.  And so he got there at about 3 a.m., and he watched us work.  He saw the confusion into which the city was plunged.  

So I did not follow the part that came about immediately that morning, but I was told that there was an extraordinary council of ministers.  And while I was still at the army headquarters, one of the friends with whom I worked, told me, "We've just heard your name on the radio, and it would appear that you've been appointed préfet of the city of Kigali."  

I did not want to believe it.  But later on, the president came to the army headquarters and he convened me to his office, and he told me that he had actually appointed me préfet of the city of Kigali; and that he was not ready to fight on two fronts, and that the incidents of that night demonstrated clearly that there would be excesses.  And he said we were fighting at the borders.  If we have to add to that fighting within the city of Kigali, we'll never succeed.  

Then he told me that I had to contribute to bringing calm and stability and enable the state institutions to function properly, and to reassure the Rwandan population and the expatriate population in Kigali.  That is what he told me. 

But to answer your question, I think that there must have been reasons, since my appointment happened after the deliberations of the ministers in the council of ministers.  Now, I don't know what was discussed about me or the situation, because I did not read the report of that meeting.  

Thank you. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, so what do you think of the president's decision to appoint to the post of préfet a soldier, rather than a civilian?  Well, in addition, or quite apart from the reasons you've just mentioned now.  
A.	As far as I'm concerned, I think it was customary in the country that officers be appointed to civilian positions, and that was not limited to the second republic.  We have known officers that were appointed ministers in the first republic.  So, it was customary.  But what was exceptional in my case was probably the fact that the country was at war and that, really, the situation was deteriorating with the excesses that we had that night, and the general disorder that was seen in Kigali which could continue.  

So that was the situation.  So maybe there was a preponderant fact in the sense that those who initiated the disorder in Kigali did so in view of a specific objective.  Because with the continuation of such agitation, we had repeated urban guerrilla attacks from the RPF, and those attacks caused a lot of material and human damage.  But above all, those repeated attacks suddenly plunged the population into some kind of violence, or a vision, that progressively destroyed the social fabric.  

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT.  
But in such a situation, you need a hands-on person, an operative personality.  And why you?  You were then at the ministry heading a study programme?  
THE WITNESS:
That is true.  I was a research officer.  I was not heading a military operation on the ground, that is correct.  But why me?  Why not some other person?  I mean, that is what I was saying.  So I wasn't into the secret of the powers that be.  I could not know.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Sir, do you think that in the prevailing context of the time in Rwanda, that there were regional considerations that prevailed in your appointment?  
A.	Thank you.  I believe that all of this could form a pattern that I do not have the time to discuss here.  I realised, in the performance of my duties, that the position was highly envied, and it had a lot of problems because everybody in Kigali was fighting.  Fighting -- one -- one doesn't know why they were fighting.  And we were in the context of political change.  Parties.  Political parties are going to be set up and were going to carry out their main activities in Kigali.  And at the same time, we were prosecuting a war, so there were democratic measures that came up.  But there were restrictive measures linked to the security of the country that was threatened -- threatened a situation that some people considered sensitive.  And so maybe it was thought that somebody should be found who could help address that situation.  But I don't know.  

Then the second question that he asked, that has to do with regionalism.  So we're talking about competition from political parties, and then we were at war.  Was this not going to further compound the situation in the case of Rwanda, as we experienced it at the time?  And then, would that regional aspect, the usual antagonism between the north and south, was it not further going to poison the situation?  That was part of the complexity of the situation which, to my mind -- I wasn't told, but I thought that I was less of a problem than some other person who could be identified as being part of what I've just mentioned.  

And so these are some of the issues that could be considered.  But I believe that some other person coming from any given political party, with a known belonging to the north or to the south, would have raised a bigger problem than my person.  Because I felt I was performing that mission for everybody; the armed forces, the country.  I did not have any political party.  And I believe that may have played -- or counted in the appointment of my humble self to that position.  

Thank you. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, what was your administrative status following your appointment?  
A.	Thank you.  I believe that I maintained my status as an officer, and I also carried out civilian duties in that capacity.  My immediate superior was the minister of the interior.  But my administrative status was that I was still at the disposal of the army.  That is, at the end of the army, for purposes of promotion, army officers, as well as other civilian workers, have to be promoted.  So for that purpose, I remained under the ministry of the interior, but my status was that of an officer. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, did you enjoy the provisions of article 17 of decree law from 19 March 1994 to lay down the general statute of state workers? 
MR. CANTIER:  
It is in our folder of volume 1, Exhibit Number 51.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I will just recall the provisions of article 17 to you.  "State employees can be placed at the disposal of any state administration, or any other organism, while being regulated by their status."  Is that the provision?  
A.	Yes, Counsel, that is it.  
Q.	Likewise, Mr. Renzaho -- and this is in a bit to clarify your status following your appointment -- were you aware of the presidential order of 3 January 1997 to lay down the rules and regulations governing Rwandan army officers?  
MR. CANTIER: 
In the folder, the Defence folder, it is in the second volume, number 4.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I'll read out point 10 of that document to you:  "An officer may be transferred by a presidential order of the national forces to another service of the state.  He shall maintain his rights."  

Now, did the provisions of this statute apply to you at the time of your appointment as préfet of the city of Kigali?  
A.	Counsel, is there not a subparagraph after that?  I was not transferred.  I was placed at the disposal of --
Q.	So we're not talking about transfer?  
A.	It's about disposal. 
Q.	So you benefitted from that status, Mr. Renzaho? 
MR. CANTIER:
	It is a problem of speed.  I will see to it immediately.
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Renzaho, we have to watch out.  Since we are speaking the same language, we tend to move too fast with our questions and answers.  

Now, this is my question:  By virtue of the text that you've just seen, did you, administratively speaking, remain attached to the army and the ministry of defence?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  By virtue of that provision, I remained attached to the ministry of defence with respect to my career file.  That is correct. 
Q.	Consequently, the ban on belonging to any political party that we saw a moment ago in the text, did that ban still apply to you?  
A.	That is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We agreed to observe the pause. 
MR. CANTIER: 
The answer was in the affirmative.  It's a typical military answer, sir.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, following your appointment, what essential missions were entrusted to you by the president of the republic and your minister, the minister of the interior? 
A.	Thank you for your question, Counsel.  After I was appointed, I was given the mission, first, to implement law number 39/90 of 22 June 1990 -- law number 35/90, correction.  That is a law that raised the city of Kigali to an autonomous authority.  But I must state that there were duties relating to the property of the former council of Nyarugenge that I took over.  But in the meantime, it was split into three councils, or three communes, with a central préfectoral administration that was supposed to govern all of that.  So, priority was given to the implementation of the provisions of that law.  And I went to work immediately to identify a number of priority needs to find housing, or office space, for the commune; hire personnel; acquire equipment; and try to draw up a budget and execute it, and to get all the structures off the ground.  And I must say that it came at a bad time because funds had been earmarked for activities in the city of Kigali; but with the outbreak of the war, the funds were not available.  So the new authorities had to do their best to find recurrent expenditure for the préfecture and the commune.  
So that is what I had to do.  Obviously, there were other missions that were imposed by the situation and by the very nature of the position that I held. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
There is a difference between the English and the French version.  

We agree that the point of this act, and your initial tasks, were to administer the transition from a former Nyarugenge commune, to the préfecture.  Isn't that the point, Mr. Renzaho?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I believe I said I received the property of the former Nyarugenge urban commune, which was split into three communes, and for which we had to find infrastructure and personnel.  That is what I meant.  So the -- we had to recover all what we had to recover from the Nyarugenge commune, and then share them out to the three new communes that had been set up.  So that is what I meant.  And the property, of course, was inadequate because we were moving from one commune to three.  So two of the communes were essentially rural.  There was nothing.  It needed school, infrastructure, roads, but there was nothing.  

Thank you Mr. President.  
BY MR. CANTIER: 
Q.	Yes.  For greater clarity on your assumption of office, were you the first préfet of Kigali city to be appointed?  And did that happen within the framework of the law of 22 June 1990 to lay down the administration of the city of Kigali?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, that is Exhibit P. 14.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I was the first préfet of the city of Kigali, and my mission was to implement all what was provided for by the law you just mentioned.  

Thank you.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, what was going to be the essential thrust of your work following your appointment?  
A.	After I was appointed, I tried to set up the structure of the préfecture and the structure of the communes.  That is what I had just said.  And for the préfecture, there was a major problem; and the same, also, applies to the commune.  The major problem was related to personnel.  Because the personnel I met at the Nyarugenge commune were not skilled to perform the duties prescribed by the law.  So I had to recruit academics, follow the procedure in that area.  So it took a bit more time, five to six months at the very least.  And in the meantime, we had to operate, continue operating.  So we found office space for the three communes, shared out the available personnel, purchased some equipment, with time.  But we got down to work to try to implement the law and get the structure to operate.  
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Again, just for clarity in the records, you were the first prefect of the Kigali-ville préfecture, isn't that the situation?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is true, Mr. President.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, when you took office, did you participate in the repression following -- which followed the outbreak of the war of October of 1990?  
A.	No.  I did not participate in any acts of repression. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, could you tell the Trial Chamber what you know of the arrests that were made in the town of Kigali, but also throughout the country, from the 4th of October of 1990? 
A.	What I do know is that during the night from the 4th to the 5th in Kigali, around one in the morning, there were gunshots that led to reprisals, and there was shooting up until the morning.  I do not know what occurred in the rest of the country, whether there was also gunfire; that I am not aware of.  

And during the day of the 4th, there was a rumour in Kigali whereby there was an imminent attack that was going to take place, probably on the night of that same day, and this was information that was circulating amongst embassies in Kigali.  And, curiously, at that time, at the time announced, there was gunfire, so the security forces arrested people who were thought to be working with the RPF movement, which was not very well known in Rwanda at the time.  Because prior to the attack of the 1st of October of 1990, very few people knew what the RPF was.  So, some arrests were made, a number of people were arrested, as was observed by many people, and this was perhaps due to the war and to the tension that was pervasive.  But it is also, perhaps, due to the fact that the Rwandan population was caught unawares.  Because very few Rwandans were expecting an attack from any country on Rwanda since we had just spent 20 years in peace, and we had enjoyed friendship with all our neighbouring countries.  So it was an unpleasant surprise.  But there was panic, and I believe the security forces were excessive in their fulfillment of their task.  I do not understand how 8,000 people can be arrested in one single operation.  I believe there were a number of people they could have arrested.  But as for 8,000 people, I believe this was an excessive figure. 

So this was the atmosphere in the population when the war broke out in Rwanda.  Because, once again, one can say that apart from the problem due to the war, it was not a Rwandan hill that stood up and fought against another commune.  It was a war that was waged from Rwanda -- from Uganda -- sorry -- and this had an impact on the population.  I observed the population.  I observed how things were going quite well, how people were helping one another, how we shared everything within the population.  And throughout the war, the social fabric started deteriorating, and so on and so forth, and this led to a disastrous situation because of this war.  

I thank you.  
Q.	Yes, Mr. Renzaho, I was putting this question to you since, as you're well aware, the Prosecution claims that you were closely linked to this wave of arrests, and that as a consequence you played a significant part in the events of October of 1990.  So, can you tell us clearly who made those arrests and how the people who were arrested were subsequently treated by the legal services, as well as by the police force? 
A.	Well, I believe those who arrested these people are the gendarmerie, the central intelligence service, as well as the public prosecutor's office which intervened, as it should, taking into account its functions.  I also know that when the massive arrests took place, a national committee was set up, and this committee was headed by the minister of justice.  And the task of this committee was to sort out those who had been arrested.  Why?  Because it was clear that out of the 8,000 people, there were probably some people who were, indeed, wanted, whereas there were others that could be innocent.  And that is what we were able to observe subsequently.  But personally, I was not associated to this activity in view of the nomination -- of my nomination.  And if we look at my activities from my appointment until October of 1990, I was not involved in this operation at all which had started in the early morning of that day.  So this is what I can say.  

Perhaps before conclude, since you were wondering, and were saying that there were documents found here and there proving that the préfecture was involved in that activity, well, that is true.  The préfecture and the communes were requested to provide information on people and on their whereabouts.  Because, once again, when the massive arrests were made, people were not severally identified.  And subsequently, we had to deal on a case-by-case basis to determine that person X was arrested in the Gikondo secteur, and then we had to make sure that that person really lived in Gikondo, for example.  So we provided information as to the place where these persons lived, and we were asked to confirm whether those arrested really lived in the neighbourhoods where they had been arrested or where they were to be looked for.  

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did the police participate in the arrests?  
THE WITNESS:
The Nyarugenge police force -- or rather, the Nyarugenge commune did not have more than 25 policemen.  And I do not know whether, during the transition -- because the person that was in charge was to relinquish his duties to me, I do not know whether such duties were relinquished to the police force or not.  So as far as I'm concerned I cannot answer your question. 
I thank you.
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Mr. Witness, were you given any explanations as to why those people had been arrested?  
THE WITNESS:
I can provide the explanation.  The people were suspected of being RPF followers, or partisans within the country, and were suspected of preparing sabotage operations -- or mining operations; were suspected of looking for information to the benefit of the RPF.  And that was the reason why they were arrested.  

I thank you.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
So my question to you is:  Did you, as the prefect of Kigali, provide information about the people to be arrested?  
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, I must put myself in the context of the events.  I was appointed on the 5th of October of 1990.  I did not have any personnel to work with.  No department or body of the préfecture had been set up in order to be operational.  And I'm referring to two main bodies which are, in fact, two supreme bodies; the préfet only being there to implement orders from these two bodies.  So the security urban council and the commune council.  

Regarding the question you put, it is linked to the urban security body, which had not yet been set up.  And what we are to do is to be done in the framework of this urban security council.  It was set up subsequently.  And it is clear, in the documents available, that the matters that we deal with -- or dealt with within the framework of this urban security council.  
(Pages 1 to 18 by Vicki Eastvold)












1015H 
THE WITNESS (continuing): 
So on the 5th, on the 6th and on the 7th, I had no organ or body set up in order to be able to work.  I did not provide any information.  I was able to provide information once that council was set up, and I provided information on specific issues that were sent to me through correspondence to the national sorting committee.  It was that committee that addressed the commune directly in order to request information on persons who had been clearly identified.  So I do not know whether I have answered your question correctly.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
Yes, you have.  Thank you.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I am insisting on this matter because what you said a moment ago was not very clear, and I believe this is what led to the question by the Judge.  

Regarding the information you were requested to provide through your administrative structure, the information dealt -- did it concern people who had already been arrested, or persons who were to be arrested?  In fact, I'm putting the same question to you as the question put to you by the Judge, but it was not clear earlier on.  
A.	The information had to do with people who had already been arrested, and it was important to have such information for the sorting process so as to complement the individual files of the persons who had been arrested, in view of possible release.  And many of them were subsequently released.  I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, please slow down when giving your answers, will you?  Thank you.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	I wish to have shown to you an exhibit which is in our -- on our third list.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, it is document number 3.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	It is a report of the meeting of the sorting committee that you have just referred to.  And this report is dated -- Mr. Renzaho, this report is dated 23rd of October of 1990.  First of all, are you aware of the existence of this document?  
A.	Yes, Counsel, I know of the document. 
Q.	So, Mr. Renzaho, the document refers to the sorting task you have just referred to.  Did you see the names of those who were the members of this sorting committee, and can you remind the Trial Chamber of the position of the main members of this committee, apart from the minister of justice that you have already mentioned?  For example, were there magistrates as members of this committee?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  There were magistrates who were members of this committee, and the first one was the public prosecutor.  There were also other staff members of the public prosecutor's office, as well as the ministry of justice, as well as a few gendarmerie officers, if I'm not mistaken.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, still with regard to this episode of the large-scale arrests in October of 1990, the Prosecution claims that you played an active role in the sale of the property of some of the people who were arrested or some people who had fled Rwanda.  What do you have to say in the face of such an accusation?  
A.	Let me start by stating that I played no part whatsoever in the sale of the property of those who were arrested.  And I also wish to provide some clarifications on the situation of those who were arrested who were in Kigali, or the situation of traders who, shortly before the attack by the RPF, joined the RPF movement in Uganda.  That is a different matter altogether.  The people who were arrested could have members of their families who were not arrested, and the -- those members of their families could make sure that their property was safe.  But that was different from those traders who, before the attack by the RPF, went to Uganda to join the RPF forces, because they had left their property without anybody to watch over it, and this led to a very serious security problem.  But there was also the fact that they owed money to banking institutions.  

As far as I'm concerned, and with regard to the people who were arrested, I indicated that they were managed by a governmental committee, headed by the minister of justice.  And the same goes for those traders who had some property in the country and who had fled the country.  The government decision also included the cases of those traders who had fled, and I do know that the court of first instance of Kigali was entrusted with the matter, and that it was through a conservation order that this was done.  And the préfecture did not deal with any of those matters.  
Q.	Yes, Mr. Renzaho, can you tell the Trial Chamber what was the population in Kigali when you took office, or during the months or the years that followed?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before we move to that line, Maître Cantier, you wanted to make a point in connection with the issue of Mr. Renzaho's role in 1950 (sic).  The question arose about information provided about persons to be arrested, or who had been arrested, and you tried to clarify that issue for us.  In doing so, you referred to document number 3 in your last bundle of documents, and that document is presumably the letter from the minister of justice dated the 6 November 1990.  Then follows, in the binder, the report of this commission, which apparently held a meeting on the 23rd of October 1990.  And you asked about the members of that commission, and we're told that there were magistrates and -- at least in the sense that the general prosecutor was a member.  We see no judges in this collection of names, but we do see the prosecutor.  That's number 3.  

But what was then the link between this commission and the collection of information?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Monsieur le Président -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
With other words, what was the link between this commission and the role of the Accused?  He's not listed among the 12 members of the commission.  Does that mean that he was not a member, or that he was not present during the meeting?  Can you explain this to us by posing questions to Mr. Renzaho, please.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, indeed, I shall do so, Mr. President.  But let me provide a clarification to you right from the outset.  Regarding the letter you referred to, Mr. President, on the cover letter for the report, it is dated 6th of November 1990, and this letter, which was sent by the minister of justice, with copy to the presidency and the préfecture of Kigali town, this letter is in fact a cover letter for the report on the meeting of the 23rd of October.  So that was my clarification. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Renzaho, you have heard the concern expressed by the President, so I put the question to you:  You are not amongst the people referred to in this report of the meeting of the 23rd of October, but were you a member of that sorting committee?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I was not a member of that committee, and I believe no member of the territorial administration of Kigali town was a member either.  Perhaps I could provide some clarifications on the link that we could have had with that committee.  The persons who had been arrested had been arrested in different secteurs of the communes of Kigali town préfecture, and they were not identified before they were arrested.  It was during the sorting out process that specific information on specific cases were -- was -- were necessary.  And at the préfecture, the sorting committee would make requests for information on people who had been arrested, and for whom it was necessary to have additional information in order to settle their case.  And that is when there were exchanges of information on a case-by-case basis.  But we did not have any members within that committee.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, did you then provide information to the committee?  Was that your role?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I believe even other préfets were asked to provide information in that regard.  I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And then I see that, in French, I was translated as if I said that something happened in 1950.  I certainly said in English 1990.  So please, there should be no "sic" there in relation to what I stated.  All right.  
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Mr. Renzaho, should I take it that people who carried out the arrests of 8,000 people didn't know who they arrested?  They were not aware of their names and some other details?  
THE WITNESS: 
Unfortunately I have to say yes, because even among the persons arrested there were foreigners.  So they had not taken time to check all the information concerning these persons, yes.  Thank you.  
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Renzaho, the question that the President's asking you:  So, in that commission, apart from the public prosecutor, who is the highest magistrate of the country, were there judges in that sorting committee, as far as you know?  
A.	Counsel, I have not looked completely through the list, but I think I saw the name of a certain Mr. Vianney, but I think he was a worker in the court of first instance in Kigali.  But I believe there were persons appointed by the prime minister.  I would not be surprised that some persons were taken from the court of first instance.  Vianney, I believe, worked at the court of first instance in Kigali.  Vianney Hebiyembere, he appears on the list.  He was appointed to the Kigali court of first instance.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please slow down.  

Now, this name, do we find that between the 12?  

How do you spell it?  Please do.  
THE WITNESS: 
Readily, sir.  H-E-B-I-Y-E-M-B-E-R-E, Vianney.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is it number 7, Antoine?  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, we -- we find that name on number 7 of the document, but the first name is Antoine.  
A.	That is possible.  
Q.	But on the document his function is director general of the justice administration.  
A.	However, I knew him to be working at the Kigali court of first instance.  I don't know.  
Q.	Well, then, Mr. Renzaho, I would rephrase my question, because you may have forgotten a while ago.  The question was:  What was the number of the persons you administered when you took over office in the year that followed, that is, the population of Kigali city?  
A.	Thank you for your question.  I am obliged to -- to say this maybe with reference to the census that was conducted in Kigali and throughout the country in 1991, and a report came out in 1994.  So I will give you the overall figure, because the report is -- is very voluminous, so I did not calculate everything with any great precision.  So, generally speaking, the population of Kigali, including foreigners and everybody, was 233,000 in April 1994.  And within that figure, because this is the Rwandan scourge, people were identified by the ethnic groups and so on.  And the Tutsis were 38,910 in Kigali.  And the number of foreigners is there; I believe the document is available.  And so there you have the figures for 1994.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Renzaho, you mentioned the population census of 15 August 1991, but that was made public only in April 1994.  Is that the document, Mr. Renzaho, the document I'm holding up?  
A.	That should be the document, but it was not drawn up on the date you mentioned.  It was a process that went up to 1994, because the proceedings went on at the administrative block of the Kigali préfecture. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, this document is found on the third list of our -- of our folder.  I don't have the number right away.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Number 16.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, let us now go back to your duties as préfet.  After your appointment and the assumption of office, what, in a nutshell, were the main duties that you were expected to carry out?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I would not like to repeat myself.  I believe the priority duties was to set in motion the organs of the préfecture.  Then the -- the thorny issue at the time was the security problem.  So there was daily insecurity in the city of Kigali, and we were experiencing a rather deadly urban guerrilla attack in public places, in leisure areas, in buses, in taxis -- 
Q.	Sorry to cut you short, but I think we will come back to that context by and by.  But the main duties that you performed shortly after your appointment -- because a while ago you mentioned the setting up of the two main committees that govern the city, and you were the executive organ.  So, now, a question on the context:  In what political context did these actions that you mentioned take place?  
A.	Thank you.  The political context was difficult -- a very difficult one because we had a war situation, and the democratic opening up that was happening at the same time.  That was a decision of the powers that were at the time.  So it was difficult to grant democratic freedoms at a time when guerrilla attacks imposed restrictions on such freedoms.  I am talking about control of the population -- measures to control the population that raised a controversy within the population because political parties did not take it well.  But we had to tread a fine line between the two situations:  War and security, and democratic freedoms.  So it's a difficult situation that I may develop further.  

But, as counsel has just asked me, the context was also characterised by a very difficult economic situation.  Rwanda was attacked at the time -- when it had just been imposed structural adjustment measures, and then the war broke out, closing off the northern corridor.  That was the fastest and the most (unintelligible) to merchandise coming from abroad into Rwanda or from Rwanda going outside.  So the country's economic situation was very difficult.  And for Kigali in particular, this city is supplied by other préfectures that bring in food items to Kigali.  So the war prevented much of these products from coming into Kigali.  And restrictions, roadblocks were imposed on some of these préfectures and they delayed the transportation of products and goods.  

And that situation also prevailed in some kind of competition, as I told you.  When the préfet took up office he had to cope with demonstrations of the youth, of political parties, rather turbulent demands, and one had to cope with all of this and at the same time create safety valves or outlets for people to make their -- hold their rallies and so on.  So the context was really difficult.  But I don't know if there are other aspects that you would like me to mention.  
Q.	Thank you.  I will ask you the appropriate questions, Mr. Renzaho.  Now, on the context that you've just described, the political context as well as the economic context, can you mention passive or active measures that you had to take to cope with the situation?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  The guerrilla warfare in the city of Kigali was very, very dangerous and harmful.  At the time the city was not very large, and schools, transportation -- collective transportation systems were threatened, as well as markets, and one could not find enough soldiers to protect all the areas that had to be protected.  And I believe that the passive measures that involved the contribution of the population to protect specific sites, persons who were well informed of the danger could significantly contribute to improving the situation.  So we carried out educational charts, or sessions, to inform the population of the nature of the conflict that had been imposed, and the ways and means by which they could help protect filling stations, road vehicles, ways of how they could identify a mine by looking at a fresh mound of earth anywhere, raise awareness among students on how they played in school.  Because there were grenades that were stuck in schools, entrances into schools, and these things were there, the children they don't know them, and they got themselves killed.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Maître Cantier, it is certainly always important to view things in context, but I wonder whether you will assist us so that we'll only get what is needed legally?  Sometimes there are some details coming up that you may not wish to use in your closing arguments.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, you are perfectly right.  These are points related to the context, and they are meant to help the Chamber to come to terms with the environment in which Mr. Renzaho worked, and in which, generally speaking, the political and military situation in Rwanda took place.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	So, Mr. Renzaho, you've heard the President's clarification on those passive and active measures.  Please cite them and try to be brief and illustrate your attitude, your action, and your work in the face of that situation.  
A.	Thank you.  Under passive measures you have education, public awareness, possibly training on what the population had to do.  And active measures came in during the major crisis we had in Kigali, and we had them, you know, during violent demonstrations, assassinations.  And these measures comprised of curfews -- 
Q.	Well, this would come in with more specific questions, so please try to be concise.  Yes, Mr. Renzaho, to illustrate that situation and the political context, I will give you this document titled "Report on the attitude of youth movements of parties in Kacyiru commune, Kicukiro, Nyarugenge, and Kanombe".  It is a report that was commissioned by the authorities, and is dated 16 December 1992.  Mr. Renzaho, do you know this document?  
A.	Yes, Counsel, I know -- I know it.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, it is found on our third list, I think, it is number 6 or something.  The sixth document.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Renzaho, precisely, on page 12 of this document -- well, we found only the French version of this document.  

"The préfets regularly held security council meetings to decide on the appropriate measures to take.  They also organised meetings with the population in areas of attacks."  

Are these the measures that you mentioned a while ago?  
A.	Precisely, these are pacification measures only.  But I added others under prevention, through public awareness campaigns on the new situation, because Rwanda had never been accustomed to the explosion of minds.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, still in a bid to illustrate the situation, and more directly, your attitude in the face of that situation, do you recall the letter that you wrote to the secretary general of the central intelligence service in Kigali on 7 November 1991?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, it's in our folder, Defence folder volume 1, exhibit (sic) number 5.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, do you have any recollection of that document? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	I may read out to you the first paragraph, and you would tell me if you confirm that it is what you wrote at the time:  

"I have the honour to report to you that I have received information to the effect that there is interethnic conflict in Kibungo (sic), Kanombe, and Kibukeru (phonetic), and these tensions" --  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Remember to read slowly. 

Let's start again.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	"I have the honour to report to you that I have received information to the effect that there is interethnic tension in Rubungo, Kanombe, and even Kicukiro communes.  And this tension is the outcome of the dissemination of tracts inciting persons to carry out interethnic massacres."  

So, do you recall that paragraph, Mr. Renzaho?  
A.	Yes, Counsel, I do acknowledge it.  
Q.	And what precisely did you want to point out, and what kind of answer did you expect to your request?  
A.	I wanted to report that tension was building within the population, and was caused by extremist elements who were found everywhere.  You always find extremist elements.  And with the progress of the war, these elements seemed to be justified.  So the state services had to face the problem head-on and try to identify such persons, and seek to neutralise them, because I considered it a danger.  At the time when we were prosecuting the war, we should not start another war within the country.  So that was the problem.  

And you realise that the letter was addressed to the central intelligence service, and with the creation of the post of prime minister, the central intelligence service was headed directly by the prime minister.  So he was going to know about this, or at least the government was going to know about this, following the change in constitution in 1991.  Thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, do you recall a letter that you sent this time to your minister, the minister of the interior and rural development, on 15 November 1991?  
A.	Yes, I sent reports regularly.  So maybe if you can read a few passages of it, then I would know.  But I generally sent reports on the situation.  
Q.	I'm going to read out a passage to you:  

"The préfecture is also fighting against these crimes -- this criminal -- or the thieving actions by carrying out police patrols."  And I will cite the main passages.  "The resources of the police are highly limited, and therefore we count above all on the gendarmes."  

On that score, Mr. Renzaho, there's a question I've not asked you which stems from this document.  What was the staff strength of the communal police?  A while ago you mentioned that when you took up office, there were about 25 communal police in Nyarugenge commune, I believe.  So did you add to that number of the communal police, and so what was the total number of the communal police in September or November 1991?  
A.	Thank you very much.  We developed a police unit given the missions that had been entrusted to us, and the police staff strength, even unarmed as they were, was 250 persons.  Unfortunately, part of them were armed and another part was not armed because we did not have the necessary resources to provide them with arms.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The letter you are referring to now, dated 15th November 1991, is that a document which is also in Defence folder volume 1?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President.  Volume 1, number 6.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, still on your concerns at that period, do you recall a letter that you sent, this time to the minister of national defence, 23 September 1991?  
A.	Yes, Counsel, I do recall.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, it's in the Defence documents volume 1, document number 4.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	I will read out the first sentence of that document to you.  And you say:  "I have the honour to report to you the alarming security situation of the préfecture of Kigali city."  

So what exactly did you want to report to the minister of national defence through that letter?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  What I wanted to bring to his attention was a very serious situation of generalised insecurity.  At a time when we were experiencing a war situation, we equally had elements, be they soldiers or gendarmes, who were carrying out acts of banditry within the population.  And I would like to say that it was rather regrettable, and it justified the preparation of the country for the war that was imposed on it in 1990.  Because these elements were the direct outcome of the massive recruitments that followed the FP -- RPF aggression.  

So the Rwandan army moved from a low number of 6,000 men to over 25,000 in a very short while.  And you will agree with me that the speed of recruitment and training was not enough to -- to give the soldiers the required experience, notably with regard to military regulations that each soldier was supposed to know, and to implement with regard to his attitude as a soldier.  So it was seen through a lot of indiscipline.  These people sometimes deserted their positions, and they came to swell the ranks of bandits in this city -- in the capital city.  So I called on the minister of defence to intervene and to help combat strongly these elements who disrupted public peace.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Would this be a good moment for the 11 o'clock break?  We will then resume at 11:25.  Court is adjourned.  
(Court recessed from 1103H to 1129H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Maître Cantier.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, did you hear about a document called "Note on the evolution of multiparty democracy in Rwanda"?  
A.	Yes, Counsel, I read the document. 
MR. CANTIER: 
I am going to ask, forthwith, the booth to refer to a passage, because in the document which we have, Mr. President, Your Honours, the Defence list number 29 (sic), the text I wish for Mr. Renzaho to listen to is only available in Kinyarwanda.  Part of the document is in French, and the other part is in Kinyarwanda.  So I would ask -- like to ask the booth to read out the short excerpt and translate it to us, and then I shall put a question to Mr. Renzaho subsequently.  I distributed the document.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Exactly which document are you now referring to?  We have what we got this morning and an electronic copy, and we have a document which is called "outgoing code cable" which we just found on our desk.  
MR. CANTIER: 
No, Mr. President, that is not the document I'm referring to.  The document I just mentioned is entitled, in French, "Note on the development of multiparty democracy in Rwanda", and it can be found on the third list under number 29 (sic).  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But, you see, when you say "the third list" we think that you are referring to the list which is running from number 1 to number 21.  And that's why we don't understand why you are referring to number 29.  
MR. CANTIER: 
My apologies, Mr. President.  When I put my glasses correctly I do see that it is number 21.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right, the last document in what we received this morning.  And it's true that it's only in Kinyarwanda.  

Mr. Moses.  
MR. MOSES: 
Yes, sorry, Your Honour, I'm just wondering before -- or, if the Accused is going to make reference to it, whether we can have some greater foundation for what this document is?  I, unfortunately, do not read Kinyarwandan.  I only have from page -- we're only disclosed, I believe, from page 10 onwards.  So it's very unclear who made the document, it's not signed, and it's in a language which -- which is a different issue, but I'm just asking that there be some foundation laid before questions are asked.  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Why don't you start explaining this, Maître Cantier?  It seems to start with K number K0504232.  On the top of that page, the internal pagination is 9.  What kind of document is this?  Where does it come from?  We have noted the title of the document, as you have summarised it under number 21, but what kind of note, written by whom?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, this is a document which we discovered in the databank of the Prosecution, and the document which we have is not signed.  The title is the one I provided previously, and as it indicates, the purpose of this document is to give some idea to the reader on the developments in multiparty democracy in Rwanda during the -- during two years -- the two years from 1992 to 1994, and it -- it is this part in Kinyarwanda that deals with that matter.  And we deemed it interesting in order to give an idea of the situation that prevailed in Rwanda, especially with regard to public order.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And now you said that it covered 1992 to '94, whereas the title you have written indicates the period '90 to '91.  But, leaving that aside, who wrote this?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, all I can say is that this document is in the Prosecution database, and I do not know much more about it.  Since this document seemed to us to be comprehensive and objective -- it is not a propaganda document -- we thought it might be interesting to make use of it.  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, the Prosecution's submission is that what is of interest to Your Honour is what the Accused has to say, and not what any other person who is unknown and unnamed might have said.  It is -- it doesn't prevent my learned friend from putting a proposition to this witness and asking for his comment on it, which might be a way in which -- but I would be objecting to the document being used in the way in which my learned friend is proposing to use it.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I think we would prefer avoiding reading this document, even if it may come from a good source and be interesting.  You probably have a plan, and the reason why you want to put this to the Accused is that you want to solicit information from him.  He may, for instance, agree with some of the propositions in the text.  Maybe instead of going the cumbersome way through reading this unknown document, that you could just ask questions to the Accused.  
MR. CANTIER: 
I can proceed in that manner, but what I was proposing was quite similar to what was proposed by my learned friend.  I wished to briefly read an excerpt and then put a question to the witness.  But then I can go straight to the question.  

BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, in this document, reference is made to demonstrations by MRND and CDR in order to protest against the Arusha Accords, and such demonstrations blocked roads.  Do you confirm that such events took place, especially in Kigali town, since you were its préfet?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, and everyone must remember to speak slowly.  Everyone.  

Now it's your turn, Mr. Renzaho.  
THE WITNESS: 
I'm much obliged, Mr. President.  

The demonstration which is referred to, if my memory serves me well, took place in early 1993.  And unless I'm mistaken, there were, at the time, negotiations on the sharing of power.  And the demonstrations did indeed take place, not in town, but rather in an area of Kigali-rural, and more specifically in the commune of Butamwa on the Giticyinyoni-Rwada (phonetic) road.  That was where the demonstration took place.  I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the location was -- shall we make sure that we have the spelling?  
THE WITNESS: 
I referred to the commune of Butamwa.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's fine.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, these demonstrations you were faced with, were they violent in nature?  Were there armed people who participated in the demonstrations and who perpetrated serious acts?  
A.	Counsel, I do not know whether you are referring to the demonstration we were talking about earlier on.  
Q.	No, Mr. Renzaho, I am referring to other demonstrations that might have involved people who were armed and who perpetrated serious acts.  That is my precise question.  
A.	Thank you very much, Counsel.  Yes, indeed, I was faced with violent demonstrations during which people were armed with clubs, with studded clubs, or knives, and where people had tools in order to puncture vehicle tyres.  When such demonstrations took place, the sole purpose was to perpetrate acts of violence throughout the town, including the breaking into shops and thefts.  So I do state that I was indeed faced with such violent demonstrations.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
In the -- in the answer you just gave you said that you were faced with violent demonstrations three times.  The question was precise; why don't you content yourself only by saying it once, and very briefly?  Here comes the next question.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Renzaho, I was putting the specific question to you, because in the correspondence I mentioned earlier on, dated 7th of November of 1999, which is in our binder, volume 1, number 5, there is a third paragraph that I wish to read out to you, and I will subsequently ask you whether you confirm what you denounced in that correspondence.  You are stating, and I quote:  

"These youths are allegedly armed with machetes.  Their intention would be to burn out -- burn down houses and kill people, and they even supposedly have fuel in order to carry out that task.  One house has been burnt down in the secteur already.  That house belonged to Mrs. Muhimpundu, of Tutsi ethnicity, in the same Ndera secteur."  

Do you confirm the event you denounced to the secretary general of the central intelligence service?  
A.	Yes, Counsel, I confirm the information. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This was probably number 304.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, my apologies regarding the names.  Indeed, the name of the individual who was the victim is indeed found under 304.  And the Ndera secteur is not on my list, and it's spelt N-D-E-R-A.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, throughout that period, what links did you have with political parties and their youth wings?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Regarding my links with political parties and the organisations, I had some relations with them within the framework of the relations the administration was to have with groups that were within the préfecture and who were exercising their rights under any free democratic system.  So that -- those were the links I had with such groups.  And perhaps I can explain further regarding the exercise of democratic freedoms, that there was a law on demonstrations, and that is the link between the administration and political parties.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you, after becoming prefect, join any political party?  Yes or no?  
THE WITNESS: 
No.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The description you just gave, does that mean that your links with the political parties were then of a professional character in connection with your duties as the prefect?  Is that your evidence?  
THE WITNESS: 
That is what I just stated, Your Honours.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho -- and perhaps your answer will complement the first question posed by the President in an indirect manner.  After your appointment, did you maintain any specific links with the military institution -- with the army?  
A.	No, I had no military function.  I did not have any specific military activity, but my name was still on the list of those who were paid by the army every month.  That's it.  Thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, does that mean, since you were still within the army, you were still bound by the rules of the army, that is to say, you were to be neutral and you were prohibited from belonging to any political party?  
A.	Counsel, what you are saying is true.  I entirely agree with you.  Because of my status as a member of the army, it was prohibited for me to be a member of any political party.  
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Renzaho, what was the specific role of PVK, and more specifically, your role in view of the destabilisation actions carried out in Kigali?  And I would like you to only focus on the issue of the attacks and the political assassinations, since we have already dealt with all the issues related to the enforcement of law and order in general.  
A.	The Kigali town préfecture was a prime target during the revolutionary war that was waged against us.  The aspects you are underscoring, that is to say, attacks and political assassinations, indeed took place.  In Kigali, there were violent attacks using explosives or mines, or very sophisticated tools that I saw for the first time when those events took place.  These attacks took place at the Kigali station, at the junction in Nyakabanda, also in Kigali.  Some buildings were burnt, a bomb exploded at the Kigali post office, at the bar called Kigali Nightclub there was also a bomb that exploded, and so on and so forth.  So these were events that indeed took place.  And I cannot list all the cases which we recorded.  

Regarding political assassinations, that is also true that they took place.  First of all there were some cases where we would find people dead on the street and we did not know how such deaths had occurred.  But the most flagrant cases were witnessed in Kigali town, the assassination of Gapyisi, Emmanuel, which proved -- and it was proven that the same people who perpetrated that act wanted to also kill the members of his association, which was called (French spoken), peace and democracy, which published a newspaper.  There was also an attack in Ndera and another of his associates was also attacked.  Subsequently there was the case of Gishushu where I personally intervened in order to calm down people.  Four persons were killed by APR members who had come out of their base at the CND.  And when they were leaving, they abducted people that they took back with them to their base in CND.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, let me interrupt you just for a moment in order to give the Trial Chamber and the staff the names you have just referred to.  Gapyisi, Emmanuel, is number 109 on the spelling list.  

And the second name you mentioned -- 
A.	The second name is Bonameka (phonetic). 
Q.	You said Gishushu.  
A.	Gishushu is the village which faces the CND. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
One hundred and thirty-four.  

Now, which periods are we referring to now?  Attacks and political assassinations started from when?  Just give me a time frame, very briefly.  
THE WITNESS: 
In December of 1990.  And these acts were perpetrated throughout the war.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, are you aware of a document entitled "Study on terrorism in Rwanda since 1990", which was produced by the national gendarmerie in Rwanda?  
A.	Counsel, before I answer your question, I do not know whether I answered your question or whether what I said on the matter was sufficient.  
Q.	I shall come back to the matter subsequently; have no fear, Mr. Renzaho.  Now, I am referring to a document which is on the third Defence list under number 12.  
A.	Counsel, I have read that document you're referring to.  
Q.	Very well.  Let me remind you -- 
MR. MOSES: 
The document which was provided to us on Friday appears to be from an annex to a book written by Mr. Lugan.  Once again, I don't know exactly who wrote it and when, and it doesn't -- and it's only in French, and I stand corrected, but it's not readily apparent who compiled this document and what period it is covering.  And I don't know if my learned friend can assist us before he starts referring the witness to the document.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Well, I believe that it was the first attack of my learned colleague on Professor Lugan.  In order to continue with that attack, one will have to wait until next week.  But the document is indeed mentioned by Professor Lugan, annex 1 of his book, "Rwanda, enquiry on the genocide."  This document which is mentioned in the annex does indeed refer to the Rwandan republic national gendarmerie criminal research and documentation centre in Kigali.  It bears the title "Study on terrorism in Rwanda since 1990".  According to Professor Lugan, it dates back to June of 1993, and the date, Mr. President, Your Honours, seems to be confirmed through the examples provided in the report on page 584, since he refers to events that go up to May of 1993.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you need additional information, Mr. Moses, or do you have any comments?  

Is this the complete report of June '93, or is it an excerpt?  Is this what we find as the complete annex in Lugan's book?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President.  Since we did not merely target the city of Kigali, this report covers the whole of Rwanda, and it is the entire annex to the book.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  What is your first question?  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, this report mentions a number of attacks, and I'm going to mention only those that took place in Kigali.  Moreover, you've mentioned some of them yourself.  So still on page 584 -- I am sorry that there is only the French version, we found it only in French.  This page gives examples of the attacks in Kigali, that is, this one in Kigali bus station; 2 June 1992, Petrorwanda; 22 April 1993, the central post office in Kigali.  Mr. Renzaho, do you confirm these incidents and the dates?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You see, the problem now is that this annex only has one page number, and that is page 279.  We find that on the bottom of the first page.  But in the photocopies we have received, there are no other page numbers.  Well, one would assume, then, that page 280 is the one on the left-hand side following, et cetera.  But it's not so easy to find out exactly where you are.  Can you tell us what the title is on the pages you are referring to now, so that we can identify that page with certainty?  
MR. CANTIER: 
I apologise for the complications, Mr. President.  Maybe not the page, but the numbers, because they follow.  I mention this because under number 41, under the title "Relations between the attacks and attacks committed with the use of explosives", that's number 41.  And effectively you won't find the page numbers in this photocopy, but you will realise that our document is complete because after 41 there you find 42.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's fine.  And are you now under iv, and you started with number 41, and then are referring to number 42, and you want Mr. Renzaho's comments on any of these two attacks?  
MR. CANTIER: 
No, Mr. President.  Under 41 I limited myself to examples of attacks cited in this report:  Butare, Kibungo.  But I restricted myself to those that occurred in Kigali.  You have the list there before you.  So you have the third one there, 19 March 1992, Kigali bus station; 25 April 1992, bus station, Kigali; 2nd June 1992, Petrorwanda Kigali -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down.  All right.  So it's on the following page under "examples".  It's noted.  Yes.  We now have this list of examples in front of us, and you want a comment from Mr. Renzaho?  
MR. CANTIER: 
It's already been done, Mr. President.  I asked him if he confirmed the dates and the places of those attacks, and he answered in the affirmative.  
THE WITNESS: 
That is correct.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Still in that document, under chapter 8, entitled "masterminds" or "commanditaries", in French, it is written, and I quote:  "We can affirm that the mastermind of most of these attacks is the RPF."  Mr. Renzaho, what is your comment on that observation? 
A.	I do confirm what is written here, and I say so with full knowledge of the facts, because I know that from the outbreak of the various incidents, a committee of experts was appointed to assist the gendarmerie service in charge of criminal matters to conduct the investigation.  And each time the result was that the incidents were committed by agents of the RPF.  The last incident was the one that happened in Cyangugu préfecture, where young persons were arrested in the heat of the action and they confessed.  That is what I had to say, thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, a while ago you mentioned assassinations.  Do you recall that of Mr. Gatabazi?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I was not in the country at the time of the assassination.  I was informed while I was abroad by the organisers of the seminar that I was attending.  And I was -- I was shocked because I was told that, at the time I was receiving the information, the city of Kigali was on fire.  That was the -- the hard information I got.  So I received that information, and I was given the secretary there that had a telephone, and I contacted those I could contact in Kigali, and the information was confirmed, as well as the measures that were taken.  That reassured me a bit, and I stayed on.  That is how I learnt of it.  And when I returned home, I found the city of Kigali under a curfew.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I'm going to -- to read out a paragraph from Mr. Ruzibiza's book.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, it's in our folder on the third list, number 9.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Moses?  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, I've had the opportunity to look at the proposed documents, and can I just make a general comment, because I don't want to be having to repeat:  I'm not going to be objecting to any official documents, I'm not going to be objecting to any UNAMIR SITREP reports, I'm not going to be referring to -- objecting to such documents.  But to try and get in through the back door, as it were, comments by a disaffected person who hasn't testified in this trial through -- by means of a passage from his book, in my submission falls within a category of document that should not be referred to in this manner and which is a back door way of trying to enter -- enter it into evidence.  

I've had the opportunity, Your Honours, of reading Trial Chamber I's decision on the Nsengiyumva motion to admit documents as exhibits from the Military I trial, where a similar approach was taken in respect of statements.  And the Trial Chamber made it quite clear that there were appropriate ways in which documents could be put to witnesses in cross-examination, but that it was not to circumvent Rule 92 bis, or -- which, in my submission, this is potentially -- this isn't to do with background information, it's to do with matters which are in contest -- which we do contest.  So, can I indicate that this is one of the documents that I will be opposing being referred to or introduced.  Thank you, Your Honours.  
(Pages 19 to 36 by Kirstin McLean)



























1215H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maître Cantier?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I don't see any clear reason from the legal standpoint for any objection to this reading out of comments or to the tendering of this document.  The Prosecutor would recall the position that Mr. Renzaho occupied, and it is on that basis that he has built his charge, the charge brought against Renzaho, and that position had to do with the maintenance of law, order, and security in the city of Kigali.  

Indisputably, the attacks and the killings were major disruptions of public peace.  I will read out an excerpt from a book, which is a general analysis, and hear the specific case of the assassination of Mr. Gatabazi.  I don't see how this document cannot be used by the Defence for the defence of Mr. Renzaho.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which page?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Page 225, and I would merely put the first paragraph to Mr. Renzaho, and it has to do with Mr. Gatabazi.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
About rumours?  That's the one?  
MR. CANTIER: 
That is how the sentence begins, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The witness has expressed a view as to who was behind certain attacks.  That view seems to be the foundation for why he wants to draw our attention of a statement in a book which is a public document accessible to everyone.  

The Nsengiyumva decision was a bit different in various respects, so we will allow you to go ahead with this sequence, Maître Cantier.  Please proceed.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, I will move on by reading out the paragraph to you, by asking you a number of questions.  

"Rumours were spread to the effect that Gatabazi had been assassinated by the Impuzamugambi youth of the CDR, because he was one of the opposition leaders who were opposed to President Juvénal Habyarimana.  But, as I have said before, he was assassinated by the RPF.  And he was not the only one on the list of persons who were going to be killed."

Mr. Renzaho, what is your comment on that analysis of Mr. Abdul Ruzibiza? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I believe that analysis is correct and real.  I would like to say that terrorist acts were committed by the RPF agents on the ground, and the trick they used was to try and turn away responsibility for these crimes to some other persons.  Well, strictly speaking, in 1993-1994, at the time Gatabazi died, there was no longer a Habyarimana regime.  

So, the ten days before the RPF infiltrated persons to commit crimes, and then used their relays to spread the information that the crime was committed by the regime was a frequent one.  So, at the time when Gatabazi died, it was rumoured that Gatabazi had been killed by the agents of the president, who considered him a personal enemy, as they claimed.  

And we had occasion to observe this situation well before.  The mix-up of war and multiparty politics only led to a situation of misinformation, subversion, and destabilisation that led to the lawlessness that we witnessed in April 1994.  And maybe it was part of the strategy that was designed beforehand to take over power.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please try to be briefer.  

Here follows the next question.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, did you personally participate in the negotiations that led to the Arusha Accords?  Please answer by yes or no to speed up proceedings.  
A.	Thank you.  I forgot to apologise.  I really want to make an effort.  

No, I did not participate.  
Q.	And concerning the KWSA negotiations, did you play any role in the negotiations and conclusion of that accord? 
A.	No, I was not involved in the negotiation of that accord. 
Q.	Witness, concerning the Arusha Accord -- well, at least with respect to the aspects dealing with the law and order and security in Kigali? 
A.	Yes, the aspect that had to do with UNAMIR.  The overall mission of UNAMIR falls within the -- that peace accord.  Thank you.  
Q.	Witness, with respect to the KWSA accord, did it also have provisions that targeted the city of Kigali and the security situation in the city of Kigali? 
A.	Yes, the KWSA accord had to do with the security of the city of Kigali which fell within the security perimeter defined by the same KWSA accord. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I am going to read out to you point number 5 of the KWSA accord.  
MR. CANTIER: 
And, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a document in addition to the Arusha Accord, a document that has already been tendered in evidence, D. 36; D. 36, the KWSA accord, points 4 and 5 of the KWSA.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	I am going to read them out and then put them to your position (sic).  

"Point 4:  The commander of the Kigali secteur is responsible for the setting up of the weapons safety zone of weapons in Kigali in collaboration with the national gendarmerie and the local police.  

"Point number 5:  The infantry battalions and UN observers deployed all over Kigali will provide the personnel and assume control of the weapons safety area."  

Mr. Renzaho, were you aware of these provisions, and how did you interpret them? 
A.	Yes, I was aware of them.  I interpreted them as an exceptional situation for the city of Kigali, which under that period was placed under the occupation of UNAMIR forces.  

And with particular regard to the involvement of the police, I would like to tell the Chamber that the police did not play any role in the activities that were planned by UNAMIR officials, and any request for the training of staff between UNAMIR and the préfecture did not yield any positive result.  So the police is cited in there, but it was never involved in the security mechanism for the city of Kigali.  Thank you.  
Q.	Witness, can you tell the Trial Chamber about the origins of civil defence and also tell the Trial Chamber what you know about the setting up of this mechanism? 
A.	Counsel, let me tell you, as regards the origins of civil defence, that once again it was all due to the war, the war and the way it was waged.  It was a revolutionary war which made use of all the tricks that would enable one to reach one's targets.  Concretely, in the field, there were, in fact, incursions and also actions aimed at circumventing the Rwandan armed forces operations conducted by the RPF, which was using methods whereby people would disguise as ordinary citizens with a lot of clothes that they could change in or out of quite rapidly, and they would infiltrate the population, and they would perpetrate atrocities; people were killed, other people fled, and when they so wished they would abduct people, because as I stated previously the country was surprised by the attack, and we did not have an army or sufficient soldiers to cover the whole border in order to be able to organise surveillance of the border.  It was not possible, so there were spaces that were not covered by the surveillance, and the attackers had probably, through reconnaissance work, seen which locations they could infiltrate the country from.  

So we were surprised by these attacks which created a lot of damage within the population and it was not possible for us to intervene.  And for that reason, it was absolutely necessary to involve the population, for them, at least, to mention to us the arrival of these fighters so that the intervention forces could come and assist the population.  So those were the objectives of the civil defence mechanism.  The populations were asked to participate in their own defence.  I do not know whether I answered your question, and I thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, yes, you answered the question, but can you tell us in what part of the country the civil defence system or mechanism appeared at the beginning? 
A.	Counsel, it was set up in the northeastern part of the country and in the northern part of the country, which were those regions that were attacked first by the APR troops.  I thank you.
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, you do know that the Prosecution has charged you with having been the leader of civil defence in Kigali and in PVK and, consequently, has charged you with being responsible for the killings that were perpetrated by the civil defence forces.  Could you tell the Trial Chamber what specific role you played in the organisation and the operation of civil defence in Kigali?  And, perhaps, before you do that, you should tell the Trial Chamber what were the governmental decisions that were adopted regarding civil defence?  
A.	Counsel, I might disappoint you if I tell you that I played no part whatsoever in the organisation of civil defence and that civil defence was never implemented in Kigali.  

As for the second part of your question on the decisions adopted by the government, I only know of one which came along with the guidelines by the prime minister dated 25th of May 1994.  And in Kigali we were -- we almost had no resources left, and I do not know whether one can indeed talk about civil defence under such circumstances.  If I may be given some time, perhaps I can be more explicit.  
Q.	Yes, Mr. Renzaho, I believe that is the wish of the Trial Chamber, since this is one of the main charges brought against you.  And in order to orient you somewhat in your answers, at least as regards the format of your answer, you do know that there had been an exchange of correspondence between yourself and the ministry of defence on the 30th and 31st of March 1994 dealing with this very issue.  Could you please explain to the Trial Chamber the reason for this exchange of correspondence and also the effective role you played in the setting up of civil defence? 
A.	I thank you, Counsel.  I wish to state that from January of 1994 the situation in Kigali was such that we were expecting the war to break out in Kigali.  And I can tell you that there were rumours that started as early as January of 1994 whereby the RPF was ready to stage a coup in Kigali.  And some explosions, the bombings that were not fully understood at the time, especially the bombing we referred to when we talked about Gatabazi's death, can be explained by the fear within the population that violence was going to break out in Kigali when most Rwandans, not all of them, but most Rwandans were in fact operating in a context of peace within the framework of the Arusha Accords.  This to say that evidence was -- intelligence was being received and the chief of staff, who was the head of the unit, probably -- was probably thinking of what would have to be done if the war was to break out in Kigali. 

I attended a meeting during which he took stock of the situation and his main concern was the system of alert for all the soldiers who were spread out in the different neighbourhoods and who could be -- or could have problems grouping and joining the rest of the forces.  So this was the starting point for this idea, and he believed that the soldiers were not the only ones to be concerned by this matter.  

There was also the issue of the protection of populations if fighting was to break out in this large city that is Kigali.  What was to be done?  It was clear that there were three armies on the site, that there were strategic positions that were occupied by the UNAMIR forces, and that it was not possible to base one's activities on assumptions whereby some of the positions would be lost or not.  And for all those reasons, it was thought that the matter was to be looked at in a comprehensive manner.  I attended the meeting and I was asked to provide lists of the staff members who were to undergo training and to be used within the framework of this civil defence mechanism.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Renzaho, the letters you have referred to are the letters you sent on the 31st of March of 1994 with a list of people to the ministry of defence?  
A.	Yes, indeed, Counsel.  I provided the lists, but there was no action carried out in order to implement these ideas.  There were decisions of the government which were to be made following the action undertaken in order to finalise the programme of civil defence on the 6th of April 1994.  There was the attack that did not enable us to do anything, because on that date we did not have any civil defence system implemented in Kigali.  So that is what I wish to explain.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The meeting took place, when?  
THE WITNESS:
I do not recall the date, but it was towards the end of the month of March on the 28th or -- 
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, in the letter of the 30th of March reference is made to the said meeting.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, you have just stated that a civil defence system was to be set up, but in view of the events this mechanism was never implemented.  So how do you explain the presence of Major Bivamvagara at the PVK?  And, perhaps, before you do that, you could tell us when that person arrived there and what was his mission?  
A.	Counsel, thank you.  I might once again imitate some people, because what I have been able to hear here is in contradiction with what I am about to tell you.  Bivamvagara was a reservist.  He was a reserve officer, and the act calling upon the reserve officers was signed by the minister of national defence on the 1st of May.  And if my memory serves me well, on the telegram referring to that matter, the name of that person is listed amongst the officers who were being called by the minister of national defence, in accordance with the provisions of the ministerial decree which dealt with the reserve officers of the Rwandan armed forces.  The persons listed were asked to state whether they were ready to serve the country, and if -- they were given four days to respond, which means that Bivamvagara came -- or went to the general staff in May at a date I am not aware of.  And since he could not find an office at the military Kigali camp, which had been shelled, and even the general staff headquarters had been destroyed, he was brought to me in order for me to provide him with office space at the préfecture, along with the team he came with.  So I gave him some office space at the préfecture.  So this is what I can say regarding Bivamvagara.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Renzaho, but you only responded to my question in part.  What was his mission, since the Prosecution claims that Mr. Bivamvagara was the person who came under your authority in order to set up the civil defence system at PVK?  So, can you please tell the Trial Chamber what was his role and what was his specific function?  
A.	Thank you very much, Counsel.  I believe it is a good thing that you remind me of that aspect.  Bivamvagara came not in -- not as someone who was seconded to the préfecture, but rather as an officer who was being entrusted missions by the general staff.  He came in order to recruit and train the fighters that the army required in order to fight on the front in Kigali.  

Perhaps I should say a few words on the situation prevailing in Kigali at the time, if I am allowed to do so; but if it is not necessary, I will not insist on that.  But I had no authority on Bivamvagara.  He did not come to work for the préfecture of Kigali.  
Q.	Later on we shall deal with the matters linked to the situation in Kigali town after the 6th of April 1994, Mr. Renzaho.  

Mr. Renzaho, still with regard to civil defence, and from what we have been able to read -- or what we have heard through testimony before this Trial Chamber, and I am referring more specifically to Mrs. Alison Des Forges -- this system, which was quite sophisticated, had provided for the setting up of a fund that was aimed at financing the civil defence activity.  So, my question, Mr. Renzaho, is whether you created such a fund at PVK and whether you received any funds from the government for the purpose of financing these activities, because it was necessary to feed, train, these people.  So this is my question, in two parts.
A.	I did not set up a fund at the préfecture in Kigali and I did not have the necessary resources to do so.  If I placed myself in the context prevailing at the time, it was virtually impossible to set up a fund because most people had fled the city, especially the traders; and all those who had things to protect had fled.  

The second question had to do with the uniforms, the food, and the training of these people.  If Bivamvagara came in order to recruit, train, soldiers in order to help the army fight on the front, it goes without saying that it was the army that was responsible for these people.  It was the army that took care of them.  I had no means in order to carry out such a task.  I thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, we are now going to move onto a different subject which will deal specifically with your life and your attitude from the 6th of April 1994 onwards.  And my first question regarding that date is:  Where were you in the afternoon of the 6th of April of 1994? 
A.	In the afternoon of the 6th of April of 1994, I was at the office.  I was in Kigali and I was in my office. 
Q.	Did you go back to your place of residence in Kanombe in the 6th of April in the evening?  And if your answer is in the affirmative, at what time, and how? 
A.	On the 6th of April of 1994, in the evening, I went back to my place of residence in Kanombe, and I used the Mazda double-cabin pickup truck of the urban development unit, because my own official vehicle had been sent to the garage during the morning of the 6th of April of 1994.  And I reached my home around 7:30 p.m. or thereabouts.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, since you referred to it, could you tell the Trial Chamber what was your usual official vehicle? 
A.	My official vehicle was a Renault 21, which was white in colour.  Thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, what did you do during the night from the 6th to the 7th of April of 1994? 
A.	I remember that upon arriving at my house I went to take a look at the work I had asked for on the right-hand side of the residence I lived in in Kanombe.  It was a separation wall which was to be built, because in that part there were reeds that had been eaten up by ants and I -- it was necessary to replace that part of the enclosure by a brick wall.  I noted that the work had not been done, so I went inside the house.  I spoke to the children who were doing their homework, and then we started eating; and towards the end of our meal we heard explosions, and we did not know what they were.  Insecurity started immediately because the second explosion was incredibly loud.  And immediately after that I heard gunshots which came from the lower part of the Kigali-Rwamaganda (phonetic) road, towards the camp.  

In order to give you some idea of the fear in which we were living, I immediately thought that we had come under attack.  And the intensity of the gunfire was increasing, so I requested the members of my family to switch the lights off, to close the windows, and to also hide in the corridor, because I had a house with a long corridor with the rooms upstairs and downstairs.  So that is where they hid.  And along with a policeman who was stationed at my house, he took the left -- or rather the left-hand side of the house, and I went to the right; and that is how we remained.  We waited.  But there was still gunfire, so we waited.  In that way there was insecurity.  

Increasingly, people were hiding out in the houses.  We couldn't see anyone moving about in the neighbourhood; and around 3 a.m. we noticed that the gunshots were -- seemed to come from further down and were going out of the neighbourhood.  And that was when I decided to go to Kanombe.  So those were the events as I lived them throughout that night.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, when did you hear about the death of the president?
A.	Counsel, I learned about the death of the president when I switched my radio on in the morning, around 6:30.  I switched the radio on and I heard classical music, which was unusual.  After sometime there was a communiqué from the ministry of national defence announcing the death of the president.  And that is how I heard that the president had died.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, there are two things that are quite surprising when one listens to your narration and on which I wish to put questions to you.  How come you did not listen to the radio?  Because, if you had listened to it, on the basis of what a number of witnesses told us, you would have heard about the death of the president.  So that is my first question.  

My second question is:  Why did you not try to reach your minister or any other official you were accountable to in order to try and determine what was happening?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  With regard to your first question, if I asked that the lights be switched off, I also asked that the radio be switched off.  These are security measures that come to me automatically under such circumstances.  I did not know who was behind the gunfire, and in that situation of fear we were in, I immediately thought we were coming under attack.  After having asked that the lights be switched off, I would not have switched on the radio.  

I don't know whether you have at any time gone around a house in the night and heard a radio on.  If a radio is on in a house, then it indicates that there are people who are there.  That is why I asked that everything be switched off in order for us to protect ourselves because I was fearing that we would be reached by any object that could have been thrown through our windows.  So that was the reason why I asked that everything be switched off.  

Now, regarding the second question, that is to say, why I did not call the minister of defence or the minister of the interior, or any other person, how could I have done that when I did not have a telephone?  I tried to say so under different circumstances and it appeared strange.  But, once again, I need to state that I did not have a telephone, and I could not go out of my place of residence because I was afraid because of the insecurity.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have to adjourn now to three o'clock.  
(Court recessed from 1304H to 1500H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon. 

Maître Cantier.
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, a while back you explained to us what you did in the night of the 6th to the 7th of April, and you told us that you thought it was a fresh military assault attack by the RPF.  Did you, sir, learn of a report, a KIBAT report, dated 21st January 1994?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, Exhibit 11 -- document number 11 in our third list.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Counsel, I did read that report.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	I will share with you the contents of the third paragraph of that document, and then I will put a question to you.  I will read:

"Rumours are abroad -- there are rumours in Kigali -- there are rumours in Kigali that the RPF has already arrived in town with 3,000 men, including the 300 -- no, 600 I think, officially ensconced in the CND.  In the north there are also 15,000 RPF troops waiting for a signal to launch a coup d'état from Kigali." 

My question, sir, is the following:  Were you aware of those rumours, and was it those rumours that led you to believe, in the night of the 6th to 7th of April, that it was an RPF attack? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I was aware of those rumours and practically everyone in Kigali, the entire population of Kigali, was aware of those rumours.  And things that arose in those days could but confirm those rumours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
A general remark:  The last question was leading, and there were quite a few also before the break.  So far, there have been no objections, and we have simply disregarded it.  But when we are coming to the core of the case, then it would be good if we would avoid it.  I am just stating this for the record so that the reader of transcripts later will not wonder why no one mentioned this.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President.  It's my legal tradition which leads me to be suggestive in my questioning, and sometimes I can be even worse.  I do beg your forgiveness.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, the Prosecution at first asserted that you were present at the meetings held at the chief of staff headquarters in the night of the 6th to the 7th of April.  Can you tell us why those assertions were jettisoned? 
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, I don't see how the -- one, it's no longer in the indictment, so it's not relevant.  Secondly, how can my learned friend ask the witness to comment on why the Prosecution may have amended the indictment?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the point you want to highlight, Maître?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I know that that charge was withdrawn; I have said so.  And I also know what Mr. Renzaho is charged with.  And in the indictment it states that he had authority over the armed forces, over the gendarmerie, and consequently that clarification as to what was decided at the outset seemed important to me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Renzaho, were you present at the chief of staff headquarters between the 6th and 7th of April?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, sir, no.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, this morning I think I asked you when you had learned of the death of the president, and you answered "At about 6:15 a.m., on the radio".  My question is the following, therefore, what did you then do? 
A.	Thank you for your question.  What was my reaction?  I was dumbfounded, and -- which was unusual for me -- I donned my military uniform.  I went out to seek information at Kanombe military camp, because I had no information. 
Q.	At what time did you arrive at Kanombe camp? 
A.	I left for Kanombe camp at about 7:00 and I think arrived at about ten past.  It didn't take long to get there.  
Q.	Could you tell us what is the distance between your house and Kanombe camp? 
A.	Kanombe military camp is about 600 metres from my residence. 
Q.	Who did you meet at Kanombe camp? 
A.	Thank you.  I saw and greeted the camp commander, Colonel Félicien Muberuka.  He was holding an officers' meeting and it was towards the end of the meeting.  
MR. CANTIER:
Muberuka is number 289 on the list of proper names.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, what, therefore, was the tenor of your conversation with Colonel Muberuka? 
A.	Thank you.  I was concerned as to what had happened during the night, and I was asking what happened during the night, and I was answered, I was given information regarding the attack.  I also asked whether what provisions were being made, disposition.  And that's when the camp commander invited me -- informed me that there had been a meeting at the chief of staff headquarters, and at that meeting the participants had agreed to inform the unit commanders, operational sector commanders, in addition to the officers who had taken part in the meeting.  I asked where the meeting was to be held, and I was told it would take place at the general staff headquarters.  That was the information given to me. 
Q.	At what time did you leave Kanombe camp and where did you go?  
A.	It was about 8:00-8:15.  I also asked the commander to lend me a vehicle to take me to Kigali because I had no vehicle.  And he gave me a jeep -- I think it was his own jeep -- and he detailed someone to accompany me.  It was his own jeep.  Because he was busy with other things, he asked the driver to take me and to come back as quickly as possible.  

So I exited with his vehicle, and when I got -- for those who know Kanombe, when I reached the military clinic, dispensary, I crossed the pickup that had -- I had ridden in the day before, and I signaled the driver to follow me.  So I went home with the jeep.  I took a few things.  I snatched up a few things quickly and started off for Kigali. 
Q.	And where did you head for?  Where did you go? 
A.	I went straight to my office at the Kigali-ville préfecture. 
Q.	And at what time do you estimate that you arrived at your office? 
A.	It must have been about 9:30, 9:40, 9:45, something like that.  
Q.	Whom did you find at the PVK when you arrived there? 
A.	At the PVK, well, there weren't many people, not as a usual working day, because the office was still closed, the curtains drawn.  I found the police on guard, as well as two people who'd fled to the préfecture.  And a bit later, I saw Major Nyamuhimba, the police commander.  Those were the people I saw at the préfectoral offices.  
Q.	You spoke of refugees.  Can you name them; some of them?  
A.	Well, I don't know.  If it doesn't threaten their security in any way, I can give their names.  The first person was Célestin Gahamanyi, director general of development at the ministry of the interior, who was a Tutsi.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the previous name was number 414 on the list.  Now, you have in the enumeration you just gave us, you mentioned one name.  Shall we take it number by number?  This first name, where do we find it, Maître Cantier?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Number 101, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And then the next you wanted to mention, Mr. Renzaho?  
THE WITNESS:
The other one was Mr. Ntawiha.  

MR. CANTIER: 
Number 402 on the list, Mr. President.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
In the morning on the 7th of April did you make any telephone calls?  
THE WITNESS:
Honourable Judge, thank you.  Yes, in passing at the small Akajagari trading centre, there was a shop -- a small shop with a telephone, and I borrowed the telephone.  I telephoned.  I merely wanted to contact the minister of the interior, but I didn't reach him. It didn't take long.  I couldn't get through and I went back by foot to the camp.  Yes, that's true.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, concerning those two people whom you have named, what did you do in their regard?  
A.	I felt that they were threatened, which is why they had left their homes to come to the préfecture, and I tried to talk with them to know exactly what sort of threat.  And they spoke of the gunfire they'd heard here and there throughout the night -- during the night, and they probably thought that some people were killed.  And I asked the policeman present to open, to take them inside and show them where they could rest.  In fact, there was a room very near the conference hall where they could rest.  That is what I did.  Thank you.  
Q.	With regard to the PVK staff, who was the first person you met? 
A.	I saw Major Nyamuhimba shortly after meeting the two people who had sought refuge at the préfecture.  And I needed to go into my office, and I asked the police to go and get my secretary so as to open the office.  It didn't take long.  He soon came and opened the office, and then I could ask -- I asked him to try and contact the bourgmestres to know what their situation was, and the heads of departments at the PVK, so as to know what their situation was. 
Q.	What was the name of your personal secretary -- personal assistant? 
A.	His name was Alfred Sibomana, number 532 -- Sibomana, Alfred. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
These two refugees, did you know their ethnicity?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  They were both Tutsi.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	On that morning of the 7th of April 1994, did you take part in a meeting?  
A.	Yes, it's true.  On the 7th in the morning, I went off to take part in a meeting. 
Q.	Can you tell us which meeting -- what meeting? 
A.	A meeting of the officers, unit commanders, operational zone commanders, and the members -- and at the ministry of defence and at two general staffs.  The meeting had been due to be held at the general staff, but in view of the large number of participants, they sought a much bigger hall, and the choice fell upon the meeting hall at the École supérieure militaire.  So I went to the general staff and I asked the officer on duty, who informed me that the meeting would be held at the École supérieure militaire.  So I immediately went there.  
Q.	To be quite clear, Mr. Renzaho, is this the meeting Colonel Muberuka had informed you of that very morning?  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	Who took part in that meeting?  Who was in attendance at that meeting? 
A.	The list is a long one, I don't know if I could remember the names of everyone who attended.  I only remember a few names.  There was General Ndindiliyimana, General Rusatira; unit commanders such as Leonard Nkundiye from Mutara secteur, Sebahire; there was the paracommando battalion commander; there were officers from the general staff, such as Musirango (sic), Joseph.  I can't -- I don't have the complete list of all the officers who took part in the meeting, but they were very numerous. 
(Pages 37 to 49 by Judith Baverstock)























1530H 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now we only need the last name of the person whose first name was Leonard and the person whose first name was Joseph; so these two were mentioned on the spelling list maybe?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Leonard Nkundiye, the surname Nkundiye, number 377 on the list.  Rusatira, Léonidas, number 475. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just give us the last name of the person whose first name was Joseph now, please.  That is all we need, the rest was easy. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I did not get all the names.  There's a Joseph.  What is the family name? 
A.	Musirikari - M-U-- 
MR. CANTIER: 
344.  344 on the list, Mr. President.  344.  But I don't have the first name. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Very good, let's continue. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, what decisions were taken because of that meeting? 
A.	The main decisions that were taken, in that order, the first was to try and help the politicians to set up an interim government to negotiate with the RPF and to set up the transition institutions.  The second decision was that a crisis committee was set up to manage the difficult situation while awaiting the formation of the interim government.  And the third decision was a recommendation to all the units to try, by all means, to bring back discipline and order in their ranks, to regroup, and to call up their men so as to give them instructions.  Well, I believe that all the points that were discussed at that meeting were contained in a report, and I can't have all of them in my head, but I believe there is a report of that meeting. 
Q.	Witness, who chaired that meeting? 
A.	The chair of that meeting was General Ndindiliymana. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, why did you attend that meeting? 
A.	First, I was not authorised to take part at the meeting, since it was a meeting of unit commanders; I wasn't a unit commander.  It also included secteur commanders, but I did not command any secteur.  It also included general staff officers and officers in cabinets, but I wasn't any of the above.  

So, to take part at that meeting I had to ask for authorisation and I gave the following reasons:  The situation at first view was very dangerous and the initial victims were the population of the city of Kigali.  So I requested that I should attend that meeting so I could put forward the security concerns of the population.  Well, they heard my request and I was authorised to attend the meeting. 
Q.	Witness, you told us that the meeting set up a crisis committee; could you tell us what the duties of that crisis committee was supposed to be? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And before doing so, who authorised you to attend the meeting?  
THE WITNESS:
It was the chair of the meeting and the participants.  The chairman asked whether I could take part in the meeting and the others said:  Why not?  So I took a seat.  It was the chairman to whom I put the question. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So it was raised during the meeting, at the beginning?  
THE WITNESS:
You mean the question of my presence?  Yes, that question was raised at the meeting.  So immediately I got in I raised the question, because to be able to take part in that meeting I had to raise the question.  I couldn't have just entered properly and taken a seat amongst persons who had certain powers that I did not have.  So, I raised that question initially. 
JUDGE ARREY: 
Does this mean that if we saw the minutes of this meeting, it would reflect the fact that you came and asked for permission?  The document containing the resolutions in the meeting, I'm sure had minutes of this meeting.  Would they contain this fact that you came into the meeting, stood up and asked for permission to participate?  
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, if those minutes exist, then they would show that is what happened.  Personally, I read an extract thereof, somewhere in Rwanda, where it arises the resolutions taken, but I didn't see the minutes.  But if the minutes do exist anywhere, then they would show that it happened that way.  Thank you. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, my question was actually directed to the crisis committee that was set up by the meeting; who headed that committee and what were its duties? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  From what I know, the crisis committee was decided upon by that meeting but it did not craft any specific duties for the crisis committee.  It had its major missions, notably, establish contact with political parties, a recommendation to the army chief of staff to ensure follow-up in the units to make sure that the unit commanders installed discipline.  But the duties of the committee were not made known to me.  I think they did not have time to prepare the duties of that crisis committee. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, with respect to the decisions that were taken on that day, a while ago you mentioned a communiqué that it made public --
MR. CANTIER:  
I have here a document, Mr. President, Your Honours, which is in our folder, volume 1, number 37 with the reference K0149001.  The Defence folder number 1, number 37, and the text we have here is in French and a bit of it is in Kinyarwanda.
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I'd like to read out that communiqué to you, so you can tell the Chamber whether it is actually what was decided at that meeting of 7 April. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just a practical matter, in the copies I have of Defence volume 1, the number rotation is from numbers 1 to 30 and then it starts over again from 1 to 23.  Does this mean that we shall look approximately around number 7 in the second round?  Please indicate the exact nature of the document you are just referring to?  You kindly gave us the K number.  But what kind of document is it?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, I do confirm that -- it's a follow-up to your first question.  Secondly, it's a transcript of a programme of regional Rwanda during which the meeting of 7 April held at the higher military academy was mentioned, and during which the decisions or recommendations taken at that meeting were read out. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Prosecution, do you know which number it is in the Defence folder?  
MR. MOSES: 
Number 7 in the second round.  And I don't know if our friend is able to assist us also, obviously he's only concerned with pages 6 and 7 of the document, which are the only pages that are in the bundle.  I don't know if he is able to assist us to know which radio station and the date that it was broadcast.  I think it might be of assistance to us all if -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right, we have located the document.  And now, can you help us with the source, as asked by the Prosecution, Maitre Cantier?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, it's a key document that we found in the records of the Tribunal.  After reading it, it became clear that it was a transcript of a programme, it has no date, but the transcript shows that it is a -- it's a transcript of the meeting that took place on 7 April at the higher military academy.  

Your Honours, knowing that we've looked for the report, as the Honourable Judge asked a moment ago, we couldn't find it and this is the only document that we could find. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, but do you know whether this comes from Radio Rwanda or RTLM?  Do you have any information?  
You, Mr. Renzaho, do you know?  This is a transcription of something that was said during a radio transmission, is there any knowledge in the courtroom?  
THE WITNESS:
I believe it is a transcription of a programme of Radio Rwanda. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, sir, we are trying to find out.  We're looking for it.  And my assistant has just pointed out to me, that the document that I've just mentioned, reappears in Exhibit P. 48, the Prosecution 
Exhibit P. 48.  So it is actually a programme of Radio Rwanda.  

Prosecution, it is your Exhibit P. 48. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Let's continue.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Renzaho, I'll read out the decisions taken, and you'll confirm whether it was what was broadcast over Radio Rwanda on 7 April:  "Participants at the meeting took the following decisions and recommendations:  First, make every effort in collaboration with all the other services concerned for the situation in the country to get back to normal as quickly as possible.  For that purpose, members of the armed forces are urgently invited to get hold of themselves and display restraint and discipline to reassure the population and restore calm in the country.  Second, create a supportive condition or atmosphere to enable the governing structures in the country to work in calm.  And those in the name of the Rwandan armed forces, the participants, I gently request the political authorities to invest more in the discharge of their duties especially at this time of crisis."  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, would you like to say something?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I was sitting quite silently and innocently here.  I hadn't made any sign I think to indicate any intervention.  But it seems to me it is pretty close to P. 48, page K0368587.  I think you're right, or your assistant is absolutely right, that it is the same document.  And we have that document in all three languages, so I'm not so sure that we need to read it into the record following your indication that we already have this as an exhibit.  

So, what is it then that you want to ask Mr. Renzaho about in connection with these four points in 
P. 48?  
MR. CANTIER:
	Well, so we can now be sure of the content of that document, my question to Mr. Renzaho has to do with the fifth decision or recommendation that was taken.  So I could read out that recommendation to him:  "Following the problems, the security problems, participants at the meeting called on the authorities of the préfecture to examine the security situation in their jurisdiction including the curfew, if possible, and they reiterate their call to the population to bear with the situation", and the rest is not necessary.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Renzaho, my question is:  During the course of that meeting were you entrusted with any special mission within that crisis committee?
A.	No, I did not take it that way, in fact I did not receive any special mission.  But that recommendation is clear for all the préfectures of the country, the préfets were supposed to make every effort to restore order and security within their various jurisdictions.  And later on that is what I tried to do unsuccessfully.  I had a bit of success, but it was generally unsuccessful. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I still want to come back on this document, because I consider it essential.  It is one of the earliest official documents after 6th April.  Point number 4, I would like you to comment on that point:  "The senior officers of the Rwandan armed forces call on the population to remain calm and to reject any demands made on them that are likely to fuel hatred and disorder of any kind."  

Sir, how did you understand that recommendation? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I believe that I sat silent in the atmosphere that prevailed in that meeting, and the determination of the participants to try to check the wave of violence that was sweeping across the country, and I thought -- and I heard at the meeting, I heard the speakers saying that for unit commanders the absolute priority was to get hold of all soldiers and bring them under control.  Now, if that means that there were some military men who were uncontrollable and were causing havoc within the population, killing et cetera, so maybe the disorder that was seen was related to that.  So, the absolute priority was to get all these persons under control and establish discipline in all the units.  

I will not hide it from you that at the end of the meeting I had the personal conviction that the situation could be brought under control.  The participants at the meeting displayed so much good faith.  Unfortunately, fighting broke out a few moments later and those involved did not have the time to implement these recommendations. 
Q.	We will come back to this point, Mr. Renzaho.  My next question is:  What did you do after the meeting?  Could you tell us at what time it ended? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  The meeting at the ESF (sic) ended about 12:30 or thereabouts. 
Q.	And what did you do after the meeting? 
A.	After the meeting, I was part of the team that was selected to prepare a message to the nation.  The concern of the participants was to reassure the population and to call on people to remain calm and to avoid plunging into futile violence. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, in spite of the fact that you had to ask at the beginning of the meeting to be present, it ended by you forming part of a drafting committee?  

THE WITNESS:
Well, one thing followed the other.  First of all, they set up the crisis committee before the end of the meeting, and then I was appointed to replace Colonel Félicien Muberuka in the crisis committee and to prepare the message to the nation.  I was part of the team that was supposed to draft the message.  I think that is how one should understand things. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Renzaho, so as to better understand things, the document that was broadcast over 
	Radio Rwanda that you've just mentioned, is it the message you are talking about? 
A.	No, it is not the message that was mentioned, the point you just raised.  The message as such took the form of a communiqué and I would like to tell the Chamber that we have -- we were driven by the concern of involving everybody.  And I recall that as we prepared the message, we had 
	General Dallaire with us who participated.  So a communiqué which came out, which includes all of that message.  That's not what you said.  Maybe there were excerpts of the report of the meeting of what you've just read.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Renzaho, my question now is:  At what time did you leave the small committee that drafted the document and what did you do after that? 
A.	At 2:30 p.m. we received a statement from General Dallaire that the RPF had broken from its base with the intention of going to punish the elements of the Presidential Guard, and emotions were running high, so I left the area where we were to go back to my office and I got there about 3 p.m.  
Q.	Witness, who did you meet on your way back to the PVK? 
A.	When I got to the préfecture I met the bourgmestre of Kacyiru commune, Mr. Nyirikwaya.  He had fled. 
MR. CANTIER: 
The name that has just been mentioned is number 427.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, are you through with your answer? 
A.	No, I want to continue.  
Q.	Please go ahead.
A.	Thank you.  So I discussed the prevailing situation in this commune with him.  And he told me that -- Kimihurura was almost into -- engaged in fighting in the night.  And that is where he was staying and he had come to look for me because he had received a phone call in the morning, because in the 
	message -- I'd mentioned in the message that I'd left to my secretary.  So, I saw that there were already about 50 refugees or so at the préfecture.  Then I discussed with my secretary to have the content of the report I read that morning on the situation, and the report was alarming.  Several persons we tried to contact were not available; they were not found.  And that is the situation of the people I met when I got back to the préfecture. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, to be more specific in your response and to testify as clearly as possible for the Court, you said you'd asked your secretary to contact the bourgmestres and the conseillers; is that what you just referred to, is it?  
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And then, more specifically, what did he say about the conseillers and the bourgmestres that you were trying to contact? 
A.	Thank you very much.  So I had already got the Kacyiru bourgmestre on the spot.  The secretary tried in vain to contact the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge commune and hadn't found him.  He also tried to call the bourgmestre of the Kicukiro commune who was -- who could not be found.  And some had served -- had acknowledged that they were present at home and agreed to come to the préfecture, but others had not been there to answer the call, or had not answered the phone.  So, there was exchange of information.  There was a continuous exchange of information that revealed the absence of some conseillers, some counsellors, who were said to be dead:  Gikondo, Gisozi, Kacyiru, Kagarama, 
	et cetera.  So the situation was very worrisome. 
Q.	Witness, did you try to speak to the citizenry as of the 7th -- already on the 7th in the afternoon? 
A.	Yes, in the afternoon.  I sent a communiqué to be broadcast, a message calling for pacification.  I forgot to tell you that I also tried to know what was the true situation in the préfecture.  So I asked Mr. Butare, he didn't live very far from the préfecture, to try and contact the conseillers and members, those available, to the urban security committee for a meeting at the préfecture the next day, the 8th, as of 
	9 o'clock.  Where there was no other means to contact them, except by phone, so that was done in preparation for the meeting due to be held the next day. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. Butare, Jean Baptiste, is number 66 on the list.  I am referring to P. 48, page 3 in the French and page 2 in the English.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	I will read this to you and you'll tell us if, in fact, it was you who drafted in the afternoon of the 7th:  "The préfet of Kigali urban préfecture calls upon" -- "urges the population to respect the instructions issued by the ministry of defence and calls upon the citizenry not to undertake acts of aggression against others.  To be vigilant in these difficult times and to co-operate with people involved in security and make their task easier.  Every householder is responsible for the security of his home and to prevent infiltration."  

Mr. Renzaho, is that the communiqué you've just referred to? 
A.	Counsel, that is the one I spoke of. 
Q.	Did you come -- did you return home in the evening of the 7th? 
A.	No, I did not return to Kanombe in the evening of the 7th of April.  I attended the first meeting of the crisis committee in the evening after 7:30 p.m.  and the meeting ended quite late, at about 10 p.m., and we were in security because there was fighting throughout the town and I did not dare take the risk of returning to Kanombe and I slept at the préfecture. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, when did the hostilities resume between Rwandan government forces and the RPA in Kigali? 
A.	Well, the hostilities between the RPA and the Rwandan government forces resumed in the night of the 6th to the 7th of April essentially, more particularly towards dawn when heavy guns, shelling from heavy guns was in Kimihurura and the CND near the Medali.  But, more specifically, combat resumed in the afternoon of the 7th of April at about 1 p.m.  This was a general RPF offensive in Kigali town and that was the offensive that General Dallaire came and informed us of.  Thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, did you learn of a statement made by the Belgian military concerning the first combat in the night of the 6th to 7th of April? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, I know that document. 
MR. CANTIER: 
It is in volume 1, Your Honours, item 14. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I will read a short extract from this document and ask you whether the information contained therein is correct.  Okay, 0075307 at the top of the page are:  "Commander Vandrisch then explained to us that the RPF had left the CND and was advancing on our position in order to go and attack Kanombe military camp."  

And I will go on because it is possible to date the document, two paragraphs further on:  "The next day on the 7th of April we had the same task."  

What would be your comment, Mr. Renzaho, on this statement? 
A.	Well, that just confirms what I've just said.  The RPF troops left their barracks at the CND in the night of the 6th to the 7th to seize and guard a number of immediate objectives, which they would require to insure for ensuing operations.  And, on the same line of thinking, that statement shows that, indeed, the RPF had tried to approach, or make a breakthrough in the direction of Kanombe military camp.  And that also confirms, or tends to confirm, the general state of insecurity that I referred to, that I told you about, and after the downing of the airplane continued until about 4 o'clock in the morning.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the Belgian name which was referred to a few seconds ago was spelt V-A-N-D-R-I-S-C-H. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, can you tell us briefly, in brief, what parts of Kigali on the 7th of April fell to the APR (sic)?  I had asked you to prepare a map, to sketch a map, have you done so?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You said which parts of Kigali fell to which army; can you just repeat the abbreviation, Maitre Cantier?  
MR. CANTIER: 
I asked Mr. Renzaho to sketch on a map of Kigali those secteurs of the town that were taken in the evening of the 7th of April by the RPA. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Counsel.  In general terms I would identify the following secteurs:  Kakiru, Kimihurura -- even if it wasn't all of Kimihurura that was conquered --  Remera, Gisozi, Kagugu and two secteurs of Kicukiro that were totally involved in combat.  

In fact, the situation becomes very clear after the 15th of April where you see that all of the north and east and south-east, even south, were totally conquered by the RPF troops; in other words, Kacyiru and Kicukiro, Kicukiro -- only a very little part of Kikundo secteur resisted. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, could you repeat the last sentence, Mr. President, please. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could you repeat the last sentence, Mr. Renzaho?  "In other words", and then you continue. 
THE WITNESS:
I was saying, in other words, Kacyiru, Kicukiro, were totally conquered or involved in combat, mainly in Kicukiro, that part of Kicukiro and part of Kikundo which resisted, thanks to Mburabuturo, a centre of resistance at the place just named. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The two last names, shall we repeat them?  Part of -- be very brief now, please.  Just give me the two names so that we can proceed. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I think he said it was part of Kikundo.  Witness is spelling Kicukiro. 
MR. CANTIER: 
That is number 245. 
THE WITNESS:
Mburabuturo, M-B-U-R-A-B-U-T-U-R-O. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good, that's the one we wanted.  Thank you.  

Next question please?  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, in Kigali préfecture how many secteurs were there?  How many secteurs were occupied by the RPA? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  The préfecture of Kigali -- Kigali urban préfecture consisted of 19 secteurs and until the 15th, ten secteurs were occupied.  

If you'd allow me, I should like to add in fact the occupation as such doesn't mean much, if you don't realise -- appreciate what we're talking about.  The scale -- size of the secteurs and what it means in terms of local government because the administrative structures were completely dislocated.  As regards the size of the secteur, first of all, they blocked entirely all the supply lines and reinforcements that might come from the north to Kigali and all the high points overlooking the capital and from which points the other secteurs would simply -- were simply exposed to cast a bombardment from which they could not resist until the end, because the high point had been occupied by UNAMIR soldiers who in the ensuing days, even after the 6th, began to pull back bit by bit.  Thank you. 
Q.	So, Mr. Renzaho, since you have sketched this map for us, please you will give it to us so we can tender it to the Court.  So that was the situation in Kigali on the evening of the 7th.  Mr. Renzaho, when and how did you learn of massacres in town? 
A.	I learnt of massacres in the town already from my first contact with the refugees that came to the préfecture.  It wasn't on a whim that someone who has a house leaves his house.  So I could feel that things weren't right.  But even in listening to the radio before I left home, I felt that this event that had occurred, the attack, and in view of what had been happening in the previous three months, January, February and March, had forced some persons to flee -- had caused victims.  I could feel that an earthquake was underway and, if other unfavourable factors had not further deteriorated, the situation -- because unfortunate events never occur singularly, but not usually accompanied by the cascade of events that ensued. 
(Pages 50 to 59 by Melissa Hook)



















1630H 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	When did you realise that the massacres were targeting the Tutsi and the political opposition? 
A.	Well, right away I thought that these things were going to happen.  When I heard of the incident that had happened -- the outbreak of the war in Kigali, I felt that something very, very bad was going to happen.  And this was the outcome of the development that had been known in the country on account of the terrible war in which people gradually moved towards radical positions on the issue of war:  who is for war, who is against war.  Who is for war meant who was for the RPF.  And, then, who was against war -- and who was against the ideals of the RPF.  

And so this hardening of the blocs and the -- the -- that phenomenon that developed, it developed between 1990 and 1994 and kept getting worse.  Increasingly, it felt that the conduct of operations, especially on the -- on the side of the RPF -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I didn't get that last sentence, Mr. President, his microphone went off.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's start again, Mr. Renzaho.  You were just about to say something.  "Who is for war meant who was for the RPF", et cetera.  That sentence is all right.  And then, "And so this..." take it from there, please.  Did you talk about crystalisation?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honours, I mentioned the -- the forming and hardening of blocs following these dangerous developments, wherein all the other problems of the country had been forgotten and everybody focussed on war.  And so when the event happened -- and with the tension in which we had been plunged since January of that year, the explosion was well-nigh inevitable, so right away I thought that a disaster was going to call.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, what was -- what were your activities in the morning of 8 April 1994? 
A.	In the morning of 8 April, I took part in a crisis meeting that did not last for long.  We did the bulk of the work the evening before.  I returned to the préfecture for the urban council crisis meeting.  We started at about 9 a.m., and the meeting ended at about 2 p.m., and I didn't have the time to go and visit my family.  I went to Kanombe on that afternoon of the 8th of April, and I returned at about 5 p.m. 
Q.	Yes, Mr. Renzaho, let's look at a few stops on the day of the 8th.  I'd like to ask you:  What was the first meeting that you had on the morning of 9 April -- sorry, 8 April?  
A.	The first meeting I had was a meeting of the crisis committee in the morning; it did not last for long.  Then, I returned to attend the urban council security meeting at the préfecture office.  
Q.	So when you returned to the PVK, after the crisis committee meeting -- and here, we are talking about the morning of 8 April 1994, so what was the first meeting that you had? 
A.	Oh, that is clear then -- it was the meeting of the urban council security meeting, but there were little meetings like that that may not look very important.  Actually, I first made a review of the policemen who were standing there, who had assembled.  Then, I had a discussion with these policemen and their commander.  Then, I briefed them very quickly on the situation that was prevailing, and then I asked them to keep in mind the situation in which we found ourselves.  
Q.	Yes, Mr. Renzaho, that is the question that may be of interest to the Chamber, because those policemen were under your orders; is that not correct?  And, if I understood you well, that was the first contact you had.  So can you tell us how many policemen were present at that assembly, please? 
A.	I found about 45 persons who may have assembled there. 
Q.	Was the police commander present? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, the police commander was present.  
Q.	How do you explain that only 45 policemen were present at that assembly out of the total number that you gave us a while ago? 
A.	Thank you very much.  I think the starting point of the event that occurred in the night of the 6th to the 7th.  The employment system of the policemen was a decentralised one where a number of policemen were assigned to the bourgmestres and the conseillers for some time.  And at the end of their mission, they came back and were replaced by other policemen.  That was the recommendation of the urban council which gave preference to that kind of rotation -- permanent rotation.  Which preferred rotation to permanent employment, rather, because permanent employment may -- may create habits that may harm discipline.  

So, by rotating the policemen, it meant that they'd come back to -- to their original place where others went to replace them on the ground.  And the bourgmestres and the conseillers did not have the same policemen all the time, because that's the rotation system -- were able to keep an eye on all these policemen.  

When the event occurred, we were not able to lay hands on these people.  I believe that there were -- there was talk in the various secteur in which they found themselves.  Some were killed, and maybe some even tried to flee or to desert; that is possible.  

But, the police assembly that morning was made up of 45.  The others had simply disappeared; I could not see them.  In fact, I asked the police commander to -- to carry on and to try to -- to assemble his men.  But with those that we had, we had to start tackling the problem, because we had held a meeting with the responsible persons, and we had to see what we could do.  Those who were able to come could come and tell us the situation they were facing.  But I could not send them away empty-handed without sending some policemen with them to help them in the work of providing security. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
You said that in September-November '91 the number of police officers was about 250.  Is that correct; yes or no?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is what I said.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
In April '94, in principle, was the number the same or had it increased or decreased?  Was it still 250? 
THE WITNESS:
I believe that the 250 figure that I gave was the highest we attained; we could not recruit any more. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
About the same number in April '94, is that the evidence? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And of these 250, only 45 were present at the meeting? 
THE WITNESS:
That is what I saw, and that is the figure I actually saw. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does that mean that 205 approximately had deserted or were some of them on rotation?  
THE WITNESS:
There were -- they did not answer "present" at roll-call.  So we continued to try to assemble them, but that is what I noticed on that day, and it was the first day on which I had the possibility to -- to come in contact again with the administrative structure since the event started. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are going to pursue this, Maître Cantier, because it would be interesting to know the total deployment of police officers from around the 6th of April throughout this 100 days.  But you can choose the timing of your questions.  
MR. CANTIER:
Thank you, Mr. President, I had planned to mention the issue of deployment.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Before that, Mr. Renzaho, I would like you to tell us whether you addressed those policemen in the morning of 8 April, and if your answer is yes, what message did you put across to them? 
A.	I have said that I addressed the policemen -- the policemen present there, and that I briefed them on the security situation in the city of Kigali.  I called on them to invest in the various missions that they would have to help the council authorities to restore law and order -- and above all, to help some persons who may be in danger.  I said so in reference to a meeting I'd held with officials of the commune.  
Q.	So, Mr. Renzaho, my next question is precisely:  How were the policemen then distributed? 
A.	You see, I had a police commander -- at least, on that one I abdicate -- because it was not my duty to distribute people like that; there was a police commander to do that.  I laid down the principles, so the conseillers there received a policeman each to help them in their work of intervening within the population.  But as to what policeman was assigned to what duty, that was the duty of the police commander.  
Q.	So, if we understood you properly, you laid down the principle of giving each conseiller a police officer, and it was then your police commander, Nyamuhimba, who had the duty of implementing that instruction; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that was a leading question.  

Shall we repeat the name of this police commander, it's number?  
MR. CANTIER:
Nyamuhimba -- 414, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, I would like to defend myself on the leading question.  I just wanted to rephrase what the witness has said just to make sure we had understood him.  I was not trying to lead him in anyway. 
MR. MOSES:
With respect, one of the reasons my objection was going to be also -- not only that it was leading, but that it did not, in fact, summarise what the witness had said.  It was, in fact, putting words in his mouth because the witness had never said previously that he had given instructions for one policeman to go with the conseillers.  He had earlier indicated that he had left the logistics, as it were, up to the commander.  So my objection was, in fact, two fold:  One, that it was leading; secondly, that it was in fact misstating and putting words into the witness's mouth.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And now the next question.  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, if you check you'll see that he actually said that he had instructed that the conseillers be assigned an officer, so I did not change anything.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will look at the transcripts, but now we have to move on.  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, if I am not interrupted unnecessarily, I'll move forward.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, you mentioned the meeting that took place after the urban council security meeting -- I think I've not invented that one.  So, can you tell us when that meeting started?  Who participated in that meeting? 
A.	The meeting started at about 9:30, and the participants were certain members of the urban security council meeting who were present, including myself, the bourgmestre of Kacyiru, Munyansanga, a gendarmerie officer, Major --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Something", I can't get it. 
THE WITNESS:
And the conseillers who -- who attended the meeting.  We did not have all members of the urban security -- urban council security meeting at that meeting.  The meeting -- I addressed the war situation that we were living through.  I -- I don't know whether you want me to move on? 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	I'll ask you a specific question, but the name that was mentioned -- you mentioned a Mr. Munyasanga, number 326 of our list of proper nouns.  

Mr. Renzaho, did you give another name?  I can't recall.  
A.	I mentioned a gendarmerie major, Ngirabatware.  There were other officers, Colonel Rutayisire, who was in charge of intelligence at the ministry of national defence.  There were other officers, too, who came as observers.  
Q.	Now, you mentioned Major Ngirabatware, 364.  Then you mentioned Colonel Rutayisire, 479.  
A.	That colonel was not a member of the meeting, he came as an observer to see what was happening.  
Q.	So, we are talking about the urban council security meeting, Mr. Renzaho.  What decisions were taken at that meeting? 
A.	Thank you very much.  After introducing all members around the table, we observed that the situation was very serious.  The administrative structure was in no way responsible for what was happening.  And then I asked, as the first measure, that an administrative authority be restored in -- in the communes or in the commune, because only one was left in the secteur, in the cellule -- to know what was happening.  

Then, since there were people from the gendarmerie -- and the situation was clearly very serious with regard to the fighting, I asked that the collaboration that existed between the administrative structures and the gendarmerie brigades -- that is, the territorial brigades of the gendarmerie, I asked that such cooperation be very close, so that both structures could help themselves mutually so as to check the killing and the confusion that was happening within the population.  

Then, there were very few of us -- very few civil servants had come to the meeting at the préfecture.  And the same situation prevailed in the commune; most people had simply disappeared.  
So, it was necessary to bring together these people and make the little group that was left operational to cope with the situation.  So we had to create flexible, tailored structures capable of carrying out certain activities on behalf of the population.  At that stage, the problems were simply countless.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Renzaho, but my question is:  Who, among the communal personalities, who were those that participated at the meeting? 
A.	I mentioned Bourgmestre Nyirinkwaya who, unfortunately, had lost his (unintelligible) -- his commune.  
Q.	Was the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge present? 
A.	I did not see him.  
Q.	Was the conseillers of secteurs present at that meeting? 
A.	They were present, they were there.  Those who were available were there.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
There was a reference to the name of a bourgmestre who had lost his commune.  Can we have that name again, please? 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President, Pierre Claver Nyirinkwaya, N-Y-I-R-I-N-K-W-A-Y-A.  
Pierre Claver Nyirinkwaya. 
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, it's number 428 on our list.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Could you, if you do recall, cite the names of some conseillers of secteurs who were present at the meeting? 
A.	Honestly, it was a long time ago, and I think my memory's going blunt. (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under separate cover).  Karekezi was there.  Sezibera, I think, was there.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I asked you the names.  You -- you have to tell the Chamber whether you are sure or not.  Do you recall the names of the conseillers who were present at that meeting? 
A.	Frankly, I did not undertake that exercise, but I know that the conseillers were there.  Now, to list them in any kind of order is difficult for me.  Well, except -- I'm given some time to put the pieces together, but they were there.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you just mentioned two names and we want to make sure that we get them right.  Are you able to help us? 
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, Karekezi is number 424 (sic) and Sezibera is number 527.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you say "424" for the first name? 
MR. CANTIER:
No, 224 and 527.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, 224 is correct, yes, thank you.  
MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, what I heard but doesn't appear in the English transcript was something which had indicated something of a witness protection.  Your Honour may need to check the French.  When the witness said that "My memory" -- just after when he said, "My memory is blunt", I had heard him indicate (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under separate cover).  Now, that -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is true.  In the French version we will place under seal at 16:57:06 the part of the sentence starting with (French spoken), and then there are four other words in French.  We will delete that segment, from (French spoken).  And if any of those elements appear in the English version, they will also be placed under seal.  

It's 5 o'clock.  Do you want just to finish what we are doing now or can we simply continue tomorrow morning, Maître Cantier?  

Maybe by tomorrow morning he will be clearer with the names as well, so the night will give some time for reflection.  
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, I do agree.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	But, Mr. Renzaho, (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under separate cover).  You can write them and then send them.  
A.	Yes, Counsel, I will do that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
A final administrative issue:  You have partly referred to Defence volume 1, where there are a lot of documents, partly to the third list of Defence documents which were distributed this morning.  It's important that we know exactly which document you want to tender.  

There is a risk that if you only tender these documents in two days' time, there will be confusion.  So may I ask you and your team to ensure at the end of the day that you are absolutely certain as to what you want to tender, and then when the examination-in-chief is over, that you kindly produce a list in writing so that we can save time.  Will you please do that?  Then we do not have to interrupt you all the time by tendering exhibits.  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, that is exactly the system that we've set in motion this morning and it has worked.  
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Very good.  

We will then continue tomorrow morning at 8:45.  

The Court is adjourned.  
(Court adjourned at 1701H)
