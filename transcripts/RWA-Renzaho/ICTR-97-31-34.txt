MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness NYT, we are now in open session, and your cross-examination continues.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, you have confirmed for the Trial Chamber that there was, in fact, a person called Theogene Sibomana who was in your class, together with Jean François Regis.  Can you recall the names of any of the other classmates in your class? 
A.	I do remember some names.  Let me start with those who were friends of mine.  
Q.	If I could also ask you at the end of each name if you could please spell it as you go through.  It will save us time coming back and asking for a spelling of those names.  
A.	Very well.  

There Emmanuel Muhire.  Muhire is spelt M-U-H-I-R-E.  

Mr. Uwitonze, Uwitonze being spelt U-W-I-T-O-N-Z-E. 

There was also Jean Nepo.  His surname I do not recall, unfortunately.  There was also Hakizimana. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Jean is easy, but that other name?  Can you help us there, please?  
(Page 36 by Ann Burum)

















1215H 
THE WITNESS:
In fact it was Jean Népomuscène.  And I now remember his surname; it was U-M-U-H-O-Z-A.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Maybe I can save some time by putting some names to you to see whether you remember them.  Was there a Jean Népomuscène Nkebabahizi, spelt N-K-E-B-A-B-A-H-I-Z-I?  
A.	Yes, and we were in the same class. 
Q.	Person by the name of Arcade, A-R-C-A-D-E? 
A.	Yes, he was also in the same class as we were.  
Q.	A person Munyontore, spelt M-U-N-Y-O-N-T-O-R-E.  
A.	I know Munyontore but he was in the fourth year of electrical-mechanical class, which means we were not in the same class. 
Q.	Was there a person called Lumumba, L-U-M-U-M-B-A?  
A.	I know Lumumba, but he was in sixth year in the public works section and he would participate in political activities. 
Q.	You said that Jean François Regis enjoyed -- associated with girls.  Who were the girls who he was good friends with?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did he associate with girls or was he interested in girls' things?
MR. MOSES:
I'll rephrase the question.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Small objection, Mr. President, because from what I recall, he said that he was involved in activities that were normally carried out by girls.  
MR. MOSES: 
I am happy to rephrase the question.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Did Jean François Regis have friends who were girls? 
A.	No, and I know Jean François Regis quite well.  He never had any friends who were girls, and if that had been the case I would have been aware of it. 
Q.	Did you know a girl named Helen Umugwaneza, spelt U-M-U-G-W-A-N-E-Z-A? 
A.	I know this girl quite well.  She was in our class, and she also lived in the military camp, in Camp Kigali, and the relationship she had with Jean François Regis was not a special relationship, as you have just suggested. 
Q.	Was there another girl by the name of Jidenet Umuhoza, spelt J-I-D-E-N-E-T and Umuhoza is U-M-U-H-O-Z-A?  
A.	I do not know this name, at least among the people who were in our class.  But I do know a Jidenet Umuhoza and she was in fourth year of automotive mechanics.  
Q.	Who was the principal of the school, EFOTEC?  
A.	At the time it was Mr. Pierre Célestin Barasebwa. 
Q.	Can you spell the surname, please?  Barasebwa, can you spell that name, please?  
A.	Barasebwa is B-A-R-A-S-A-B-W-A -- Barasebwa, B-A-R-A-S-E-B-W-A. 
Q.	And just a couple more questions on the school.  Were there any European teachers who taught at the school?  And do you remember their last names? 
A.	Yes, there was a German man called Pressman.  There was also an Arab man called Qatas (phonetic).  But there was another teacher whose name I do not recall, who was teaching the higher classes. 
Q.	Was that Mr. Hofman, H-O-F-M-A-N?  
A.	Yes, indeed, I do know a man bearing the name Hofman, but I do not recall in which classes he was teaching.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The second name between the two German names, can you help us with that?  
MR. MOSES: 
Qatas that isn't a name that's been -- 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Do you know how to spell Qatas?  
A.	No, I don't.  I would hear his name, Qatas, but I do not know how to spell it.  
Q.	Whilst you have said that you don't believe that Jean François Regis was in -- or ever in a scout group, do you at last confirm that there was a scout group at the school? 
A.	Yes, there was a scouts' movement in the school and there were even four other youth associations. 
Q.	Did you go to the scout group? 
A.	No, I did not belong to any youth movement. 
Q.	Now, you have said that you did not notice any politicians at the Renzaho house.  Is it fair to say, however, Witness that at aged 10, or 11 or 12 or even 13, you wouldn't have known who any well-known politicians were, would you? 
A.	At the age I was at the time, I could not make out a politician from any other ordinary citizen, unless you are referring to people such as Mitale, who lived in the Renzaho's house.  But apart from Mitale, I never saw anybody else except for the members of Renzaho's family.  
MR. MOSES:
It is Mitali, M-I-T-A-L-I.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	One other thing we can agree on, even if we can't agree on the year that it happened, you will agree with me that Jean François Regis moved into the house -- new house in Kanombe, ahead of the rest of his family, didn't he?  
A.	I can only tell you about the things I was an eyewitness to.  I did not give any precise date on which he allegedly moved or other members of his family joined him.  But when we started the school year in September I went to visit François at his house and he was there with Mitali, which I first thought was the houseboy.  

On the second occasion when I returned to that residence, all the members of the family were present, and it was towards the end of the quarter, that is to say, towards the end of December, it was on that occasion that I saw the other members of the family who were present.  
Q.	So you didn't go to the Renzaho house from September, when Jean François Regis moved in, until December; is this what we understand?  
A.	No, I would go there, but the members of the family were only available during the weekends.  I would usually see members of his family come and go, but I am not aware of the exact date when they moved in, in Kanombe.  But let me point out that between September and December I would go to Jean François Regis's house. 
Q.	Witness, in the previous answer you gave, you said that:  "On the second occasion when I returned to that residence, all the members of the family were present".  Are you now saying that it wasn't the second occasion that you found the -- that you had gone to the house when you saw the remainder  of the Renzaho family?  
A.	What I am telling about is what I was able to observe.  When I would go there I would see the members of the family, such as Josiane or Mutesi.  But I would not find all of them there together, and that is the reason for which I cannot confirm when exactly it was that all the members of the family moved in.  And if I referred to that visit in December, it is because it was on that occasion that, for the first time, I saw all the members of the family together and at the same time.  
Q.	Did you provide a statement in April of this year for the Defence of Mr. Renzaho?  
A.	Yes, I did.  I gave a statement to Mr. Renzaho's Defence team. 
MR. MOSES:
And I am referring, Your Honour, to -- I believe it's the fourth paragraph of the body of the document, halfway down that paragraph commencing with the words, "je crois".
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Did you say to the Defence for Mr. Renzaho, on that occasion:

"I can remember that the Renzaho family moved into their new house of Kanombe at the end of 1992, because after the new school year started in September 1992 Jean François Regis remained alone in the house, together with a member of the family"? 
MR. CANTIER: 
Objection, Mr. President. In the French version, this is not what I just heard, because in French, in the text you have before you, he said, "I believe I remembered that the Renzaho family", and so on and so forth.  And not "I can remember"; it was "I think I remember."  When that is said in French it doesn't mean "I can remember."  "I think I can remember" does not mean "I can remember with certainty".  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's true that there is a difference between "I can remember" and "je crois me rappeler", which would mean, "I think I remember".  
MR. MOSES: 
I am happy to go with the "I think I can remember".  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Did you hear -- or do you recall making that statement, Witness?  
A.	I no longer remember the words which I read out, Mr. Prosecutor.  
MR. MOSES:
I have some copies of the Defence statement.  It might be easier if I provide that to the French booth.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, it reads as follows:   

"I think that I remember that the Renzaho family, et cetera, occupied the house in Kanombe -- end of 1992.  At the beginning of school year 1992, Jean François Regis remained alone in the house with someone from the family.  He had come there due to the proximity or the nearness of the school." 
THE WITNESS:
I think that I remember that is what I said in the statement which I gave to members of Mr. Renzaho's Defence team.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	So, Jean François Regis did remain alone with a member of his family until the rest of the family moved in at the end of that year; is that correct? 
A.	I explained that when I went there for the first time I found him with Mitali.  Initially, I thought Mitali was a domestic worker.  But on the other occasions -- on the following occasions when I went there, for example, I would meet Mutesi, but I never saw all the children together at home.  It was on that occasion that I saw them altogether in the house. 
Q.	All right.  So it's possible that Mutesi was also in the house with Jean François Regis?  
A.	At the beginning of the school year in September, but I cannot confirm that Mutesi and Jean François lived alone in that house.  At times I would find Mutesi at home, sometimes I would find Josian; on other occasions I would meet another child from the family.  I don't know what was the family's plan, I am just talking about what I saw and about what I remember.  
Q.	And do we understand that you visited the home three times a week for a year and a half-two years whilst they were living in Kanombe? 
A.	It was during the school year when we were in the same class that I visited him often because I would go there to do my homework with Jean François Regis.  But when I was in the second year I did not go there often.  When I was in my third year, I could go there sometimes even more than three times a week.  So it's particularly during the last school year that I went there most often.  
Q.	So do we take it, it was almost your home away from home?  I don't know how that translates.  It was like a second home for you?  
A.	One's home is one's home, but I was very comfortable with that family, but I cannot say that it was my home.  I visited the house, but I wouldn't go as far as saying that was home.  I was simply visiting them.  
Q.	Do you -- in these regular visits, three times a week or more, did you see much of Mrs. Renzaho there? 
A.	Yes, I saw her often.  Oftentimes after classes, at 4:30 in the afternoon, I would pass at François Regis's house.  From time to time I would see her, but sometimes I would not see her, maybe because she'd not come back home when I got there.  
Q.	So it would surprise you that she didn't remember you having visited the home? 
A.	It would not surprise me because, in view of her age, she didn't -- she did not really monitor all the movements of children's friends who came there to play.  So I would not be surprised if she said that she didn't remember my presence.  Maybe she doesn't remember me as an individual, but she could remember that I am so-and-so's son and that I used to go to their house.  
Q.	So Jean Francois Regis had a number of friends visit, did he?  
A.	I told you that I did not know many of his friends.  I told you that I remember only one of his friends, Emmanuel.  I did not know of him having many friends, as you seem to be saying, at least during the time that I used to visit him. 
Q.	All right. Do you recall what kind of car Mr. Renzaho drove? 
A.	There was a vehicle which his wife used for her business.  Mrs. Renzaho had an official vehicle. I think that it was a Renault 21 or a Renault 18.  It was a white car. 
Q.	Do you agree with me that the home of the president, that is, President Habyarimana, was next door to EFOTEC? 
A.	The president's residence was about 500 metres from EFOTEC. 
Q.	Did you ever attend any reception at -- that was held at the president's -- in the home or the grounds of the president's home? 
A.	No, I have never attended at the reception at President Habyarimana's place. 
Q.	So, if there had been one there, you certainly weren't at it, correct? 
A.	I could not have been at such a reception.  In what capacity would I have been invited there? I did not have any special role at the school.  I was an ordinary student, so I don't see how I could have attended.  I don't know what kind reception you are talking about, Mr. Prosecutor.  
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, that's the end of my cross-examination, Your Honours,.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Any re-examination?  
MR. CANTIER: 
No, Mr. President, no redirect.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, your original préfecture is Gisenyi, is it?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is my préfecture of origin in Rwanda. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that's where your family lived during your early years and you, too, primary school, et cetera?  
THE WITNESS:
When I was born we were based at the Kigali military camp.  I told you that *************************, and up to 1994 I lived in that camp.  I attended the Camp Kigali primary school, up to when I went to EFOTEC.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you were *********************************** at EFOTEC?  
THE WITNESS:
I was a **********************.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Juvénal feast or celebration, did anyone speak on that occasion?  Were there speeches?  
THE WITNESS:
During the three years I was at EFOTEC, no speeches were delivered on that ceremony.  We simply went to school.  We were given a special meal for breakfast and at midday we also had a meal.  On that day, a cow was slaughtered for the students.  Each class organised itself.  We were given some drink, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic; it depended on what one wanted to drink.  We would remain there.  There would be matches throughout the day.  There were no -- there was no ceremony as such, in that there were no speeches, at least from what I saw.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Where there any P and E activities at school -- sport, for students in general, as part of the education?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, we had PE, physical education courses.  They were known as PSE, physical and sports education. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What kind of sports did you do there, do you remember?  Or, to go directly to the point, was basketball one of the activities? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You said that Lumumba was interested in political activity.  Can you tell us what you meant by that, please?  
THE WITNESS:
Some people told us that he had attended meetings outside.  Some students said that they had attended political meetings.  Sometimes they would say things in discussions between students.  That is what we could see in respect of the activities in which he seemed to take part.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And which part of the political spectrum did Lumumba belong to?  
THE WITNESS:
Lumumba said that he was a member of the CDR.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  These were the questions.  We would like to thank you for having come the long way to Arusha to testify and wish you a very safe journey home.  Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there a witness in the adjacent room?  All right.  

Defence, is it about -- 
MR. CANTIER: 
To answer your question, Mr. President, we had planned the next witness to be called here at the beginning of the afternoon -- I mean, for the afternoon session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
If the witness could be excused, please.  

It was indicated that this week there are about six witnesses, and based on the progress we see so far, will we use the entire week this week?  
(Witness excused)  
MR. CANTIER: 
Given the rhythm in which we are moving, Mr. President, it's possible for us to complete our witnesses on Thursday afternoon.  But this is not something that is sure.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have, certainly, Friday at our disposal.  

Turning now to next week, what will be the likely scenario for next week?  How many days are there and how many remaining witnesses are there?  In principle, there are four-and-a-half days next week.  Will we use those days?  

MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, next week we had planned to call four witnesses, but it seems there are three now, because one of them has withdrawn.  So what we imagine is that on Monday the 9th, we would start with a witness we intend to lead via video link from The Hague.  So, next week, there will be three witnesses.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
A video link witness needs to be heard in a different courtroom, and it has been arranged that we will sit in Laity Kama on Monday to facilitate the video link and then be in this courtroom 4, for the rest of next week, just like this week.  

But if there were, in principle, 20 witnesses left from the Defence list, and two come from a certain country where there are difficulties to get them during the present session, if at all, that would give us 18 minus six this week.  That would leave us with 12 minus 3 next week.  That would result in nine.  What then about the remaining nine?  Are they not going to be called?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I am impressed by your calculation speed.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you want to -- do you want to address us on this after the break?  
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, because I have also to make my calculations, but at a slower pace.  Thank you.  
MR. MOSES: 
If it assists the Trial Chamber -- I am not sure why, in terms of the enquiry, whether Your Honours may have other matters on Friday -- what I can indicate, if it will assist in speeding matters up, we are still carrying out some investigations regarding HIN, who is here, but the ten days that we have would mean that he should not be called until Monday.  I am happy for his evidence-in-chief to be led on Friday morning, as long as I am not going to be called on to cross-examine him until the Monday.  I think, in that way -- I believe the video link is a short -- the evidence should not take long.  That would leave a cross -- maybe some of the examination-in-chief and cross-examination of HIN, if not all of it -- we haven't started that -- and one other witness, who I don't believe is terribly long.  So, in terms of next week, I do believe there is a reasonable chance of us concluding by perhaps Tuesday or at the very latest Wednesday.  That's from the Prosecution side of the fence.  
MR. CANTIER: 
I am sorry, learned friend, I don't really follow your order because in our programme HIN, regarding whom information was disclosed to you, will be called here next week and not this week -- not this week.  This week we have actually HW (sic), PPO -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And something "T", the interpreter didn't get the last one.  
MR. CANTIER: 
And then next week we will have video link with MAG (sic).  And it is only after the video link that we will call HIN.  So I assume that this is fine with you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you very slowly, first, repeat the pseudonyms you just referred to for this week, very slowly?  
MR. CANTIER: 
RGI this afternoon, and then WOW, and then PPE (sic), and, finally, BIT.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And what Mr. Moses said was that even if he is entitled, according to the decision, to have ten days for investigations, which would, as you rightly pointed out, Maître Cantier, imply that that witness, HIN, should only be heard next week, he is saying that he will be willing to hear the examination-in-chief of HIN already this Friday so that we do not need a break this Friday, and then he is willing to cross-examine HIN next week after the video link witness.  But that's something you can come back to.  But that was the point, I think.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you for that clarification, Mr. President. We will come back to that later, I think.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And since I understand that we are then not terribly pressed for time, I think we can allow ourselves two hours' lunch break.  And then we will start at 3 o'clock with the next witness. 
MR. MOSES: 
Will we have -- Your Honour said after the break we were going to discuss the witnesses.  It would be useful to know exactly which witness are formally going to be dropped from the witness list because I have received some informal advice of -- I think it's helpful to the Trial Chamber, and certainly to myself, if I have formal notification of that fact.  And if my friend could just be prepared to advise Your Honours, as I think you indicated to him.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could we agree that our first item on the agenda at 3 o'clock will be about five minutes' clarification as to what will happen with the remaining nine witnesses, and then we start with the next witness.  Would that be all right?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Very well, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, the Court is adjourned.
(Court recessed from 1300H to 1502H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  Before the break, we agreed that it would be useful with an overview of where we are in respect of remaining Defence witnesses.  Maître Cantier?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President.  Now, regarding the remaining witnesses, I don't want to come back to what we discussed this morning.  Now, for next week -- for the rest of this week and for next week, except that we are going to officially withdraw a witness from our list, a witness who was to appear next week, and that is Witness NAH.  So next week -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you are now withdrawing Witness NAH, which is number 29 on your list; is that so?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I do not have the list with the numbers, but it is indeed Witness NAH.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MR. CANTIER: 
That is the first comment.  Second comment, and that relates to the witnesses that we will be leading in -- during the course of the session that begins from the 27th of August.  We are expecting Witness SMB.  We shall be having Mr. Renzaho.  There will be two witnesses, MAI and KIC, but we are not sure for now if they will be able to appear; and this for administrative reasons.  These are persons who are refugees in a country which appears to agree to let them go, but says they will not allow them to come back.  If we are not able to resolve this situation, we have to give up calling Witnesses MAI and KIC.  It is the witness protection section which is in direct contact with these witnesses and the host country.  

We shall be presenting to the Chamber, between now and the end of the week, requests for leave to call four additional witnesses.  This, Mr. President, Your Honours, to cater for the many defections that we have suffered, and the Chamber knows the reason.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, with this schedule that I have in front of me, we could, pursuant to the wishes of the Chamber, finish calling our witnesses within the two weeks that will start, first, on the 22nd August, and the second one, the 3rd September.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Including Mr. Renzaho?  
MR. CANTIER: 
I believe including Mr. Renzaho. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And including the remaining expert?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, since the second expert witness that we intend to call relating to the structural causes of judicial errors has withdrawn for reasons that I have given the Chamber, and we have not been able to find anybody as a substitute, we shall be producing the work done by the expert, Kent Roach. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So Kent Roach will not testify as a witness, but his publications will be referred to as part of closing arguments; is that the logic?  
MR. CANTIER: 
That is the case, Mr. President. That is what the Chamber suggested.  We would have preferred to have a witness, but unfortunately we were not able to have him.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But then we take note that witness Kent Roach, which is number 37 on the list, is also withdrawn.  So where does this then leave us?  There will be -- let us repeat, how many witnesses remaining this week, including the one coming in five minutes?  
MR. CANTIER: 
For this week, Mr. President? Well, for this week we are going to have the one being called in a moment, Witness RGI, then we have WOW, then witness PPO, and then witness BIT, as was scheduled.  They are here and available.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And next week three witnesses, you said?  
MR. CANTIER: 
That is the case, Mr. President. There will be the witness by video conference on Monday, Witness MAJ.  He is a witness who, in my opinion, should take about four hours or more, depending on my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.  

There may be a problem of time belts, in relation to Europe.  I do not have the details from the witness protection section in relation to the video conference that will be done from The Hague.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
When it comes to the video conference, normal practice in this Chamber has been that we start at 8:45, hearing witnesses who are in Arusha, and then in view of the one-hour time difference with The Hague, we then start the video link at 10 o'clock, which means 9 o'clock European time.  Then we can fill all the time with witnesses, and we split up the Arusha witness and give priority to the video-linked witness from 10 o'clock. 
MR. CANTIER: 
That means, Mr. President, that we can begin with HIN at 8:45, break at ten, and continue with Witness MAJ, and then come back to HIN, either in the afternoon of the 9th or, at the very latest, in the morning of the 10th.  I believe with HIN we will be done on Tuesday 10th, in the evening of that day.  

We would then be left with Witness NAZ for whom we have scheduled half a day, maximum, I think, we would have finished with NAZ at 1 o'clock -- 1 p.m. on Wednesday.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Any comments from the Prosecution? 
MR. MOSES: 
Just a couple, Your Honour.  In terms of the list as it stands, we were advised informally in a meeting, Your Honour, that the Defence were not going to call Witness HGG. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which is number?  
MR. MOSES: 
I think I have a slightly older -- it's number 22 on mine but it may not be on -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, HGG is number 23.  
MR. MOSES: 
We have been advised informally, Your Honours, and Your Honours have been as well, that that witness is to be dropped, but I don't think it's been done in open court.  So, for the record, if there could be confirmation of that fact in open court.  The other witness on the list, Witness RAP -- around 25 on my list, but it may be slightly -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, 31 on the 14th of May list, yes.  
MR. MOSES: 
We have not been given any formal indication as to whether that witness is now going to testify.  And my informal indications are that perhaps he may not be, but once again I think it's preferable that we record formally if that witness is to be withdrawn.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could we have your comments on those two witnesses, Defence?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. The bad news is coming in dribs.  So, let me confirm that Witness RAP will not appear.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can consider Witness RAP as withdrawn?  
MR. CANTIER:
That is the case.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you may wish to say in open court what you said in the informal meeting concerning HGG.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, that witness, who was to come from Rwanda, told us that he is not able to come, so we have given up on him as well.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
And then we noted the request for new witnesses.  That will require a motion, of course, to which the Prosecution would respond and the Chamber will have to decide.  If we start on the 27th of August, it's important that motion be filed rather fast. 
MR. MOSES: 
That was my final point, Your Honour -- is that I must express concern that we have not been provided any reason why SMB should not be testifying in this session.  I am aware, Your Honour, that is -- that person is a witness who was listed on one or more occasions in the Military I trial but who for one reason or another never chose to turn up, or didn't come.  It seems as if perhaps a similar situation is arising in this trial, but we have received no explanation in respect of that witness, other than he now is to be listed for the following session.  

Now, on my reading, Your Honours, there is the possibility of that witness, who is not necessarily all that short; an expert witness, MAI and KIC, who I accept are not lengthy witnesses, plus possibly four other witnesses, plus the Accused.  I -- bearing in mind the indication that this time was to be used to call witnesses, and bearing in mind I accept that, so far as MAI and KIC, those are matters outside the control of my learned friend, and there is no criticism at all of them.  My concern is that an application is being filed now or at the very -- towards the very end of this session when the issues as to problems with witnesses have been made known to Your Honours since the very commencement of this Defence session and, if not, even prior to it.  I am uncertain why it is that such a motion is being filed at this very late stage, which does not provide Your Honours with a chance to rule on it so that these witnesses can be called during this session, which is the session which has been scheduled to hear the Defence factual witnesses.  

I don't know that I can take it any further than that.  I just wanted to indicate the Prosecution's concern at the late application which is to be filed.  Thank you, Your Honours.  
MR. CANTIER:
This belated motion which will be filed is due mainly to the defection of a certain number of witnesses, particularly those from Rwanda.  The Chamber is aware of the difficulties that we have encountered, and the latter ones extremely serious, and they occurred last week.  

For Witness MAI, he is somebody who had to flee Rwanda and who is in a host country.  And I explained a while ago that that person, as of today, if he were to leave that country stands the risk of not being able to go back.  

Regarding Witness SMB, I share the concern and questions raised by my colleague.  This is an important witness who assured us of his collaboration and who was to attend this session, but who told us that he is unable to come.  Mr. President, Your Honours, we do not control this kind of situation.  For now, he keeps saying that he will come and testify.  So we hope that he will come and testify.  But I am not able to give you any further assurance. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Will you be able to file your motion for variation of witness list by tomorrow?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, may I request for one additional day because we are very tight.  Today is Tuesday and I can commit myself to submitting that on Thursday, if the Chamber will accept that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, but that's good negotiations technique.  

And you will probably respond pretty fast because we would really wish to make a decision on this by next week so that we know clearly which witnesses to call in the August session.  Would you be able to expedite yours, Mr. Moses, as usual?  
MR. MOSES: 
I hope so.  Yes, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And then, depending on the outcome of that decision, we have this problem of time.  The accused will, by necessity, be time-consuming.  Should this witness, to whom you have both referred, occur, that will also require time.  We do not know really what will happen to those two witnesses from that particular country.  But it seems to be wise to slightly increase the number of days in the next session.  

In the informal meeting we had, we had two alternative commencement dates; one was starting on the 27th of August, and one was about the 20th of August.  If we started on the 22nd of August, would that cause any problems to anybody?  
MR. MOSES: 
It's only the finishing time that was a concern to me, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, it's important that we stick to Friday the 9th as the last day, but we are, as a gesture, proposing that we can start a bit earlier so that the Defence witnesses will not be too condensed in time.  Would the 22nd be all right with you, Maître Cantier?  
MR. CANTIER: 
We are in the hands of the Chamber, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you are comfortable with that?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. No problem.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much indeed.  

Any other matters?  

Before we bring in the witness, there has been another administrative matter pending for some time relating to Witness NIB.  I understand that has been problematic.  We have been in touch with the registry today and have indicated that the Chamber has, of course, no problems in sending that witness back if the registry is not in a position to carry out investigations as fast as possible.  So that witness can, in the Chamber's view, be released, and it's then up to the Defence and the registry to decide how to approach that matter.  Is this a helpful suggestion?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, what happened with this witness is for me, as a lawyer, serious.  We immediately, by letter dated 20th June, requested the registry to open an investigation.  I -- to date it's unfortunate that nothing has still been done, in spite of our daily presence at the registry on this issue.  On our side, as far as this witness is concerned, we say, today, that if he is not able to get back to his country it is catastrophic from the economic standpoint, and also that his lengthy absence will make people think that he came here to testify, so that constitutes a risk for his security.  

That is the situation in which we find ourselves, Mr. President.  From a humanitarian standpoint and for the two reasons that I have advanced, we cannot oppose his return to the country.  But I would like to deplore here vehemently what happened.  I have a certain notion of my job and of justice and which makes it difficult for me to bear the idea that what this witness has said may be the truth.  But I don't know anything about that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That goes on record.  There is then agreement that this witness can be returned.  

Can we bring in the next Witness, please?  

I thank both parties for the contributions in planning our future work. 
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
(Microphone not activated)  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the witness's microphone is not on.  Thank you, sir.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness and will be referred to as witness RGI in these proceedings.  You have to tell the truth and the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
(Declaration made by Witness RGI in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have a document in front of you there, Mr. Witness, with your signature, isn't that so?  
THE WITNESS:
That is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the information in this document is correct, isn't it?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, the information is correct.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Matemanga.  
MR. MATEMANGA:
D. 68.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. 68 admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Defence?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
WITNESS RGI,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, good afternoon.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, where were you living in April 1994 and what was your occupation? 
A.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness, it's important to speak slowly -- 

THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- and there is a need to observe a pause between question and answer, and answer and question.  That's because of transcription and interpretation.  
MR. MOSES: 
Far be it for me to want to place matters in closed session, Your Honour, but it would -- it would seem as though that sort of information might well describe who this person is.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have to place the answer from 15:37:04 under seal.  

Mr. Witness, we are in open session, so you must not give information that can possibly reveal your identity.  That's why we have this document here, under seal.  

Now, the next question.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, it's true that I should have asked for a closed session.  But since it will be for a few minutes I thought it was not necessary particularly since we have been sitting in a closed session for a long time and I also want to take into account our public.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, your occupation, therefore, placed you among senior officers in the body to which you referred.  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  I was -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, he has mentioned his rank.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, do not give information which may reveal your identity.  This relates to your exact profession and place in any hierarchy that may exist.  Thanks to the interpreter, this did not come on record.  All right?  Have you understood the need to reflect a little bit before you provide information?  
THE WITNESS:
I have duly taken note of that, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Very good.  

And the next question.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
I have taken note of that, Mr. President. I am wondering whether I shouldn't request for the early part of my examination-in-chief for a brief closed session so as to avoid slips, particularly on the part of the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
About five minutes?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, five or ten minutes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will have to do that.  And then those in the public gallery are welcome back in ten minutes.  

We will then move into closed session.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 55 to 57] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness RGI, we are now in open session and your examination-in-chief continues.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, were you aware of the document which governed officers of the gendarmerie? 
A.	As an officer of the Rwandan armed forces, I knew that document. 
Q.	Now, please don't refer to yourself in person, because we are in an open session, I just want to know about the statute governing the armed forces and avoid things which might reveal your identity.  

Now, could you please answer my question, Mr. Witness?  
A.	I knew those rules and regulations.  
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Witness, with leave of the Court, I am going to show you a document, and regarding which I would ask you to comment on certain portions and tell us whether the document refreshes your memory.
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, this is the document on status of Rwandan armed forces officers, which has been dis -- which is in binder 1 of the Defence, binder 1, tab 33.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you want the one-page document or the six-page document to be placed before the witness, now?  With other words, do you want page 712 or 714?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, this is not the document I am referring to.  It's not in the file.  I am talking about the file or binder which we distributed.  This is it.  I think that we gave a binder of documents which we intend to use to all the parties.  We intend to use those documents in this session.  And when I talk of our reference now, I am actually talking to that binder.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The registry is now finding that document.  Could you repeat the reference, please?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President. That is binder 1, tab number 33, presidential decree of 5th March 1974 governing status of officers of the army.  

Mr. President, I think that the reference given might not be accurate because -- I apologise, Mr. President, let me try to get the accurate reference with the help of my team, if you allow me to do so.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just take your time.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I apologise sincerely.  I gave the reference of another document.  Now I will go back to the right document.  I am talking about binder 2 and tab 4 -- binder 2, tab 4 of Defence documentation.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
A good working method is the following: We have all received binders previously, but they are voluminous and heavy and we cannot always carry them with us, all of us.  It would be helpful if an email could be sent the day before if you want to draw our attention to any particular document so that we can make sure that it is under our fingertips.  But, now, we will simply proceed.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
We have taken due note, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, now, in front of you, you have the presidential decree of 3rd January 1977 governing status of officers of the Rwandan armed forces.  Does this document jog your memory?   
A.	Yes, the document -- or, the laws governing status of officers of the national gendarmerie, is it the same?  The decree governing status of the officers of the Rwandan armed forces and gendarmerie were -- was actually the same document, as far as the officers of both the gendarmerie and the national armed forces were concerned.  
Q.	Thank you for that answer, Mr. Witness.  

Mr. Witness, on page 3 of this document, I would like to read out from that page -- I would like to read the provisions of article 10 written as follows:

"An officer may be transferred by presidential decree from the armed forces to another state department.  The transferred officer shall conserve all his acquired rights.  An officer may be seconded from the armed forces by a presidential decree pursuant to the provisions of articles 16 and 17 of the legislative decree of 19th March 1974 governing the general status of state employees.  An officer may be entrusted with an official mission outside the country on behalf of the country by the president of the republic.  An officer may be placed by the president of the republic at the disposal of a government department or any other body while remaining governed by the statute of the armed forces".  

End of quote from this document.  

Now, Mr. Witness, my question is as follows: To which category of these provisions were you referring when you talked about Préfet Renzaho's situation?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you actually have this provision in mind, Mr. Witness, when you gave your testimony or are you looking at it now?  
THE WITNESS:
He is concerned by the paragraph which says that an officer may be placed by the president of the republic at the disposal of the a government department or any other body while remaining being governed by the statute of the armed forces. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I saw my learned friend show a sign of disapproval, and I appreciate that because I should have asked the witness whether he was actually referring to this -- these provisions when he was talking about Préfet Renzaho, but he didn't -- that was not the case.  So let me move on.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in view of this provision, what difference could you concretely draw up between the officer, Préfet Renzaho, placed at the disposal of the government, as opposed to any other officer covered under other provisions which are not under article 10, to which I read to you?  
MR. MOSES:
Before the witness answers that question.  Your Honour, my submission is this is asking the witness to give a legal interpretation of a statute; something which he is not qualified to do, so I would object to it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Don't you think that the legal provisions will speak for itself and you, as a lawyer, will be able to refer to it in your closing arguments?  What is it of a factual nature this witness can help us with?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I would like to answer by pointing out that we know the status of this witness.  Since we are in public session, I don't think when I ask him the questions and word the question like this, I am moving away from his area of competence, and I am not asking him to describe in detail.  I think he is qualified to talk about these things.  I am asking him to point out the difference between the Accused, on the one hand, and the others, on the other hand.  I don't want to go further by defining whom I mean when I talk about "the others", because I am sure the Trial Chamber knows what I mean. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are not a lawyer and we are not really interested in your legal interpretations, so to the extent you embark into those troubled waters, we will sustain the objection.  But do you have anything of a factual nature or anything based on your experience which could shed light on the question by Defence counsel?  Do you remember the question still or shall we ask him to repeat it?  
THE WITNESS:
I prefer that the question is repeated.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, do I have to repeat it when the objection has been sustained?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have to repeat the question because we will allow the witness to answer your question, as long as he doesn't appear as a legal expert, and it may be that he will avoid that trap.  Now, please, repeat your question.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, my question was to know if Colonel Renzaho, as an officer, was different from the other officers of the armed forces, since he was not carrying out the duties that are described in the provision that we have just read, duties that were supposed to be assigned to him by the head of state? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you understand the question?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understand, and I will attempt to give an answer.  

In these provisions, there are various issues.  When it says that the officer may be put -- the officer who is put-- seconded to the public service is governed by a statute of the armed forces, there is the issue of advancement in rank.  The colonel can continue rising in rank, that is -- or, contrary to those who will 
be -- who will remain at a certain rank at the time this officer was seconded to another service.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is confusing and not very clear.  I think you should move on and come back with the legal arguments based on your own legal professional skills, Mr. Nekuie.  This witness will not be able to help us much with law here, and that's what it is now.  Shall we continue?  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, which chain of command does the road security company in Kigali-ville belong? 
A.	The road security company was under the chief of staff of the national gendarmerie. 
Q.	Within the general staff of the national gendarmerie -- and still in the reference to the road safety unit -- the préfet of Kigali-ville did he have authorities -- did he have any authority? 
A.	The préfet of Kigali-ville had no authority whatsoever on the road safety unit or, for that matter, on any other unit of the national gendarmerie.  The only relationship that may exist is the commandeering of the troops, which has to go through the national gendarmerie, and that request will be translated into an order by the national gendarmerie.  So the orders go directly to the units who will then implement such orders. 
(Pages 58 to 61 by Judith Baverstock)










1615H 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, at that time, did you know the other units of the gendarmerie which were established in 
Kigali town? 
A.	The road safety company was -- was in the same camp as the mobile company of Kigali; this is a unit that was in charge of security of sensitive installations.  There was another unit called a music company in the Kacyiru camp.  There were various units, and, among others, there was the 
QG company, the Kigali detachment, the technical services detachment, the gendarmerie buildings company, the soldiers of the criminal investigations centre, and the unit for -- the unit in charge of the Kanombe airport; the soldiers of -- the soldiers in the security unit who are in charge of the security of important personalities.  I believe I can stop at this stage. 
Q.	Witness, are you able to tell us if on any of these units, if the préfet of Kigali-ville had any authority over any of these units? 
A.	He had no authority whatsoever on any one of these units.  Within the Rwandan armed forces there was a hierarchy and the units were directly under the general staff headquarters, and did not receive orders from anyone but from the -- the general staff headquarters.  

The préfet cannot give orders to the soldiers.  What he did was what he did as an officer:  An officer maintaining order in his préfecture, and if the order is disturbed then he has to go through the appropriate hierarchy to request for orders. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are not remembering the pause, the two of you, between the question and the answer and answer and question.  

Mr. Witness, you referred to one company, and just let me make sure that we got it correctly.  You did refer to la compagnie QG, didn't you, quartier général, is that the abbreviation or what does it stand for?
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President, I'm sorry for using the abbreviation, général -- quartier général, and it is the company for soldiers who work in the offices in the ministry of defence and for those who are in charge of the general services within the camp.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, I'd like to ask you all the same:  The status of officer of the armed forces -- of 
Colonel Renzaho, does that not detract from the answer that you have just given? 
A.	Can you please repeat the question? 

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Let me repeat it and reformulate it, Witness.  

The fact that Préfet Renzaho had a rank of colonel within the army, does that not take him away from the limits of the authority of the préfet, as you explained? 
A.	I believe I was explicit in that when I was answering -- when you asked me about the status of Préfet Renzaho in relation to my own.  I said that once he was appointed préfet of Kigali town, he was exempted.  It's not even an -- it's not even an exemption.  Maybe I should use the same term:  He was exempted from carrying out military duties, because this time he's going to carry out duties within another administrative unit, which is different from the central administration.  

In no way can he come back to exercise the duties of a commander or any other duty within the military hierarchy, except if there's another ministerial order to bring him back to the ministry of defence to exercise military duties.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, what were the missions of all these units that you mentioned within Kigali town? 
A.	Are you able to clarify the dates, please? 
Q.	We are in 1994, and I'm talking about the general duties.  I'm not asking you to go into the details of -- the specific details.  But what were the general duties of these units, including the road safety company in Kigali town? 
A.	Let me start with Camp Kacyiru.  I listed a large number of units.  Some of these units were only support units or services.  Among others, the technical services group was a small unit which is in charge of maintenance of the carpool of the gendarmerie.  The buildings company of the gendarmerie is in charge --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness.  

You cannot possibly be interested in these details.  You want a particular general approach now, don't you? 
MR. NEKUIE:
That is the case, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So please try to maybe reformulate the question in a way so that the witness assists us in the way you think he should.  

BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	I'll rephrase it.  

Witness, what I want to know, in a general manner are the tasks assigned to the national gendarmerie within Kigali town? 
A.	Thank you for clarifying the question.  I think the mission of the gendarmerie in Kigali is not any different from the mission of the gendarmerie elsewhere in the country.  The mission was as follows:  The maintaining and re-establishing of law and order; judicial police; rural police -- let me repeat.  So there was the mission of re-establishment of public order; the mission of rural policing; the mission of judicial police, and there was also the execution of judicial orders.  In general, those were the duties of the gendarmerie, and if you want me to explain one or the other duty further --
Q.	Yes, Witness, for now, I just want a number of clarifications on the periods during which these duties were assigned to the gendarmerie.  Were they the same duties in peacetime as well as wartime? 
A.	There were the same duties in peacetime as well as wartime, but in times of war, there was another duty -- that is, the duty of the operational defence of the national territory.  That is to say that in times of war the gendarmerie may take part, and that on orders or the decision of the minister of defence, may participate in combat with -- together with the armed forces or the soldiers of the Rwandan armed forces. 
Q.	This other duty, which is added in times of war, how does that impact on the previous duties that you mentioned earlier on?  Was it -- did it -- did it have a higher priority or was it residual in relation to the other duties that you mentioned? 
A.	Are you able to clarify, because you used the word "residual"?  
Q.	Yes, Witness, maybe I should simplify further.  I want to know if between the two types of duties, because the second duty is added on in times of war, was there one that had more priority over the other?  That is the sense of my question.  
A.	Yes, of course.  The defence of the national territory had a higher priority over the others.  The borders of the -- of the country are not safe if they are attacked by the enemy.  If the borders of the country have not been attacked by an enemy, then that duty is secondary.  But that does not mean that the gendarmerie lost sight of this principal duty.  
Q.	We are still within the context of wartime.  The situation of the préfet of the town in which this gendarmerie unit may be located, the situation of these authorities - or, powers, did they change?  Did the préfet acquire greater authority in relation to a normal situation? 
A.	There is no difference regarding the duties of the préfet or the authority of the préfet in times of peace or in times of war.  The law has to be respected, be it in time of war or in time of peace.  And the requirement of troops are to follow the same procedure.  He had no authority over any unit of the unit -- he had no authority over any of the units. 
Q.	And regarding the operations of the defence of the territory, which became an additional mission of the gendarmerie, the préfet of the town in which the gendarmerie units were located --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, I'm sorry, Your Honours, I didn't hear the end of counsel's question. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, can you repeat your question, Maître?  We lost a part of it.  Just repeat your question, please.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	The question was as follows, Mr. President:  Regarding the operation of defence of the territory, which is the additional duty assigned to gendarmerie units in times of war, did -- was the préfet given additional authority in relation to the units fulfilling these duties? 
MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, I didn't object to the previous question.  Clearly this witness, by virtue of his position, has some expertise in military matters.  But at the moment, we are getting general comments without reference to -- for example, statutes or documents which give the witness the -- he can refer to, to say, "Under the statute the préfet does not have any duties or under this statute in a time of war one thing takes priority over another".  

If we don't have that foundation for the witness to give that testimony, then all we are getting, with the greatest of respect, is unfounded opinion evidence which has no basis.  

So, I guess what I'm saying to Your Honours is -- my objection is that the Defence are not laying any foundation for the witness to give this opinion, or evidence, or is he interpreting, once again, statutes?  
I don't know, but it's very unclear.  If he's interpreting statutes, then there's no reference to the statute.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have sympathy for this.  It would be helpful to everyone in the courtroom if we knew the basis for the witness's testimony.  Maybe you would wish, in connection with these questions, to ask him to provide his basis, and that will also strengthen your own case, Mr. Nekuie.  Why don't you do that? 
MR. NEKUIE:
I'll try to do that, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, as part of the duties that you exercised, did you have the opportunity to be in Kigali town in time of war? 
A.	I lived -- I lived through that from the 6th of April 1994, following the killing of the president of the republic.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you have the opportunity to observe that there were transfers -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, could the interpreters be allowed to change headsets because we couldn't hear? 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Matemanga, could you make sure that we have an extra headset?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I think the first one was faulty, thank you, sir.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you repeat your question again, Mr. Nekuie?  So that we are sure that we get it in its entirety in both languages.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in that situation of war in which you found yourself, did you see any transfer of powers of the préfet of Kigali city in respect of units of the gendarmerie who were discharging any of the duties of the gendarmerie, which you listed? 
A.	No, never.  
MR. NEKUIE:
I don't know whether there's still problems in the interpreters' booth? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
No, there's not, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Now Mr. Witness, when you were in Rwanda, were you informed of the date on which Préfet Renzaho was appointed to the Kigali city préfecture? 
A.	Without giving any specific information, I can say that it was around the middle of October 1990.  
Q.	Did you know him at that time, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I knew him as an officer of the Rwandan armed forces, and as a member of the Rwandan armed forces.  He was assigned as the director of studies at the higher military academy -- that is, the 
École supérieure militaire before being appointed to the Kigali city préfecture.  
Q.	Did any particularly unusual event or events take place during that period when Colonel Renzaho was appointed to the Kigali city préfecture? 
A.	Could you please repeat the question, Counsel?  
Q.	During that period, that is, in October 1990, when Renzaho was appointed, was there any unusual events in Kigali city? 
A.	Colonel Renzaho was appointed préfet of Kigali city préfecture when the country was a victim of invasion by RPF who invaded the country from -- through the Kagitumba border post on the 
1st of October 1990.  

Following that incursion and on the basis of information or based on hearsay from the US embassy, there was mention of attacks in Kigali on the 4th to the 5th at night, and on that night, actually there was shooting, and the Rwandan armed forces responded to that.  On the following day -- 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness, couldn't we simply say he was appointed in a period when there were attacks; that's the point, isn't it?  Isn't that the point, Mr. Nekuie? 
MR. NEKUIE:
That was what I was looking for, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So don't give these long answers, just focus on the core.  But now when you gave that long answer we got a lot of information and we have to make sure that the record reflects what you said. 

So you said that the country was a victim of invasion by the RPF which invaded the country from...and then you mentioned a particular border post.  Are you able to repeat the name of that border post, please, because we didn't get that one? 
THE WITNESS:
The border post of Kagitumba, on the Rwandan-Ugandan border, Kagitumba.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  And here is the next question.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in the midst of the population of Kigali city, did the attack create any reaction which you happen to remember still? 
A.	Thank you.  This is what I was getting at in respect of the previous question.  On the night of the 
4th to the 5th, I was saying that in Kigali there were rumours of an imminent attack, and those rumours had come from the embassy of the United States of America.  And effectively on the night of the 
4th to the 5th, there was firing on Kigali city; the Rwandan armed forces responded.  

On the following day -- that is, on the night of the 5th, there were arrests of people who were described as being acolytes or accomplices of the enemy.  There were massive arrests which involved Tutsis.  Those arrests were the subject of being discredited by the Rwandan government.  Actually, they were disputes involving the Rwandan armed forces which had carried out the arrests, so the issue was entrusted to -- 
Q.	Mr. Witness, please allow me to move on together with you without getting out of the context in which we are.  You talked about arrests and that is enough for me, Mr. Witness.  

The following question -- since you also talked about the fact that Rwandan armed forces were the ones which -- were the people who carried out the arrests, can you please tell me whether the préfet of the city of Kigali préfecture had the occasion of associating -- of being associated with those arrests in Kigali city? 
A.	No, he was not yet in that post.  I told you that he was appointed around the middle of October 1990.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know whether, upon his appointment, he had to deal with people who had been arrested? 
A.	The question regarding people who had been arrested was entrusted to a governmental commission which was led at that time by the minister of justice.  The préfet only provided information to the commission without any other details.  And the findings of the commission were that the problem regarding those people arrested was as follows:  Some people were released and some were brought to justice; that was the commission's findings.  
Q.	When you talk about information provided by the préfet, could you please be more explicit?  What kind of information are you talking about regarding that time, Mr. Witness? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, again to know the basis of your testimony, were you in Kigali in October 1990? 
THE WITNESS:
I was in Kigali.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So when you are testifying now, is that based on your observations or based on reports by commissions? 
THE WITNESS:
What I observed is actually what I heard by looking at the results or the findings of the report.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
A report which was submitted when? 
THE WITNESS:
The commission submitted the report to the country's president, and based on facts, some people were released, whereas some people were brought to justice.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And when was that report submitted to the president? 
THE WITNESS:
I don't remember the exact date, I apologise, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was it in 1990 or a year or two after? 
THE WITNESS:
I think it must have been in 1992.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And when did you read that report? 
THE WITNESS:
I mean, this was based on people who had been released and other people who were charged.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You know, it's just about clarity.  Is it then the situation that what we are hearing from you now is based on a report published around 1992, and you are not able to remember when you read that report?  Is that the testimony? 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, those events took place a long time ago.  We went through various episodes, so it's difficult for me to remember exact dates.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you remember when you read that report? 
THE WITNESS:
Actually, I did not read the report.  I made deductions based on the findings which led to the release of some people and the charging of some people.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
How can you make deductions based on findings if you haven't read the report? 
THE WITNESS:
That's because that issue created a lot of noise in the country, and even at -- on the level of the international community.  And this time around, the people concerned had their cases sorted out or explained.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Couldn't you help us, Defence counsel, to establish an efficient dialogue with this witness?  I'm sure you will be able to succeed.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, with your leave, I'm going to move on with this witness to a more concrete stage and ask him questions which are actually linked with what he might have done, and I'm going to leave the more or less institutional aspect of the issue.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you were occupying the post that you told the Trial Chamber, under what atmosphere did you -- did you and your soldiers discharge the duties which were assigned to you in Kigali city?  What was the prevailing security situation at that time?  That is my actual question.
MR. MOSES:
Sorry, Your Honours, just to clarify:  I'm not sure what time we are talking about.  Is this 1990 or 1994?  I'm sorry, Your Honour, but I think your last questions highlight the need for a foundation to be laid for questions to be asked.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have previously explained to us, Mr. Witness, that you occupied your post from September '93, was it to March '94?  
THE WITNESS:
Up to May.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, which period are you referring to?  The entire period or a portion of that period, Defence counsel? 
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I think that if the Prosecutor had listened to my question, he would have not made those comments, because I asked him when he was at the head of his unit.  We're in public session -- we're in public session, because he had already mentioned the dates -- the date from which he started working in that post.  So I'm asking him:  What was the security situation during that period in Kigali city?  In other words, when he was in that post, since I was -- we were in public session, I wanted to be cautious by avoiding mentioning the date. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that is very commendable.  The problem is that the security situation may be very different before or after April '94.  And since this witness occupied his post both before April and after, there may be a need for clarity; that is the reason why this is coming up now.  
MR. NEKUIE:
I'm not in April 1994 yet.  I want him to talk about the atmosphere regarding security, particularly when he took up his post; in other words, towards the end of October 1993, when he took up his post in Kigali regarding the unit which he mentioned.  
THE WITNESS:
That was a period of total insecurity manifested by demonstrations, by political parties, armed robbery, infiltrations by elements of the RPF in the capital city.  And this situation turned for the worse after the arrival of the RPF units in Kigali -- that is, in December 1994.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the -- the witness.  
THE WITNESS:
I don't know whether I should continue talking about this episode.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	You talked about December 1994? 
A.	I beg your pardon -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.
THE WITNESS:
-- I meant 1993.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	So, two months after you being in that unit, is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct, Counsel.  
Q.	And under what circumstances did the RPF units arrive in Kigali? 
A.	The unit was a battalion; they came to Kigali within the context of the peace accords -- the peace accords signed here in Arusha to end the war between the RPF and the Kigali government.  
Q.	Before the arrival of RPF units, Mr. Witness, what were the resources which the gendarmerie in 
Kigali city had in order to deal with the atmosphere of insecurity which you mentioned? 
A.	I'd like to tell you that the mission of operational defence of the country had actually made them, the government, take people from the gendarmerie.  Therefore, with meagre means in personnel and equipment, the gendarmerie had liberty -- a scope of action which was supposed to establish law and order within Kigali city, more or less.  But apart from -- and through its ordinary mission, that is, routine mission, and due to the extraordinary mission, such as requisition -- being requisitioned to deal with political demonstrations, it was necessary for there to be a requisition of forces from the gendarmerie by the préfet of Kigali.  
Q.	After the arrival of the RPF units, Mr. Witness, did the gendarmerie continue having -- could -- 
did they -- were they able to cope with insecurity, given their meagre resources? 
A.	After the arrival of the RPF in the capital city, there were three forces; namely, the RPF; UNAMIR, which were UN peacekeeping forces which had come there to implement the Arusha Accords; and thirdly, the national gendarmerie.  The mode of operations changed.  Maintaining public law and order, actually, was given to UNAMIR on the basis of provisions governing the areas -- of the weapons secure area, which had been set up.  And RPF soldiers and Rwandan armed force -- armed forces soldiers could not actually get the weapons from that secure area without the authorisation of UNAMIR.  So the maintenance of law and order, as well as safety was given to UNAMIR in collaboration with the gendarmerie and the local police forces as stipulated by the accords.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And were they able to cope with the insecurity then, together? 
THE WITNESS:
It was not possible because there were some shortcomings on the part of UNAMIR; firstly, UNAMIR was supposed to work with the gendarmerie.  The liberty of action was actually on -- under UNAMIR.  UNAMIR could, or otherwise, carry out operations when it wanted.  And that was the case, I can give you examples.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you talk about UNAMIR being in Kigali and being in charge of maintaining law and order, do you remember the date from which the change of mission was effected from gendarmerie to the UNAMIR? 
A.	That was when they established the weapons-free area on the 24th of December 1993, if my memory serves me well.  
Q.	From that time onwards, units of the road safety company, were they without any activities assigned to them? 
A.	For them to carry out any operational activities, they had to wait for the military -- for soldiers from UNAMIR, as stipulated in the directive, setting up the weapons secure area.  And they had to come and ask the road safety company to go and carry out operations.  The company, actually at that time, dealt exclusively with checkpoints, and the same thing applied to other units dealing with patrols, searches, and so on and so forth.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's 5 o'clock.  We will then start tomorrow morning at 8:45, and we will then hear the continuation of your testimony, Mr. Witness.  

The Court is adjourned.
