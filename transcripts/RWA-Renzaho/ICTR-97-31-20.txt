MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness AWO, we are from now on in open session.  Please be careful so as not to reveal your identity.  The Prosecution will continue its examination-in-chief.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Can you recall how long after you left the orphanage the first rape occurred? 
A.	It lasted around one month and 24 days.  As soon as I left the orphanage, I could no longer move about; there were roadblocks.  
Q.	How frequently during that time were you raped? 
A.	I cannot tell you on how many occasions I was raped because it would take place every day. 
Q.	And, on a daily basis, can you estimate how many times people would come to your house and rape you? 
A.	They would take turns.  I cannot know how many times.  At some point I even asked them to kill me, but they refused.  
Q.	Do you know why you were the victim of this treatment? 
A.	They often said that they should go and taste what a Tutsi woman tastes like, if you have never had the opportunity to do so.  And I believe that was the reason why I was targeted.  
Q.	And during this time, where was your son? 
A.	My children were quite young.  I did not know where they were.  Sometimes they were in water tanks, sometimes hiding in trees.  I cannot tell you exactly where they were when I would be raped by these people.  I saw him in a tree, but I did not know he was there.  A bayonet had been put into my stomach, *****************************************************. 
Q.	When -- when did this happen?  
A.	I was still at my house when this happened, before I went to seek refuge in another location.  *********************************************************************************************************************And the Sisters of Charity were the ones who came to my assistance. 
Q.	Now, you said that you remained at home and you were repeatedly raped for about a month and 24 days, you said.  At what stage during that time was this incident with the bayonet?  Was it -- for example, was it at the beginning, in the middle, towards the end of that time? 
A.	It was towards the end of that period.  I would say that it was after one month and a half. That was when I was taken away with the bayonet in the lower part of my stomach.  I asked one of my attackers to kill me and he refused.  And he said that he would make sure that no other man would ever sleep with me; and he hit me with the bayonet in my stomach and also on my ankle.  And after that he left.  
Q.	Who was this attacker?  What type of person was he?  
A.	He was a soldier who had a firearm, on top of which was a bayonet.  I had been raped so many times that I could no longer close my legs.  And he said, "What we have just done is terrible, and I will make sure that no other man will ever touch you".  And that is when he used his bayonet.  
Q.	Was there anybody else around at that time? 
A.	People would always talk about me when they were passing by and saying -- talking about the fate I was handed. 
Q.	What about your son?  Do you know where he was? 
A.	He was a very boisterous boy and he was often in the trees.  I only noted that he was there when he started throwing stones at the dogs **************************************.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have heard quite some evidence now, and I understand we are approaching when the sisters are intervening.  Shall we go there?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
We can.  Yes, sir.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Can you explain, Madam Witness, how it was that you left that place? 
A.	I could no longer stand on my feet, so I started crawling. And the sisters who were picking up the dead bodies that were behind their compound heard people saying that there was a woman ***************************************, and that is how they came and took me with them.  They washed me and treated me and then they took me to the Sainte Famille church. 
Q.	And do you recall for how long you stayed at the Sainte Famille church? 
A.	When I arrived at the Sainte Famille church, the war was almost over.  After a few days the RPF carried out an operation at the Saint Paul centre where it evacuated refugees, and, subsequently to that, we had problems.  On that occasion, I saw Renzaho, Angeline, and Nyirabagenzi, as well as the priest. 
Q.	What do you mean by "We had some problems"?  Can you expand on that, please?  
A.	Many people were killed at that location.  There were evacuations towards the RPF-controlled areas or the government-controlled areas, and the young men were targeted throughout the period of the evacuations in order to prevent them from going to RPF-controlled areas.  
Q.	At what time of day was the RPF operation at Saint Paul when it evacuated refugees, do you remember?  
A.	We were at the Sainte Famille church, but the operation at Saint Paul took place during the night.  And the following morning, we heard that the evacuation of refugees from Saint Paul had taken place.  The next morning around 11, Angeline, Nyirabagenzi, Renzaho, and one priest called the young one, and whose name was, in fact, Munyeshyaka, arrived and moved around the Sainte Famille church checking who was there.  And, after that, they left.  
Q.	Can you tell us, please, who is Angeline that you refer to?  
A.	She was a teacher and she was the headmistress of Sainte Famille school. 
Q.	And do you know why she came to Sainte Famille with those other people who have mentioned?  
A.	Angeline used to say that there were Inyenzi at the Sainte Famille church who were causing problems to them.  That is what she would tell the préfet of the Kigali town.  She would tell him that the Inyenzi were causing problems.  
Q.	Where were you when you saw Renzaho and the others you have mentioned at Sainte Famille church, where in the complex of Sainte Famille church?  
A.	I was inside the church.  Some people would help me to walk and sometimes I could go outside.  And this is how I saw them moving around the place.  Subsequently, Munyeshyaka told us to prepare our hearts because the time had come and that we should sanctify ourselves.  After that he said Mass and he left.  Around 11, a great number of attackers arrived.  They were Interahamwe.  
Q.	To you, what did Munyeshyaka mean when he said, "the time had come and you must sanctify yourselves"?  
A.	He was, in fact, telling us that we were going to die.  He told us that we should prepare our hearts and sanctify ourselves and that our time had come.  
Q.	When the Interahamwe arrived, what did they do? 
A.	There were a great number of Interahamwe.  It was said that some had come from Gikondo, Kacyiru, and Remera.  And   they killed many people, especially men.  There were numerous dead bodies; and the bodies remained there for a number of days.  And, subsequently, it was said that they had to be taken away so that the UNAMIR soldiers would not see them.  So the dead bodies were taken to a garage in the parish.  And this priest who was called the young priest, told us that the dead bodies had to be taken away and that Renzaho would reward those who would do that, and that he would authorise the transfer of those who were going to pick up the bodies to Kabuga.  

Renzaho was in a place that was overlooking the area, and he was telling the Interahamwe to kill -- to kill many people.  And he would tell us, the woman, to applaud, because now all the Inyenzi had been exterminated.  
Q.	After that incident, Madam Witness, how long did you stay at Sainte Famille?
A.	After sometime the Inkotanyi arrived and they took control of the country, and that is how we were able to survive.  But before the arrival of Inkotanyi, there were young people hiding in water tanks or in the garden, and, subsequently, some of them were taken away.  They would not be killed at the church itself, they would be loaded onto a vehicle and taken elsewhere.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You said that Mr. Renzaho was in an area that was overlooking the place.  Did you see him yourself during the attack?  
THE WITNESS:
I saw him with my very eyes.  We were taken out of the church, telling us to show our identity cards.  So we would go out and pray and ask God to come to our assistance.  Even if you were to come to the church, I could show you where he was.  He was in a location which was overlooking the place.  The Interahamwe came down and started killing people.  And while the killings were taking place, he himself said, "Stop killing.  We have killed all the Inyenzi; and you, the women, you should clap because the Inyenzi have been exterminated".  And we did so in order to survive.  And I can tell that you more than a hundred people were killed at that location, but there were other people who were killed behind the church, and that I was not able to see.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And this attack lasted one day, less, or more?  
THE WITNESS:
The attack started at 11, and the attackers killed people, and then they finished their work and the dead bodies remained there.  Subsequently, Renzaho and the Interahamwe left very rapidly, and Munyeshyaka asked the people to pick up the dead bodies.  The dead bodies were put on a tarpaulin in the garage of the priests.  And the UNAMIR -- we were told that the UNAMIR soldiers would come and bring us some biscuits.  But there was nothing we could say.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And this happened in which month?  Can you recall?  
THE WITNESS:
It was almost towards the end of the war, perhaps in July, because after a while the Inkotanyi took over.  When they killed all these people, the Inkotanyi were already in Gikondo, Rebero and Remera.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	After the end of the war, Madam Witness, what state of the health did you find yourself in? 
A.	I have many health problems.  I have had problems in my womb because of one of the -- because of the bayonet that was put into my abdomen.  I have gone to see a number of doctors, and I was given authorisation to go and get treatment abroad.  But the Butare hospital, the CHK, decided that I had to be referred to another hospital abroad in order to receive treatment.

So I have many problems, and I wonder whether you can come to my assistance.  I have come with my documents and the doctors' reports.  And I have contracted a number of serious diseases.  
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  I have no further questions for you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are we ready to proceed with the following questions right away, Madam Witness?  Shall we continue or do you want a little break?  
THE WITNESS:
I believe it would be preferable for us to have a short break.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will do that.  

So the Court is adjourned for about 15-20 minutes.
(Court recessed from 0958H to 1025H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, we are in open session and you will now be cross-examined by the Defence.  
THE WITNESS:
Very well, Mr. President. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
I am obliged, Mr. President. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Good morning, Madam Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I wish to start my cross-examination by putting questions to the witness on her personal particulars.  And, for that reason, I wonder whether we should not sit in closed session for a couple of minutes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  We will do that for a couple of minutes.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 16 to 21] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 11 to 15 by Judith Baverstock)





















MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness AWO, we are now in open session and the Defence cross-examination continues.  

Which part of the witness statement do you want to draw our attention to?  In the French version, it's which number, please? 
MR. NEKUIE:
On page 3, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which line? 
MR. NEKUIE:
Line 11 -- lines 11 and 12.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(No interpretation)
MR. NEKUIE:
Exactly, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes? 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Madam Witness, in reference to that meeting, you told the Prosecutor the following:  "The following day, Renzaho convened a meeting at Nyirabagenzi, Odette's house, which meeting I attended."
A.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under separate cover) and even when Renzaho did not come, ***************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************.  
Q.	Madam Witness, but I just want to ask you a question following this portion of your statement that I've just read to you.  I want to know when you said, "I attended", would that mean that you attended that meeting by force or on your own initiative? 
A.	But, I have already told you ***************************************************************************************.  I told you that I was constantly raped by the police, the soldiers and the Interahamwes who lived in Nyirabagenzi's house.  They had all the time to do whatever they wished with me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Both the French and English version is neutral as to force here.  What is your point now, 
Defence Counsel?  There's no contradiction.  
MR. NEKUIE:
No, Mr. President, I put the question to the witness, she's answered and I'll move on to something else.  I was under the impression that when she said, "I attended", it was of her own volition.  But she explained that the Interahamwes took her there and I've taken note of that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And now there is an observation from the Prosecution?  
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, a different matter, at 10:55:32, I wonder if the first phrase there could be extracted.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the first four words in the sentence at 10:55:32, before the words "... and even when Renzaho did not come ..." shall be deleted and placed under seal.  

Thank you very much.  

Please do not transmit that, video booth.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Madam Witness, let's now focus on your stay at the Sainte Famille parish.  You stated that when you got there -- or, at least, while you were there, the RPF carried out an operation of evacuation of refugees at the Saint Paul pastoral centre, do you recall that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you stated that following that, there were several attacks launched by Mr. Renzaho and the persons whose names you mentioned against the Sainte Famille parish, is that correct? 
A.	Yes, they killed a lot of Tutsi.  
Q.	And when the question was put to you exactly when the attack -- during which you heard 
Mr. Renzaho's statement took place, you said it took place in the month of July; do you recall that? 
A.	Yes, I recall that, because when the Inkotanyi carried out their raid on the Saint Paul centre, the war was drawing to a close.  But I'm not able to give you the date because I was virtually dead, but I'm able to tell you that there were a lot of dead -- and I'm saying this as a person who was present at the site and who witnessed these unfortunate events.  
Q.	And since you were present at the site, Madam Witness, what did you observe the day after the operation carried out by the RPF at the Saint Paul pastoral centre? 
A.	Renzaho first arrived in the company of a teacher called Angeline, as well as Nyirabagenzi and Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka.  They went around and they were armed with pistols.  They checked the identity of those who were present.  After Renzaho's departure, Munyeshyaka conducted Mass, and he asked us to prepare and to sanctify ourselves because our time had come -- and subsequently, there was this attack that led to many casualties.  I am not in a position to give you any specific number, but there were many people who were killed on that occasion.  
Q.	And in the days that followed, Madam Witness, were there other incidents? 
A.	In the days that followed, their bodies were picked up and piled in the garage, and they came back to check.  I remember that the UNAMIR soldiers came and gave us biscuits.  But at that time, the bodies were in the garage, and subsequently, they came and abducted young men who had been able to hide in water tanks or in the bushes surrounding the area.  And, not long after, the RPF took control of the country.  There was no fighting; there were no killings after that attack against the Sainte Famille church.  But, he is present, he is aware of that -- he was present, he was there.  I do not know whether he's not providing any explanations when he was there.  
Q.	Madam Witness, when answering a question put to you by the Prosecutor on your stay in the Sainte Famille parish, you stated that you had continued being raped there repeatedly, despite the fact that you were pregnant.  Do you remember having made such a statement? 
A.	Yes, I did and it is the truth.  I was pregnant, and I was stabbed with a bayonet in my lower abdomen -- I still have the scar, and I can show it to you, if you so wish.  And it was at that point that *******************************************************.  You do know that those who were killed would remain there.  Their dead bodies would remain there and the dogs would feed on them.  
Q.	Yes, Madam Witness, my apologies for putting to you such questions, because I understand how difficult this can be for you psychologically.  But, unfortunately, such questions are necessary for purposes of clarification.  I simply wish to know, Madam Witness, whether you continued being raped during your stay in Sainte Famille? 
A.	No, I was filthy -- and there would be flies all over me.  I was wounded.  I had been stabbed with a bayonet -- I stank, and nobody could come near me.  And this soldier who stabbed me with a bayonet, did so saying that he was acting in that way so that no man would ever come close to me again.  And I told you that following this stabbing, I have had to suffer serious health consequences.  
Q.	Madam Witness, while you were at Sainte Famille, you did not note that on the 17th of June, the day after the operation by the RPF, all the refugees were evacuated towards the Mille Collines hotel? 
A.	My God, what are you telling me here?  In order to go to the Mille Collines hotel, one had to be a very important person.  Even if you had money, you would not be taken there easily.  I think you should put questions to those who were there and who know what happened.  Who evacuated such refugees?  Who could have taken the risk of evacuating anybody and get killed in the process?  I never heard such a thing, Counsel.  
Q.	So according to you, Witness, apart from those refugees who were killed during the attacks you recounted, all the other refugees remained until the town was freed by the RPF, is that what we are to understand? 
A.	Those who were not killed remained there.  Some had been told that they would be taken to Kabuga in the RPF-controlled area, but that never took place.  And the RPF arrived, and it is the RPF that found us where we had sought refuge.  And, for those of us who had been injured or were ill, we were transferred to the King Faisal Hospital. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness, and I wish to apologise for the questions I put to you and which led to your shedding some tears.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, Your Honours, this marks the end of the cross-examination by the Defence of this witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No need to tender any exhibit, I understand? 
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I do not believe it's necessary for me to tender any document.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Very good.  

Any re-examination? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Just a couple of questions, Your Honour.
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Madam Witness, you mentioned a boy called ********, who you said you could describe as your 
son -- although he wasn't your own child.  Did you witness his killing yourself? 
A.	I was present; he was put on board a four-by-four red vehicle with the others, and they were taken towards the Kiyovu area.  
Q.	You said that he was killed.  Did you actually see that? 
A.	There were gunshots and some young children climbed the wall to try and escape -- and some of them were killed.  And when they finished killing, they would take their bodies away immediately so that UNAMIR would not notice the dead bodies at the different locations.  
Q.	What about ********, did you see his body? 
A.	They were all killed in the neighbourhood.  My son was traumatised; he is now suffering from mental illness.  Jeanette was killed next to Kabuga's building.  So my son was the one who witnessed all the rape scenes from the place where he was hiding and he's now suffering from mental illness.  
MS. MELLUISH:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, the meetings that you described as a ruse in which it was mentioned that peace had been re-established, but in fact the aim was to let people come out of their hiding places, such meetings, how many were there approximately, 5, 10, 15? 
THE WITNESS:
I would say that such meetings would take place approximately every three days.  Three days would go by and then another meeting would be convened.  But, I saw Renzaho only on three occasions.  On the first occasion, at the Sisters of Charity; the second time at Nyirabagenzi's, and the third time at the Sainte Famille church.  But such meetings would be held frequently, and when people were asked to come out of their places of hiding, they would and they would be killed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, so you are now confirming -- and that was how I understood your evidence -- that 
Mr. Renzaho only participated in such meetings once, that is the evidence, isn't that so? 
THE WITNESS:
He would come, but he would not stay for long.  I told him that I saw him on three occasions, at the Sisters of Charity, at the Sainte Famille church and at Odette Nyirabagenzi's.  After his departure, the others would continue with their work. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But the meetings where one talked about calm, those meetings mainly took place in Odette's house, isn't that true?  Please answer that with a yes or a no.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, such meetings would take place at Odette's.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you only saw him at Odette's house once, isn't that also true? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I saw him, he was standing on the road.  And at the Sisters of Charity, I saw him on 
another -- on another occasion, and on the other occasion I saw him at the Sainte Famille church.  At the Sainte Famille church, I, in fact, saw him twice.  First of all, when he came to -- came with Angeline, and then I saw him once again when they started killing the people.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Witness.  Now, I'm still only interested in the meetings at Odette's house.  You saw him once at Odette's house.  Do you remember whether that was on the first meeting or in any of the subsequent meetings at her house? 
THE WITNESS:
It was during the first meeting that was held on the street facing Odette's house.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Madam Witness, this was the end of your testimony.  We would like to thank you for having come the long way to Arusha to testify and wish you a very safe journey home.  Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you very much indeed.  
THE WITNESS:
May I say something to the President of the Tribunal? 

I suffered health problems following the criminal acts that were conducted during the war.  I brought documents related to my health situation -- and, if possible, I wish to ask for the Tribunal's assistance to help me receive treatment.  I believe you are working in the field of human rights; I am very ill and I do not have the necessary resources to receive proper treatment.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, madam, for drawing our attention to the documentation you have in your possession.  You will now be accompanied out of the courtroom and the witness protection officer will be given those documents by you, and then we will see whether there will be a possibility of a follow-up.  
THE WITNESS:
But, you can give me a direct answer, Mr. President.  I have a medical report from the 
King Faisal Hospital, as well as another report from the CHK, and a report by the Butare hospital in Kigali -- I cannot receive treatment and I would like you to give me an answer before I leave.  

I would not want to say in the future that people refused to help me when you would -- you were willing to help me.  I made a sacrifice to come here and to face this man and show him that I'm still alive.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, you see, requests for help, we need to read them and look at them and look at what is available, and that is not something we can do in the courtroom now.  So that's why I asked you kindly now to give that to the witness protection officer, and the Tribunal, who has some possibilities to assist, will look into the matters.  So, rest assured that this will be looked into very carefully.  Thank you very much, Madam Witness, and we wish you a good day. 
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
This was the twenty-third Prosecution witness in 17 days since we started this trial on the 8th of January.  There are no other witnesses available in Arusha now.  

Mr. Moses? 
MR. MOSES:
Yes, thank you, Your Honour.  As Your Honour has indicated, I believe we've made very good progress in respect of the case.  So much so, Your Honour, that I can indicate that subject to the expert's testimony and two pending motions, the Prosecution -- the Prosecutor would be closing his case against the Accused. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much indeed.  

We have received your first motion this morning, drafted in French -- possibly not by you, but by Mr. Tredici.  And have you received this response, Defence?  Have you received this motion concerning the variation of the witness list, concerning Witness ADU? 
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  Yes, Mr. President, we received it this morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you will then simply respond in writing in conformity with normal procedure; that is the thinking, isn't it? 
MR. CANTIER:
We have started working on it, Mr. President, and you will have our response within the time allotted, that is to say, before the end of the week.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The purpose of this motion, according to what we read in paragraph 8, is to show the moral element -- the mens rea of the Accused.  Now, we are aware what this witness is going roughly to testify to, but why is this so important in the interest of justice?  Could you just explain that, given the fact that there have been other witnesses who may not have dealt with this issue, but who have approached general situations, and then it will be up to the Bench to decide.  What is meant by paragraph 8? 
MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, to date, we have attempted on a number of occasions to introduce as an exhibit the audiotape which we, as we have argued previously, we submit is the voice of the Accused during the period of the genocide telling another person to exterminate people.  

Now, yes, we cannot prove that as a result of that particular order, people were exterminated and therefore it doesn't -- there's nothing in the indictment itself which relates to that particular act.  However, they are words which we submit are words of the Accused that were spoken during the period of the genocide ordering the extermination of people.  

We don't know what the Defence case will be.  But, if the Defence case was perhaps along the lines that the Accused was doing all that he could to prevent the killings, then this is clearly a piece of evidence -- direct evidence, in the Prosecution's submission, pointing to the fact that such a defence goes -- does not -- is not in conformity with his direct words.  

Your Honours have, at this stage, not allowed us to produce the audiotape because of the concerns raised by the Defence -- and, obviously, concerns from the Bench as to where the tape was recorded and the circumstances that it was recorded.  At the moment, the only evidence before the Trial Chamber is that it was received from the ministry of rehabilitation in Rwanda, and there is no evidence as to how it got there.  The evidence of ADU will assist Your Honours in that respect, we trust, and therefore, lead to us being able to introduce that audiotape as an exhibit in the Prosecution case.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for that clarification and the Defence will then respond in due course in writing.  
MR. CANTIER:
Unless the Trial Chamber wishes me to say, in a nutshell, what my sentiment is on the 
matter, either it would be a new accusation -- a new indictment.  And my learned friend has just recognised that this could not be the case since that was not provided for in the indictment, as I had stated before you.  Or -- and this is the thesis of my learned friend today, the purpose to this document is to demonstrate the mens rea of the Accused.  Mr. President, Your Honours, this element, which is taken out of its specific context, cannot constitute an admissible piece of evidence, and this is what we are going to state and repeat -- the previous arguments we had submitted. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for those observations from both sides.  

Now, the next motion, any news about the medical certificate, Mr. Moses?  
MR. MOSES:
It did not arrive overnight, Your Honour, so I'm personally unaware of how long the administrative side of it takes to organise a video conference, if Your Honours grant the motion for a video conference.  That was really behind my suggestion yesterday, that perhaps we file the 
motion -- and file the report in a day or two when it arrives.  But clearly, I'm in your Your Honours' hands.  If Your Honours indicate that it won't take so long to -- to organise that from the registry side of matters -- and I think all Your Honours probably have more experience on that side of things than I do.  So, I'm really in Your Honours' hands.  I -- I can wait or I can file it today without the medical certificate -- also in French.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you do not receive it right away, you may wish to file it any moment.  

You have probably received a copy of the judicial calendar dated Monday this week through the CMS, and will have noted that in conformity with what we agreed upon in this courtroom, the next trial segment will start on Friday the 2nd of March and continue in the following days.  It will not start on Thursday the 1st because there is a need for one more day before we start.  So the first day will be Friday the 2nd of March and then into the next week to the extent required by the number of witnesses to be granted and the duration of each testimony.  But it's clear that we will not need the entire following week, so -- that's if we grant these two motions.  

And the next point then will be a discussion about the commencement of the Defence case.  Is the Defence in a position to indicate when this could be possible?  Let me say that, from an administrative point of view, we would seem to have courtroom space from the 16th of April onwards.  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, we contacted the witness protection section to know how much time would be required from when we handed the list of our witnesses for them to be able to bring the witnesses to the Tribunal.  And they're saying that, at the very least, two months.  

That is the first comment -- and that is independent of the will of the Defence.  As far as we are concerned, Mr. President, Your Honours, after the session we want to meet the potential witnesses.  That is where we are.  I did not know about this two-month time period.  The explanation was that for some witnesses, they -- they need to apply for travel documents, which explains this long period requested by the witness section.  

As far as we are concerned, Your Honour, the time period that we want to ask for is two months.  At the beginning, we talked about eight months, that is our -- about eight weeks.  That is our situation, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Today is the 7th of February and two months from now would be the 7th of April, and that's around Easter.  So would that imply that if we started, say the 16th of April, that that could be done? 
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I wish that we start the countdown from after the session, because the Defence has to prepare the next session, particularly regarding the expert witness.  

What the witness section protection told us, Mr. President, Your Honours, is that they need two months -- beginning from the day the Defence hands them the lists of witnesses that they wish to call.  And this is something I did not know until now.  So, the date you are referring to, 
Mr. President, appears very difficult to respect, because we would start from the end of the session -- that is, from about 8 March, that is when we'll start meeting our witnesses.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It may be that this is something we should be discussing more informally, but I would assume that it would be possible -- just to give a hint -- to start meeting witnesses in the weeks to come -- at least, some of them, in spite of the fact that there is this one expert witness left.  That is one consideration, but we could come back to that.  

And another issue is, it is true that the witness protection has this two-month deadline, but experience also shows that they can sometimes achieve results within less than that.  And, in addition, it's not obvious that you have to provide all your witnesses at the same time.  You could, for instance, provide them piecemeal, in groups, which would also facilitate the work of the witness protection unit.  

These are some of the considerations that could facilitate the work of everyone, but they are very technical and practical.  But I understand that at any rate, then, that may be the 30th of April would be more feasible -- Monday, the 30th of April.  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I have no idea at all because I don't know under what conditions the witness protection section is going to work.  I have just reported to you what they told me.  You have said that they could do better.  I do not control the situation.  

However, Your Honour -- Mr. President, Your Honours, as far as the work of the Defence is concerned, we are going to move as fast as possible.  I believe we have demonstrated that it's not just words from us, but more concretely, the work that we need to do today would request -- would require eight weeks for my team.  

I've heard you and you want us to give the lists of witnesses piecemeal to the witness protection section; I've understood that.  If that will help them, I'll be happy.  But the date you're proposing for now, I'm not too sure if we can respect that on account of what I've just said. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Because what you are saying now is that, first, you want two months, and then afterwards there may be a need for another two months.  So you are up to four months; that is the worst-case scenario. 
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, we should envisage the scenarios that are possible, not the worst.  If, on account of what you have said, we can give the registry, as we go along and as we get the agreement of the witnesses that are coming, we can pass on their names to them and we could envisage that we'll take off before this time frame of four weeks -- four months.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This was a useful discussion.  It is difficult to make a decision now based on the information available.  Let us simply say that the Bench's clear preference is to start this case in May as early as possible, but we will get in touch with the Defence and the witness protection unit to see what is possible, and we invite the Defence to informal consultations to see how this can be done in as smooth a way as possible.  And then a final decision will be made following consultations, is that okay? 
And let me simply say that the problem is that our courtroom schedule is very crowded when it gets closer to late June and July; that's why if we lose the momentum, it may have grave consequences.  And, in addition, one of the Judges at this Bench is sitting in another case in parts of June, which also complicates the matter, but we will sort this out.  

Any other matters? 
MR. MOSES:
In respect of the expert report, Your Honour, we filed the French version, which should have been served on the parties -- and in fact, I may -- it may be that that is the final version.  So there seems to be a little bit of confusion, but my latest understanding is, in fact, from the language section that the version that has been filed will not be revised.  So if I can just put that on the record.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All that remains now is to thank both parties for their professionalism.  As mentioned, we have heard 23 witnesses in 17 days; some of them were half days.  Even if we had to stop one week because of the Military I trial, it has been possible to bring this case to a completion subject to the two motions by today, since the 8th of January.  So again, thank you to both parties for the way they have conducted and contributed to the proceedings.  Thank you very much indeed.  

Warm thanks go to the registry staff for their never-failing efforts and quality work that is displayed everyday in the courtroom.  To the professionalism, integrity and efficiency of the interpreters.  And the quality and speed of the court reporters with a minimum of problems, if any at all.  You all made a tremendous contribution, thank you very much indeed.  

The Court is then adjourned until Friday the 2nd of March.  

Thank you. 
(Court adjourned at 1146H)
