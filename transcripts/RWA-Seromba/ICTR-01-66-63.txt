MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is called to order.  Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.  

Mr. Witness, good morning. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We would like to remind you that you are still under oath and that the Prosecutor will continue his cross-examination.  Please listen attentively to the questions and try to answer them in a concise and precise manner.  Thank you.  

Prosecutor, you may address the Court. 
MR. TOWNSEND: 
May it please the Court -- thank you very much, Your Honours.  
WITNESS FE56
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. TOWNSEND: 
Q.	Witness FE56, yesterday we were talking about your Rwanda statement of 19th May 2000?
 	And if I could call on Mr. Mwamasangula and ask him to show you the Kinyarwanda version of that 19th, May 2000 statement.  You notice that there's two typed pages and three handwritten pages.  If you can turn to the very last page and confirm for us, like you said yesterday, that your signature does, in fact, appear on the last page of the handwritten. 
A.	Thank you.  Yes, I can recognise my signature on the last page. 
Q.	And yesterday you told us that when you spoke to the authorities, you did your best to tell the truth and that was both to the ICTR and the Rwandan authorities; is that correct? 
A.	Thank you.  I would like to specify that yesterday when this document was given to me, we did not go through the procedure.  I was not able to read the document and avail myself of its contents.  I would like, therefore, to ask you to give me a few minutes for me to read the document and avail myself of its contents and then I will be able to answer the questions that you are going to ask me.  

Madam President, Your Honours, I would like, once again, to ask you to give me a few minutes, so that I can read this document.  This will enable me to answer the questions that will be put to me. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, you may read the document and then the Prosecutor will ask you questions. 
MR. TOWNSEND: 
Your Honours, there's one matter of housekeeping which I might address to you, if the witness could take off his headsets, I am not disturbing him. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, could you please remove your headset and carry-on reading the document? 
MR. TOWNSEND: 
With regard to the statement of 19th May 2000, the Court as an English and a French translation of which the second last question has an interpretation that is mistaken.  And the word in the second last question reads Athanase in the French and English versions.  However, in the original Kinyarwanda reads it appears "Anasthase" which is quite a different name and not that of the Accused.  So as to not put any evidence -- the second to the last question refers to the accused rather Anasthase, English and French version should be corrected.  I don't intend to lead any questions on that part. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness FE56, having taken a few minutes have you had an opportunity to read your statement 
	of 19th, May 2000? 
A.	Thank you.  I have just read the statement and I was, indeed, interviewed by the public prosecutor of the public prosecutor's office in Kibuye, but I would like to ask you, once again, to comment on the statement before the Prosecutor asks me questions on it. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, you may ask questions, please be brief. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  I will make sure that I am brief.  In fact, on the 
19th of May, at approximately 10 o'clock, the prosecutor of the former Ruhengeri province 
called Mbarushema (phonetic) - at any rate, I don't know if I am still allowed to give you names or 
not -- this public prosecutor went on a tour of the prisons in order to raise awareness amongst the prisoners and encourage them to confess.  It is on that date that he came to Kibuye prison.  When he arrived at the prison, we were taken outside.  And he chaired the meeting during which he raised -- he attempted to raise awareness amongst the prisoners.  That was the time at which we were encouraged to ask him questions.  And one of the prisoners asked him -- he was one of my fellow detainees and he was from Kivumu -- I don't want to give his name, but if you want me to, I could give his name in closed session -- the said detainee spoke to the public prosecutor and leveled accusations against me, saying that I was one of the people from Kivumu commune who were stopping other prisoners from accepting the confession and built guilty plea procedure.  He said that I was encouraging prisoners not to accept to testify in front of the former authorities of the country within the Kivumu commune.  Those authorities had sought refuge and had left the country and gone into exile in countries such as the Congo.  And so it was I, in his opinion, who was stopping those prisoners in telling the truth.  I am talking about the role of the authorities played in the determination of charge within Nyange parish.  The public prosecutor from Ruhengeri immediately asked one of the communal policemen who was there, to take me into a cell within the prison itself.  And at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, a person who was in charge of guarding the prison took me out of that place and led --or took me to Kibuye public prosecutor's office where I was interviewed.  After having read this document that I have been handed today, I noted that some of the statements included in the document notably some of the responses to the questions are not, in fact, my answers.  They are answers that were provided and drafted down by the person who was interviewing me.  So every time that I didn't answer as he wanted me to, he would write down the information that he wanted to and not the information that I gave him.  After the interview he did not read my statement back to me.  And that is quite common in Rwanda, prisoners are obliged or compelled to state what the authorities want them to without allowing them to tell the truth.  So what I would like to say, Madam President, Your Honours, yes, I did append my signature to the statement, but I didn't know I had not availed my self of its contents.  But now that I have read it, I realise that the public prosecutor of the former province of Kibuye answered to some of the questions himself, and then said that those answers were mine.  So I would like you to use this document carefully and to the best of your judgement. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think, that you have come to the crux here, and I think we can move on with our question now. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I just want to conclude by saying that I know that the Prosecutor got this document from the Rwandan authorities and I would like to say that he should not base his case on this document.  And that the allegations or accusations levelled against Seromba, he indeed, committed them. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, you may address the Court with your questions. 
MR. TOWNSEND: 
Thank you, Your Honours. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness, I would like you to turn to page 2 of the Kinyarwanda text, and if you could follow along with me. 
MR. TOWNSEND: 
Your Honours, I am reading from the sixth question.  In French it says; "Athanase Seromba." 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness, can you turn to page 2 of the typed French version so that you can follow.  I am reading from what appears on the top of your page 2 in Kinyarwanda and I will quote. Question: "Father Athanase Seromba is alleged to have been involved in the massacre of those people."  Answer:  "I cannot testify to that.  He was a priest.  It is said that he might have given the go ahead to bring the machine for demolishing it."   Next question. "Do you know anything about the allegation that he took part in the meetings relative to the massacre of those people?" Answer:  "There was a security committee composed of the bourgmestre, the criminal investigations officer and Athanase Seromba."  You would agree with me that that's what appears in your statement of 19th May 2000?" 
A.	Thank you.  Yes, I see that passage in the statement I gave on that date.  However, regarding the first question you can see that what I said was that I couldn't confirm that this is what I said.  The Prosecutor added his own words saying that -- it was said that he was the one who had given the green light that the bulldozer be brought.  That is why I said that these are his own words and not mine.  Regarding the question as to whether he participated in meetings.  Let me say very briefly that this is not the first time I am questioned on this so called security committee.  I stated that there was a security committee.  And I believe I pointed out that the member of that security committee were the bourgmestre, the IPJ and Joseph Habiyambere who was the magistrate.  I also gave the name of Telesphore Ndungutse who was chairman of the MRND party and Anastase Rushema chairman of the MRND party.  Those persons were advisors in that committee and I believe that I did not mention anywhere that 
Father Athanase Seromba was a member of that security committee in Kivumu commune.  You would very well understand that the prosecutor of Kibuye did not mention the names of persons I had given as being members of that committee.  He merely noted down certain persons and added Father Seromba's name whereas I never made any reference to him. 
MR. TOWNSEND: 
Your Honours, at this time I would move to admit FE56's statement to the Rwandan authorities of 19th May as the next Prosecutor's Exhibit P. 52, under seal.  I have a French and English translation which I have made myself, the corrections, the second to the last question, in blue ink, and if the copy in the hands of the witness would join that as the Kinyarwanda versions, again those are the handwritten and typed in Kinyarwanda.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you ask the witness whether all he did was sign the Kinyarwanda manuscript?  That he did not add anything, he merely signed.  Could that question be put to the witness?
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  All I did was to append my signature to that document. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  

I will now turn to the Defence Counsel.  Do you object to the admission of this document?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
No objection, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This document dated 19th May 2000, is admitted into evidence as Prosecutor exhibit -- could someone give me the exhibit number.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
it is P. 52.
 
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
It's P. 52, under seal.  This document will also be placed under seal.
(Exhibit No. P. 52, admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, please proceed. 
MR. TOWNSEND: 
This is a statement of 11th May 2000. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Before we deal with this document, I would like to point out that Exhibit P. 52 is in three versions.  That is P. 52, A, B, and C, that is in three versions. 
MR. TOWNSEND: 
Thank you, Your Honours.  The document being circulated is FE56's statement to the Rwandan authorities of 11th January 2000.  The Witness has his Kinyarwanda handwritten original before him and I will give the references which are K0334200, French is K0360357 and English K0367024. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness, if you can please look at the second page of what you have in front of you, the Kinyarwanda version and tell us if your signature appears below your written name, yes or no?  
A.	Thank you.  The signature below my name is, indeed, mine.  However, I would like to make a commentary once more on this document because from looking at the date on which this document was prepared, I find that it was prepared before I gave my statement in the year 2000.  Furthermore, it was prepared before I confessed and pleaded guilty of charges regarding the events in Nyange -- regarding my involvement in the events in Nyange.  In my opinion, I believe the Prosecutor should not rely on such a document as a piece of Prosecution evidence against *Athanase Seromba.  Since Seromba never played any role in the events in Nyange. 
Q.	Witness FE56, if you can look at the second question, which has a small tick mark on the margin and confirms of being -- and it read as? 
MR. TOWNSEND: 
And for the interpreters, I am starting at "A quell". 
BY MR. TOWNSEND: 
Q.	Question.  "On what date did people kill at Nyange church? Were you there at that moment?"  

	Answer:  "I believe it was on 16th April l994.  I was at home".  

	Do you recall making that statement on 11th January 2000?  
A.	Thank you.  Regarding this question that was put to me, it is written here that I said that I believe -- I said, I believe.  But I, instead, asserted that events occurred on the 16th of April. 
Q.	Now if you can look at the next question which I have checked which is the seventh question, if you can confirm that it reads as follows: -- 
MR. TOWNSEND: 
This is the question in French for the interpreters.  It starts.  (Inaudible)
BY MR. TOWNSEND: 
Q.	And I will quote. "Tell us all the places in the company testify Criminal investigations officer with the attention to kill all the people who did not reason as you.  Answer:  I went to no place with criminal investigations officer Fulgence (phonetic).  All trust had been withdrawn from any person who had accompanied people to the church".  You recall making that statement on 11th January 2000?  
A.	Thank you.  Yes, I assert that I made those statements.  But I have explained to you that during that period when I made those assertions -- when I made those statements, I was still keeping things secret.  I hadn't started telling the truth.  That's why I requested that this document should not be considered as a legally binding document.  And that it should not be used to corroborate the allegations that are charged against Athanase Seromba.  

Let me insist.  He never played any role in the events he is alleged to have been involved in. 
Q.	So, if I understand your testimony, there were statements that you made in your 11th January 2000 statement that were not the truth, whereas in your 19th of May 2000 statement, those statements were not your own but rather those that someone else wrote on the document you signed is that your evidence? 
A.	I will answer this question as follows:  I just told you that when I answered questions of the 
	11th of January 2000, I did not have the courage to tell the truth then, but I have told you that in the statement of the 19th of May, the answers therein were those given by the IPJ of Kibuye.  He attributed to me answers I never gave him. 
MR. TOWNSEND: 
I have nothing further in terms of the question.  But I would move to admit this 11th January 2000, statement as Prosecutor Exhibit P. 53, under seal, again French and English. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Does the Defence object to the admission of the document?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
No objection, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  This document dated 11th January 2000 is admitted into evidence as Prosecution Exhibit No. P. 53A, B, C that is the three documents and this document will be placed under seal.  
(Exhibit No. P. 53A, P. 53B, P. 53C admitted, under seal) 

Counsel for the Prosecutor has ended his cross-examination.  Does the Defence intend to re-examine the witness, if so, Counsel you have the floor.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Madam President.  I have just a few questions for the witness.  They won't take much time.  

RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness FE56, good morning.  
A.	Good morning. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam President, Your Honours, I have had a copy of the document which the Prosecutor admitted yesterday as P.51 to the witness.  I would like to use the French version in my re-examination of the witness.  I don't know whether it is necessary for me to give a copy of this document to the Prosecutor, but I would like to point out to the Bench that I have only a few passages in this French version that I would like to show the witness, and then make remarks as Defence Counsel.  I don't know whether I can proceed to re-examination of the witness without disclosing this document before-hand to the Prosecutor. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, do you have this document that is P. 51?  Do you have this document? 
MR. TOWNSEND: 
(Inaudible) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well then.  Please proceed with your re-examination counsel for the Defence.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
I thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness FE56, on the 13th of March 2003, when the investigators of the OTP of ICTR, met you and had you sign the document shown to you by the Prosecutor yesterday, did they leave a copy of this document with you? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, on that date that is the 13th of March, the investigators did not leave a copy of the statement I gave them with me.  I requested them to give me a copy of that statement but they answered by saying that they did not have the means of leaving a copy of it with me. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE56.  Witness FE56, can you tell this Chamber the distance between the Nyange parish Canton court.  That is the Canton court, the distance from the Canton court to Nyange parish? 
A.	I thank you.  If I were to give an estimate of the distance from Nyange parish and the Canton court, I believe it is about 800 metres. 
Q.	Can you also tell the Chamber whether it is possible when you are standing at the Canton court to see what is happening at the Nyange church? 
A.	Thank you.  Normally, when you are at the Canton court you cannot see the parish because there's a forest between the two locations but when you leave the parish and go down 
a bit, there are houses.  All you can hear is noise and shouts coming from the parish.  I remember stating this when I was asked the question whether I could see people doing a certain number of things at parish.  What I am saying therefore is that you cannot see people at the parish but you can hear what is happening there. 
Q.	Thank you for these clarifications, Witness FE56.  I will show you part of the statement you allegedly gave the ICTR investigators on this issue.  The Kinyarwanda interpreters will translate it to you as we go along.  This is what you say on page 17 "I left alone to go to the commune. The bourgmestres had not yet returned.  While at the Canton Court, it is possible to observe what is happening at the church.  I could see that the Tutsi refugees were resisting attack led against them until the time when a man called Anjarukara (phonetic), went up to the business centre to throw a grenade at the refugees who had succeeded to repel Interahamwe up to the road leading to the business centre.  And later on you say that I saw attackers around Kayishema and Ndungutse.  My question to you as follows Witness E56:  Do you think you told the investigators that from the Canton Court where you were, you could see the scene.  Do you think those are words which you uttered on that day? 
A.	Thank you.  When I met the team of investigators from the Office of the Prosecutor, I explained to them that when you are at the Canton court, you cannot see people in the parish and its surroundings because there's a forest between the two locations.  What I told them was rather that this was the information I had received.  I told them that I heard about those events when I went up with Kayishema to the parish.  That was when I heard about what had happened and I stated that I could hear the noise Butare regarding this incident of someone who went up the roof of a shop to throw a grenade that was the information I received when I got to the parish. 
Q.	Further on in the last paragraph of this statement in the statement that you allegedly made.  I read as follows:  Last page, page 6 of 7.  "During the month of April 1994 before the death of President Habyarimana, I saw 
Father Seromba celebrating mass in Nyange parish.  I also saw him at the communal office when he came to visit Bourgmestre Ndahimana.  My question, Witness FE56; is as follows:  Do you think that that is the statement that you made to the investigators that day? 
A.	Thank you.  Regarding this last sentence, I remember very well that I told the investigators from this Tribunal that before President Habyarimana's plane was shot down, I had seen Father Seromba celebrating mass.  To go as far as to say that I saw Father Seromba visiting the bourgmestre after the president's death, I don't know.  That might have been the interpreter who made a mistake.  The Rwandan or Kinyarwandan interpreter.  I never made such a statement.  I never said that I had seen Father Seromba visiting the Bourgmestre Ndahimana.  So I do not agree with regard to the visit. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE56.  It should be understood then that the statement in this statement does not reflect what you said to the investigators of the Prosecution team on that day? 
A.	That's right.  Regarding that visit what was noted down in that statement has nothing to do with what I had actually said. 
Q.	Thank you witness.  Yesterday in response to a question from the Prosecutor you said that this interview took place in the solidarity camp, is that what you said yesterday? 
A.	Thank you, but I think I have already answered that question.  However, I expected him to ask me another question.  It is true that the investigators from the Tribunal came to see me at the solidarity camp.  And yesterday I expected him to ask me a question about this solidarity camp.  At the beginning of the interview they asked me questions about my current situation or status that is about Gitarama prison.  I also expected to be asked questions about the solidarity camp.  If he has any other questions to ask me about the solidarity camp, if he wants to know why I did not leave the solidarity camp in order to go home, the reason why I was allowed to take part in the solidarity camp and it is also attached to the reason why I was not released.  I am ready to answer questions of that nature. 
Q.	Thank you Witness.  I am asking you the following question.  Why did you not leave the solidarity camp in order to go home instead of going to Gitarama prison?  
A.	Thank you.  ***************************************************************************************.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
One minute, please.  Counsel, could this question not reveal the identity of the witness?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
It is possible, Madam President.  But in view of the fact that it is the last question that I intend to put to him, I wonder whether it was necessary to go into closed session whether it wouldn't be too much but if you think that the Bench thinks that we should go or move into closed session then -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, could you answer this question without giving any details that might reveal your identity?  If you can answer the question without giving any names.  Well, for this one outstanding question we are not ready to move back into closed session.  So, Witness, if you could answer briefly without giving us any names maybe you could answer these question. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  I am going to try.  I don't know if I shall manage, but I should try.  ******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, -- Counsel, excuse me. The witness is giving information that could very easily identify him.  Is this question really necessary for the Defence case? 
MR. NEKUIE:  
I am going to ask him a far simple question, Madam President.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness FE56, could you quite simply tell us whether there's a link between the fact that you were sent back to Gitarama prison and the interview that you had in 2003 with the investigators of the Tribunal?  Could you give us a precise and concise answer, please? 
A.	Yes, there is a link and I was getting to that.  I don't know if you could just be patient for just two minutes for me to be able to explain this report. 
Q.	Witness FE56, you should not go into details, you should please explain the report in simple terms without going into details because this could disclose your identity? 
A.	********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************* 
Q.	Witness FE56, I have to cut you short, I am afraid, because you are revealing your identity.  But we understand what you said and I would like to thank you on behalf of the Defence team for having come to testify before the Courts.  I would like to thank you, and that was my last question, Witness FE56.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam President, Your Honours, before coming to the end of my redirect, I would like to ask the Chamber to enter into evidence the French version P.51A, with the notes and comments that the witness and Defence have provided as a result of the questions put to him now, and also underline the passages or excerpts that the witness said were not his. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Nekuie, we have not received from you notes on this document or from the witness, in fact. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
I have noted down those sections or excerpts on which I questioned him.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, that's part of the record.  So I don't think it's necessary for that to be entered as an exhibit.  If you had noted down comments on the document itself, that is to say, something that the witness might have also written down in writing, fine, but that is not the case.  He answered the question and this is all in the record. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
In that case, I would withdraw my request, Madam President, and I would just like to say that I have finished with my redirect.
  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Nekuie.  It should be redacted from the record those specific details as to his role in the committee, that he talked about.  They should be redacted from the record in the interest of protecting the witness.  Witness, you have now reached the end of your testimony before this Chamber.  We would like to thank you for testifying before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and we would like to thank you for answering the question that we put to you.  We would like to wish you a safe journey home.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.
(Witness withdrawn)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness FE56, should be shown out.  I don't know whether we should bring in FE13 or FE32 because I can see that Mr. Moses is amongst us today.  So maybe we could continue with the cross-examination of Witness FE32, otherwise, we could start with FE13.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Yes, good morning, Madam President.  We haven't quite reached the cross-examination of FE32, we are still continuing with the examination-in-chief of that witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So, please show Witness FE32 in.  

Good morning, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you feeling better this morning?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I am feeling better.  I think we can carry on.  I have a slight problem, but I don't think it would get in the way of the proceedings. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You told us the last time that you were testifying as an unprotected witness, do you still want to do so?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours; I have no problem with testifying as an unprotected witness.  The most important thing is for me to tell the truth and that I help you to discovery the truth. So I have no problem in appearing here as an unprotected witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  Mr. Monthé, I think that you are conducting your examination-in-chief of this witness.  I think you have a few questions outstanding.  So you can give us the name of the witness. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Thank you, Madam President.  I do, indeed, have a number of outstanding questions for this witness because as you know, we adjourned as he had health problems and also because the Prosecutor, Jonathan Moses was away and he is now amongst us and again I would like to say hello to him.
ANASTHASE NKINAMUBANZI
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, Anasthase Nkinamubanzi, good morning? 
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	I note with pleasure that you are in form this morning and I hope that we will be able to continue? 
A.	Yes, I am ready, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness, when we parted company last time, I was using a number of documents, do you remember these documents? 
A.	Yes, I do, Counsel. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, I would like to know whether it is necessary for those curtains to be drawn since, of course, we are in open court. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, I was just about to say something about that.  Could the Court clerk, please, pull the curtains back so that we could see the witness?  Thank you very much, Court Clerk.  

Mr. Monthé, you may address the Court. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, Nkinamubanzi, Anasthase, before talking about the document in question, I would like first and foremost to ask you some interim question.  I must say that I am slightly puzzled on the number of the bulldozers that were on site in Nyange parish on the 16th of April.  Those bulldozers that demolished the church, was there one or was there more than one bulldozer on the site because we still haven't enlightened the Court on that question.  
A.	Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  I told you that I had come here to help you establish the truth.  The horrendous act that is the demolition of the church was accomplished with one bulldozer and one bulldozer only.  I know that some farmers are not capable of making a distinction between a lorry and a bulldozer, but there was only one bulldozer and it was a 1966 model. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You also told us and I would like you to confirm this point -- you said that you were not protected by a door; is that correct?  You were not protected by a door while the church was being demolished, is that correct? 
A.	I would like to specify by saying that I was not protected in any manner.  I told you that the bulldozer -- there was a door, a metallic door.  So, I didn't need protection as such.  That never happened, but I wouldn't be in a position to explain that I was not the only driver.  We were more than one driver.  So, I don't know whether amongst the other drivers there might have been one of them that used that door, but I can't imagine how anybody could have been protected because the bulldozer was doing that job. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, I would like to ask you if you confirm before this Chamber that the different statements that you gave, whether it be to African Rights Association, Human Rights Association or to the Judicial authorities of your country and then at a later stage to the investigators of this Tribunal, whether the statements were given freely and willingly, could you confirm that? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, as I have always explained.  When I was arrested, I am here now, 
	I am under oath and I am ready to tell you the truth and nothing but the truth and as a result, I would like to say that in all the statements that I gave, I was under pressure.  You can't imagine the pressure and I couldn't escape it.  I know that I gave a statement to the investigators of this Tribunal and I know that there was one person who came to find me on a number of occasions since sometimes I was unwell, and he said to me; "We would like you to help us in the trial."  And every time questions were put to me on the subject to Father Seromba.  So you can image the situation that I was in.  I was in prison and I told you that I had been taken to a trench.  So, I don't know whether the fact that I had a white person in front of me, in fact, made me feel any more uncomfortable.  I am here now.  I am under oath and I think you should take that seriously.  I can see, Madam President, here, in front of me, in a red and white and black lobe, so if somebody asks me what colour a lobe was, well, I could tell them and if I said that it was a different colour, it would be a lie.  And that applies also to Father Seromba.  I cannot bring allegations against him on things that he didn't do. 
Q.	Witness, could you please answer my questions without digressing too much.  That would enable us to move forward rapidly.  Witness, let me ask you about something during our last interview, you referred to a certain préfet whose name I wouldn't give.  You said that he was a préfet of one of your préfectures and that he had brought pressure to bear on you, considerable pressure to bear on you? 
A.	Thank you.  I believe it is necessary to go back on that issue.  I don't know whether what I told you, you do not consider it as the truth.  What happened after SONARWA company.  That person had led me to that location and he came the second time to tell me what I had to tell members of African Rights.  I do not know why you want to dwell on this fact.  I told you that I was led to a trench and I related to you the acts of violence I was subjected to.  Today I am here, I am appearing before this Chamber to refute what was written down by African Rights and the other information that was broadcast by various radio stations, stating that Father Seromba had committed offences, offences he is charged with. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness for this clarification.  Just one last question regarding that personality.  You told us on the last occasion, and I would like you to confirm this, that while he brought pressure to bear on you and while that person asked you to make allegations against Father Seromba, that person was from the Catholic Church, is it?  
A.	I think I have explained everything to you.  I said it was Captain Noel (phonetic) who had saved my life.  And when that person came to meet me in person, that wasn't up to a week later, that person incited me to say that Father Seromba had played a role in the demolishing of the church.  Because if 
	Father Seromba was convicted of that offence, it would be the same for the Catholic Church because his servant, Father Seromba, would have been found guilty of certain acts.  I don't know whether they simply wanted to get damages from the Catholic Church.  You would understand why somebody came to meet you -- to take you to a trench and then less than a week later he comes to you in prison and tells you what to say.  It is as if someone came here to twist your arm and forced you to say something, would you refuse to say what he wants you to say?  You would say whatever he wants you to say to save your skin. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Monthé, I have the impression that the witness has answered those questions but I believe you did not ask him how many days he spent in that trench.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, I could reword the question?  But I believe he talked of two weeks, if I remember correctly.  I am putting these questions to the witness, Madam President because I have other question or other documents to show the witness and before presenting them to the Chamber, I would like the witness to confirm what he said before we deal with them in this Chamber.  In this regard 
Madam President, I would request the registry to come and pick up these documents so that we use them to bring the truth to light.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registrar, please, could you assist the Defence Counsel.  Counsel Monthé, do you have enough copies for everyone including the interpreters?  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, I could have some photocopies made for the interpreters but I do not like for these documents to be read out.  These documents are already in evidence, they have been disclosed by the Prosecutor under K0509550 but I believe, the Prosecutor is signaling to me that he has an additional copy.  Perhaps he could give hand it to -- I haven't quite understood what you are signaling 
Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. TOWNSEND: 
-- documents to which I do not have copies but I do not -- 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, relying on what the witness has just said, I would like to point out that regarding this person we are dealing with whose name I cannot mention, you would find that there's a letter of the 11th of January 1997, that letter is from Amnesty International, Tokyo.  There's a letter of the 
2nd of January, 1997 prepared by Amnesty International Belgium, K0338940.  That is the document of Amnesty International Belgium.  As for Amnesty International, Tokyo document, it's K050524.  As for the documents by Amnesty International, United States of 15th January 1997, its number, K0338724.  And lastly, we have the document by Amnesty International of 15th January 1997 K058525.  And my question to the witness is as follows, Madam President.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	The personality in the préfecture you are referring to, do you know whether he caused a certain number of religious personalities to be arrested -- a certain number of clergies to be arrested? 
A.	Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  In answer to this question whether that authority caused religious personalities to be arrested while we were in prison, while I was in prison, I was with 
	Father Kayiranga and Nturiye.  I do not know the person who arrested them.  I simply know that they were arrested but I don't know who caused those two priests to be arrested.  What I know is that during my trial those priests were there.  I therefore do not know whether they were arrested by the préfet or not. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, at this stage of my examination-in-chief, I would like to have the four documents -- the three documents I beg your pardon, admitted into evidence as Defence Exhibits, if there's no objection from the Bench, of course. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for Prosecution, you have the floor.  Do you have any objections to the admission of these documents into evidence?  
MR. TOWNSEND: 
Yes, I do because none of these documents refer to this witness.  This witness is not being referred
to -- showing these documents, they have nothing to do with that they specify -- they refer to 
Father Kayiranga and Father Nturiye.  So I don't see how this particular witness can tender these documents on what I am seeing today. I mean that's my only comment, Your Honours. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, the Defence's concern is to indicate following what the witness has just said to us here that he was called to give evidence for Father Seromba in person and against the Catholic Church.  So this document which I want to tender into evidence you have the evidence of humanitarian organisation right into that person to tell him that the religious persons are ill-treated.  So this document is relevant because it justifies the fact that during that period the authorities had the obvious intention of attacking religious officials.  That is the relevance of tendering this document into evidence. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we have some problems regarding the admission of these documents into evidence because they indeed deal only with Father Kayiranga.  Furthermore, the witness was not examined on these documents.  Perhaps you could use these documents subsequently, but for the time being we do not see the link of between those documents and this witness. 

MR. MONTHÉ: 
I thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, I will now use the information bulletin number 2 of African Rights to examine this witness.  Madam President, I distributed a document which was an extract from the following publication from this book, which I would like to show the Chamber.  Perhaps the registrar could assist us to distribute this document. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registrar, please could you assist Defence Counsel. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, I had told you that the book that has just been shown you, deals with all the events that occurred in Rwanda in 1994 generally, indicating specific chapters concerning Kibuye préfecture.  I had told the Chamber that the charge against Father Seromba, priest from the parish in Rome is from this document that you have just looked at.  That is an information bulletin, indeed.  I would like to use this document focusing on the words of that bullet which was tendered into evidence by the Prosecutor.  I don't remember the number of that exhibit.  I believe the registrar can help us to find the number.  I am being told it is P. 5.  Prosecution P. 5.

My first question, Madam President, if the Chamber is ready, concerns page 16 of the document that was disclosed to me.  And I would like to the witness to tell us whether he uttered those statements on that page.  And with your leave, Madam President, I will lead this passage slowly so that it should be translated to the witness.  Madam President, we are on paragraph 4. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness Kanambazi, listen carefully to what I will read out to and tell us whether you did indeed utter those words.  "Father Seromba who was -- "
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could the Defence Counsel show us -- indicate exactly where he is reading from, Madam President. 
MR. TOWNSEND: 
If I can assist the English translator.  The English version it's also on page 16, and it's the third paragraph of the English version. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor, and thank you to the interpreters.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ: 
Q.	Let me start reading again to avoid any possible errors. Father Seromba who was in favour of that solution said the following and I quote.  "They should be destroyed so that we can get ride of the enemy.  When the enemy was no longer there we can build another.  And he later on said that Kayishema went to (inaudible) office and brought the two bulldozers.  Anastase Nkinamubanzi aged 38 from Kibilira descent was one of the two drivers.  The other was a Zairian.   Anastase Beshimye and as he refused to bulldoze the church but he said Seromba made him afraid.  Father Seromba said the following and I quote: "There are many Christians abroad.  That church -- this church will be rebuilt in three days."  Witness Nkinamubanzi.  Did you utter these words to representatives of African rights?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The witness is speaking without having turned on his microphone. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  I see that the statement in this passage are contradictory. You see that Seromba utter his statement even before the bulldozers arrived.  In that case, who was he talking to and you state that I met -- do you mean that I met Father Seromba even before the bulldozers arrived?  This is not possible.  When you take an oath you cannot say just anything.  I am not here to joke.  Let me point out to you that I went to Vungu (phonetic) -- that I did not go to Vungu to get those bulldozers because I was working in Rubengera.  Anyone who says that I went to Vungu is accusing Father Seromba falsely.  The persons who went to get the bulldozers in Vungu are well known.  Reference is made to them be it in this Tribunal or in Kivumu commune.  I have told you that I was taken to the parish.  I was forced to go to the parish.  You asked me not to go into details but what I know is that the Rwandan authorities do not want to admit that I was forced, because if they accept that I was not forced, they would not be able to justify what they are saying.  I thank you. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:	
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, I would like to proceed but I can see that it is now time for break.  Perhaps it would be proper to respect our schedule. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Indeed, Counsel, we will adjourn for a few minutes because it is break time.  The proceedings stand adjourned. 
(Court recessed at 1100H)
(Pages 1 to 17 by Judith Kapatamoyo)












(Court resumed at 1130H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:	
We will resume our session.  

Counsel Monthé, you may address the Court.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:  	
Q.	Witness Nkinamubanzi, I would like to carry on using the document that I talked about at the beginning of this session, that is, the second document that was given to us, and enter it as an exhibit under No. P.  5.  I would like to ask the interpreting booth to refer to page 18 of this document, at the end of the last paragraph of that page.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
Madam President, the Kinyarwanda booth does not have the document.  Could we please have the document?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Well, this document is in the case file.  I don't have a copy, I am afraid. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court clerk, do you have a copy of this document, please?  Very well.  I think that the Kinyarwanda booth now has the document in its possession.  Counsel Monthé, could you tell us which sentence you want us to concentrate on and what page we need to refer to, please?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, with pleasure, Madam President.  As I was saying, we are going to refer to page 18 of the document of the Charge Sheet No. 2, and it is the last page of that document and I am going do read slowly from this document in order for it to be interpreted to the witness before I ask my question.

I quote from the document:  "Seromba carried on killing refugees after the church was demolished as ********* testified.  Those people who were still breathing in the rabble were finished off by Kayishema and Seromba using a small hoe and this hoe was called Urufunyi.  I saw them killing these people when I went to go and recuperate those objects that were in the debris.  I saw them killing people with this Urufunyi hoe.  Kayishema was wearing jeans and Father Seromba was wearing a pair of black trousers." End of quote.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ: 
Q. 	Witness Nkinamubanzi, you, who were on the location; did you see Father Seromba finish off survivors using the Urufunyi hoe?  
A.	Madam President, Your Honours.  I would like to say that before this Tribunal, if witnesses were honest, and if they came with the aim to telling the truth, people say that these trials take an eternity to complete, but I think they would be completed more rapidly if witnesses told the truth.  How could people dare to say that Seromba was finishing off survivors with small hoes -- with a small hoe?  Those survivors who were covered with debris and rabble?  If anybody dare to say that before this Tribunal, that is terrible.  I think that you should not take this as the truth. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I would respectfully like to ask the Chamber to refer to page 19 of this document; paragraph 6, which starts with, "After the destruction of the church," it is page 18, in fact, in my version.  If everyone has found the page, I will start reading, and I quote: "After the destruction of the church, all the workers were rewarded, including the Interahamwe, who had come from Gisenyi and Gitarama.  During an interview with African Rights, the driver, Anastase admitted that he and the others had been paid by Father Seromba.  According to Nyitegeka, there was a collection."  End of quote.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:  
Q.	Witness, did you make this statement to African Rights?  
A.	Thank you.  When I came to appear before this Tribunal, I swore that I would tell the truth.  I took the oath, but what I said beforehand was not accepted, but I am now appearing before this Tribunal in order to confirm that I did not receive a reward from Father Seromba.  There is an old man by the name of Edward, who explained that I never received a reward, I never received any money.  He was a Father.  He explained that if somebody has -- if somebody takes money out of the parish coffers -- everyone says exactly how much money they had taken out of the coffers.  And Edward explained that ************, to the effect that nobody said they had taken money out of the coffers.  I do admit that I was working under cohesion, and I don't see how I could have then claimed a salary for that work.  I don't understand the persons who have come here to claim that I received a sum of money after that work.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Still on the same page, three paragraphs further down, the sentence that begins with the le soir or evening -- everyone is ready:  So, in the evening, when everyone had been killed, the two drivers, Kayishema and Kanyarukiga; Ndungutse, Ndaimana and the soldier, Kabirisa; the communal police officer, Raingere; Nisharimbere and Bonard Ndabaisinga and Andrea, and other people, went to the presbytery, where Seromba gave them some beer.  Ndungutse gave money to the drivers.  They drunk and they went home. "My question is a follows: Witness, did you receive from Father Seromba, after the destruction of the church, and in the company of other people as told here in the document, did you receive money and beer from Ndungutse? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I would like to say the following:  I have just heard that after the destruction of the church, we allegedly went to the presbytery to drink and also to receive some money.  I would like to say, frankly, and in all truth, that I never went to the presbytery.  I did take part in these horrendous acts, but it is not because I planned it.  I was compelled to do so by the authorities, and if you were to investigate this subject closely, you would find out that I did not drink beer at that time for health reasons. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, the last excerpt from this document is on page 21 of the document, at the beginning of the page.  The sentence begins with "After the burial."  If the interpreters are ready, I shall continue.  Madam President, the interpreters tell me that they are ready.  So, we are going to use this excerpt now.  I quote:  "After the burial, Seromba gave money to the employees from the Astaldi.  The people from Kibilira, who had been a great help in the Nyange massacres, were also rewarded with money and with livestock." 
BY MR. MONTHÉ: 
Q.	You were working for the Astaldi company; did you, once again, in the light of what African Rights say, did you receive money in the same way as those people from Kibilira as a reward? 
A.	Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  I would like to stress, once gain, that before testifying before this Tribunal, I swore to tell the truth.  I know that these accusations are labeled against me in the media, but it is not true.  To say that people from Kibilira came to Kivumu, I would like to comment on that.  They say that people in Kibilira were taken to Kivumu by the communal authorities; well, I didn't go and get those people.  I didn't go and get those attackers in Kibilira.  If you check, I live in Kibilira, but I live in the southern part towards Ruhengeri.  I do not live in that location where the attackers were taken from.  If those attackers came and I was not able to identify them, well, that is not my fault.  If the authorities went to Kibilira and Karufungo in order to collect attackers with the vehicle that is not my fault.  If those people say that those people came from Kibilira, the fact that I come from Kibilira does not mean that I went to pick them up.  So, I don't know whether they were paid or not, but one thing that I do know is that I did not receive any reward. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, in the excerpt that we have just used -- read together, there is one question that troubles me, and we really need a response to this question for the benefit of the Chamber.  How can you explain that the African Rights Association brings such serious charges against you can you explain that to us, please? 
A.	I would like to respond to that question.  I am appearing before the Court, I am speaking Kinyarwanda, but during the interview, and all these documents that were published, they are either published in French or English.  So, I don't understand what is written in these documents.  But now that I can express myself in my own language before this Court, and in a language I can understand, I am giving my statement on the events to which I was an eye witness.  So, I would like to ask you to follow what I am saying before this Tribunal, I am to take into account the statement of the testimony that I am giving before this Tribunal as the truthful statement or testimony, and to not take into account what 
	African Rights have said.
Q.	Witness, are you telling the Chamber that you never made a statement in Kinyarwanda to the 
	African Rights; is that what you mean? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, as I have already explained, I met with the people from 
	African Rights, I never wrote a document for African Rights.  If somebody says that I am supposed to have drafted a letter in Kinyarwanda, then they should show it to me. 
Q.	Witness, did you ever protest against the statements that were alleged to be yours? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, there were a lot of us in the Rwandan prisons, and we have spent many years there.  I have never heard any detainees who dared to write a letter protesting against statements that were alleged to be theirs.  That would be a dream.  How on earth could I have written or drafted a document to deny the statements that were alleged to be mine against Father Seromba or on the subject of Father Seromba?  In that place where I was in detention, I did regret what had happened, but I couldn't write about it.  Now that I am before this Tribunal, I think you should take my statements as the truth. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Well, the Chamber is in search of the truth.  When you say that you were not able to write a letter of protest with regard to those statements that were supposed or alleged to be yours, why couldn't you write a letter of that nature? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I would like to underline the fact that it's very difficult to write a letter and deny what African Rights have said.  I did not receive a copy of the documents that I have discovered in this Trial Chamber.  This is the very first time that I have seen these documents.  If I had seen these documents before, I might have been able to exercise my right of denial, but I would like to remind you that we had no rights in prison.  You have no rights in prison, in fact.  I think it is a privilege for me to have this opportunity to appear before this Tribunal in order to testify on the events. 
Q.	Thank you, Witnesses.  Could you please tell the Trial Chamber, apart from today, how long you have been aware of the statements that African Rights say are your -- or their existence?   If you could give us the dates, it will be very helpful.
A.	Thank you.  I would like to reply by saying that since I was aware of the African Rights Articles, I have met with people from the Tribunal, and I was asked questions on this document, and I think that I told them that I did not recognise the contents of these African Rights documents.  And that is, in fact, a bone of contention between myself and them.  There were a number of misunderstandings between us on a number of occasions.  I remember, for example, on the 28th of August 2004, when we were being prepared, they asked me to come and state that what was written by African Rights is true.  I refused to do that and they became angry.  My co-detainees saw that I was angry when those -- I parted company with those investigators.  On the 3rd September as well, I met a lady from the Prosecution team, I can't see her here today, and I said that I could not confirm the statements made by African Rights, and God willing, I would be able to appear before the Court, in order to enlighten the Trial Chamber and bring the truth to light.  Life is short and precarious, and we can't live a precarious life and lie at the same time.  So, that is what I said and that is what I stated under coercion, because I was compelled to do so.  But I can't carry on living as a liar, and that is why I asked for pardon and I wanted to come here and be able to testify in favour of Father Seromba. 
Q.	This is the very last question on the subject of this document.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
One second, please, Counsel.  I would like the witness to tell us -- he gave us the date of the 
3rd of September, but he didn't give us the year.  Could you, please, tell us the year which he was referring to?  Furthermore, I think you asked him at what time or when he learnt that African Rights had written all of this on him.  Could you please give us more details about this?  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  I heard that African Rights had written about me after I met the team from the Office of the Prosecutor.  They are the ones who showed me the document.  When I was tried by the Kibuye specialised court, I wasn't shown those documents.  All I was shown was my own writing - my own documents, and I crave your indulgence, I cannot remember the exact date.  I, therefore, do not know on what date I obtained that information.  All I know is that it was those investigators who showed me that document and invited me to confirm their contents.  You also asked me to specify the date.  I talked of the date of the 28th August 2004, and the 3rd of September 2004.  Those were the dates I was referring to. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Thank you, Witness Anastase Nkinamumbanzi. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, following these questions, I would like to tender into evidence the document I showed you, which --that is, page 403 and 416 of the charge sheet which had been tendered by the Prosecutor before he travelled.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No objection from the Prosecutor?  
MR. TOWNSEND:
I take it it is a different to the one which has already been tendered by the Prosecution?  My friend did provide me, last week, another document, but I have no problem of it being tendered.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You didn't hear him?  The Prosecutor said that you did not disclose those documents to him, but that he has no objection to allowing them to be tendered into evidence.  You found it, Prosecutor?  Very well, he has found it.  What will be the exhibit number of this document? 
MR. MONTHÉ:
D. 76, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  This document is admitted into evidence as Defence Exhibit No. D. 76.  
(Exhibit No. D. 76 admitted)
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.
 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, after dealing with these allegations made by African Rights, I would like to draw your attention to the trials that were conducted in Kibuye.  Are you ready? 
A.	Thank you, Madam President.  Your Honours.  Regarding the Kibuye trials, I would not like us to rely on all the documents.  Let us deal only with what concerns Father Seromba.  If you would like to question me on what was said about Father Seromba during those proceedings, I will be ready to provide you with the necessary information, but I am not ready to deal with the entire trial. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  We do not intend to deal with any aspects of the proceedings that do not concern you.  And to be more specific, I will deal with this document very briefly. 
A.	Thank you. 
Q.	My first question, Witness, regarding the Kibuye trial is this:  Can you, briefly, tell the Chamber what was the outcome of that Kibuye trial, as far as you are concerned?  What was the verdict of that trial, as far as you are concerned? 
A.	Regarding the judgment that was handed down by the special court in Kibuye, we were invited to confess and to plead guilty.  We were told that this procedure would enable us to enjoy certain mitigating circumstances, and I accepted that by handing the Prosecutor a confessional statement.  But in my confessional statement, I stated that I had committed those offences under coercion.  I stated that I participated in the burial of the persons who had been killed, but my confessional statement was not received.  They said that I had omitted some information when I appeared in court and my confessional statement was read out to me.  I was told that I hadn't mentioned certain persons, including Father Seromba.  They also told me I had not tried to show the responsibility of the church.  And, consequently, the prosecutor told me, "I will sentence you to death."  I was condemned.  I was sentenced -- even before having been judged, I was persecuted.  However, on that occasion, I kept quiet.  I told myself, too bad for me, come what may.  When I appeared before the court, I asked to be allowed to speak, and I said that we should observe a minute of silence in honour of the victims and what had happened in Rwanda.  But I intended to point out -- I wanted to point out before being judged and sentenced -- I wanted the authorities who had taken me to the church to be summoned, to appear in court.  I asked them whether I went to the church on my own initiative, whereas there were members of the population and the police present.  The Rwandan authorities turned down my request and said that if I did not accept to be tried or to plead guilty, they would condemn me.  The situation prevailing in Rwanda in 1998 was not very good.  I know there was a change, but in 1998, you were not entitled to a lawyer.  It is now that "Lawyers Without Borders" assist accused persons.  When you make the request, you are given a lawyer to defend you.  Now, I have presented to you, by and large, how the proceedings were conducted, and if you want to ask any further questions, I am ready to take them. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I have asked you to tell us what the verdict of the specialised court of first instance in Kibuye was, as far as you are concerned? 
A.	I was sentenced to life imprisonment.
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 

I am sorry.  Witness, do you know a man called Rabo Kasongo?  
A.	Yes, I know that person.  He was my boss, when I was working at Nyange construction site, Kivumu commune, I explained to you that he stopped being my boss when I moved to work on the road from Vungu to Gisenyi, and his name was Mathias, that is, the second boss.  He was of Italian nationality. 
Q.	Witness, it transpired from the Kibuye trial that you accused that person; is that correct? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours; the authorities did not want to believe that it was authorities of Kivumu commune who had commandeered the bulldozer.  I wanted to mention the name of 
	André Rabaud Kasongo, because after the firm paid damages to victims for the incident that occurred in Nyange Church, he was arrested.  While we were before the specialised court, everything was explained.  I said that when the church was demolished, Kasongo was not present.  All expatriates who were in Kibuye préfecture were residing in Gitarama at the time.  I explained that he was not in Nyange.  The Judges understood, and that person was released.  So, if I state that he was not in Nyange and that he did not order me to go and bring the bulldozer, why do you want to dwell on this?  Kasongo was tried and released, and I stated that he was not present at the church.  And that is why, since I told the truth to the specialised court in Kibuye, you should be sure that even now as I appear before this Court, I am telling the truth.  The offences Father Seromba is being charged with were never committed by him. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  In Kibuye, the judges were of the opinion that you destroyed the church, not under coercion, but voluntarily.  What would you say to that? 
A.	I would like the Court to understand that orders were given for the demolition of the church.  If someone dare say that I was not coerced, I was not forced to demolish the church, that person would be lying.  If I had not been coerced, why then was my colleague Evariste killed?  I know that the authorities issued orders to members of the populations to come and demolish the church.  Ndungutse himself said that he himself controlled everything happening at the church, and he provided materials and equipment.  So, if someone says that we were not coerced to demolish that church, those persons would be lying.  They would simply be bent on making sure my sentence is not mitigated.  All I know is that whether we are talking of inmates in Kibuye prison or people who are free, everyone who attended Gacaca sessions would agree that if I had refused to demolish the church, I would have been killed myself. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.   Witness, in 1998 -- do you know what was the ethnic group of the judge who tried you -- that is, while you were a refugee in 1998? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I have clocked 11 years in jail, and at times I hear people say that in Rwanda, no reference should be made to people's ethnicity or their ethnic origins.  I do not know whether we are dealing with Hutus or Tutsis, but all I know is that there were "Banyamurenge."  Even at this point in time, I know that the majority of Rwandans are Banyamurenge. 
Q.	Witness, for the record, and in the interest of justice, can you tell the Court what "Banyamurenge" means in your language? 
A.	I would like to inform you that I was born in 1962.  I don't know whether I am in a position to answer this question.  I heard of Banyamurenge while in prison.  I heard people uttering the word Banyamurenge, but I do not know what that term means.  I am, therefore, not in a position to give you the background or the history of the Banyamurenge.  When I was born, my grandfather was already dead.  It he had been alive, he would have explained to me the history of Banyamurenge. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, before I proceed, for the record, Banyamurenge is spelt as follows: 
B-A-N-Y-A-M U-R-E-N-G-E.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, if I were to put it to you that this term is used to refer to Tutsis in general, who are in the Kivu region and the Democratic Republic of Congo, would I be correct? 
A.	Thank you for this explanation you have just given me.  I still say that Banyamurenge are Rwandans like myself, and that we are members of the same -- we are citizens of the same country. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  After talking about the Kibuye trial or the Kibuye trials, we will now go into another area.  This area deals with the various statements you gave to investigators of the OTP of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda; are you ready? 
A.	I am ready to discuss those testimonies.  I am here because I am ready to answer any questions to be put to me.  If I have any problems within your questions, I will request that we take a short break and then proceed subsequently. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness, for your willingness to answer my questions, but do not hesitate to let us know if you have any problems.  My first question relating to the area, the subject I told you of; do you know the number of statements you gave to investigators of ICTR? 
A.	I believe that before I met members of the Office of the Prosecutor, I was summoned to appear at the public prosecutor's office.  When I got to the public prosecutor's office, I met Anastase Rushema, Honesfor Regoreza, and a third person whose name I no longer remember; the Prosecutor told us that some investigators from ICTR intended to meet us the following day.  He said that those investigators wanted to question us or to interview us regarding Father Seromba.  He pointed out to us that we had to give clarifications regarding the heinous acts that Father Seromba committed in Nyange church.  He told us that we should help him obtain evidence regarding the role Father Seromba had played in the demolition of the Nyange church.  We would not engage in a discussion with the Prosecutor and tell him that we were not ready to assist him as he expected.  I would like to point out to you that it was -- it is only since 2002 that such exchanges are possible.  It was in 2002 that the senior authorities of the country told us we had to tell the truth, but during that period, we were asked to implicate Seromba.  And even the expatriates, when we go to Rwanda, they pretended that they are coming to help persons.  When someone comes to Rwanda, you think he is coming to assist Rwanda, but they ask you to tell them what Seromba did, and if you try to tell them that he did nothing, those white persons would become agitated.  And this is the case, particularly in rural areas; when a person sees that a white person is angry, that person is ready to accept everything.  So, those people came to see us.  They were looking for specific information.  They wanted to implicate us in the events, and there was nothing we could do about it.  By the way, that is what the IPJ did.  It was only subsequently that anyone dared say that in accordance with the law on genocide, you couldn't say that there was conditional release.  That is what is stated in the law.  But I told the prosecutor; "You have sentenced me to life imprisonment, and you want me to give evidence against Father Seromba?  Let me point out to you that you did not want to understand me.  I told you that I had demolished the church because I was coerced to do so, and on that day you wanted me to give evidence against Seromba.  
	Anastase Rushema, who played a role in the demolition of the church was the first to accept.  I believe Rwandans have a defect.  They have a weakness.  When they commit a crime, they do not want to plead guilty of the crime.  They would rather exterminate hundreds of people and save their lives.  So, to conclude, I would like you to understand that I made those statements because I was coerced to do so, then I am here today to tell the truth.

I thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will now take the lunch break.  However, Mr. Witness, you should, henceforth, try to answer the questions concisely.  You were asked how many statements you gave, and you gave a very lengthy answer.  Of course, the lengthier your answer, the lengthier will be the cross-examination of the Prosecutor.  Don't wear yourself out.  Listen to the questions carefully and answer them concisely. 
THE WITNESS:
	Thank you, Madam President.  Yes, I will lean on your wisdom and I intend to answer all the Prosecutor's questions, same as I am ready to answer questions put to me by the Defence counsel. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We believe you, Witness.  We know that you have appeared before this Court to answer questions put to you by the Defence and the Prosecutor, and possibly questions put to you by the Chamber.  My remarks were made in the interest of justice.  I thank you.

The proceedings are adjourned, we shall resume at 2:30 p.m. 
(Court recessed from 1235 to 1435H)
 MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is called to order.  Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good afternoon. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You will continue in your evidence-in-chief and you will be led by Counsel Monthé. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Obliged, Madam President.  Madam President, Your Honours, good afternoon.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, good afternoon.
A.	Good afternoon.
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, for the record, and before proceeding with the examination, I would like to draw the attention of the Court to a name mentioned by the witness, the name is Nzabagerageza; N-Z-A-B-A-G-E-R-A-G-E-Z-A.  He also spoke of Rushema.  I am sure that name is known to the Court, and no need to spell it out then.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:  
Q.	Witness, let us resume our discussions of this morning, and my question was to find out whether you remembered the number of occasions you met with the investigators of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, you gave a lengthy answer,  but we did not hear the number of times or occasions.  If you don't remember, you say you don't, and I may assist you then. 
A.	Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  I do not remember the number of occasions or times that I met investigators of the Tribunal.  I would be grateful if you could remind me the number of times because it was not possible to take down notes so as to remember the number of times. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness, for your honesty, because, indeed, there are lots of documents that were disclosed or made available to me by the Prosecutor, which we will peruse together, and I will give you the dates listed on those documents, and then you will explain.  So, I will know whether you can answer the questions I will put to you.  Now, let me list those statements:  We will have the statement dated 11th February 2003 -- sorry, 4th of April 2002, 11th February 2003, 20th April 2005, and various other documents which are pro justicia statements or  documents -- including a report which is dated 20th August 1996 before the IPJ, Jean-Christenson Kazimbaya, of the Gitarama préfecture.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, without further ado, I will start with the document I referred to earlier, namely:  The report on the interview of a witness, Anastase Nkinamubanzi, on the 27th of August 1996.  The K-number is 0349145.  It is Prosecutor's document, and that interview was organised in the presence of Jean-Christenson Kazimbaya, and that is pelt: K-A-Z-I-M-B-A-Y-A, the IPJ with broad jurisdiction with the Gitarama préfecture.  

To allow each and everyone to follow, I will ask the registry, with your leave, to please come and pick-up this document, first of all, for the Bench, I assume the Prosecutor does not need that document even though I have a copy for him.  I will also give a copy to the witness, if that could assist him, because he does not really read French.  I have another copy for the Prosecutor if he wants.  

MR. MOSES: 
There is a Kinyarwanda original, which I don't know if my learned friend has which would be of further assistance to the witness. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Prosecutor, unfortunately I do not have a copy in Kinyarwanda.  Based on your generosity, if you can extent your good hands, naturally, I would appreciate it.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could we have another copy for the interpreters, if possible?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
That has already been done.  For once we have preempted your appeal.

Prosecutor, thank you.  That will be reciprocated.  So, Registry, could you also make one for the witness?  Thank you. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Do you have the document before you, Witness, in Kinyarwanda language, please?  
A.	Yes, I do.  Thank you.  I have the document with me. 
Q.	Do you -- first of all, do you recognise that document, before I ask you questions?  You could look through it carefully.  
A.	Thank you.  I have just looked through the document.  I do recognise the document.  All I need to do is to make a comment on it. 
Q.	I will put questions to you, you will answer, and then subsequently you will make comments as freely as you would want to.  Is that fine with you?  Is that suitable to you?  Okay. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, if it pleases you, I am ready to start my examination.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You can proceed, Counsel Monthé 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, thank you.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, can I ask you to turn to the document that was have put before you, paragraph 2, after the word L'ecole -- if you are there, please tell me.  
A.	I am there. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I am going to read what appears there and I ask you to listen very carefully and to follow on the paper before you.  I quote:  "They ordered me to destroy this church, and let me add that the priest of this parish, by the name Seromba, was there, and he said nothing with regard to the demolition of the church.  I carried out the orders in order to save my life.  Apart from those soldiers, IPJ Kayishema, as well as the priest of the said parish, Seromba -- no one else was on the spot.  I performed that duty over a three day period and he was watching over me so as to prevent me from escaping --they were watching so as to prevent me from escaping."  Witness, my question to you is the following:  You told us right from last week when you came to testify before this Court -- you told us that you came to say the truth, nothing but the truth.  But when I see a statement which contradicts what you said before this Court what do you say to that?  
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I thank you. Let me say to you that I have not come here before this Court to tell lies.   But if you take into accounts this documents which was prepared in 1996, and if you take in consideration the place where the document was drafted; in Gitarama I was in front of the Judge.  I wasn't the only one there.  There were soldiers who led you to the person who was interrogating you.  And the soldiers sat by you so as to listen to what you were saying.  And I, therefore, want to tell you that this document is not different from the one that was prepared at the time of my arrest.  You are saying that those statements seems to be inconsistent or seem to have contradicted my testimony before this Court, but let me tell you that in 1996, we were doing everything under duress, and we could not rid ourselves of such duress.  If you doubt that, I would urge you to go and carry out your investigations in Gitarama and you will find that anyone summoned to answer questions before that person did so under duress.  So, all the statements that I made were done in order to save my skin. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, let me now ask you to go to page 3 of the same document, paragraph 2, in the middle of that paragraph, if you are there; after the name Rapo André Kasongo; are you there? 
A.	Yes, I can see that excerpt.
Q.	There is a question put to you by the IPJ, and I am quoting now:  "You also said that after that duty you were given a reward of 6,000 francs from Father Seromba, and 30,000 francs from that white man by the name Rabaud Kasongo."  Witness, my question is the following:  You say before this Court that you acted under duress, that you did not earn any salary.  So, which should be the accepted one?  The one before this Court or the one before that was before the IPJ?  
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I wish to tell you, based on the oath that I have taken before this Court, you would understand that what I am saying today is the truth, and that I was used under duress in order to destroy the  church.  I could not ask for some salary or some amount of money in the form of a salary.  Seromba never gave me 6,000 francs reward, let alone Rabaud Kasongo, who never gave me the sum of 30,000 francs.  So, if you follow common sense and the truth, me collecting any amount of money is out of the question.  It is this IPJ who wrote this in order to violet my rights. 
Q.	Witness, thank you.
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, I don't have any more questions with regard to this document, and I will seek that it be placed in exhibits. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No objections from the Prosecutor. Thank you.  Document is admitted as Prosecution Exhibit No. D. 77.  

MR. MONTHÉ:
Grateful.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
D. 77.  
(Exhibit No. D. 77 admitted)
MR. MONTHÉ:
Grateful, Madam President, and I am reminded, that, Madam President, you had said this document was of the Prosecutor, but not that of the Defence? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Correction, not that of the Prosecutor, but of the Defence.  It is, indeed, of the Defence.  
(Pages 18 to 30 by Regina Limula)



























1500H
MR. MONTHÉ:
Can I now request you, Madam President, to look at a document bearing the K number 0349836.  It is a pro justitia document.  It is a rejection of the confession and the guilty plea.  With the leave of the Court, if the registry could come and pick it up, please.  Well, I don't have the copy in Kinyarwanda, Mr. Prosecutor.  I don't know whether you do have it. 
MR. MOSES:
I'm sorry, if we can have the date of the document.  It might help me locate it here.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Prosecutor, I would first of all ask the witness to return to you what -- you know, that first document that he gave me.  That should be returned to you.  Now, Prosecutor, it is document K number 349836, dated 24 November 1997, and it is titled, "Report on the refusal of the confession and guilty plea."  There is some other number there, it is WS05-116 and a K050-8175, K050-8177. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you have the said document?
A.	I have it, Counsel.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, may we proceed?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may, Counsel.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Madam President, I would like to read out three lines of this document on the first page, and three lines on the second -- last page, and then put a question to the witness.  At the end of the first page, mention is made, and I quote:  "We have noted that the Accused, called Anastase Nkinamubanzi had expressed the will to resort to the procedure of guilty plea and confession, and that his confession was made on the 14th of October 1997 in the report of the same file by the officer of the Prosecutor's office", et cetera, et cetera.  

I should now like to go on to the second page and read out the end of that page, Madam President, if I may.  Which refers to the rejection of the guilty plea of the witness present here.  And I quote -- he does not mention all the crimes that he committed.  He does not acknowledge the fact that he was paid, whereas some witnesses have said so.  And he's not asking for pardon for he insists on the fact that he acted under duress.  So that was the third reason.  

BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Mr. Witness, if you follow me correctly, I would like to put the following question to you:  How do you explain that the Rwandan judicial authorities have rejected your confession on the basis of the abovementioned reasons?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, my confession was rejected, but I would like to ask, Madam President, whether I could provide some explanations on some of the passages in this document.  During the procedure for confession and guilty plea, I was also acting under duress.  Orders were given to me.  And if you look at this document closely, you will note that in my confession I said that authorities ordered me to destroy the church -- the Nyange church.  And Father Seromba does not appear on the list of people.  And this might have been a reason for the rejection of my confession.  If I had made mention of Father Seromba, my confession would have been accepted, but since I refused to mention the name of Father Seromba, my confession was rejected.  Gaston Nsengumuremyi was sent to me and he informed me that my confession had been rejected because I had not made mention of the part played by Father Seromba in the destruction of the church.  

CIO Nsengumuremyi told me that I had been placed in Category 1 of people who were to be sentenced to death -- to the death penalty.  Later on, it was proposed to me to add Father Seromba on the list and I was also told that I had to establish or make the statement in front of him.  

Madam President, I had had enough of being compelled to mention an individual who had not been present at the church and I refused to establish any other document until I would appear before the Court.  Madam President, Your Honours, once I appeared before the Court and before giving evidence in my defence, I asked the president the reasons why my confession was rejected when the law had been promulgated.  

The president gave me the same answer than the one given by Nsengumuremyi, Gaston.  He told me that I was to mention all the authorities as well as the priests who were present.  He told me that if I agreed the minutes would be brought back to me, and once at home, if I thought I would be in a position to add those names, we would be able to continue the trial.  In my defence, I stated that I had acted under duress, and you will be able to note that I was -- the pressure was always exerted on me because of the statements I refused to make.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Mr. Witness, for the record, I wonder whether you have been confusing two people or whether we're dealing with one or the same person.  You are talking about Gaston Nsengumuremyi and it seems we have another Gaston mentioned here, the CIO.  
A.	I thank you.  I call -- the name I give him is Nsengumuremyi, Gaston.  But the Gaston who was the official in Kibuye, the deputy Prosecutor in Kibuye, was called Gaston, but maybe inquiries can be made in order to get his last name.  Perhaps an investigation can be carried out in order to ascertain the last name of Gaston who was the first deputy in Kibuye.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I have no further questions to this witness on this document K0349836, and I move that this document be entered into evidence as Defence Exhibit D. 78.  If there are no objections from the Prosecutor?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No objections from the Prosecutor.  

This document is admitted as Defence Exhibit D. 78. 
	(Exhibit No. D. 78 admitted) 
MR. MONTHÉ:
I thank you, Madam President.  

Madam President, I would now like to turn to a document bearing the number K0266159, which is a letter written by the witness on the 30th January 2001, a copy of which I will have the registry bring to you immediately.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, the document is a letter written by the present witness in which was addressed to the ministry of internal security of Rwanda.  And this was care of the director of the Kibuye prison.  Since this letter is quite fraud, I would like, if I may, and with your leave, to read it out in its entirety to you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(French spoken) 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness Nkinamubanzi, please follow closely while this letter is read out before the Court and then a number of questions will be put to you:  "Honourable minister" -- and I quote -- "I am writing this letter to you to remind you of the letter I sent to you on the 2nd of August 2000.  In that previous letter, indeed, I was requesting that I be transferred to the Gitarama prison which is closer to my family so that my family would be able to visit me more easily and, in view of my health, to be able to take care of me.  (I have contracted a pulmonary disease).  I would also like to inform you that the specialised chamber of the court of first instance has sentenced me to life imprisonment.  Therefore, if I were to be transferred to the said prison, it would not prevent me from continuing to assist the Rwandan justice and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda as is well-known by the minister of justice and institutional relations and the Prosecutor of Kibuye in order to shed light on the events which took place.  I thank you in advance for your prompt response.  Anastase Nkinamubanzi.  Copy to the minister of justice and institutional relations as well as the public Prosecutor's office." 

My first question to you, Mr. Witness, is as follows:  Do you recognise this document?
A.	I do recognise this document, Counsel. 
Q.	I thank you.  My question is on the last part of your letter.  When you say that you will continue assisting the Rwandan justice, as well as the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, as is known by the minister of justice and institutional relations as well as the public Prosecutor in Kibuye in order to shed light on the events that occurred, are you offering your assistance to the Rwandan authorities or had you already had the opportunity to work with such authorities? 
A.	I thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  I would like to briefly respond to the question put to me.  I accepted to cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and I accepted to say the truth, which I do not believe is a fault on my part.  I wrote this letter.  I had not promised the minister of justice to cooperate with him before writing this letter.  I said I was ready to answer the questions that would be asked or put to me by the investigators of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda on the events that occurred in Nyange.  So, Counsel, if I am here today describing the events at the time, I believe I am being useful to the Tribunal.  
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I have no further questions for this witness on the document we have just used.  I would like this document to be admitted as a Defence exhibit bearing the number D. 79.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No objection, from the Prosecutor. 
MR. MOSES:
No objections, Your Honour.  But I do note that there is an English and French version of the letter and I'd simply ask that both be tendered.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
And if I am not mistaken, Madam President, it seems that there are even three versions because I can see some Kinyarwanda at the back of one of the letters, but since I do not understand the Kinyarwanda language, perhaps the three versions could be subject to your approval, of course, Mr. Prosecutor.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  May this document dated 30th January 2001 be admitted as Defence Exhibit D.79A, B and C, for the three versions, French, English and Kinyarwanda.  
(Exhibit No. D. 79A, D. 79B and D. 79C admitted)
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  

Madam President, I would like, if I may, now, to deal with the statements made by the witness to the ICTR investigators and, more specifically, the first statement, which is in my possession, dated 4th April 2002.  It is a Prosecution exhibit bearing the number K023-3769, K0233771, 3774.  Madam President, I would like to indicate to the Chamber, with my apologies, that I worked on a redacted version because I was not able to obtain the unredacted version.  I do not wish to enter into any polemics here, but I would simply like the Chamber to know that if this document was to be tendered into evidence, it would be the redacted version.  That being said, Madam President, subject to my previous comment, I would kindly request, with your leave, that registry come to me to get these documents that are in my possession.  
MR. MOSES:
Your Honours, if it's going to assist, I've got some unredacted copies, if that -- I don't know if my friend would prefer to deal with the redacted copies or the unredacted, but I have copies of the unredacted ones which I can provide to him, the witness and the Court.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
I am extremely grateful to you, Mr. Prosecutor.  We are all acting like gentlemen today.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are quite happy to note that such is the case.  
MR. MOSES:
Five copies of the French original, if -- and an English copy.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Mr. Prosecutor, perhaps a copy could be sent to me so that I could be able to make photocopies.  We also need copies for the interpreters.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, could you be so kind as to provide a copy to counsel.  

Have the interpreters also received copies?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Counsel Monthé, you have the floor.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I would like to look at one of those statements you made to the investigators of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.  You admitted, throughout your testimony, having met with the investigators of the Prosecutor's office of this Tribunal; is that correct?
A.	I did meet with the investigators.  
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  This document is dated 4th April 2002.  And it has been provided by the investigators of the Prosecutor's office.  It contains your statements.  Do you recognise this document? 
A.	Yes, I do.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, at the beginning of this statement, which was provided to me by the Prosecutor, we read the following statement.  And I shall read it out and ask you to listen closely.  This excerpt is on page 3 of the document, at the very beginning, after the word "confidential".  And I would be ready to read out the excerpt if all the parties are ready.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please proceed, Counsel. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, here is what the document says, and I quote:  "I am before the interviewers from the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, willingly.  If I were requested to do so, I would testify before the Tribunal in Arusha.  If the competent authorities of my country authorise my travel to the Tribunal."  Mr. Witness, here is the question I would like to put to you:  Did you willingly meet with the interviewers of the Tribunal in order to give the statement of the 4th of April 2002?  And do you recognise the statements contained therein?
A.	Thank you.  As regards the statements I made, and the people I met with, I did not take the initiative to meet with strangers.  We are usually summoned to the public Prosecutor's office and, once we're there, we are told what to do.  

As regards the excerpt which was just read out by counsel for the Defence, I would like to say that I did not request to meet with the investigators, but it is CIO Rushema and Murabayeba (phonetic) who informed us that we were to meet investigators who were involved in the Seromba case.  Since I was arrested on the 13th, this copy had been circulating and I was asked several times why I had made specific statements on specific dates, and this is the reason why I do not give any credence to the documents that were produced before that date.  I would like you to, rather, assess the truth I am saying before this Court right now.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, let me be more specific for our debates to be clear.  When the investigators came to you, were you in a position to express yourself freely, yes or no?
A.	As regards the investigators from the Prosecutor's office, when they meet with you, they tell you that they would like you to cooperate in a given case, and when you talk to them, they tell you that if you refuse to give testimony the Rwandan authorities will harm you.  And in order to incite you to cooperate, they tell you that they will talk to the Prosecutor for him to serve a lesser sentence -- or, a lighter sentence to you.  And if you make confessions, they also tell you that they will negotiate the admission of your confession.  Since I met with the investigators, I expressed the will not to be involved in the Seromba case.  If they wanted me to express myself freely, but they insisted and told me that I should state that Father Seromba ordered me to destroy the church, and they told me that this could be helpful to me in my own case.  Madam President, I would like to inform you that the investigators are free to meet with any authority.  They put proposals to us, they urge us to tell lies, and I wish to inform you that there are documents that prove such facts.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I would like to put a number of questions to the witness on page 7 of the document we are dealing with.  And, more specifically, on the first paragraph of page 7, which starts after the word "Astaldi".  And, if I may, I would like to quote this excerpt and then put a question to the witness.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Mr. Witness, please follow closely while I read out this excerpt.  

"After having finished washing the bodies, the deputy bourgmestre, Védaste, called me by my name.  I went to him and I heard him say, "Now that you have finished cleaning up, continue your work by destroying this church."  And I answered him by repeating aloud three times, "It is not possible that I destroy the house of God.  I cannot do that."  With my refusal, Mupende, Kayishema, Ndahimana and the gendarmes went to the presbytery.  They came back accompanied by Abbé Seromba, who was in front of the group.  Seromba came directly to me saying -- and the sentence is in Kinyarwanda.  I shall only read the translation of this sentence, which is an unofficial translation.  "He has decided it should be destroyed.  We will build another.  In front of these authorities, with the authorisation of what I considered an order from the words of the father of the parish, coupled with the crowd around us shouting that I must do it immediately, if not, I will be killed.  I started the Caterpillar and began by tearing down the third door on the right side of the church on the side of the road."   

Witness, do you recognise that statement, the events so alleged?  Did they proceed in that manner. 
A.	I wish to take you back slightly to the first statement that I made.  Occasionally, the investigators would come and meet you with people who are seeking their own interests.  I never made mention of Mupende.  I said Mupende was the one who asked me to come back to the church after the burial of the corpses.  Mupende, Murangabugabo, Védaste, told me that they didn't have to demolish the church.  I said that Védaste was on the right-hand side, Rushema was on the left.  So I would urge you to understand what appears in this statement.  I would like you to compare this statement to the other documents which were drawn up on the 13th, when I was arrested.  And the IPJ, or the public prosecutor's office in Kigali, sent those documents to the investigators.  And he does underline the passages that have to be included in the statement.  And the interpreters can say anything they want to say because I don't understand French.  So, please, do not consider -- or -- that statement but, rather, my testimony today before the Court.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I have one last question to put to you on this document, Witness:  It is at the end of the paragraph that I referred to earlier, and it is the sentence that comes after the word "church".  And I quote:  "Father Seromba moved towards me, and then he said" -- "came directly to me saying" -- and the translation of what he says in Kinyarwanda is "destroy all these walls".  Do you recognise that, Witness?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I wish to say that this statement -- well, thank you for putting questions to me in connection with this statement.  And I also thank you for giving me the opportunity to explain.  I'm going to tell you why this statement was added on to the testimony.  Please, do not attach any importance to this document.  I told you that Father Seromba came when the first wall collapsed, but if I were to put a question to you, was the church demolished on two occasions?  The demolition started on the 16th and ended on the 16th, unless they are going to tell me that the church was destroyed, and they built another wall, and then reconstructed the next day.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Before we finish with this document, can I ask you to turn to page 8 of the document, at the end of the first part of the paragraph.  You have, after the word "day", let me quote, and then I'm going to put questions to you.  

"Those who came to supervise our work were Ndungutse, Kayishema, Habiyambere, Ndahimana, Mupende, Seromba, Mbakirirehe and Bamenya.  Is that what you told the investigators of this Tribunal, yes or no?
A.	That despicable act perpetrated in Nyange was led by the authorities, the officials.  Of course, the investigators do everything in order to direct the offence in a manner that they wish, that's why I said that those who went on the spot should not be bound.  Let me remind you, for instance, that I didn't say and did not see bourgmestre Ndahimana on the spot.  I was expecting that kind of question, for instance.  And if someone were to put that question to me, I would have answered that bourgmestre Ndahimana had gone to attend to a burial.  All the same, I would say that there were a lot of people, there was a huge crowd, people who had come from all three communes, there was Kivumu, Mabanza and Kibirira.  People who had come from those communes.  If such a question were put to me, I would have answered that Ndahimana was bourgmestre, and that he was with -- I would answer that Ndahimana was, rather, not on the spot, that he had -- his assistants and other officials of the commune were there when the events occurred.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, at this juncture, these documents referenced above will not be a matter requiring that this witness be interviewed thereon.  I'm asking, therefore, that it be admitted as a Defence exhibit D. 80.  Madam President, I have had the document given to me by the Prosecutor.  I've had it photocopied.  Well, it is in English, and we'll need to produce a copy in French, so with your permission, I give you a copy in English.  And what we have, of course, it is -- it is redacted and so -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But we do have the French version which is redacted.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
So that will be D. 80 of the Defence, A for French, B for English, or as you see fit, if there's no objection on the other side of the Court.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No objection, Prosecutor. 
MR. MOSES:
No objection, Your Honour.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Document dated 4 April 2002 is admitted as Defence Exhibit -- under the number D. 80A and B, for French and English versions. 
(Exhibit No. D. 80 admitted)
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  

I would now wish to continue with a document from the Prosecutor dated 20 April 2005, number K033-9710-9723, French version, which I will promptly make available to you, Madam President, Your Honours.  The booths having already had copies beforehand.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You can proceed, Mr. Monthé.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Now, this is a document comprising several pages, specifically nine pages.  One is a statement; two -- page 2 is a pro justitia.  It is the Accused statement, that is, from page 3 to page 9 for purposes of clarity.  

Madam President, I will, if you allow me, start with page 1 of the document.  The date is 4th of March 1995.  It is, in fact, a statement.  I'm going to read the first passage, then I'm going to ask questions.  

Here is what appears in the document:  "I the undersigned Anastase Nkinamubanzi, do recognise having killed 2,000 people in April 1994 using a bulldozer belonging to Astaldi in collaboration with the bourgmestre of Kivumu, Kayishema, the IPJ of the Kivumu commune, the presiding judge of the tribunal de canton, and a priest of the Nyange church by the name Seromba."   
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, my question is the following:  Do you recall or recognise having made that statement?  That's my first question.
A.	As I already explained, Madam President, Your Honours, this document is dated 1995.  I had told you the circumstances under which we were interviewed, and the events that had occurred in Rwanda.  And I had explained to you or told you who had arrested me and who had questioned me on the events that occurred at the church.  You can imagine the kind of questions put to me and the answers that I provided.  You have to consider that context before I continue to answer the questions put to me.  
Q.	Thank you for that answer.  And let me say to you that it is, in fact, the Bench listening to you.  They are the ones who have jurisdiction over us here.  My next question is the following:  Why the figure 2,000 and not some other figure, not 1,000, not 300, not 1,500?  Why 2000? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I wish to tell you where I was, right from the trench to the prison yard.  And when I was picked up from the prison, and put somewhere in some secret place in Sonarwa, I was compelled to say that it was 2,000 people who were killed.  For instance, some soldier would come and propose a figure, say 100,000, that I should accept that.  Another one would say 1,000 people, and some others would say 500 or 2,000.  I was bound to accept those figures.  And so the last person to deal with my case, with my file, which was prepared in Mabanza, that person was surprised, and he wondered how I could have killed 2,000 people.  There is another detainee who was accused of having killed 5,000 people, some other blamed for having killed 10,000 people, and that's why I am pleased that now the Gacaca courts have started and for them to understand that a single person could not kill 2,000 people.  If we look at the space in the church.  And I am pleased that they are going to find out that, give the space in the Nyange church, 2,000 people could not go in there.  So I do not agree with that figure.  I know that there were a lot of people within the church, but that figure does not come up to 2,000.  I know that a lot of people were killed in Nyange, but there were people who were killed outside the church.  And within that church there were both Hutus and Tutsis.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  For further clarity, to enlighten us further, you say that there weren't 2,000, or you say there were a lot of people.  In your view, as an approximation, maybe I'm annoying you, but I'm going to ask you how many people were in that church, if you know?  
A.	Let me tell you here, as I already said this morning, if all the witnesses coming from Rwanda, to testify before the Court -- now, if all those people told the truth, you would already have known the truth.  The first person to suggest these figures was not even on the spot.  There are witnesses who come here and suggest figures with no evidence, who come up before this microphone to propose figures, who complete their testimony and move away.  I would, therefore, like to say that Rushema and Rugwizangoga did count the number of people who were within that church because they were seeking assistance.  I know that some of these people appeared before this Court.  That question should have been put to them.  But, as far as I'm concerned, I'm not in a position to suggest a figure.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, Witness, I want to go on to the next document, which was made available to us.  It is -- it based the number K0339712.  It is produced here as dated 22 July 1997.  It is prepared before Gaston Nsengumuremyi, who is attached to the specialised chamber of the court of first instance of Kibuye.  

MR. MONTHÉ:
And for the record, Madam President, maybe I should spell the name Nsengumuremyi, N-S-E-N-G-U-M-U-R-E-M-Y-I.

Now, after laying that foundation, I would like you to refer to page 4 of the document, please.  

Madam, I shall comply with the schedule of the Trial Chamber.  If you allow me to ask those questions after the break.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Monthé.  

We will take a break -- a couple of minutes' break, then we'll resume later.  We adjourn.  Thank you. 
(Court recessed from 1600H to 1620H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is called to order.  

Counsel Monthé, you may continue with your examination-in-chief of the witness.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  

Madam President, before the break it was my intention to use document K0339713, which is the transcript of the -- the (unintelligible) of the witness and, more specifically, page 4 of the said document.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you follow me?
A.	Yes, I did.  I do have page 4 in front of me.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Mr. Witness, if you have followed me, I would like you to go to section four of the said document.  Are you there?
A.	Yes, I can see question No. 4. 
Q.	Question No. 4 reads as follows:  

"How many priests were in Nyange at the time?" 

"A.  I only saw one priest called Seromba and I didn't know of any other."   

Do you acknowledge having made such a statement?
A.	Yes, I do.  
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  Mr. Witness, I would like you to refer to page 5 of the same document.  At the end of the paragraph, which reads as follows, if you are ready, from the word -- or, rather, after the excerpt -- the excerpt starting after "body".  Very well.  I quote:  

"When I asked, he went to the courtyard of the presbytery and he came back with Father Seromba.  Father Seromba asked me to destroy the church and added that he would build another one.  I asked him, 'Are we going to destroy God's church?'  And he answered, 'Yes, you can destroy it.  We shall build another one.'  I destroyed it starting by the other side of the door."   

Mr. Witness, do you recognise this statement? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, as I stated previously, I would like to make a comment on these statements based on the time when the statements were given.  One should not overlook the conditions under which we were arrested in very difficult circumstances.  You should not forget either that I was the one who had played a part in the destruction of the church and that when I was in front of the people interviewing me I had no right whatsoever.  I asked you to take due account of the events at the time.  The country had just come out of a war.  What answer do you wish me to provide?  If I was the one who had destroyed the church and I was in front of somebody who was questioning me and it was immediately after the war, what answer would you have expected me to give to that person?  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Mr. Witness, on page 6 of the same document at the very beginning of the page, you state, and I quote, at the end of the first sentence, after the word "bury", you say, and I quote:  "I worked for three days."   At the beginning of your testimony, before the Chamber, you did say that you had started destroying the church around 11:30 and that you had finished between 3:30 and 4 p.m.  So how do you explain the inconsistency in the duration of this act? 
A.	I wish to say that before I started destroying the church, I was not wearing a watch, so I did not look at the time.  I know that the destruction started at around 10:30 and that it ended around 3:30 p.m. unless someone says otherwise; for example, Gaston, who stated that I had gone to the church once and then I had gone there again, as if the church had been destroyed the first time around, built all over again, and then destroyed all over again.  I do know that the church was destroyed between 10:30 in the morning and 3:30 in the afternoon.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I would kindly request that you refer to page 7 of this document, please.  At the beginning of this page we have question No. 12, which reads as follows, and I quote:  

"How many people were at the scene while you were destroying the church?"  

And the answer to this question is:  "There was just me, CIO Kayishema, Father Seromba and some soldiers.  No other member of the population was present."  

How can you explain this answer, Mr. Witness?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, you will note the inconsistency between the statements.  Why is that so?  Well, the inconsistencies are due to the fact that several people came to see me.  But I told all those people that there were many people and that on the Friday a grenade was launched on the church, but the person who interviewed me, at the time, wanted me to say exactly what he or she wanted.  Before the court of first instance in Kibuye, I did make such statements.  I recall that when I was asked to make specific statements, I would answer that it was well known that dynamite was used, that the bulldozer was also used, and that I could in no way deny such facts, but the soldiers would come to me and tell me that I had to state that Ndungutse, Kayishema and Father Seromba were those who were responsible for these acts.  And since I wish to save my skin, I was ready to accept saying such things.  This is why I persist in saying that one has to take into account what conditions I was under at the time I was interviewed.  I thank you. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  So as not to belabour the point, I'm not going to put a question to you on question No. 14 if your answer is to be the same.
A.	I thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  If the question which was just raised by counsel is similar to question No. 14, my answer, indeed, will be the same, and I would urge him to put another question to me.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
I thank you, Madam President.  At this stage of my examination-in-chief of this witness, I have no further questions for this witness on the said document, and I wish to tender into evidence this document as Defence exhibit D. 81, if there are no objections from the Prosecutor.  
MR. MOSES:
Your Honours, there's no objection to the documents being admitted.  Can I suggest, however, there are, in fact, two separate documents I think that are contained in that package of disclosure.  And, subject to my learned friend, can I suggest that the letter of -- dated 4th March, which has been referred to the witness, be D. 81.  I have copies of that in English, French and Kinyarwanda.  And I'm happy for those to be produced as a Defence Exhibit.  

And similarly, if the 22nd July statement can be entered as a separate Defence Exhibit.  The reason I suggest this is because I may have questions to the witness on these documents, and I think it would be easier for everyone to follow if they are given separate numbers, but subject to any comments that my friend has.  That would be my suggestion.  I have the 22nd of July also in all three languages.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, what the Prosecutor says is relevant.  It does happen that the document that I have was just in French, only in French, and obviously I've drawn the attention of the Trial Chamber when I started using it that there were two types of documents.  And for there not to be any ambiguity or any confusion between the Prosecutor and myself, I have no objection that that number remain maintained.  I would prefer to keep copies in Kinyarwanda so as to be sure that we're talking about the same thing.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Monthé.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Excellent, Madam President.  With my gratitude to the Prosecutor.  And they are fully consistent with each other.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank Counsel Monthé, Prosecutor.  So we admit the document dated 4th March 1995 as Defence exhibit No. D. 81A, B, C, to cover all three languages. 
(Exhibit No. D. 81A, D. 81B and D. 81C admitted)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now, the second document dated 22nd July is admitted as Defence Exhibit No. D.82A, B, C, for all three languages, French, English and Kinyarwanda.  
(Exhibit No. D. 82A, D. 82B and D. 82C admitted)
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  

Madam President, I would like to continue examining this witness with the following question.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Are you still detained at the Gitarama prison?
A.	I am in the Gitarama prison since the 22nd February 2002.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you meet a Félécien Ntibanoja -- that is N-T-I-B-A-N-O-J-A -- at the Gitarama prison?  Did you meet him at the Gitarama prison?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I did meet that individual by the name of Félécien Ntibanoja.  I got to know him at the Gitarama prison not that long ago.  
Q.	Could you tell the Court what your relation with that individual is?
A.	As I stated earlier -- or, previously, occasionally one is a victim of injustice, Madam President, Your Honours.  That individual by the name of Félécien Ntibanoja was in Gitarama prison.  He had a problem.  When I came here, I left Gitarama and I came here and, I think, it was on the 17th of September 2004.  I came here to Arusha to testify and I was kept at the prison yard.  And then I went back to Rwanda without giving evidence.  So when I got back to the Gitarama prison yard, the individual by the name of Félécien Ntibanoja was quickly transferred to Mpanga.  He was accused of having advised me to testify on behalf of Father Seromba.  And since then I have heard that Félécien Ntibanoja is at Mpanga.  And I don't have any news about him.  And that is an example of an act of injustice.  And I know that, until today, no one can impose his or her position on someone else.  Now, to answer your question, Counsel, those are the circumstances under which I got to know Félécien Ntibanoja not so long ago.  So he was transferred or moved out, so we're no longer together.  
Q.	Witness, could you tell the Court whether that gentleman, Félécien Ntibanoja, has any link whatsoever with Father Seromba, who is here?
A.	To tell you the truth, let me answer the question raised by Defence counsel.  And to answer, based on the information I have, it would appear that he's the brother of Father Seromba.  I don't know whether he's the elder or younger brother.  I didn't try to find out because I had no close links with that individual by the name Ntibanoja.  So it's not too long ago since his transfer from Kibuye to Gitarama prison yard.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Are you trying -- or, do you want to tell the Court that Ntibanoja never approached you to come and testify on behalf of his brother, Father Seromba?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, that is what I actually wanted to say.  I wanted to say that Félécien Ntibanoja didn't need to come and compel me to testify on behalf of Father Seromba.  I have always wanted to tell the truth.  When I decided to testify on behalf of the Defence.  There are officials from the Gacaca courts who come, whenever they find us in prison, they say we should always tell the truth.  And they said if amongst us if there is anybody who has borne false testimony against anyone, that he or she should change such a testimony in the course of the Gacaca court sessions.  So, to sum up, he couldn't come and oblige me to follow his decision, for instance, to testify on behalf of someone.  I took that initiative.  Life is short on earth.  And I didn't want to be on bad terms with my God.  And that's why I testified that Father Seromba had no role at all -- played no role.  You can carry out your investigations, but I personally will say that Father Seromba played no role at all in what happened.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I also want to find out from you whether, at the Gitarama prison, you met a certain Mark Hakizimana.
A.	Madam President, Your Honours.  Now, regarding Mark Hakizimana, I would say that, indeed, he was at that prison yard.  He came when the detainees from the Kibuye prison yard were moved to the Gitarama prison yard.  He also had problems.  He had a problem -- there was a problem with the witnesses who had to come and testify here.  Most of the other detainees feel that when we come to testify here, we come to fell lies.  Killings took place in broad daylight and people are no longer afraid.  And I would say to you that lie telling does not exist.  So he came and the witnesses who came to testify here did so and started accusing Félécien Ntibanoja and Mark Hakizimana and Joseph Ndagijimana, and those people had to be moved to the Mpanga prison because they prevented Anastase Nkinamubanzi from testifying on behalf of Father Seromba.  I faced a lot of problems when I left Arusha.  I had to appear before the police station for two weeks.  And the police told me that "No one could influence you to make you change your opinion" -- or, make me change my opinion.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I don't know whether there was some mistake on my part.  I heard the -- that is testify "for the Defence."  I believe the witness was talking about testifying for the Prosecution.  Madam President, could you please ask the witness to repeat his answer.  It is possible that the interpreter in the Kinyarwanda booth was mistaken.  Could he please repeat his answer. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, did you follow what was said?  Could you please repeat your answer.  You talked about Defence or Prosecution witness.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, maybe I should ask the question.  I don't know whether the witness is still aware of what is being asked of him.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You can repeat your question, Counsel, if witness is not in a position to provide an answer.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Obliged, Madam President.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, you did tell the Court that you came here and you did not testify for the Prosecution against Father Seromba and, upon your return home, you had to report at the police station over a two-week period.  So, for the record, did you testify for the Prosecution or for the Defence?
A.	Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  We shall answer that question that led to the comment I made.  Defence counsel asked me when I knew Félécien Ntibanoja, and I so stated.  Then he asked me when I got to know Mark, I also said -- did say so, and I said these people face problems.  And when I left Arusha the last time, namely, on the 17th of September 2004, I came here, but I wasn't able to testify.  I went back to Rwanda and, upon my arrival there, those people started having problems.  There were other witnesses who came from Arusha who accused them of having advised me to testify for Father Seromba.  They were transferred.  And after they were transferred, I was summoned to the police station, and there I was asked to mention the names of those who prevented some others from giving a guilty plea -- entering a guilty plea.  So I face this problem.  And I said no one can influence anyone else or prevent them from making his or her confession or entering a plea guilty.  According to the law, promulgated by the officials or authorities -- I told the policeman that that was not the case.  And those are the circumstances under which I got to know those people, those who were deprived of their rights.  But when Mark had to be transferred he was in hospital, I believe he was released for health reasons.  As for Félécien Ntibanoja, he's still in the prison yard to which he had been transferred.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
For the record, let me spell the name Ntibanoba.  It is N-T-I-B-A-N-O-B-A, Félécien Ntibanoba.  The witness referred to Hakizimana, Mark.  H-A-K-I-Z-I-M-A-N-A.  And, finally, he talked about Ndagijimana, Joseph, and that's spelt N-D-A-G-I-J-I-M-A-N-A.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, at the Gitarama prison yard, did you hear from the other detainees that they collected money to come and testify for and on behalf of Father Seromba?  Did you hear any such thing, without mentioning any names?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, in the Gitarama prison yard, the -- or, those -- the other detainees accused us of that fact.  They told lies so that we can testify along those lines.  They made mention of that, but never mentioned the name of the person who collected any such money or the person who gave such monies.  They made such allegations so as to create problems between the other detainees and the other authorities.

BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Now, I want to ask you, Witness, in Gitarama, were there some detainees who enjoyed certain benefits, like, for instance, the reduction of their sentences and other benefits so as to come here and accuse Father Seromba? 
A.	In any case, if such a question were put to me by Defence Counsel, I would say that in the prison yard it would appear people are telling the truth.  No one enjoyed any reduction of sentence or term of imprisonment in return for a testimony against Father Seromba.  When people testified against 
	Father Seromba, they were released and taken into the solidarity camps.  There was a decree that allowed for the release of those who had confessed and released while we were here in the month of September.  The detainees, who I had come with here, were hopeful of the fact that they were going to be released.  The question was even asked of someone of the public prosecutor's office and the officer was asked to phone Kigali, to inform Kigali that we were here and to inform them further that we should be placed on the list a amongst those who were going to be released.  That officer of the public prosecutor's office said he never heard any such communique.  He had promised that he was going to follow the matter and he was going to inform the authorities that we were here.  

Madam President, Your Honours, you asked me to be brief, but let me add that on the day of the release there was ***************************************************************************************************************. 
Q.	Witness, please, Witness, please, I asked you not to mention names so that we don't engage in any polemics here 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, did you want to come in with respect to certain matters. 
MR. TOWNSEND: 
I ask Your Honours that the names mention be placed in closed session or under seal.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objection, Defence?  You have understood the Prosecutor.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Absolutely not.  It is in the interest of justice. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Therefore, the names mentioned by the witness should be put under seal. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Obliged, Madam President.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness Nkinamubanzi, as someone in the prison yard, could you tell the Court whether each week there are deaths of detainees in that prison? 
A.	I would like to seek clarification from Defence Counsel.  There are several people who have died of natural causes.  Somebody is sick, somebody could be killed.  In short, I can tell you that people have died.  And I wish to say further, nobody has really been killed, people have died of natural causes. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, I would like to ask you, on two or three occasions you have told the Court that you have come to Arusha, if my recollection doesn't fail me. -- that you came to Arusha at the request of the Prosecutor and you refused to testify against Father Seromba.  Now if that is the case, why did you refuse to testify against Father Seromba?  That's my question? 
A.	Let me talk about my coming here to Arusha.  On 28th of August 2004, the lady prosecutor who is sitting there in the middle, came and met me in Gitarama.  She told me that she was to prepare me because I would be required to come to Arusha to testify.  She showed me some excerpt in a statement, in Kinyarwanda.  I am not too sure any more whether it is in English or in French.  It was stated therein that Father Seromba had ordered the church to be destroyed, that the church would be rebuilt and that the Hutus were larger in number.  So I discussed with the lady that I wasn't going to come here to make such allegation against Father Seromba.  So we separated in disagreement.  On the 3rd of September in the office of the deputy superintendent of the prison, I was called again by the lady Prosecutor and she showed me that excerpt and she said she was coming to prepare me as part of my testimony.  And she asked me to state that it was Father Seromba who had ordered that the church be demolished.  That it should be demolished, that some other church would be rebuilt.  I refused to testify against someone on the basis of lies.  And I said that all I wanted was to appear and to tell the truth about what happened, and that the Judges were going to determine -- that they were going to weight my testimony.  And that lady from the office of the Prosecutor told me that she was going to leave and she told me that we were going to meet here in Arusha.  And that was not all.  I am going to tell you everything.  The Prosecutor Gregory met me in Gitarama.  He showed me documents, I read the passage and I was concerned.  I was worried, Madam President, Your Honours.  I want to tell you that if you believe in God, you know fully well that God wants is to tell the truth and that we seek forgiveness for the sins we have committed.  And so I refused.  Mr. Gregory took the pictures or a photograph.  I promised him that I will come to Arusha but to tell the truth.  On the 17th, I came here on the 17th of September 2004.  I came here.  We were at the prison yard in the rooms assigned to us.  I met Mr. Gregory, the gentleman sitting here.  He came to see me in order to prepare my testimony before the Court.  In the room where we were he asked me to state that Father Seromba had ordered me to destroy the church.  Madam President, Your Honours, at times under duress, one might accept anything to save one's skin.  I had left Rwanda to come here and I thought I was coming freely.  I thought I was to make my testimony freely and willingly.  I can give my consent but once before the Chamber I can say that this -- whatever I said was taken under duress.  And when I arrived here, I was free to testify.  And on the 25th of September I met with Prosecutor Gregory.  I was ill at the time and I told you that I am disabled.  He asked me whether I would prove the role played by 
	Father Seromba during the acts that were perpetrated at the church and I told him that I would state that Father Seromba was attacked by the authorities of the Kivumu commune, including those who were in charge of security.  That is the reserve officers.  And I told him that I knew for a fact, Seromba had played no part whatsoever in the events of the church.  He came back on the 30th and he asked me whether I was certain that Father Seromba had played no part whatsoever in the destruction of Nyange.  My answer to that was that as far as, I was concerned, I believed Seromba had been attacked by men who were stronger than he was.  And I also told him that I could not attribute any role to 
	Father Seromba in the events of the Nyange church.  He left.  And on October the 1st, the officer of the Victims and Witness Section, who is not present here, a white lady, when I was brought here, before the Courts, I stated that I would give testimony in public.  She made me sign a document and told me that if I was to give testimony in open session, I was to ensure my own security.  My answer was that, "If we were not under the protection of God, whatever we would do, would be worthless".  

Gregory came back later on and I repeated once again that I could not state that Seromba had played a part in the destruction of the church.  And he told me that I would not testify and that I would go back to Rwanda.  And since he was going on mission somewhere in Yugoslavia, for another case, he asked me to go back to Rwanda and promised me that he would call me again for me to testify before this Court.  The people who had came with me stayed and it was decided that I would testify in open Court in order to talk about the links between myself and Father Seromba and the circumstances under which the crimes were perpetrated.  I was unlucky or the promise Gregory made, whereby I would come before this Court again to testify led to a number of problems for me.  When I went back to Rwanda, I was imprisoned and I was told that I had lost my head in Arusha and - lost my mind, rather, in Arusha.  Madam President, you are presiding this Chamber, and I would like you to blame him because he did not keep to his promise. 

	Once I reached Rwanda, I was imprisoned and I was sent back to the Gitarama prison.  So, I did not testify on that day.  I waited for Gregory to bring me back before this Court. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
And the witness says he had said here -- he says that I had come to testify on behalf of 
	Father Seromba.  And according to that promise I was to come and tell the truth on the events that occurred in the Nyange church.  I am no longer afraid to tell the truth about the events that took place in Nyange.  

Madam President, Your Honours, it is under such circumstances that I came here to testify before this Chamber and I was not able to do so at that time. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness, for this very long explanation.  Mr. Witness, I would like you to look me in the eye and tell me quite sincerely whether you have told us the truth this afternoon. 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, ever since the day I started testifying before this Court and ever since I made my solemn declaration, I would like to state that whatever I said on Father Seromba is the truth.  And I have testified before this Court willingly, and without expecting any reward.  Father Seromba never ordered me to destroy the church.  I have just explained to you the misunderstanding between myself and the Prosecutor, for I had asked him to let me say the truth and nothing but the truth.  I also told the Prosecutor that even before the Gacaca Courts of Kivumu all the members of the public said that Seromba had never played a part in the destruction of the church and I asked him why he persisted in coercing me into saying that Seromba had played a part in the destruction of the church.  I believe I told him rather that he should rather try to help in arresting those who were responsible for the destruction of the church rather -- before I made my statement.  As for my testimony before this Court, it is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, Your Honours, this marks the end of my examination-in-chief of witness, 
Nkinamubanzi, Anasthase.  I wish to thank you, the Chamber for it's patience and I wish to express to this very courageous witness, our best wishes and we wish him a safe journey back to his country and hope to see him soon.  In any case we grant him God (inaudible).  Thank you and I would now like to leave the floor to my learned friend on the other side of the Court. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel. Monthé.  Mr. Prosecutor, you may start your cross-examination of this witness.
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, I want to be brief and I will try and frame my questions for precise answers and if you can assist us all by answering only the questions that I ask.  Do you understand? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I wish to answer the - or, rather, react to the comment made by the Prosecutor.  The fact about not asking many questions does not mean that he pities me.  I would like to invite him to make his submissions before this Chamber.  As for giving me guidelines on the way in which I am to respond to his questions, I believe he should let me answer his questions freely.  And I also believe that he can make his submissions before the Chamber for the Judges to be able to assess. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I believe you have not understood the Prosecutor, who said that he would word his questions in such a way that you would be able to provide specific answers, but he did not give any indications as to the answer -- the answers you were to give to the questions. 
THE WITNESS:
Very well, I agree.  The Prosecutor may proceed with his questions. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, you have the floor. 

BY MR. MOSES: 
Q.	Can I summarise your evidence so far as it relates to Father Seromba on the day that the church was bulldozed?  You are saying now that the only contact you had with Father Seromba was after you had commenced destroying the church.  Am I correct in saying that to you, Witness?  
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, during the course of my testimony I stated having seen 
	Father Seromba after the (inaudible) of the church had been destroyed.  When he was berating Rushema because he was telling him that he had forbidden them to kill anyone inside the church.  As for the other proposition you are putting it is not true. 
Q.	Where exactly was Father Seromba when you saw him and heard him berating Rushema, where was he? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, the Prosecutor seems to have misunderstood.  When 
	Father Seromba suddenly arrived on the site he was berating one, Rushema for having killed people at the church whereas he had told them not to do so.  I believe, I answered this question before today.  I don't know whether the answer I provided was not satisfactory to you. 
Q.	When you say on the site, where exactly do you mean? 
A.	He was next to the church when the wall of the church collapsed.  He came and he was walking hurriedly.  I told you that Rushema was on the left hand-side whereas Muragamugabo was on the 
	right-hand side.  He was close to the bulldozer and this is why I was able to hear what he was telling these two gentlemen. 
Q.	Which side of the church was this, where you saw him by the bulldozer?  Was it on the side of the Presbytery or on the side of the road leading to Kibuye? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I believe Prosecutor usually mixes up things in order to confound witnesses.  But during my testimony I did say that the side leading to the faculty was the first one to collapse.  I believe, I said so lengthily.  And I explained several times on what side the destruction was started with the bulldozer. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, if you want to us make progress and if you want everything to go smoothly you would be so kind as to answer the Prosecutor's questions in specific terms.  It is -- the Prosecutor is entitled to ask or to put to you a question that was already put to you in examination-in-chief because he is seeking some clarification or confirmation.  So, please, listen to the question and answer the question in specific terms. 
THE WITNESS:
Very well, Madam President, Your Honours. 
BY MR. MOSES: 
Q.	Do you want me to repeat the question, Witness, or do you remember it?  
A.	Would you please repeat your question, Mr. Prosecutor? 
Q.	Which side of the church was the first to be bulldozed?  Was it the side that faces the Presbytery or was it the side which faces Kibuye road? 
A.	It is the side that faces towards the Kibuye road which was destroyed first. 
Q.	And, approximately, how long after the destruction of the church had commenced was it that you say you saw Father Seromba by the bulldozer? 
A.	Father Seromba arrived when the first wall had just collapsed.  When he heard the wall, sorry, collapse, he came very quickly to berate Rushema and the people accompanying him.  So only a few minutes elapsed before he came. 
Q.	I want to be quite clear on this.  This was definitely - Father Seromba was definitely outside the Presbytery walls when you him at the church, when the church was destroyed, are we quite clear on this? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, the Prosecutor is asking whether Father Seromba was outside of the Presbytery walls or elsewhere.  Father Seromba was coming towards the site when -- he was coming from wherever he was living, that is the most important factor. 
Q.	All right.  So, if we have heard evidence from a number of Defence witnesses who say that they never saw Father Seromba present by the bulldozer and neither heard of such a thing, those people are either mistaken or lying, is that what you are telling the Court? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I am narrating facts which I witnessed and I am also saying -- talking about what I heard.  I saw Father Seromba walking quickly and he seemed to be having a problem because his house had just been destroyed.  He protested and berated Rushema as soon as he reached the site.  As for those witnesses who stated they had not seen Seromba, I -- as far as, I am concerned, I can say that I saw him with my very own eyes when he was talking to Rushema. 
Q.	Now, you have given -- as we have heard various statements -- numerous statements both to the Rwandan authorities, to the ICTR investigators.  You have written to the appeals court in respect of your own case, and you have also provided two statements, haven't you, to the Defence, dated 
	the 22nd of August last year, and the 31st of August, last year?  You agree, that's correct? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, with regard to the statement I belatedly made to the Defence team in August, I am not denying the fact that I met with Defence team, but I would like the Prosecutor to provide me with the statement I allegedly made to the Defence team, for me to be able to take cognisance of it's contents. 
Q.	Well, I don't have the originals, my learned friend has.  Are you able to read French? 
A.	I do not speak French, but since we had qualified interpreters or since we have qualified interpreters at our disposal, you can put questions to me on the subject and I am ready to answer your question. 
Q.	Well, I will put one question and we may have to call it a day for today and we will continue tomorrow morning.  

But Witness, do you agree that you have, prior to meeting the Defence investigators, have never made any written statement of the version that you have testified to in prison, in the recent days that Seromba was attacked and forced by the authorities?  Have you ever mentioned that in any previous statement prior to meeting the Defence, either last year? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, Mr. Prosecutor, I believe, I mentioned the date of my arrest to you.  Any statement where Father Seromba had been attacked would not have been accepted, but when I deemed it was fitting to start making such statements, it's when I started stating that Seromba had been attacked.  I believe several witnesses can corroborate what I am stating. 
MR. MOSES: 
Now, Your Honours, it is probably appropriate to stop here for today and we will commence tomorrow morning. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we shall adjourn for today and resume tomorrow at 9 a.m., when the Prosecutor will continue with his cross-examination.  

Good evening to all of you, and Court stands adjourned.
