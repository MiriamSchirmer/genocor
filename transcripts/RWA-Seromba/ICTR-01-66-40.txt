MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are called to order.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. 

Witness, good afternoon.  I would like to remind you that you are still under oath, Witness.  The Prosecution is going to continue with its cross-examination of you. 

Mr. Prosecutor, you have the floor.
WITNESS BZ4,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued) 
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honours. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, how many days after the attack that you have described where refugees were killed by a grenade, how many days after that attack was it that the church at Nyange was bulldozed? 
A.	It was the next day.  On the next day, the church was destroyed with the bulldozer. 
Q.	And were you told that Kayishema had gone to go and get that bulldozer? 
A.	Yes.  I heard people say that.  They said that Kayishema had brought or had the bulldozer brought to the church. 
Q.	And, according to you, was that -- or the information that you received, was that the same day that the church was bulldozed? 
A.	I knew about it later.  Gradually other people started to say the same thing. 
Q.	Do I understand from that answer that some of the information which you've received is as a result of what other people have told you? 
A.	In regard to the question you asked me earlier, I told you that I heard people say that Kayishema had the bulldozer in question brought to the church.  So my answer was in response to the question you asked me. 
Q.	Now, I want, if I can, just to have -- I'll rephrase that.  Witness, do you remember saying to the Defence, when you spoke to the Defence investigator on the 4th of December last year, that the church had been destroyed on the 14th of April?  Do you remember saying that or not? 
A.	I never mentioned the date regarding an event.  I gave a range of time, and I repeated that yesterday.  I said that it was after the 12th. 
Q.	All right.  Well, what I'm going to ask the French booth to do is to read out from the statement that you made on the 4th of December last year.  It's on page 5 of that statement, and I'd ask that the first three paragraphs of that statement -- of that page be read out and translated for the benefit of us.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"On the 14th of April 1994, criminal investigations officer, IPJ, Fulgence Kayishema, went to fetch the caterpillar.  That was the machine that would later be used to destroy the church.  That person appeared to be the most active official in the commune during the events.  To my knowledge, there was only one caterpillar which was used to destroy the church.  But it was not able to do so in one go.  The caterpillar began to destroy the walls of the church which it knocked down.  Only the tower remained standing.  The assailants at that time had surrounded the church.  Every refugee who tried to escape was hunted down and killed."  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	All right.  Now, Witness, did you hear that translation from that passage of your statement? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And do you agree that you told the Defence that the bulldozing of the church was on the 14th of April?
MR. MONTHÉ:
Objection, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I don't know if the Prosecutor has received an appropriate translation of the paragraphs here.  The 14th of April 1994, IPJ Fulgence Kayishema went to look for the caterpillar.  That was the machine that would later be used to destroy the church.  He never said that it was on the 14th.  It would be later used. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. MOSES:
We've all had it translated officially, not by my learned friend.  We've had an official translation.  I'm putting it to the witness that he has said that this incident was on the 14th.  It's not for my friend to interpret the words there, in my submission, it is clear that the incident that he is referring to took place on the 14th of April, and that's what he said in his statement. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, the Chamber is of the view that, when the witness says that that machine would later be used to destroy the church, it could be on the same day, the next day, or even later.  It's not necessarily the same day.  Could you kindly rephrase your question, therefore. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, did you see the bulldozer arrive at the church? 
A.	Yes, I saw it. 
Q.	How long after you had been at the church did the caterpillar arrive? 
A.	In fact, I can't tell you how much time went by between my arrival and the arrival of the bulldozer.  All I can say is that I arrived before the bulldozer did. 
Q.	Well, what time did you arrive? 
A.	I said that I arrived before noon, but I can't give you an exact time. 
Q.	Well, before noon is a rather large period of time, Witness.  Was it just after breakfast, was it just before lunch?  Are you able to assist us in any way at all? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I didn't have a watch.  It was war time.  I'm not in a position to tell you what time it was, or how long it took me to go from one place to another.  I'm telling you it was before midday.  That's my answer. 
Q.	Well, can we take it from your answer that it's been a long time since this incident.  You don't really recall very well the matters that you are testifying about.  Is that fair to say, that your memory has been affected by the length of time? 
A.	I said that I can't remember the time, the exact time when I arrived.  There are other things regarding those events that I do remember.  And gradually, throughout my testimony, I've been talking about them. 
Q.	Well, on this date, is this -- did you arrive there, as you did the previous day, to see how the situation would develop; is that the reason you went to Nyange on that day?  We're talking about the day that the church was bulldozed.  
A.	Those events occurred in my area.  In the area in which I lived, I knew the people who were involved.  So, when something happens in your area, you will look at the situation closely and figure out how you're going to behave thereafter.  That's what I did. 
Q.	So I've not misunderstood it, your answer that you've just given, do I take it from that that, in summary, yes, your answer is, yes, you did go along there just to see how the situation would develop? 
A.	Yes.  I believe that's what I said.  I went to follow the situation. 
Q.	And you're sure that on that day you didn't go along to join in the attack with the rest of the attackers on the church? 
A.	I could not have participated in the attack.  If somebody accuses me of any participation whatsoever in them, why don't they file a complaint and I'll go before a tribunal to defend myself?  I told you that I was worried about my safety.  I had to be aware of what was going on so that I could know how to react to what was going on.  That's it. 
Q.	All right.  On that day that the church was bulldozed, I'm not going to ask you how many attackers there were because I know that you're not very good with numbers, but are you able to agree with me if I was to say there were at least as many attackers on the day the church was bulldozed as the previous day when the grenades were thrown? 
A.	I said there were many people, many.  But I can't give you an exact number of how many. 
Q.	I understand that.  I'm wanting you, though, if you can think back, to compare in your mind the numbers of attackers on the day the church was destroyed.  Would the numbers of attackers that were there the previous day -- would you agree with me that there were at least the same amount of attackers on the day the church was destroyed as there were the previous day? 
A.	I'm not sure if this is clear.  When you're facing a crowd, standing in front of a crowd back home, you will just say that there were many people.  You won't count them.  This goes for the day before the church was destroyed and the day the church was destroyed.  There were many people on both days. 
Q.	As I understand your evidence last week, you said you observed these events from the commercial centre at Nyange, is that right? 
A.	Which events in particular are you referring to?  Are you referring to the destruction of the church or the incident involving the grenade?  
Q.	I'm now focusing on the day the church was destroyed.  
A.	Yesterday you showed me a photograph.  I believe you asked me to show you where I was standing when the grenade was thrown.  If you know where the centre is, it was lower down, but that's where the grenade was thrown.  But later on, as I have said, people went back into the church and the attackers went after them.  This means that the confrontation changed scene, or site, and therefore I approached the church in order to be able to better see what was happening. 
Q.	All right.  Now, are you talking about -- I -- my questions are -- at the moment are being focused on the events on the day that the church was destroyed, all right?  So can you bear that in mind when you answer the questions.  What -- my understanding of your evidence-in-chief was that you had -- were asked in respect of that day where were you, and that you'd said there was a market in Nyange, a commercial centre.  So, what I'm asking you is that, on the day that the church was destroyed, were you at the Nyange commercial centre? 
A.	Yes.  The day on which the church was destroyed, I was in the neighbourhood of the church. 
Q.	All right.  Well, now I'm going to ask you to be shown a Prosecution Exhibit P. 3-12.  It's a document that you marked yesterday, and I'd ask that you be reshown that document.  Now, there's already -- you've marked that with a number 1 indicating your position on the day that the grenades were thrown.  Are you able to see in that photograph where you were on the day that the church was destroyed? 
A.	No.  I do not see that actual spot on this photograph.  In fact, the place where the church was at the time is not shown on this photograph that I'm seeing now. 
Q.	All right.  Well, perhaps if you can be shown the other photograph, Prosecution exhibit. The photo is a copy of Prosecution Exhibit 3-16.  Does that assist you, Witness, or not, in indicating where you were at Nyange commercial centre on the day the church was destroyed? 
A.	On this photograph I can show you where I was standing. 
Q.	All right.  Perhaps if you could be given a pen.  You've already marked that copy with numbers 1 and 2, so I'm wondering if you could mark it with a number 3.  

All right.  Now, so that we don't get lost with the exhibits, I'll ask if we can produce those documents.  The first one is a copy of Prosecution Exhibit 3-12, which is the first one that you referred to, and I would ask that that be produced as, I think it's Prosecution Exhibit 31, and the other photograph which has been marked by the witness, which is a copy of Prosecution Exhibit P. 3-16, I'd ask that that be produced as Prosecution Exhibit 32.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  Do you have something to say, Mr. Witness?
THE WITNESS:
I wanted to ask that the photograph that I was using to be given back to me so that I can explain something about it. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can that document be given back to the witness, please, Registry. 
THE WITNESS:
I marked the figures 2 and 3 on this photograph.  Yesterday I was asked where the church was found, but just a moment ago I was asked where I was, and there are two figures which are next door to each other, and the Prosecutor should not deduce that I was close to the church.  It's true that the figures are near one another because this is a photograph, but actually, on the spot, physically, the two places are not next to each other as it would appear on this photograph.  That's what I wanted to explain.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.  That will be placed on record. 

Counsel, you do not have any objection, I presume, for the admission of these two documents?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I have no objections. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  These two documents shall be admitted as exhibits for the Prosecution.  P. 3-12 will be admitted as P. 31, and the one from P. 3-16 is going to be admitted as P. 32. 
(Exhibit No. P. 31 admitted)
(Exhibit No. P. 32 admitted)
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honours. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, in your evidence-in-chief you spoke about the death of a person whose name was Gatare.  Do you remember speaking about his death? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Did you actually see him being killed or did someone tell you about that? 
A.	I saw the remains of Gatare in the courtyard close to the church, but I cannot confirm that I saw his actual dying.  But there were many people there as is normal during times of war, but I did see the remains of Gatare. 
Q.	All right.  Now, Witness, you were asked about a list of people and whether you knew them.  Now, in respect of that list, you said that you knew Kayishema, and that he was involved and that you saw him, is that right? 
A.	Yes, that's what I stated. 
Q.	And was that on both days, both the day before the church was destroyed and on the day the church was destroyed? 
A.	Yes.  I saw him both days. 
Q.	All right.  And you were also asked about Ndungutse and you said that he was involved and that you saw him, is that correct? 
A.	I also saw him. 
Q.	And you also saw him on both days? 
A.	Yes, I saw him. 
Q.	And you were asked about a person by the name of Kanyarukiga, and you said that you knew him but that you did not see him, is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  I knew Kanyarukiga, but I did not see him on those two days.  I would see him where he lived in the secteur and the cellule that I mentioned. 
Q.	Would you accept that it's possible that Kanyarukiga was there on one or both days, but you simply didn't or couldn't see him? 
A.	I didn't see him.  Consequently I cannot confirm that it is possible that he was there, or that he was involved in those activities.  I didn't see him, therefore, I can say nothing further. 
Q.	Then you were also asked about a person by the name of Ndahimana, and you said that he was the bourgmestre and that you knew him but you didn't see him during the events at Nyange, am I correct? 
A.	During that period of time I did not see him. 
Q.	You'd agree with me, wouldn't you, Witness, that the bourgmestre was an important person in the commune; in fact, he was the leading communal official? 
A.	Yes.  That was well known.  It was the bourgmestre who was the leader of the whole commune. 
Q.	Would you agree with me, Witness, that it's possible that the bourgmestre was there at Nyange church on one or both days and you simply didn't see him, or couldn't see him? 
A.	I don't know anything about that.  All I know is that I didn't see him. 
Q.	And, really, that's what you're saying about the Accused Seromba; you didn't see him either on either of those days, is that correct? 
A.	I didn't see him either on that day. 
Q.	All right.  Now, you were also asked about a person on a list that was Defence Exhibit 47.  I'm wondering if you could be shown Defence Exhibit 47.  Now, you were asked about a person whose name is beside number 2 on that list.  Now, I don't want you to mention that person's name, but you said, didn't you, that he took part in the events that you have described that took place at Nyange church? 
A.	I stated that, among the active people, this person was included.  That's what I stated. 
Q.	All right.  Okay.  Well, I just want to ask you a few questions about that because, would you agree that he was there both days at Nyange, both the day that the grenades were thrown, and also the day the church was destroyed? 
A.	Yes.  I saw him.  He was present on those two days. 
Q.	Now, in respect of the first day, the day that the grenades were thrown amongst the crowd of refugees, what did you see him doing on that day? 
A.	I cannot be very specific about what I saw him do.  There was a crowd of people and I realised that he was quite active.  It was easy to distinguish one person who was standing aside being a spectator and someone else who was active, but I'm unable to be specific about what exactly he did at the time. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, can you please repeat the question because the end of your question was not interpreted, so can you kindly repeat your question for the record. 
MR. MOSES:
If I can accurately remember it, Your Honours.  It was:   
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, you've said that that person, whose name is beside number 2, was active.  My question was, what did you mean?  What did he do and what did you mean by the words that "he was active"? 
A.	Just a moment ago I had just said that, when I referred to him being active, I didn't mean that I saw him throw a grenade or something like that, but I would see him being mobile and he was very active.  One can easily distinguish someone who is on the side and is being an onlooker, and someone else who is active, someone else who is moving about. 
Q.	So I'm quite clear on that, Witness, when you say, "Moving about and active," do you mean that he was an active participant in the attack that took place that day? 
A.	I cannot say that he participated in the attack, but -- because I observed his movements and I believe he had a role to play in that act.  But I'm not sure that I can say that he was a participant, an active participant in the attack per se. 
Q.	Well, what about during the day the church was destroyed; what did you see him doing on that day? 
A.	As I have stated, I saw him moving about with other people.  For instance, there were some who were encouraging others to participate in those actions.  Consequently, I'm unable to be specific about any act that he committed, but I saw him encouraging the others. 
Q.	Thank you for that, Witness.  One final question:  Can you just confirm for the record that you are Hutu male? 
A.	Yes, I'm Hutu. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. MOSES:
That's the end of the cross-examination, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Mr. Prosecutor. 

Mr. Monthé, do you wish to re-examine your witness?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
No, Madam President.  I will pass, thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we have come to the end of your testimony before this Tribunal.  We thank you sincerely for having come to answer to (sic) the questions which were put to you.  We now wish you a safe return back home, and thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
I also wish to thank you.  
(Witness excused) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is BZ5 available?  It would seem that one of the witnesses is unwell. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, in truth, we have two witnesses who are unwell.  BZ5 apparently has malaria, and there are -- according to the information I received at the end of this morning, YA1 apparently has a problem with diarrhea.  We do not know because this morning he was taken to a competent doctor, but I'm not sure what the sequence of events was.  I came here to Court, but I was only informed by Mr. Fry that the two people were unwell, but I'm not able to tell you what condition he may be in now physically. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel, for this information. 
(Witness entered courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Witness BZ1.  You were already examined by the Defence in-chief, and you are now going to be cross-examined by the Prosecution.  We wish to remind you that you are still under oath, and we ask you to listen to the questions carefully and to try and answer them precisely and in a concise manner. 
THE WITNESS:
I understand, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Witness. 

Madam Prosecution, you have the floor for your cross-examination of Witness BZ1. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours. 



WITNESS BZ1,
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness BZ1.  
A.	Good afternoon. 
Q.	Witness, according to you, what does the word Inyenzi mean? 
A.	During the war that we experienced, Inyenzi meant Tutsi.  Moreover, the Tutsis have given themself -- themselves that name, in fact. 
Q.	Was it not your evidence, Witness, that when the Tutsis were called Inyenzi, they became angry, but they preferred to be called Inkotanyi? 
A.	I don't clearly understand that question, Madam Prosecutor. 
Q.	I will repeat it, Witness.  When you gave evidence here last week, did you say that when Tutsis were called Inyenzi, they became angry.  Was that your evidence? 
A.	What I said is that, if you talk about Inyenzi or Inkotanyi, both labels were given to people who attacked Rwanda.  There were some who weren't happy to be called Inyenzis, they preferred the label Inkotanyi, while others would accept Inyenzi as a label.  For example, you can call me a man and I might become angry, but if you call me a woman, I won't.  It depends on people's personal preference.  When a friend tells you "my dear", you might be happy.  But if someone else calls you "dear", you might get angry.  It completely depends on the person talking to you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, earlier I told you to listen attentively to the questions that are put to you, and attempt to answer them concisely and briefly.  Do not elaborate.  You spoke about Inyenzi and Inkotanyi.  Simply answer the question, do you understand?  
THE WITNESS:
I understand, and I believe that I answered the question.  But responding briefly might depend on the person.  If a teacher asks a student a question, the student might respond briefly, but he might not.  For my part, I'm giving a lengthy answer because I believe that it is correct and concise. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We are simply asking you to make an effort, to not give answers that are too lengthy. 

Madam Prosecutor, you may proceed. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Obliged, Madam President. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Isn't it true, Witness, that some Tutsis did not like to be called Inyenzi because Inyenzi was another word for an insect, like a cockroach? 
A.	I don't know why those Tutsis were unhappy.  They should explain the matter. 
Q.	Whilst you were in Rwanda before you left the country, did you ever hear anyone refer to the word Inyenzi as meaning a cockroach? 
A.	At any rate, in French there is a figurative meaning and in Kinyarwanda Inyenzi does, in fact, mean an insect.  That's what it means.  That's what Inyenzi means; it's an insect. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, I know your evidence was a long time ago, so I would ask you if this, in fact, was your evidence.  But did you say last week, Witness, that Tutsis started to flee their homes around the 10th of April?  Was that your evidence? 
A.	You're putting words into my mouth.  I remember that I said that the Tutsis began to flee towards the church between the 9th and the 10th.  I can't be specific with regard to the date when the Tutsis left their homes. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  Did you, yourself, see these Tutsis who fled to the church? 
A.	I saw some. 
Q.	Isn't it true, Witness, that at this time Tutsis were fleeing their homes at night? 
A.	I have no idea.  Everyone seized the appropriate moment to flee.  I don't know if there were those who fled during the day or during the night. 
Q.	Can you assist us, Witness, you said you saw some Tutsis flee.  Can you tell us approximately how many Tutsis you said you saw flee? 
A.	I don't clearly understand your question, Madam President.  Could you repeat it for me?
Q.	How many Tutsis did you see with your own eyes flee their homes? 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, I did not see the Tutsis leave their homes.  I saw Tutsis going to the church.  I did not see any who were leaving their homes.  Moreover, I didn't count how many of them there were.  I was in Nyange.  I can't specify how many Tutsis were fleeing. 
Q.	Were you present at the church -- is it your evidence that you were present at the church when the Tutsis first began to arrive at the church? 
A.	Let me repeat it:   I saw Tutsis taking refuge at the church on the dates I've already mentioned. 
Q.	When you saw these Tutsis, where were you? 
A.	I was in Nyange when I saw them. 
Q.	And, Witness, was that during the Mass that you spoke of? 
A.	At any rate, I saw them in the month of April.
Q.	Is it your evidence, Witness, and I want to be very clear about what is your evidence, but is it your evidence, Witness, that when you first arrived at the church, there were no refugees.  Do I understand you clearly? 
A.	You're talking about when I arrived at the church.  I'm telling you that I saw the refugees go there, so that means there were refugees at the church. 
Q.	Witness, if you would listen to my question very carefully and I will repeat it:   I'm asking you if, when you arrived at the church around the 10th of April 1994, whether the refugees were already there, or whether, whilst you were there, you saw them coming to the church.  
A.	I told you that I could see the Tutsis going to the church at the time I was at Nyange.  You can find that information in my statement.  I don't know what answer you want me to give. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, you're being asked to listen closely to the question and to try to answer them specifically.  When you say "Nyange", were you at home or were you at the church?  The Prosecutor is asking you, when you arrived at the church, if there were refugees at the church, or did the refugees begin to arrive after your arrival?  It seems to me that is the sense of the Prosecutor's question. 
THE WITNESS:
When I'm speaking about the place where I was, I mean, in fact, the commercial centre. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Therefore, Witness, are we to understand that, when the refugees arrived at Nyange parish church, you were not at the church? 
A.	Up until now, I said that I was in Nyange and I saw the refugees go to the church.  I saw them go to the church, and I remember when I went to Mass, I heard the priest say that we had to assist those refugees who didn't have any food to eat. 
Q.	Witness, I'm going to show you a photograph, and I want you to say to this Court whether the commercial district you just spoke of, whether it is, indeed, there.  
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, Your Honours, for the record, I am showing the witness a photocopy of what has been already entered into evidence as Prosecution Exhibit 3-12.  
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, the commercial district you just mentioned, do you see that commercial district on that photograph? 
A.	What I see on the photograph, of course, there have been some changes since this photograph was taken, is a building which housed the statue of the Virgin Mary, and another building which housed a co-operative.  It seems to me there have been some changes. 
Q.	Do you recognise the buildings at the bottom of that photograph as part of the commercial centre you spoke of? 
A.	I haven't seen these buildings in a long time.  Even so, it seems there is a tarred road.  It went through the centre, the commercial centre.  I can see the buildings, but I can't clearly identify them.  They are buildings to the left and to the right of the tarred road. 
Q.	Let us look at another photograph and see if you can be of some assistance.  
MS. ALEXIS:
Can the witness be shown what -- if I may see Prosecution Exhibit 3-16.  Yes, might the witness be shown what was marked and tendered as Prosecution Exhibit 3-16. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	I hope that photograph is clear, Witness.  If you see the commercial centre or the area where the commercial centre was on that photograph, if at all it is there, can you point it out to this Court?  
A.	This photograph is not clear for me.  I can't identify the place. 
Q.	Very well, Witness. 
MS.  ALEXIS:
Might the photocopies be taken away until further reference?  Thank you.  
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	But you would agree with me -- but you would agree with me, would you not, Witness, that the commercial centre and Nyange parish church, although they are close by, they are not in exactly the same place? 
A.	From where the church is located and where the commercial centre is located, there is a distance of between 80 and 100 metres. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, wasn't the church, Nyange church, located on top of a hill? 
A.	It's not a hill as such, but to get to the church, you have to go up and you will get to the church.  Yes, the centre was below the location of the church. 
Q.	So, Witness, I'm now going back -- having established that, we are now going back, to be fair to you, to the day of the 10th of April 1994.  On this day when you said the refugees arrived, did you know where Athanase Seromba was when the refugees first arrived to Nyange parish church? 
A.	I don't know on which day the refugees arrived for the first time, but I do know that we were at morning Mass.  There I could see Athanase Seromba. 
Q.	Witness, didn't you say that, when the refugees arrived, that you were at the commercial centre? 
A.	I don't know if the refugees that I saw were the first ones to arrive.  What I do know is that I was at the commercial centre when the refugees were on their way to the church. 
Q.	Those refugees whom you saw pass by when you were at the commercial centre, you do not know how they were greeted when they arrived at the church, isn't that so? 
A.	Given what Father Seromba said to the effect that there was rice from CARITAS, I believe that they were welcomed, and they were given the supplies that were available. 
Q.	However, Witness, would you agree with me that, since it is your evidence that you were not at the church, but that you were at the commercial centre, you did not witness how these refugees were greeted when they first arrived? 
A.	To say that I was not a witness to those facts is untrue.  There were guards, for example, who might be next to the football field and they can say they will have seen such and such a player.  To say that I did not witness these things is untrue.  That's not what I said. 
Q.	I don't want to misquote you, Witness, but then is it your evidence that from 80 to 100 metres away, at the bottom of the hill, you were able to see how the refugees were greeted in the church; is that your evidence? 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
MR. MONTHÉ:
I fear the witness may not have understood the question.  I heard in my headset 8000 metres. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam President, could you repeat your question for the benefit of the booths?  
MS. ALEXIS:
Certainly, Madam President.  
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, I do not wish to misquote you.  Is it therefore your evidence that, from the bottom of the hill, some 80 to 100 metres away from the church that you were able to see how the refugees were greeted when they first arrived at that church.  Is that your evidence? 
A.	I don't know if you know Nyange commercial centre.  Wouldn't you be able to see the people going to the church?  You've already said this.  Let me repeat it.  I believe that they were given a warm welcome because, during the Mass, Father Seromba said that the refugees had arrived and they didn't have enough supplies.  He asked, therefore, Christians to support him.  So, if the priest said such things, that means to me that they received a warm welcome. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  I thank you for that response.  Since you have been speaking about what Athanase Seromba said at the Mass, can you tell us on that day, that first day when Athanase Seromba said that the parishioners must help the refugees, did you, yourself, witness with your own eyes Athanase Seromba giving food to these refugees? 
A.	I heard him say those things during the Mass.  But to say that I saw him distribute supplies, I can't say that.  After Mass, I went home.  I had things to do. 
Q.	Was it your evidence, Witness, that Athanase Seromba came to Nyange parish at the end of 1993, around the month of October; was that your evidence? 
A.	From what I know, he came in the third quarter of 1993.  So I believe that October and November are included in that third quarter. 
Q.	You also said, Witness, and you can confirm or not, that, when he said that he was leaving, and I'm referring here to Athanase Seromba, that all the faithful of the church asked him to remain and not to leave; do you remember that evidence, Witness? 
A.	What I said, and I will repeat it, is that when he told us "goodbye", many did not want him to leave, because they liked him.  They held him in high esteem. 
Q.	Witness, in Kivumu commune, would you agree with me that a large proportion of the population was Catholic? 
A.	Generally the majority of the population was Catholic. 
Q.	And, as well, the majority of the population, as far as you know, attended Nyange Catholic church; would you agree with that? 
A.	Well, you can be Catholic and non-practising.  It was not only the Catholic church.  There were other denominations. 
Q.	But didn't you just say, Witness, that the majority of the population of Kivumu commune was, in fact, Catholic?  Was that not your evidence? 
A.	Yes.  Most of the people were Catholics.

1530H 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	So, Witness, would you agree with me though that Athanase Seromba came to Nyange parish only in 1993, but he was a priest who was well-known in Kivumu commune? 
A.	You are saying that he was well-known; well, those who knew him were those who regularly went to church.  Of course, there were other people who lived around the church.  They know him as well without a doubt.
Q.	Would you agree with me, Witness, from what you know, that the members of the 
	Nyange Catholic Church respected and admired Athanase Seromba? 
A.	Parishioners at Nyange church held Father Seromba in high esteem, I will confirm that. 
Q.	On that first day, Witness, I know you said you cannot recall the exact number, and so I am asking you to listen very carefully to my question.  I am not asking to give an exact figure.  On that first day, around the 10th of April 1994, were there less refugees than you saw when you went to the church a few days later? 
A.	I don't know whether you understood me properly.  I told you that I saw people take refuge in that place.  I also said that I would to go that place to attend Mass, and after Mass I went home. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  On the next day, that is assuming that the day you went was the 10th, on the next day, the 11th of April 1994, did you go to the church to attend Mass, again? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  The following day, I also went to that day's Mass.
Q.	And on the 12th, on the 12th, the following day, did you again return to Mass? 
A.	No.  I no longer went to Mass. 
Q.	Who was the priest who said the Mass was on the 11th of April 1994? 
A.	It was Father Seromba who said the Mass was on that day.
Q.	Then would you agree with me, Witness, that on the 11th, that on the 11th of April 1994, there were more refugees at the church than there had been on the 10th? 
A.	I remember that on that day, when I was attending Mass, I remember that it was the last Mass that I attended.  At that time Father Seromba were telling us that many refugees had arrived.  It was on that occasion that he asked parishioners to help the refugees because the stock of rice which had been given by CARITAS had run out.  
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness, but if you would be so kind so as to answer my question, I repeat it.  My questions are this Witness, on the 11th of April 1994, were there more refugees than there had been on the 10th of April 1994? 
A.	Yes, I also answered you by saying that the refugees were more at the church in comparison to the previous day.  That's quite logical.  People continued to flock to the church to come and seek refuge at the time just like spectators going to a football pitch before a football match.  I think that is quite logical and anyone can understand that. 
Q.	Witness, if you assist me; according to you, Athanase Seromba appealed to the parishioners to help the refugees both on the 10th and 11th of April - - or was it only the 11th? 
A.	What I said is that since the arrival of the refugees at the church, Father Seromba was encouraging Christians to come to the assistance of the refugees during the Masses he said.  Normally, I knew that he was something --someone generous and I knew that their food stocks were not without limit.  Therefore, he was calling upon or appealing to Christians telling them that he was looking for something for assistance to refugees and each person was being asked to provide assistance according to his or her own means.
Q.	Yes, Witness, thank you.  But very simply and it is open to you to answer this yes or no:  Did he, Athanase Seromba, make this appeal both on the 10th and the 11th? 
A.	On that day, I heard him say as much. 
Q.	When you attended Mass on the 10th of April 1994, aside from Athanase Seromba, did you see any other priest? 
A.	I only saw Father Seromba.  He was the one who said Mass.  
Q.	On the next day, the 11th of April 1994, aside from Athanase Seromba, did you see any other priest?  
A.	Actually, since the refugees had come to the church to seek refuge, the only priest I saw there was Father Athanase Seromba. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  The next time you returned to Nyange Parish Church, is it true that the refugees were being attacked? 
A.	At a given point and time, I went back and I was close to the secretariat building, and it at that time that people came and they were trying to intimidate Seromba, and they were calling him an Inkotanyi because he was also sheltering Inkotanyi.  They were demanding that he surrender these Inkotanyi.    Thus when I found myself there, but I didn't see anything else being done by those people.  I didn't know them and they were armed with clubs.  And when I saw them, I took detour and I left the place and they began to insult him calling him Inyenzi and other names.    So, I decided to go away. 
Q.	On that day, according to you when Athanase Seromba was called names, how long did you spend -- how much time, sorry, did you spend at the church premises? 
A.	I didn't go back home immediately.  Instead, I went down below to the centre. 
Q.	And according to you, at this time, where exactly was Athanase Seromba? 
A.	During that incident, I told you that I was at the secretariat.  There was a building which housed the secretariat.  So these people came and they stood in front of the door.  As for his position, I would say that he was in the area because I could hear what was being said to him. 
Q.	Did you see Athanase Seromba at that time, that is, according to you, when insults were being thrown at him? 
A.	At any rate, I am telling you that those people were speaking to him.  I can't say that I certainly saw him, but when they were speaking to him, I could hear what they saying.  In fact, I could say I had a glance of him - - he came - - there was crowd of people, and I immediately left the place. 
Q.	When you had this glance at Athanase Seromba, where was he? 
A.	These people were close to the door or the entrance to the building where he lived and he was inside the building in which he normally lived. 
Q.	Did you actually see him with your own eyes; that is my question? 
A.	I told you that I had a glance of him, but so there is a difference between seeing somebody and having a glance of him. 
Q.	When you had this glance of him, did he come outside so that you may have a glance at him? 
A.	I am saying that I had a brief glance of him because I was afraid seeing all these machetes that these people were armed with. 
Q.	Where were you, exactly, when you had this glance of him? 
A.	I have told you that I was close by that building near which these people had come. 
Q.	Would it be true to say, Witness, that at this time Athanase Seromba was outside on the road?  Would that be a true statement? 
A.	No, that's not the truth. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  
MS. ALEXIS: 
Madam President, if you would give me one moment. 
BY MS. ALEXIS: 
Q.	You spoke, Witness, of going to the church only and seeing the refugees being attacked with grenades.  Do you remember saying this? 
A.	I didn't quite understand your question.  I would be grateful, Counsel, if you could repeat for me. 
Q.	I certainly will.  Was it your evidence, Witness, that at one time someone threw a grenade in the crowd of refugees?  Was that your evidence? 
A.	I think you want to ask me questions referring to the beginning of the killings.  I have stated that given the fact that the refugees appeared to be stronger than the attackers, one of the attackers had to throw a grenade into the crowd of refugees.
Q.	On this day in which an attacker -- well, firstly, this person who threw the grenade, was his name Rukara? 
A.	Frankly, I do not know the name.
Q.	Did you ever hear, Witness, that the person who threw the grenade was an army reservist? 
A.	What I know is that someone threw a grenade.  As for the identity of the individual who threw this, I never got to know.  Furthermore, I never even asked for any information in that regard. 
Q.	Witness, I am trying to locate your evidence.  Is it your evidence that this grenade attack took place on the day before the church was destroyed? 
A.	In my testimony, I said that the incident concerning the throwing of the grenade is one of the incidents I witnessed and that incident happened on the day previous to the one on which the church was destroyed. 
Q.	On that day, what time did you get to the church? 
A.	Are you speaking about the day on which the grenade was thrown in the crowd of the refugees?  Which day are referring to, Counsel?  
Q.	I am speaking of that day, Witness, when the grenade was thrown? 
A.	The day of the incident of the grenade, I reached the centre at about 9 or 10, between 9 and 10 in the morning.
Q.	When you say you reached the centre, Witness, on that day, the day when the grenades -- I am sorry, when the grenade was thrown, did you reach to the commercial centre or did you reach to the church itself? 
A.	On that day, I reached the commercial centre, and when I arrived there, I found many people there who seemed to be involved in some kind of conflict.
Q.	Theses people who seemed to be involved in some kind of conflict, were they at the commercial centre with you or were they around the church? 
A.	When I got to the place, the refugees had come out, and they were being attacked by other people.  The people who were attacking the refugees were at the centre and the refugees had come further down and the two groups were throwing stones at one another. 
Q.	At this time, Witness, when the two groups were throwing stones at one another, were the attackers armed with traditional weapons? 
A.	They were armed with machetes, spears, and clubs and, of course, others were using stones in order to attack.  
Q.	On this day, the day when the grenade was thrown, at -- isn't it true, Witness, that you never approached the church, that you remained at the commercial centre? 
A.	When I reached there, the refugees were at the church.  You should rather ask me the time at which I reached the church.
MS. ALEXIS: 
Madam President, the answer of the witness was so unrelated to my question that I am hard-pressed even to remember my question.  I move on. 
BY MS ALEXIS: 
Q.	At the time when the grenade was thrown, the attackers were - where, exactly, were you standing?  Were you standing on the side of the attackers or were you standing on the side of the refugees? 
A.	I was behind them.  
Q.	Witness, when you say you were behind them, who is the "them", you were referring to? 
A.	I am referring to the attackers.  I was behind the attackers. 
Q.	How far behind the attackers were you? 
A.	You are asking me the distance between me and the attackers.  Well, it depended, depending on the time.  They were moving in all directions as do ants.   Consequently, given the situation, I cannot answer your question about the distance between me and the attackers who were continually on the move.
Q.	Witness, let us go back to what you said, you saw some armed persons throwing insults at 
	Athanase Seromba.  That would have been the day before the grenade attack; isn't that so? 
A.	At any rate, that incident happened before the one involving the grenade being thrown. 
Q.	My question is:  When you say "before", did it happen on the same day or was it the day before? 
A.	What I remember is that when these people --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
I am sorry, I am a bit lost, I didn't quite understand.  I must have missed a word in there.  Could the witness be asked to repeat the question?  
THE WITNESS:
It is difficult to know the precise day.  We are trying to remember the events themselves.  But as for the days on which these events took place, it's difficult to be precise. 
MS. ALEXIS: 
Madam President, there was a problem with the interpretation.  I heard in English, the English interpreter saying that she was not following the witness.  So perhaps, for the purposes of the record, if the witness can repeat his answer.  She heard "ant", but she -- I heard in English through the headset that she said she had not heard the beginning.  So if I may --  
BY MS. ALEXIS: 
Q.	Witness, our apologies, all of our response was not quite heard.  Can you repeat your last answer please, and try not to speak too quickly. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, it would be better if the Prosecution can repeat the question because I, myself, I am a bit lost.  I don't even know where we are anymore. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you please repeat your question?  
MS. ALEXIS:
Very well, Madam President, I will. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	My question is this, Witness:  When according to you, Athanase Seromba was threatened, was that on the day before or prior to the day on which the grenade was thrown? 
A.	I answered by saying that to best of my recollection, he was threatened before the grenade was thrown.  But as for the days, I no longer recall.  I can no longer recall precise days. 
Q.	But you are sure, Witness, when he was threatened, he was inside the presbytery.  Was that your evidence? 
A.	I told you that when I had a glance of him, he was at the presbytery and then you asked me putting it to me that he was outside, and I answered in the negative.  Now, when I say in the presbytery, I mean in the compound.  You shouldn't understand that he was in a room or in a particular room. 
Q.	But when -- sorry Interpreter. When you said he was in the compound, do you mean that he was inside the four walls of the presbytery?  Was he inside the presbytery building? 
A.	I told you that he was inside the presbytery. 
MS. ALEXIS:  
Madam President might, and I have given a copy of this to the interpreters - - might one paragraph from the witness's statement be read to him, that is, the declaration of the witness of the 
3rd of December 2004, and it is the first paragraph on page 5.  But before -- and that is the paragraph I intend to have read to the witness.  But I will ask a few preliminary questions before I get there.  But just to indicate to the interpreters, it is the first paragraph on page 5 ending with -- sorry, beginning with, "Vers le 13" and ending with "beaucoup de réfugies",  well, the interpreter will be able better to understand.
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, didn't you give two statements to the Defence investigators in this matter? 
A.	Yes, sir. That is correct. 
Q.	And you signed both statements; didn't you? 
A.	Yes, that is correct, I signed both statements. 
Q.	Very well.  I want you to listen to this paragraph. 
MS. ALEXIS:  
Might the interpreter read the paragraph that I have just indicated?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Beginning of the reading, "Towards the 13th of April 1994, Father Seromba was threatened by attackers armed with machetes, and other traditional weapons asking him to deliver the refugees to them because they were members of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (PRF). On that day, he was outside on the street when this armed group of attackers came from the commune centre to threaten 
Father Seromba because at that point in time there many refugees."   End of the paragraph. 
MS. ALEXIS:  
Thank you very much, Madam Interpreter. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, have you heard the reading of the paragraph? 
A.	But, there is something I do not agree with in the paragraph.  At one point, they said he was outside or something like that, when an attack was launched.  No, I don't agree with that. 
Q.	But, would you agree with me, Witness, that were, in fact, what you told the Defence investigators that Father Seromba was at the time on the road? 
A.	When they said he was outside, there are several ways to understand that.  There is a fence somewhere.  You are still in the compound, if you were still inside.  I spoke about people who came from the commune.  I don't believe that was what I said.  Those aren't my words.  
MS. ALEXIS:
Sorry, Interpreters. 
BY MS. ALEXIS: 
Q.	But, Witness, I had specifically asked you, and that is why I asked these questions so carefully, whether at the time Athanase Seromba was inside the four walls of the presbytery?    Didn't you respond that he was inside the building of the presbytery, Witness? 
A.	I said he was at the presbytery.  That's what I said.  
Q.	Witness, did this incident occur at all since at one point he is in the road and another point he is within the gates and another point he is in the building?  Did this incident occur at all? 
A.	We've just read a document; it talks about people who came from the communal office. I don't know where that comes from.  
Q.	So, Witness, am I, therefore, to understand that in the paragraph that I read from your statement, there are two things that you did not see.  That is, that Athanase Seromba was in the road, and that the assailants had come from the commune; is that what you are saying? 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Monthé. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
I have an objection regarding the Prosecutor's approach.  On page 5, she is taking a paragraph out of its context. If the Prosecutor wishes to put a proposition to the witness, she has to use the entire context.  If you refer to paragraph 3 which is a corollary in large part to the sequence of events, you see that in that day Father Seromba went to the presbytery to ask the authorities to reinforce the security of the parish to defend the refugees.  Consequently, the refugees -- the witness is not contradicting himself.  She has to read the entire statement in order to put questions to this witness. If the extract is simply a bit of the statement, of course, it loses its cohesion, its coherence.  That is the objection the Defence wishes to raise, Madam President. 
MS. ALEXIS: 
Madam President cannot claim that I was unfair to the witness.  The bit of the evidence that was in contention for me began at, "Ce jour là".  I purposely asked the interpreters as they did to read from the beginning of the paragraph.  I cannot imagine that counsel is suggesting that I read the entire statement for the witness and, in any event, what counsel has just read is unrelated to the issue that I am presently dealing with.   Counsel is the one who had original possession of this statement.  If counsel wishes to clear up anything, it is open to him to do so in re-examination.  

But, Madam President, my apologies, Madam President, but, Madam President, at this juncture, I cannot agree with counsel that my question is not permissible, is not admissible or is in any way unfair to the witness. 

MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, with your leave. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Nekuie. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
To reply to the Prosecution, Madam President, I want to point out and talk about her own exhibit.  There was a sketch and in that sketch, it was very clear that within the presbytery compound, there was a hedge or trail.  They spoke of a trail within the presbytery compound.  So when talking about there a road here, that's the same trail which is inside the path, inside that compound.  I simply wanted to raise this for the Prosecution and refer them back to their very own exhibit. 
MS. ALEXIS: 
Madam President, I just wish to say that what Counsel Nekuie has just done is giving evidence from the Bar table.  It is the witness, BZ1, who is to give evidence, and not Counsel Nekuie. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, you may proceed.  

Mr. Nekuie, you can get to that issue when you re-examine this witness.
MS. ALEXIS:
I am obliged to you, Madam President.  In any event, I have finished with that point.  Sorry, 
Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, indeed, I was going to point out that this is the normal time for the break.  Do you have many remaining questions for this witness? 
MS. ALEXIS: 
I have a few questions left, but certainly, Madam President, it would be a good time for the break because what I can do in the break is to look over my questions and try to make them go as quickly as possible. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you.  

The proceedings are adjourned for a few minutes. 
(Court recessed from 1600H to 1636H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are resumed. 

Madam Prosecutor, you have the floor.

MS ALEXIS: 
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MS. ALEXIS: 
Q.	Witness, on the day that the grenade was thrown, did you see the bourgmestre of your commune? 
A.	I can't hear you. 
Q.	My apologies, Witness.  Perhaps I was speaking too softly.  On the day that the grenade was thrown, did you on that day see the bourgmestre of your commune? 
A.	I didn't hearing the translation. 
Q.	Are you hearing now, Witness? 
A.	Yes, I can hear you.  
Q.	Okay. I asked you if, on the day the grenade was thrown, if you saw on that day the bourgmestre of your commune. 
A.	Yes, I saw him. 
Q.	And on that same day, the day the grenade was thrown, did you see Télephore Ndungutse? 
A.	I also saw him. 
Q.	And did you see the IPJ of your commune? 
A.	Yes, him too. 
Q.	Do you know somebody named Gaspard Kanyarukiga? 
A.	I know him. 
Q.	On the day the grenade was thrown, did you see him? 
A.	Yes, I saw him as well. 
Q.	Did you ever well -- you said, Witness that you were at the commercial centre when the grenade was thrown.  Did you ever go close to the church or next to the church on that day? 
A.	The day when the grenade was thrown, I didn't approach the church. 
Q.	Can you tell us, Witness, approximately what time you left the commercial centre on this day, that is, the day the grenade was thrown? 
A.	I left centre about 6 p.m. 
Q.	On that day, Witness, would you agree with me that there were thousands of attackers who were present and attacking the refugees? 
A.	What I can say is that there were many attackers. 
Q.	Witness, before I move on, I want to go back - - a little back to ask you a question:  On the 
	10th of April 1994, do you remember what time you attended Mass? 
A.	Normally, we went to Morning Mass.  It began at six in the morning.  I believe I was at church at about that time.
Q.	And on the next day, the 11th of April 1994, did you also attend Mass at six? 
A.	You just asked me the same question the third time.  I told you that I went to the church to go to Mass. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
If I have understood correctly, there was a small mistake with regard to the time.  It was six in the morning and not six in the evening.  

Thank you. 
MS. ALEXIS:  
Madam President, shall I repeat the questions?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you can repeat the question. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Very well, Madam President, I will do so. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:  
Q.	Witness, if you bear with us.  There was a small interpretation problem.  On the 11th of April 1994, did you attend Mass at 6 a.m.?  
A.	I told you that you asked me that question three times.  I did go to that Mass and every time you have asked me that question I have given you the same answer. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  On the day the church was destroyed, you again went to the church; didn't you? 
A.	The day the church was demolished, I had arrived when the bulldozer was knocking down the tower. 
Q.	So that - - it is your evidence that when the destruction began, you were not there? 
A.	What I am saying is that I did not see the bulldozer begin to destroy the church. 
Q.	You said, Witness that, well, before I ask that question, I would rephrase:  On the 6th -- on the day the church was destroyed, what time did you arrive there? 
A.	The day the church was demolished, I arrived at the Nyange commercial centre between nine and ten.  When I was at the commercial centre, I didn't go directly to the church.  I remained there at the commercial centre.
Q.	But on that day, the day the church was demolished; did you go up close to where the church was being demolished? 
A.	I arrived when the bulldozer was in the process of destroying the bell tower. 
Q.	So, Witness, when the bulldozer was requisitioned, you were not present; isn't that so? 
A.	What I said in my statement was that the people who brought the bulldozer were the communal officials including Kayishema and Ndungutse.  They were the ones who brought the equipment.  I did not see the beginning of the church demolition. I was at the Nyange commercial centre. 
Q.	Witness, I am going to read, - - well, you said you were not there when they began to destroy the church, but did you see when the bulldozer arrived at the church? 
A.	In my statement, I said that I saw the bulldozer demolish the church.  Could you see such a thing without the bulldozer arriving at the site?  
Q.	I am not sure I understand your evidence, Witness.  I am going to tell you what my understanding of your evidence is.  You said to me and to this Court, that when the destruction of the church began, you were not there.  And I, being fair, is that what you said, Witness? 
A.	I said that when the bulldozer began to demolish the church, I was not there.  The bulldozer was brought to bury the dead bodies that were in the area.  It -- before that it was brought to bury the bodies.  The reason the bulldozer was brought in, in fact, changed.  It was later used to demolish the church, but I was not at the church.  I was instead at the Nyange commercial centre.  
Q.	On this day, the day when the church was destroyed, did you again see Kayishema, Ndahimana and Ndungutse? 
A.	Yes, I saw them again. 
Q.	It is true, Witness that on that day, that is the day when the church was being destroyed, that you heard people saying, and "Let's destroy the church?" 
A.	According to what I heard, the people said, "There were people inside of the church.  We can get to them," they said.  So a decision was made to demolish the church.  The order was given to the bulldozer driver to demolish the church. 
Q.	And at the time, when this decision was made, you remained at the commercial centre; isn't that so? 
A.	I told you that I went to the church on the day it was demolished.  And I arrived at the time the bulldozer was in the process of destroying the tower.  I don't know if you have understood me correctly.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, on both days, and let me be specific; on the day the church was destroyed and on the day before the church was destroyed, did you go to that area to be one of the attackers on the refugees? 
A.	I did not go there as an attacker.  At any rate, when an incident takes place in your area, you would try to find out what is going on.  These are unfortunate events, but we had to seek information.  I was not going to stay at home while unfortunate events were occurring.
Q.	So, again, Witness, on both days, the day the church was destroyed and on the day before the church was destroyed, you did not go there to look for Athanase Seromba; did you? 
A.	I did not leave with the intention to see Seromba.  Instead, I went to watch the unfolding of the 
	tragic events.  On those two days, I did not see Seromba. 
Q.	Witness, are you Hutu? 
A.	Yes, I am Hutu. 
Q.	Witness, haven't come to this Trial Chamber merely to help Athanase Seromba, and isn't that why you said he was threatened and that he said that the refugees should help? 
A.	I have come here to talk about the events which occurred back home in area.  I have come to shed light on who was responsible, that is why I am here before this Chamber. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness. 
MS. ALEXIS: 
Madam President, Your Honours, these are all my questions to this witness.  I - - to have of this witnessed. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor.  

Mr. Nekuie, do you have any re-examination for this witness? 
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, with your leave, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You have the floor, Counsel. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Madam President. 
RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness BZ1, good afternoon.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness BZ1, I know that this is a tedious exercise, but we do have a few questions for you to clarify some of the testimony that you have given before this Chamber.  Do you understand what I am asking of you? 
A.	Yes, I understand, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness BZ1, during the cross-examination and even in the examination-in-chief, you said that you were a Catholic and that you were a regular at the Nyange parish; is that correct? 
A.	That's correct. 
MS. ALEXIS: 
Madam President, might I remind counsel that re-examination has a particular end, that re-examination is necessary when there has been ambiguity about an issue.  On this issue, there has been no ambiguity and so it is my submission that this is not a fit and proper question for re-examination.   
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, Your Honours, could the Prosecutor kindly refrain from putting words into my mouth with regard to the questions I am putting to the witness.  There was some uncertainty on - - with regard to the presbytery.  That is what I am trying to clear up, Madam President, and this is the matter the Defence is going to use and not any matter suggested to us by the Prosecution.  She should not be interested in how I wish to proceed.  I am going not to issues that have not been specified, but rather to issues that are not clear.  That is my purpose, Madam President, and that is my response to any objection.
(Pages 15 to 26 by Petrus Chijarira)




1700H 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Counsel Nekuie. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness BZ1, as a Christian, therefore, you regularly went to Nyange parish.  Are you familiar with the geographical layout of the parish? 
A.	Yes, I know the layout of the parish. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  So you can describe for us exactly how the presbytery was laid out.  Was the presbytery fenced in or was it a single-standing building?
A.	It was fenced, inside there was a two-storey building, it seemed to be a two-storey building, at least.  That is how I can describe the area. 
Q.	Thank you, sir.  In that fenced area, was there any space or a trail that one could call a road? 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, I object because it appears to me that counsel is taking another opportunity to continue an examination-in-chief.  All of these issues were issues which it was open to counsel to raise during his examination-in-chief.  And it is my view that these issues surrounding the layout of the church and the surrounding area whether the presbytery had a fence, these issues are not, in fact, issues that are in contention.  And counsel is merely continuing an examination-in-chief.  And that these questions are not fit questions for re-examination. 
MR. NEKUIE:
May I respond, Madam President?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may, Counsel.  
MR. NEKUIE:  
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, once again let me point out that during the cross-examination the Prosecutor pointed out terms in the witness's statement as it was drafted by the Defence team.  To clarify these matters we have a duty before this Honourable Chamber to figure out exactly what the witness meant in his statement.  And I do believe this matter came up during the cross-examination.  And the document that we are using completely authorises me to raise these issues to clarify them before the Chamber. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, when you were cross-examining the witness you raised the matter according to which the witness had said that Father Seromba had gone out.  Now, I don't know whether you recall when the Defence had raised an objection and they said -- the Defence said that the Defence will have to come back to this issue during the re-examination of the witness, because you had the right of putting that question.  And we said, indeed, you had the right to raise the issue which may be considered as a contradiction in the statement of the witness; but that the Defence will, during their re-examination of the witness, come back to this same issue.  Do you recall this whole matter?  
MS. ALEXIS:
Yes, please, Madam President, in fact, I do.  And my issue is not that the Defence does not have a right to re-examine.  My issue is how the Defence is going about it.  There is -- there is an issue which has to do with ambiguity.  The Defence, in my view, must pinpoint what this ambiguity is and ask questions only in relation to that ambiguity.  Madam President, the ambiguity, in my mind, had nothing to do with whether the witness was a Catholic and whether he knew the layout of the area.  I had specifically asked the witness if when he said, Father Seromba was in the presbytery if he meant within the four walls of the presbytery.  The witness said, "Yes."   It was when I put to the witness what was in his statement that Father Seromba was in the road, that he then said, "A road can mean other things, perhaps it was in the fence."

If counsel were to pinpoint his questions to that particular area, I would have no objection.  Counsel, however, in my view, is going on a bit of a fishing trip, and that is why I find myself constrained to object.  So, of course, Madam President, Your Honours, you are perfectly right as to your recall of what had occurred with the cross-examination and with the statement.  So that my objection is based not on whether counsel has a right, but my objection is based on the manner in which counsel is carrying about this right.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nekuie, can you reformulate your question by trying to focus specifically on the point which was raised?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, I shall comply to your request, but however, I would wish to say that it is not up to the Prosecutor to prescribe the approach to be adopted by the Defence in its work.  And if the Prosecutor were following the development of this case, she should recall that before this very Chamber, in this same trial, Mr. Townsend, who was in her place had to proceed with a re-examination whose objective was to reestablish the witness who had provided many points of contradictions.  And I am complying with what has already happened in your jurisdiction, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Counsel. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness BZ1, please, can you tell us whether you indicated to this Chamber whether Father Seromba was -- whether you stated that he was actually inside of the presbytery? 
A.	First of all, when I was asked the question, it wasn't clear.  Mention was made of people who had come from the bourgmestre's place and other things, but I responded that I had a glimpse of him.  Then there was mention of a road.  Now as far as I am concerned I stated that Father Seromba had gone to fetch the authorities in order to tell them about the situation which was overwhelming for him.  Something was read to me at that time and I didn't quite understand it. 
Q.	Thank you.  In that presbytery, was there something which for you would resemble a road? 
A.	There were corridors. 
Q.	Can you be more specific when you refer to a term "corridors"? 
A.	What I mean to say is that from one building to another there would be alleys or pathways, and that is what one could probably refer to as a road.  And it is, in fact, the space that one uses when one is moving from one building to another. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  This corridor, could it be used by the vehicle? 
A.	No, no, a vehicle would be unable to use those corridors. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  However, in the compound of the presbytery were there any spaces that could have been used by a vehicle? 
A.	There was a place which I could refer to as a garage and that is where the vehicles went when they came into that compound. 
Q.	Very well.  Witness BZ1 do you have any relationship whatsoever with Father Seromba? 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, I object to this question.  This is the essence of the sort of question I had objected about.  This is what we call in the common law, and counsel has decried the use of the common law, but my apologies, as a second bite of the cherry.  He had his opportunity.  Now it is not the time for these questions.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I believe you can move on to something else, if you still have questions for this witness. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, however, by your leave, I would like to respond to the question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may respond if you wish.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you.  Yes, this question which I am putting to the witness is a reaction to questions which were quite inappropriate and put to the witness by the Prosecutor, namely, that of trying to find out whether the witness was Hutu; and, secondly, the question as to whether he came here assists Father Seromba.  I believe, Madam President, that this kind of question is supposed to discredit the testimony of this witness.  And the Defence has the right under the circumstances to reconstitute the truth and the status of the person who is testifying.  This is why I thought it was necessary for us to respond to the objection raised.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, can you reformulate your question because the objection is sustained. 
MR. NEKUIE:
By all means, Madam President. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness BZ1, why did you come here to Arusha? 
A.	I came to Arusha in order to testify in this case and to say the truth about the events that took place in Nyange, especially at the parish.  Therefore, I needed to speak the truth about what happened so that the Tribunal might take its decisions to acquit the innocent and face up to its responsibilities.  I thought I was going to speak about this at the end of my testimony.

Now regarding the question which was put to me as to whether I was Hutu or not and whether I had come here to assist Seromba, this would presume that the Prosecution knows that Seromba is Hutu.  At any rate, I didn't come to help him because he is Hutu; I came here to testify as a Defence witness because I know he is innocent and that the Chamber must render justice.  And the truth is well known except that some people are trampling on the truth 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Do you know whether today in Rwanda there is a distinction still made between Hutu and Tutsi? 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor. 
MS. ALEXIS:
It is not that I am trying to be in any way obstructionist, but question after question, Counsel delves into matters that are not the fit meat of re-examination.  Whether in Rwanda now, there is a distinction between Hutu and Tutsi has nothing to do with this matter at hand, which happened in 1994.  For in any event, the issues that this Tribunal is dealing with have to do with 1994, and not today's date.  So what occurs today, in my view, is of no moment.  

So that I object because, one, it is not relevant; and two, it is not a proper question for re-examination.  There is no ambiguity about this; neither can counsel claim that it was a new issue which came up, that is whether people are still considered to be Hutus or Tutsis in Rwanda at this moment. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Nekuie.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Madam President, I can be blamed for not having put questions which have nothing to do with this trial, but I can also respond quite simply that it is because of this kind of question that I'm reacting.  If a witness is being asked whether he is Hutu, I'm wondering what this has to do with today's trial.  Better still, the matter of being Hutu or Tutsi is a problem of reconciliation which is part of the objectives of your Tribunal.  And this is why it was established, and to mention the matter of Tutsi or Hutu before you is not going out of the subject matter.

Your Honours, Madam President, I am not the only one who has mentioned the matter of ethnicity.  The Prosecutor clearly asked the witness whether he was Hutu.  I'm wondering whether this has anything to do with the facts that we are dealing with now.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, the majority is against you putting this question to the witness.  Do you have any other questions for this witness? 
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, I will have to comply by your ruling and I will proceed by asking one last question of Witness BZ1. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness BZ1, do you know the origin of the term Inyenzi, more specifically, from where did you hear for the first time the use of that term Inyenzi? 
A.	In the history of our country as I have learned my history lessons, from the year 1963 after Rwanda's independence the Tutsi who were in power fled the country and subsequently they launched attacks against the country; and at the time they were referring to themselves as Inyenzi.  During the initial attacks they referred to themselves as Inyenzi.  So it is not people who gave them that name.  They themselves were the ones who referred to themselves as Inyenzi. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ1, I want you to be rather more specific than you have been thus far.  I wanted to know from when you yourself heard for the first time the use of this term.  Was it during your history lessons and when specifically was it if you remember, obviously? 
A.	The second time that I heard this term was in 1990.  People who were attacking the country then were referred to as Inyenzi Inkotanyi -- referred to themselves, I beg your pardon, as Inyenzi Inkotanyi.  But I also stated that what the term Inyenzi is used in our Kinyarwanda language, one is referring to an insect which is well known.  I don't know how Tutsis came to giving themselves this name which has the same meaning as a well-known insect in the Rwanda language. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  So according to you, Inyenzi cannot be any abbreviation? 
A.	The meaning of the word Inyenzi, I don't know how to say it, but when you say Inyenzi it is a single word.  So there was a group of people who referred to themselves as Inyenzi.  It is as if someone decides to call himself an antelope.  Later on people would use that term in reference to the persons or people who supported the RPF, they were known as Inyenzi. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, Your Honours, this is the end of the re-examination of this witness by the Defence. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Very well, Witness BZ1, we thank you for kindly having come to testify before this Tribunal.  We have now come to the end of questions being put to you because you have thus far been examined-in-chief, cross-examined and re-examined by the Defence.  And we wish you a safe return home.  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
I have a request to make of the Chamber.  I have a request to make of you as an authority of this Tribunal.  I would like to inform you that Father Seromba is innocent, if you wish you can release him.  And before I go back home, I would like to ask permission to greet him. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, Mr. Monthé and Mr. Nekuie and those defending Father Seromba, will do the needful to ensure that you can see and speak with Father Seromba.  Yes, they do agree that they will do the same and this has been said in relation to other witnesses. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, quite so, Madam President.  And we have already taken steps in that regard. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you, Counsel.  The witness may leave the courtroom.  I believe we have another witness present. 
(Witness BZ1 excused)
(Witness YA1 entered the courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are Witness YA1.  
THE WITNESS:
Very well. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you feel better now?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
At any rate, we won't be very long today. 
THE WITNESS:
Madam President, I am still ill but I will try to move forward with my testimony. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, thank you for that, Witness.  You are now going to take a solemn declaration, after which the Defence will conduct an examination-in-chief of you.  And since we will rise at 6 o'clock this evening, today's proceedings will not be long and then we will proceed next week. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understand, Madam President, thank you. 	
(Declaration made by the Witness YA1 in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness, for taking the solemn declaration.  Now we give the floor to Mr. Nekuie, who will proceed with the examination-in-chief of this witness. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Madam President.  Before we begin, Madam President, with your leave, I would kindly ask the registry to distribute the identification sheet for this witness. 

Very well.  May I proceed, Madam President? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you. 
WITNESS YA1,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Good evening Witness YA1. 
A.	Good evening, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness YA1, before we begin, let me introduce myself.  I am Barnabé Nekuie, co-counsel for      Patrice Monthé representing Athanase Seromba on whose behalf you are testifying this afternoon.  Do you understand, Witness? 
A.	Yes, I understand, Counsel. 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness YA1, on behalf of the Defence, first let me thank you for your efforts in coming here to testify, I mean to Arusha.  And I also thank you for the efforts of being here this afternoon, given your health situation.  Now, Witness, I have handed you an identification sheet, which has also been distributed to the parties in this Honourable Chamber.  

Please look at that document and verify all of the information contained in it.  Kindly indicate to the Chamber that the information is true and correct and that the signature on the document is, indeed, yours.  Do you understand me, Witness? 
A.	I understand. 
Q.	Very well, is that your identification sheet, and is it, indeed, your signature?  Could you please confirm this for the Chamber? 
A.	Yes, that is my signature and this is my identification sheet. 
Q.	Thank you.
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, Your Honours, since the witness has just confirmed that this is his identification sheet, I would pray your Chamber to admit the sheet as the next Defence exhibit.  It should be marked -- could the registry kindly assist me in determining which exhibit number this will be?  

D. 54, and I would request, Madam President, that it be placed under seal.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objection, Mr. Prosecutor.  
MR. MOSES:
No. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The document is admitted as a Defence exhibit and shall be marked D. 54, and placed under seal.  You may proceed Counsel.  
(Exhibit No. D. 54 admitted, under seal) 
MR. NEKUIE:  
Thank you, Madam President 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness BZ1, I wish to put a series of questions to you.  For each question please give a specific and concise answer.  If ever the question seems unintelligible to you, please point that out for me and I will rephrase the question so that you understand it better.  Furthermore, let me point out that you are a protected witness.  If ever I put a question to you that may risk revealing your identity, kindly draw my attention to that point so that I stop that line of questioning.  Have you heard me and do you understand me, Witness? 
A.	Yes I understand, Counsel. 
Q.	Very well, Witness YA1.  Witness YA1, can you tell this Chamber, of course if you remember, where you were exactly in 1994.  Were you in Rwanda, and if so, where exactly? 
A.	Yes, I was in Rwanda.  I was in Rwanda. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness YA1? In which area of Rwanda were you in April 1994? 
A.	I was at Nyange parish.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Must I understand that you lived at Nyange parish, or are you saying that you were there in Nyange?  Could you be more specific, Witness, for the benefit of the Chamber? 
A.	It was in Nyange, I was often in the vicinity due to the job I had. 
(Pages 27 to 35 by Donna M. Lewis)




































1750H 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Thank you, Witness YA1.  What was your job, therefore, at that time.  Can you tell us? 
A.	Yes, I can explain that for you. 
Q.	Go ahead, Witness.  You are giving this information for the benefit of the Chamber.  
A.	At that time ***************************************.  I was a trader, a type of travelling salesman in that area. 
Q.	Thank you, YA1.  YA1, tell me, during that period, did you experience any extraordinary events, and if so, which events did you experience; specifically, we're referring to April 1994.  
A.	There was an abnormal event which occurred at that time.  In fact, President Habyarimana died. 
Q.	Do you know how that happened? 
A.	I don't know how he died.  I did hear people say that he was killed by Inyenzi, Inkotanyis. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness YA1.  Can you tell this Honourable Chamber, Witness YA1, if that news had any impact on the behaviour of people in your area and on your own personal behaviour.  
A.	People's behaviour changed after they heard the news of the president's death.  People began to flee. People were completely discouraged. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When exactly did you learn of the news? 
A.	Most people heard the news of Habyarimana's death on the 7th. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  What about you personally; did you also learn about it on the 7th, and if so, under which circumstances? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  On the 7th I heard that Habyarimana passed away.  That's how I learned of the news. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness YA1.  Do you remember the people who told you the news or did you learn of it some other way? 
A.	The news spread everywhere.  People were aware of it.  On that day of the 7th, people began to flee. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness YA1.  Can you specify for this Chamber, of course, if you remember, where you were exactly when you heard the news; were you at home, were you somewhere else? 
A.	I told you that I sold different things in Nyange parish very close*******************************************.  I walked around selling my goods and that's how I learned of the news. 
Q.	Thank you, YA1.  You said that people began to flee.  Who are you referring to specifically? 
A.	Tutsis began to flee.  They had gone to seek refuge at the church. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness YA1.  On the 7th, did you see the refugees going to the church for refuge? 
A.	Rather, what I said was that, on the 7th, people were seeking refuge at the communal office.  I didn't mention the church. 
Q.	Very well, Witness YA1.  Those who sought refuge at the communal office, do you know who they were? 
A.	I heard people say that they were Tutsis.  I didn't know or try to find out their names. 
Q.	Thank you, YA1.  Were you there when those people were greeted at the communal office on the 7th? 
A.	Frankly, I can't tell you how they were greeted when they got there.  I saw them there, but I can't tell you how they were welcomed or greeted. 
Q.	Thank you, YA1.  Were you able to find out whether or not the people who were going to the communal office were doing so voluntarily or were they going there after being told to do so? 
A.	I don't know whether they went voluntarily or not.  I don't know if they were told to go there.  I simply saw them at the communal office. 
Q.	Very well, YA1.  Did you spend much time near the communal office to find out, for example, what the condition of the refugees was at the communal office? 
A.	I told you that I went by that location because of my job, but I wasn't looking into the living conditions of those refugees. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness YA1.  You saw refugees on the 7th.  They were on their way to the communal office, and you've just described the circumstances.  Did you experience anything the next day?  Did you see anything specific happen with regard to those refugees on the next day, in other words, on the 8th? 
A.	I believe that, beginning on the 7th, 8th and 9th, the refugees continued to gather at the communal office. 
Q.	Thank you, YA1. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Your Honour.  I can see that we've reached the end of the work day.  I don't know if Your Honour or the Chamber intends to give us more time, but given our client's situation, perhaps this is a good time to stop what we've been doing for a few days. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we're going to adjourn for the time being.  The witness seems to be tired.  He should rest a bit.  We are not in a position to hold proceedings tomorrow, and so we will resume Monday in the afternoon at 2 p.m., at which time we will proceed with the testimony of this witness who I hope will be feeling better by that time. 

Witness, we are going to stop for today.  We hope that you will be feeling better on Monday. 
(Witness exited courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good evening to all.  Thank you.  We will resume Monday.  These proceedings are adjourned.
