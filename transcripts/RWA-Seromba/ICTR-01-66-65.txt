P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is in session.  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  We were experiencing a technical difficulty, but it seems all has been settled.

Good morning, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President.

Counsel Monthé will proceed with the re-examination which he started yesterday.  Could you please answer the questions put now a concise and brief manner?
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Your Honours, good morning.
ANASTHASE NKINAMUBANZI,
RE-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Nkinamubanzi, Anasthase, how are you?
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  I am well, and you may continue putting questions to me on those issues which were not clear to you.  I have no problem whatsoever.
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Nkinamubanzi, we shall start our re-examination this morning.  Mr. Witness, I would like to go over the Prosecution Exhibit, which was tendered into evidence yesterday, bearing No. P. 54.  It is a document, K0349858, which is the report -- is a report on -- dated 19th of April 1995, of the interview with Ferdinand Mbera (phonetic) who was an officer of the public prosecutor's office.  Do you remember such a document, Mr. Witness?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, regarding the said document, I believe I do remember it.  And I would like to know on which item counsel wishes to interrogate me.  I am willing to answer any clarifications on some points that might not be clear to you.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Before we start dealing with this document, do you believe you might have made a mistake as to the date when the Nyange church was destroyed?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, everybody knows on what date the church was destroyed.  I don't think I can make any mistake on the date.  I cannot say that it took place on the 10th or on the 20th.  The Nyange church was demolished on the 16th, as everybody knows.
Q.	I thank you.  Let me refer you back to this document, Mr. Witness, and, especially, to the question raised:  "Why are you imprisoned?", and the answer is, "I'm accused of having committed killing in the Kivumu commune on the 18th April 1994."  How can you explain such a response?
A.	This question can be answered quite easily.  Mbera accepted that I said that the date of the 18th was given for the demolition of the church, whereas he had proof that the church had been destroyed on the 16th.  Had it been the case, he would not have accepted that I sign this report.  I do not recognise this document in which I would have said that the church was destroyed on the 18th, and I invite you not to give any credence to this document because the church was destroyed on the 16th.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, in order for us to be able to use this document more easily with the witness, I have a Kinyarwanda version of the document which was tendered into evidence by the Prosecutor and, with your leave, I would like this document to be given to the witness so that the re-direct can run more the smoothly. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you are now in possession of the document in Kinyarwanda, which is your mother tongue, and I will ask you to peruse the document and tell me: once you reach the last page, whether you usually signed the documents -- judicial documents in your country using a fingerprint, as the fingerprint that appears on the last page of this document?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I have been requested to answer questions briefly.  I shall attempt to do so on a question which seems to be recurrent.  Yesterday, the Prosecutor used some documents, and a number of questions were raised on the signature, but the Prosecutor never put before me a document on which I would have put my fingerprint.  All the documents I drafted were signed by me, and I believe only the documents which I have signed should be taken into account.  With regard to the fingerprints, I do not recognise the fingerprints as being mine, and I must add that in 1995, the public prosecutor's office did not have a stamp.  I would like to tell Counsel that I do not recognise the said document on which I purportedly put my fingerprints because I never did such a thing.

I will also like to remind the Chamber that this letter was drafted on the 19th, if I'm not mistaken.  It was written on the 19th and it is on that date that I left the Kibuye prison at 11 p.m. and I was escorted by a battalion of soldiers.  I reached Gitarama around midnight.  The prison was opened and I was brought into the prison.  From my recollection, I do not recall having drafted any document on the 19th, and I was transferred during the night and my fellow detainees were quite concerned and thought that my end had come.  Madam President, this is briefly the answer I may provide to the question put to me on -- regarding this letter.
Q.	I have no further questions on this document.  Mr. Witness, I would like at this stage to broach a different subject.  You have stated that you met with the investigators of the Tribunal on several occasions of the Prosecutor's office -- rather, of this Tribunal on several occasions; is that correct?
A.	I'm not going to change or alter my statement whereby I met with the investigators of the Prosecutor's office on several occasions.
Q.	You met with them in the Gitarama prison, where you were, or outside Gitarama prison?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, when we meet with people coming from outside, especially with investigators, we are summoned by the Prosecutor.  And I would like to provide explanations in two stages.  In 1999, as I previously stated, we would be summoned by the Prosecutor who would inform us that the following day we would have interviews with a number of people, and the meetings would take place at public prosecutor's office.

When I arrived in Gitarama, at first, I would meet with them at the Gitarama public prosecutor's office.  The first time I met with the Prosecutor, we talked.  On the second occasion, I met with a Canadian lady.  I noted that she did not have a clear understanding of the facts.  And on other occasions, the prison authorities put at our disposal a room where we could meet with those who needed our assistance.  Only Defence counsel had problems meeting with the prisoners inside the prison.  I believe arrangements were made with Rwandan authorities.  I know that Defence counsel can meet with detainees, with the authorisation of the Prosecutor.
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you are to meet with Defence counsel in Gitarama, are you also summoned on the previous day by the public prosecutor, as he does when you are to be interviewed by ICTR investigators; does he put his office at your disposal?
A.	When the Defence counsel come to the prison to meet with the prisoners, we are not forewarned, and this is not the way they proceed when the Prosecutor comes to meet with the prisoners, so I will say that there is a different attitude adopted.
Q.	Mr. Witness, during the meetings you held with the investigators of the Prosecutor's office, did they at any point in time allude to the fact you were not telling the truth?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, towards the end of our meeting when we started having discussions, it was on the excerpt which said "demolish the church; we shall build another one".  And it is from then on, that my objective was to tell the truth on Nyange.  Nobody told me that I was not telling truth, but we had discussions on some parts of the document whereby I would have been told, "Destroy the church, we shall build another one.  There are many Christians".  So we were not able to agree on specific parts of the document.
Q.	Yes, Mr. Witness.  But, yesterday, the Prosecutor, during his cross-examination, said , and I quote him, that you are a liar and that it was the reason for which he had retrieved you from his list, that you had come out all the way to Arusha, and you had not been able to testify.  What do you answer to that?
A.	The Prosecutor took me off the list of Prosecutor's witnesses because he said I was a liar.  That is because we were not able to agree on specific parts of the statement.  He did not tell me he was striking me of the list.  He did it in a very diplomatic way.  He told me that I had to go back to Rwanda because I was not available, and I had another case -- or, rather, he had another case he had to deal with in Yugoslavia.  So I did not talk with the Prosecutor.  I simply told him that it was not my intention to tell lies by stating that Father Seromba had given me orders, and this is why we were not able to agree.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  It was also mentioned yesterday that you purportedly received money from any party in order come and testify before this Chamber.  Is that correct; did you receive any money to come and testify before this Court?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I believe there are people who are behind this plot.  When the Prosecutor put this question to me yesterday, that is to say that I would have received money in order testify in defence of Father Seromba, I must say that I was quite surprised.  Let me say that nobody gave me any money.

This is what happened.  When I met with one investigator at the Gitarama public prosecutor's office, and I believe you will understand me, I met with him at the prosecutor's office; I was ill.  And I would like to say that up till now I am not very well.  I suffer from gastritis and I also have pulmonary problems, and all this started when I was imprisoned.

On that occasion the Prosecutor paid money to the Gitarama social services.  He did not pay money to me.  I, therefore, did not know whether he was referring to the money he paid to the Gitarama social services.  I believe he is trying to manipulate me.  He paid the money to the social service (sic) in order to enable me to obtain medication.  For a certain period of time, prisoners were in charge of paying for their own health care.  For some time now, I have been receiving drugs.  I believe that was the time when some prisoners started spreading rumours that I had received money in order to come and give testimony here.  But it was, indeed, money that had been paid to the social service to enable me to obtain drugs, since I was ill.

When I heard that I had received money to come and give evidence here, I was very surprised.  I heard that some people said I had received money from Seromba's relatives.  Let me point out that I received no money from anybody, be it from Seromba's brothers or from the Prosecutor.  It has been said that Seromba's brother gave me money.  I was transferred to that prison recently, and I have not known him for a long time.  If someone came to ask me to help his brother and I refused, it is not my fault.  I have never received any money to come and give evidence for Seromba.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You have just given evidence lengthily in open session in this trial.  Do you have any fears whatsoever as you prepare to go home after giving your evidence here?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I would like to, first and foremost, thank you for allowing me to evidence openly, I Anasthase Nkinamubanzi.  When I came here, I came here to tell the truth on what happened in Rwanda.  That is why I have never said that I had any fears regarding my return to Rwanda.  I know that the Rwandan authorities would like the truth to be brought to light, and that is why Gacaca courts have been set up.  That is, by the way, what encouraged me to come here and tell the truth in public, because I would like everyone to know the truth.  Even those attending the Gacaca courts would also be informed, and I am, therefore, ready to appear before those courts.  I am ready to tell the truth about what happened in Nyange to help bring the truth to light.  Madam President, Your Honours, I would, therefore, like to point out to you that I not think my life is in danger.  I have no fears on this subject.  I reassure you that we are citizens of that country.  It is our country and we have to tell truth.  I feel safe.
Q.	Mr. Anasthase Nkinamubanzi, we have come to the end of your re-examination.  All I can say is many thanks to you.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I have no further questions for Witness Anasthase Nkinamubanzi, and he is now in your hands.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Monthé.

Witness, you have come to the end of your examination before this Court.  We thank you for coming to give evidence, and to answer all the questions that have been put to you.  As I have told you, here, we do not bring any pressure to bear on any witness appearing before this Court.  All you have said now is on record and we shall weigh the evidence you have given.  I wish you a safe journey back home and, in particular, good health.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  I would like to, once more, thank you.  When I came here to give evidence my aim was not to clear Father Seromba of the charges against him or support him.  I haven't come here to demolish the Prosecution's arguments; I simply came here to help bring the truth to light, and I'm doing so in the interests of justice.  I know I have taken an oath before this Chamber to tell the truth and nothing but the truth.  To conclude, therefore, I wish you God's blessing will continue to pray for you.  I thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  You may leave now.
(Witness excused)

Counsel Monthé, according to list we have, it is witness F13 (sic) who will appear now, isn't it?  Who will examine this witness in-chief?  Mr. Nekuie?
MR. MONTHÉ:
Unless you prefer Mr. Nekuie, Madam President, I will let him examine the witness, but it will be my humble self.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I thought it was Counsel Nekuie.  I didn't know you were taking turns.
MR. MONTHÉ:
I am ready to examine the witness.  Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now, we will bring in Witness FE13.
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are a Defence witness, and you are a protected witness.  Your pseudonym is FE13.
THE WITNESS:
Right, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Monthé will examine you in-chief, followed by the Prosecutor who will do the cross-examination.  The Judges may also put some questions to you for purposes of clarification.  We request you to answer the questions that will be put to you, clearly and concisely.  But before these questions are put to you, we would like you to make a solemn declaration.
(Declaration made by Witness FE13 in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.

Counsel Monthé, you may proceed with the examination-in-chief of this witness.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, with your leave, I would like to give the registrar FE13's personal particulars sheet.
WITNESS FE13,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, you have a sheet before you.  Could you please examine it carefully and tell us whether the information thereon is correct?
A.	Yes, I believe these are my personal particulars.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, Your Honours.  Now that the witness has confirmed his identity, I would request this the Chamber should admit this document as a Defence exhibit, and the number will be -- can the registrar assist me?
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Eighty-six.

MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, the registrar confirms it is D. 86 and it should be placed under seal.  I thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objection by the Prosecutor?
MR. TOWNSEND:
No.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  This document containing FE13's personal particulars is admitted as a Defence exhibit and the Exhibit number is D. 86, placed under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 86 admitted, under seal)
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, I would like to start my examination-in-chief of FE13 by putting some questions to him that could reveal his identity.  I would, therefore, request you to allow us to go into closed session to protect the identity of this witness, and after that, I'll then proceed to questioning of this witness in open session.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No objection from the Prosecutor?  We will go into closed session now for purposes of protecting the witness and in the interests of justice.

I am sorry the public has to leave the gallery.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Monthé, we are now in open session.  Please proceed. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
	Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness FE13, can you tell the Chamber what was the agenda of that security meeting of the 11th of April 1994? 
A.	When participants came to attend that meeting they thought they were going to open the tenders for the construction of the Nyange market, but when we got to the venue of the meeting and realising that the security situation in the commune was precarious, and since the bourgemestre decided that we will deal with that security problem in order to solve the problem of refugees who were already fleeing from their homes, and indeed some had actually come to attend Sunday mass, but had not been able to go back home, some of the workers of the commune had also fled from their homes and sought refuge in the commune office.  Some people had even sought refuge at the health centre.  In brief, the decision was therefore taken to deal with the security problem and to find solutions to it. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Before proceeding to put further questions to you, I would ask you to refrain from giving any names that could reveal your identity since we are now in open session.  My next question to you is as follows:  What practical decisions were taken with regard to that precarious security situation in the commune at that meeting? 
A.	Thank you.  During that meeting, it was decided that each conseiller would be in charge of security in his secteur, there were communal police officers who were deployed in each secteur.  One communal police officer from a given secteur had to be sent to that secteur to assist the responsable de secteur in providing for the safety of that secteur regarding the problem of persons who had fled from their homes. It was decided that those people would be assembled at a given location, and it was pointed out that they would assemble at the church because there was enough space there.  And that wasn't the first time people had to assemble there.  It was, therefore, with a view to providing for their safety.  The bourgemestre approached the préfet and asked him to assign soldiers to assist the communal authorities to provide for safety.  When he phoned, he got the person in charge of administrative and legal affairs, and he told the bourgemestre that there were no soldiers at the préfecture and that war was raging, and that all they could fetch him were gendarmes.  He gave one condition that the commune would have to send a vehicle to pick up those gendarmes and would also provide their needs.  I believe during that meeting it was decided that the refugees would be kept in the church and the parish priest had already said that there was some food available at the CARITAS warehouse and that the food would be distributed to the refugees.  That is why that decision was taken.  
Q.	Witness FE13, the préfet you are referring would that be father Seromba? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Witness FE13, did Father Seromba attend that meeting of the 11th of April 1994? 
A.	I thank you, while we were attending the meeting, I did not see Father Seromba.  He did not participate in it.  I remember that during the meeting the bourgemestre read a letter that the priest had written to him informing him that he would not attend the meeting.  However, he said that he would adhere to the decisions that would be taken because he was ready to cooperate with the authorities in order to solve the security problem in the commune.  
Q.	Witness FE13, when it was decided, during the security meeting, that Tutsi refugees would be assembled in Nyange parish, was Father Seromba's point sought? 
A.	No, he could not be consulted, because he did not attend that meeting.  Ordinarily, when a communal council takes any decision, no one can object to that decision.  So he could, therefore, not have objected to a meeting taken during a security meeting in the commune. 
Q.	Thank you.  During that meeting of 11th of April 1994, was any decision taken to kill Tutsis? 
A.	No, it was out of the question to take a decision to go and kill Tutsis.  As I have pointed out to you, some Tutsis attended that meeting and they stayed right up to the end of the meeting.  And it was at the end of that meeting that refugees were led to the church to provide for their safety.  They could, therefore, not have taken it upon themselves to take the decision to go and kill Tutsis whereas some Tutsis attended that meeting.  You, yourself, can see that that was not possible. 
Q.	Witness FE13, thank you for this clarification.  Witness FE13, I will now ask you this question, pursuant to this decision, did you assemble all Tutsis in the parish on the parish premises? 
A.	After that decision, that decision did not concern everyone, it wasn't everyone who was concerned.  It was the duty of the bourgemestre to do so.  He could move about and he had the resources to do so.  Furthermore, it had been specified that they would lead the refugees to the church when the gendarmes would be present in the commune.  I, for one, being at the commune office, I know that after the meeting, the gendarmes arrived in the evening.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Do you know whether the bourgmestre held meetings with other communal authorities regarding this problem of security in Nyange parish in the company of Father Seromba, did you hear about that?  
A.	Thank you.  Regarding any such meetings held in the parish, I was never aware of the holding of such meetings.  Meetings held at the parish were meant for discussing problems regarding education.  Those invited to attend such meetings were headmasters of schools, principals of secondary schools and headmasters of primary schools.  And those meetings only dealt with educational issues.  Other meetings were held at the commune office, because there was a multi purpose hall which was big enough to be used for that purpose.  There was also another hall belonging to I G A, I G A.  There was enough room in that hall for such meetings.  I, therefore, did not hear of any meetings held in the parish.  It is possible that there were meetings we were not invited to attend.  But whenever our colleagues attended such meetings, they informed us of them. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Let us now talk about the day of the 15th of April 1994.  Did you go to Nyange parish on that day?  
A.	No.  On the 15th of April, I did not go to Nyange parish church. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did you hear what happened there?  Did you obtain any information in that regard? 
A.	***************************************, you would understand that on each occasion, the first thing I did was to pass on information, particularly if something unusual had happened in the vicinity.  On that day I did not go to ********************.  I remained in my secteur, because there was a problem of some people who had been killed by wrongdoers.  Those people were killed in their homes and their bodies were abandoned on the site.  We had to go around and burry those bodies.  It was only on the 16th that I went to the commune office.  When I got there, I found a communal police officer, who told me that the day before, that is, on the 14th, a grenade had been thrown at certain refugees and they had died.  That was information I received on the 16th of April when I got to the commune office.  Those people were actually killed on the 15th of April. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Said the witness.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	So on the 16th of April you obtained information on what had happened the day before.  That is, on the 15th.  Did you go to Nyange parish on the 16th, in the morning? 
A.	When I got to the church, I realised that a grenade had been launched and there were about 40 bodies but I'm not sure.  I saw them piled up in a mass grave, I went to the church out of curiosity, actually on the 16th in the morning, I asked someone what had happened, and he told me that about 40 persons had been killed.  I spoke to that person to try to get further information, because I knew that even if I had been ***********************************************************************************, I had to obtain information in order to inform the others.
Q.	Thank you, Witness, when did you arrive at Nyange church on that 16th of April, what time was it?  
A.	I got there in the morning, at about 8 a.m.  I said so because ************************ at 8 a.m. and it took me about an hour to get to the business centre.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, I see that it is now 11 a.m., time for the break.  I would suggest that we adjourn for a few minutes and resume after the break.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Counsel we shall take a fifteen minutes break.  The Court is adjourned.  
(Court recessed from 1100H to 1115H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is called to order, Counsel Monthé, you have the floor for the remainder of the examination-in-chief of this witness. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.

BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you hear me? 
A.	Yes, I can hear you perfectly.  Thank you. 
Q.	When we adjourned a few moments ago I was talking with you of the day of the 16th of April 1994 in the Nyange parish, do you remember what we were discussing? 
A.	Yes, I do counsel. 
Q.	Thank you.  You told us that you arrived at the parish on the 16th of April, 1994 around 8:00 in the morning, is that correct?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	What did you see on the 16th of April at 8:00 in the morning in the parish, when you got there? 
A.	I told you that when I arrived at the communal office I was informed that the previous day a grenade had been launched against the refugees who were in the church, so I went there to see what had happened and I stopped at the level of the mass grave where dead bodies had been buried, otherwise, I did not reach the parish.  The mass grave was dug close to this, to the road leading to the church on the right-hand side behind the headquarters of CARITAS there was a mass grave in which the bodies had been piled up. 
Q.	Witness FE13, do you know that the Nyange church was destroyed on the 16th of April 1994? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you witness the destruction of the said church? 
A.	On the 16th when the grenade had just been launched against the refugees, they locked themselves in.  And on the 16th, a number of attacks were launched, the assailants attacked the church and on that day, the bourgemestre of the commune who was also present had provided ammunition.  Shots -- we shot at the refugees who were inside the church through the windows.  People would throw stones on the windows of the church and all the windows had been broken.  So, very briefly, I can say that I was present when the church was demolished. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, do you know one Anasthase Nkinamubanzi.  
A.	I do know Anastse Nkinamubanzi.  I met him when the Astalde company started constructing the Gitarama Kibuye road.  He was one of the drivers of the company.  I know him because the employees who were not from the commune *****************************************************************.  So I knew him as a resident of the commune and as an employee of the Astalde company. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE13.  On the 16th of April 1994, did you see Anasthase Nkinamubanzi  at the time when the Nyange church was being demolished? 
A.	Yes, I did see him.  He was there.  
Q.	He was there, what was he doing when you saw him? 
A.	On the 15th when the grenade had just been thrown on the refugees, it was necessary to see under what conditions the many dead bodies could be buried.  And those who were responsible for those acts used the equipment of Astalde in order to bury the dead bodies.  So the bodies were piled up in a mass grave and on the 16th, Nkinamubanzi was present and he was driving a bulldozer.  And it was the same bulldozer that was used to destroy the church. 
Q.	I thank you.  Witness FE13, were you present and did you speak to Nkinamubanzi before he destroyed the church.  Did you exchange words with him?  And if the answer is, "Yes", what did you tell him? 
A.	On that day, I arrived on the site late because I had gone to the Gasave secteur for other reasons.  I was to go to Nyange **************************************.  When I reached the communal office, there were no other employees there and when I asked the policeman what was happening, he informed me that the bourgemestre was at the church.  So, I headed towards the church and once I arrived there, I found the bourgemestre as well as a significant crowd of people.  I told you previously that when I got there, shots had been fired into the church, stones had also been thrown.  When I arrived I stood close to the commune CIO.  He asked me to ask Nkinamubanzi who was on the other side of the church to come over to where we were.  He was going towards the road that intersects with the main road at a place called Mugabano.  And he was going towards the church.  I signaled him for him to come to us, when he arrived, I did not hear what Kayishema told him because I was not close to them.  All I know is that thereafter Nkinamubanzi started destroying the church.  I was flabbergasted, and I fled from that location.  I believe that is all I can say for the moment. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE13.  You would, therefore, deduce that it was what Kayishema said that caused him to destroy the church.  You say that criminal investigations officer, Kayishema, spoke to him and thereafter he destroyed the church; isn't that what you said? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you want to say something Prosecutor? 
MR. TOWNSEND:
I would like to object for lack of notice.  None of this alleged conversation or evidence appears in the statement, Your Honours.  And secondly, the question calls for a conclusion you deduced.  He can testify as to his observation, his perception, but not to a conclusions.  But mostly, my objection is this appears nowhere in the statement, and these question seem to be prepared.  So, counsel is aware of this evidence, intended to lead it, but failed to disclose it.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Read this --- Madam President, I believe a few days ago you issued a decision on this issue to the effect that such objections should be avoided.  I am surprised by the position of the Prosecutor.  We have the same questions and the same objections.  Maybe the members of the Prosecution should consult with one another.  I have said, on several occasions, that I didn't come here with an encyclopedia and all questions ere not prepared in advance.  I would like to refer to 6th April which provides that all -- when the party has disclosed a statement, he can examine the witness on the basis of that statement, but he cannot expect the statement to be exhaustive.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber finds that, indeed, what has been said has not at all been disclosed to the Prosecutor.  However, we request Counsel Monthé to proceed and we will give more time to the Prosecutor to prepare his cross-examination, if he so wishes, but counsel should endeavour not to stray too far from the statement given by the witness. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, let us come back to the destruction of Nyange church.  While the church was being destroyed, which are the authorities you saw there? 
A.	Thank you.  Those present included the bourgemestre of the commune.  The president of the Canton court, Joseph Habyambere, the criminal investigations officer of the commune, Fulgence Kayishema.  Those were the authorities present on the scene.  Otherwise, there were other persons working in other services.  
Q.	Witness FE13, do you know how the church was destroyed? 
A.	I believe I have just answered this question.  I said that I arrived at the church and I met the authorities I have just named there.  There was a crowd of people, when I got there, I went up to the criminal investigations officer, of the commune in charge of communal security, and he asked me to call Anastse Nkinamubanzi, the driver of the bulldozer, he came and they spoke with one another, but I didn't hear what they said and after their conversation Nkinamubanzi immediately started destroying the church.  These are the only explanations I can give you for the time being. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, FE13, did you hear who had sent for the bulldozer to Nyange church on the 16th of April 1994?  
A.	I do not know who sent for that bulldozer, but all I can tell you is that on the 15th, the person who went to fetch those bulldozers was a person called ********************************************************** and (By order of the Court the words have been redacted and put under separate cover).  At the beginning of the war he was dismissed from his duties.  ***************************************.
	Agri veterinary that's the name of the school Agri veterinary school.  Situated very close to the road above the commune office in a place called Rugasari.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness answered in French. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, refrain from giving information that could divulge your identity.  I have already told you so.  Provide information particularly when you are referring to colleagues when you provide information regarding your colleagues, you should understand that it could reveal your identity.  So avoid giving such answers.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I would propose that this particular statement be placed under the seal.  Since it is likely to reveal the witness's identity.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objection from the prosecutor?  
MR. TOWNSEND:
When he says the statement is he talking about the word "my colleague" or the entire answer, whichever one suits me.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I believe it is only the portion in which he refers to his "colleague".  We, therefore, direct that this part be placed under seal.  Please, Counsel Monthé, proceed.

1245H 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR.MONTHÉ:  	
Q.	Witness SE13, how many bulldozers or caterpillars did you see on that day? 
A.	On that day I saw the bulldozer driven by Anastase Nkinamubanzi, but according to information I got later, on that day, there were two bulldozers, and the second bulldozer was used to make a mass grave in which the dead bodies were buried -- were going to be buried. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Apart from Anastase Nkinamubanzi, did you see any drivers? 
A.	Yes, there were other drivers.  As I have told you, ************************************************************.  I will give you the names I remember.  There was a man called Mutima, another called Maurice, and there was also Albert. 
Q.	And what were those drivers doing on that day? 
A.	My answer to this question is as follows.  On that day, I did not stay put at that location in order to be able to see what everyone did there.  But he drove that bulldozer.  We had observed for the past few days that there had been a letter regarding the transfer of François (sic) Kinamubanzi to a construction site.  That driver drove the bulldozer to the church. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Monthé, please proceed.  We are sorry for this short interruption.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Not at all, Madam President?  Thank you.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, on that day, 16th April 1994, did you see Father Athanase Seromba, while Nyange church -- was being destroyed? 
A.	On that day, I did see Father Seromba.  There was a large crowd and there were no particular reasons to go and see him where he resided.  I had gone there to see the bourgmestre and when I arrived at that place, I observed that the church -- they had just started demolishing the church, and shortly thereafter, I left the scene.  On that day I did not see Father Seromba. 
Q.	Witness SE13, you told us during your testimony this morning, that the bourgmestre had requisitioned gendarmes from the préfecture to bring them to Nyange; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, you are right.   
Q.	They were supposed to provide for the safety of the refugees at the parish; is that right? 
A.	Yes, that was why they were at the church. 
Q.	Did you see them on the 16th of April while the church was being demolished? 
A.	They were present and there were four of them. 
Q.	Were there also communal police offices present? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And what were the different officers doing? 
A.	The gendarmes were stationed at the entrance to the presbytery and the policemen were scattered here and there in the crowd of members of the population surrounding the church. 
Q.	Witness SE13, can you explain to the Chamber, the circumstances and the atmosphere in which the church was demolished?  You state that Nkinamubanzi was there, and that he was driving the bulldozer.  What happened thereafter?  Did you remain there to observe what happened? 
A.	Assailants had come from practically everywhere.  The doors to the church were locked, and the refugees inside had barricaded the entrance of the doors with benches, such that they could not be opened.  The people outside the church could not go inside to find -- or to get at the refugees.  That is why they were throwing stones at the window panes above the doors.  So, above the doors were window panes.  It is true they had difficulty throwing stones.  There was total chaos outside.  People were trying to get into the church, and they were waiting for people to come out so that they could kill them. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Do you think Anasthase Nkinamubanzi could have avoided the killings at Nyange church, you who are present, do you think he could have avoided destroying Nyange church? 
A.	Not only was Nkinamubanzi from our region, but even those of us who are from the same commune could stop people from doing what they had to do as of the 12th of April.  Apart from those who were inside the church -- those who had sought refuge in their homes had been killed.  People were bloodthirsty and just being before them posed a problem.  Those in charge of security were present and they participated in the activities that were unfolding there.  That is why I said that Kinamubanzi could not have disobeyed the orders to destroy the church. 
Q.	Witness SE13, can you be more precise?  When you say people were bloodthirsty, what do you mean?  Can you be more specific? 
A.	When insecurity threatened our commune, there were certain people who engaged in those activities.  When I say that people were bloodthirsty, I am referring to those who carried out killings.  Usually, there were hoodlums on the hills who heeded no advice.  When they started killing people, they didn't stop; they continued.  That is why I say that those hooligans had killed, those on the hills, and they knew that only the refugees in the church had not been killed. So they came to kill them.  They were present and no one could stop them from executing the orders they had received. 
Q.	Witness SE13, you were present on that day.  Do you think Father Seromba could have prevented the destruction of that church? 
A.	My answer would be the same.  I have told you that the person being in charge of security, like the bourgmestre, investigation officer played a major role in the destruction of that church.  No one could disobey their orders or object to their decisions. 
Q.	Witness SE13, what could have been done on the 16th of April 1994, to prevent the destruction of that church? 
A.	At least, as far as I am concerned, I believe nothing could have been done to prevent the destruction of that church. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, have you ever had an association known as African Rights? 
A.	I was informed of that association called African Rights while I was in prison.  On that occasion, I heard that it was an association in charge of protecting the interest of survivors.  That is the information I have regarding that association. 
Q.	Thank you.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I would like to use Prosecution Exhibit P. 5, which has been admitted into evidence since the beginning of this trial, Prosecution Exhibit P. 5.  I would appreciate if the registry could assist us.  

Madam President, I will conclude my examination-in-chief on this question dealing with this document.  We will, unfortunately, be obliged to put the questions to the witness in closed session, because this document contains a certain number of names.  It will be difficult for us to put these questions to the witness without mentioning these names.  I am sorry about that.  

I would like to refer you to page 9, of the document, Madam President.  I made photocopies of all parties involved, that is, the Chamber itself, the Prosecutor -- have already had the document, as well as our friends from the different booths.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Where are these copies, Counsel?  Are they coming?
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, I am waiting for the registry to come to me.  The excerpt is at the bottom of the page.  A part that has been highlighted.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have now all been given a copy, so you may proceed, Counsel. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I am obliged to read the name of the person concerned.  So, how do we proceed?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, no objections?
MR. TOWNSEND:  
No.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Very well.  We shall now sit in closed session for the protection of the witness and in the interest of justice.  Our apologies to members of the public. 
 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 28 to 38 ] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
