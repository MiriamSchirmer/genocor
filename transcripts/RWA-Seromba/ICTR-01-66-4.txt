MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session.  Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. 

Mr. Pognon, we received a letter from Mr. Seromba, and we would like to give you the floor to enlighten the Chamber on what is at hand.
MR. POGNON:
Thank you, Madam President.  

Yesterday, when we contacted you in respect of this matter, we had already talked about the willingness of our client to be part of this trial action that the detainees in the detention facility undertook.  You wanted us to hold this pre-trial conference which, to a certain extent, does not hinder the execution of our duties -- that is, in not being present -- and that is why we attended the pre-trial conference.  

Now, I believe that our situation is clear, if we go by the letter of our client, being counsel that are working under oath and who cannot interfere with the proceedings of the Chamber.  As we promised yesterday to the Tribunal, we went and saw our client in order to discuss and report to the Chamber.  I think this morning you received his letter concerning the situation.  He has instructed us not to represent him as long as this strike action persists.  And that is all we can say today.  And thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Maître Pognon.  

Yes, Madam Prosecutor, you may take the floor.
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, Your Honours, I simply wish to make some comments on the terms of the issue.  

First of all, as concerns the trial in the absence of the Accused, I think there is a provision for a situation where the proceedings can go on in the absence of the Accused, and this is under 
Rule 82 bis.  And following what was said yesterday by the counsel of the client -- of the Accused, and taking into account the letter that he has sent to the Chamber, I am -- I'm taking into consideration other circumstances.  I would like the Chamber to confirm what was already established yesterday, that it is in the interest of justice for the trial to continue in the absence of the Accused.  

The second thing I would like to raise concerning the representation of the client, I would like to recall the professional code of ethics where it is clearly stated that the representation of the Accused is a public service in the interest of justice and that the Accused who does not have such services cannot decide how and to what extent he has to be represented.  The Prosecution feels that there is an ethical duty, an ethical rule, which compels the counsel for the Accused to represent him up until when the -- or to the extent that their terms of reference exist.  Accordingly, the representation is not within the province of the Accused to determine.  

The counsel should also take into consideration the terms -- his terms of reference independently of the instructions that he received from the Accused, and this is clearly stated in Article 4 of the professional code of ethics.  

As concerns the relationship between the Accused and his counsel, there are respects that are incompatible with the duty to serve in the interest of justice.  The counsel should decide independently to what extent he can represent his client and to what extent he can follow the instructions or discussions accruing -- or instructions accruing from discussions with his client.  So there is no reason for the proceedings to be suspended; rather, there are reasons working in favour of a continuation of the trial.  It is not up to the -- it doesn't fall within the brief of the Accused to interrupt this public service.  Witnesses have come to Arusha to testify and we cannot leave it up to the Accused to take the decision to interrupt the trial.  

So, Your Honours, I would like to request that we -- that you determine that we continue with the trial.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber -- following refusal of Athanase Seromba to appear in Court, Article 82 of the Rules of Procedure states that, "If an accused refuses to appear before the Trial Chamber for trial, the Chamber may order that the trial proceed in the absence of the accused for so long as his refusal persists, provided that the Trial Chamber is satisfied that, (i), the accused has made his initial appearance under Rule 62;(ii), the Registrar has duly notified the accused that he is required to be present for trial; and, (iii), the interest of the accused are represented by counsel."

The Chamber is satisfied that the conditions required for the continuation of trial in the absence of the Accused have been fulfilled in the present case; that is, that the initial appearance of the Accused, Athanase Seromba, before this Chamber was conducted as per the Rules.  In addition, he was duly notified by the registry that his presence is required for trial. 

And, lastly, the interests of the Accused are validly represented by counsel in the person of 
Counsel Pognon and co-counsel in the person of Maître Monthe.  Consequently, therefore, the Chamber orders the continuation of the trial in the absence of the Accused, Athanase Seromba, so long as he continues to persist in his refusal to be present in the Chamber for his trial.  

On the decision of the counsel not to participate in the proceedings upon the instructions of their client, the Chamber refers to its vested -- to its inherent powers to make any order -- to take any order necessary for the conduct of proceedings as per the provisions of Rule 54 as follows:  "At the request of either party or proprio motu, a Judge or a Trial Chamber may issue such orders, summonses, subpoenas, warrants and transfer orders as may be necessary for the purposes of an investigation for the preparation or conduct of the trial."  

In the case in point, the counsel representing the Accused have reported to the Chamber on the instructions they received from their client asking them not to represent him for the duration of the three-day strike.  The Chamber relies under -- relies on Article 4(1) of the code of ethics for Defence counsel which states as follows: "Counsel must advise and represent their clients until the client duly terminate counsel's position or counsel is otherwise withdrawn with the consent of the Tribunal."  

The Chamber considers that the instructions given by the Accused cannot be considered as having terminated the remit of counsel representing him.  Counsel for the Accused, having given instructions not to represent him for three days only, the Accused did not seek to end the power of attorney of his counsel.  Consequently, the Chamber notes that the power of attorney of his counsel has not been terminated and calls on them to represent them in the interest of justice during the trial.  

For these reasons, therefore, the Chamber orders the continuation of the trial in the absence of the Accused, Athanase Seromba, so long as he persists in his refusal to appear before the Chamber for his trial; orders Maître Pognon, the led counsel -- lead counsel for his client, for the Accused, Athanase Seromba, to continue to represent the Accused at his trial in the interest of justice.  The Court orders Counsel Pognon and Co-counsel Monthe.  We like to thank you.  

This, therefore, is the decision of the Chamber.  If there is no problem, I think we can call on the Prosecutor to call in the first witness.  And do I remember well that you told me that the first witness is an investigator?  

Yes, Maître Pognon.
MR. POGNON: 
We have listened keenly to the decision that has been rendered by the Chamber at the request of the Prosecutor, and which is consistent with the reasons adduced by the Prosecutor.  We are of the opinion that the duty to represent client assigned to us depends on the acceptance of the Accused.  

My colleague and myself - and I am sorry to say this -- we -- we accumulate about some 50 years of practice in this job and consistent with the rule in our rules of ethics, and which we have taught to other lawyers, and of whom we are custodians,  gives the lie to the fact that, in whatever manner possible, we represent a person who has not given us instructions to do so, and we would be failing in our duty; that is -- and we would be violating our code of ethics.  And the ruling that has just been made by the Chamber is making of us to work by force.  And I think here -- and this is a personal opinion and I would like to voice it -- it is -- it seems to us that it undermines our professional dignity and we would like to pray the Tribunal to grant us leave to withdraw because we cannot, in all decency, accept to find ourselves in a situation where we would be working in the interest of justice for an Accused who has instructed us not to do so, under the circumstances in which he asked us not to represent him.  That is what I was seeking to say, Madam President, and I would like to thank you for listening to me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, we have heard you, Maitre Pognon.

Do you want to take the floor, Madam Prosecutor?

The floor is yours.
MS. ARBIA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I do not know -- I don't know what -- how he wants to interpret your decision.  I don't know if he wants to appeal against your decision.  In any case, your decision is there and we wish to call our first witness and the examination-in-chief is going to be led by my colleague, Gregory Townsend.   Thank you.
(Defence counsel left the Chamber)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We realised that the counsel are withdrawing, whereas the Chamber hasn't said a word after the statement that was made by the Prosecutor.  Accordingly, we are going to take another decision forthwith in respect of the matter.  The Chamber stand adjourned for a few minutes.
(Court recessed from 1440H to 1521H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are resumed.  

The Trial Chamber, noting the disrespectful and discourteous attitude of the lawyers for the Accused who left the courtroom when the Court was still sitting, decides to give -- issue a warning to 
Counsel Pognon and Counsel Monthe, under the terms of Rule 46 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, and orders the registry to appoint counsel to represent the interest of the Accused pursuant to Rule 45: Quarter.
The proceedings will resume tomorrow at 2 p.m.  We are compelled to adjourn since the Accused is not represented at this time.  Court stands adjourned.
(Court adjourned at 1524H)
