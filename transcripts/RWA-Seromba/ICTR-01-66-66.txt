MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  We note that counsel for 
Father Seromba is absent, but Father Seromba is present.  We did say here, in this Court, that we'll be sitting this afternoon upon our return from Kigali, where we had to carry out an inspection in citu in connection with the Seromba trial.  It is now 3:30 (sic).  We landed at about 2 o'clock. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, we got here 3:30. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We felt that at about 4 o'clock all the parties will be here.  The only parties missing are the counsel for the Defence who were properly informed.  The co-coordinator or of this Chamber was asked to call on them and ask them what was wrong.  Counsel Monthé replied that he was tired.  And he also said that Counsel Nekuie was not feeling well.  So we find ourselves in circumstances whereby we won't be able to proceed with this trial in view of the fact that the Accused person is not being assisted by counsel.  

Be that as it may, we shall seek explanations as to why counsel is not present here today.  And we would like to ask the Prosecutor, in the event he intends to say anything.  Otherwise, we are sorry and we would be bound to adjourn. 
MR. TOWNSEND: 
I thank the Trial Chamber.  I just note for the record, the Accused is present in Court and not represented and counsel had been warned previously.  So, if excuses are inadequate we might be asking for sanctions.  In the absent of such a finding, I have nothing further to say for the record.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, did you want to say something, the Accused?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And he needs a microphone.  
THE ACCUSED:
Thank you, Madam President.  I merely wanted to ask you what happened to my counsel, because you travelled together.  I can see the Prosecutor, but I can't see them.  That's all I wanted to say.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, they did come back with us.  We can assure you, we were all together at the airport on our way back from Kigali, as I had stated earlier.  

Yes, Prosecutor. 

MR. TOWNSEND: 
To answer the quest of the Accused and so that the record is full and complete, at 2:30, it's my understanding that the Trial Chamber instructed all the parties to be present and ready at 4 p.m. today.  So, as at 2:30 after that agreement, we are not sure where counsel and co-counsel for the Accused have gone. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We wish to inform the Accused that all the parties were at Kigali, and we did say here in this courtroom that we would be resuming trial at 3:30.  But after checking our time, we felt that we would take a bit more time and therefore sit at 4 o'clock.  All the parties were aware that trial had to hold, or resume here at 4 o'clock.  They have not come.  They have decided not to be present and Trial Chamber prefers not to apply any sanctions here and now, for now, and they wish to seek explanations from counsel and subsequently Chamber shall act accordingly.
THE ACCUSED:
Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, then, we thank you all.  Clearly we deplore the fact that this is what has arisen.  Everybody was present.  And we had wanted to hold this session today and we are unable to hold this session because the Defence is not in attendance; in other words, counsel for the Accused, Seromba, who, himself is here in Court, his counsel is not there.  

Prosecutor, did you want to address the Court?  You may proceed. 
MR. TOWNSEND: 
Just for completeness of the record, Your Honours, I just would like the record to reflect that 
Witness FE is present in the box.  This is Defence witness, and everyone else is ready.   

And, finally, if I could ask the Court just to give the standard admonition to the witness not to discuss his testimony, having started his testimony until we resume what I presumes would be 9 o'clock on Wednesday morning, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, as we had told you, in principle today, Prosecutor had to proceed with the cross-examination.  This cannot be done because counsel for the Defence is not in attendance.  Obviously, you are still bound by your oath and you, therefore, should not engage in any communication with whomsoever, that is, with respect to the proceedings here or what is discussed here.  You understand you are not to engage in any communication in connection with what is discussed here.  

Very well, then, I suppose all we are left with now is to adjourn, and the Court stands adjourned.
(Court adjourned at 1625H)
