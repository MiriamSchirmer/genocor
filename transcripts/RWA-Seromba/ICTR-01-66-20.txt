MADAM PRESIDENT:
The court is in session.  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  

Counsel Pognon, this morning you're proceeding with the cross-examination of Witness CBN, and absent any problem, we may begin the proceedings.
MR. POGNON:
Thank you.  And good morning, Madam President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  

Good morning, Mr. CBN.  

Good morning, Counsel.

CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	During the proceedings of last Friday, we ended with the matter of your presence in front of the church.  When the Accused was there, was passing by there, and when various requests were made to him, first of all, the request for him to say mass since he was a reverend father?  You said, you stated that it was the delegation of people, that is, for instance, the teacher who saw him and made the request.  Do you confirm that that request was made to the father by the delegation of persons that you mentioned? 
A.	He was in front of us.  But the people who approached him approached him as his customary collaborators, but it was the will of all who was there.  We needed to hear mass, and we wanted mass to be said for us. 
Q.	In passing, you said those people who usually worked with him.  How were they the customary or usual collaborators? 
A.	They knew each other because the teachers normally -- often visit the priests.  In any case, the degree of familiarity could not be the same as mine.  We knew that the people who could approach him could agree.  All those who were there wished mass to be said for them or for us.
Q.	Well, are you saying that they were collaborators because they were teachers?  Is that your inference?  Or you knew that they were his effective collaborators; that is, they effectively collaborated with him?
A.	I realise that those teachers were well acquainted with him because people who are well-to-do usually know each other.  That was what I noted at the scene.
Q.	You realised that at the scene.  Does this imply that he talked to them in a familiar manner?  And having seen that, you inferred that they knew each other?
A.	Do you want it to the contrary?  Do you mean they did not know each other?  Please make things clearer.  Ask me if those people we're talking about knew each other or not.  Probably that is what should be clarified to begin with.
Q.	Good.  How do you know that the people that he mentions Rutegesha, Aloys, who represented the delegation that met the reverend father on behalf of all of you, how do you know, therefore, that those people who are teachers and other things?  The intellectuals?  How or what made you say that you realised that they knew each other? 
A.	I'm relying on the fact that those people approached him and that he himself acted likewise.
Q.	Thank you.  If there's a request to be made to the Father, who is in his parish, the person making the request, either those people or some other person, can they do anything other than to approach him? 
A.	What are you asking me really?  Do you want to ask me if -- if he approached him or greeted him by shaking his hands or what?  I don't quite understand your question. 
Q.	In stating that the person and the priest knew each other because -- that the people and the priest knew each other because they were lecturers or teachers, isn't that a deduction that you are making rather than a fact that you are establishing? 
A.	They knew each other.  Those people did not live far from the parish, and they and the priest knew each other. 
Q.	Thank you.  There's another question that we're going to dispose of very quickly.  You stated that you were in the banana plantation and that the priest came with the gendarmes and that in front of the priest, the gendarme allegedly told you that the priest was forbidding you from harvesting bananas, barring which he -- he was giving orders to shoot.  Do you confirm that statement? 
A.	Don't change things.  I answered that question, and I would request that you don't go backwards.  Let's instead make progress.  I think I answered that question when the Prosecutor asked the question to me, otherwise, if you want to repeat the question, do so, but let us not try to reverse things.  Let's not try to distort people's statements.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I think it is advisable that early on Monday morning we should try to cooperate in order to ascertain the truth.  And it so happens that I'm the one who's asking questions.  It also so happens that the Prosecutor asked you questions and that the Prosecutor and we are in different capacities and that the -- even if the Prosecutor asked you a question, I should be able to ask you for clarification, so please answer the question. 

At what point did this issue of the refusal for the people to have these bananas done, which came with the gendarmes being given authorisation to shoot in the event that you have a set of bananas?
A.	Well, in order to satisfy you, probably I should talk about this again.  This was on the 14th that we had asked the priest to say mass for us once again, and he refused once again and stopped us from going into the banana plantation.  And then he talked to the gendarmes and said the following:  "If there are refugees who go back to the banana plantation, you should shoot them, because apart from other things, you are also there to protect our banana plantation." 
Q.	Well, you see, we are making progress.  There was some specific fact in your statement of 27 August 2000.  You stated that the gendarme talked to you in the presence of Father Seromba.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Pognon, can you give us the page number, please.
MR. POGNON:
Yes, Madam President.  It's page 0152112, further down after the middle of the page, and I read -- if you are on that page already, Madam President?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we are.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	"One of the gendarmes, in the presence of Father Seromba, talked to us telling us that the priest had denied that we go and have us the bananas and that he had asked them to harvest the bananas to open fire on the Inyenzis who come to harvest the bananas."  I hope the interpreters translated those words that you said for you.  

So my question is as follows:  Is it the Accused himself who talked to you directly and forbade you from harvesting the bananas by threatening you, or is it the gendarme who told you you were forbidden to harvest the bananas and that it's the Accused who had issued such a ban? 
A.	I told you of what the Accused said.  After that the gendarme repeated the same statement and said, "You have heard what Father Seromba has said, that not go into other people's banana plantation anymore."
Q.	So it is the Accused himself who said this to you?  The statement I repeated to you, is it the Accused himself who said the words to you?
A.	Why do you want me to repeat this?  I told you what Seromba said.  And after he had made the statement, the gendarme came and repeated the same thing and said, "You have heard the ban issued by the Reverend Father, so don't go back into that banana plantation."
Q.	So if I were to remember your sentence here -- and I'm going to read it out again -- "on the next day, on Thursday" -- and it's the same sentence but it beings earlier -- "we once again requested from the priest to say mass for us, where a short while after, while we were harvesting, Father Seromba came accompanied by gendarmes.  One of the gendarmes, in the presence of Father Seromba" -- and I would like the interpreters to translate this faithfully -- "one of the gendarmes, in the presence of the Father Seromba, talked to us, informing us that the priest was forbidding us from harvesting bananas and that he had asked them to open fire on the Inyenzis who would be coming to harvest the bananas."  

Your present version is as follows.  If that's the case, you say yes, so I shall continue.  What you are saying now is the following:  The priests forbade you from harvesting bananas, barring which he had given orders to the gendarmes to shoot you.  After that the gendarme told you, "Have you heard what the priest has asked you?"  Is that it? 
A.	Yes.  This is what I have told you.  I related to you the statements made by Seromba, and I gave you the circumstances under which individuals made statements. 
Q.	Was it in the banana plantation that the statement was made? 
A.	We were in front of the church.
Q.	You were in front of the church.  If you were in front of the church, why would the reverend father make that statement to you while you were in front of the church instead of in the banana plantation? 
A.	We understand Kinyarwanda.  When you talk of a banana plantation, we know what you are referring to.  It is not necessary to talk about a banana plantation while you are there to know that you are in a banana plantation.  We knew what the matter where the banana plantation was, and we knew what he was referring to. 
Q.	So is it the banana plantation that is at Rugabano?  Well, so do you know the banana plantation?
A.	Yes, indeed.  It is the Rugabano banana plantation that was in question.
Q.	Thank you.  What made you tell the reverend father, even though you were only in the front of the church and your main concern was the mass he refused to say for you, that automatically he added that he was forbidding you from going to the banana plantation?  Is it because you were holding bananas in your hands?  Had you already harvested the bananas? 
A.	We had started harvesting the bananas. 
Q.	You had started harvesting the bananas. So while you were in front of the church, you had bananas that he saw with you; is that it?
A.	He had been informed that some of the refugees had started harvesting the bananas because of the hunger that was killing them.
Q.	Who had informed him?  Why don't you ask him a question?  You said he was informed.  Who informed him? 
A.	Well, when somebody prevents you from going to the banana plantation and he had noticed that we were hungry and that some bananas had been harvested.  I don't know.  Are you doing this deliberately, Counsel?  Do you think that he had given some other food instead of the bananas? 
Q.	Once again, isn't that something that is not untrue, because you stated that because you heard other people say so? 
A.	Well, I didn't hear that from anybody.  When he stopped us from harvesting the bananas, he knew why.  But please don't ask me for the reasons for his having forbidden us.  Probably he had been informed that we were harvesting or that we were getting ready to harvest bananas.
Q.	One last question regarding the bananas.  Do you think that Father Seromba can give orders to the gendarmes to open fire on people merely because they were harvesting bananas? 
A.	Well, that is what he said, but the gendarmes did not open fire on anyone. 
Q.	Thank you.  Concerning that morning, were there other requests that were put to Father Seromba and that he refused to oblige the people? 
A.	Which day referring to?  What date referring to, Counsel?
Q.	Well, people had talked to the reverend father.  He had refused to say mass for you.  He didn't allow you to have his bananas, and he didn't want to show the children where they could relieve themselves.  Were other requests made to the priest? 
A.	Are you talking about events that concerned the date of the 14th?  Why don't you be specific, counsel?
Q.	No.  Let's not talk about the 14th.  Did you ask for other things from the priest?
A.	We asked him to say mass for us.  One other thing was for him to show us where children could go and relieve themselves, and he said they could relieve themselves wherever they wanted, including near the altar.  I don't think there were any other requests.
Q.	Thank you.  You stated that on that Thursday you were in the front churchyard and that you had even been able to have some bananas.  In taking refuge in the church, did you used to open (sic) the doors of the church at night and in the morning you opened the doors, or did the church remain closed all the time?
A.	The church was open.  You do not lock up the church. 
Q.	Thank you.  That morning, can you confirm the position of the assailants that morning?  You were in front of the church.  Other people were inside the church, and where were the assailants? 
A.	They were around the church. 
Q.	This means that they were in front, a bit in front of you, and also on the side of the Kibuye road; is that it? 
A.	I don't know how we can explain this to you without the geographical map of the location.  They were assailants on the Nyunge hill, and you couldn't see them.  There were attacks from the direction of the market.  There were attacks that were coming from the Nyerumajeri direction.  There was another attack that came from the rear courtyard of the presbytery.  But I've talked about the surroundings of the church, but the attacks came from all over. 
Q.	You're saying that those in the rear courtyard were going towards the Rugabano, towards the banana plantation.  You said they were in the street.  I'm sure they were downwards toward the centre; is that correct? 
A.	No.  Let us set the rear courtyard aside.  Rather, it is near a wood that was further below where there were farms.  It was not in the rear courtyard.  Nobody went to the rear courtyard.
Q.	Is it the wood after the rear courtyard of the presbytery?
A.	There was even a road that branches off toward the cemetery, and it leads toward the cemetery.  It went past a few banana plantations that were there and reached the back of the storey building.
Q.	Be careful.  Be careful.  In reference to banana plantations, these are not the priests' banana plantations, I think. 
A.	They belonged to the priests. 
Q.	It is not in this banana plantation that you were, is it?
A.	No.  These are just a few banana trees which are a bit closer.
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  Let us turn now to your story regarding the presence of weapons.  You said last Friday, in response to a question put to you by the Prosecutor, which was as follows:  "Did you have weapons inside the church?"  And you answered yes.  Do you confirm this version of the facts? 
A.	The weapons referred to were there on Wednesday.  That is when they came to take them, that they confiscated them.
Q.	I believe you arrived on Tuesday.  Based on what you say, what you have had said so far, you arrived at 1:00 in the morning.  You said that you were unable to see anything.  Is it on that Wednesday morning when you woke up that you realised that there were weapons in the church with the refugees? 
A.	Our weapons were confiscated on Wednesday at about 4 p.m.  That is when they came to get them.
Q.	Wait.  Wait.  Wait, please.  Let's take it in stages.  Before the weapons can be confiscated, they must be there.  My question is as follows:  Tuesday night you arrived at 1 a.m. and you saw nothing, you say.  On Wednesday when you woke up, are you saying that in the church you saw, when you recognised a few people, that the people who had sought refuge in the church had weapons, were carrying weapons; is that what you're saying?  You answered yes or no.
A.	I saw the weapons the next day, but at night, when I arrived, I could see nothing. 
Q.	That's right.  That's what I said.  So you saw the weapons.  What sort of weapons were they?
A.	They were traditional weapons. 
Q.	What are you referring to as traditional weapons? 
A.	What I mean is machetes, sticks, and many other things like spears.  Actually, these are the traditional weapons with which we are familiar. 
Q.	Apart -- apart from spears, machetes, and sticks, are there any other weapons? 
A.	Are these things weapons?  Yes, they are weapons.  But if you are fighting with a stick, you can kill someone with it, so what can be used to kill can be considered as a weapon.  It is a weapon.
Q.	Does the habitual use of a stick, say, and a machete, are these things used to kill habitually? 
A.	Normally, a stick is used to herd cows.  A machete can be used for clearing a place or to cut wood.  But during the war, you can defend yourself with a machete or with a stick, and it is to this end that they obtained these weapons.  They wished to defend themselves with them.
Q.	Thank you for the explanation.  So this is the circumstantial use that's the refugees wished to make of these agricultural tools, and it is this use that caused these things to become weapons; is that it?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Thank you.  And you, when you came there, what weapon did you bring? 
A.	When I came, I was armed with a machete.
Q.	Well, thank you.  And is it you yourself who gave it up?  How were the weapons guarded?  How did it happen?  Did the gendarmes and the policemen come and stand somewhere in front of you and then each person would come and give in his weapon?  Describe how this gathering of weapons happened. 
A.	They came and they told us -- we had gathered in the church, and we thought that a meeting was going to be held to be -- to protect us, so they said, "All these instruments inside the church should be given to these people."  They reassured us by telling us that we were under protection, and we gave them all these tools. 
Q.	That is the introduction.  This is what they told you, but I would like to know whether everybody walked up and gave up his weapon in person or whether the policemen went to each of the people and took these weapons. 
A.	Everyone gave up his weapon, but in the meantime other policemen and gendarmes would go amongst the refugees and pick up some of the weapons.
Q.	Very well.  How many of them were there or thereabouts, that is, the gendarmes? 
A.	I think I saw two. 
Q.	And how many policemen were there for this weapon-gathering session? 
A.	I cannot tell the exact number, but I will give you the names.  You know you can even look where to see I listed the names and then you may perhaps do the arithmetic yourself. 
Q.	Tell us how many policemen there were. 
A.	I think that there were five in number. 
Q.	You said that on that Wednesday there were many of you, there were about a thousand refugees in the church; is that not correct? 
A.	What number did you say, Counsel?  How many -- how many were we?  Please repeat your question.
Q.	I am asking you:  How many of you were in the church?  I don't want to say anything that you did not mention.  That Wednesday, how many of you were in the church, a rough figure? 
A.	No.  I do (sic) not count the people because when you give an approximate figure, it is by no means exact, so I do not wish to give any figure at this time. 
Q.	Do you recall saying that, on that Wednesday, since people began to come you reached a thousand? 
A.	Of course.  This is an estimate.  Do you think that I started counting the refugees?  Of course, the refugees continued to come in with time -- as time went on, but if you ask me to give a figure, I don't know.  If you go to the market square on a market day, how can you count the people who are there?  It's just an estimate. 
Q.	If we are to stick with the estimate of 1,000 or perhaps a little less, we might consider that we are near to the actual number.  If we were to say 1,000, would that be correct? 
A.	Really, Counsel, please don't insist.  I'd like to ask the Court that we should not be so focused on figures, because I might even tell you that there were between 1,500 to 1,800 people.  That is an estimate, and I have told you that not many refugees arrived on Thursday.  In fact, I would say that no other people arrived.  I said that on Thursday I could have estimated the number of refugees present there at 2,000; so to cause me to advance figures, whereas I did not carry out the census, I really don't know what you're driving at. 
Q.	Let's stay with your estimate of 1,000.  How long did it take the policemen to gather the weapons, the weapons of the refugees in the church? 
A.	I was not carrying a watch, wearing a watch.  When they came and asked us to give us these weapons, we gave them up and the gendarmes went away.  They did not stay long at this place.  When you ask me the number of minutes that went by when they were there, I cannot give you any figure whatsoever.  They came and did what they had come for and they went away.
Q.	How did the gendarmes come there?
A.	Actually, you are talking of gendarmes, but in my case, I think that it was soldiers.  Others talked about gendarmes.
Q.	Well, in my view, gendarmes and soldiers are one and the same thing.  Well, let's stay with this theory.  Were they there before or they had arrived or they had come just for that, that is, to get the weapons or help the policemen to get the weapons? 
A.	In the morning when I arrived on the scene, they were at the roadblock which leads to the church.
Q.	How did they arrive at the church? 
A.	No.  I'm telling you that they were in front of the church where the roadblock was located.
Q.	Yes.  You have just said that to gather the weapons, they were five policemen and that two gendarmes came in the meantime to join them for this gathering of weapons.  So I asked you, that is, the gendarmes and the policemen, how did they reach the church to carry out this business of disarming the refugees? 
A.	You insist on talking about gendarmes.  Whether they're gendarmes or soldiers is not known to me.  The fact is that they were wearing military uniform.  I identified the policemen from their uniform.  They came to the church, and they said, "Get into the church."  We thought that it was a meeting, and we realised that this meeting actually consisted in depriving us of our weapons.  This is what I think I told you.
Q.	Yes.  But please answer the questions that are put to you.  I am asking you how they arrived there.  Did they come in a car?  Did they come on foot?  Did they come on a motorcycle?  How did they get there? 
A.	Now, are you talking about policemen or gendarmes, because you've talked about gendarmes or soldiers, which are one and the same thing to me?  I told you that I saw the soldiers there.  I found the soldiers there.  The policemen came on foot.  They came up from the centre, from the statue, and they came on foot.
Q.	Witness, I am asking you.  You should have answered -- you should have answered this a while ago, a long time ago.  Just don't resist the questions.  Just answer calmly. 
A.	Thank you.  Actually, if you say I am resisting the questions, I'm not resisting.  It's just that I don't clearly understand what you wish. 
Q.	I shall try to be clearer, if you will.  I am clear, actually.  I shall make a special effort to be clearer.  
So the policemen were there, the gendarmes and the soldiers, to use your term, were there at the roadblock.  How were they able -- the thousand or more weapons that they got from the refugees --
MR. MOSES:
Well, I think as framed, the question is  --
MR. POGNON:
I'm sorry.
MR. MOSES:
I think I had the floor, Your Honours, for my objection.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I am sorry.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, but please wait.  We don't know what he's going to say.

Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.
MR. MOSES:
On what basis is my friend saying there were a thousand weapons?  He's put that to the witness as if that's a fact.  On what basis has he done that?  It needs to be established before he can put that to the witness as a --
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, Madam President, I think my learned colleague would do well to be courteous enough to let me continue with my questions instead of standing up to make insinuations that are, in themselves, answers.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we are sorry.  When you talk about a thousand or so weapons, the witness never said this, so please rephrase your question, if you please.  

The objection is sustained.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Were all the refugees armed? 
A.	I do not know.  I was not in charge of carrying out verifications to determine whether all the refugees were carrying weapons.  But you should use your common sense.  There were women and children and young girls.
Q.	How did these people carry away the relatively high number of weapons, that is, the armed refugees, from which you have excluded women and children, had brought into the church? 
A.	They took the weapons away.  In any case, they took away all the weapons that they found inside the church. 
Q.	I shall read out to you your statement of the 15th of November 1995. 
MR. POGNON:
This page is K0023013. 
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	First, do you remember -- do you remember that on the 30th of January 2003, the investigators came to see you so that you could confirm all the statements that you had made previously?  This is on the 30th of January 2003. 
A.	Do you think I remember that date, Counsel, now?  What is more, I think that you said that you are supposed to limit yourself to what I say to the Chamber now.  So when you refer to statements that I may have made to the various people who came to see me, I should like to point out to you that I did not speak in their language.  There were interpreters.  I believe that I understand that they were speaking in the language that the investigators themselves spoke; however, it should be known that I was not an interpreter.  There was an interpreter there for the investigators, and I think it is up to them to comment on the statements that you refer to. 
Q.	Are you saying that the statements that we are reading here are not your own statements but the comments of those who interviewed you? 
A.	If you are referring to something I said and I notice that I did say it, then I shall consider the point to you, but if I realise that perhaps this is not what I said, then I will tell you so as well.
Q.	Thank you.  So I shall read it to you.
MR. POGNON:
This is from K0023015, which is manuscript of 1991. 
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	These are your statements, as taken down by the investigators on the 15th of November. 

"Question:" -- this is at the beginning of the page -- "Were the victims armed? 

"Answer:  No.  The Tutsis were not armed."  

I have not finished.  I shall repeat.  You interrupted me.  

"Question:  Were the victims armed?"

"Answer:  No.  The Tutsi were not armed.  This church has always been a place where Tutsis took refuge when there were events."  

Did you give that answer? 
A.	I told them that the refugees were not carrying conventional weapons, that is, firearms, and that they were actually carrying traditional weapons.  I did say that they were not carrying firearms but that they were carrying traditional weapons. 
Q.	I read out to you the answer that you gave.  I shall also read out to you the statements or, at least, the statement of the 2nd of February 1996, which you also confirmed on the 30th of January 2003. 
MR. POGNON:
I think in the English version it is K025904, page 1435.  In French it is 1973, that is, page 1973, and the K number is K0230003.  This is towards the bottom of the page for the French version.  Based on the question, I hope that the Court has found the page.
JUDGE HÖKBORG:
No. 
MR. POGNON:
For the English (sic) version of the interview of the 2nd of February 1996, page 1973, and the English version is 1435, page 1435.  

May I proceed? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	This is a question-and-answer session.  This is your answer:  "The people in the church were not armed.  I saw no weapons in the church.  I haven't seen any weapon in the church."  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And Counsel reads in English.
MR. POGNON:
This is towards the bottom of the French page, in the French version.  

May I proceed, Madam President?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may proceed, Counsel.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Is this your statement? 
A.	I told you -- I told them that they were not carrying firearms, but that everyone had left his home carrying a traditional weapon and that those who were able to arrive at the church with these weapons had them still.  It is the person who wrote down -- the person who wrote down that there were no weapons in the church who made a mistake.  It was not true.
(Pages 1 to 11 by Priscilla Trillo)




	1000H
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	So the person who interviewed you made a mistake in taking down your statement and fabricated a statement that is not yours; is that it?
A.	He was mistaken about one thing.  He was mistaken in saying that -- that no one had come to church with a traditional weapon.  What the refugees did not have were firearms.
Q.	In your statement of 17th February -- that is 7th of August 2000 -- 17th of August 2000, I beg your pardon.  I'm referring to the statement of 17th August 2000, I repeat.  We have looked through the pages backwards and forwards.  You referred to grenades.  You talked about the weapons of the assailants, and you did not at any point mention the weapons of refugees.  I am just noting that at no point in time did you mention the matter of refugees being armed. 
A.	If I am saying this, write it down.  Correct it.
Q.	Let us turn now to what you call the meeting of the Accused with the authorities.  Were you accustomed to visiting that parish?
A.	Yes, I used to go there occasionally to attend mass.  I didn't used to go there very often.
Q.	Prior to the events, you visited the parish occasionally.  What was the prevailing atmosphere in the parish? 
A.	You mean -- before we sought refuge at the parish, the atmosphere was good.  There were no problems.
Q.	Were you a member of an association in the parish such as a choir, a congregation, a catechism group?  Were you a member of any particular association?
A.	I am not a member of any association, and I have never been a member of any association whatsoever.
Q.	You arrived at the parish on the 12th of April; that was on a Tuesday.  On the following Wednesday there were many of you refugees.  In your opinion, is that a normal situation in a parish?
A.	The situation was exceptional.
Q.	Thank you.  Notwithstanding the fact that it was exceptional, was it worrying?
A.	Did we seek refuge light-heartedly?  Prior to the events, people lived in harmony.  I never attended mass.  In any case, during the events, people were not happy.  If they had been beaten up on the road, nobody would have been happy.
Q.	Thank you for the answer.  Thank you.  If I go by what you have just said emphatically, the people who sought refuge there had left their homes, their cellule, and some of them, if not all of them, were armed with traditional weapons, isn't it? 
A.	Some of them were armed, while others were not. 
Q.	I agree with you.  I just want you to confirm to me that that was the case. 

So my question is as follows:  What can the Accused who resided in the area do?  Of course he lives there with other people.  What can he do when, because of the events, the parish is invaded, on the one hand, by refugees carrying traditional weapons, as you would call them, and on the other hand, invaded by assailants who are waiting to come to blows with those refugees?  What can the Accused do under such circumstances?  I mean Father Seromba.  What does he have to do?
A.	He was capable of doing something.  We respect him.  If he had wanted to do so, he would have organised mass for us after we handed in our weapons.  On the 14th he refused to say mass.  And the assailants did not disturb him in any manner; he was not attacked in his rear courtyard, that is, the presbytery rear courtyard.
Q.	Do you think someone can celebrate mass in a church full of armed refugees, refugees armed with machetes, cutlasses, and sticks?
A.	No one can say mass under those circumstances.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreters did not hear the counsel's question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you put a question to him.  Allow him to answer it.

Witness, we are listening to you.  Did you finish your answer? 
THE WITNESS:
What I wanted to say was that he could have said mass, and we would have agreed to put aside our weapons.  We respected him.  We could not have made the sign of the cross with the -- with weapons.  We could not have done so with weapons.  In any case, he could have said mass. 
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Just one question.  On the other occasions when attacks were launched, that was earlier in the 1990s, had the refugees carried weapons to church?
A.	There was no war in 1990, a war that would have prevented members of the population to go to church.  It was only in 1994 that we sought refuge in the church.
Q.	I take your answer as it stands.

I asked you what Father Seromba and the other clerics who were in the parish could have done, and you said he could, at least, have said mass under the circumstances you yourself have described.  Did it suffice for him to say mass?  Would that have eased the situation in the parish, was very preoccupying with refugees armed and assailants armed, which was even more preoccupying?
A.	That did not suffice to ease such a situation.  He could have said mass and then sought protection for us.  There were soldiers, and he was on good terms with the communal authorities.  He could have agreed with the commune authorities and the soldiers and anyone, for that matter, who would have come to kill the people who had sought refuge there.
Q.	You said somewhere that you saw soldiers in the parish, you saw police officers, and you even saw the bourgmestre; is that correct?
A.	I saw various categories of people.  I saw soldiers, I saw police officers, and on the Thursday I saw the bourgmestre accompanied by Kanyarukiga and Kayishema, and they went to the upper floor of presbytery.
Q.	You were afraid and you went to the church.  Everyone was afraid.  The Tutsis, armed, sought refuge in the church.  The assailants were armed.  The church was surrounded.  Were you able to imagine that the few reverend sisters and clerics who were in the parish could have been afraid themselves?
A.	Why would they be afraid?  None of them were attacked.  The assailants did not go to the presbytery.  Nothing disturbed them.  We were the ones who were attacked, not them.
Q.	When you say you were attacked, did you mean that no one in the presbytery was killed?
A.	In the presbytery?  I am not aware of anyone killed therein.  All I know is that we were attacked, and I never witness any attack whatsoever launched against the presbytery.
Q.	When you saw the father on that morning of Wednesday that was ten years ago, what makes you think that he was not concerned with the situation in the parish and that he was not afraid?
A.	The fact of the matter is that he spoke to us with anger.  In any case, his face had changed, and he had a stern look on his face.
Q.	Do you know what he looks like when he is happy?
A.	I used to see him looking happy when he said mass.  He was happy, and members of the population were pleased with him.
Q.	On that Sunday, was the atmosphere a typical Sunday atmosphere, the priest meeting his people after mass in a jubilant atmosphere?  Was the atmosphere the same?
A.	After mass, I used to go home.  And when you refer to the atmosphere, what atmosphere are you referring to?  We were in a multiparty politics era.
Q.	I thank you.  I take your answer as it stands.  I thank you.

When you saw the bourgmestre arrive, did the idea cross your mind that the priests in the parish, since there were many of them, call the bourgmestre to come and sort out a situation that fell under his area of jurisdiction?
A.	How many priests are you referring to?  I told you that there were how many priests?  You make mention of several.  When I saw the bourgmestre, I thought he was going to study the problem with the priest in order to find a solution to our problem of insecurity in order to protect us.  I was therefore not the one who sent those priests.
Q.	You saw the bourgmestre and you thought he had come to study the situation?  If you thought that, could you not have thought otherwise, or in addition to that, that it was indeed -- who had called him to come and sort out the situation and that is why he had come to the presbytery?
A.	I saw him simply come.  The priest welcomed him, and they went up to the top floor.  I don't know whether the bourgmestre had come at the priest's request.  I personally thought the bourgmestre had to come to the scene where there were problems.  I thought that, together with the priest, he had to resolve the problem of refugees who had sought refuge in the priest's premises.
Q.	Was the situation of thousands of persons administered by the bourgmestre, which had become turbulent and which was even a belligerent situation, is such a situation such that it could be resolved by a priest of the parish that is occupied?
A.	The bourgmestre and the priests, do they have to resolve problems faced by thousands of people?  No.  They offer the problem -- the solution to problems of members of the population of the commune in their entirety.  The population of the commune is not only about a thousand people.  I thought he had to resolve the problem of refugees.  Assailants were attacking us, and the bourgmestre was capable of preventing the assailants from doing so.  He should have stationed police officers to provide for our safety.  The priest and the bourgmestre could have found a solution to that problem together.
Q.	The priest's house was occupied.  Let us make reference to this house.  You stated that the bourgmestre and the priest had to find a solution.  If I was to say the priest had sought the assistance of the bourgmestre to resolve the situation, to ease the situation that had become very turbulent and establish order in his parish, what would you say?
A.	I did not tell you that the buildings of the parish were occupied.  I referred instead to the church.  I told you that Father Seromba welcomed the bourgmestre, and they went upstairs in the presbytery.  I did not hear what was -- transpired between them because I wasn't with them.  I should not think -- for them, they know what they told one another.  They know what happened.
Q.	Since you are *************, do you know what the bourgmestre's powers are and what the communal police officers' powers are and what the powers of the gendarmerie are?
A.	I don't know the prerogative of the soldiers.  What I know is that they provide for the safety of the country.  As for the powers of the police officers, they provide for security in the commune.  As regards the bourgmestre, his powers consist in giving orders.
Q.	I thank you.  To corroborate what you have just said, I will read your statement, that is, your statement of the 15th of November 1995, K number 002315, K002315.  And the page of the English version, which contains a lot of graffiti -- I'll try to find it.  The English page is 0259037, K0259037.  It is a transcript that contains lots of handwritten notes and cancellations, of course.  It's page 002315, and it is question number 11.  And the -- on the English page it is question number 11 as well. 

Question put to yourself:  "How does the communal police function?"  Answer: "The communal brigadier commands communal police officers.  The number of these depends on the finances of the commune.  There are currently 11 of them, including those who keep the communal seal.  The brigadier reports to the communal administration and the authority of the bourgmestre.  During the massacres, the brigadier was Christophe Mbakilirehe.  The role of the communal brigadier is to provide for the security of the commune." 
Did you make that statement?
A.	It's very clear.  What have I just told you, Counsel? 
Q.	I want you to confirm what you state through something that you stated yourself, and it's reported in the same document which you seem to challenge. 

Right.  Can we take it that when you saw the bourgmestre, it was because he had been invited by those whose parish was occupied and that he had come for that purpose to sort out the problem?
MR. MOSES:
Asked and answered, Your Honours.
THE WITNESS:
But you put that question to me, and I believe I answered that question. 
MR. POGNON:
We will move on to something which could look like prolégomènes or a precursor of all what will happen and all what we have mentioned which could clarify the situation.

I am referring to the transcript of the 15th of November, 1995, on page 002312, 1994 -- 92, I beg your pardon.  In English it's K02593 (sic).  I repeat, K0259036, K0259036, page 2036.

May I proceed, Madam President?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	This is what you state:  "On the 12th of April at 9 a.m. --" and the English page is before the middle of the page, and in the French page -- on the French page -- are you there? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I believe it is the last paragraph, regarding the French. 
MR. POGNON:
It is question number 5.  Just a minute, Madam President.  Yes, it's at the bottom of the page.  I was finding my way through my notes.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Question:  "How did the attacks take place then?"  You said, "On the 12th of April, 1994, at 9:00, youths from a village attacked a lady, Judith, a wife of Safari, and told her to give them her booklet.  They cut her hand because she refused to give it to them.  And they set up roadblocks." 

Did you make that statement?  Do you acknowledge it?
A.	Her hand was not cut off.  Rather, she was wounded on the wound (sic), and the roadblock was set up above her house.
Q.	Thank you.  Referring to your statement of 27 -- 22 February 1996, and I'm on page 1974, 1974.  English page, 1954, K0259040, page 1954.

Regarding that event, you state the following:  "During that attack on the church, a lady called Judith as well as her daughter called Muhigirwa died in front of -- opposite the church."  What can we understand from this with respect to the two contradictory statements wherein --
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I am in the middle of a question, and I'm being interrupted.  I've made two statements and I want to ask a question, and I'm being prevented from saying what I want to say.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, do you have an objection you want to raise? 
MR. MOSES:
Yes, I do, Your Honours.  The -- my friend is saying there is a contradiction.  The statement I have --
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, each time -- this is what happens --
MR. MOSES:
(Microphone not activated)
MR. POGNON:
-- all the time, because when a person is being asked, you know, the Prosecutor stands up. 

Let me finish and then you can make your objection.  You cannot interrupt me whilst I've made two statements and want to ask a question. 

I think this manner in which the Prosecution is proceeding is not normal at all -- or, rather, we can't work any more under these circumstances. 
MR. MOSES:
Your Honours, my friend --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, can you wait a minute.  We want the English page because we haven't found it yet.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can counsel be requested to put on his microphone while he's speaking. 
MR. POGNON:
It is the statement that was disclosed by the Prosecutor, and I refer all the time to the page, because last time around, the Prosecutor raised an objection with respect to the cancelled page.
MR. MOSES:
I can provide it, if it assists Your Honours.  It's K0259036.  That's the statement of 15 November 1995. 

MR. POGNON:
There's no statement of -- it's the statement of 15 November 1995.  I'm talking about the statement of 2nd February 1996.
MR. MOSES:
There are two statements that my friend has put --
MR. POGNON:
(Microphone not activated)
MR. MOSES:
-- which he's saying are contradictory. 
MR. POGNON:
Madam statement (sic), it is my turn to ask questions, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you wait, Prosecutor, so that Mr. -- Maître Monthé (sic) can ask his question, because so far we don't even know the question he's going to ask. 
MR. MOSES:
Well, with respect to my learned friend, he has asked the witness to date, which is why I interrupted, "Can you please explain the contradiction?"
MR. POGNON:
I will not accept, Madam President, that the Prosecutor should interrupt my question.  That is not a method of work.  That is not how we work, and I will not allow it. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)
MR. POGNON:
Yes, I'm very calm.  And this is not normal.  I mean, there's no equality of arms.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, if we -- I think we do respect the quality of arms. 

Mr. Prosecutor, I said you should wait a minute, because we haven't heard Maître Pognon's question yet, so he's going to ask his question, after which you may raise your objection, but for now, we have not yet heard his question.  He has read two paragraphs from two different statements by the witness, so just wait a little while -- for a little while. 
MR. POGNON:
Please, can you obey the Tribunal and -- we're here to follow the instructions of the Tribunal.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Pognon, please let us control the proceedings the way we think fit.  Thank you.  Yes, he is going to yield.  Yes, Counsel Pognon, can you calmly ask your question, so we can know exactly where the problem lies. 
MR. POGNON:
I am not done yet with my quotation.  Madam President, I would like to refer you, and to you, 
	Mr. Prosecutor, to the statement of 22nd August 2000 -- of 17 August 2000.  The French page is 0259046, page 1946.  And the English page is 0253175, page 1943.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we are already on the page that you indicated to us. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can counsel use the microphone, please. 
MR. POGNON:
The French page is 1969, 1969, 1969, and that's immediately after where mention is made of Habyarimana. 

"I had to leave my house on the 12th -- I must have left my house on the 12th of April, and those very Interahamwe attacked **************, Judith, the widow of a certain Safari, and that's how I decided to ************* to go and take refuge in the church." 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, can you ask your question?
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	With respect to this woman, Judith, wife of Safari, Witness, what happened to her?
A.	In the morning that I was not at the scene, I wasn't very near her, I am telling you -- I'm giving you information as I learnt it.  In the morning, therefore, between 9:00 and 10:00 a.m., the assailants attacked her.  People said that that woman had been attacked and that a roadblock had been set up just above her house and that she was wounded, and she had two bank booklets.  And we went to see what had happened, and since we were becoming -- were increasing in number, the assailants ran away.  The citizenry did not know exactly what to do, so we pursued those people, and when we got to Kabgaye, there were no assailants there.  But on our way back, we saw Kamuganza very close to her home, and we realised that the house was being -- that houses were being destroyed and that the cattle was being looted, and it's at that point that we decided to go and seek refuge.  I, therefore, went to the church where I took refuge. 
Q.	Did you see that woman again, Judith, wife of Safari?
A.	I saw her again at the church.
Q.	And when you saw her -- when did you see her again, and when you saw her again, what happened?
A.	I saw her on the 13th in the morning.  You are trying to suggest that Judith died with her child.  It is not the same Judith.  I'm under the impression that I'm beginning to get a hint of where you want to lead us.  Another woman was attacked called Nyampatsi.  And the person that you called Muhigirwa, from what I understand, is a person that was a victim of an attacker near the statue on the way to the church, and that is where we found her corpse.  So I just want to help you to expedite the proceedings, because I can anticipate where you want to take us. 
Q.	And when you state that woman called Judith, as well as her daughter and a man Muhigirwa, died in front of the -- opposite the church, when you state that, what does that mean?
A.	That Judith also died at Rugabano.  When she was going to the church, she was attacked with machetes, and we saw her corpse there, just as we saw the corpse of her daughter.  As concerns Muhigirwa, we had -- we suffered an attack, and at that point, I saw Muhigirwa's corpse.  I think 
she (sic) had been killed the day before because her corpse was lying above her shop.
Q.	Muhigirwa, is it a woman?
A.	No.  Muhigirwa is a man, is a man who had a small business near that centre.
Q.	But Judith, wife of Safari, that you saw in church again, what became of her?
A.	She was killed with machetes, but I saw her corpse that was lying on the back.
Q.	How many Judiths were there?
A.	There are two Judiths, the one who was the wife of Nyampatsi, and the wife of Safari.  It was the wife of Nyampatsi who was attacked with machetes, and that of Safari was in church.
Q.	Thank you. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Counsel.  Sorry, we can't hear counsel.  He has not put on his microphone.  Microphone, please. 
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Now, we're learning today that there are two different Judiths, one whose hand was cut and another who was killed.  Is that what we should retain today?
A.	That is correct.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We would like a small clarification, Witness.  You said a while ago that Judith, wife of Safari, was injured on the hand, that her hand wasn't cut but she was injured on her hand.  We thought we understood later that she went and took refuge in church and that she was killed in church; is that correct?  It is only the other one, Judith, wife of Nyampatsi, who was killed.
THE WITNESS:
It is Nyampatsi's wife who was killed before she reached the church, Judith, wife of Nyampatsi.  Now, as for Judith, wife of Safari, she was able to reach the church.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
She got to the church, and then what happened to her?  I'm talking about Safari's wife here. 
THE WITNESS:
When I left the church, I left her behind.  I presume that she was killed with the other people who were in the church.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	So in your opinion, there is a Judith who was killed, that is Nyampatsi's wife, and the other Judith, you're only presuming that she must have been killed.  Is that it?
A.	Actually, it's not a presumption.  I am sure, because she's not alive.  When I returned from exile, I never saw her again, so she died at the same time as the others in the church.
Q.	Judith, wife of Nyampatsi, who is Nyampatsi?
A.	(By order of the Court, this answer has been extracted and filed under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Witness, we will need to expunge that from the transcripts and anything concerning *********************. 
MR. POGNON:
I stand corrected here. 
BY MR. POGNON:
Q. (By order of the Court, this question has been extracted and filed under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	Counsel, your question may reveal the identity of the witness.  You shouldn't reveal **********	**************** and the person in question.  I think you have to rephrase that question, and it 	should even be stricken from the transcripts.  So please rephrase your question. 
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Why did you not make a -- draw the distinction between the two Judiths and that you continue to confuse people?
A.	Now, listen, they are different, and stick to my statement.
Q.	Thank you.  I will now refer to a statement that you made, and this is in the statement of 15 November 1995.  It was a question that has been raised, a question that concerns this trial, and the page is page K0023014, right at the bottom of the page, and it's question number 8.  Question 8.
MR. POGNON:
I'm looking for the page in the English version in order to make things easy.  The English page is -- unfortunately, there are very many English pages, the -- with the corrected version that the Prosecutor would like us to refer to and the English version that hasn't been corrected.  The question was not corrected.  Page K0023022 of the English draft, and it is question number 8.  Are you on that page, Madam President? 

The question is as follows.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now, for the page of the English, it's 023, question number 8? 
MR. POGNON:
Yeah, 023.  1983, question number 8. 
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	"To the best of your knowledge, is there a pre-established list of people to be eliminated?"  That is the question that was put to you, and your answer was no.  Did you give that answer?
A.	I did not draw up a list of people to be killed, and besides, I did not go to where such lists were being prepared.  Now, listen, those lists were prepared in offices.  I did not have any work in the communal office.  Ask me clear questions and leave aside those that are not clear.  I was ************.  You shouldn't ask me questions concerning a list that I might not have read.  And besides, I didn't prepare any list.  Furthermore, I didn't have any work with the government services.  Thank you.
Q.	Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, if you have to start a new line of questioning, shouldn't we take a break now?
MR. POGNON:
Yes, we'll be going on to a new line of questioning.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very good.  So the proceedings stand adjourned for 15 minutes.
(Court recessed at 1103H)
(Pages 12 to 22 by Sherri Knox)























(Court resumed at 1120H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is in session.  

Counsel Pognon, please proceed with your cross-examination.
MR. POGNON:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Witness CBN --
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, is it possible for the witness to be directed to come closer to his microphone so that I can see him, because I have a feeling that there is a sort of closed session between he and I from where I'm standing?  Thank you.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Witness, while you were at the church, you were not allowed to harvest bananas.  How were you fed at the church?
A.	You have no interest in asking me such a question.  It is thanks to the good Lord that we survived.  I do not know why you are putting such a question to me.  It is as if you are twisting the knife in the wound.  It is as if you are asking me, "Why did you not die?"
Q.	Mr. Witness, answer the question, please. 
A.	We did not have any foodstuffs.
Q.	Very well.  And how did you manage in the church without any food?
A.	Listen, we managed.  We did not leave our homes with foodstuffs and the priests did not provide us any of those.  We just tried to do the best we could.
Q.	When you say that you tried to manage as best you could, do you mean that you did not try to make things easier for yourselves?  You did not try anything?  You did nothing in particular to that end?
A.	We had tried to harvest bananas to feed ourselves, but we were forbidden to do so.  There were also a few sweet potato farms quite close to the wood below the church.  There are people who tried to go and unearth a few sweet potatoes, but they were chased off.  I don't know for what reason you are asking me such a question.  It cannot advance your cause in any way.
Q.	You had sought refuge in the church with women and children from the 11th for some people, and from the 12th for you, up until the major attack.  My question is: are you saying that nothing was done, that you were provided with no means whatsoever of feeding yourselves?  Do you confirm that?
A.	We never received any foodstuff.
Q.	Did you, in the meantime, receive food from nuns?
A.	Yes.  They served porridge and bread to the children.
Q.	Very well, so there was porridge for the children after all.  For the adults, you stayed hungry without taking any initiative until the major attack?  You took no initiative right up to the major attack?
A.	I told you that all we had to do was to try and get bananas.  For those people who went to try and get some potatoes, they were kamikaze, and I told you that they were chased off.  And I have told you that such a question could not advance your cause in any way.  Please don't insist on it.  I don't see how it can be useful to you.  Please put it aside.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I am the one who decides.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we ask you to answer the questions as they are put to you.  Perhaps you do not see the import of those questions, but the counsel who is putting the questions to you knows what he's about.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Did you have any money on you when you were in the church?
A.	Yes, I did have money on me.
Q.	What did you do with this money?
A.	There is a priest who was supposed to receive this money, so there is somebody who put together all the money that we had.  We gave it to the priest, who finally gave it to Seromba.
Q.	Which priest?
A.	I no longer remember his name, but it was said that he came from Birambo.  That is what I heard people say.  People said that he had just arrived from Birambo.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter did not hear counsel's question.
THE WITNESS:
It was on the 13th.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Is it he who told you that he was going to give the money or the funds to Seromba, or did you consider that since Seromba was the parish priest, the money would, of course, be given to him?
A.	When the priest arrived, he told us this:  "To help us to help you, if somebody has money, try to get this money together and give it to some people, and we are going to take down what every person pays.  Give us this money and we shall try to buy something that would be useful to your survival and the survival of your children."
Q.	Very well.  Thank you.  So, on this 13th, was it in the morning or in the evening?
A.	It was about 10 o'clock.
Q.	Very well.
A.	But listen, this is an estimate I'm giving you.  I was not wearing a watch.
Q.	In any case, we have been using estimates all this time.  There is no need for you to feel concerned about anything.  

So, you have not answered my question.  I asked you whether it is this priest who said that he was going to give the money to Seromba, or you just thought he would give it to Seromba because Seromba was in a way the priest of that parish?
A.	The priest told us that this was a decision that had been taken after due reflection.  He did not tell us that the money would be given to Seromba, but he told us that for our survival, they had decided to see whether we had some money which would be gathered and used perhaps to buy bread and distribute it to the refugees.
Q.	I am referring you to your statement of the 15th of November 1994.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I'm sure you mean 1995.
MR. POGNON:
Yes, indeed.  Excuse me.  I did mean 1995.  I am referring to page 1990.  This is number 13 on that page.  I think the page in the English text is 1983.  Last sentence.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	The first question was, "Do you have anything to state?"  "Yes, I wish to state that even 
Father Seromba and the church participated in the massacres, and the last day of the massacres he even spoke to the bourgmestre of the commune, in his house which is next to the church."  

It is the last sentence that is of interest to us: "While I was at the church, we contributed money so that the priest could buy food for everyone.  He accepted the money which he subsequently embezzled." 

Did you make that statement?
A.	The person who took down my statement did not quite understand what I told him.  I told him that it was another priest who was with Father Seromba who came to get the money, and that that priest had told us that the decision was taken in consultation with Seromba, who had decided that if the refugees had money, that money ought to be collected and used for helping the refugees.  It was not Seromba who came to collect the money.
Q.	I press on.  This is what you stated subsequently: "He refused to allow the nuns to give food to the refugees the last time.  He refused to allow the nuns to give food to the refugees."  Did you utter that statement, that sentence?
A.	I did not utter that sentence.  The people who prevented the nuns from giving food to the refugees told us that if those nuns did not return, it would be because the Interahamwes prevented them from entering the church.
Q.	So the person who wrote here that you said that Father Seromba refused to allow the nuns to give you food did not report exactly what you said; is that correct?
A.	That is not what I told the person who took down my statement.  What is written in that statement should be corrected.  It was the Interahamwe who prevented the nuns from returning to the church.
Q.	Are you aware that the food that the nuns took to the church up to the time when the Interahamwe, according to you, prevented them from doing so, came from Caritas in the parish?
A.	I don't know the origins of the food.  As a matter of fact, it was porridge and bread, but as far as I am concerned, the nuns brought that food from their convent.
Q.	I thank you.  Do you think the nuns could have done that if Father Seromba had not been in agreement with them?
A.	If he had refused that, the nuns would not have done so.  By the way, when the nuns brought food to the refugees, they did not seek Father Seromba's advice for a start.  They brought porridge.  Bringing porridge and bread to children who were hungry was not much food.  There were two nuns who came to give food to children who were very sick.  I thank you.
Q.	Are you aware that it was after consultation with Father Seromba that the nuns started feeding children?
A.	I did not follow any conversation whatsoever between Seromba and the nuns.  I do not know whether he was the person who asked the nuns to come and give food to the refugees.  I thank you.
Q.	Let us now come to the day of the attack.  You situated the day of the major attack, or rather the time of the major attack, between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m.; is that correct?
A.	That is an estimate.  I stated that it was in the morning period.  It was already daylight when the attack took place and I told you that I wasn't wearing a watch.
Q.	I am aware of that.  You did say that and I noted it.  You were in the church, around the church, while others were inside.  You were surrounded by the Interahamwe.  What event, what signal  -- what was the signal indicating the attack?  What signalled the attack to you?
A.	Listen, the assailants started by throwing stones at us.  There was no other opening signal.  The assailants started by throwing stones at us.
Q.	I did not ask you who threw the first stone, no.  Are you saying that they certainly started throwing stones at you?
A.	What do you think they did before throwing stones at us?  And what is written in my statement?  Have I stated anything else in my statement?  The assailants assembled and started attacking us.  That is all they did.  Do you want me to tell you that the assailants were singing "tubatsembetsembe", or do you want me to tell that you they blew a whistle before attacking us?  If you want me to talk about these songs that the assailants sang, I wouldn't be able to repeat such songs to you or to tell you that the assailants whistled before attacking us.
Q.	If I follow what you are saying correctly and extrapolate on your answer, aren't you telling me that the assailants were singing and that someone probably whistled?  Is that what I should understand from your statement?
A.	No, it wasn't one person whistling.  Many people had whistles and were whistling.
Q.	Regarding that, are you aware that in the fury of ancient wars, when the two enemies confront one another, the war cry is raised?  Are you saying that at one time, through whistling, or blowing of whistles, the war cry was raised?
A.	Listen, you're giving yourself work unnecessarily.  The attack was launched by people who attacked us usually.  As time went on the attacks intensified.  We heard people whistling.  For instance, we could see someone leading a large scale attack, and such a person was considered as the leader of such an attack, and at times the attacks were well organised.  If you want me to give you names of those who led the attacks, do so, and I will get you their names.
Q.	Well, I will get to that.  I'm coming to that.  I therefore note that a whistle was blown.  

Did the attack start with the blowing of whistles on all sides where you were surrounded, or the whistling came from one side and then was echoed by the others beginning with those who threw stones?
A.	The first attack came from the direction of the statue.  We defended ourselves, and when we were about to repel the attack, the soldiers fired into the air and the assailants returned to rest, went back to rest.  Up to the time when the assailants attacked us from all sides, we faced the attacks and the assailants withdrew and returned, and at one time we were attacked from all sides of the church.
Q.	I thank you.  It was a battle, a war, so let me put this question to you.  Where were you in person situated during those attacks?
A.	Listen, I was in various positions.  I went left and right.  I went just about everywhere.
Q.	Left and right and just about everywhere, right.  Did you know the leaders of those attacks?
A.	I can give you the names I remember if you wish.  There was, for instance, a certain man called Gatana, Bazimaziki, Barisaba, Gatwaza, Sindabyemera, and Habarugira.  Those are the names I remember.  If you find other names in my statement, please let me know.
Q.	Was there also a person called Nzabarinda?
A.	He wasn't leading attacks, but he was one of the assailants.  His group was led by Barisaba.
Q.	Was one of them called Rwagasana?  
A.	He was also amongst the attackers, Ndayisaba. 
Q.	Was there also a person called Hitimana?
A.	Counsel, could you please repeat the name?
Q.	Hitimana?
A.	He was in another group.
Q.	What group was that?
A.	I no longer recall the person who was leading that attack.  By the way, that is the person who threw a grenade against us.
Q.	So it was Hitimana who threw a grenade at you?
A.	Yes, he was the person who threw a grenade at us while we were in the rear courtyard, and it was thanks to a eucalyptus tree that I was able to avoid that grenade.
Q.	At what time did he throw that grenade?
A.	Listen, it was a Friday, Friday the 15th.
Q.	At what time during at attack?
A.	Don't ask me to give you a time.  Please, you can ask me, "After you suffered that grenade attack and avoided it, did you continue fighting?" but don't ask me questions regarding time.
Q.	Right, right.  From where did he throw the grenade?
A.	How do you expect me to describe the location?  He came from the path that was from the cemetery.  He passed through a bush; he came close to a storey building, crossing little valleys there, and then he threw a grenade very close to where I was.  There was a eucalyptus tree.  There was also a cypress tree, and the grenade was caught in that eucalyptus tree.  I saw splinters.  I saw people wounded who were raised up and who were taken inside the church.
Q.	Does it mean that at that moment in time during the fighting, you were in that location and your life was only saved thanks to that tree?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Can you give us the exact situation, that is, where you were at that time in relation to the church?  In relation to the boundary of the presbytery, where were you exactly?
A.	I was standing near that eucalyptus tree, opposite the storey building.  I was also facing another house which was used as a kitchen, if I am not mistaken.
Q.	Opposite the storey building, were you facing the main front of that storey building, or you were behind the storey building?
A.	Behind the toilets.  In front of the area where I was standing, there were toilets.  There was also a eucalyptus tree, but when you turned back, you could immediately see the storey building.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I would now like the Chamber to show the witness the sketch of the premises so that he can tell us exactly where he was in relation to the presbytery and the church.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The investigator's sketch, you mean?
MR. POGNON:
Yes, the investigator's sketch.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, move over to the overhead projector in order to answer Counsel Pognon's question.  This is Exhibit P. 2A -- Prosecution Exhibit P. 2A.
THE WITNESS:
I cannot read this sketch.  If you have a photograph representing the church, I would perhaps be in a position to help you.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	I will help you to find your way on the sketch, to situate the various locations.  Where you have a cross is a church; agreed?  You can put your pen -- point to -- that is it.  That is the church.  The big building you touched first of all, you pointed to, is where the priests resided.  Please touch it with your pen.  That is it, that is where the priest used to live.  

The small house opposite is the priests' office; that is the secretariat.  Please point to it as well.  That is it.  

Up there, that is not it -- the investigator who put it, so you have the church where the cross is.  Then you have the small office there, and the priests' house, which is a storey building.  It is the only storey building on the premises, and it is marked "P".  And the circle around it marks the boundary of the priests' courtyard.  Could you touch it, please.  That is it.  That is the boundary of the priests' courtyard.  It goes from the secretariat, goes behind the presbytery.  Are you following me?
A.	I am following you.  If I understand correctly, we are talking of the road that passes near the statue, and then we have the church courtyard and the small road in front of the church, and then we head for the chapel, but before we get to the chapel, the fighting took place in this location that I am indicating, so you have the entrance to the garage, and up there in the corner were the toilets, and the eucalyptus tree was located at that spot.
Q.	I thank you.  So at the time when you were almost hit by a grenade, that is where you were, isn't it? That is where you were.
A.	Yes, very close to the eucalyptus tree.
Q.	From where did see the man Rukara throw the grenade?
A.	I don't see the banana plantation on the sketch.  He was in a bush.  He was in the banana plantation, on this part.  In the inner courtyard, there's a kitchen.  He went around the storey building.  He tried to pass behind the kitchen and he threw the grenade at us while standing inside the banana plantation.
Q.	Can you give us a rough idea as to where he was on the sketch?  On which side was he in relation to the church and the presbytery? 
A.	He was on this side. 
Q.	I thank you. 
MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, for the record, can we indicate where the witness had pointed to?  He said "this side", which is going to be unclear on the record.  We all know where he pointed to, Your Honour, but for the record, we need to establish that the witness pointed to the inside.  I'm not trying to put words into anyone's mouth, I'm simply saying that for the record, the witness has pointed to the inside.  Thank you, Your Honours. 
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, the witness has pointed to a spot.  The picture can be screened again.  The sketch with be projected.  The witness has shown a location which was in the perimeter that is marked "Nyange" on the sketch.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Counsel. 
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, we agree that that place is outside the presbytery, outside the drawn perimeter of the presbytery.  I think we agree on that.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Witness --
A.	He was outside behind the latrines, but the latrine was in the inner -- inside courtyard.  It was very close to the kitchen, and there was a eucalyptus tree near.  It wasn't inside the premises of the presbytery.  It was outside.  Nobody could get into the premises.  It was from outside that he threw grenades, and it is just below the latrines as I stood near the latrines -- near a eucalyptus tree that was close by there.
Q.	I think the witness can go back to his seat.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Pognon, when do you think -- do you think you are going to conclude your cross-examination with the witness this morning? 
MR. POGNON:
I still have some questions, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No, do you think you still have many questions to the extent that you will go right up to this afternoon?  So I think we should try to conclude the examination of this witness.
MR. POGNON:
Of course, Madam President.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	I am going to read your statement of 11 November.  It is the statement -- well, we are on page 0023014, 1992 for the French version.  We are on page 0023022, page 1994 for the English version.  

Well, before reading, was it when you escaped luckily, thanks to that grenade, thanks to that tree, that you went away?
A.	I retraced my steps and then realised that assailants were coming close to the refugees and people were discouraged.  The refugees had become discouraged, and when I saw the assailants coming closer to the refugees, and who had started killing them with machetes and other sharp objects, that is when I fled.
Q.	And then you only came back after the war; is that it?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Translation -- counsel says he didn't hear the translation.

THE WITNESS:
Yes, I came back after I returned from where I had taken refuge.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Thank you.  I am now on page K002301 (sic).  That is question number 5, and on page 1984, K00230224, the English version, question number 5 still.  "What happened?"  Question: "What happened thereafter?"  "The first attack against the church took place at 9 o'clock.  On the following day, the massacres continued.  I saw the gendarmes who were guarding the church to explain to the villagers, the attackers, how to use the grenades.  The villagers then threw -- the villagers then threw" -- I think the French version -- I suppose that is a grenade, "and I was not wounded, thanks to the pillar of the church behind which I had hidden myself."  The English version is clearer. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And he is reading the English version right now.
MR. POGNON:
"-- was not wounded, thanks to the church pillar behind which I had sheltered myself." 
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Was it in the church?  Was it behind a church pillar that you sheltered yourself, or behind a tree which you called a eucalyptus tree that was in the forest?  Is the place you pointed at in this sketch?
A.	Do you want me to answer you? 
Q.	Well, that's why we are here.
A.	I never talked of a pillar because there was no pillar in front of the church.  It was a eucalyptus which was behind the latrines.  It was a eucalyptus tree.  There was cypress trees that were planted there on that side as well.  It wasn't in the forest.  It was immediately behind the latrines.  The tree was not in the forest.
Q.	If I were to remind you that this statement was read to you on the 30th of January 2003, and that you corrected certain things in the statement, but not what I have just read out to you, now, what do you have to say?
A.	What I can say is that the interpreter did not say what I told him correctly, and I have repeated this to you on several occasions.  Regarding the grenades, it wasn't only one grenade; there were many grenades.  And I mentioned in particular the one that was thrown, but that did not explode.  If you want me to explain what happened for the grenade to explode, I can do that as well, because I suppose that that is written in my statement, by the way.
Q.	You stated a while ago, and on the sketch you showed where the grenade exploded where there was a tree that you described as eucalyptus trees since the time the Prosecutor was examining you, and you said that the place you were at was close to the kitchen, but outside the perimeter of the presbytery.  Do you we agree on that?
A.	Yes, I agree with you.
Q.	I am going to read your statement to you, your statement of August 2000, and we are on page K0259046 -- 1948 on the English version.  In the English version we are on page K0273176.  We are at the middle of the page, the last but one sentence of that middle page for the French version, page 1942, and for the French, we were at the bottom of the page, and I read: "Soon after --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, I'm hearing the Kinyarwanda booth instead. 
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	"Soon after, people started throwing grenades at us.  I escaped from one of them by sheltering myself behind a tree.  When we were fighting, men were standing outside while the children and the women and the wounded were hiding inside the church.  Where I was hiding was in the forest behind the presbytery.  That forest still exists today.  I was scared by that grenade, and I fled towards the lake." 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"And I fled towards the ravine."  The interpreter stands corrected. 
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Now, that tree, from what has been read to you, is it near the kitchens outside the perimeter of the presbytery, or is it in the forest behind the presbytery?
A.	I believe the person who wrote down the statement to the effect that the eucalyptus was in the forest imagined that any tree would be in a forest.  What I said was that the eucalyptus tree was near the kitchen near the latrines.  I think the person simply thought that any tree would be found in a forest by necessity, although that it is not true.
Q.	You know that all the statements that I've been reading here, including this one in particular, were read to you on 30th of January 2003 and that you confirmed them.
A.	But the person who was reading those statements, in effect, was reading the statement in his language, but I am telling you that nobody could have gone into the forest to fight there.  We were inside or in the premises of the church, and that is what I told you, and I showed you the wall.  I showed you where the latrines were, and I showed you where the tree was standing.  The cypress trees are still there, and the tree in question is still standing there.
Q.	I confirm the reading.  Thank you for your answer, and I continue to read your statement where I left off.  It is the same sentence that is continuing. 
JUDGE HÖKBORG:
Before you go on to the next question, I would just like to remark that on page 1958, which is the corrected page in English, there have been corrections made to the answer under five.  One of these corrections is that on 15 April, he saw gendarmes, et cetera, and the other correction is, "The villagers then threw them," and that is the grenades, "outside the church."  The earlier word there was "inside the church".  Thank you.
MR. POGNON:
Your Honour, I am at your service to all intents and purposes, and I would like you to show the area to me because I have this version which is a version that was confirmed on 30th April, and in that version, which was reconfirmed on the page that I have just indicated to you -- we are dealing with the transcripts of 17 August 2000 and we are on page 1948.  It was the end for the French version, that is, it was the bottom of the page, and for the English version, we are on page 1963.

Just a minute, please.  On page K21 -- K0218704, 1963.  It begins in the second paragraph with the sentence, "On Friday morning," et cetera.  And I'm dealing with the sentence that begins with, "Later in the afternoon, people started," et cetera.  And I'm reading this out for the benefit of the Honourable Judge.

Now, the sentence says the following: "I escaped from one of them," that is the grenades, "by taking shelter behind a tree, by hiding behind a tree.  I escaped one of them," and the sentence continues, "The tree behind which I was hiding was in the forest behind the presbytery, and that forest is still there today."  The statement was confirmed on 30th of January 2003.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Now, to move to the next question, should I take it that you feel that the investigators, in writing, that it was behind a pillar of the church that you took shelter, did not quite capture what you said?
A.	Yes, the person who wrote down the term "pillar" or the word "forest" made a mistake.  What you should retain is that I hid behind a eucalyptus tree which was not in the forest, but was near the latrine.
Q.	So you want us to take that -- to retain that only today only after having -- while it was written in terms in 1995 that you were hiding behind a pillar and that that is what saved your life, and that in 2000, it is a tree behind a forest that saved your life?
A.	I did not hear you.  Yes, I was hiding behind a tree.
Q.	But not behind the forest?  Not a tree in the forest?
A.	No, it was a tree that was behind the latrines, near a row of cypress trees, and immediately after that, there was a small banana grove.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can counsel always put on his microphone before he begins his sentence.  I miss the beginning of his sentences most of the time.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Are you surprised that with respect to that phase of things on that Friday, your statement mentions two different positions that you stood at, and that in the Chamber you have mentioned a third position, a third place, which, according to you, was the place at which you were?
A.	Yes, if you are referring to the place where the grenade was thrown.  As for the other events, I was moving this way and that.
Q.	Thank you.  I'm going to refer to your statement of 17 August 2000.  But before that, you stated that you used to go to the parish, and this is my question, that you went to the parish no more than seven times.  Do you acknowledge that?  Do you confirm that?
A.	Yes, I was talking about the number of times I saw him.  I'm talking about Father Seromba.
Q.	Does this mean that you saw Father Seromba seven times, but that you went to the parish seven times, or that all the seven times that you went to the parish, you saw Father Seromba?
A.	There were times I saw him when I went to attend mass, but there were other times when I would see him moving about in the presbytery.  I used to live nearby.  Sometimes he used to take a walk and I would see him, and that at other times I would see him when I went to attend mass.
Q.	Well, being a Catholic Christian, do you want to say that you visited that parish more than seven times and that you saw him only seven times there at the parish or elsewhere?
A.	I'm going to repeat this to you.  I have told you that I saw him at different locations, but I am pointing out that I saw him no more than seven times.
Q.	You saw him at different locations, you saw him in church, at mass with his sacred vestment; you certainly saw him outside church.  Was Father Seromba somebody who, like other priests, was always in a cassock, or were there times when he would dress in civilian clothing?
A.	He wore his cassock when he came to celebrate mass, but when he was elsewhere or when he went out, he was in civil clothing.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Pognon, it is 12:30.  It is time for us to take our lunch break, but I would like to draw your attention to the fact that this witness was questioned between 50 minutes to one hour, and apparently you are already taking six hours for your cross-examination.  How much more time do you need? 
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, this is a witness that is accusing the person we are defending.  It is obvious that the Prosecution is at ease, is comfortable, where the Defence isn't, and by our cross-examination, we have the crucial duty of ascertaining certain charges and ascertaining the truth that we want to bring to light in this Chamber, and that is why we are going step-by-step to question him over things he declared during the 45-minute examination that was led by the Prosecution.  I definitely still have certain questions to ask him on certain issues.  That is all I can say.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
However, I would like to request that you try to conclude, because it is particularly laborious, so we will thank you.  

We are meeting at 2:30 with the same witness.  

The Court stands adjourned. 
(Court recessed at 1233H)
(Pages 23 to 34 by Trevor Gerbes)


(Court resumed at 1430H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is in session.  Counsel Pognon, the floor is yours to proceed with your cross-examination. 
MR. POGNON:
Thank you, Madam President.  

Good afternoon, Madam President.  Good afternoon, Your Honours.  Good afternoon, Witness CDN. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Counsel. 
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Before I proceed, Witness, I would like to refer to your testimony given last Friday in response to a question put to you by the Prosecutor.  I'm referring to page 33 of the draft transcript, which is what we have.  This is on line 23, 23 to 25.  This was about grenades. 

Question from the Prosecutor:  "Which persons were hit by the grenade?" 

Answer:  "Some were hit by the grenades.  I was standing next to a tree in the rear courtyard of the presbytery."

This morning we saw that your -- in your preceding statements regarding the church, you said that you didn't see this.  Then you said that there was a eucalyptus tree, and then you talked about a tree in the forest behind the presbytery in response to the Prosecutor's question that I read out.  Last Friday, you talked about a tree.  You were standing next to a tree in the backyard of the presbytery, and this morning's version that you gave to us was that you were sheltered by a eucalyptus tree, which was on the side of the presbytery which you indicated as being near the latrines.  What is your response to this in comparison to your statement of Friday last?
A.	Grenades wounded people in the morning.  The grenade wounded a certain Senkware and the girl who is were with Senkware.  These people were taken into the church.  Counsel, I told you that I was not in forest.  You're insisting on this, and you say that I was in the rear courtyard.  I did not make that statement, Counsel.
Q.	Very well.  I have just read out the statement of last Friday, your testimony of last Friday.  I thank you.  

This morning we examined the manner in which you usually saw Father Seromba.  In the statement of the 15th of November -- this is the 15th of November 1995 -- and the statement of the 2nd of February, you did say that Father Seromba did not help you.  However, you did not indicate a particular position that you occupied during the major attack.  Why is this so?
A.	Father Seromba did not participate in any attack.  And he helped no attack.
Q.	Thank you.  In your statement that you gave on the 17th of April 2000, this is K0259046, 
page 19046 - and this is page number 1946.  So it is K0273167, and it is 1942 for the English version.  So I would like you to explain something that struck me in your statement.  You said -- I shall indicate the line.  This is on the first third of page 1948.  You said, "The next morning I was outside the church."  That's not it.  It is the sentence that follows:  "Father Seromba was in civilian dress.  He was not armed, and he was moving about alone."  The Defence is intrigued by this sentence.  What do you mean by "He was not armed"?  "He was not armed.  He was in civilian dress.  He was not armed.  He was moving about alone." 
A.	It was the 13th.  They are the events of the 14th.  When he came down to join us in front of the church, he was not armed.  I saw him armed on the 15th.  He was at the -- on the upper storey of the presbytery.
Q.	My question is as follows:  Before you even saw him armed -- you are reporting events that occurred at a given time, a time prior to the events.  And you describe this person by this negative statement in the sense that he was not armed.  Is it because before the events even began, you had seen him armed once before? 
A.	He was not carrying a weapon.
Q.	I shall now turn to this statement of yours, but before that, where were you during the battle when you saw him on the balcony?  In what position were you during those Friday attacks?
A.	I saw him moving about on the upper storey of the presbytery, and I was standing in front of the church.  And when I saw him, the attacks had stopped; the assailants had withdrawn, and this is when he was moving about with this gun.  He was on the upper storey of the presbytery.
Q.	Give us an approximate. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I didn't hear the first part of counsel's question. 
THE WITNESS:
You're always asking me to give estimates.  I saw him moving about armed with a gun between 10 and 10:30. 
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Where exactly were you standing?
A.	I have told you that I was near the church, and I was standing on one of the walls of the church which faces the place that the (unintelligible) used to enter the presbytery.  If I remember correctly, the place where I was standing was opposite the presbytery building, the storey building. 
Q.	Very well.  So you were opposite the secretariat of the presbytery?
A.	No.  When I'm telling you about the war, it does not mean automatically that this is the secretariat.  I have told you about war.  Let the photo be shown. 
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, in this regard, can the sketch be shown, that is, Exhibit P. 2-A.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you want the overhead projector to be used?
MR. POGNON:
So that we can all see it, yes, that would be best.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If you would please pull the curtains so that the witness can move. 

Witness, will you please approach the overhead projector. 
MR. POGNON:
The photo is not visible.  The photograph is not visible here.  I mean the sketch.  The sketch does not appear here.  All right, we can see it now. 
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	(No interpretation)
A.	I was here.
MR. POGNON:
Perhaps these places should be indicated.  So he was in the alley, almost at the end of the alley, and it is from there that he saw Father Seromba on the balcony. 

Madam President, I have finished with him in respect of identifying the location on the sketch.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you may now return to the box. 
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I would like the record to show that he indicated a place that is in the alley between the presbytery and the parish.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, would it not be more accurate to say what -- between what used to be the church and the secretariat?
MR. POGNON:
No.  It is after the secretariat.  It is in the alley. 

(No interpretation)
THE WITNESS:
No, it is not towards the end of the road that I was.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	So where were you?  But this is what you've just indicated.
A.	That was on the veranda, and it was opposite a wall of the garage where vehicles were kept.  It was not opposite the secretariat. 
Q.	I did not talk about the secretariat.
A.	But you have just said so, Counsel.
Q.	No, I did not talk about the secretariat.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is I who spoke about the secretariat, Witness.  So this alley is between the church and the presbytery wall -- 
MR. POGNON:
(Microphones overlapping)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Where there is a small building.
MR. POGNON:
Yes, the kitchen.  I think the place that he indicated is two-thirds into or two-thirds along that alley.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	You confirm that you saw Father Seromba with a gun from that location.  Do you wish to confirm what you said?
A.	Yes, I confirm it.
Q.	Thank you.  You said that he was -- he had the rifle slung across his shoulder; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	You also said something which I shall read out to you.   I shall return to this later.  In your previous statement -- let us enter those.  Those are the statements of the 15th of November 1995, which is a date which is close to the event.  When you were already accusing Father Seromba of having taken part in the massacres, why did you not give this extraordinary detail, that is, that he was carrying a gun?
A.	I have always said it, unless it was not taken down.  I did say it.  And if it was not written down, you, yourself, may write it down.  He had a gun. 
Q.	Thank you.  I shall return rapidly to this sentence that you said you spoke, which is on page 1988, 0261948.  It is on the second sentence of the last paragraph.  I shall read:  "Father Seromba was watching the scene from the balcony of the presbytery."  The Defence is worried about your use of the words "watching the scene."  What do you mean by "watching"?
A.	This means that he was looking at what was happening and he was standing on the upper floor of the presbytery.  He was moving about, and when he arrived at the right side, he was pacing from the right to the wrong side -- to the left side.  He was near the wall that I mentioned to you later.
Q.	So when you say "watching," you mean that he was looking at what was going on?  Is that what it is?
A.	He was there.  He didn't do anything.  He was idle.  He didn't do anything to save us, and he did not even fire a single shot to disperse the assailants.  He was just there watching, and he did nothing.
Q.	Thank you.  I shall now return quickly to the scene in which you escaped from the premises.  I am on page 1947; the K-number is K0259047.  I am going to ask you to excuse me for the questions I am going to put to you in respect of a sentence that you spoke.  I am not intending to shock you.  It is because we are before this Court and we need to find the truth by all means, granted it was by the law.  And this is your statement:  "I left my family behind me knowing that I could do nothing for them.  The only way to survive the attack or the assault was to run away from this place."  "I left my family behind me knowing that I could do nothing for them.  The only way to survive the assault was to run away from this place."  You also said -- before I put my question, I should indicate where we are.  We are on page 1948, 250240 -- 59046.  That's the K-number.  It is the last-but-one sentence of that page.  "When we were fighting, able-bodied men stood outside; whereas, the women, children, and wounded persons hid inside the church."  With all due respect for your family, this is the question I wish to put to you, and with all due respect for your pain, this is my question:  You were fighting outside to protect women, children, and wounded persons.  And at the first opportunity, you left coldly.  In cold blood, you left your family, and you mean that you could do nothing for them and that the only way to survive was to escape this place.  Did your family -- did your family also not need to survive this hell? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor.
MR. MOSES:
I find that question completely objectionable, Your Honours, completely objectionable.  What basis is that -- if he wants to say why did you leave, by all means, he can ask that question.  But to try and place some blame, as my friend's question tends to do, on the actions of this witness is completely objectionable.  I am quite happy if he wants to ask him why he left.  That's a perfectly reasonable question.  But for him to go further and frame his question in the way in which he has, I find that completely objectionable and I ask that Your Honours do not permit it to be asked in that manner. 
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I can answer this objection.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Pognon, if you would be so kind as to repeat your question.  You talked about 
cold-bloodedness and all that.  Would you please rephrase your question, because these are things that are likely to disturb the question.  Would you please rephrase your question.
MR. POGNON:
The witness himself will agree that I have tried to approach this as tactfully as possible.  I began by condemning the misfortune that befell him.  I used a sentence I did not dare to use -- start -- put the question without using his own sentence.  He said this:  "I left my family without" -- "I left my family knowing that I could do nothing for it.  The only way to survive the assault was to run away."  Beforehand he had said that the able-bodied fighters were outside and that outside they were protecting those who were inside the church, the women, the children, and the wounded persons.  So if the Prosecutor, who thinks that I'm tactless, wants to say this, I will put the question like this: why did you think - 
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	While you had defended your family and the family of all other people, why is it that at that particular time, you thought that the only way for you to survive was to leave, and leave your family behind as you, yourself, said?  Answer the question. 
A.	I believe you know what it means when you are fighting because when you are fighting, you try to defend yourself.  In Kinyarwanda, it is said that when there is danger, each person tries to save his own life.  I tried to escape.  Unfortunately, I was able to save my life.  I did not go along with any member of my family.  I left them there in the church.
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness.  You'll bear testimony with me that I deplored what happened to you.  I also have a heart, even if the other party on the other side does not believe so.  Thank you very much for your answer. 
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, at this stage of my cross-examination, on account of what will come after, I will request that we go into closed session because I'll be calling out names.  And if I couldn't call out the names, the record will not be clear.  Any objection, Mr. Prosecutor?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We would like to apologise to the public.  We are going to go into closed session in order to protect the witness and in the interests of justice.  Thank you.
