MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is in session.  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  Witness, good morning.  Can you hear me?  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let me reiterate what I said earlier.  Mr. Witness, can you hear me?  
THE WITNESS:
I can hear you, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  The Prosecutor has the floor -- my apologies.  Counsel Nekuie, you have the floor.  You can proceed with your examination-in-chief of the witness which you had started yesterday.  Thank you. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, Your Honours, good morning.
 EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness FE56, good morning to you.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness FE56, yesterday when we adjourned, I had asked -- I had put to you what the gendarmes and the soldiers who were posted at the church were operating under the orders of Father Seromba.  And in response to this question, you mentioned a meeting held on the 11th of April 1994, convened by the bourgmestre during which the decision to deploy the soldiers in the commune had been made.  Is that correct, Witness FE56.  
A.	This is, indeed, the response I gave to this question.  I said that the meeting of the 11th of April had been convened by the bourgmestre, and that it was during that same meeting that it had been decided to deploy the gendarmes.  And I also told you that Father Seromba did not attend the meeting.  The decision to bring the soldiers to the church was one of the recommendations of the meeting.  
	Father Seromba had no information on the matter. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE56. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam President, before I proceed I would like to know whether we are still in closed session because the first questions I have for the witness might reveal his identity. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No objection, Mr. Prosecutor?  Very well, we shall now go into closed session so as to protect the witness, and in the interest justice.  I regret to the members of the public.  Counsel, how long shall we sit in closed session?  

MR. NEKUIE: 
For approximately 15 minutes, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 3 to 5] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Nekuie, we are now in open session, you can proceed. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Obliged, Madam President.
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	FE56, those attackers who had surrounded the church, were they people who were faithful to Father Seromba? 
A.	Counsel, thank you.  I believe I had explained to you that it wasn't Father Seromba who had invited those attackers, and I gave you the names of those who were in charge of the attacks.  It was those same people who had gone to apply for equipment from Estaldi offices, like the trucks on both of which the attackers came from the Kibilira commune.  And so those attackers were brought to that place to attack the refugees who were there.  It was a plan that had been drawn up by Ndunguste and Kayishema and Rushema.  It is those three individuals who were brains behind those who had come to kill those who were at the Nyange parish. 
Q.	Thank you, FE56.  It has often been said that in Rwanda, priests and members of the clergy had a lot of influence on members of the population.  Through your answer, were you trying to say that Father Seromba or his influence was not brought to bear on those attackers from Kibilira who had come on that day? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  You can, yourself, imagine the situation.  How can an ordinary priest exert any control over those people, the bourgmestre and other officials of the commune?  In addition to those communal officials, you had to add, or you had to think of leaders of political parties.  There were things being done within political parties and the political leaders exerted influence on the members of the population.  If those people had not supported the massacres, I would say that they would be the ones to prevent the attackers from taking on the refugees, and they could do so. 
Q.	Thank you, FE56.  Let's now go back to the meeting that took place on the 11th of April 1994 summoned by the bourgmestre.  Were you supposed to attend the meeting?  If that were to be the case, why didn't you attend then?
A.	Thank you.  I was not personally supposed to attend that meeting that took place on the 11th of April 1994.  That was a Monday.  The meeting had been summoned by the bourgmestre.  And I think those who had to attend that meeting were the conseiller du secteur, heads of department at the communal level, and leaders of political parties.  I think those were the people summoned to the meeting.  For sure, I was informed that such a meeting did take place, but I wasn't supposed to attend. 
Q.	Do you know whether that committee was able to meet the next day, on the 12th of April 1994? 
A.	Counsel, could you repeat your question?  I didn't quite understand. 
Q.	Willingly, FE56, you said that there was a meeting of the committee that took place on the 11th of April 1994.  And I am asking you the following question:  Did that committee meet again on the 12th of April 1994, or some other day after the 11th of April 1994?  Were you able to know whether any such meeting took place? 
A.	Thank you.  I told you that I learnt that the meeting of the 11th of April took place; that it was actually a security committee meeting at the communal level.  It was an emergency session.  I noticed, maybe you are confusing this meeting with the meeting of the committee that was set up after the church was demolished.  It was a crisis committee.  And so, the crisis committee was established during that period.  And so when the meeting was convened by the bourgmestre, that crisis committee was not existing.  The crisis committee was made up of the bourgmestre, Kayishema, Habiyambere Joseph, who was the president of the tribunal du canton.  There was also Telesphore Ndunguste who was the MRND political leader -- party leader.  Then the first conseiller and the second one, Anastase Rushema who was the deputy chairman of the MDR party.  So the crisis committee was established after the church was demolished.  And that name, namely, crisis committee was given to it. 
Q.	Thank you for those clarifications, FE56.  And to round up this information, when did that crisis committee starts to function, when exactly? 
A.	I would say that crisis committee started operating after the 20th.  It was set up after the 20th and it started operating. 
Q.	Thank you, FE56.  Is it possible that such meetings be held at the parish prior to the demolition of the church? 
A.	Thank you.  ******************** the communal office, and most meetings were those that brought together heads of departments.  In actual fact, these were meetings at which the development of the commune was discussed.  And they took place -- the meetings took place at the communal office, I believe in French those meetings were described as meetings of the technical committee or technical commission. 
Q.	Thank you, FE56.  So you never heard at the time that any such security meeting took place at the parish between the 11th and the 15th while you were there? 
A.	Thank you.  As far as I know, no meeting took place at the parish. 
Q.	Thank you, FE56.  Tell me, Witness, between the 11th and the 15th of April, did you have any opportunity to go to the parish?  I mean, before the 15th of April.  
A.	(As an order of the Court, the whole answer of the witness has been redacted and put under a separate cover)
Q.	Thank you, FE56.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam President, for the record, and for the protection of the witness, I would like to request the Court to ask the booth to spell the names, and to what extent it would be possible for this part that deals with his own identity. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
To be moved into the closed session.  We should have started in closed session for that part.  

You may wish to spell the names and then maybe we should ask that all that portion of the testimony be considered as belonging to the closed session.  Fortunately, there is no one in the public gallery.

Could the Kinyarwanda booth assist us, please?  
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Yes.  **************************************************************************************************************. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Can I proceed, Madam President?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Sure you can.  My hope is that with respect to your future questions, there would be no risk. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Well, normally, there shouldn't be. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You can then proceed. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	FE56, based on your testimony, it would appear that the refugees themselves wanted to go to the church to hide there or to seek shelter there.  Is that what I should understand from your answer? 
A.	Thank you.  What I can say with respect to that question, I think the church -- the church set up some place where people sought refuge.  They felt secure as was the case in 1959 when people had sought refuge there, and no one could attack those people at that place.  In 1973, the refugees went to that same place, and no one attacked them.  It was usual for them to seek refuge at that place.  And each time there was some alert, some warning, people would go to that place.  That had occurred.  And so, in 1994 when people heard that there was unrest or disturbances, they tried to go there.  Immediately after the president's plane was brought down, people started fleeing towards the church because Ndunguste had attacked a Tutsi family, and this was known throughout the commune and people were afraid.  The bourgmestre went to enquire about the situation so as to be able to identify the perpetrators.  Some people were arrested by the communal police and taken to the communal office.  But, Kayishema, the IPJ, released them because he wasn't obeying the orders of the bourgmestre.  So those people were released.  In fact, that was the reason why people took fright and started fleeing towards the church. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE56.  Do you know whether the people who attacked the refugees in their homes were doing it with the assent of Father Seromba at the time? 
A.	No.  Sir, can you notice that were affected by the attacks are quite remote from the parish?  There is no link, whatsoever, between these attackers who were going against the Tutsis and 
	Father Seromba. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did you hear at the time that Father Seromba went about the hills to encourage the Tutsi to come and seek refuge at the church? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  There have been allegations whereby Father Seromba would have incited Tutsis to seek refuge in the Nyange church, but I myself never heard that. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE56.  While you were at the church on the 13th of April 1994, what was the state of the refugees who were there?  Were they -- for example, did they have food or what were you able to observe? 
A.	When we reached the parish, along with the people who drove us there, we found refugees there.  And when they saw the people we were taking to the parish, they acclaimed us.  They were happy because they had thought that the persons we were bringing there had been killed, 
and they were happy to see that they were still alive.  Some had arrived at the church before the first attacks took place, and they were saying, "Well, we thought you had died.  Thank God you are still alive", which proves that the refugees felt safe in the parish and that they were happy.  I would say that they had not been mistreated.  So this is the answer I can give to your question and these are the explanations I can provide. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE56.  When did the first attacks you mentioned take place exactly? 
A.	The first attacks took place the day after the plane -- the president's plane was brought down, when it was announced over the radio that the plane -- the president's plane had been brought down, the news spread throughout the commune. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE56.  And were you able to determine when the first attacks against the Nyange church took place at that time?  Do you have the exact date? 
A.	I only know about the attacks that took place on the 15th of April, and it was on a Friday.  That was the first attack against the church. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE56.  Did you hear subsequently that there was an attempt to attack the church on the 14th of April 1994?  Did you get such a piece of information? 
A.	As regards the attack which took place on the 14th, there is not much I can say about it because I was not informed that it took place. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE56, for your candidness.  Witness FE56, can you tell the Chamber whether before the attack of the 15th, which you are well aware of, the refugees who were in the Nyange parish were free to come and go out of the parish without being prevented from doing so? 
A.	In response to your question, I can say that before the attack of the 15th, even the other members of the public could supply the refugees, food.  They could bring them food.  So this is the information I was given at the time.  So people could go and give food to the refugees, but that is all I can state. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did you hear of people who went to bring food to the refugees at the time?  Do you remember? 
A.	Thank you.  I, for one, did not see anyone bring food to the refugees.  This is just information that was given to me by passersby, or that I heard.  It was hearsay.  Before the attack, I was told that friends would bring food to the refugees.  Thank you. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness, FE56.  And when you yourself escorted the families you mentioned earlier on to the church, did you provide them with food? 
A.	Thank you.  As you well know, we decided to take them to the parish as they would be safe.  We had not planned on providing food to them or bringing food with us because we believed, at the time, when they had left their homes they had already eaten.  And since they were going towards the church, we knew that the CARITAS organisation had food for people such as them -- for the refugees.  So regarding the food supplies, we have thought that the refugees would be able to find food at the church. 
Q.	Thank you for your clarifications, Witness.  So, Witness FE56, you were convinced that the CARITAS organisation would take care of the refugees at the church, which was a reasonable way of seeing things.  If we go back to the attack which occurred on the 15th of April 1994, can you tell the Chamber whether at the time you were leaving the church, you had any knowledge that the church would be destroyed the next day on the 16th of April 1994? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I believe I explained previously that it was only after the church was destroyed that I heard about this event.  I explained that when I was leaving the church, there were people who had been deployed around the church to guard the church.  And I don't know how the bulldozer that destroyed the church was brought into the church or into the courtyard.  But I learnt that Anastase Rushema went in a vehicle driven by Jean Uwimana, in a vehicle which belonged to Rwamasirabo and Rushema and went to commandeer the bulldozer which belonged to the Estaldi Company.  And besides, he had brought the bulldozer which had been used to bury those who had died on the 15th, the previous day.  So he was the one who also brought the second bulldozer which was used to destroy the church while there were still refugees inside the church.  So this is the information which I got.  But, once again, when I left the church on the 15th, the decision had not yet been made, and I had been given no prior information in that regard. 
Q.	Are we to understand, Witness FE56, that, to your knowledge, on the 15th of April 1994, there was no plan to destroy the church? 
A.	If there had been another way to reach the refugees who were inside the church after the attempt we made to frighten them out, if it had been possible to dislodge the refugees from the church in any other way, it would not have been necessary to destroy the church. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE56.  When did you hear about the destruction of the church once the events occurred? 
A.	I heard about the destruction of the church on the same day the event occurred.  The church was destroyed on a Saturday.  Saturday was a market day, and many people would go to the market.  So this event occurred on a market day.  I also heard that some of the people who were going to the market were not able to reach the market place.  They had to buy or sell goods on their way to the market, but were not able to reach the market place.  And when they were coming back, they would say that the church -- they were the ones who said that the church had been destroyed or had been bulldozed.  During that same day around 11:00 or midday -- as a matter of fact, from my home, one could hear the noise made by the machine.  And I was told that the destruction of the church started around 11:00.  And I remembered that I had heard the sound of machine.  When one is at my home, for example, and that a vehicle coming from Kigali blew its horn, we could hear that noise.  And when I was given this piece of information, I remembered that I had heard some noise at the time, and that I had heard that noise for quite a while, and I heard that same noise for approximately two hours in a row.  And I realised that the noise I had heard was, in fact, the noise of the bulldozer that had destroyed the church.  So this is how I heard about the destruction of the church.. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness, FE56.  Did you learn whether the attackers from Kibilira who were there on the 16th, were also there on the 15th of April 1994? 
A.	The attackers who came from Kibilira and who participated in the attack on the 15th, according to the information I got, were the very same people who were entrusted with surrounding the church to make sure that no refugee would be able to come out.  And the next day, I heard that Telesphore Ndunguste who had taken them there gave them cows as a reward, but I do not know where he took the cows from.  So this is what I was told on the matter. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE56.  According to you, Telesphore Ndungutse -- Telesphore Ndungutse, sorry, the only one who had asked the attackers to come to the Nyange church? 
A.	Telesphore Ndungutse was not the only one to have taken the initiative.  There was 
	Telesphore Ndungutse, the CIO, Kayishema who used a vehicle belonging to a 
	**************************************************.  And it is on board those lorries that people came from Kibilira, and there was also Anastase Rushema.  They were the supervisors of the attack for the most part. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE56.  Did you know whether Telesphore Ndunguste, the CIO, Kayishema and the third person you mentioned hailed from Kibilira or not? 
A.	In answer to your question, I -- even though I have no confirmation of this information, there was an employee of Estaldi who hailed from Kibilira, and his name was ***************, and he worked along with the people we mentioned.  He got along quite well with them.  And they went to ask for the machines to destroy the church, he was the one who negotiated with them, and he was the one who gave them the equipment which belonged to Estaldi, because his boss who was a white man was not present.  And I thought they would seize this opportunity to ask ************* for the equipment, and ************* came from Kibilira. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE56.  After the destruction of the church, Witness -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, could we have the third name spelt out?  We still do not have it.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
The third name?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you told the witness -- you mentioned a name, but we do not have that name.  So perhaps it could be spelt out.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam President, I did not mention the name because we are in public session -- in open session, sorry, and the name which was mentioned was the name of a Prosecution witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
A protected witness.  So do you still wish to mention that name?  Let me turn to the Prosecutor.  
Mr. Prosecutor, was that one of your witnesses who was mentioned, the third name that was mentioned?  
MR. TOWNSEND: 
I think I will be derelict in my duty if I answer that question in open session, Your Honour.  I didn't catch the name. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, please take note of the name, and when we shall sit in closed session, we shall have it spelt out. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness FE56, I was asking you whether you went back to your position after the destruction of the church?  And if the answer is yes, from when did you go back to your job? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  After the church was destroyed, I resumed work on Thursday which followed the week during which the church was destroyed, following an order given by **********************.  This was after the attack on the 20th, which was led by the bourgmestre, Fulgence Kayishema the CIO, Joseph Habiyambere as well as others.  And amongst them there were policemen as well as the deputy of the commune brigadier.  They had to plan, and in the -- during the night of the 20th, they attacked our -- our commune.  They said that they were coming to search the house of 
	Aloys Bonera whose body had not been found among those that were at the church, so they attacked us.  They searched our house because they knew that we had helped these people to seek refuge at the church.  And since they had not found Bonera's body, they had been told that he was hiding in the homes of those who had helped people to flee to the church.  The attack took place at 10 a.m. They first went to the house of a lady whose husband was a soldier, but the soldier was not there.  She opened the door, saw armed people, ran away, broke her leg.  The attackers went to the next houses.  As the soldiers broke into the houses and they got to my house around 2:00 a.m.  They were with my neighbours who had gone with me to the church with the families we had brought there.  They had searched my neighbour's house.  And those who have searched the house were looking for the individual I mentioned previously.  When they were coming to houses to search them, they would ask the owner of the house to go with them.  And this is how they reached my house.  Bourgmestre Gregoire Kayishema, the CIO, 
	Joseph Kayiyambere (phonetics) and a reserve officer called Habiyambere as well as the deputy of the brigadier, the second deputy of the brigadier.  And there was also a police officer called Adrien Niyitegeka, but all of them stayed outside, and it is only Kayishema and the bourgmestre who entered the house.  They searched the house looking for Bonera, but they did not find him there.  Following that, they went back and the bourgmestre asked ******************************
	********************.  And my answer was that I had -- I did not feel safe, and that there was no security.  I told him that the members of the public did not need to come to the commune for the census taking.  That is how **************************************************** the following Thursday, in order to be able to issue certificates or laissez-passer to members of the public because the security situation was critical.  And this is how *************************.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE56.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Nekuie. 
MR. NEKUIE:   
Madam President, a number of names were mentioned, and perhaps the booth can help us spell them out. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could the Kinyarwanda booth please spell out the names mentioned by the witness?  
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Yes, Madam President.  Witness talked of Ndungutse, Kayishema, those are known.  He talked about **********************************.  He talked of Habiyambere, H-A-B-I-Y-A-M-B-E-R-E; he talked of Bonera, B-O-N-E-R-A; Ndahimana which is N-D-A-H-I-M-A-N-A; Habarugira which is H-A-B-A-R-U-G-I-R-A; Niyitega is N-I-Y-I-T-E-G-E-K-A. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Interpreter. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	FE56, regarding Habagira -- Habarugira, do you remember his first name?  What was that first name? 
A.	I know his first name.  I thought I made mentioned of it.  His first name is Gabriel. 
Q.	Thank you for that clarification, FE56.  What did he do, I mean, Habarugira, Gabriel? 
A.	He came together with that team, in other words, he was one of the attackers who attacked us to search our houses. 
Q.	No, rather, what was his job personally?  Not what you did on the day you were the victims of the attacks; what was his duty?  What was his job, if you know? 
A.	Habarugira was in retirement.  He was a reserve officer.  He was a warrant officer. 
Q.	Thank you, FE56.  You were telling this Court that these attacks were led against the people of your collines by the bourgmestre, is that what we are to understand? 
A.	The bourgmestre participated in those attacks because he was together with Kayishema, the IPJ, and he was a member of the crisis committee I alluded to earlier.  There was 
	Joseph Habiyambere, the president of the tribunal du canton. 
Q.	Regarding that crisis committee, was Father Seromba a member, as far as you can remember? 
A.	I tried to talk about members of the crisis committee.  Father Seromba was not a member of that committee. 
Q.	Thank you, FE56.  *********************************************************************, were you able to see Father Seromba going there to visit the bourgmestre at that time? 
A.	**************************, I didn't see Father Seromba going to the communal office. 
Q.	Thank you for those clarifications.  And from your knowledge of the habits of the bourgmestre, would you know whether it was customary for Father Seromba to visit him prior to these events? 
A.	From what I know, and if I go by the behaviour of the priests who were at the Nyange parish, Father Seromba didn't come to visit the bourgmestre before the events of April.  The priest who used to come to the communal office was the priest of the parish by the name Straton.  I believe I saw him at the communal office and towards the end of June or July.  I don't quite remember.  I don't quite remember the month so as to talk about it with certainty.  It was during the election of the bourgmestre by the political parties.  It was Straton who was in charge of organising the elections.  And there were candidates like Gregoire Ndahimana, who was the MDR party, and Jean-Baptiste Kagenza, who was the candidate of the MRND party.  And Father Straton was the chairman.  He was the one supervising the elections that took place in June.  On that occasion, it was the MDR candidate who won the elections.  His name was Gregoire Ndahimana.  So that's what I know.  So, it was Father Straton Karanganwa who came quite often to the communal office. 
Q.	Thank you.  June or July, which year, Witness FE56, so as to be complete? 
A.	Thank you.  I believe it was in June or July 1993.  When the war erupted, that man had not yet spent one year at the communal office.  I mean the person who was elected.  
Q.	Thank you for that clarification, sir.  In your opinion, when you ************************************************************************************?  Were there roadblocks, for instance, in the commune? 
A.	Thank you.  At that time, there were no longer any roadblocks in our commune.  It was merely to enable members of the population to move around, to go to Gitarama, for instance, because no one could dare move around without having identity papers.  No one could dare go to the market or to go and see a friend without identity papers.  So, I think it is that type of document that can be described as the laissez-passer. 
Q.	Thank you, sir.  When you say there were no roadblocks any longer, are you trying to say that there were roadblocks prior to that date?  And if that is the case, where were they established? 
A.	Thank you.  Yes, roadblocks had been mounted even before the demolition of the church.  I personally -- when we took those people to the church, there was a roadblock at the business district quite close to the church.  And on our way back from the church, it was difficult for us to go across that roadblock.  It was necessary for us to negotiate with those who were manning the roadblocks.  We even had to give them some money, 500 per person so that they can allow us to go across the roadblock.  It was even stated that at that roadblock people were arrested and had to forfeit their properties.  And even if we negotiated with those manning the roadblocks, they did take away some other things that we had.  There was another roadblock which was located at a place known as Kucyapa (sic), about 500 metres from the communal office on the way to Kigali.  I did not appear at that roadblock, but mention was made of it.  That roadblock was mounted on the orders of the IPJ, Rushema.  They were dismounted or withdrawn a couple of days after the church was demolished.  Then in June when the refugees from Gitarama got to the Kibuye préfecture, an order was issued, and roadblocks which used to be at a place known as Kucyapa was again restored.  I think it was withdrawn in the month of July when the refugees started leaving that place so as to go to the Kibuye town.  
Q.	Most grateful, sir.  Now regarding those roadblocks, FE56, did you hear that Father Seromba went specifically to the Kucyapa roadblock after the church was demolished, in order to track down Tutsi refugees, who would be there -- who would be going across there? 
A.	Thank you.  I have always explained that Father Seromba did not participate in those killings, whether they, be against those who had sought refuge in the church, or against anyone else.  If it is been alleged that Father Seromba was at any roadblock whatsoever, well, these are people who merely want to mar his image.  No, I never heard that Father Seromba manned a roadblock.  How could he have manned a roadblock, for one like himself who had not participated in any meeting?  I believe if someone said that Father Seromba manned a roadblock, that would be just lies. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE56.  How far was the Kubyapa roadblock from the parish in your view? 
A.	The distance from the church to that place called Kubyapa was, if I am not mistaken, two kilometres.  
Q.	Thank you, for that clarification.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam President, Your Honours, I have two or three questions to put to the witness in concluding my examination-in-chief, and I would like to do so in closed session, if I am allowed by the Court.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, could we be -- could we be enlightened, is it Kubyapa or Kucyapa? 
MR. NEKUIE: 
It is Kubyapa.  I can spell it.  It just escaped me.  It is spelt K-U-B-Y-A-P-A, Kubyapa.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you seek a closed session.  Let me point out to you that as much as possible, it would be proper to put together all your questions so that we have just one closed session and the rest of it in open session.  No objection from the Prosecutor?  
MR. TOWNSEND: 
None -- none.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, then, we'll move to a closed session for those few questions still to be asked.  So, we are sitting in closed session for the protection of the witness and in the interest of justice, and we apologise to the members of the public.  Counsel Nekuie, I hope this will not going take too much time.  You say three questions.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. Nekuie's microphone.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
I was saying, Madam President, that I don't know how long the witness would take to answer my questions.  Maybe we should take a break and then I put my questions upon resumption.  I don't know, it would rely with the Court to decide.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We would have preferred to conclude with this examination-in-chief before we go for break.  Maybe you should ask the witness to be brief, answering the questions in a specific manner. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well, then, Madam President.

MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Court is called to order.  Can you hear me clearly, Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
I can hear you very clearly, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, you can now proceed with the cross-examination of the witness. 
MR. TOWNSEND: 
Thank you, Your Honours.  
BY MR. TOWNSEND: 
Q.	Witness FE56, if I could ask you to move forward and pull the microphone closer to your mouth so we can hear you.  I am going to ask you questions, most of which you will be able to answer, "Yes, I don't know, I don't remember."  Do you understand that?  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, Counsel Monthé; the Defence would like to point out something that has been tickling us right from the beginning.  Prosecutor has the right to ask all types of questions he would want to, but he cannot impose "A yes or no answer".  What he expects of the witness is an answer, not a form or shape or the answer. I think that kind of practice should be abolished.  We are going to be told again that these are the rules of cross-examination, but I would like that the Court rules once and for all.  He cannot be required to provide a yes or no answer.  I think criminal procedure would require that he provides an answer, that's all.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Duly noted, Counsel Monthé.  Prosecutor, could you put your questions to the witness, please?  
MR. TOWNSEND: 
Yes, thank you, Your Honours. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR TOWNSEND: 
Q.	You are a male Rwandan detainee of Hutu ethnicity, is that correct? 
A.	You are quite right, Prosecutor.  But let me add some other information, some other detail if you allow me.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let me just point out that we are in open session.  
MR. TOWNSEND: 
Your Honour, I am going to start with a couple of photographs and then go into closed session and then do the balance of my questions in open session.  So what I would like to do is start with photograph Exhibit P3-21, that's it.  Mr. Mjui could show that photograph.  You can show it to them, I think everyone would recognise it. 

BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness, you are being handed a photograph which is P. 3-21.  The photograph of a church.  I see it in your hands.  Can you take a close look and tell me if that's Nyange church.  I see you putting on your eye glasses, please do that? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the interpreters of the Kinyarwanda booth have some difficulty, because they would need to see the witness, if he could move a bit.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, could you ask the Witness to sit in the very middle part of the witness box and then move forward.  Where the witness is now sitting, can everyone see him?  Is it okay?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, it's okay, we can see the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So we are now going to continue.  Prosecutor, please.  
BY MR. TOWNSEND: 
Q.	Is that the Nyange church in the photo?  
A.	If I look at that picture closely, it is not the Nyange church.  I could provide you with the basis for my saying so; that is, if you allow me.  Do you allow me to make some comments on it?  
	Madam President, Your Honours, I am seeking your leave to explain why I am saying that this church is not the Nyange church. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, do speak, Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  Now this bell tower was not on the right, it was, indeed, on the left, and I am referring to the Nyange church.  And that's why I am saying that the person who took this photograph -- or, on the photograph, one would notice that the bell tower is on the left. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Thank you for that.  If you can return that to Mr. Mjui, and he is going to show you a second photograph which is P.3-12.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	If Mr. Mjui could find that and then show it around the room and then approach the witness.  If you could show it around the room, please.  
BY MR. TOWNSEND: 
You are going to be shown photograph 3-12.  If you can take a close look at it.  If you need to put your glasses on again, take your time.  And can you tell, me yes or no, is that in the background of the picture, CODECOKI, or can you see CODECOKI on that photograph?  
A.	Thank you.  I think the CODECOKI building was there, as it appears on the photograph.  Can I say something about the photograph?  And I would say that the person who took that photograph was standing after the tarred road.  There's some proof to the effect that this photograph was taken after the construction of the tarred road, otherwise, the CODECOKI building is properly represented on it. 
Q.	And you would agree with me that the CODECOKI building that you see in that Exhibit P.3-12, is behind what is called the Ishushyo (phonetic) or monument of Virgin Mary.  Do you see that? 
A.	Yes, I can see that place. 
Q.	And the CODECOKI building in that photograph, P. 3-12, is the one with a green coloured door; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  The CODECOKI building had doors and windows painted in green. 
Q.	And those doors and windows and that building, CODECOKI, appear in the photograph in your hand, 3-12; correct? 
A.	Yes, quite visible.  It is the building that belongs to the CODECOKI cooperative society. 
Q.	And CODECOKI is an abbreviation for the cooperative pour le development, the commune of Kivumo; wasn't that a fact? 
A.	That's right.  That is an acronym -- an abbreviation, and you have explained this -- the abbreviation. 
Q.	Again this would go much faster for you, if you can just answer, yes or no, I don't know, I don't remember.  The CODECOKI building is sometimes just referred to as the cooperative, would you agree? 
A.	Lots of people call that place CODECOKI. 
Q.	My question was different.  The C-O in CODECOKI is for cooperative.  Would you agree with me, yes or no, that some people just refer to that building as the cooperative? 
A.	That place is referred to as CODECOKI.  Members of the population are not accustomed to the word "cooperative", they use the word, "CODECOKI". 
MR. TOWNSEND: 
At this time, the photos can be withdrawn and I am going to ask questions that relate to this witness's job and identity, and I would move to a closed session to protect his identity.  I have about 20 questions in closed, and I hope the balance of my questions will be in open session, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
No objection from the Defence? 
MR. NEKUIE: 
No.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. We shall now sit in closed session so as to protect the witness and in the interest of justice.

(Pages 20 to 22 by Judith Kapatamoyo)
(Court resumed at 1440H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session.  We will resume our hearing.  Good afternoon.  I see you on your feet, 
Mr. Monthé.  Do you have anything to say? 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Yes, Madam President, I am, indeed, on my feet.  Counsel Monthé is perplexed because when he thinks he has solved the problem, the problem turns out not to have been solved.  Madam President, we have talked about visits to people who know Father Seromba.  Madam President, I understand that when you take a formal decision we cannot go against it.  We have talked about transcripts in which you said there's no problem and I am told that the Prosecutor is against the decision.  So, I would like you to state clearly that this witness can see Father Seromba.  I have talked about this and I am not an administrator.  I hope you will solve the problem, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Monthé.  Counsel Monthé, what is the problem?  The Chamber has already decided that it is possible for witnesses to meet the accused in a group before they leave.  That has been stated here unequivocally and very clearly.  Prosecutor, is there any problem, as far as, you are concerned, regarding such meetings?  
MR. TOWNSEND: 
We expressed this in Chambers so as to put on the record, it's just we want the witnesses to complete their testimony, a lot of them, before they meet with the Accused just if that is clear that's our preference.  I don't know if that amounts to an objection.  Thank you.
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, that is, indeed, the case.  We have filled the appropriate forms and yet the section has denied us permission.  That is why we come back to you because I don't understand anything any more.  And in the final analysis, I don't know whether the Chamber shouldn't issue instructions to the section because for the past two days we have been encountering this problem.  The impression that people have is that I am not doing my work, and I don't like that.  The section should understand, once and for all that there are Judges in this jurisdiction, and that your decisions have to be observed.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Counsel, we will request the registry to take up this matter because we are currently expecting the seventh witness.  They cannot say that there's a group of witnesses who can meet, Father Seromba.  We are not dealing with isolated witnesses.  We have a group of seven witnesses and I believe they have to go back home before the others.  So, we are going to have two waves of witnesses.  So it is high time this problem is resolved.  

Mr. Prosecutor, could you proceed with the cross-examination of the witness?

MR. TOWNSEND: 
Yes, Your Honours, thank you very much.  I was in closed session when we stopped before lunch.  So, I have about 10 or more questions in closed.  So, I would move for a closed session for purposes of witness protection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution.  No objection from the Defence and the Bench has no objection either.  So we shall now proceed in closed session for purposes of protecting the witness and in the interest of justice.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 31 to 35] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera) 
	(Pages 29 to 30 by Judith Kapatamoyo) 



























BY MR. TOWNSEND: 
Q.	Witness FE56, you met members of the Seromba Defence team and gave a statement on or about 
	5th September 2005; do you recall signing that statement?  
A.	Thank you.  I think I signed the statement that I made to the lawyers. 
Q.	In your testimony so far, you have referred to the events of April 1994 as a genocide.  So, you would agree with me that genocide occurred in Kivumo in April 1994? 
A.	Thank you.  You say that in my statement I talked about the events of 1994 -- the genocide, notably.  Even if I tried to explain the situation, as best as possible, I would say that the war broke out in 1990, and the killings of the members of the population began in 1994.  I think that I explained that clearly.  And I know that some people say that it was a genocide whereas others say it was a mere civil war where citizens went about killing each other, but the fact is, those events occurred in Rwanda.
Q.	And you agree that in April 1994 Tutsi civilians were targeted and attacked based on their ethnicity? 
A.	Yes, it is a fact, especially those Tutsis were the ones targeted rather than the other ethnic groups existing in Rwanda. 
Q.	You mentioned that Ndungutse led the attack in Murambi, would that be against the Ndakubana family? 
A.	Yes, that is what I said. 
Q.	Now, turning to the 13th of April 1994 -- did you attend the mass of Sunday, 10th of April 1994? 
A.	I am certain that I didn't go to mass, on the 10th of April 1994.
Q.	Now you testified that Priest Stratton chaired an election committee in June or July of 1993.  You would agree that this was an example of the role the church played in the affairs of Kivumo, correct? 
A.	Thank you for asking me that question.  I am under the impression that the way in which you are asking me your questions is different from the way in which it was initially put to me and my answers are different.  
Q.	I move on to something else.  Let us move on the 13th of April.  You brought some Tutsis to Nyange church on that day; you agree? 
A.	Yes that is how it happened, as I explained to you. 
Q.	And did those Tutsi you brought to Nyange parish on 13th of April 1994 subsequently die on the 15th of April 1994? 
A.	Some of them survived the events at the church.  They came out of the church, but we heard that they were killed subsequently on their way to Kabgaye.  I know that some of them died near the Kanyabarongo River.  If you want me to tell -- if you want me to give you the names of those people, I could do.  People say that most of them were carried on their way to Kabgaye where a lot of people sought refuge.  If you want me to give you the names of those people who managed to reach Kabgaye, I am ready to do so. 
Q.	I don't think that is a good idea in open session.  We could come back to that? 

Now, you took people to the church to be protected on the 13th of April, but you went there to attack that church just two days later?  Do you understand that correctly? 
A.	I am afraid we have not heard the interpretation of the witness's response.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The witness says that it happened in that way -- but he was going to give us an explanation about that. 
THE WITNESS: 
Would you like me to go on?  I have always said, on the subject of those attacks that targeted the refugees; it is true that I went to the church, but I didn't plan ahead, I didn't premeditate my presence at the church, I was taken by surprise and I was obliged or compelled to go there.  I think I tried to explain that point lengthily.  And, furthermore, I am still waiting to be tried today, but I have presented quite a lot of evidence proving that I did not voluntarily or willingly go to the place where the events occurred, but I was compelled to go there. 
Q.	With regard to the events of 15th April 1994, you would agree that there were thousands of attackers gathered there? 
A.	I agree with that. 
Q.	And you agree that because there were thousands, you could not have known all those attackers, correct? 
A.	I tried to explain that point.  I said that there were many people there wearing dried banana leaves who camouflaged themselves with grass in order not to be recognised.  Apart from that, there were other people there who did not or were not wearing hoods and I managed to identify a number of those people, and I think I gave you their names, but if you want me to repeat these names, I can do so. 
Q.	What I would really like to do is for you to try answering my question, because you said some were disguised, you would agree that you didn't know all of them, correct? 
A.	You are right.  They were very numerous and we could not identify them - or, I couldn't identify them all.  They had surrounded the church and nobody could have identified them all.  They also covered themselves with a liquid based in chalk.  In so doing, we could not identify them. 
Q.	Therefore, you would agree, because nobody could identify all of them, you cannot tell us from which cellule all of them came from, correct? 
A.	That is correct.  But apart from the people who arrived in Astaldi trucks, who came from Kibilira, there were also other people who came from other hills, and who were part of the Kibilira group.  But I can't say that I know the names of those people who came from other hills apart Kibilira, nor can I tell you how many people came from such and such a cellule, I wouldn't be able to do that. 
Q.	Would you agree with me that, in your estimated 30 minutes, in your parish, on the 15th of April 1994, 20 of those minutes you were intent on doing what you said you were doing, and those remaining 10 minutes -- amongst thousands of attackers -- did not give you a good opportunity to see about you, namely; if Seromba was present or not? 
A.	If I remember correctly, I believe I said that during that period of 10 minutes, as a matter of fact, those 10 minutes came before the 20 minutes I spent carrying out the task I referred to.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The witness has just indicated his position.
THE WITNESS:  
I could see them from where I was driving people away or trying to intercept those who could leave or who could come out.  I could see the gendarmes were there standing near the door to the secretariat.  So from my position, I could see everyone present on the scene.  I talked about gendarmes; you know, you have asked me not to mention names.  I also saw people pushing others.  I believe I gave their names and if you wish I could repeat them. 
Q.	We don't need these names now, but if you would pay attention not to mention the activity and your occupation, okay?
I have a question about the statement you gave to the ICTR in March 2003.  In that statement you mentioned that a communal meeting was held at the cooperative.  Do you recall making that statement? 
A.	Yes, I remember making that statement; I also remember its contents. In that same statement I stated that someone, I wouldn't mention the name, had talked to me that meeting.  To avoid mentioning the name, I said someone talked to me about that meeting and the person who asked us to accompany those people had told us that the meeting had been held and that the person had received information from the persons we had to accompany that she or he had received the information from the person we were to accompany.  I personally did not take part in that meeting, but I heard about it.  And if I go by the information I received, I do not know whether that meeting was held exactly on the 11th at CODECOKI.  That person gave me that information and I did not try to ascertain whether it was correct. 
Q.	The information you received though, indicated that there was a meeting at CODECOKI on the 11th of April, did I understand that correctly? 
A.	Yes, that is, indeed, what I wanted to say.
Q.	You mentioned a driver named Uwimana, U-W-I-M-A-N-A; does he also go by the name Jigoma, J-I-G-O-M-A? 
A.	Yes, that driver called Uwimana was also nicknamed.  
Q.	And do you recall making a statement saying that Nahimana drove, and Jigoma drove, taking Tutsi from your commune to Nyange church? 
A.	Yes, I remember making that statement.
Q.	Do you recall making a statement to the ICTR investigators saying that Kanyarukiga, Kayishema and Ndungutse were all anti-Tutsi extremists? 
A.	I remember making that statement. 
Q.	And you said that because it was true? 
A.	Yes, what I said was true. 
Q.	And you knew these three gentlemen personally; is that correct? 
A.	I knew those persons.  For instance, the bourgmestre **********************, was someone I could not have avoided knowing.  I also knew Préfet Kayishema, he was from the same commune as myself. 
Q.	Did you know the anti-Tutsi sentiments of Kayishema and Ndungutse before the death of the President? 
A.	Before Habyarimana's death, I did not know of his anti-Tutsi sentiments, but I would like to crave your indulgence here; you said I shouldn't mention names, it's difficult for me to answer without giving names.  That poses a problem to me.  I don't know whether I should answer the question without citing names or whether I am allowed to give names.  I will request your leave to continue. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, are you referring to names mentioned by the Prosecutor himself or other names?  
THE WITNESS: 
I would like to give the names of persons who were attacked under the pretext that the president of the republic had died.  That would enable me to answer the question as to whether I had known those persons' anti-Tutsi sentiments before.
MR. NEKUIE:  
Madam President, I believe the Prosecutor should foresee this kind of situation.  When he puts question to the witness, he should expect this type of stalemates.  He should rather tell the witness to pay attention not to give names that would lead to his identity being divulged and not simply tell the witness not to mention names.   
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, the witness doesn't know whether he should mention names or not.  He is hesitant.  So you should tell him clearly what he should do.  What is certain is that, Witness, you shouldn't give any information that would lead to your identity being revealed.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
I agree, I think that is what I was saying.  I think probably the response is a bit weary.  
BY MR. TOWNSEND: 
Q.	Witness, I think it is okay to say names in open session except if you say name" and give an explanation of how that name is connected to you, like "My neighbour, Mr. Smith --" so, you can name names if you avoid explaining how those people are connected to you as that connection might give away your identity.  Do you understand that?  Is that clear enough?
A.	I have understood you, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Thank you, now my question is a yes or no question.  One of the reasons I ask such questions is to try and make sure you don't touch on your identity.  I think you have answered the questions that you did not know of those persons' anti-Tutsi sentiments before.  I will come to names later if you want to in closed session.  I will move on to a different question.  And my question is:  On the 15th April, you saw Ndungutse and Kayishema meeting with attackers near the Isushu or the Virgin Mary statue; is that correct? 
A.	This is my answer to your question:  You keep repeating the same question over and over.  I don't know whether you want me to give you an answer that will contradict what I said.  I said that 
	Kayishema -- Ndungutse and Kayishema went to bring assailants after negotiating with workers of the Astaldi firm, who gave them the bulldozers and the other equipment they used during the massacres committed at Nyange church. 
Q.	And you saw Kanyarukiga at the same time; is that correct? 
A.	I did not say that I saw Kanyarukiga with my own eyes, but if I go by the information we obtained while in prison, I would say the following:  When the information was being gathered --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the Kinyarwanda interpreter did not understand what the witness said.  Can he be asked to repeat the answer? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, could you please repeat what you have just said, because the Kinyarwanda interpreters did not understand your answer.  
THE WITNESS:
Madam President, Your Honours, I would also like the Prosecutor to repeat his question so that I can answer accordingly.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:  
Q.	My question was:  Yes or no, did you see Kanyarukiga then and there with Kayishema and Ndungutse at Nyange centre? 
A.	I cannot answer this question by a yes or no.  I would need to provide ample explanations. I remember the testimony I gave regarding Kanyarukiga.  People said that wounded persons would go and be bandaged in his pharmacy.  I did not say I saw Kanyarukiga.  What I said was that wounded persons would go to get bandaged in Kanyarukiga's pharmacy.  Furthermore, it was also said that he was an opportunist, but I don't know whether he corroborated with those who went to fetch assailants to carry out the attacks. 
Q.	On the 15th of April when you were near the church, did you see attackers use dynamite; yes or no?  
A.	In answer to your question, it was said that before I arrived, attempts had been made to blow up the church.  That was with a view to massacring people inside the church.  I did not witness that with my own eyes.  I only heard about them. 
Q.	I would like to ask you about gendarmes; did you see them participate in the attack of the 15th of April 1994; yes or no? 
A.	I saw gendarmes because when we went on board the vehicle and when we got to the church, we met Ndungutse -- excuse me, I have just mentioned a name -- as well as a man called Rushema and Joseph Nyambere, they were in the company of those gendarmes.  So that was after the first attack during which people had been killed on the road in front of the church.  

Do you want me to continue giving further information on this matter?  That is why I am of the opinion that gendarmes played a major role.  If they hadn't wanted to play a role in the killings, they had weapons and they could have stopped those who came to kill refugees in the church.
Q.	So, I understand your evidence that the gendarmes played a major role in the attack of 15th April 1994 at Nyange church, and at the same time they were protecting the presbytery; is that correct? 
A.	I dare not say who guarded the presbytery.  That did not concern me.  All I know is that they played a role in the massacres inside the church.  And I indeed pointed out that if they had not wanted to play a role in those massacres, those people wouldn't have been killed.  They would have prevented them from being killed. 
Q.	The gendarmes numbered how many -- about five or six -- what would be your estimate? 
A.	I saw two gendarmes with our own eyes.
Q.	In your statement to the ICTR investigators, you spoke about "Forced marriages" in Nyange, in 1994; would you agree with me that this expression means sex with Tutsi women who did not consent -- or rape? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Nekuie.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, I would like to object to this question.  I don't know if the Prosecutor is trying to make use of the witness statement to the witness.  If he wishes to do so, he should first show the document to the witness so that he may recognise them and their contents.  He cannot take upon himself to put words in the witness's mouth.  If he wishes to use these documents, he should first show it to the witness.  That is my objection, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Objection upheld.  Counsel for the Prosecutor, would you like to show the witness that document? 
MR. TOWNSEND:
Understanding the ruling -- yes.  So this is the statement of the witness given to the ICTR on 13th March 2003, in English and French.  A copy has been given to the Defence already.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:   
Q.	Witness, I understand that you don't speak English or French, correct?  
A.	Yes, but if you have a Kinyarwanda translation I would appreciate if you could show me that translation -- if you have a Kinyarwanda translation, I would appreciate if you could show it to me. 
Q.	What I would like you to do first is to look at the bottom of each of the pages in French and tell me if it bears your signature and if you can confirm that.  

So as to avoid confusion, maybe we can give him the French copy only -- he has both languages. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think that the witness has made a difference -- or has seen the difference between the French version and the other version.  You talked about his signature being appended at the bottom of the French version after all.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you.  I note that my signature is appended to the bottom of the document drafted in French. 
Q.	Witness, can you find the last page in French that has a box on the top which has "Icyimezo," I-C-Y-I-M-E-Z-O?  I think you found it. 
A.	Yes, I can see the name you are referring to. 
Q.	Can you read that first paragraph in Kinyarwanda -- nice and slowly, so we can have an interpretation of it, starting with "IYE," and can you read it aloud? 
A.	"Witness declaration.  This statement has just been read to me in Kinyarwanda.  It is true and complete as far as I am aware.  I made the statement willingly, without any promise or constraint.  I know that this document will be used in a legal framework before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and that I may be asked to appear before the court of first instance of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, in order to testify.  The Appeals Court could also ask me to appear or to come and testify as a witness.  I am aware that any false testimony -- any false testimony could engender legal prosecution against me on the part of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda."  
Q.	And would you agree with me that your signature appears in that box you just read on the page ending -- on the page you just read? 
A.	Yes, my signature is, indeed, appended at the bottom of document.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, it is now time for us to take a break.  Would you mind continuing after the break?  
Court is adjourned.

(Court resumed at 1635H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are called to order.  

Counsel for the Prosecution, please, proceed with the cross-examination of the witness.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you, Your Honours.  With the witness having authenticated his signatures, at this time, I'd move to admit into evidence the witness statement of FE56 as Prosecutor's Exhibit -- I believe, it will be 51 in English and French, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No objection from the Defence?  
MR. NEKUIE:
No objection, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Nekuie.  

Very well.  This document is the witness's statement of the 13th of March 2003.  And it is admitted as a Prosecution Exhibit, with Exhibit Number P. 51A and B; is that it?  P. 51, and A is for the French and B for the English. 
(Exhibit No. P. 51A and P. 51B admitted)
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness, that document doesn't exist in Kinyarwanda, but I'd just like to quote a sentence from it -- read it to you.  You'll hear it interpreted.  And you can tell me if you, indeed, said those words, okay?  
A.	Right.  
Q.	For those following -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Just a minute, please.  

Yes, Counsel Nekuie.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, I would like to know whether the Prosecutor intends to use a second document.  If that is the case, he should simply give the witness a copy of that document instead of reading extracts from it.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
I'm referring to Exhibit 51, the ICTR statement that doesn't exist in Kinyarwanda.  I'm not sure if I understand the objection.  

MR. NEKUIE:
Well, Madam President, if that is the document, he should read it out to the witness because I may have objections on the cross-examination of this witness on this document.  He should read the document under the control of the witness.  The contents may not be exactly what the witness said, and we intend to tender it into evidence.  But the Prosecutor should abide by the Rules of Procedure which should be enforced before this Chamber.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If I understood correctly, Counsel Nekuie would like you to read out the paragraphs you want to put to the witness; is that it?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, indeed, Madam President.  Instead of giving this document to the witness, it should be given to the witness first before it is tendered into evidence.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you also aware that this document does not exist in Kinyarwanda?  It is only in English and French, this particular document.  
MR. NEKUIE:
I know fully well, Madam President.  But before the details of this document are presented to the witness, I believe the witness -- or, rather, there was an additional cross-examination of the witness on this document and I'd like to draw the Court's attention to that.  And I may have some objections.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Defence counsel intends to re-direct on this document.  That is what he is trying to say.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, do you have any objections to the Defence's request that you, first of all, show the witness the statement in question?  
MR. TOWNSEND:
If I understood his objection, it was that it wasn't yet authenticated.  And he had confirmed his signatures before the break.  And it's already an exhibit.  And now I'm going to read a sentence from it and to put a document in front of the witness that he's not able to read, I submit, would not help anyone in the Chamber.  And we've lost about seven minutes on this objection.  If I could be allowed to proceed.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Have you given those documents to the interpreters -- I mean, the witness's statement?  Very well, proceed, Mr. Prosecutor. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	For those following the written word, I'm referring to page 6, in French, the fourth to last paragraph, but I want to lay a little foundation first.  

Question, Witness:  In your statement you referred to "forced marriages".  When you use that expression, are you referring to nonconsensual sex or what's called rape?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, this is my answer:  I believe that in the statement I gave, I told ICTR investigators that when information was being collected in our prison, some persons admitted to having forcibly married women and girls.  Wherever they took those girls in the bushes in the villages -- they took those girls and -- they took those girls to their homes and forcibly married them -- or, rather, made them their wives.  That is what I stated on the 13th of March 2003.  I don't want to give the names of the men who forcibly married those women, but I believe I gave their names.  
Q.	My question is:  When you used the expression "forcibly marriage", are you talking about sex with Tutsi girls in April 1994 that was not of a consensual nature?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Objection, Madam President.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, there were girls who were abducted by youngsters and taken to their homes, and those young girls were subsequently turned into their wives.  Those are the girls I'm referring to.  That is what was said when information was gathered in the prison.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Since the witness has answered the question, Madam President, I withdraw my objection.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, could you please proceed.  
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Now, you've used this expression "forced marriage" or that abducted girls were made wives.  Do I understand that the abducted girls that were made wives were forced to have sex against their will?  I'm trying to say if there was sex involved.  
A.	Yes, of course.  There was no consent from those women.  However, those women were lucky to survive.  They were not killed as had been the case with other women.  I wouldn't say that they were lucky to find husbands because they were forcibly made their wives.  On the other hand, I would say that they were lucky to survive since those youngsters took them from their homes and made them their wives.  
Q.	Now, referring to your statement of 13 March 2003, the last two sentences of that paragraph that I referred to before, starts in French, "Le militaire", and I'm going to read it to you and you can confirm or deny making this statement.  

I quote:  "Soldiers living at the presbytery also married girls.  Unfortunately, I no longer remember the names of those girls."  

Do you remember making that statement to the ICTR investigators?
A.	Yes, I remember.  I remember making that statement.  Since all that information was given during the information gathering exercise, either on that date, that is, the 13th of March, I tried to provide investigators with information in line with what I had heard in prison when information was being gathered. 
Q.	Now, the use of the word "soldier" here, did you understand that to be gendarmes at Nyange presbytery; is that correct?
A.	Of course.  I believe I explained that, at times, we called gendarmes soldiers in our country.  I spoke of soldiers, but I meant gendarmes.  Sometimes people mix up gendarmes and soldiers.  
Q.	And when you said "married girls", do I understand when you gave that statement that you were saying that these were Tutsi girls that had been raped at Nyange presbytery?  Is that what you understood and said?
A.	Thank you.  I am not in a position to give you the answer that will satisfy you because I was not an eyewitness.  But if I go by the information I received, those girls who were forcibly abducted by those young men and made their wives, that is, wives of rapists -- those girls were taken to the homes of the rapists, but it was said that those girls had first been raped by the gendarmes at the presbytery before being abducted by those youngsters. 
Q.	And just to confirm, that would have been in April 1994; correct? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Prosecutor, we do not know where you are headed with these questions.  Could you enlighten us somewhat?  You have been talking about this for a long time and we don't know what you are driving at.  Could you please enlighten us on this?  
MR. TOWNSEND:
If you would like submissions as to the relevance, I'm happy to make it.  I am not sure if you want that in front of the witness.  That was my last question, was just to ask:  When -- was it in April 1994?  This goes to causing grave bodily injury at Nyange parish.  I'd also add that it goes to credibility, Your Honours, and any subsequent denials of this by previous witnesses and future witnesses.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Nekuie.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, I do not see the link between these allegations and the Prosecutor's questions with the credibility of the witness, the Prosecution case and issues raised in examination-in-chief.  These are the limits of cross-examination, Madam President, and these questions do not fall within these limits.  So I would appreciate if Madam President could put an end to this line of questioning.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, could you please remove your headset, please.  

Prosecutor, could you please explain to us why you are following this line of questioning because we still have not understood.  Maybe you could explain it to us now that the witness is not following our conversation.  You may address the Court.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
My pleasure, Your Honours.  The purpose of this line of questioning is to prove, one, the credibility of previous witnesses that have testified to the fact; it is to sure up or to support the witnesses that may come after him; thirdly, to refute any denials of these allegations by the Accused and subsequent witnesses.  So that's all on terms with credibility.  

With regard to proving our case, which we have a burden to prove beyond reasonable doubt, genocide can be committed by grave bodily injury and rapes is a constituent element of genocide, Your Honour.  So whether those acts are attributable to something for final submissions, but it is strictly relevant to the crime of genocide, Your Honour.  Those are my submissions.  My question, just to remind, Your Honours, was:  Was this in April '94?  That was my very last question on the subject.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Nekuie.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Madam President, I would just like to point out to the Chamber that the Prosecutor is talking about rape.  And he, in fact, drafted the indictment in which he did not talk about this charge.  And, secondly, Madam President, the document that he is using is, in fact, a document that his investigators drafted on the occasion of the interview with the witness, so those facts were also brought to their knowledge and they didn't react to it.  He didn't ask this witness to come here to testify on the subject of rape, so I don't see why it should be included in the cross-examination.  I don't see how or why he should try to examine the credibility of the witness through this testimony.  So I will talk about this myself and base myself on this document when I re-direct.  So I don't think the justifications advanced by the Prosecution really have any basis.  Thank you, Madam President.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
The -- briefly, the presence of this statement -- in his ICTR statement, goes to the credibility of this very own witness, that he's confirming what he said before.  So it's relevant for the credibility of this very own witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, the Chamber unanimously is of the opinion that this line of questioning is not appropriate.  We do not see the connection between these forced marriages and the allegations against Father Seromba, the charges.  So these facts were never mentioned here in the past, so please move on to something else.  Thank you.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you, Your Honours.  

BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness, I'd like to turn to the 16th of April 1994.  You weren't present at Nyange; correct? 
MR. TOWNSEND:
I just observed that we haven't instructed the witness to put his headset on.  I'll withdraw the question and put another one to the witness.  
BY MR. TOWNSEND: 
Q.	Witness, on the 16th of April when you weren't present at Nyange, it was a market day, so you would agree with me that that people from the area close to Nyange market would have been present there that day; correct?
A.	I would like to ask you to repeat the question because I didn't quite grasp it.  
Q.	You said that the 16th of April 1994, as a Saturday, would have been a market day, and although you weren't present, would you agree with me that locals, from living close to where the market was, would have been present that day there?
A.	I still don't understand the question.  I heard you talking about the 14th, a Saturday.  I'd like to ask you to repeat the question, giving me the precise date, please.  
Q.	My question is about the 16th of April.  As a market day, would have -- people from nearby the market have gone to Nyange, yes or no?
A.	Thank you.  I understood the question this time.  I told you that on the Saturday I didn't go to Nyange, so I'm not in a position to tell you whether the citizens living near the market went to Nyange parish or not.  I do not have any information to that effect.  
Q.	Based on your previous experience of Nyange market days, on Saturday, would you agree that the persons that went there were from living nearby; would you agree?
A.	They were not the only ones to go to the market.  I'm talking about the members of the population who lived in the surrounding area.  
Q.	I'd like to ask you about rewards.  You testified that those remained overnight from the 15th to the 16th were rewarded with cows.  Do you recall that testimony? 
A.	I remember having made that statement and I specified that that information was given to me.  I was not an eyewitness to the events, but I heard what happened, and I heard that some people had received cows as a reward.  
Q.	Now, the person who gave rewards, did you ever hear that it was Counsellor Jean-Marie Vianney Habarugira who was involved in cows or rewards in anyway in April 1994?  
A.	According to the information I was given, I heard that Ndungutse distributed the cows to those people who had guarded the place overnight, and referring especially to those attackers who had come from Kibilira.  I also heard that Ndungutse had given those cows as a reward, but where he had taken them from was not mentioned. 
Q.	My question was:  With regard, specifically, to Habarugira, did you ever hear he was involved in rewards or giving cows, yes or no?
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Nekuie.  
MR. NEKUIE:
I would just like to object to this question because we did not talk about Habarugira, we talked about Habarugira -- we talked about another Habarugira during our examination-in-chief, not the same gentleman.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
I think that counsel's objection is that because I talked about one person I'm not entitled to ask about another.  And counsel will note that I didn't make a single objection during his whole direct.  I'm not sure if I understand the objection or how to respond, Your Honours.  This goes to credibility.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, could you go on to another question, please.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
I understand the objection to be sustained; correct?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
In fact, the witness answered the question so you may move on.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you, Your Honours.  
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Now, you talked about a different Habarugira, reservist, Gabriel Habarugira.  Do you agree that he became an active soldier and was in uniform when you saw him somewhere around 20-22 April 1994?
A.	To answer your question, I told you that during that period he came in order to accompany those people who were conducting searches.  And on that occasion, he was not in military dress, but he was dressed as a civilian.  
Q.	Thank you, for that.  You recall your testimony earlier where you said in giving statements, even in Rwanda, you always said "Seromba played no role".  Do you recall saying that?
A.	In all the statements that I gave, most people who were interviewing me asked me questions about the public prosecutors' officers in the province before 2000 or the year 2001.  And there are a number of documents containing my statements.  I was asked questions about Father Seromba, and what he might have done, I answered by saying that I was bringing no allegations against Seromba because anybody who did bring allegations against Seromba had their sources of information.  The documents exist, and if those documents were shown to me, I could provide an explanation.  
Q.	Did you ever hear it said that "Seromba might have given a green light to bring the machine to demolish Nyange church"?  Did you ever hear that said, yes or no?
A.	After the church had been demolished by bulldozer, different people -- numerous different people were asking themselves questions on the subject in order to find out who had given the authorisation for the church to be demolished.  They were wondering whether it was Father Seromba.  So that's the kind of question that people were asking themselves, but they didn't say that a priest living within the parish itself could have dared to give authorisation for his own home to be attacked.  People were wondering a number of things, notably, whether Father Seromba did give the authorisation.  And other names were quoted.  And people were trying to establish who exactly was responsible for the act.  We did not receive any confirmation that it was Father Seromba, but people were wondering whether, by any chance, it was he who had given the authorisation.  
Q.	Did you, personally, ever make a statement saying, "It was said that Seromba might have given a green light to bring the machine to demolish", referring to Nyange church; yes or no, did you ever make such a statement? 
A.	I think that I never made such a statement to the investigators that I met.  In the excerpt you say that people might have been -- might have said so, but I think that people were wondering exactly who had given the authorisation for the destruction of the church.  They were wondering whether it was Seromba who had given that authorisation.  I don't know whether he was the one -- I don't know whether the person taking down the statement actually wrote that people thought it was him, but I think the person who took down my statement did not actually quote what I said.  
Q.	Did you ever come to learn that there existed in Kivumu a security committee, composed of the bourgmestre, the IPJ and Seromba; yes or no?
A.	I think I have already provided explanations on the subject of this question.  I gave the names of the members of the security committee, and I also talked about the crisis committee, and I even talked to the IPJ from Kibuye.  I gave you the names of those people sitting on the crisis committee after the destruction of the church.  I can give you those names again.  I talked to you about Fulgence Kayishema, the IPJ; Joseph, the president of the canton; I talked about Ndahimana, and the former bourgmestre of the commune; and I said that the committee was comprised of conseiller who were representatives of the different political parties, notably, Ndungutse, who was the head of the MRND.  I talked to you about the president of the MRND and Rushema, Anastase.  So that's what I said.  I don't know whether this was faithfully noted down in my statement, but I never said to the investigator that Father Seromba was a member of the said committee.  
Q.	Thank you for that.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
With the help of the registry, and after circulating it, can the witness be shown what appears to be his 19 May 2000 statement to Rwandan authorities in Kibuye.  Copies have been given to the interpreters and the Defence.  I'll give out the references, Your Honours, while that is going around.  There's a Kinyarwanda handwritten, that's K0508371; a typed Kinyarwanda version K0508374; a French translation 0344943; and, finally, in English K0343186.  If the witness can look at the page that has been handed to him, which is the last page.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	If you can look at the last page please, Mr. Witness, and confirm is that your signature on the bottom left of the last page, yes or no? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, while the witness is looking at the document, I would like to know how many questions are outstanding for the witness, because if you have a number, I think that we should adjourn now because it is 5:33.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
I would crave the indulgence for about three or four minutes just to get the statements from this written statement, and then I have probably 15 to 20 questions and I know there is already going to be re-examination tomorrow.  I just -- if you're in a hurry, I understand, but I think it might be nice to just finish off this statement.  I just have two sentences.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I have a number of obligations due to -- security reminded me the time lapse in which I could bring the witness here, so we would like to remind the Chamber that there are time constraints as far as Father Seromba is concerned.  
JUDGE HÖKBORG:
Mr. Prosecutor, how long will your questions take?  I mean, we know that, maybe, the answers will be long from the witness, but would you have an estimate as to your questions in combination with what you might think that the witness would answer because we don't want to stay here more than, let's say, five minutes?  Do you think it could be done in that time?  Otherwise, I think we might want to leave.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
I have two quotations, four sentences to read.  I think it's less than five minutes, of this statement, and then I have another 20 minutes for tomorrow I would say.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, in view of the fact that your questions are going to have -- are going to reflect what you're going to read, I think that you should then read the excerpts tomorrow and ask your questions subsequently.  

We're going to adjourn now.  Good evening to everybody.  Court is adjourned. 
(Court adjourned at 1743H)
