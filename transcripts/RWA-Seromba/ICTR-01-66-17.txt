Cross-examination by Mr. Pognon.	3



P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session.  Mr. Witness, as we told you before, today it is the Defence counsel who will be cross-examining you.  We therefore invite you to listen to the questions keenly and provide very concise answers thereto.  So, Counsel Monthé, do you want to begin the cross-examination?  You have the floor.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President -- Your Honours, Madam President, I will proceed with this cross-examination, but I would like first of all to make a comment regarding procedure to your Chamber because you followed with me the examination-in-chief of this witness by the Prosecutor, and it so happens that from all the statements that we received, and in light of what we heard from this witness, it is quite something else. We are dealing with new statements, and this is in contravention or in violation of Rules 73(B) - (A), (B), and 4(B), (C), which states that the statements must be disclosed to the Defence so that everybody is aware of the statement.  So, Madam President, if we happen to go back to issues that have already been raised, Madam President shouldn't be surprised because the witness has made new statements, and I want this to be clear.  And that said, I will proceed with the cross-examination. Madam President, apparently the witness wants to take the floor. 

Yes, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
I have a problem, and I would like to tell you about it.  Today I realise that I have some worries.  I'm having some pain.  Yesterday the Defence Counsel asked me that -- or when he was going to begin his cross-examination, the time wasn't made clear, and you said this would be told us in due course.  I'm here like a prisoner, like a detained person.  The two parties are in front of this kettle.  And as far as I'm concerned, I do not know what I should expect. 

Let's say that the place where I'm accommodated, I am with strangers where nobody speaks my language, and when I have a problem, I don't know to whom I can express them because I don't speak their language.  Consequently, Madam President, Your Honours, given the circumstances under which I find myself, I have problems because I'm not informed.  I'm not briefed about the manner in which things are going on.  That is the first issue. 

Secondly, before the counsel starts putting questions to me, he has filed a motion to the effect that he did not accept the fact that I actually had injuries and that consequently a doctor should examine me and confirm if this were the case or not.  I do not know why he made that application, and that is why I would like to request from you, if he is going to cross-examine me, after having taken note of -- or establish the fact that I have these injuries or wounds. 

Third point that I want to raise is that the Father Athanase's counsel -- I do not know if you can reassure me if that counsel will not, in one way or the other, cause me to reveal my identity, and in the event that you reassure me in that regard, that he must take into account this aspect, you should tell me.  Otherwise I have some apprehensions. 

One last point -- I would like to crave indulgence for taking all this time.  I am not refusing to answer questions that will be put to me by him.  I'm only trying to expose some of the problems I have.  After my testimony, that is, after what I've been through with my testimony, I will wish that the Prosecutor and the Tribunal, as well as the representative of the victims in the Tribunal here in Arusha -- I would, therefore, to expose all the problems that I have to these persons.  That is what I wanted to say, to tell the Tribunal.  So we can proceed.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, here, you are at the disposal of the Chamber, but it is the Witness protection section that is responsible for addressing your problems and for briefing you on any matter.  And yesterday when we adjourned, we did not know if we were going to resume proceedings in the morning or only the afternoon.  Everyone was informed yesterday afternoon, and we were under the impression that you were also informed by the Witness protection section.  If you were not aware yesterday that you would only be appearing this afternoon, we are really very sorry for that. 

As for the problems that you are facing, you should address them to that same service -- I think they have interpreters who speak Kinyarwanda and who can therefore listen to your complaints -- and explain to them what you wish to be done.  In the event that you have any difficulties in that respect, you can always refer back to the Chamber. 

The counsel will tell you if he has the intention of questioning you only after having ascertained the existence of your wound.  I'm not quite sure, but I do not think that, to the best of my knowledge, you were expected to undergo any medical examination.  The idea here was that, while mention was made of your wound, you talked about your wound, but the Chamber did not deem it necessary to establish all the wounds outside the ones that we can see by your left eye.  As far as the Defence is concerned, they will tell you what they expect. 

Father Seromba cannot reveal your identity.  He is aware that you are a protected witness, and all those who are here cannot reveal your identity because they are forbidden to do so officially, and they know that they cannot breach that Rule of the Tribunal. 

Now, as concerns the questions that you'd like to forward to the Prosecutor or to the victims and witness support unit, you may do so.  And I think that once you would have been through with your cross-examination, you may once again get in touch with the Prosecutor and brief him on your problems.  But we have the officials of the victims and witness protection unit who is there to listen to you and to iron out any problems that you are facing.  I hope that I have answered your questions or that I have addressed your concerns.  

So, in the absence of any other issues, we can invite Counsel Monthé to start his cross-examination.
WITNESS CBJ
CROSS-EXAMINATION
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Mr. Witness, good afternoon.  Good afternoon, Counsel.  As Madam President told you, I'm going to put a number of questions to you, and I will invite you to kindly answer them.  If you don't know the answer, say you don't know.  I will go on to some other line of questioning, and if you don't quite understand the question, you can tell me so that I can rephrase it.  If or when you're ready, let me know. 
A.	You may proceed.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Mr. Witness, can you tell us in 1994 what was your occupation?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(No interpretation)
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I did not even mention the place.  In the end, I think we are going to conduct the entire in closed session.  I did not say the place.  His name was not known.  I merely asked what he was doing during that period.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We would like to draw your attention to the sensitive nature of that question vis-à-vis what can ensue.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Well, I'm not asking him details.  He can answer by yes or by no.  He can tell me, "I was working," or "I wasn't working," or something like that.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, you asked him what was his profession.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, Madam President.  I suppose that in that country of more than eight million people - Madam President, I did not follow.  Is the question valid?

MADAM PRESIDENT:
I see the Prosecutor who is on his feet.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Well, he's starting pretty early this afternoon.  At that rate, I don't think we will achieve anything.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Counsel is making an impressive start with asking questions which reveal his identity.  This same question appears on the protected information sheet.  Counsel has this information.  It's in the record; it's asked and answered in effect, and it reveals his identity.  If Counsel seeks to ask questions that will reveal his identity, he's welcome to do so in closed session.  I encourage him to do that.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I believe that I am going to proceed because this cross-examination may end up looking like a difficult childbirth. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, did you change professions many times?
A.	First of all, I will start with the previous question.  I know that you are rather cunning.  You asked a question whose answer would have been likely to reveal my identity.  You asked my -- you asked a question concerning my profession.  I do not suppose that you want to offer me a job here.  We're dealing with the Seromba trial.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, please.  I told you a while ago that you should answer the questions concisely and briefly.  Answer the questions briefly as to whether you have had to change professions.  Don't say what could reveal your identity.  You are the one who is talking, and yesterday, you, yourself, gave proof thereof.  So please try not to say anything that could reveal your identity, and try to be brief in your answers to the questions put to you as much as possible.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  Regarding your question as to whether I've had to change professions, I will answer in the affirmative.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Thank you.  Can you tell us how many times?
A.	Twice.
Q.	Thank you.  What was your religion at that time?
A.	I was a Catholic faithful.
Q.	Did you so remain?  Did you remain a faithful of the Catholic church?
A.	Yes, up until today.
Q.	You stated to us that you belonged to a (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal) movement.  Is that correct?

MR. TOWNSEND:
Objection.  Should be in closed session, Your Honour.  Move to strike.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
I realise that the Defence counsel for Father Seromba (unintelligible) are going to understand each other.  Even the first question he asked, you noted the meaning of that question.  At least you should respect my rights.  You stop him from doing something, and he goes ahead to do the same thing.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we advised you that if a question were asked that is likely to reveal your identity, you can tell him you cannot answer the question in open session because it may reveal your identity, just as you did yesterday.
THE WITNESS:
In any case, I'd like to ask you one thing.  Between Father Seromba's Defence counsel and myself, I mean, who is the man of law?  He is a person who knows the law.  I am not knowledgeable about the conditions surrounding -- on which are governing us.  He is the one who should abide by those conditions, not yours truly.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I think it would be more cautious for you to keep those questions and ask them in closed session; otherwise, we will not make any headway.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I do want that, but for one thing, we have people in the gallery.  I don't think we have to impose -- if we have to impose a closed session on them.  I mean, I asked him if he was (unintelligible); he said that's okay.  I asked him if he was on the (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal) movement.  I think he could have said yes.  Since there are people in the gallery, I think we should take advantage of their presence here.
MR. TOWNSEND.
(Microphone not activated) at this time, Your Honours, for reasons that relate to witness protection.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I believe that the Prosecutor is the Prosecutor, and I have a responsibility to defend.  I don't know what you ate today, but I don't think it is opportune yet to get into closed session.  When I will deem it necessary, I will apply for that.  I think I am mature enough for that.  Thank you, in any case, for your advice, Mr. Prosecutor.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(No interpretation)
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, do you think that at my age I would want anybody to be revealed?  We are working under difficult conditions, and this applies to everyone.  I am trying to do my work as faithfully as possible, and I'm striving to do just that.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, go ahead.
THE WITNESS:
I still have a problem.  I observe that that person is cunning.  He has already said it all.  What hasn't he said?  What should be my conduct before you?  He has said everything.  He doesn't want the proceedings to continue in closed session.  I would like you to recognise that right of his, but you should also uphold my rights.  Now he is talking about what the Prosecutor ate at midday.  Do you think he is right?  In fact, he is like Seromba.  There is no difference between the two of them.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Witness, be very careful as to what you say.  We ask this of all parties, and to you as well who are a witness for the Chamber.  We are all here to ensure that your identity is not revealed.  We therefore direct the registry to expunge the word (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal) from the records. Counsel, you may proceed to ask the witness questions that have no relation with his identity.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  But I'd like you to tell the witness to avoid using any qualifiers as far as I am concerned, or characterisation as far as he is concerned.  Madam President, the witness wants to speak.  Madam President, I would suggest that we adjourn for two minutes before we -- so that this problem should be sorted out.  There's a manifest obstruction.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, what is your problem?  We have already said that questions that could reveal your identity will not be put to you, and what could have posed a problem has been expunged from the records.  What is the problem now? 
THE WITNESS:
The problem is that he has just said that I am using characterisation when referring to him.  If I made an error by chance, please correct me and tell me what statements I made that were not decent because I wouldn't like that after the proceedings, it should be said that the witness made an error.  Tell me what I should say.  If I, perchance, committed an error, please point it out to me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, what we didn't accept was the fact that you stated that the counsel was like such and such a person.  Such characterisation was not proper.  That is what we did not appreciate.  So in future, please refrain from repeating such statements. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I thank you.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
So try, therefore, to answer the questions as concisely and as precisely as possible. 
Counsel Monthé, you have the floor.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, can you tell the Chamber when you learnt that killings had started in your commune?
A.	Could you please rephrase your question?  I didn't quite understand it.
Q.	Willingly.  What I'm asking you to do is to tell the Chamber on what date you heard that killings had started in your commune.
A.	First of all, there was the death of President Habyarimana.  I believe he died on the 6th, that is, the 6th of April 1994.  From that time, as a matter of fact, from the 7th of April 1994, massacres started in the rural areas in various locations. 
Q.	I thank you.  How did you come to know that massacres had started in the rural areas?
A.	As regards the circumstances under which I heard that, where I was, it was from the death of President Habyarimana that was on the 7th; people started throwing stones on our houses.  I am referring to ourselves who were of the Tutsi group.  And at night, we heard noises.  I do not remember very well.  It was between the 7th and the 9th, I believe.  Very close to my house, members of Ndakubana's family had been killed in Nyange secteur in Murambe cellule.  I remember it was the night of the 7th, and the person who killed them was a teacher called Telésphore Ndungutse.  As I pointed out before, between the 7th and the 9th, a man of Tutsi origin called Martin was an (unintelligible) extension officer.  He was from Ngobagoba secteur.  That person was killed during an attack launched by a businessman called Gaspard Kanyarukiga.  Other people were killed, whose names I cannot give.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When you state that they started throwing stones on roofs, are you referring to the roofs of your house or the roofs of everyone, everyone's house?
A.	I begin with myself.  It happened to me.  I believe it was on the 8th.  I was living close to a centre, and we heard noises at night.  All night, stones were thrown on our house, and even in the vicinity of our house, I could hear shouts at night and a lot of noise.
Q.	Thank you.  And when they started throwing stones on your roof, what did you do?
A.	You will excuse me, Counsel.  It is possible that I forgot to give a detail in the statements which I gave, and you should also note that I am not a machine.  As a matter of fact, it was from the 7th up to the 9th, the night -- in fact, during the day I was at home, but at least in the evening, I used to go and spend a night in the convent.
Q.	Please, Witness.  Listen to my questions and answer them.  I simply asked you what you did when stones were thrown on the roof of your house.  I have not asked for dates.  What did you do at that time?
A.	When stones were thrown on my house, I shouted "Help."
Q.	And where did you go?
A.	At that time I went to seek refuge in the convent.  It was myself, my wife, and my children.
Q.	Now, let us come to the date.  Do you remember on what day that was?
A.	You make reference to dates.  I haven't quite understood.  What dates -- for what dates you want me to give details?
Q.	Listen to my question carefully, please.  On what day did you leave your house accompanied by your wife and children to seek refuge in the convent?
A.	It was from the 7th -- as a matter of fact, it was during the night of the 7th, the 8th, and the 9th.  However, during the day, I was in my house.  It was, as a matter of fact, at night that we heard noises and shouts.
Q.	Now, if we understand what you're saying well, during the day you were in your house, and at night you slept in the convent. 
A.	Yes.
Q.	For how long did you live in this manner?  How many days?
A.	I did this for three nights.
Q.	After those three nights, where did you go?
A.	After those three nights, that was on the 10th.  It was a Sunday.  I realised that the situation was getting worse, and I went to seek refuge in the church. 
Q.	To which church did you go?
A.	It was Nyange parish church.
Q.	At what time did you arrive on that day of the 11th of April?
A.	I spoke of the 10th, and now you talk of the 11th, Counsel. 
Q.	Excuse me, I mean the 10th, please.  You arrived at the church on the 10th of April?
A.	It was very early in the morning. 
Q.	When you got there, were there people there?  Were there other people who were already there?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you give us an estimate of the number of people you found there?
A.	As for the number of people I found there, I will give you the circumstances under which I got the number.  At the time when I arrived at the scene, I found other Tutsis who had sought refuge in the parish.  And in the evening, Father Seromba asked the watchman called Canisius Habyiambere and the major seminarian, Hakizimana Appollinaire, to count the refugees who were going to spend the night there.  So Canisius came and counted the refugees and found that there were 48 of us.
Q.	So on the 10th of April, 1994, you arrived very early in the morning in the church, and there were 48 of you.  Is that what you are saying?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Excuse me, translators.  Those 48 people, were they of the same ethnic group as yourself?
A.	Yes, but I remember another detail.  There were businessmen, including a certain man called Jean Kayiranga, Miriam, his wife and their children.  There was another businessman called Damien, as well as other people who were quite well to do.  They had all sought refuge in the presbytere, and in the morning they could be seen. 
Q.	Thank you, sir.  Tell me, Witness, before you came here, the Prosecutor sent Prosecution investigators to meet you.  Did he send Prosecution investigators to meet you?
A.	I haven't quite understood your question.
Q.	Before you came to this Chamber to testify, you had the opportunity to give statements to investigators from the Office of the Prosecutor in Rwanda.  Is that right?
A.	I do not very well remember.
Q.	You never met anyone from the Office of the Prosecutor?
A.	I believe I was interviewed on several occasions.  I believe that even the Tribunal interviewed me, and as you can notice, you'd understand that I could not have come before this Chamber without giving a statement. 
Q.	You can see that it is easier to answer my questions that way.  Since you accept that you gave statements, I will go through the first statement that you gave. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, in the interests of the bench, we are dealing with the statement of the witness of 15 November 1995, and the number is the K-number is K0125033.  And I would like us to turn to K0125036, bottom of the page.  If the Chamber is ready, I would like to read it out, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have found it.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, I would like to read this statement.  At the end of the page, the question is asked this Witness CBJ, and the people asking the questions are investigators from the Office of the Prosecutor.  "Question:  When did you go to the church?  Answer:  On the 10th.  I went to the church to seek refuge there.  There were about 7,000 to 10,000 people inside the church.  There were about 7,000 to 10,000 people inside the church.  They were all Tutsi."  I don't deem it necessary at this point in my demonstration to read the rest of the passage. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, can you explain to the Chamber that from 7 to 10,000, you now talk of 48 today?
A.	I notice that the statement that you are attributing to me, that is, that I stated that on the 10th, the estimate I gave of the people at the church was 7 to 10,000.  I do not disagree with what you are stating -- I do not agree with what you are stating.
Q.	Witness, I have just read your statement and I wanted to know what you think of it.  If you have nothing to say, say so.  But there is an enormous discrepancy between 48 and 10,000.  That is what I wanted to point out.
MR. TOWNSEND:
At this point it becomes a misstatement of the written statement.  He's not saying that that figure is on that day.  It's two separate sentences.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Is it an objection? 
MR. TOWNSEND:
Yes.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I don't know whether it is an objection because I did not hear what the Prosecution said.  Prosecutor, I am reading a statement taken down by your investigators which you perhaps did not see.  Once more, you do not understand French.  I regret it, but it is clearly indicated that there were between 7,000 and 10,000 people, and there is enormous discrepancy between 7 to 10,000 and 48.  We can count in all languages, not only in French. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
Counsel maybe didn't understand my objection.  The second question was characterising that the witness in his written statement attributed that number to the date of the 10th of April.  And that connection which Counsel puts in his question does not exist in the statement and, as such, is misleading and not fair to the witness.  If you can explain it, we can allow the witness to explain, but it's not fair to say that the statement says that number was on the 10th.  Obviously, he said in his testimony the numbers increased daily.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think the Chamber will weigh the evidence.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, the Chamber will weigh the evidence, but -- we are here for that.  But when the truth is established and it is found in the document, this should be stated.  The Chamber will weigh the evidence; I am convinced of that.  But I am reading a statement of the Prosecution relating to the date of the 10th, and I want the Prosecutor to bear this in mind.  

Mr. Prosecutor, you should first of all read the document yourself before giving it to the Defence.  That is all.  We haven't come here for a joke.  We are here to defend our client.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Is there a question for the witness?
MR. MONTHÉ:
If you took your seat, Mr. Prosecutor, I would continue.  Thank you.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
We request the parties to remain calm so that we can make progress, please. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	On the 10th of April, Witness, what was the situation in the parish that morning? 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, the witness wants to speak again.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Don't ask me another question before I've answered the first question.  If there's a point that has not been clarified, we should tackle that point before proceeding.  I want to explain the situation on that question.  What I think you're trying to do is to set a trap for me.  I was interviewed by several people; more than 150 people put questions to me.  If I stated that on this Sunday, the 10th, who were between 7,000 and 10,000 in number, if I said -- I did not say so.  I remember saying something, but I don't know the persons to whom I gave my statement.  As far as I'm concerned, given the number of people who are present, I gave an estimate, and I stated that the people who were there were between 7,000 and 10,000 people.  That is what I stated.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	At least we are agreed on one thing.
A.	To state that, on the 10th, I estimated the number of people present at between 7,000 and 10,000, I would rather ask you to understand that the person who wrote down my statement may have made an error between what I stated and what he wrote down.  In saying that those people were present on that date, that is not what I stated.  As a matter of fact, it is not the Prosecution's fault either.  There was an error.  People may err in writing down statements in one language or the other.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I don't know if you're continuing to answer my question.
A.	Well, I would further request from you, Counsel, and I'm sorry -- I'm requesting from you that you show me, or the Tribunal show me the document so that I can see if it is my signature that is there.  Probably I made statements or probably there are statements that are being attributed to me.  Please show me the document so that I can verify to see if I appended my signature thereto or not.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We do not have the witness's signature on the document in French, nor do we have his signature in the English version.  Probably a signature is in the Kinyarwanda version.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I think a few days ago I raised this issue, and I was told that the statements were taken in one language and signed in that language, but that the other translations are not signed.  I think we still come up facing the same problems.  I raised this issue with the Prosecutor, and now the question is being referred to me.  If it is not signed, I don't think it's my fault.  I'm using it because I received it as a party to the trial.  Those who collected -- who took the statement should answer and tell which version is signed and which is not signed.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But, Counsel, we didn't ask that document from you.  We simply note that the document that we have does not bear the signature of the witness because the witness asked to be shown the document so that he can ascertain as to whether he's the one who signed the document or not.  You may carry on, Counsel.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	In your opinion, Mr. Witness, in 1994 in your commune, how many Tutsi were there?
A.	I am sorry, Counsel.  When I make an estimate -- it is not necessarily the reality if I make an estimate that were the Tutsis in my commune at the time.  I think there were more than 10,000 of them. 
Q.	Thank you.  Are you aware that the Prosecutor estimated them at 6,000 in his indictment, and you will see this in his indictment that is on page 112 thereof. 
A.	One can be mistaken.  I wasn't concerned with the census or population count of the Tutsi.  To say that I said there were about 6,000 of them, well, it is not an error, and that cannot exculpate Father Seromba.  The figure is not important, and the person who brought forward the figure cannot be punished.  If you want to know the number of Tutsi who were in the commune, please ask Father Seromba.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we are compelled to tell you once again to give brief answers, if I can express myself in this way.  Please don't go beyond the questions that are put to you.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	When you got to the church on that day, Mr. Witness, did anybody welcome you?  Did anybody receive you? 
A.	I would like to ask you, when you ask me to answer briefly, tell me first of all if the number of Tutsi that were in the commune or the question concerning the number of Tutsi in the commune has been answered.  Was that question useless?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No, we did not say that a question was not useful, Mr. Witness.  It is simply because of your answers, and that is why we are leaving it aside.  And this is better for you because you -- that is if you answer briefly to the questions that I asked. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Well, I think we will talk of this in other circles, Madam President. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Mr. Witness, let's come back to what we were dealing with.  Were you welcomed by the members of the parish when you got to the parish on the 10th of April, 1994?
A.	Welcoming me in which respect, Counsel? 
Q.	Well, I will rephrase my question.  When you arrived at the church, was there one of the clergy who was there to welcome you or to receive you?
A.	I did not quite understand what you mean by welcoming me.  Does welcoming me mean to give us food to eat or what?  I don't quite understand what you mean by to welcome.
Q.	When you arrived at the church, what did you do?  Where did you go?  Were you shown somewhere to go?
A.	Nobody showed me where to go.  When I arrived, I found the others.  Nobody gave me the permission to join them.  I probably should give you an example for you to better understand my answer.  Ask me the question in a different way.  Ask me, for instance: why did you not seek refuge elsewhere?  Why did you seek refuge at the church?  And I will tell you why we sought refuge at the church.
Q.	Please begin by answering the question very briefly and we will move on to another.  If you start extrapolating, we will not achieve anything. 
A.	Does this mean that you didn't want me to explain why I sought refuge at the church?  Why are you avoiding my explanation regarding that? 
Q.	That is not a question, Mr. Witness.  Probably it will come in due course.  I asked you, when you got to the church, did anybody show you where you could take refuge?  That is my question. 
A.	Nobody showed me where to go.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, the 48 persons or the 10,000 people who were there, where were they?
A.	I have asked you to stop coming back to the issue of 10,000 people.  And, besides, that question was not addressed.  Why are you coming back to the question regarding the 10,000 people?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Counsel.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	When you arrived on that day in the church, were there members of the clergy?
A.	As soon as I got to the church, Father Seromba was there.
Q.	Where was he?  At what position or location in the church or in the parish was he?
A.	Nobody had compelled him to stand at one spot.  He was moving from place to place in the presbytere and outside the presbytere.  I did not have orders to control him.
Q.	We seem to be speaking at cross purposes.  You arrived at the parish in the morning of the 10th and Father Seromba was there.  If he was there, where exactly was he?  That is my question. 
A.	You shouldn't pretend that you are ignorant.  I have explained what you asked for.  You want me to explain a thousand times?  Why do you insist on asking that question over and over?  If I have answered a question, accept that I have answered that question.  I have said that he was present and that he was moving from place to place.  Didn't you really understand?
Q.	Mr. Witness, on the 10th of April, that was a Sunday. 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Was there mass on that day?
A.	On that day, there was no mass.  Who was going to celebrate the mass while the situation was rather critical?
Q.	But when you arrived, you said there were 48 people.  Was the situation critical? 
A.	From the very beginning, I told you that people were found in the courtyard, and I told you that people were piercing others with sharp objects.  Now you're asking me if people went to church.  No, I didn't see that happen.
Q.	Mr. Witness, for now, you and I are not dealing with the parish -- with the killings yet.  We're not talking about the killings yet.  I asked you a question.  Please answer the question.  I asked you if there was a mass on that day.  You said no.  Now I asked you why. 
A.	If the Judge is hearing us, I do not know which way you want to go.  First of all, you asked me if I left my home where people were being killed, and I answered you that Ndungutse killed people and that Martin had just been assassinated.  Didn't you hear my answer to that question?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, I think I will have to adjourn for five minutes so that we can look into this problem.  So the proceedings are adjourned for five minutes.

	(Court resumed at 1534H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is now in session. 

Counsel Monthé, we are of the opinion that you can resume now. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, you said there was no mass on Sunday, the 10th of April; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	In your opinion, why was there no mass on that Sunday?
A.	It was because outside the parish there were disturbances, there were killings.
Q.	When you saw Father Seromba, you as a Christian, didn't you think it necessary to ask him why there was no mass on that Sunday?
A.	I didn't think about that.
Q.	Customarily, did you used to go to church to attend mass on Sunday?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And the other parishioners that were there, weren't they worried that there was no mass?
A.	I do not know.
Q.	What was Father Seromba doing on that Sunday when you saw him?
A.	I did not pay any particular attention to know what he was doing.  I didn't quite understand the question.  Something happened when we arrived.  When I arrived, I saw a trader called Jean Kayiranga.  I saw him bring a bag of rice and other things which were packaged; it was foodstuff.  That is what I saw on that day.
Q.	Mr. Witness, that is not the question I put to you.  That is not what I was expecting as an answer.  When you arrived in the church, where did you go?  Did you go to the parish, the presbytery, the office, or inside the church?  What did you do?
A.	I arrived during the day.  I moved about in the parish.  We spent the night in the building where catechism lessons were given.
Q.	Thank you.  But before you got to the night, try to say what happened each hour.  You arrived very early in the morning.  There were 48 refugees in the parish according to you.  There was Father Seromba -- were there any other clerics whom you were able to see on that day?
A.	On that day another person who was present was a major Semanarian, Appollinaire Hakizimana.
Q.	While you were there, who was the parish priest?
A.	The parish priest who was there -- even though I don't know everything regarding the priest, I would say that the only priest who was there was Father Seromba.
Q.	Do you know who a parish priest is?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you briefly tell the Chamber what the duties of a parish priest are?
A.	Yes.
Q.	We are listening to you.
A.	Normally, in the parish, there are two or three priests, but there is parish priest who coordinates the activities of the parish.  He is in charge of resolving the problems of the parish.  There are vicars who assist him in his activities.  This is my understanding of the duties of a parish priest.
Q.	That is very concise.  I thank you.  Tell us, did you hear of Father Straton?
A.	Yes.
Q.	What was his role in that parish?
A.	He was a parish priest.
Q.	Right.  When you got there, was he still there?
A.	No.
Q.	Was he replaced as parish priest?
A.	No.
Q.	So Father Seromba was therefore not parish priest?
A.	Yes.
Q.	I thank you.  Tell us, the day wore on; you were still in the parish.  Apart from the refugees, were there any other people?
A.	There were.
Q.	What categories of people were there?
A.	There were the cooks of the parish; there were the cattle rearers who are in charge of the priests' livestock; and other people who are in charge of other activities in the presbytery.
Q.	And were those people working at the time?
A.	Among the Tutsis, there were some people who were not working, who were together.  However, there was another person who was in charge of the livestock.
Q.	Thank you.  When you arrived on that morning, was the church open?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Were there people inside the church?
A.	No, there were no people inside the church.
Q.	Did you find gendarmes there?
A.	I don't very well remember.
Q.	Witness, I want us to turn to your statement.  It is the same statement I mentioned at the beginning of my cross-examination, that of, 15th of November 1995, and it's K0125037. 

Question: "Could you freely go into the church and come out of it while it was guarded?" 

Answer: "There were six gendarmes around the church.  At the beginning we could go and come as we liked.  The gendarmes said they were protecting us.  No one wanted to go out because outside the church there were many killings."  

So my question is as follows, Witness: did you see gendarmes on that day, yes or no?
A.	One may forget.  I tried to rectify what I say somewhere.  I did not find six gendarmes.  I had erred and I explained it; there were only three gendarmes.
Q.	The question has not to do with numbers, Witness.  Did you find gendarmes there, yes or no?  You're answer was no.
A.	I remember there were gendarmes.
Q.	I thank you.  When you left your home and passed through the convent to get to the church, were there already roadblocks on the roads?
A.	Roadblocks had not yet been erected.
Q.	So peace -- there was still peace in the area?
A.	Yes, people could move about.
Q.	I thank you.  At the end of the day of the 10th of April, were there still only 48 of you, if we remain with the figure you indicated today?
A.	There were 48 of us.
Q.	Did you sleep that night inside the church or elsewhere in the parish?
A.	We slept in the catechism school near the CARITAS store.
Q.	Was it all 48 of you, or you alone?
A.	We all slept there.
Q.	Did one of the clerics prevent you from sleeping there that evening?
A.	No.
Q.	I thank you.  The following day -- we're now on the 11th of April -- what happened?
A.	I do not quite understand the question you're putting to me, Counsel.
Q.	I'll repeat it if you wish.  You slept in the catechism room on the 10th of April.  You got up on the 11th in the morning; agreed?
A.	Yes.
Q.	What happened on the morning of the 11th of April, in the morning of the 11th of April?
A.	We went out.  We went for a walk outside without any problem.
Q.	Were there people around the premises on the 11th of April?
A.	Are you referring to the church premises? 
Q.	I'm referring to the vicinity of the church, the area outside the church.  Were there any other people apart from the six gendarmes you made mention of?
A.	Apart from the refugees and the gendarmes, there weren't any other people.
Q.	I thank you.  When you went for a walk, were there any clerics in the parish on the 11th?
A.	Yes, there were reverend sisters.
Q.	Did you know them?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you give us some names?
A.	Yes.
Q.	I am listening to you.
A.	There was Mama Yohana.  The second person was Mama Paula.  The third was Sister Assumpta.  The fourth was Sister Emerit (phonetic).  There was another Sister with a light complexion.  I do not remember her name.
Q.	Did you know Sister Mama Jean?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did you see her there on that day?
A.	Yes.
Q.	What was she doing there in the parish?
A.	Sister Jean came to us to see us.  I knew her -- we knew each other very well.  She tried to reassure us and she told us to have courage.  She also asked us whether we had any food in the vicinity. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did Sister Mama Jean bring any food to you?
A.	Sister Jean brought food to me in a bucket on two occasions.
Q.	Did you not know that that food was from the CARITAS stock of food sent by the clerics?
A.	I understood why.  I got to know later.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Could the translator repeat the answer because I didn't hear it. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I understood the reason why.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Do I understand that he understood that it came from the CARITAS stocks?
A.	I understood that there were members ***************************** who were in the village who had sent that food to their colleagues, that is, those of us who had sought refuge there.  At the bottom of the bucket was a sheet of paper on which was mentioned that it was members of our Hutu group that had sent us that food. 
Q.	We admit, you and I, that you, indeed, received food there?
A.	Yes, from Sister Jean.
Q.	I thank you.  These clerics, particularly Father Seromba, refused that Sister Jean should bring food to you?
A.	Let me go back.  I would like to say that that food was not for everyone.  It was meant for four people; it was not for everyone.  The question that you're putting to me -- whether Father Seromba prevented Sister Jean from bringing food to us, I did not witness that.  Furthermore, he did not know that food had been brought to us to that area.
Q.	Witness, you're not answering my question.  I asked you whether Father Seromba prevented Sister Jean from bringing food to you.  You should say yes or no. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I believe he has answered the question.  He said he did not witness that.
MR. MONTHÉ:
But that he did not know. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Be that as it may, to complete your answer to my question, how can you assert that Father Seromba was not aware that food had been brought to you?
A.	I believe I cannot answer that question whether or not he knew.  I am not aware of that. 
Q.	Thank you.  Tell me, on that day, did you see any assailants arrive?
A.	On the 11th?  Are you referring to the 11th?
Q.	We are still talking of the 11th, Witness.
A.	There was no attack on the 11th. 
Q.	Did you see a man called Ndungutse arrive on that day of the 11th?
A.	No.
Q.	When, in your opinion, did the killings at the parish effectively start?
A.	The killings started on the 15th.  The killings started on the 15th. 
Q.	Thank you.  And for how long did they last?
A.	The killings started after 10 a.m. and it continued up to 4 p.m., and even 5 p.m. those killings were still going on.
Q.	The killings were still going on on the 15th.  But on what day did they end?  That is my question.
A.	The killings started on the 15th and ended on the 16th at night.
Q.	Were you still at the parish when the killings ended on the 16th in the evening?
A.	Yes.
Q.	In your opinion, who ordered those killings?
A.	They were ordered by bourgmestre Grégoire Ndahimana; there was also a judicial police inspector, Kayeshema; there was Gaspard Kanyarukiga; the deputy bourgmestre, Anastase Rushema; the (unintelligible) court judge, Habiyambere, also known as Gacha Buthelezi; Father Athanase Seromba; the brigadier, Christophe Mbakirirehe, and many others whose names I cannot give here. 
Q.	I thank you.  Tell me, under what circumstances did the bourgmestre, in your opinion, order those killings?  Do you know?
A.	Yes, I know the circumstances under which those killings were ordered by him.
Q.	Could you please briefly relay those circumstances to us?
A.	I am relying on meetings that were held before the killings.  Those regular meetings which were held by the authorities -- the calls made to the villagers calling people to come and assist Kanyarukiga.  I also rely on the fact that I saw him supervising the killings on every occasion.  Furthermore, he was the bourgmestre of Kivumu commune.  He was the bourgmestre of that commune.
Q.	To enable us to enlighten the Chamber, let us come back to the notion of meeting.  You said a while ago that you relied on meetings.  Did you, indeed, know that meetings were held, or did you participate in those meetings, or you simply heard about them?
A.	No, I never participated in any of those meetings and nobody told me of them.  However, I could observe what was happening.  I had eyes to observe.
Q.	I thank you.  Witness, do you have a good memory?
A.	Indeed.  Before I began giving evidence, I forgot to mention this: I forget, particularly, dates because I told you of my disability, my problem of disability.
Q.	I thank you.  And I reassure you I don't want to talk to you about dates.  I, myself, don't like dates so, you see, we are the same.  But I will read your statement on which we are currently working with the Tribunal, that of the 15th of November 1995. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, it is the last page and it is K0125039.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	The prosecution investigator who invited you to come before this Chamber today asked you this question: "Do you know anything regarding meetings with the bourgmestre?"
MR. MONTHÉ:
I don't know whether the Bench has found it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. MONTHÉ:
I thank you. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	I was putting this question to the witness.  The investigator asks you: "Do you know anything regarding meetings with the bourgmestre?", and your answer was no.  Can you explain why?
MR. TOWNSEND:
Your Honours, I'm going to object, if I can, briefly.  I think it is linguistic.  The original of that statement is in English, and it is handwritten, and it bears the signatures, and it's -- that question appears on the page K0023226 disclosed to the Defence.  And the question is posed in the English bourgmestres, plural.  

"Do you know about a meeting or meetings with the bourgmestres?"

Answer: "No."

So the fact is that the question is a little bit different than the original and would have a completely different connotation.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I believe that the Prosecutor is going to embarrass the translation and language section because they are people who work with lots of dedication and whose devotion cannot be challenged.  I don't quite see what the difference is.  "Do you know about a meeting with the bourgmestre?", and he says "No".  If you're referring to the same page.  So what is your objection?  What are we talking about? 

The Presiding Judge -- furthermore, it is singular or plural.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
As far as I'm concerned I don't see any difference. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  The only difference I see is these interruptions that come all the time and which do disrupt my line of questioning and my reasoning.  

Mr. Prosecutor, can you sit down please?  Please, warm your seat.  But, Madam President, this is unbelievable. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you want to take the floor, Mr. Prosecutor?  No.  Well, apparently he didn't have the intention of taking the floor, so you may proceed, Counsel Monthé. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I think it shouldn't be a foolish game because we won't be able to find our way here. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell us why there is this discrepancy, this contradiction?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
I have the same objection and the objection is quite clear.  The witness in his witness statement gave a response to the question about bourgmestres plural, which is a meeting of several commune bourgmestres.  That's not alleged in the indictment and it's never been led in the evidence, and for him to allege there's now a discrepancy saying you never talked about a bourgmestres meeting and saying he never mentioned any -- a meeting with a bourgmestre are two different things.  So, as such, he misleads the Chamber and misleads the witness to believe that he never talked about a meeting with a bourgmestre. 

MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I thought we had disposed of that issue under your direction, which is Anglo-Saxon in nature.  Probably we may be accused of having a limitation since of -- in English.  I thought the issue had been disposed of.  This is taking us backwards.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
There is a small problem.  Madam Judge, here, will enlighten us. 
JUDGE HÖKBORG:
On page K0023233, at the very bottom, it is typed, "Do you know about" and in brackets "a meeting" -- in brackets "S" -- "with the bourgmestres", and I think that is what the Prosecutor is referring to having already referred to the handwritten. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I will not reply to the honourable judge, but I think we are dealing with a specific commune.  It is said that the bourgmestre engaged operations and the witness is asked if he knew about the meeting with the bourgmestre.  Probably, this concerns bourgmestres of different communes, but we're dealing with a specific commune.  We are not talking about an entire country; we're talking about a specific commune. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
And that's why the question put to the witness in the statement by the investigators was floored and revealed an answer which didn't illuminate us here. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
But were there many meetings of bourgmestres in that commune?  How many bourgmestres do we have in each commune in Rwanda at that time?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are going to listen to the witness's answer.  Yes, Mr. Witness, what do you want to tell us in that respect?
THE WITNESS:
I'd like to recall or remind the Prosecutor that during the testimony that I gave, during the statement that I made, at a certain point the witnesses came back to question me and would read the statement to me, and would ask if the statement was true.  I corrected certain points in my statement, but with regard to this specific point, I was asked if I knew what was discussed during those meetings and that is where I said no.  I, therefore, never said that I never knew that meetings were held but, rather, I answered that I did not know the purpose of the discussions of the participants during such meetings.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, so you see we're dealing with our hypothesis.  It's not a meeting of bourgmestres; it concerns a meeting in his commune.  Whatever the case, I note for purposes of the record that he stated on the 15th of November 1995 that he was not aware whether the meetings were being held or not, and that is what is here. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, your summary is not exactly what the witness has said.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Well, I stand corrected. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness said -- he said no in answer to the question as to what he knew concerning -- what was said in the meeting.
MR. MONTHÉ:
I think he's modifying or amending once again what he has already said.  In any case, Madam, we'll be coming up with new things.  By the time we finish this cross-examination, we'll come up with new elements at every turn.  It is a (French spoken) in a (French spoken) gallery.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	So tell me, did the bourgmestre order the killings?  How and to whom did he give the instructions?
A.	I said that he ordered the killings because when all those killings were taking place in his commune, he did nothing to stop them.  Furthermore, throughout the attacks, the bourgmestre stood apart, and during meetings he used to distinguish himself during the meetings.  In addition, he shot at us during the attack.  So I am saying that as the authority of the commune, instead of stopping the massacres, he was the one who was ordering them and supervising them.  My conclusion, therefore, follows that he was the supervisor; he was the one supervising the killings in conjunction with others as well.  And I believe that no other person, apart from himself, could have stopped those killings.  For instance, in the parish the -- while at the parish -- the parish or the father -- the priest had the authority to stop the killings.
Q.	Well, let's just stick to the bourgmestre.  We'll talk about the priest later.  Now, what are the powers of the bourgmestre in your commune in your opinion?
A.	The authority of the bourgmestre is limited to the boundaries of his commune.  He is responsible for the security of his population.  He's responsible.  He can prevent an unfortunate event, just as he can incite it.  If he wants, he can stop that event, just as he can encourage it to happen.
Q.	Thank you.  If I understand you well, the bourgmestre could, on that day, could have been able to prevent the events that took place in your commune from happening?
A.	Yes, you are correct.
Q.	Thank you.  How could he have gone about it in your opinion?
A.	He had communal policemen.  He had the judicial police inspector who was the supervisor of those policemen.  What this means is that if in a secteur or in any locality whatsoever, there are problems, the bourgmestre was supposed to bring assistance there.  And if he thought he was unable to do so, he could ask for reinforcement from the préfecture. 
Q.	Thank you.  Was the parish under the jurisdiction or territory of the commune?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Which means that the bourgmestre also had to ensure security in the parish?
A.	Yes.
Q.	So what could you blame Father Seromba of since he wasn't in charge of security?
A.	What I am reproaching Father Seromba of is that he was also responsible for the security of his faithful within the Nyange parish which was in the Kivumu commune.  In other words, if he saw that there wasn't security in his parish, especially in the presbytery, he ought to have informed the commune so the commune can bring him assistance.  So the parish was now under the responsibility of the bourgmestre -- or, rather, the bourgmestre was responsible for security, (unintelligible) as well, but what I reproach Father Seromba of is that in his parish, he was somewhat like the bourgmestre because he was the coordinator of all activities at the parish.  So even if the bourgmestre comes to attack him, he ought to have defended himself.  Even if he didn't have weapons, he could have been able to defend himself by his words, by his statements.  He should have been firm in the statements he made.  What I blame him of is of -- is that he connived or he collaborated with the bourgmestre in everything.  This priest, therefore, did not put up any resistance.  He did not defend himself or the parish vigorously.  On the contrary, he collaborated with the bourgmestre. 
Q.	Thank you.  Please try to be as brief as possible so we can get a headway.  You told us at the beginning of this cross-examination that you found gendarmes at the parish; is that correct?  Well, it is said that there was six, but you said there were three, and we agreed on that three?
A.	Yes, I rectified -- I corrected the number and said there were three gendarmes.
Q.	Are the gendarmes responsible for security in your country?
A.	Yes, I agree with you.
Q.	And under whose authority are the gendarmes placed?
A.	The gendarmes have their own line of superiors or authorities.  I don't know the person who is in the general staff, but I know that the supervisor was Colonel Nzapfakumunsi.
Q.	Thank you very much.  Now, tell me, regarding that issue, were those in charge of parishes -- did those in charge of parishes also have administrative responsibilities in your communes in your country in Rwanda?
A.	Please, can you repeat your question, Counsel?
Q.	I want to know if in Rwanda at that time if priests were vested with administrative prerogatives or responsibilities in the administration of the communes.
A.	The priests were responsible for parishes and schools.
Q.	So they didn't have any communal responsibilities?
A.	I would say that as the person in charge of the parish, they participated at all meetings that were held in the communes.
Q.	Well, that was not my question.  Did they have responsibilities insofar as that the organisation of the commune is concerned?  That was the meaning of my question.
A.	I did not know what responsibilities you are referring too, but I would say that they had the duty or the responsibility to manage the parish as well as schools.  I don't know if I quite understood your question.
Q.	Well, your answer is satisfactory to me.  Tell me, in Rwanda do priests give orders to gendarmes?
A.	No.
Q.	Thank you.  Consequently, we agree in saying that Father Seromba could not give any instructions to the gendarmes who were there?
A.	No, I don't agree with you.  I have something to add. 
Q.	I am listening to you.
A.	As the person in charge of the parish, the priest had the right to refuse anyone whatsoever.  Be it the gendarmes or a civilian should come and disrupt security in the parish.  If that were the case, he should have called on the higher authorities.
Q.	Thank you.  When, according to you, you are confronting gendarmes, don't they embody the forces of law and order?
A.	That would depend on the manner in which those gendarmes came to your place.
Q.	My question is simple: do gendarmes embody the public authority?
A.	Yes, I agree with you there.
Q.	Fine.  When the gendarmes issue an injunction to you, you as a citizen, do you obey them, or don't you?
A.	No, I cannot obey them.  If they show me something positive to do, I will agree, but if I have to do something negative, for instance, to disrupt the security of the population, I definitely wouldn't go along with them.  Even if I'm here before the Tribunal and that I'm told things I don't agree with, I wouldn't say yes if I'm not in agreement with it.
Q.	Now, tell me, Witness, the gendarmes that you saw there, were they armed?
A.	Yes, they were armed.
Q.	According to you, what could Father Seromba have done to oppose the gendarmes who were armed?
A.	There is something that Father Seromba ought to have done. 
Q.	Did you quite understand my question?
A.	Yes.
Q.	So I'm waiting for your answer.
A.	You're asking me what Father Seromba could have done before these gendarmes who were armed.  I am also wondering -- I could also ask, what did he do by deeds or words to stop those gendarmes from committing the acts they did?  Why did he collaborate with them from the beginning right up to the end to the extent of destroying the church?
Q.	Let's not jump the gun.  We'll come to that.  Now, explain this to me -- are you following me?
A.	Yes, I'm following you.
Q.	So things are working.  Now, explain this to me: why, of all the persons who were at the parish, is it that according to you that Father Seromba should have stood up against the gendarmes?
A.	Can you repeat your question, Counsel? 
Q.	Willingly.  My question is: why, according to you, of all the people who were at the parish, only Father Seromba ought to have been opposed to the gendarmes, whereas, you and I do agree that he wasn't the parish priest?
A.	I understand your question, Counsel.  The reality is that the priest in question didn't need to oppose people who were executing their criminal plan, but he should have known why they had come to the location.  Even if he didn't ask questions to the gendarmes -- for starters, those people couldn't have come without informing the bourgmestre, that is, they had come to the commune under his orders.  There is another point.  

The gendarmes did not go and take positions in the communal office, rather, they came to Father Seromba's premises and he noticed this.  He noticed their dangerous acts.  He did not put up any protest; rather, he collaborated with them in everything, which shows that he was conniving with them in implementing their scheme.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, the witness is asking for the floor. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness, we are listening to you. 
THE WITNESS:
Indeed, I would like to relieve myself a little bit.  That's all I am asking for. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are going to take a brief recess.  Ten minutes; is that okay?  So we'll take a brief recess of ten minutes.  So the Court stands adjourned for ten minutes. 
(Court recessed from 1634H to 1650H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is now in session. 

Counsel Monthé, you have the floor. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, I was telling you that in the face of the gendarmes who were present in the parish, the bourgmestre, the communal police officers, the judicial police inspector, what could Father Seromba and the other clerics have done to prevent the tragedy that had occurred?
A.	I will ask you to be patient and I will give you an example.  If you are satisfied with that, let me know to proceed or not. 
Q.	It is up to the Chamber to say so.  I put a question to you, and I'm expecting an answer.  If the example could enlighten us, I don't see why I shouldn't allow it. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
You are a family head.  You have a wife and children.  You are attacked by armed soldiers, or let's say simply bandits, but let us take the example of soldiers instead.  They attack you, they assault you.  The first thing you ask is why are they launching this attack?  And now that you're attacked, you ask for help, you request assistance.  You may not obtain it, but you will not keep silent in any case.  And if they say they're coming to kill someone, and you're not a target, and you cooperate with them -- in the final analysis, what will be the difference between you and the soldiers if you cooperate with them to kill someone?
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	I suppose that is your example.  Now, what is the answer to my question after your example?
A.	So the answer I would give you is that Father Seromba could have asked for help from these superiors.  As for us, his Christians, he could have told us that he had done everything, and it would have been evident to us, and we would have drawn the conclusion, but that was not done. 
Q.	I thank you.  When you refer to superiors, which authorities are you referring to -- I mean, authorities that Father Seromba could have contacted that that time?
A.	There was, first of all, the state -- the préfectural authorities.  Even had a phone at his disposal.  He could have sought help of the bishop to inform him that he had been attacked.  Perhaps some forces would have been sent from the bishop's house or from the préfectural authorities.  We would have noticed if he made a gesture in that direction.  But the priest and colleagues may have refused that people be killed and -- be killed, but he did nothing.  He, instead, cooperated with them. 
Q.	I thank you.  When you make mention of the (unintelligible) authorities and the bishop, does the bishop have an army?
A.	That is a very good question.  Don't you think the bishop and even the priest should be protected by the authorities in the area?  Do you think the persons I have just mentioned could have been attacked without the authorities doing anything whatsoever?
Q.	Tell me, Witness, at that time, the president of the republic had died, isn't it?
A.	Yes, I agree with you.
Q.	How was the state functioning?
A.	At that time, the state was functioning badly.
Q.	After Habyarimana's death, did you know that the bishop of that diocese was in prison at that time in Gisenyi?
A.	I didn't know that.
Q.	I am informing you of that.  You stated that the killings started on the 15th of April; is that right?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	I thank you.  In your opinion, how did those killings start?
A.	Are you referring to the killings that occurred on the 15th, Counsel? 
Q.	The 15th of April, as a matter of fact.
A.	Without complicating the situation, we were here yesterday.  I spoke at length about events on the 15th of April.  If you want me to go through them again, you would have to give me time to talk about those events again.
Q.	Witness, you spoke to the Prosecutor.  We don't have the same type of questions.  I would like you to enlighten me.  On the 15th of April, were there any killings?  How did it start?  Who gave the orders?  And how did they go on?  You can tell me briefly.  I don't need a long narrative.  Tell me whether they were organised groups.  Who commanded them?  Were they organised, and so on and so forth?
A.	I thank you very much.  Regarding who commanded more than 50,000 assailants, whereas, you are a target.  It's very difficult to know.  However, I made mention of Grégoire Ndahimana, Kayeshema, the police inspector, and many other people I mentioned.  The leaders of the killings, I named them.  They continued leading the assailants that killed us on the 15th, and even those who killed us on the 16th, nothing changed.  As for the rest of it all, all the assailants were acting as they wished.  As a matter of fact, at a certain time, the assailants attacked from all directions.
(Pages 15 to 28 by Roxane Lane)





















1700H
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	You stated that there were 50,000 assailants.  Who gave you that figure?
A.	Let us understand something.  That is only an estimate.  I never asserted that I counted those assailants.  What I gave is the figure -- what I think is the figure I gave.
Q.	Witness, did you often go to football stadiums?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Have you ever been to a stadium that can seat 50,000 people?
A.	No.
Q.	Did you ever go to Amahoro stadium in Kigali?
A.	No.
Q.	So I'll tell that you the figure of 50,000 is impossible because I have before me the Prosecution's indictment which states that, "At that time, the number of Hutu in the commune was to the tune of close to 50,000".  If I understand properly, the assailants were Hutu; isn't that correct?
A.	Please rephrase your question.  I didn't quite understand.
Q.	You say 50,000 people; the ones you mentioned was an estimate, and I tell you it is impossible because the Prosecutor states on page 112 of the indictment that number of Hutu in the commune was close to 50,000.  If you saw 50,000 assailants, that supposes, in my humble opinion, that no Hutus died during that period, that there were newborns that were added and old men also took -- also besieged the church; is that correct?
A.	Yes, I'm listening to you. 
Q.	Should we retain the 50,000 or do we take it that you erred, you are wrong?
A.	There is a point that needs to be clarified.  I confirm that I agree that I stated that the population of the commune could be to the tune of 50,000 people; however, as regards the assailants, I pointed out that there were more than 50,000 assailants.  There's another point which you are perhaps not aware of.  It was not only members of the Kivumu population who came to kill us.  Some assailants came from Kibirira commune.  Attacks were launched from Rusiro commune, and you would understand that the assailants came from three communes.  They did not come only from Kivumu commune.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Tell me: who were those giving orders to the assailants, or who was the person commanding the assailants?
A.	I am telling you that I mentioned the officials who held meetings at the time of the attacks and of the killings.  They led groups of killers, but it would be difficult for me to tell you who was commanding 50,000 assailants.  You, yourself, would understand that I cannot answer that question.  You, yourself, I don't think you can answer such a question.
Q.	Thank you.  So if I understood well, the 50,000 assailants did not have a leader.
A.	No, that is not what I said.  I have given the names of leaders, the authorities, and I have told you there were even some others that I did not know.  Accordingly, when the killings began they split into groups, but nobody gave me a report as to who was leading this or that group.  The truth be told, the people I named to you are the people I saw on the spot, and there are many things that were done at that location.  But I cannot give you everything -- a list of all the things that were done.  All I know is that they split into groups when they had to kill us.
Q.	Amongst the 50,000 people who were at the parish when the meetings were being held, amongst the assailants, how could you identify them amongst so many people; I mean, the 50,000 of them, all told?
A.	Let's go back a little.  Let us try to draw a distinction between meetings and the figure of 50,000 assailants.  In order to better answer your question, I would say that there had been meetings; there had been, you know, some organisation, and later people were called.  At a certain point in time, they swelled in numbers and during the attacks there were very many of them.  I don't know if I've answered your question, Counsel.
Q.	Well, I would like to know what organisation you are referring to.  Who was the one coordinating the organisation?  What organisation are you actually referring to?
A.	I explained to you by saying that, during the attack and the killings of the 15th, the assailants split into groups.  There was a group of assailants that came from the Nyange centre and there was another team that came from the Rukiga region in the Rukoko locality.  There was another team that came from the Kivumu commune.  They surrounded the church in the manner in which I have described to you and also talked about the time when the gendarmes shot in the air, and it is at that point that the assailants rushed towards us.  Consequently, therefore, it would be difficult for me -- for instance, if we had to talk in military terms, there is a battalion that could number 1,000 people.  Probably what you want to know is who is the leader of ten persons, of 100 persons.  There could be a leader -- or a ringleader of 150 persons, for instance, and that it is noted that this or that person is a leader.  As for the assailants, that is not how things happened because the idea was to come and bring assistance to Kanyarukiga, and they cooperated to attack us together.  I cannot tell you that Kayishema had this or that number of persons under his command, or that Seromba had this or that number of persons under his orders.  I cannot tell you that.  Please understand that.
Q.	Thank you.  That is some statement for a mere question.  Now, Witness, tell me: you told the Chamber that the assailants came from various secteurs and even from various communes; did they know each other?
A.	Are you doing this deliberately?  People who live in the same commune meet in the same markets; they meet in church; they meet in meetings organised by the bourgmestre.  But can't you understand that the answer is inherent in your question?  I mean, of course, the people knew each other.  And, besides, to show you that they you knew each other, they were informed of the common plan, of the same plan, according to which the enemies of the Hutu were the Tutsi.  So we are talking about a pre-established plan here.
Q.	Mr. Witness, how do you know that these people had a pre-established plan?  You didn't take part in any meeting.  You, yourself, you said they came from different communes.  How did you know that they had the same plan?
A.	I'm going to give you an example here in this courtroom.
Q.	Well.  I don't want an example.  Answer the question.
A.	Please, can you rephrase your question, Counsel?
Q.	I think we should agree on one thing.  Let's not go into examples.  Address the questions.  How could you know that these assailants had a pre-established plan, whereas you, yourself, stated that they came from various communes, various secteurs, and that they met in church and that they split up into groups?
A.	What makes me say so, that there was a pre-established plan is -- well, I will start with the date of 14 April.  We were confined in the church.  We were confined by the authorities I mentioned, including Father Seromba.  And after having confined us in that church, they held a meeting.  And what ensued from that meeting is the fact that the next day they killed us.  What else did I need to know that was the outcome of the meeting?
Q.	If I follow you well, it is at the end of the meeting.
A.	I'm sorry.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
(No interpretation)
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Kinyarwanda Interpreter.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	I'll go over my question again.   If I get you well, according to you, it was after the so-called meeting that the decision was taken to confine you in the church; that is, the notorious authorities.
A.	No, that is not what I said.  Before holding the meeting in question they had already confined us or locked us up in the church.
Q.	Thank you; I stand corrected.  So, the authorities locked you up in the church on the night of 14 to 15?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Thank you.  When they locked you up they then held a meeting, after having locked you up?
A.	Yes.
Q.	What was said at that meeting?
A.	I was not present at the meeting.  I was invited to it.
Q.	Yes, but you draw the conclusion that you were confined in the church in order to hold a meeting and that, according to your conclusions, that meeting had to do with your fate.
A.	No, that is not what I said.  If I said so, that would suppose that I was present at the meeting, but I have told you -- and I have never told you that I was present at that meeting.
Q.	Fine.  So I will rephrase my question so that we can understand each other well.  If I'm mistaken, please stop me.  Okay?
A.	Very good.
Q.	During the night of 14 to 15 April you were locked up in the church; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And after having locked you up, a meeting was held; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	At that meeting the subject matter was the refugees; is that correct?
A.	I told you that I was not at the meeting.  But I saw that -- when the meeting was in progress, I was observing what was being done with my own eyes.
Q.	Where were you, therefore, to be able to observe what was happening at the meeting?
A.	I would like to request for leave not to answer that question because that subject was dealt with at the beginning of the hearing.
Q.	Well, don't tell us where you were, but you were seeing clearly the participants at the meeting, you were seeing them from where you were.
A.	Unless I repeat this to you a thousand times, probably you can give me the time, but I have hold you that I saw them and I wasn't mistaken as to the identity of the various persons.
Q.	Fine.  Were you hearing what they were saying during that meeting?
A.	No.
Q.	Now, what, therefore, was the decision taken at the end of the meeting?
A.	What was decided was witnessed in the morning of the 15th of April; that's the 15th of April 1994.  That is, the idea was to kill us.  One other thing that I can tell you about this meeting and which led me to understand that the subject matter was the killing of us, is that, after having locked us up, they knew that they were going to kill us on the 15th.   Father Seromba knew about this.  He didn't have any pity on us, the Tutsi who had come to seek refuge; rather, he came and collected the cassocks and the other sacred implements.  And, from what I saw, I deduced that the idea was to kill us, that the meeting concerned the fact that they were going to kill us.
Q.	Thank you.  But even there -- I think, even there, you are talking quite a bit.  Well, you said you deduced that at the end of the meeting you were going to be killed since on the next day the killings began.
A.	In fact, it is not only that attack that made me think so; it is, rather, the fact that Father Seromba took the initiative to come and receive -- or collect the chalices, the vestments of the priests.  If he knew that they were going to be killed -- and he thought it was advisable to come and collect the chalices and the other priestly vestments.  Those are the acts, to which you should add the fact that they decided to kill us the next day.
Q.	Thank you.  I'm trying to understand.  That is why I'm not going as fast as yourself so, please, I crave your indulgence for that.  So you were confined inside the church.  Who locked you up?
A.	I will start from the very beginning.  It is Father Seromba who locked us up in that church, but the people who asked us to get into the church were the authorities who led the killings of Kivumu.  In any case, Father Seromba was with them and, as for the fact of locking us up proper, it is Father Seromba who did so.  He is the one who was holding the keys of the church.  He was the one who was responsible for the church at that point in time.
Q.	According to you, were you inside the church that evening?
A.	On the 14th of April 1994 when we were locked up inside the church I was in there.
Q.	But since you were in there, are the doors of that church locked from the inside or the outside?
A.	Thank you very much for the question.  The door that was locked by Father Seromba who had a lock -- but I would like to remind you that there were about ten doors.  There is a tool shutter door; there is a plank that served as a chain -- or a latch inside, and it was easy to open it.  But since it was an order that was issued we needed to -- we had to obey them.  We were asked to get inside the church and, finally, the priest locked the church with a lock.  He locked the door with a lock, as I said; otherwise, there was a latch inside the door.
Q.	Mr. Witness, no later than yesterday in this very courtroom you said the assailants followed you right up to the church and that you locked yourself inside, not that you were locked inside.  You probably have lapses in memory but, in just a few hours, I think it becomes difficult to forget what you said yesterday.
A.	There was something false in what you are saying in my regard, Counsel.  What you are saying there concerns the day of the 15th when the assailants had launched their attack against us.  What we have -- what I have just said did take place, indeed; but that concerns, rather, the day of the 15th when we were attacked with the grenades and we ran into the church and locked ourselves in there, and that has to do with the day of the 15th.  So what you are saying does not concern the day of the 14th.
Q.	Mr. Witness, we are finished talking about the meeting, at the end of which you say you were locked up in the church, and the next day the killings began, so the next day is obviously the 15th.
A.	Yes, that is correct, if what you have just said concerns the 15th.
Q.	When the refugees went into the church, who invited them there?
A.	Unless I have to repeat this a thousand times, I think I gave the answer already.  I repeated it.  And it is those leaders; the Interahamwe.  If you want me to repeat the names of those authorities, I will give them to you and then you should add the gendarmes, Father Seromba, the staff of the commune, the trader, the businessmen and Father Seromba.
Q.	Thank you.  You stated --
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, the witness is asking for the floor.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
I am not tired and I would not want us to interrupt the session, but I would like to request for some minutes to go and relieve myself.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we will wait for you in the courtroom here, so you may go ahead.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Counsel Monthé.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, you stated, and I'm taking us a few seconds backwards -- you said that on that night of the 14th of April you saw Father Seromba come and collect the sacred items before the attacks were launched the following day.  Is that correct?
A.	That was not my statement, Counsel.  I did say that on the 14th he came to the church, after having locked us up.  It was not on the following day.  You shouldn't put words into my mouth.
Q.	Well, I'm not putting any words into your mouth; I just asked a question.  If it is not correct, say so.

Now, on what day did you see Father Seromba come to take away the sacred items?
A.	That was on Thursday, the 14th of April 1994.
Q.	At what time?
A.	And that was in the evening.
Q.	According to you, in the church where were those sacred items kept?
A.	Those items are kept in the sacristy.
Q.	Were you refugees in the sacristy?
A.	In the sacristy room -- we were all over the place in the church.  No part of the church was spared.  We were all over in the church.
Q.	Should I take it that the sacristy was open?
A.	I would like, rather, to ask you if I understand what is a sacristy is.  If you do not know what it is, I can explain it to you.
Q.	Thank you for your clarifications.  Rather, answer my question and we will move ahead.  Remember that today I'm the one asking questions, and you are there to answer.  Was the sacristy open?

I did not hear your answer, Mr. Witness.
A.	Your question wasn't clear to me either.
Q.	My question is: was the sacristy open?
A.	Besides the sacristy, on all sides no side was closed.  But in the sacristy it was locked.  In a small room where the Hosts are kept, but as for that portion of the room, it was open.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I think I understand that you are a Christian.  You told us so.  Do we agree on that?
A.	I do acknowledge that.
Q.	Thank you.  According to you, what distinguishes a laybuilding of a church -- a laybuilding from a church?  What is the distinguishing mark between a laybuilding and a church?
A.	I am going to explain to you because, as you are aware -- well, I'm not going to ask you.  I know it normally.  The sacristy beginning from the altar on which the priest celebrates mass, behind that altar, where the priest celebrates mass, the place behind the altar, therefore, is called the sacristy.  In other words, the Hosts are found behind the altar.  As for the sacristy itself, that is where the vestments of the priests are kept; in other words, the room where the vestments of priests are kept wasn't open.  Not everybody is allowed to get into that room.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you did not answer my question.  I am going to rephrase it for you.
A.	Fine.
Q.	What does it take for one to say that the building that has just been constructed is a church?  Does it not have to be consecrated?
A.	That is the case, you know.
Q.	Now, let us make progress.  When a church is used for receiving, exceptionally, refugees, what is happening is that it is desecrated (sic), isn't it?
A.	There is a blessing.  There is the sacrament.  The two things are different.
Q.	Witness, what I am asking you is this: when they transform a church temporarily into a place of refuge for the reception of refugees, as this happens sometimes, when it is desecrated, the sacred objects are removed.  That is the process of desecrating it.  Don't you know that Father Seromba was aware of that?
A.	After the church is built, it is consecrated or sanctified.  I agree with you.  Furthermore, a church is sanctified when the Hosts are puts in it.  That is, when the sacred vestments of the priests are moved as well as the Hosts or the Eucharists, that means that the church has become an ordinary building like any other building and you can do whatever you like with it.  The church is no longer sacred.  The Eucharist is the heart of the church.  When you remove the heart of something, that thing is dead, and that is all.
Q.	Thank you, Witness, for this lecture on catechism.  Tell me: do you think Father Seromba and the clerics in the parish could have allowed the refugees to settle in the church if they hadn't removed well before then the sacred objects?
A.	Thank you very much.  This is a very good question.  Let us take an example.
Q.	Between you and me, please go straight to the answer.
A.	The answer that I will give you is that it is not possible -- it is not possible to remove chalices and vestments and attach more importance to it than to human beings.  Chalices and vestments belong to human beings.  So those objects are not more important than people.  You cannot kill people.  Those objects can disappear and can be bought again, but you cannot buy a human being.  The answer I would give you is, therefore, that importance should not be attached -- should not have been attached to sacred objects, as opposed to men.
Q.	You clearly haven't understood my question.  What I'm saying to you is this: Father Seromba, who is a priest, could not have allowed refugees to take refuge in the church without having removed the sacred objects well beforehand because this is impossible for Catholics.  I understand that you are Catholic.
A.	I agree with you.
Q.	If you agree with me, that is okay for me.  Still on this point --
A.	I have understood your question and I can give the answer now.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Wait for him to answer the question.

Yes, Witness, answer the question that was put to you.
THE WITNESS:
The answer I would give him is that the removal of sacred objects by Father Seromba on the pretext that the refugees were going to seek refuge there, it is -- it is not a law written anywhere.  We Christians have the right to be Christians.  The church belongs to us.  The church does not belong only to Seromba or anyone else.  This means that he should not have removed the chalices and the Eucharists.  He knows how people are saved with the sacraments.  When the Eucharists are removed, people's rights to be Christians are desecrated.  So removing the sacrament meant he took us for people who were no longer Christians, for heathens.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	I thank you.  Didn't you ask yourself why, when you arrived on the 10th of April in the parish, you did not sleep in the church, you slept instead in the catechism room?
A.	I will answer your question.  On the 10th, there were fewer of us and our numbers only increased on the 12th.  That is to say that, as from the 12th up to the 13th, the church was not locked.  Some people remained in the presbytery while others spent the night inside the church.  There are, therefore, groups in the presbytery -- one of the groups was in the presbytery while the other was in the church.  Father Seromba had not prevented us from staying in the presbytery and he hadn't deprived us of the rights to perform the adoration.  That right was removed on the 14th.
Q.	Witness, I would like you to note that if you were allowed to sleep in the catechism room on the 13th of April, it was because the sacred objects had not yet been removed from the church.  It does not have to do with the number of people.
A.	You were not there so I am explaining things to you.  I will explain why he did not remove the sacred objects on the 11th and on the 12th.  Whereas there were many of us, why did he not remove those sacred objects on the 13th?  Why on the 14th prior to midday did he not remove those objects; that is, before the meeting we made mention of?  Why did he remove those objects in the evening of the 14th; that is, the day before we had to be killed?
Q.	I think we have explained things, you and myself, as regards sacred objects.  We will move to something else.  But to wrap things up as regards the church, did -- the 48 refugees, since those are the people who slept in the catechism room, were they all Catholics or there were people from other denominations?
A.	At the time I could not make the distinction between the people so I am, therefore, not in a position to say whether or not people were mixed.  I know that we had the same problem: we were all refugees.
Q.	Thank you.  On the 14th when the killings started, what did you do?
A.	You mean what we did when the massacre started on the 15th?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreters cannot hear the counsel for the Defence so they didn't understand the question.
THE WITNESS:
Right.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	When the massacre started what did you do?
A.	I did nothing personally.  All the refugees did something, including myself.
Q.	Did you remain inside the church, since from what you have said it was locked?
A.	On the 14th -- on the 15th in the morning, we were allowed to go out.  We were in the courtyard in front of the church.  We could even go to the back courtyard of the presbytery.  We were no longer locked up in the church.
Q.	Who released you on that day?
A.	We were released by Father Athanase Seromba who came to open the door.
Q.	Did you see him open the door?
A.	He opened the door and he was in the company of gendarmes and told us to get out of the church.
Q.	But between the time when the doors were locked and the time when they were opened, did any of the people inside the church get killed?
A.	Could you repeat your question, Counsel?  It is not clear to me.
Q.	Willingly.  I would like to know whether, between the time when you were locked up in the church and the time when you were released, were some refugees killed inside the church.
A.	The refugees were not killed, but there were women and children who died from hunger.
Q.	Very well.  You were, therefore, authorised to get out even to go to the back courtyard of church.  What did the refugees do at that time?
A.	On the 15th, in the morning, when we were allowed to go out, we could do nothing.  We were there doing nothing.  We had confidence that we would live.  And when the attack was launched to kill us, we did something; but before the attack we did nothing.
Q.	And the attack took place at what time?
A.	The attack was launched on the 15th.  It was a Friday in April 1994.
Q.	When the attack was launched what did you, yourself, do?
A.	I have told you that there was nothing I could do.  I was not a person in charge of those refugees.  I would, rather, tell you what we all did as a group.
Q.	When the attack was launched, were you wounded, or you fled?
A.	When the attack was launched the assailants threw stones.  We did the same.  I did not flee.  I fled when they started throwing grenades.  I ran; we all ran towards the church.
Q.	But who threw those grenades?
A.	It is a young man called Rukara who was an army corporal.
Q.	And once the grenades were thrown, you again fled towards the church; is that right?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did you go into the church at that time?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did you shut the doors of the church?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And when you locked those doors, did you lock them from inside or outside?
A.	We locked them when we got inside the church.  What I can tell you is that it is not everyone who went into the church.  Some people did not succeed to do so and they were killed outside the church.
Q.	That is not my question.  My question has to do with the locking of the door.  Did you lock the door from inside?  You say yes.  So, as a matter of fact, that door could be locked from the inside since you did that; is that correct?
A.	That is right.  However, even though you thank me, I told you that there were doors that were locked from inside and another door that had a lock.  Regarding that door, we took benches to obstruct the entrance of that door which had a lock.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, once inside the church which you barricaded from inside, what did you do?
A.	Actually, something else happened to us.  The assailants tried to smash in the door with stones.  They even tried to cut it.  I heard that some doors were smashed in and the assailants came in and started throwing grenades and stones and killing people.  Stones were also being thrown through the windows, as well as grenades.  So, the benches which were used to erect a barricade were of no use.
Q.	When the assailants arrived, you, who were inside the church, did you remain in there, or you left the church?
A.	Are you referring to myself or those who were there as a whole?
Q.	Witness, I am talking to you.  You are the one giving evidence before this Chamber.  I'm not referring to the others.
A.	Okay.  I stayed inside.
Q.	So you stayed inside.  The attack continued inside the church; is that it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did you hide inside the church or you protected yourself from the attack?
A.	I hid somewhere.
Q.	Can you tell us where precisely?
A.	For now, I cannot answer that question.
Q.	I thank you.  You stated that the assailants had received orders during that attack to kill all the refugees; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Who issued those orders?
A.	The orders were issued by the authorities I mentioned earlier.  They were the people would issue the orders; namely, the bourgmestre, Grégoire Ndahimana, and the others whose names I mentioned.  Those were the people who issued orders that we should be killed.
Q.	Did you, yourself, hear those orders?  Witness CBJ, did you hear those orders yourself?
A.	Could you please repeat the question, Counsel?
Q.	I am asking, if you, yourself, in person, Witness CBJ, heard those orders that the refugees should be exterminated.
A.	I did not hear those orders because I was not an Interahamwe.
Q.	How, then, did you know that that order was issued?
A.	The fact of the matter is that the acts that we were subjected to were numerous and those authorities hadn't gone elsewhere.  They were involved in those attacks.
Q.	We do not contest the attacks.  The question is whether there was an order that all of you should be exterminated.  That is the question, and your answer is yes.  But you do not know the person who issued the order.  You said you hadn't heard.  That is why I want you to explain the situation.
A.	I have told you that I did not hear the order being given, but what was done to us and between us, I could see.  Another proof that an order was given, unless the victims in the church --
Q.	(No interpretation)
A.	If people are dead, they are no longer alive.  There must have been a plan to exterminate everybody.  The proof of that is that the people are dead.  They are no longer alive.
Q.	I'll try to bear that in mind.  Thank you.

Are you there?
A.	Yes, we are there.
Q.	Let us proceed, then.  Witness, if there was a plan of extermination at the church, could those planners, in parenthesis, not have decided simply to kill the Tutsi in the hills?  Why did they have to wait for them to get to the church?
A.	The killings in the villages had already occurred, but it was agreed that people should be allowed to flee towards the church.  Some people were killed in the villages, while others were allowed to go to the church.
Q.	You state that certain people were allowed to go towards the church.
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	On the 15th, had the roadblocks not yet been erected in the commune?
A.	Are you talking about the 15th?  Yes, on the 15th April 1994, almost in all the areas of the location of the commune, roadblocks had already been erected.
Q.	Were you Tutsis killed at those roadblocks?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now explain to me why could they have been left to get to the church even though they could have been killed at roadblocks.
A.	That is not what I said.  I told you that the roadblocks were erected on the 14th.  That is where I saw the roadblocks that were erected a bit further than the priests' banana farms at a place called Rugabano, after Codekoki, in the Nyange centre.  A roadblock was erected there.  So it was on that day of the 14th that the assailants started killing people.  So on the 14th of April there were no longer Tutsi in the rural areas.  They had already finished killing the Tutsi in the village.  That is how they came together to get to the church and kill the refugees who had sought refuge there in the church.
Q.	According to you, Mr. Witness, was there a single roadblock or there were many of them?
A.	There were very many roadblocks.
Q.	We, therefore, can believe that the Tutsi could no longer go to the church.
A.	I do not know if we are on the same wavelength, Counsel.  I am talking to you about the roadblocks of Thursday.  On Thursday, there were no longer any Tutsi who were fleeing towards the church because they had all been killed in the villages.  I have told you that up until the 14th there was no longer any person -- there were no longer any Tutsis fleeing towards church because they had all been killed in the villages.
Q.	Very good.  So, only those who were in the church were still remaining?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	Now, talk to us about the manner in which you were in church.  You were in church.  Grenades were thrown at you.  What did the refugees do?  You hid yourself.  What did the others do?
A.	Well, I had hidden myself.  I told you that I cannot give you the spot at which I was hiding, unless we go into a closed session.  So I cannot give you an answer to that for now.
Q.	Now, the place where you had hid yourself, I asked you what did the other refugees do, since you were hidden -- or you hid yourself.
A.	The refugees, my companions, couldn't do anything else.  They were being killed and they had nothing else to do.
Q.	Very good.  And you, you remained in your hiding place up until when?
A.	If I were to give you the answer, I would fall into the trap that you are trying to set for me.
Q.	I'm not setting any trap for you.  You can keep your answer for now.  We will have time.  From your hiding place, were you able to see Father Seromba?
A.	Yes, I could see him.
Q.	Where was he, according to you?
A.	He was standing on the upper floor of their building.
Q.	What do you mean by "their building"?
A.	I'm referring to their residential quarters, which is a storey-building, where they were living, their residence, if you want.
Q.	You mean the presbytery?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Was he all alone when you were seeing him?
A.	No.
Q.	With whom was he?
A.	He was in the company of Father Edward Nturiye; Kayiranga, Emmanuel; the major seminarian; Appollonaire Hakizimana.
Q.	And where were all those -- what were all those clerics doing on upper floor of the building, according to you?
A.	Those clerics were in the company of Father Seromba watching the massacres that were taking place.
Q.	Did -- Fathers Nturiye and Kayiranga, on that upper floor, in the parish -- had they been in the parish for a long time?
A.	No.
Q.	In your opinion, did they take part in the massacres?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And how?
A.	I talked to you about a man called Anicet Gatare, who was the youth coordinator in the commune.  I told you that in the evening of Friday he was flushed out while he was hiding in the outer courtyard of the presbytery.  Father Nturiye and Kayiranga and Father Seromba, as well as the major seminarian and Habiyambere, flushed him out from that place and he was killed, but he was killed outside the church.
Q.	You say, however, that Gatare, Anicet, was flushed out outside the presbytery; is that correct?
A.	Now, are we talking about Gatare, Boniface, or Anicet?
Q.	We are talking about Boniface (sic) Gatare, the youth coordinator of the commune.  So, where exactly was Boniface Gatare?  Because I didn't quite understand you, and I'm sorry.
A.	He was hiding in the backyard of the presbytery behind the kitchens.
Q.	Very good.  And what happened to him?
A.	He was discovered when they got near the water tower, in the middle of the courtyard of the presbytery.  There was light, and he was crying for help and he was shouting, "Where are you taking me?  Where are you dragging me?"  Finally, they continued to take him further, and I don't know exactly where they killed him.
Q.	When you say "they", whom are you referring to?
A.	I'm referring to Father Athanase Seromba and to Father Edward Nturiye; Father Emmanuel Kayiranga; the major seminarian, Appollinaire; Hakizimana; as well as many other persons I couldn't identify.  There was also Seromba's watchman called Canisius Habiyambere.
Q.	Very good.  So from the storey-building where the clerics were, they were able to see Gatare in the backyard of the presbytery, that is, after the water tank leading to the banana grove.
A.	No, that is not my statement.
Q.	So where was he found; towards the water tank, isn't it?
A.	No instructions were given.  Father Athanase Seromba had given instructions.  He called the watchman called Canisius Habiyambere and asked him, "Be careful; you should make sure that no Tutsi should be hiding in the backyard."  I don't know if he made a sign to him.  I saw the father, who was going back into his room in the upper floor.  He came out again with some other persons whose names I gave you, and then they entered through the kitchen door and went to the backyard.  Then I saw him bringing back the coordinator, Gatare - well, I have told you about what followed.  They, therefore, did not see him from the upper floor on which they were standing.
Q.	So once they came down?
A.	Before that.  It is the watchman who discovered him; that is, Canisius Habiyambere.  The watchman is the one who discovered him.  When Seromba made that statement to him, I think there was probably somebody who was hiding behind, and that is how I saw them to go towards the backyard to flush them out.
Q.	When he was discovered, from which side was he brought?  Was it the presbytery or elsewhere?  Where was he taken?
A.	They made him to pass through the door of the presbytery which is close to the secretariat.  They led him towards the front courtyard of the church, and then they disappeared on other side of the courtyard of the church.  I, therefore, do not know exactly at what location they killed him.
Q.	(No interpretation)
A.	No, I was not able to witness the scene of his death.  What is clear is that he was no longer alive.
Q.	Did you see he was dead?
A.	No.
Q.	How, therefore, can you infer that he is dead?
A.	I will put the question back to you:  can you show me that person now?
Q.	You told us yesterday that he might have been shot with a gun at the level of the chest; is that correct?
A.	No, you are putting words into my mouth.  You are saying things that I never said.
Q.	How many Gatares died, therefore?
A.	I saw only one Gatare die.  As for the second Gatare, I am not aware of the circumstances of his death.
Q.	And the one you saw die, was it Boniface?
A.	No.
Q.	So which Gatare are we talking about, then?
A.	Are you still talking about Gatare, Boniface?  But I have told you that I don't know the circumstances of his death, but he died on that location.  But for Anicet Gatare -- there was the Gatare who was the youth coordinator, and there was another Gatare who was a teacher.
Q.	So I was talking to you about the teacher when I said that he received a bullet on the chest, just below where Father Seromba was.  Now, for my enlightenment, according to you, Boniface died, but you didn't see his corpse; Boniface Gatare, I mean.
A.	That is correct.
Q.	We, therefore, consider that he is dead.  You didn't see his corpse, but he is dead.
A.	I did not see his mortal remains, but I know that he was killed.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now let's come back to Anicet Gatare, the one who was a teacher.  Are we agreed?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Were you there when he died?
A.	Yes, I witnessed the scene.
Q.	You were still in your hiding place?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Thank you.  Can you tell the Chamber the circumstances under which he met his death?
A.	Yes, okay.  Anicet Gatare died on Friday, the 15th of April 1994.  He was killed in the backyard, but before his death -- Father Athanase Seromba was on the upper floor of the building -- Gatare was in front of the door of the corridor which leads to the upper floor.  He was wearing a black jacket.  So I saw people who were climbing the wall, coming from outside, but who were coming to take refuge inside the church.  So I heard Father Seromba, who was on the balcony, say, "Why are these people climbing the wall?"  There was a gendarme, who was light in complexion and who opened fire, and he fell.
Q.	Now the gendarme opened fire.  Did you see Gatare fall?  And at what spot did he receive the bullet, do you know?
A.	The bullet hit Gatare's chest.
Q.	Thank you.  So, you and I are agreed a while ago when we said that he died from a bullet that impacted on his chest.
A.	Yes, if you are referring to Gatare the teacher.
Q.	Yes, he is the one we are talking about, Mr. Witness
A.	Gatare, Anicet.
Q.	Yes, that one; the teacher.  We are not talking about Boniface anymore.  Did he die?
A.	Yes.
Q.	 Thank you.  Thank you.  Did he die in the inner courtyard of the presbytery or outside the presbytery?
A.	Whom are you talking about, Counsel?
Q.	We are talking about one person; we are not talking about the other person anymore.  Did the teacher die inside the courtyard of the presbytery or outside?
A.	Gatare, Anicet, the teacher was killed in the rear courtyard of the presbytery in front of the corridor of the presbytery.
Q.	Well and good.  Did you see his mortal remains?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Were his mortal remains moved, in your opinion?
A.	Anicet Gatare's corpse, well, his legs were shot at by a certain Mporanyi de Cyambogo.  They dragged him from the rear court of the presbytery -- from the rear courtyard of the presbytery and he was left in front of secretariat.  They undressed him and started humiliating him once they got to the front of the secretariat.
Q.	When you say "they", who are the persons you are referring to?
A.	I told you that it is that Murindanyi who dragged his corpse to the office of the secretariat.  There were also other Interahamwe who undressed him.  He was naked through and through.
Q.	And before the secretariat there was crowd?
A.	There were many people there.
Q.	So the teacher was undressed in front of all those people?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And, you, you were able to see all of this from your hiding place?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Was -- did the crowd react to the undressing, to the atrocious undressing of that corpse?
A.	You shouldn't put that question to me but, rather, to the Interahamwe.
Q.	I will repeat: you were watching the crowd from your hiding place.  Can you tell us if there was any reaction of astonishment from the crowd?
A.	Well, they were a crowd of Interahamwe.  How do you expect them to have any consternation?  Probably if the members of his family had been present, they would have been shocked.  As for the Interahamwe, they were rather happy.  And besides, they even said certain statements which I wonder if it's necessary to tell you.
Q.	Yes; what did they say?
A.	I would not delve into an excess of detail.  I am not accusing the people who made those statements before this Chamber.  I lodged a complaint against those people before the gacaca courts.  I don't think we need to address this issue before this Tribunal because this is being handled by the gacaca courts.
Q.	Well, you are the one who talked about these statements, not yours truly, Mr. Witness.  Tell me:  you state that "if his family had been present".  So the teacher Gatare was alone in the church; he came there alone, to die there?
A.	When he came to the church, he came with his family; that is, with his wife and children.
Q.	And where was his family when he was killed?
A.	The members of his family were in the parish, but I do not know exactly where they were; that is, where Gatare's family members were at that time.
Q.	And Father Seromba, where was he when Gatare was being dragged?
A.	He was standing on the upper floor of the presbytery and was observing all that was happening where Gatare's body was.  Indeed, from where he was standing, he started throwing bottles of beer to the Interahamwe who were down below.
Q.	Those Interahamwes, were they in the presbytery courtyard?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And what were they doing at that time when he threw beer bottles to them?
A.	They were killing Tutsi who had sought refuge in the parish.
Q.	Tell me: in Rwanda when people offer beer to people, do they just throw it at them like that, or it was something new?
A.	Regarding the manner in which the beer was given, perhaps you should ask the person concerned.  I cannot read his mind.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.
MR. MONTHÉ:
I thank you, Madam President.  I am at your disposal.  I thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you have -- will you be long with this witness tomorrow?
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I'll try to facilitate your work.  We still have quite a bit of work.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well then.

Prosecutor, who is the next witness after CBJ?
MR. TOWNSEND:
As announced previously, the witness who would follow CBJ is CBN; Charlie, Bravo, November.  The one following that one is also as announced, CNJ; Charlie, November, Juliet.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, the two witnesses, Materassi Massimo and Allessandro Farrugia, are they already here, or not?
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, Your Honours, one of those witnesses is here, but there's a problem of interpreters.  We made a motion, a written motion, seeking the assistance of an interpreter, but the language section sent me this message -- I received this message yesterday -- and they said it wasn't possible.  My request was made a long time ago, but it was only yesterday that I was able to understand that the language section does not have an interpreter available.

So I now turn to the registry and, perhaps with the assistance of the Chamber -- such services are provided for by the Rules; Article 3(E) makes provision for that.  So I think they should make an interpreter available for hearing that witness.  As for Farrugia, he is not yet available in Arusha.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you think the same problem will arrive with Farrugia as well, as far as the language issue?
MS. ARBIA:
Farrugia can speak the language fluently.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Pognon.
MR. POGNON:
Could we know who of those witnesses is available since those are not anonymous witnesses?  I think Farrugia and Massimo are both unprotected witnesses.  The name of the person was not given, whereas we know there is no protection for that witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think Massimo is there, and Farrugia is not there.  Is that what I understand?
MS. ARBIA:
Yes, Madam President.  Materassi Massimo is here, but we have the problem of non-availability of an interpreter; whereas, Farrugia Allessandro is not yet here in Arusha.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you for the information.

Witness, we remind you that you are still under oath.  We wish you a good night, and tomorrow you will still be cross-examined by Counsel Monthé.

We don't have a courtroom for tomorrow morning, according to the information that has been communicated to me.  Consequently, we will meet only in the afternoon at 2 p.m.

The proceedings are adjourned.   I thank you all.  Good evening.
(Court adjourned at 1837H)
