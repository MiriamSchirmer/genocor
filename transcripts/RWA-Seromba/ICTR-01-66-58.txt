(Witness entered courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session now.  Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.

And I'd like to remind the court registry that the witness should be seated by the time we come in.  We have lost a few minutes because the witness hadn't been settled.

Good morning, Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you prepared to proceed with the examination?
THE WITNESS:
Madam President, Your Honours, as I told you yesterday, I am very ill.  Up until this very moment, I'm unable to breathe well; nor can I hear well.  Even during the night, I felt very ill.  I have pains in my lungs.  I have a lung infection.  And that is what I wanted to tell you so that you can take the appropriate decision.  So, I have breathing problems and that is the problem I wanted to raise with you, Madam President.  And thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.

Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.
MR. MOSES:
The reason -- for the reasons I raised yesterday in camera, Your Honours, certainly I would not be opposing, if this witness was unwell now, for him to complete his testimony early next week in the hope that he has made some recovery.  It certainly wouldn't be any inconvenience.  My concern is that if his testimony starts now and we then need to break in any event for at least part of the day, he is not going to be finished with his evidence by the end of the day, which may lead to an application from me, in any event.  I just thought I would raise that with Your Honours now.

I haven't, obviously, discussed it with my learned friend because I don't think either of us were aware that the witness was unwell until he was brought into court this morning.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Monthé, you want to address the Court?
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, Madam President, Your Honours, the concern of the Defence is to be sure that Mr. Nkinamubanzi, Anastase, can indeed express himself fully and comfortably.  I understand the Prosecutor's concern.  I understand his escape link concerns, by I wouldn't like, either, that we should be under pressure.  Madam President, my concern is that we see, with the witness, if he really is in the position to talk this morning.  If he is unable to express himself, well we will be advised on that, but I can't say more than that, but I would like to tell you that I would have liked to be done with my examination-in-chief, and that is my concern as of now.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Monthé.

Mr. Witness Nkinamubanzi, do you think you will be able to continue with the examination -- in giving evidence by trying to give brave answers?  And I'm sure Mr. Monthé will also be very concise in his questions.  This would help you.  Then we can continue with your cross-examination, unless you think we may need to keep you here for another week.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.  I think I have come to testify before this Trial Chamber of my own volition and to bear witness for Father Seromba.  I didn't intend to come here and pretend to be sick or to play games.  My wish, actually, is to continue and conclude my testimony, but my problem is that I have serious lung problems, unless you want to end the trial and give your ruling tomorrow.  Otherwise, I would request some more time so that I can rest and then resume giving testimony next week.  I think you, yourself, must have realised that, physically, I am very unfit, I am weak.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we are well aware that your condition is not tops right now.  You appear to be tired.  So, Prosecutor, do you wish to introduce a motion?  Do you wish to file a motion; is that what you said a while ago?
MR. MOSES:
No.  I think, Your Honour, if the witness is asking for further time, I really am indicating to Your Honour that we wouldn't oppose him finishing his evidence next week, if that is what the witness is wanting.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Monthé, we have listened to the witness and we have heard the Prosecutor.  You also addressed the Court a while ago.  The question the Bench is asking is -- if you are going to conclude your examination-in-chief within a very short time, probably you could put your questions to him so that he could rest up until next week for the cross-examination, but, then, we still have to know what you have as questions, so -- whether your questions won't take much time.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, there is a saying in my village, which says that if anything is worth doing, it's worth doing well.  So I don't know if this witness is uncomfortable healthwise.  I wouldn't want to doctor my work or to miss -- mishandle my work simply because we want to proceed fast.  But if it so happens that he can testify next week, I think we can do everything this week.  Like that, the witness would have rested and I think we would -- then we would be able to proceed, all of us.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now, can you make it clear to us, Counsel, how much time you would need for the continuation of the examination-in-chief?  How much time do you still need for the examination-in-chief?
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, we should expect that we will use about two hours, on average.  I think we have informally told the Prosecutor that we can take two hours or two hours 30 minutes, maximum, but those are special conditions.  But, now, if we have an additional week, we make a longer time.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will request that the witness be taken to the clinic so that we can see what can be done about his health.  Thank you.

So, can the next witness be called in?

Mr. Nekuie, are you the one who will be examining the next witness?  Can you tell us which witness will be appearing now?
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  The next witness will be Witness FE31.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can Witness FE31 be called in, please?
MR. MOSES:
Your Honours, my learned friend Mr. Townsend is going to be taking this witness, and if I can be excused, I would appreciate that.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Mr. Moses.  You may retire.
(Witness FE32 exited courtroom)
(Witness FE31 entered courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Moses, well, you said this to us in camera.  Can you tell us on which day you will be returning, like that -- we can do the scheduling of witnesses?
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honours.  I am due to leave this evening and due to arrive next Monday evening, and so I'll be gone for two and a half days' time of court time, next Monday, three or four days' time.
JUDGE HÖKBORG:
That means that we can call the witness for Tuesday, right?

MR. MOSES:
Absolutely.
JUDGE HÖKBORG:
Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, everyone.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are a Defence protected witness, so we will refer to you as Witness FE31.
THE WITNESS:
I understand.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Defence will lead you in evidence in-chief, and try to be as brief and concise as possible in answering the questions that will be put to you.  Thereafter, the Prosecutor will cross-examine you.  Prior to that, we will like to request you to take -- or, to make the solemn declaration.
(Declaration made by Witness FE31 in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.

Mr. Nekuie, you may now proceed with the examination-in-chief.
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, Your Honours, this morning I will be leading the witness in examination-in-chief; that is, Witness FE31.  I will start by greeting him.
WITNESS FE31,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, FE31, good morning.
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, Your Honours, with your leave, I will call on the registry clerk to send round this personal identification sheet, which I would also request the witness to look at it so that we subsequently tender it as a Defence exhibit.

Thank you, Mr. Registry Official.
Do I have leave to proceed, Madam President?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Has the witness read over the document?

Mr. Witness, have you checked to see whether the details there are correct?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Madam President, everything therein is correct.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, you may proceed.
MR. NEKUIE:
I am obliged, Madam President.
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness FE31, do you therefore confirm that the particulars on that sheet do correspond to the information relating to your identification?
A.	All the particulars therein are correct.
Q.	On account of that confirmation, Madam President, Your Honours, we would like to pray the Bench to admit this document as a Defence exhibit, reference No. D. 72.  I'd also wish that it be placed under seal.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.

Any objection on the part of the Prosecutor?
MR. TOWNSEND:
No.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The personal identification sheet of Witness FE31 is hereby admitted as a Defence exhibit under reference No. F -- D. 72 and be placed under seal.  So, you may proceed with the examination-in-chief of the witness.
(Exhibit No. D. 72 admitted, under seal)
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness FE31, I am now going to put questions to you on the events that you knew that occurred in Rwanda in 1994, in April 1994.  Are you prepared to answer the questions that I will be putting to you?
A.	I am very ready.
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE31.  Witness, were you in Rwanda in 1994?  If the answer is in the affirmative, in what area were you living at that time and, more specifically, in April 1994?
A.	In 1994 I was living at **************, Nyange secteur, and that is where I was when the war broke out, and that is my native secteur.
Q.	Thank you, FE31.  When you answer that that's where you were when the war broke out --
A.	Yes, that's where I was.  I want to ask whether I should answer sitting, or should I stand to answer?
Q.	You will answer in the position which you occupy now.  It is Defence counsel who is required to stand in order to lead you in evidence.  Now, let me repeat my question.  I couldn't ask it fully.  My question was to ask you to tell us what you meant by "when the war broke out" while you were in *************.  What did you mean by "when the war broke out"?
A.	Now, regarding the war, let me briefly say, on the 7th, in the morning, there was a communiqué over the radio and it talked of the death of the head of state.  It was further announced that no one had to leave his or her place of residence to go anywhere.  It was at that time that the war broke out.  Now, the next day, on the 8th or the 9th, war erupted in Murambi.  That is where a certain Ndungutse lived.  The family of a certain Aloys Rwamasirabo was killed.  Now, the next Saturday, that was the 9th -- in the night of the 9th to the 10th, in the Ngobagoba secteur, in Ngobagoba cellule, a certain agricultural assistant by the name Aloys was killed.  I don't know whether any investigations were conducted subsequently.  Now, with regard to their burial, Rwamasirabo had to take charge of that.  Those who were -- who participated in the burial were stoned.  And when Tutsis noticed that they were being persecuted, they didn't go back to their homes; they stayed in the church.

On Monday, they stayed at the church, and on Tuesday attackers came from Ndungutse's area and they were burning houses on their way.  They went through the health centre and went to Rushema's house at Nyaruraza.  It was after that incident that the Tutsis continued to run away from their places of abode or residence.  The next day, Wednesday, people continued to run from their places of residence to the parish.
Q.	Sorry to interrupt.  I believe you have answered my question.  All I merely wanted from you was for you to tell me what you meant by "when the war broke out".  And you spoke of the death of President Habyarimana.  You learnt of the death on the 7th.  And all these other events you are narrating, I would urge you to allow the Court to get that information through the various questions I'm going to ask you on those events.  If that does not inconvenience you, I would ask you to allow me to put the next question to you.  I hope you are not inconvenienced.
A.	I fully agree.
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE31.
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, Your Honours, to ensure the protection of the witness, and in view of the fact it is highly likely that names will be mentioned following the questions I'm putting to him, I would like that you order that we continue in closed session.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, no objection?

MR. TOWNSEND:
No.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will now sit in closed session to ensure the protection of the witness and the interest of justice.

Sorry for members of the public.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 8 to 18] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 1 to 7 by Verna Butler)





























MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have reverted to the open session.  You may proceed with the examination-in-chief of the witness.
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness FE31, you stated that some of the refugees at the church -- it's not the word "refugees" that you used, but you said some other persons that you were attacking on the 15th April 1994 withdrew into the church and remained inside the church.  Were you able to see how they withdrew and went inside the church on that day?
A.	Yes, I was in the courtyard and I saw them entering the church.  And when gun -- gunshots were being fired, I withdrew and went and stood near the statue of the Virgin Mary.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  But why did the attackers who were chasing them not penetrate into the church in order to kill them as they were doing?
A.	When they got inside the church, they locked themselves inside the church, itself.
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE31.  Did they lock themselves up upon orders given by a third party, or did they do that themselves in order to escape from the attackers?
A.	They locked themselves up there in order to avoid the attackers.
Q.	Thank you, Witness F31.  Now, during those attacks, were you able to see at the location Father Seromba, Athanase?
A.	Father Seromba was not on the site.  If he had come from the parish to that site, I would have seen him.  But since earlier speaking, I'll tell you that I didn't see him there; he didn't come there.
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE31.  With respect to Gatare - Gatare, Anicet, whom Kayishema came and talked to you about, did he tell you who precisely had killed him?
A.	I didn't see anyone kill Gatare, but, later, those people, who were killing others with machetes, found him on the spot and he allegedly told gendarmes -- or, asked the gendarmes to shoot at him so that he wouldn't die by machete wounds.  Well, that is what was said.  I wasn't there and I didn't hear those statements.
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE31.  Were you also told in respect of him that he was handed over to the gendarmes by someone whose name I haven't mentioned to you?
A.	No, I heard of no one who handed him over to the gendarmes.  And, besides, nobody would have been able to hand him over because people found him on the spot at the time the grenade was thrown.  So nobody could have handed him over.  The assailants found him at the location and killed him there.
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE31.  Now, Witness, since you acknowledge that you were at the location and that you actually took part in the attacks, I would like you, really, to clarify -- or, to enlighten this Chamber on a number of issues that I feel are not yet understood.  Before I invite you to give those clarifications, I would like to ask you: did you --  were you, indeed, present at those attacks from the beginning right up to the end, I mean, you, in person; were you present?
A.	I participated in the attack of the 15th and it was a Friday.  The next day, that is, the 16th, I did not return to Nyange.  When the rain was falling, I was at home in my house, and the following morning, while I was in my home, I was taking my cow to pasture and there were other persons who went to Nyange.  A certain Nyawera, the uncle of the conseiller, Habarugira, came.  He had a cow with him.  He greeted me, and I answered, and he put -- he left the cow in the same pasture land as mine.  And at that time people were going to Nyange, and he asked me why I had not participated in the attacks like the others were doing.  I told him that I was tending to my cow, and he asked me to tend to the ones that he had brought with him.  And I asked him if he was going to pay me for me to be tending to his cows.  Well, he was accompanied by three other persons who asked him to come along with them.  So he left those cows with me that I had to tend to at the same time that I was tending to mine.  So I kept watch over them throughout the day, and at about two o'clock, p.m., I led them to the stable of a certain -- to the cowshed of a certain Alexander Ndambanda (phonetic), and I closed (as interpreted) them at *****************************************.

On the other side, that is, on the side of the church, things were deteriorating.  It was being said that the church was being demolished, and at about 1:00 or 2 p.m. there was an attack led by people that had come from Kibilira.  And the conseiller, Habarugira, of Nyange, who had come accompanied by those persons, and of a certain Nyawera, asked me to give them the cows that I had been watching.  I went to the cowshed - or, stable and showed them the cows in question.  The assailants who had come from Kibiligira (sic) were on the road that led to Kigali.  And the conseiller, Habarugira, gave those cows to those assailants who had come from Kibilira.  As far as I was concerned, I was involved in the attack that was launched on the 15th.  And on the 16th, that is, the next day, I was attending to the cows and didn't return to Nyange.
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE31.  Actually, I was talking about the attack on the 15th in which you took part, Witness.  I merely want you to tell me -- to enlighten me on the following: did you take part in the attack on the 15th from the beginning to the end of the attack?  Can you tell this Trial Chamber, and I'm referring to the attack of the 15th?
A.	I did not continue right up to the end of the attack because when -- or, I returned home when the rain started falling, and I was not able to witness what happened after.
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE31.  While you were participating in the attack, you said you did not see Father Athanase Seromba.  You say that you were told that Gatare, Anicet, had been killed by gendarmes, and, apparently -- upon his request.  And, yet, Witness, I would like with you to look at what has been said here before this Trial Chamber and ask what your opinion is -- or, your reaction is.  It is said that on that day, the 15th of April 1994, in order to mobilise the refugees that were hiding in the church, Father Seromba, who, himself, was carrying a gun, handed over Gatare to the gendarmes to be killed, and that is how the attackers, that you were, were so galvanised.  What do you have to say about these claims?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.
MR. TOWNSEND:
The witness has testified to his observations, and the evidence as to Gatare is only hearsay.  To inquire as to his opinion is an impermissible question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nekuie, do you want to rephrase your question, or did you want to respond to the objection?
MR. NEKUIE:
I would like to respond to the objection, Madam President, because I'm not asking the witness to give his opinion on the events.  The witness says that while he was on the statue of Virgin Mary he learned that Gatare, Anicet, was killed by gendarmes, and it so happens that he was one of the attackers.  And I think it has been established before this Court that Gatare, Anicet, and the circumstances surrounding his death are -- have been attributed to Father Seromba who, allegedly, galvanised the attack.  So I want him to confirm this, given that he was present at the spot.  The idea, therefore, is not to get his opinion.  I am talking about what he was able to witness on the spot and what encouraged him to carry on with the attack.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nekuie, you may proceed with the examination of the witness.
MR. NEKUIE:
I am obliged, Madam President.
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness FE31, the question I was putting to you was whether it is true that it is because Father Seromba had given -- handed over Gatare, Anicet -- and (unintelligible) that you were galvanised to continue with the attack while you were at the location.
A.	We were near the statue and we were -- stones were being thrown.  The grenade had already been thrown.  With the first grenade, people died.  A second grenade was thrown and people also died, while others were killed with machetes in that courtyard.
Q.	Now, according to you, do you think that Seromba had any connection with those events?
A.	No, if Father Seromba was at the location, and that he had handed over Gatare, he couldn't hand over Gatare, rather, and leave the other -- most of his family (as interpreted).  That's impossible.  He was not at the spot.
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE31.  It is alleged that Father Athanase Seromba was one of the attackers and that he was carrying a gun.  Did you see him while you were carrying out the attacks?
A.	I cannot confirm such events.  I didn't see him at the location and I didn't see him armed.  We were attacked because we were incited to do so by the authorities.  He could not be attacked and be leading the attack at the same time, whereas he was targeted by the assailants.
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE31.  At the time you left the location, on that 15th April 1994, what was the last scene you saw when you left?  How were the assailants behaving?  The assailants with whom you were, what were they doing, precisely?
A.	When I left, the bodies had just been buried.  And -- and guns were being fired towards the church, and when I left, the rain was about to fall, and I cannot tell you what happened later.
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE31.  Did any assailant withdraw at the same time as you when you were leaving, or did they remain on the spot?
A.	Most of us left, running.  Roadblocks had even been erected to intercept us, but I must say that most of us left because of the rain that was about to fall.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When you say that roadblocks had been erected to intercept you, could you know -- were you in a position to know who had erected the roadblocks?
A.	It was Kayishema who had ordered that the roadblocks be mounted in order to prevent people from leaving Nyange to go elsewhere.  So we were stopped and prevented from withdrawing and leaving the Nyange centre, and it was because of the rain that was about to fall we were able to go away.
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE31.  Do you know when exactly those roadblocks were mounted, and can you be more specific as to the location on which they were mounted?
A.	On that Friday, there was a roadblock mounted at Mutanoga and, later, after the church had been demolished, other roadblocks were mounted.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When you say that the IPJ Kayishema had mounted roadblocks in order to stop you from going your way, were you saying that he was trying to force you to attack the refugees?
A.	Yes, he was forcing us to carry out the attack.
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE31.  And in order to force you to do so, apart from those that you mentioned, that is, Kayishema and Ndungutse, were they acting in conjunction with other persons?
A.	Yes, there were other persons who were conniving with them.
Q.	Can you remember some of those persons and can you talk about them to the Trial Chamber?
A.	There was this businessman whose name I didn't want to call.  There were these reserve officers.  I would rather say that Kayishema and Ndungutse were the leaders -- the ringleaders, but there were other persons whose names I did not know and who came from other secteurs.  There was only one secteur that wasn't represented at Nyange, but I would say that there were many people.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, do you think it is time for us to take a break?  And can you please ask the witness why he doesn't want to give the name of that businessman?  Since apparently he mentioned other names he knew, but doesn't want to mention the name of the businessman, can he explain why?

The Court stands adjourned for some minutes.
(Court recessed at 1102H)
(Pages 19 to 22 by Verna Butler)


(Court resumed at 1123H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is called to order. 

Mr. Nekuie, you may now proceed with the examination in chief. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Obliged, Madam President.
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	FE31, before the break we were talking about the attacks that occurred on the 15th of April in which you participated.  In answer to one of my questions, you talked of your experience on the 16th of April.  You said you were not at the Nyange church.  Let me round up on this 15th of April 1994 by asking you the following question:  Were you rewarded for your involvement in the attacks on that day?
A.	No, I was not rewarded.  No one asked me to participate in the army, so no party paid me.
Q.	Thank you, FE31.  Did you know or were you able to know whether the other attackers received any payments? 
A.	Later on, after the people had died, that is, when it was being said that the person who had killed the largest number of people would be given - or, rewarded with some estate, but nothing was given to me, personally. 
Q.	FE31, when you referred to "they", could you tell us the names of those who were making those promises of payment, if you do know? 
A.	In the various cellules those who had killed the largest number of people were given some bonus, depending on their involvement in the attacks and the manner in which the attacks were conducted.  
For instance, Ndungutse, Alfred Ruzirabwoba, during the Gacaca courts sessions, members of the population said that Alfred Ruzirabwoba was rewarded for having killed the first person in his area. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE31.  Do you know who handed those rewards out at that time? 
A.	Ndungutse did.  He was the leader of all those attacks in Murambi. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE31.  Did you at that time come to know whether apart from Ndungutse, somebody else, and in particular, namely, Father Seromba, gave rewards to the assailants? 
A.	You keep on mentioning Father Seromba as if he was somebody who had led an attack; he was, himself, attacked.  How could he have taken part in any attacks?  Where would he, in fact, have led an attack because he, himself, is the one who came under attack, after all? 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE31.  Witness, you talked about the Gacaca courts a moment ago and you said that you had confessed before those courts.  Could you tell the Trial Chamber the conditions under which you confessed to the Gacaca courts?  Did you do so freely, or were you coerced in any way? 
A.	Nobody compelled me to confess to my crimes.  I committed those crimes in broad daylight.  Nobody ever compelled me to confess to my crimes.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE31.  When you confessed freely to those crimes, you also went to the pains of giving the details of your participation in the perpetration of such crimes; is that correct?  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Thank you.  In the description that you gave of your participation in the attacks, did you mention Father Seromba's name as a person who was a co-assailant or a fellow assailant? 
A.	No, I never mentioned his name.  When I gave an account of what had happened in the Gacaca courts or in Nyange, I never named him as an attacker or an assailant of 15th of April 1994. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE31.  Were you asked questions in the Gacaca courts on a subject of 
	Father Seromba's participation? 
A.	Yes, I was asked questions on the subject, but I denied having seen Father Seromba on the 15th of April. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE31.  Were you also accused by that court for having been responsible for the murder of *********, whose name you mentioned during our interview? 
A.	Yes, ************************************************************* had been killed by a gunshot, I had rid him of all his clothing. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE31.  And what did you reply to this allegation? 
A.	I defended myself by saying that this old man, when he was shot, that I didn't see him killed by a gunshot, that I only came to hear of that piece of information, namely, that he had died or been killed on the same day, but I never saw his body.  I then asked for proof or evidence to be produced, and they said that he had seen me because ************************************.  I said that it was impossible, that he can't fall out ************************.  

I was imprisoned for *** years and I had time to talk with my fellow detainees.  And we were shown on television that Kagenzi had brought allegations against Seromba.  So one of my fellow detainees said that that person dares to say that he survived ****************************, whereas on that very date, the 15th of April, he was hiding in my home.  [So that person gave me that piece of information, and when I went to defend myself before the Gacaca courts, I repeated that information.  They then adjourned the Gacaca court session and said that they would reconvene and I said, "Why are you adjourning?  Why are you adjourning the case when I have a witness who says that Kagenzi was in my home?"]  So I asked Kagenzi to appear before the court in order for him to explain how he came to find himself ***************. 

So when I asked for Kagenzi to appear before the court, they once again adjourned.  And in the meantime, we had appeared before the Nyange Gacaca court and we had been taken back to *******************.  Therefore, that person who had given me the information appeared before the Gacaca court.  We met with him by chance when he was on his way to the solidarity camp.  
There is a lady by the name of Nyabahindi, who is accused of having rid ********* of his clothing, but when at the end of the trial there was a conviction, he was freed of all allegations because they then put the blame on that lady for having taken ********* clothing.  Before the ruling was handed down -- before, in fact, I was convicted, they said that they had to make or set up another trial chamber in order to hear my case.  And to this day, I have not been tried.  My case was adjourned, and today I still don't know what the situation is. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could the witness please spell the name of the lady he mentioned?
MR. NEKUIE:
Witness FE31, could you please spell the name of the lady that you gave in your account.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
N-Y-I-R-A-D-A-H-I-N-D-I (sic) Nyirabahindi, a B instead of a D. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE31. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
I move for a short closed session, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Nekuie, the Prosecutor is requesting for us to go into closed session.
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, the Defence had already asked for a closed session.  So if the Prosecutor is asking for it, too, I don't see why we would be opposed to it. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, could you tell us why you would like us to go into closed session?  
MR. TOWNSEND:
Yes, but I prefer to say that in closed session, if it may please the Trial Chamber, for purposes of witness protection.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  So, we will go into a closed session in order to hear the reasons that the Prosecutor says that he cannot advance in open session.  We think that it will be short-lived, and we are very sorry for the people in the public gallery. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 26 to 28] was extracted and sealed under separate cover as the session was heard in camera) 
(Pages 23 to 25 by Sithembiso Moyo)







MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are now in open session.  

Counsel, you may proceed with your examination. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness FE31, when and in what circumstances did you learn or hear that the church had been destroyed? 
A.	I heard the same day, the day -- the very day that the church was destroyed because there were people coming from the church and they met me where I was tending my livestock, especially those people who had come from Kibilira.  They found me where I was tending my cows, and at that time - or, at that moment, the conseiller handed over his cows to them.  That was on the 16th of April that I heard of the information. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE31.  When they told you the news, did they say that they had attacked the church with the involvement or participation of Father Seromba? 
A.	Let me ask you a question.  Can somebody destroy their own house?  I was never given that piece of information.  I was told that the bulldozer had demolished the church, but at no time was I told that Father Seromba destroyed his own church. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE31.  In order to bring our examination to an end, I am going to ask you one or two questions, Witness FE31.  I would like to come back on the confessions that you made before the Gacaca courts, the confessions that you mentioned a moment ago.  And I would like to ask you the following question:  If during the attack of the 15th of April in which you participated, if Father Seromba had been one of the assailants, would you have hidden this information from the Gacaca courts during your confessions? 
A.	The truth be told, when you plead guilty, it means that you have something on your conscience and you have to confess.  We are talking about human life here.  I pleaded guilty, but that doesn't mean that I had to bring an allegation against somebody that I never saw present during the attack. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Do you think you have said everything that you know about the attack of the 15th?  Have you said all you know of that attack here before this Trial Chamber today? 
A.	Absolutely.  In all I have related to you, I have talked about the way the attack unfolded and the manner in which the bodies were buried.  I have also told you that on that day it rained and I returned home.  I have also said that I did not take part in the events that took place on following day the 16th -- on the following day, the 16th, but I heard of what happened on that day and I also said that I pleaded guilty of having taken part in the attack of the 15th April, and I made my confessions to the Rwandan government. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE31, for this clarification.  I would like to conclude by thanking you for coming here to enlighten the Trial Chamber with your testimony.  And on behalf of the Defence, we wish you a safe return trip to Rwanda, in spite of the delicate and fragile nature of your situation.  Thank you. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam President, Your Honours, this is where the Defence concludes its examination-in-chief, and the witness is now at the disposal of the Prosecution. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Nekuie.

Mr. Prosecutor, you may begin cross-examining the witness. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
Very much obliged, Your Honour. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION  
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  How are you?  
A.	I am very well, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Now, you are male Rwandan detainee of Hutu ethnicity; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And without saying the name of any places or school, can you tell us how many years of education you have had? 
A.	I attended primary school for six years.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness has just given the name of his school. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, don't translate.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	In 1994, were you a member of the MRND political party? 
A.	No, I was never involved in the business of political parties. 
Q.	Now, before coming to Arusha, how many times did you meet with members of Seromba's Defence? 
A.	While I was in Gitarama, there is a lady called Sylvie who came to see me.  She came on one occasion, and a few days later another lady came.  I can see her on the other side, so she came once.  And, later, the Defence counsel who was putting questions to me also came.  So, I would say that I have met them on three occasions.  They met me in Gitarama, and that was before I started appearing before the Gacaca courts in my country. 
Q.	How many statements would you have signed, if you recollect? 
A.	Sylvie asked for a copy of my confession which she took along with her.  She made a photocopy and brought back another copy to me, and I signed a declaration that I had two others. 
Q.	Let me try and be very specific.  How many statements for the Defence of Seromba have you signed? 
A.	I haven't signed any statement in this Seromba trial, apart from the statement that I gave to the 
	Defence counsel of Father Seromba. 
Q.	Now, the statement you gave to the Defence counsel, was that one statement, or any others? 
A.	I told you that I gave you a copy of my confessions -- my confession and I have said -- I told -- I said that I told it to others that I was ready to testify and I was going to add more details when I appear before this Tribunal. 
Q.	If you can listen more carefully to the question:  Was it typed or handwritten? 
A.	The document that I gave was written in my own handwriting and I signed it myself. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, are you talking about your confession, or are you talking of the statement that you gave to the Defence?  Can you be more -- can you be clearer? 
THE WITNESS:
I gave a copy of my confession to Sylvie, and that is the only document that I have given to them.  I did not know if they later translated the document I gave to them into French and which was in Kinyarwanda. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I think what the Prosecutor would like to know is the -- is whether you gave -- you signed a statement before the Defence representative. 
THE WITNESS:
They asked questions to me and I gave them oral answers and they were writing my answers down in writing after which I signed what was written down, and that was after they had asked me if I was ready to come and testify before this Trial Chamber.  It is after that that they wrote down what I told them orally. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Thank you for that clarification.  

Now, the document you have just mentioned you gave oral answers and they were written down and then you signed it, that document, was it a typed document by a typewriter, or was it a handwritten document that one the lawyers wrote? 
A.	The document that was shown to me was typed. 
Q.	And when did you put your signature on it? 
A.	I don't recall the precise date, but all I remember is that I signed the document. 
Q.	I would like to ask you now some questions about April 1994, if we can change the subject.  

Now, in April 1994, you would agree that Tutsi civilians were targeted and attacked, yes or no? 
A.	Yes, I do agree with you, they were chased.
Q.	My question is:  Were they targeted and attacked -- and I am asking, yes or no -- is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I agree. 
Q.	Now, the houses of Tutsi in Kivumu commune were burnt down after the 7th of April; is that correct, yes or no? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And as a result those Tutsis fled their homes, correct, yes or no? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Today you mentioned that Ndakubana's family was Tutsi.  Were those members of that family, in fact, killed, to your knowledge? 
A.	Yes, that is what I stated. 
Q.	And, today, you said that an agricultural assistant named Aloys was killed.  Was he a Tutsi? 
A.	The person wasn't Aloys.  It was the old Martin -- the old man Martin.
Q.	Do you happen to know the family name of that Martin? 
A.	His name was Karekezi.
MR. TOWNSEND:
I am not sure if the interpreter gave a spelling of Karekezi.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
K-A-R-E-K-E-Z-I.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness, that Karekezi, Martin, would have been a Tutsi who was killed; correct? 
A.	Yes, Martin was Tutsi and he was killed. 
Q.	Would you agree with me that Thomas Mwendenzi, that's, M-W-E-N-D-E-N-Z-I, Thomas Mwendenzi was also a Tutsi who was killed in those days following the death of the president? 
A.	I did not know that person.  It is possible that he lived in a different secteur, but I personally did not know him. 
Q.	Now, those Tutsi that fled to places seeking safety, some officials instructed them where to go.  Would you agree with that? 
A.	No, nobody told them where they had to go.  I have told you that in 1973, even though I was small, I was in first year of primary school, and I remember that Tutsi homes were burnt down and the Tutsis had sought refuge in churches, and after the events they returned to their homes.  So I would say that it was customary for them to go and seek refuge in churches, and that wasn't the first time they were doing so. 
Q.	Today, you testified that people brought them to the health centre in the commune.  Do you remember that testimony? 
A.	We were not led or taken to the health centre, except if they went to the health centre they were in the company of Rushema and they found us there at Mutanoga business centre.  We moved towards Nyange, so those people were coming or came from where Rushema had taken them and they found us at the centre and we went together to Nyange. 
Q.	My testimony -- my question is about your testimony about Tutsis that fled your area, and my understanding of your testimony is that you said that people brought some Tutsi to the health centre in the commune.  Do you remember that testimony or not? 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Objection from the Defence, Madam President.  I hope the Prosecutor -- I would like the Prosecutor to tell us in what part of his answer that he said so, because the Defence did not hear such an answer. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
I guess the objection is not necessarily the testimony and I am relying on my notes, Your Honour.  So, you'll have to arbitrate on that one. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
All the same, the Prosecutor hasn't told me if his notes are well taken down or not.  He has to take them down correctly. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, did you make such a statement here?  Did you hear the question that was put to you by the Prosecutor? 
THE WITNESS:
I didn't quite understand the question and, well, I appeal to you to invite the Prosecutor to repeat. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
I will rephrase and withdraw that question, Your Honour. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Would you agree with me that Tutsis, following the death of the president, were brought to the health centre in the commune? 
A.	I am not aware of people who were allegedly taken to the health centre.  I know that the communal authorities took certain persons to Nyange and those persons were already at the communal office and the communal authorities took them in a car towards -- to Nyange.
Q.	Thank you for that.  And when you say -- 
A.	And there was a certain Jean who was driving Musiramasirabo's car that took these persons to Nyange. 
Q.	That is a white Toyota Stout pickup truck; correct? 
A.	Yes, that is a vehicle, a white vehicle. 
Q.	You spoke earlier today about the bourgmestre, Ndahimana, the IPJ Kayishema being present and doing nothing in some crimes.  Can you tell us to which place you are referring? 
A.	It was at the communal office where the IPJ was living.  Ndahimana was living at Rokoko, but he witnessed those events while in the communal office. 
Q.	So the crimes to which you were referring at which the bourgmestre and Kayishema were present were at the location of the communal office.  Do I understand your testimony correctly? 
A.	There weren't any killings at the communal office, but people fled, moving towards the church, and that is where they were killed, but there were no killings at the communal office. 
Q.	Okay.  I am trying to understand your testimony.  When you said the bourgmestre and Kayishema were present, you are saying that they were at the commune office whilst crimes were occurring somewhere else within the commune; is that what you are saying? 
A.	When Kayishema and the IPJ were at the communal office, they were looking at the houses that were being burnt down and these houses were located not far from the communal office.  So they saw that houses were burning, in particular, this man who was living at the communal office's house, but I haven't said that there were killings at the communal office.
Q.	Can you tell us the name of the place where they would have been able to see the houses burning? 
A.	They witnessed the torching of the house of a certain Mutabera, and that was on Tuesday, the 12th.  I also talked about people who died before -- and they were informed about the killings of those ones, but I don't know if they carried out any investigations or not.  So, I am referring in particular to the death of Martin and to the death of members of the Ndakubana family, and so they continued to witness crimes that were being committed -- that were committed. 
Q.	Thank you.
MR. TOWNSEND:
If we can get an interpreter -- spelling of that name of that torched house?  
THE WITNESS:
The person was Donat Mutabera, his son, André Harerimana, and the parents of Father Silvére.  The house of the youth coordinator named Gatare, his house was also burnt down ******************.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	The last name you mentioned, Gatare, would that be Boniface Gatare?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, the French interpreter did not understand you or didn't hear you.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, sir, it was the same person, Boniface Gatare.  The interpreter in the booth says he didn't hear the Prosecutor.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Prosecutor was asking if it was, indeed, Boniface Gatare. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Madam President, it was Boniface Gatare who was the youth monitor - or, coordinator, and the assailants passed before his house.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Now, you have mentioned, I think, two roadblocks.  Did you see any other roadblocks around, let's say, the 15th of April 1994? 
A.	I talked about two roadblocks, but later other roadblocks were mounted. 
Q.	And did you happen, yourself, to see persons presenting ID cards which were checked by those manning the roadblocks and then they would proceed through those roadblocks? 
A.	I could not be aware of that because I was never present at any of the roadblocks.  I, therefore, wasn't witness of such event. 
Q.	So I understand that you saw roadblocks, but you never saw anyone go through them.  Is that your testimony? 
A.	I saw roadblocks, I saw people manning them. 
Q.	My question was: You never saw anyone pass through them; is that your testimony? 
A.	I told you that ************, that is, at ************, there was also a roadblock. 
Q.	Okay.  I am asking my question the third time now: yes or no, did you see anyone pass through any of those roadblocks? 
A.	Yes, people crossed those roadblocks. 
Q.	And you never saw anyone looking or asking for an ID card; is that your testimony? 
A.	There were roadblocks that had been mounted, particularly, at Mutanoga and Kubyapa.  There were people there who were asking passers -- those who were passing by them to show their identification papers, but I don't know what was being said because I wasn't present at the roadblock at the time they were asking people to produce or show their identification papers.
Q.	I thank you for that.
MR. TOWNSEND:
I am going to move on to a new subject at this time, Your Honour.  I am not sure if you want to take a break at such time? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we think it is appropriate to take the lunch break at this point.  We will be resuming proceedings at 2:30 p.m. 

Thank you to everyone, and the proceedings stand adjourned. 
(Court recessed from 1231H to 1433H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is called to order.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. 

Good afternoon, Witness.  The Prosecutor will continue with the cross-examination.  You are still under oath, of course. 

Prosecutor, you may now proceed. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you, Your Honours. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness FE31, I'd just like to remind you we are in open session, and I'd like to add that I have a long series of questions, most of which you will be able to answer yes, no, I don't know or I don't remember, and if you are going to explain only when you need to.  Do you understand? 
A.	Yes, I do, Prosecutor. 
Q.	You did not go to Nyange church from 11th to 14th April 1994; correct? 
A.	No, I did not go to Nyange church.
Q.	Did you attend the burial of that well-known doctor to which you testified in your direct examination? 
A.	No, I did not attend the burial of the doctor. 
Q.	What day of the week is market day in Nyange? 
A.	The Nyange market holds on Saturdays. 
Q.	Now, with regard to the 15th of April 1994, the attackers at Nyange were Hutus; is that correct? 
A.	That is right, yes. 
Q.	And those Hutu attackers on the 15th of April 1994 numbered in the thousands, would you agree? 
A.	They were a lot of them. 
Q.	If you were to estimate the number of Hutu attackers present at Nyange on the 15th April 1994, would you agree that they would number in the thousands? 
A.	More than 5,000. 
Q.	Now, without saying names, you testified that your neighbours went to Nyange church and died there. Were those neighbours Tutsi? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And the other victims you personally saw on the 15th of April were Tutsi, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You testified that certain well-known Tutsis at Nyange on the 15th of April 1994 were specifically sought.  Does that mean that they were targeted to be killed? 
A.	Yes, they were killed in that month. 
Q.	And they were killed specifically on the 15th of April 1994.  You made those observations? 
A.	Well, to talk about people who were sought, only Gatare was killed on that day. 
Q.	Is it your evidence that other well-known Tutsis were sought or targeted on that day you were present? Did you come to learn that? 
A.	I was there on the 15th. 
Q.	And having been there on 15th, did you come to learn that other Tutsis that were well known, besides Anicet Gatare were sought after or targeted at Nyange? 
A.	Others were also killed, but I don't know whether they were killed on the spot or there were some survivors who were subsequently killed somewhere else, maybe where they went to seek refuge.  The fact is they all died because I didn't see them again and I never heard any mention made of them. 
Q.	On 15th April 1994 you arrived at Nyange centre at about 10 a.m.; correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You were not wearing a watch; correct? 
A.	No, I wasn't wearing a watch, it is an estimate and approximation. 
Q.	Now, you testified that you did not know about any meetings, planning what you have called the war, because such meetings would have been held in secret.  Do you recall that testimony? 
A.	That is correct, that was my evidence. 
Q.	Now, if you had arrived at 10:30 at Nyange centre, you would agree with me that you would not have seen any meetings that would have taken place prior or before your arrival? 
A.	If a meeting had taken place at Nyange, I would have been a witness. 
Q.	Now, if that meeting took place before you arrived at 10:30, you would not have seen it; do you agree? 
A.	Well, if there were -- if a meeting had taken place, it would have been led by the IPJs, but I think they held their own meeting by the roadside, on the road to the convent.  They must have had their meeting prior to my arrival. 
Q.	Now, the place where you said you saw people circled up and meeting later to which you have just made reference, would that have been near a place called Codecoki?  I will spell that.  It is C-O-D-E-C-O-K-I? 
A.	Yes, that would be the place. 
Q.	And what you have testified as the monument Virgin Mary is also just a few metres away from Codecoki; is that correct? 
A.	On the house of the sisters was on the right-hand side, that is, on the road that goes to the parish, and it is the house that is close to the church, or the last house before the church. 
Q.	I am not sure if you understood my question.  My question is about a statue, a monument of Virgin Mary often referred to as Ishushu (phonetic); isn't that place close to Codecoki? 
A.	Indeed, yes, Codecoki is located behind the Virgin Mary's statue, a monument.  
Q.	In fact, just a few metres behind Ishushu, correct? 
A.	Well, the premises - or, the courtyard behind the statue belongs to Codecoki. 
Q.	Now, you testified that Kayishema, communal police, businessmen and others made a circle and discussed before the attack, but you did not hear those words; is that correct? 
A.	Indeed, I didn't hear what they discussed. 
Q.	Can you name any other persons that were in that circle of discussion? 
A.	I talked about the businessman, the IPJ of the communal policeman, Kayishema.  I also talked about Anasthase Rushema.  I spoke of Leonard Abayisenga; there was Théophile and the others.  I didn't move close to them because of that businessman.  ****************************************************************. 
Q.	I was wondering if we could get the name of Abayisenga spelt for the record, if that is possible? 
A.	The name is Abayisenga, and that is spelt A-B-A-Y-I-S-E-N-G-A, Abayisenga.  
Q.	Thank you very much.  Now, when you say Théophile, you are referring to the reservist also known as Rukara as being in that discussion; is that correct? 
A.	Indeed, yes.
Q.	How many grenades, in total, did Rukara subsequently throw, was it two or more than two?
A.	There was one grenade that was thrown at the person who was on the road.  He came out of the house, ran after that person and then threw a second grenade.  So those are the grenades that I saw being thrown.  
Q.	So by my count, you witnessed two grenades exploding on the 15th of April 1994.
A.	Yes, two grenades were thrown, well, in my presence. 
Q.	Did you notice any other reserve officers in that discussion, yes or no?
A.	There were a lot of them.  There was Boniface Kabalisa, there was Ephrem, the son of Nzabigerageza; and then some other people whose names are not known to me, but there were a lot of them. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
I am not sure whether we can burden the Kinyarwanda booth to try and spell those names. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness talked of Kabalisa, and Kabalisa is spelt K-A-B-A-L-I-S-A, Kabalisa.  He also spoke of Nzabigerageza and that is spelt N-Z-A-B-I-G-E-R-A-G-E-Z-A. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Do I understand that you would like to tell us the name of that businessman in closed session, or are you able to do that now? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(No interpretation)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, please, the witness just said that he would be prepared to mention the name in closed session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, maybe he can put it in writing on a piece of paper, if all the other questions can be put to him in open session. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam President, I would have wanted that he put it down in writing on a piece of paper, and that would be reasonable for purposes of his protection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, could you give a piece of paper to the witness?  

Or did you have some other proposal?  Did you still have any further questions to ask in closed session, Prosecutor? 
MR. TOWNSEND:
I do have questions later for closed, and I could come back to this.  I am of the view that we should try and spare the Chamber as much paper as possible, but I see he is already writing, so we can do it right now. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let me ask the question again.  Earlier on, the witness talked of ***************************************************************************.  Is that not likely to reveal his identity, I mean the identity of the witness?  
MR. TOWNSEND:
If that pleases the Chamber, I would so move. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So let that portion dealing with ***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************. 

You may proceed, Prosecutor. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
I would also ask that the record reflect that the document be admitted as the next Prosecutor exhibit, then, for purposes of the record.
MR. MUSSA:
Your Honours, it is P. 43. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No objection from the Defence counsel?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
None, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Document bearing the number P. 43 is placed under seal. 
It is admitted as Prosecution exhibit.
(Exhibit No. P. 43 admitted, under seal) 
MR. TOWNSEND:
I thank you, Your Honours. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Now, with regard to that discussion, did you see Bourgmestre Gregoire Ndahimana present or not? 
A.	At that point in time, the bourgmestre wasn't there. 
Q.	You testified today that the Astaldi trucks brought people to Nyange.  How many trucks, can you describe them? 
A.	They rotated and there were a lot of them, and I am not in a position to give you the exact number. 
Q.	When you say that these Astaldi trucks rotated, you mean they would arrive at Nyange, unload the passengers and then repeat this process? 
A.	They rotated and they transported people and dropped them off literally, and then came back for some more. 
Q.	Now, some of those passengers in the Astaldi trucks, you would agree with me, were members of the Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes, they were; they were Interahamwe. 
Q.	Today, you testified that during the attack of 15th April 1994 "we hacked".  Does that include you doing hacking? 
A.	I told you that I was there, but I didn't wound anybody with cutting instruments.  I didn't have a machete, but I did take part - or, I was there and I observed the scene and the person that was with me did use a cutting instrument in order to hack people. 
Q.	Well, I will come back to the person who accompanied you.  But with regard to you, did you carry anything in your hands, or did you go to Nyange empty-handed? 
A.	I said that I left to get some water, but I was actually taken by force and didn't have any arm or weapon.  All I did, in fact, was to pick up a few stones and I put them in my pocket.
Q.	Did you throw stones? 
A.	Yes, I did throw stones, but in view of the fact that we were very numerous, those people who were in front of us carried on throwing stones, but I stayed back a little because, as you can understand, I couldn't throw stones in view of the fact that there were plenty of other people in front of me in my group. 
Q.	How many stones did you throw? 
A.	I can't give you an exact number.  I can't tell you how many stones I threw.  I think that you would also find it difficult to give a number.  I didn't count the number of stones that I threw on that day. 
Q.	I understand you didn't count, but did you throw less than five, more than 10; could you give us an estimate?
MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam President, I think that the witness gave a very clear answer to this question, and I don't see any point in the Prosecution harbouring the point. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think, Counsel Nekuie, that we should avoid such interruptions.  We need to know whether he can give an estimate, and if he can, he will do so, and if he can't, he won't, but, of course, that makes us lose time.  Witness, can you answer the question asked by the Prosecution? 
THE WITNESS:
Madam President, I didn't count the number of stones that I threw.  I threw stones at targets that were at a considerable distance away and there were also people in front of me, within my group.  So I can't give you a precise number of stones that I threw. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The question that was asked of you was not to give the exact number of stones that you threw, but to give an estimate, an approximate figure, if possible. 
THE WITNESS:
I wouldn't be able to tell you exactly how many stones I threw.  What I did do was pick up stones and give them to people who were standing in front of us.  In order to answer your question, I didn't throw more than five stones. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Thank you for that.  You've just said that you threw stones at targets.  Is it your testimony that you threw stones at human beings; that is correct?  
A.	Yes, I did. 
Q.	In fact, Tutsi with the intent to injury them; correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you targeted those people because they were Tutsi; correct? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	Now, you testified that the Tutsi locked themselves up inside Nyange church, following the grenades blast.  Do I understand that those church doors were then barricaded from inside to prevent the attackers from gaining entry? 
A.	Yes, the doors were closed from the inside. 
Q.	Now, at some point you saw Ndahimana present at Nyange on the 15th of April 1994; is that correct? 
A.	I didn't see Ndahimana on the 15th at Nyange.  He had gone to a burial, the burial of the doctor.  I had seen him before that date in the commune on the 12th, for example, when there was an attack.
Q.	How about Councillor Jean-Marie Vianney Habarugira, did you see him on the 15th of April 1994 at Nyange? 
A.	We were together. 
Q.	What would you say to the proposition that you told the Defence that you saw Bourgmestre Ndahimana when you arrived at Nyange church? 
A.	Maybe I made a mistake when I talked to the Defence, because I didn't see Ndahimana that day, but I did see the businessman that I mentioned earlier. 
Q.	Now, when you first arrived at Nyange on the 15th of April 1994, I thought you said about 10:30, you went straight to the Ishusho, the Virgin Marry statue; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is where we were standing. 
Q.	Later Anicet Gatare was killed and his body was undressed up near the church while you were down at the Virgin Marry statue; is that correct? 
A.	When he was killed, I was at the Virgin Statue, and Rushema told me that Gatare had just been killed.
Q.	And -- (inaudible) 
A.	But I didn't see his body. 
Q.	And you understood the location where Anicet Gatare's body laid undressed was close to the church; is that correct? 
A.	I never heard that he had been undressed. 
Q.	Now, you testified that you went up near the Nyange church courtyard.  For how many minutes did you remain there up in the courtyard on the 15th of April 1994? 
A.	I stayed there for a short time because there were explosions and there was gunshots, and that is why I went down again towards the school.
Q.	If I recall -- 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
In fact, sorry, correction from the Kinyarwanda booth -- towards the statue. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Do I recall your testimony that you said that, in fact, you were frightened by those gunshots and that's what caused you to run away from the courtyard and return to the Virgin Mary statue? 
A.	Yes, I took flight.  I was frightened of that gunshot. 
Q.	Now, we are going to ask you again.  Can you estimate -- we know you didn't have a watch, but can you give us a number of minutes as an estimate you would have spent near the church courtyard in what you described as a short time? 
A.	I didn't stay there for longer than 10 minutes. 
Q.	So in that period of time less than 10 minutes that you were near the church courtyard, did you at any time on the 15th of April 1994 enter the presbytery, in other words, within the walls of the parish? 
A.	No, I didn't go into the presbytery. 
Q.	Now, did you come to learn that Rukara, the military reservist who threw the two grenades at the Tutsi, was part of the strategy to lure the Tutsi down and attack them at that vulnerable moment by surprise? 
A.	When he held the grenade, he was standing in front of the statue.  So he threw the grenade and took them by surprise, because he had gone up on to the roof of a house and, from there, he had thrown the grenade. 
Q.	Just to clarify what you have said, when he threw a grenade from on top of the building, was that the first or second grenade? 
A.	He threw the first grenade when he was on the rooftop, and the second grenade was thrown when he had already come down again. 
Q.	So did you or didn't you hear that that was part of a strategy to lure out the Tutsi and attack them while they were most exposed? 
A.	It wasn't a trap, because the first assailants -- and there were other assailants who were also picking up stones in order to hand them over to those who were throwing them, so that meant there was nobody else down there, apart from the assailants. 
Q.	You have mentioned soldiers and shooting taking place during the attack of 15th April.  Do you specifically remember gendarmes also participating? 
A.	The gendarmes were no longer there when we led our attack.  We attacked them and the refugees were weakened and there was nothing they could do to confront the Interahamwe. 
Q.	So, yes or no, did you see gendarmes shoot on the 15th of April 1994? 
A.	No, I didn't see them shoot. 
Q.	What would you say to the proposition that you told the Defence that the gendarmes shot at those that were fleeing and entered the presbytery? 
A.	I didn't say that it was gendarmes who shot at the refugees; I said it was policemen and reservists who were with Rukara.  They were the ones who chased after them and shot at them. 
Q.	You have mentioned reservists several times now, and you have also mentioned that this was a war.  Was it your understanding that these reservists had been activated and were active soldiers at the time you saw them on the 15th of April? 
A.	Yes, they were active soldiers. 
Q.	I would like to ask you about some weapons on the 15th of April 1994.  Did you see anyone attempt to spray petrol or fuel on the church, itself? 
A.	On that day, I didn't see anybody doing that, but I heard people say that people had brought fuel, but I wasn't an eyewitness to the event.  It could have happened after the rainfall. 
Q.	Did you see any agricultural or other type of sprayers with your own eyes?  
A.	No, I didn't see anything like that.
Q.	Did you see anyone attempt to use dynamite or explosives on the doors or other parts of Nyange church on the 15th of April? 
A.	As far as dynamite is concerned, that only happened afterwards, when I was no longer there.  People say that it did happen and that if -- fuel was even brought to the place, but that was when I was not there. 
Q.	Did you see anyone make or use a ladder, handmade of wood, on that 15th of April 1994 as part of an attack against the church? 
A.	Are you talking about a ladder made of wood?  No, I didn't see anybody use a ladder made of wood. 
Q.	Did you hear that that might have happened after your departure on the 15th of April? 
A.	People say that the event during which dynamite and fuel were brought happened after I had left. 
Q.	The same for ladders? 
A.	Yes, that is right. 
Q.	Would you agree that authorities like Ndahimana and Kayishema were involved in bringing the bulldozer to Nyange on the 15th of April 1994? 
A.	I can confirm that Kayishema and Rushema, yes, but Ndahimana was not there.  The bulldozer that buried those people who died on the 15th was brought by Rushema and was driven by Albert.  
	He was the one who buried the victims on that day.  Ndahimana was not there; Albert was from Zaire. 
Q.	What would you say to the proposition that you told the Defence that after the killings of 15th April 1994, Bourgmestre Ndahimana and Kayishema requisitioned a bulldozer to bury the bodies on the -- Friday, the 15th? 
A.	Maybe it is a mistake.  The other bulldozers arrived after the church had been demolished and the authorities brought them there in order to bury those people who had been killed on the 16th.  Otherwise, I told them that Ndahimana brought the bulldozers in order to bury those people who had been killed on the second occasion. 
Q.	Can you, again, tell us the time which you estimated that you left on the 15th, that is, when you went from Nyange towards your home? 
A.	You want to know how long I spent at Nyange?  Well, I arrive there at approximately 10:30 and I left between 3:30 and 4:00 in the afternoon.  I left when it started to rain. 
Q.	Now, what would you say to the proposition that if the fuel sprayers and dynamite and use of ladders occurred before 3:30, that you would have left earlier than the time you have estimated? 
A.	I gave you an estimate of the time because I wasn't wearing a watch, but it was at approximately that time.  I don't know whether the incidents happened when I was near the statue.  So, I said to you that it rained between 3:00 and four o'clock. 
Q.	Now, let me see if I understand your testimony.  You are telling the Court that you came to Nyange centre at about 10:30.  You threw less than five stones, for about less than 10 minutes.  You would have gone up towards the church until at least 3:30.  You would have remained at -- near the statue of Virgin Mary, and you spent that whole time just observing? 
A.	After having held the grenade, I then went to a banana plantation that belonged to the father and I stayed there for a while.  And when I came back, I met Rushema who told us that Gatare had just been killed.  He carried on his way in order to go and get a bulldozer and I went to the statue of the 
	Virgin Marry and I stayed there. 
Q.	Did I understand from your last response that you, personally, held the grenade, or did I misunderstand? 
A.	No, if somebody said that, that is not true.  I didn't hold it; he held it. 
Q.	I am trying to understand now the places you were on the 15th.  You were by the statue.  You came up to the courtyard for less than 10 minutes.  Now you have mentioned a banana plantation.  How many minutes did you spend there? 
A.	I didn't stay there for very long.  I went back to the -- behind (sic). 
Q.	So I put it to you that they were thousands of people and that Seromba was present, but you didn't see him in your brief period of time that you were near the church.  What do you say to that? 
A.	Well, if I didn't see him, that doesn't mean to say that other people didn't see him. 
Q.	How many bulldozers did you see on the 15th of April 1994? 
A.	I didn't understand your question.
Q.	Did you see one bulldozer or two bulldozers on the 15th of April, or how many? 
A.	I only saw one bulldozer. 
Q.	Now, the next day, the 16th of April 1994, you followed the instructions of Conseiller Habarugira to keep three cows.  Did I understand that correctly? 
A.	Yes, that is what happened. 
Q.	These cows had been stolen from Tutsi.  Is that your understanding? 
A.	I don't know where those cows had come from. 
Q.	Now, you said that those cows were given as a reward to attackers.  Those three cows were given to the attackers to eat for having participated in the attack on the 16th April 1994?  
A.	Yes, from Kibilira. 
Q.	Now, you mentioned an estate, which I presume, is land.  Was that given also as a reward, to your knowledge? 
(Pages 29 to 45 by Sithembiso Moyo)




























1530H
THE WITNESS:
I only heard that during the population (inaudible) who were accusing Ruzirabwoba at Gacaca court sessions.  I only heard that during the Gacaca court sessions, members of the population were accusing Ruzirabwoba, saying that he was the first person to have received a reward for having killed people, and that he received a plot of land, but that was of no concern to me, but I heard that during a Gacaca court session that I took part in.  He was also present when we appeared before the court. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	And you did not receive a reward from Habarugira because you did not participate in the attack of 16th of April; correct? 
A.	He didn't give me any reward despite the fact that I asked for one, but when I asked he told me off and cut me down to size and so I gave up on the idea. 
Q.	So it is your testimony that you threw less than five stones, and that you had asked for a reward which was based on participating in the attack?  
A.	I acknowledge or acknowledged having taken part in the attack on Friday, but I didn't know that the next day cows were going to be given to those people as a reward -- 
Q.	My question is slightly different -- 
A.	-- I was obliged to keep hold of them. 
Q.	My question is slightly different.  It's your evidence that you only threw five stones, but you still asked for a reward; is that your evidence?  
A.	That is not what I said.  

I said that I asked for a reward for having tended the cows, and not for having thrown less than five stones. 
Q.	I thought I'd just asked you a minute ago if you were denied your reward because you did not participate in the attack on the 16th, and you agreed to that.  And now you're saying that it was based on your cow tending.  I'm confused.  
A.	No.  I did not say that, I told you that I asked for a reward for having tended the cows on the 16th.  I never asked for a reward for having thrown stones, but from whom would I have asked for a reward?  We were coerced into going to participate in the attack.  How could I, therefore, have claimed or asked for a reward?
Q.	Witness, I am even more confused because a moment ago you said you asked Habarugira for a reward; isn't that correct? 
A.	Yes, I do agree I asked for a reward from Harbarugira, on the 16th, since I had tended the cows. 
Q.	I'm going to move on to something else now.  You testified today under solemn declaration to tell the truth and you've said you attacked the Tutsis on the 15th of April.  And do you remember saying, nobody ever compelled you to confess your crimes? 
A.	Nobody compelled me to do so.
Q.	And in response to Counsel Nekuie's question you said you gave details of your participation in your confession; is that true? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And is it true when you said you would not have hidden information when testifying? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Is it true, today, when you said words to the effect of "When one is guilty you have to confess, we are talking about human life.  I pleaded guilty."? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	So is it your evidence that you always told the truth when giving information or a statement or talking to authorities? 
A.	Yes, I am only speaking the truth.  There is no lie in my statements. 
MR. TOWNSEND: 
With the help of the registry, I would like to refer the witness to a statement which appears to be this witness's statement of the 18th of December 2001 -- if it can be shown to the Defence, I have provided them a copy earlier.  It is a one-page document to the Rwandan authorities.  I'll give references here: the French is K036O433; the Kinyarwanda is K0344090.  There's no English translation. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND: 
Q.	Now, Witness, I see that both the French and the Kinyarwanda have been presented to you.  Can you flip to the second page -- which is the Kinyarwanda version -- and look at the signature at the bottom of that page, please?  

I see you flipped to the Kinyarwanda page.  Can you confirm, yes or no, that that is your signature that appears on that half-page statement, dated 18th December 2001? 
A.	It is, indeed, my signature.  
Q.	Now, that half page in Kinyarwanda, is handwritten.  Is that your own hand or did someone write that for you?  I see you are reading the document.  My question does not require you to read the whole document.  I'm asking you did you write it with your own hand? 
A.	It is my handwriting. 
Q.	And you told the truth when you wrote that statement; correct?  

If you could stop reading, and answer my question, please. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, if you're asking him if he really spoke the truth, probably you should let him read the document so that he can ascertain whether it was really the document that he wrote.  He has recognised his signature, but he may not be aware of the contents.  

MR. TOWNSEND:
I will withdraw the question.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:  
Q.	And tell me when you are done reading the statement.
A.	I recognise the contents of this document.  This is, indeed, a document that I, myself, produced.
Q.	Thank you, for that.  My question, now, to you is with reference to the last sentence.  And I'm going to read it in English.  The interpreters have it in French.  If you could follow with me in Kinyarwanda, "As to the events that took place in Nyange church, I don't know anything, because I didn't go there and all my neighbours know that."  That is what that sentence reads; correct? 
A.	I am somewhat confused by what is written in this document, but I do recognise I have acknowledged having been to the church on the 15th, but I have said I didn't return there on the 16th. 
Q.	Can you read the last sentence, then, aloud?  It looks like it starts with "Nahoi"? 
A.	As far as this document is concerned, I don't know where this copy was taken from.  In the documents that I wrote I said that on the 15th I was in Nyange, and that I did not know what happened on the 16th because I didn't go back there.  And, therefore, I do not understand the reason wherefore what I have said has been varied.  Here it is said that I don't know what happened at the church, but, I did say that did not go back there on the 16th and, therefore, I am unable to talk about events that took place there on that date.  
Q.	Thank you for that.  But my request to you was to read aloud the last sentence for us. Can you do that now?  If I can interrupt you, just the last sentence that begins N-A-H-O-I, nahoi.  Can you keep reading aloud? 
A.	As to the events that occurred at the Nyange church, I know nothing about them.  I don't know the events that occurred in Nyange on the 16th, because I did not go there.  I am not aware of what happened on the 16th because I did not go there, and, by the way, that is what I said.  But I do acknowledge what happened on the 15th.  Indeed, what I wanted to say was that I was not aware of what happened on the 16th because I did not go there on that date? 
Q.	Okay.  You've just given us an explanation, but can you please read just that sentence, so everyone in the court can understand what you wrote in just that last sentence, please? 
A.	I would like to insist to say that I have acknowledged the events.  I've acknowledged, now, the events that occurred on the 15th.  Furthermore, I never gave a copy to this Defence Counsel.  I gave a copy, instead, to a certain Rutoko and he asked me to give a written statement concerning those cows.  And I see that you have handed to me that document, and I do acknowledge having said this, but I also said that I did not go back to Nyange on the 16th, and the members of the population know this.  

Are you insisting on the fact that I knew nothing of what happened in that church?  That is not true.  I have said I acknowledge the events that occurred there on the 15th, but I did not go there on the 16th. 
Q.	Do I understand from your long explanation that a truthful statement depends on to whom you give it? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Wait a minute, Mr. Witness.  

Mr. Nekuie, you may address the Court. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, I would want to raise an objection here, I should have done so for some time, because the document that the Prosecutor has been giving to the witness is a document in which he talks about the events of the 16th, and this is written down.  I do not know, therefore, why the Prosecutor wants to lead the witness or to have him admit that he is talking about all of the events of Nyange in this document.  I think it is all written down and it is clear. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
I withdraw the question, Your Honours. 

But I would just ask, having asked three times for the witness to read the last sentence, that we call upon the Kinyarwanda interpreter in the booth to read the last sentence of that statement so that we can get a true interpretation.  
BY MR. TOWNSEND: 
Q.	With all due respect, Witness, this isn't a question --
A.	You should let me read the document from the beginning of the passage.  
MR. TOWNSEND: 
I thank you for that request.  

This is my cross, Your Honours.  I have a request before you for the interpreter to read the last sentence.  If you could so instruct the interpreter. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecutor, I think in that case, the entire document will have to be read, because everything seems to stick -- to tally.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
With all due respect, Your Honours, this is fair game for re-cross, but this is my cross-examination.  I'm only putting this one sentence to the witness.  I asked the witness three times to read the sentence and he would not.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Nekuie.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, I wish, respectfully, to -- to be opposed to the request made by the Prosecutor.  He has given a document to the witness, and he wants the witness to recognise only a portion of that document and read it out.  I think this is a request that is unfair.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We would like to ask the question to the Kinyarwanda booth; have you already given a translation of that last sentence on that?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
Yes, Madam President, the interpreter has already translated it. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
If that is the case, I will move to the next statement, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Prosecutor.
MR. TOWNSEND:
I would like to refer, with the help of the registry, and after the document has been shown to the Defence, that they already have a copy -- it is a one-page Kinyarwanda document which appears to be this witness's statement of 14th January 2000, to Rwandan authorities.  And I'll read the references while it is being circulated.  For the record, Your Honours, this is Kinyarwanda original K0344107; French translation K035941629418 (sic) three pages; English translation is K0366731, two pages.  And a copy now appears to have been put before the witness, again. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND: 
Q.	If you could just look at the last page which is in Kinyarwanda, and answer us if that is your statement with a thumbprint; yes or no?  
A.	I do not recognise this document.  I do not know its provenance. 
Q.	Would you agree with me that on the third line without saying anything, i.e., your name aloud, that your name appears on that? 
A.	No.  I do not see my name on this document.  No, I have not seen where my name appears. 
Q.	Do you see your name on the third line -- line three? 
A.	Yes, I have identified my name. 
Q.	And that document shows that you were the person appearing to give that statement; correct? 
A.	I can't recall where I was when I answered those questions. 
Q.	If you look in the top left-hand corner, you'd agree that the venue would have been the parquet de la république, Kibuye; would you agree?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Nekuie. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, I think the witness has already told the Prosecutor that he does not recognise the document.  So the Prosecutor should have him admit the - or, acknowledge or recognise the document before putting questions to him on the document. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
The witness started with "I never" and then stopped. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you wanted to say something.  Please proceed. 
THE WITNESS:
I wish to make some comments on this document:  I was detained in 1995 -- that is on the 24th of June 1994.  In Nyange there was no figure of authority apart from a certain Kimeni.  No case file was prepared, so when I was transferred to Kibuye I had no case file and I stayed in Kibuye for four years and a half.  

I was then taken to the council of judges, which council released me.  And, I, therefore, returned home and I was there for two weeks and then I was re-arrested.  I spent two years at the communal prison. The IPG (sic), therefore, never prepared any case file on me and I was transferred to the Gisovu prison.  And when I got there I stayed there for a year, and was later transferred to Gitarama.  

It was in Gitarama that I was interviewed by a deputy prosecutor, who informed me that he had seen the document that contained my confession.  He put questions to me to find out why I was pleading guilty and I gave him explanations.  Therefore, he said, "Well, that was fine -- we had noticed that no file had been prepared against you, with the exception of the order issued by the council of judges."  And he asked me to appear before the Gacaca sessions or to go to a communal level.  If I have to return to this document, I would say that I did not recognise it, because I was never interviewed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Probably we are going to take the short break now, and when we resume proceedings we will look at that document again.  So the Court stands adjourned for a few minutes 
(Court recessed from 1600H to 1625H)  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, could you proceed with the cross-examination. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you, Your Honours.  
BY MR. TOWNSEND:  
Q.	Witness, FE31, during the break have you had an opportunity to look at that document dated 14 January 2000; yes, or no? 
A.	Yes, I looked at it. 
Q.	And if you can look specifically at the document while I am asking you these questions.  In the top left corner, you would agree that that was taken at the parquet or prosecutor's office in Kibuye; correct? 
A.	That is correct, yeah.  

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
That was the answer of the witness. 
MR. NEKUIE:
The Defence has already objected to the use of that document.  One thing, it is not proven that the witness has recognised that document.  I don't see how the Prosecutor can proceed with cross-examination on the third document.  He must somehow make the witness admit that he recognises that document.  I mean it is not his fingerprint at the bottom of the document.
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
Thank you, Mr. Nekuie. 

What's your reply, Prosecutor?  
MR. TOWNSEND:
If the witness can take off his headset, please?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
Now I am trying to let -- thank you, Your Honours.  I see the witness has taken his headset off.  I'm trying to lay the foundation to authenticate this document, although authentication is not a requirement of Rule 89.  I'd appreciate if Counsel -- if he'd make such objection outside of the presence of the witness.  He seems to be making statements, including giving evidence from the Bar, with regard to the authenticity of a thumbprint in front of the witness.  It is highly inappropriate.  Those are my submissions, Your Honour.  I should like to proceed to lay the foundation for this document. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Nekuie. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President and Your Honours, I merely wish to point out to the Prosecutor that he has shown the photocopy of a document to the witness on which his thumbprint is supposed to be -- to appear.  So this objection doesn't need to be raised in the absence of the witness, particularly as the witness says he does not recognise the document.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, you may proceed. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
I note there is no question to the witness, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, that's true.  One moment, please.  You haven't yet asked a question, but the witness did raise his hand in order to address the Court, and that is why we have given him time to express himself. 

Witness, you may proceed. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.  If I refer to the witness statement of the 14th of January 2000, the reason why I do not recognise this document is that I have never read this document.  

I was released on the *************** in 1999 in Kibuye.  And I note that on this document is noted the 14th of January, the year 2000.  So I would like to ask whether this document comes from the commune or whether it is the prosecutor -- the public prosecutor of Kibuye who actually interviewed me, because I do not recognise this document. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
That was my question to you, and I'll retake it up, again.
BY MR. TOWNSEND: 
Q.	In the top left-hand corner, if you look at that document dated 14 January 2000, which you have told us you have now read, would you agree that it says, "The parquet or the prosecutor in Rwanda" -- if there is going to be any objection, I would ask --
MR. NEKUIE:
Objection, Your Honour.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you going to ask us a question of a legal nature, Counsel?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, it is a question of a legal nature, Madam President.  

The admissibility of this document has been made before the Court, and we did not receive a response to it before the Prosecutor continued.  Before this document becomes an item of discussion between the two parties, I do not see how he can pursue his re-examination on that issue.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We're going to let the witness address the Court.  I think the problem was to know whether he had appended his fingerprint.  

Do you recognise this document?  Of course, he can't hear me he hasn't got his headset on.  

Witness, on the left-hand side of this document there is, apparently, a fingerprint.  Did you fingerprint this document or a document on that date?  
THE WITNESS:
No.  I have never seen this document and I never did that.  I know that I never fingerprinted any document.  I always use my signature, so it is a false document, and I don't know where it comes from.  It is, indeed, a forgery.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What do you have to say, Prosecutor?  
MR. TOWNSEND:
That I've not yet moved it into evidence and I intend to keep asking questions.  I'd also admit that Defence Exhibit 13 admitted -- on the 4th of October 2004 was admitted, although the Prosecutor's witness did not recognise the document as his own, but I will get to that argument if I seek to move it in.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What is your question, Prosecutor?  
MR. TOWNSEND:
If I can proceed, I'm happy to, Your Honour. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND: 
Q.	My question, which I'll repeat now for the third time is; in the top left-hand corner you'd agree this document reads, "From the parquet or the prosecutor in Kibuye", yes or no? 
A.	Yes, that is what I can read.  
Q.	And you've already said that your name appears on the third line.  The name at the bottom of the page, you would agree with me is a Télesphore Dukuzumeuremyi, D-U-K-U-Z-U-M-E-U-R-E-M-Y-I; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	That is the person you named just a few minutes ago as being the OPJ or IPG on your case at that time; is that correct? 
A.	Are you talking about the public prosecutor's office in Kibuye or are you talking about the communal prison, Prosecutor?  
Q.	I'm talking about the parquet, and I'm talking about the name you mentioned just a few minutes ago. 
A.	Télesphore worked at the communal office.  He didn't work for the public prosecutor's office in Kibuye.  His office was at the commune. 
Q.	And do you know the last name of that Télesphore? 
A.	The OPJ (as interpreted) who worked at the communal office was called "Télesphore".  I don't actually know his surname, and I don't know whether he was called Dukuzumeuremyi. 
Q.	Let me ask you if in the first question it mentions your cellule, is that correct; if you can answer just yes or no? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And were you, in fact, ever deposed or giving a statement in January 2000; yes, or no? 
A.	I never gave a statement during that period.  I made a statement on the 18th of December 2001, and I was interviewed by Rutoko who had left Kibuye in order to come and see me in the communal prison.  So I don't know where the document that I have before me actually comes from.  He came to see me when I had left Kibuye -- I had been released and when I -- when I arrived, I was placed in detention and Rutoko interviewed me on the -- on what happened to the cows.  However, in the year 2000 I was never interviewed when I was at the commune.  The OPJ did not interview me during that period. 
Q.	So is it your testimony that you never gave a statement on the 14th of January 2000; yes or no? 
A.	No. 
Q.	I'd like you to look at what is the sixth question, and I'm going to read it aloud to you, if you can follow with me, although it is not numbered in Kinyarwanda.  It is actually -- if you're with me -- it's question six.  Are you - 'You are accused of having participated -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please ask your question in view of the fact the majority has accepted that you pursue. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	I am reading what appears to be question six in the translations: "You are accused of having participated in the bloody attack on the church.  That was in broad daylight and many people saw you.  What is your response?"  Answer: "It is a pure lie.  I never went there."  

	Did you follow that?  Do you see that appearing in that document before you? 
A.	I told you that I do not recognise this document.  I do not recognise it.  And I told you that I was at first released and then I was detained once again.  Télesphore never interviewed me, so you should not base yourselves on this document.  I went back to Gisovu and the members of the public prosecutor's office came and told Télesphore that they had released me.  So was I, once again, detained.  Those people who came from Kibuye told him that they thought I was free, and Télesphore never interviewed me.  So it is fabrication, in the sense that that person never interviewed me. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(No interpretation)
THE WITNESS:  
If that person had interviewed me, this document would have then been produced before the Gacaca courts where I appeared. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	I'd like you to follow what is the answer to question seven, in that document: Answer:  "I never went to the church.  If I had gone there, people would have seen me."  

	Didn't you make that statement on 14th January 2000? 
A.	I never made such a statement. 
Q.	With the help of the registry, I'd like you to look at a document that appears to be a statement of 19 November 1999.  It is a one-page document.  
MR. TOWNSEND: 
The Defence have been served a copy; the interpreters have a copy.  For the record, Your Honour, the reference is for this document of 19 November 1999: the origin Kinyarwanda K0344089, French K0359435, and English K0366726.  I see a copy has been provided to the witness on the stand.
If he could refer to the original Kinyarwanda, the last page, and look at the bottom where there's a thumbprint. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND: 
Q.	Can you tell us, is that your thumbprint and your statement; yes or no? 
A.	I can see a document that has been fingerprinted, but I normally sign my documents.  I never fingerprint documents.  So how is it possible?  
(Pages 46 to 56 by Eleanor Bastian)































1645H
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Would you agree with me that your name appears just to the left of that fingerprint?
A.	You know people write such things.  You can write them, and you can sign them.  I don't see that that proves anything.  I write in Kinyarwanda.  And there might be some translators who then translate the document and sign in my place or on my behalf.  I don't understand.  Had I known, I would have brought my own documents with me because I have them at home.  I kept all the documents that I produced and copies thereof, and I do not recognise this document.  You know that at the public prosecutor's office, they can, the IPJ, for example, can invent such documents if they so wish. 
Q.	Thank you for that answer.  My question, however, was asking you, yes or no, is that your name to the left of the thumbprint?  If you could answer my question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness has already answered that question. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
I didn't get that in English, Your Honour.  I got that he didn't acknowledge the document.  I can move on to something else, Your Honour.  
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness FE31, would you agree with me, without saying the names, the names of your parents appear in the first paragraph; yes or no? 
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, Your Honours -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Nekuie.  
MR. NEKUIE:
-- I don't know whether the Chamber has the same opinion on the subject of this document.  Despite the fact that this document has been rejected by the witness, I don't know whether you should allow the Prosecutor to continue questioning him on that document.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, this is the same question.  Earlier on, I said that the majority had accepted this line of questioning but, of course, you must not forget the fact that we are professionals and that we will, of course, assess the probative value of all of this.  It is not because we are listening to the questions that that means that the document has a probative value for us.  That happens at a later stage.  But for the time being, we are listening to the questions and to the answers.  
MR. NEKUIE:
I just wanted to know exactly what your position was, Madam President.  That was all.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  
Prosecutor, you may address the Court.  
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	My question is still pending:  Do your parents' names, without saying them, appear on the top of that document, or near the top?
A.	Yes, the names of my parents are indicated there. 
Q.	And they are correct, those are your actual parents' names?
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And on the 19th of November 1999, were you in custody, if you recall?
A.	Did you say the 14th, Prosecutor?  The 14th of which month?  
Q.	Were you in custody on the 19th of November 1999?
A.	I was in custody. 
Q.	Now, if I understand your previous testimony, you said you were released.  Was it in ************** '99; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that's correct.  I was released on the ***************** 1999.  
Q.	And several weeks before that release, do you remember having had some sort of interview or hearing with regard to your temporary detention that would have resulted in the decision freeing you?
A.	Yes, I met members of the public prosecutor's office and also of the counsel of judges -- of the committee of judges. 
Q.	And you see some of those names of the people you met with on that document; correct?  Uhimana (phonetic), Nahimiyimana, N-A-H-I-M-I-Y-I-M-A-N-A, and the registrar, Yatubabariye, Y-A-T-U-B-A-B-A-R-I-Y-E?
A.	I don't know the names of those people that I met with.  I only know one person by the name of Alphonse. 
Q.	And you would agree with me that the name Alphonse Nahimiyimana appears on that document as a legal officer of the prosecutor's office; correct?
A.	Yes, I can see that name.  
Q.	And you would agree with me that that document at the bottom appears to bear a seal of the Rwanda Republic; is that correct?
A.	Yes, I can see it.  
Q.	And on that document there's only one question and one answer, and I'm going to read it to you to see if it refreshes your memory as to that document.  

"Q.  What are your grounds of defence in respect of the acts for which you are accused by the legal officer?"  

"A.  I did not commit these offences.  I stayed in the house.  I did not go anywhere.  I did not go to the church."   
And I'm going to stop there to protect the witness's identity.  

Having heard that read back to you, and with the name Alphonse, and the fact that you're in custody, and you recall a hearing, would you agree with me that that would be a recording or a memorialisation of something you said on or about the 19th of November 1999, yes or no?
A.	Lots of questions have been asked or were asked by the public prosecutor's office when we were placed in detention in 1995.  Sometimes we were compelled and, in that context, I might have written such a thing down.  However, in my case file, I never made a statement of that type.  My case file was compiled within the judge's committee.  And what I stated does not tally with what is written here.  And it is on the basis of my case file that I was released.  And that very document has not -- or, was not transferred to the Gacaca court. 
Q.	I understand that that document may not be in a file of your Gacaca.  What I understood at the beginning of your statement -- or, your response, I should say, is that you may have made that statement.  I put it to you that you did, in fact, make that statement.  Would you agree with me? 
A.	No, I didn't make a statement like that.  Had I made such a statement, I would have said, yes, that that document was produced by the prosecutor's office, but I don't recognise or acknowledge this document. 
Q.	Okay.  Now I understand you to say that you did not make that statement, although before you said you may have.  And when you said you may have, didn't you say that you might have been forced or compelled to say that?  Did I recollect that correctly?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
One second, Witness, please.  

Counsel Nekuie.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, I would like to remind the Prosecutor that the witness said a specific thing:  He said that when he was arrested in 1995, from that year on, a number of questions -- or, a considerable number of questions were asked of him and other people, and under coercion.  He didn't say, however, that in 1999 and, specifically, the date that the Prosecutor has provided, he didn't say that he made such a statement.  He rejected that fact and everyone has heard that.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  

Prosecutor.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
That's not my recollection, but I'll rephrase and pose a different question.  
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Now, when you said you were compelled to give some answers to the considerable number of questions and answers put to you during your detention, would you agree with me that this is something you said under compulsion or force?
A.	During that period, many questions were asked of me and, as a result, I can't remember them all.  Sometimes one can answer a question, and the person asking you a question then can ask an additional question, or he can supplement information to the response that you provided. 
Q.	Do I understand from your last answer that you may have given this answer, but you don't recollect that today? 
A.	I don't remember. 
Q.	Now, your answer, although clear, I'm not sure if it will be clear on the record for people reading it afterwards.  When you say you can't remember -- let me withdraw and rephrase.  You do not recall the statement although it may be yours.  
A.	No, I didn't make the statement that has been written down in this document.  
Q.	So when you said you can't remember, what were you referring to?
A.	I quite simply remember having made a statement when I was in Kibuye after -- or, before I was released, and it is not the statement that appears in the document before me.  
Q.	Thank you for that.  I'm going to ask that you look at another document.  Hold on just a moment.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
With the help of the registry, I'm going to ask that the Counsel, the Bench and the witness look at a document dated 5 November 1999, which appears to be a statement of the witness.  This has been given to the Defence.  With regard to this document of 5 November 1999, the references are Kinyarwanda K0344091; French K0359431; English, K0366735, again, a Rwandan statement, Your Honours.  

Now, I see that document has been given to the witness on the stand.  He's looking at the last page of the package which is the Kinyarwanda original.  
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	And I'd ask him if he sees his name on the bottom left next to which a thumbprint appears?  
A.	I can see the part of the document where my name is written.  And, as I said on a number of occasions, normally, I sign documents, I never fingerprint them.  I append my own signature.  And I wonder where those people who provided these documents with fingerprints got them from.  Assigned to all the statements that I made, I have never affixed my thumbprint on my statements.  I am, therefore, wondering from where this document comes. 
Q.	Would you agree with me on the top left-hand corner of the Kinyarwanda original, it says "Kibuye parquet", that is, Office of the Prosecutor; is that correct?
A.	Yes, indeed. 
Q.	And you were in custody in Kibuye, in fact, on the -- 5 November 1999; correct?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And that document actually has the questions and answers numbered.  And I would ask you to confirm that question four and answer reads as following:  

"Q.  Can you cite a few people who had these victims killed?"  

"A.  They were communal authorities, like IPJ, Kayishema, Sergeant Christophe Mbakirirehe and Adrien Maharamu."

Did you make that statement?
A.	No, I never made such statements.  I never made such a statement.  When I was detained in Kibuye from the 19th of July 1995, I was summonsed to the Office of the Prosecutor only once, and I was questioned as to why I was in custody.  I told them that I did not know.  And I was asked what I would want, and I said I would wish to be released, but I didn't say -- what I said, I didn't know why I was in custody and it was after that incident that I was released and no case file was prepared for me.  So I do not know the prevalence of this document that the Prosecutor has shown me.  
Q.	Well, you've just told us that it was -- on the top of the document it says "Kibuye".  Would you also agree with me that the names of your parents, again, appear in the top of that document, in with the form portion, and that your year of birth and cellule appear, as well as your occupation, your marital status?  If you can answer yes or no, please.
A.	I can see what is written there. 
Q.	And all those pieces of information I've mentioned that appear are true and correct?
A.	I never made the statements that have been written down in this document.  I was expecting to see a case file that would have been prepared as soon as I was arrested and which would have to do with the looting.  I haven't seen such a document detailing such actions.  And I was asked, "You are accused of having kept a -- roofing sheets in your custody."  And I said the roofing sheets were given to me by the marque.  And all the documents that you have shown me, I do not see the document that was written when I was questioned in respect of the roofing sheets.  
Q.	My question to you was different.  My question was:  Are the names of your parents; your date of birth; your cellule; your occupation; marital status correct on the top of that document; yes or no?
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, you are asking me to answer by yes and no.  It is true that I gave my particulars or identity to the Office of the Prosecutor.  And they can reproduce them on every document, but I have told you that I do not recognise this document.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
Your Honour, I don't know if I'm going to be obliged to ask this question a third time.  It's a yes or no question.  I'm happy to proceed again, but I might ask for your assistance.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, I'm sorry, but you asked a question and the witness answered the said question.  Obviously, he was more subtle.  He probably didn't give you the answer you were expecting, that is, the answer by yes or no, but he answered you, so you can move on to another line of questioning.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
I will move on if I understand that to be an instruction, Your Honour.  
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Do I understand that this document, dated 5 November 1999, you also say it is a false document, a forgery?
A.	It is not an authentic document.  
Q.	Is it a forgery, yes or no?
A.	As far as I'm concerned, it is a fabrication. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you, Your Honour.  At this time, I would ask to move those four statements; namely, 18 December 2001, 14 January 2000, 19 November 1999, and 5 November 1999 into evidence as the next four exhibits of the Prosecutor, under seal, for the weight the Chamber seeks to give them.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objection on the part of the Defence?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Obviously, we'd like to raise an objection, Madam President, Your Honours.  These are documents that have been rejected formerly by the witness, documents that the Prosecutor has been able to use instead of all these questions that he put to the witness.  And I don't see how your august Chamber could accept these documents as Prosecution Exhibits.  The witness recognised only one document.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can the Prosecutor or the registry officials be of assistance to us in respect of the reference numbers to be attached to those documents?  
MR. MUSSA:
Your Honours, the next exhibit will be P. 44.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
So to assist the Chamber, Your Honour, the first statement to which I made reference is 18 December 2001.  I would ask that that be admitted as Prosecution Exhibit 44, under seal.  The Kinyarwanda would be first, and the French second, and the English translation to follow.  

Do you want to do this individually, or should I make submissions as to all four?  

I can carry on, Your Honour.  With regard to the -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Prosecutor.  This will make sure that we do not repeat ourselves.  

MR. TOWNSEND:
I thank you, Your Honours.  The following exhibit I would move to admit would be Prosecutor's Exhibit 45, which I've referred to as the statement of 14 January 2000.  We have that document in three languages; Kinyarwanda, French and English.  Now, just for the record, English and French translations of that document do not conform to the original with regard to the name of this witness on line three.  Just so the record reflects that.  

With regard to the following exhibit, which I would move to admit, is Prosecutor's Exhibit 46, that would be the statement of 19 November 1999, again in three languages.  

And, finally, Prosecutor's Exhibit 47, the statement of 5 November 1999, all under seal.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The documents as listed by the Prosecutor, that is, exhibits P. 44 to P. 47, and where possible, we will have them as a P. 44A, B, C to P. 47 will be admitted as a Prosecution witness -- Prosecution Exhibits, and the Bench will assess the weight to be attached to the documents.  These documents will be placed under seal.  
(Exhibit No. P. 44A, P. 44B and P. 44C admitted, under seal) 
(Exhibit No. P. 45A, P. 45B and P. 45C admitted, under seal) 
(Exhibit No. P. 46A, P. 46B and P. 46C admitted, under seal) 
(Exhibit No. P. 47A, P. 47B and P. 47C admitted, under seal) 
MR. TOWNSEND:
I thank you, Your Honours.  

At this time, I have less than a dozen questions remaining and I would ask that we move into closed session as I presume the answers may reveal the identity of this witness, and then I'll be concluded.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Does the Defence have any objection as to us moving into closed session?  

Very well.  The Bench hereby orders we are now moving into closed session.  So we will be sitting in closed session in order to ensure the protection of the witness and in the interest of justice.  We do apologise to the persons in the public gallery. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 64 to 67] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 57 to 63 by Roxane Meena)




MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecutor, you may proceed.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you, Your Honour.  Just briefly, I just want to see if I understand what Counsel Monthé is submitting.  The next witness is CF23, that's not what we heard in English.  He doesn't intend to call that witness next but, rather, jump down to witness 10 on this new list to FE34.  And if that's the case, normally that would be done by motion.  And, secondly -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, registry official.  Now, I think we are doing housekeeping issues, and this can be done in open court.  We are still in closed session, so can we revert to open session.  

I'm sorry that I had to interrupt you once again, Prosecutor, but the floor is yours.  But I think you want clarifications as concerns the order of appearance of the witnesses.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you, Your Honours.  In fact, you're asking for exactly what I asked for, so no apology is necessary.  

I understand the next witness the Defence seeks to call is FE34, and the Bench asked him to indicate the next two witnesses, so I am just curious if he can indicate, if he knows, who would follow FE34.  

And the other matter of housekeeping, Your Honour, is that tomorrow from 4:00 to 6 p.m. there is a memorial service, so I'm not sure if this Chamber seeks to take that into consideration as to the duration of our sitting hours tomorrow.  Thank you.  

Mr. Moses is out of the country; and Ms. Althea is ill, it is my understanding, from our office; and Ms. Arbia is on leave.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I would like to turn to Counsel Monthé.  I didn't quite understand.  You said tomorrow we'll be having this Witness FE31, is that it, who will be coming back for the re-examination?  Now, what I wanted to know is if you can give us the names of the two other witnesses that we should be hearing tomorrow, but this doesn't mean that we're going to hear them of necessity.  All of this would depend.  I think I had asked that at least two witnesses should be brought everyday, thus in the event that we have witnesses who fall ill.  And with all the difficulties that all of that entails, and if a witness is not available, we can move on to the next witness.  I also seem to have understood that you moved from the fifth witness on the list to the tenth witness.  Can you enlighten us on that?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I wish -- well, I will not overlook what the Prosecutor has just said because I don't stand in a confusion.  All these considerations, all these -- the idea of being compassionate with their colleague that has died, well, we share their sorrow.  The Defence definitely shares the sorrow of the Prosecution that there is a ceremony tomorrow at 4 p.m.  We understand that.  But as concerns the list, I think he said we needed to file a motion in order to vary the list.  We're rather taken back because I've been in this trial since the very beginning.  The Prosecution has varied its list on several occasions.  And, at a certain point, Madam President, there were two Italians, Mr. Farijia and Mr. Massimo Materasi, who were brought here and who we were told here that one was tired, we had to adjourn proceedings to the afternoon.  Now, we didn't oppose that fact.  

Now, the problem we have here is easy, we have an organising problem.  We're not doing this to disturb anyone whosoever.  There are many of us and we need to put things in order.  I have told the Chamber that Witness CF23 had to be brought here, but he's not ready.  We couldn't work with him because he was not accessible.  When we went to the safe house he was here.  We've told the Chamber -- Trial Chamber that we will go on to Witness FE34, and I don't know what terrible problem that is.  

Now, we are trying to stick to the list and, Madam President, it wouldn't serve a purpose to bring two witnesses here who cannot appear.  Those witnesses were not with us in Cameroon, they were in Rwanda and they came here on a certain date and we're doing all we can so that we can call them to appear.  And I can't say more than that.  So, Madam President, in addition to that list, I will say that I will give a list that will more reflect the scheduling order that we will have after having gone to the safe house and verified matters.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Monthé, I did not hear the Prosecutor say that you need to file a motion.  In any case, I did not hear that.  What I understood is that we need to know well beforehand the witnesses that you wish to call.  In any case, that's the question that I asked you.  And I've told you which are the two witnesses that we can call tomorrow for -- as I said a while ago, there are witnesses that are often sick.  And if, at every turn, we have to adjourn, we may run into problems because right now we have a list of 15 witnesses that need to appear for us to hear them, and we had said that we may finish by Easter, and now we are skeptical because we will try to assess what still has to be done in order to see whether at -- around the 27th of April we would have concluded proceedings or probably even later.  Now, I'll put the question to you again:  You told us FE34, which is the other witness that you will be calling?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I have told you that FE34 will be coming tomorrow.  You want us to give you two names?  For now, I don't know which is the second witness that will be coming tomorrow, but we'll go to the safe house and see what we can do.  I, generally, don't say that I will do something that I won't be able to do.  I know that, Madam President, as I have told you, we're here to do our job.  I will do this job, even though under difficult circumstances.  Please, try to bear with us.  Understand us.  We can give six names and call them here, but we won't be able to do anything.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, I'm rather sorry, Mr. Monthé, we're here to hear your witnesses, and all measures have to be taken to ensure that there are no breaks in the appearance of your witnesses.  So you have to take all necessary measures to ensure that -- this is what obtains.  You say that you cannot tell us right away which witness will be appearing after FE34.  Well, you say you'll be going to the safe house and tomorrow morning you will definitely be in a position to tell us who will be the witness that will be appearing after FE34.  And, again -- so, if you want to give the names of those witnesses to the WVSS so that they can be brought tomorrow, that would be advisable.  

In the absence of any other questions, we're going to adjourn.  I wish to thank everyone.  We've gone beyond closing time, a little bit, and we're sorry for that.  

So the proceedings stand adjourned. 
(Court adjourned at 1745H)
