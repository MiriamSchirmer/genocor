MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is called to order.  Ladies and gentleman, good morning. 

Witness, good morning. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yesterday the Prosecutor concluded the -- or his cross-examination.  Mr. Nekuie, this morning will now embark on the re-examination.  We ask you to listen attentively to the questions that would be put to you so that you answer them in a precise manner.  You are still under oath. 

Mr. Nekuie, you can now proceed. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Madam President. 
WITNESS FE31,
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Good morning, Witness FE31? 
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	I now have a few questions for you just to round up our examination.  On which day did you make your confession before the Gacaca courts, if you remember? 
A.	I made my confession on the 31st of December 2004. 
Q.	Thank you.  Have you since then denied your involvement in the events that occurred in Nyange? 
A.	I never denied the accusations levelled against me. 
Q.	Thank you.  Yesterday, the Prosecutor showed you a set of documents which, allegedly, bore your fingerprints and you rejected them.  Do you still stand by that, namely, that you do not recognise those documents? 
A.	I do not recognise the documents that were tendered before me by the Prosecutor, because when I was interviewed by the prosecutor's office in Kibuye, I knew what I said.  I knew which document I did recognise and signed.  You see, Télésphore was present during the Gacaca sessions and my case file was no longer there, it had been transferred to my colline, and when they heard what I stated and when they learned that I had come here to testify, that is here in Arusha, they sent all those documents to the Prosecutor here. 
Q.	Thank you, FE31.  Now specifically on the document that you recognised and signed, namely, that of the 18th of December 2001, did they deal with the events of the 16th of April 1994 or all the events that occurred in Nyange in 1994?  
MR. TOWNSEND:
I would just object to as one, leading, and two, the document is not before him. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you rephrase your question, Counsel? 
MR. NEKUIE: 
I shall oblige, Madam President. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness FE31, the document shown to you by the Prosecutor yesterday and which was admitted as an exhibit at the bottom of which you had appended your signature and which you said you drafted yourself, now, on which event was that document on? 
A.	I am the one who drafted that document.  I recognised the document and I do also recognise the date on which I produced it.  It was done while I was in Nyange.  I did say that I kept some cattle on the 16th, and it is in that document that I said that I never went back to Nyange.  I, however, denied the events that were alleged to have occurred on the 16th. 
Q.	Thank you.  Thank you once more for those clarifications. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, Your Honours, the Defence now concludes that re-examination. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Nekuie. 

Did you want to say something, Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
Before concluding my testimony, I would like to request to add something to my testimony. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may speak. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.  I am grateful to you for having accommodated me here even though we still have quite a path to traverse before determining the truth.  

A lot of people do not want that peace be restored after all the problems that Rwanda has faced and which are a source of sadness for us all.  We are most worried today that people will no longer tell the truth; they are only telling lies.  I am, therefore, pleased with your decision to go on site, that is, to go to Nyange to check on the events that occurred there.  My hope is that this will continue so that the members of the population who are there on the spot -- so that they be able to provide you with information.  It would be good for both parties, the Defence and the Prosecution, to be present because the situation is worsening.  Let me conclude by saying, thank you. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  Your testimony before this Court is now at an end.  We thank you for coming and for having answered questions put to you.  We wish you a safe journey back to your home.  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
Madam President, thank you. 
(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Monthé, you said yesterday that the next witness would be FE34; is that the case?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel Monthé nods. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can FE34 be brought in?  Are you able to now tell us who will be the next witness, Counsel Monthé? 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, Your Honours, good morning.  The next witness will be CF23 after this one.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel. 

Good morning, Witness FE34.  Can you hear me? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can hear you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are a Defence witness.  You are a protected witness.  You will be led in examination by the Defence, and then the Prosecutor will lead cross-examination.  If need be, the Judges will ask you questions and the Defence will also re-examine you.  You will need to listen very carefully to the questions put to you and provide a concise and precise answer.  We will ask you to make the solemn declaration before answering the questions. 
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Witness, will you stand up, please.  
(Declaration made by Witness FE34 in Kinyarwanda) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Monthé, you will be leading the witness in evidence?  

MR. MONTHÉ:
Very modestly, yes, Madam President, it will be me.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Counsel, you may address the Court. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President. 
WITNESS FE34,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows: 
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Good morning, Witness. 
A.	Good morning. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, with your leave and before leading the witness in evidence, Witness FE34, I would please ask the clerk to come up to the Defence in order to get hold of the document that I have before me, please. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, you have just been handed a document, could you look at this document closely please, and tell me whether the particulars on this document tally with your identity?  Thank you. 
A.	I have a problem.  This document is written in French and I don't speak French. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, could you please ask the Kinyarwanda booth to come and read to the witness the particulars on the document because, of course, the Defence Counsel does not speak Kinyarwanda?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Would the Kinyarwanda booth please assist us?  Could an interpreter please go and help the witness?  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the witness has said that all the particulars on the document -- on the identification document are correct. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Interpreter. 

Counsel Monthé, you may address the Court. 

MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  I would like in turn to thank the interpreter and also ask the Chamber and Madam President to enter this document as a Defence exhibit, as number 73 to be placed under seal.  Thank you.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
One second, please.  No objection on the part of the Prosecutor. 

So this document bearing the number TF -- no, FE34 is entered as an exhibit, a Defence exhibit under 
number D. 73 and placed under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. 73 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Counsel Monthé. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, I am going to start leading a discussion with you this morning, Witness.  I am going to ask you a number of questions about the events that occurred in Nyange in April 1994.  I would ask you to listen very attentively to what I have to say and if your question or my question does not seem clear to you, please say so and I will rephrase it.  I would also ask you to reply as precisely and concisely as possible.  Have you understood what I have just said?  
A.	Yes, Counsel, I have understood.
Q.	Thank you.	 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I think we can begin leading the witness in evidence in open session, because I don't think there are any issues arising out of the identification of the witness.  Thank you. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, I would like to ask you where you were in April 1994.  Could you please reply to this question without giving any specific information on your area for us to understand and respect your identity?  Thank you. 
A.	I lived in my cellule, in my home. 
Q.	Thank you.  Do you know Kibuye commune? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	In Kivumu, did you know Nyange? 
A.	Yes, I know Nyange. 
Q.	Witness FE34, can you tell the Chamber whether in April 1994 there was a church in Nyange? 
A.	Yes, there was and that church was demolished on the 16th of April 1994. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Were you in a habit of going to this church? 
A.	Yes, I went there. 
Q.	Did you often go to that church? 
A.	I went there occasionally. 
Q.	Can you remember or have you got an image of the church in your mind before it was demolished? 
A.	What I do remember with respect to that church is that there was a plaque with the date "1953" on the side of the church. 
Q.	Thank you. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, at this juncture, I would like to ask you to distribute or circulate a photograph, so that I can ask the witness a specific question.  Thank you.

Madam President, this document is already in the case file KO35, and it is a Prosecution exhibit.  I can't remember the exact number, I am afraid.  If the registry could help us to find that reference number. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court clerk, could you please go and take the photograph that Counsel Monthé has produced and could you also see exactly which exhibit it is, which number it has been filed or entered under? 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, the exhibit -- I just wanted to say, Madam President, that there is a colour photograph that I wanted to distribute.  However, you have the photocopy in black and white because we couldn't -- we didn't manage to produce a colour version. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecutor, could you please give us a name of that exhibit or the number of that exhibit?  
MR. TOWNSEND:
I was just going to ask the registry to keep looking.  I would just prefer that the actual exhibit be shown rather than a photocopy that actually bears words on it, and the words might not necessarily allow the witness to give his own evidence. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think that we have found the exhibit.  It is the photo P. 321.  P. 321. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
I say the actual exhibit P. 231 is what can be shown to the witness.  I have no objection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The witness has the document in front of him. 

Counsel Monthé, you may proceed. 

MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, could you please look very carefully at the photograph that you have before you?

Have you had a good look at it, Witness? 
A.	Yes, I have had a good look at the photograph. 
Q.	In your opinion, Witness, is this the Nyange church?  Does that photograph represent Nyange church as you remember it? 
A.	I find that this is not a photograph of Nyange church. 
Q.	Why do you say that this is not photograph of Nyange church? 
A.	Because I can't see the writing on the walls that I have already mentioned to you. 
Q.	Apart from this writing or inscription, are there other details that you can't discern on this photograph? 
A.	I am also a little bit dubious because to the side of church, I can see a small wood or forest, but the way I remember Nyange church, there were houses next to the church and I don't think that a photographer could have been able to see the small copse. 
Q.	Witness, thank you.  Could you tell the Chamber whether this is, in fact, a photograph of another church that exists in Rwanda today, to your mind? 
A.	In view of the fact that most of the Rwandan churches are built on the same plan, then it's difficult for me to identify the church and to tell you whether it is a church located in this place or another, but I confirm, I am sure that this is not Nyange church. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, you told the Chamber that you were familiar with it -- that you knew Nyange church and that you had been there on a number of occasions.  At what time, Witness, or when did you find or hear of the death of the President of Rwanda? 
A.	I heard of his death on the 7th of April 1994. 
Q.	When you heard the news, did you then go to Nyange church, to the parish? 
A.	No, I didn't immediately go to Nyange.  I went on the 16th of April 1994. 
Q.	Thank you. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, before pursuing, I would like to tell the Chamber that in the witness's statement from 2005, that was handed over to you, there was a translation error.  When we interviewed the witness, it was said that the witness had an interview with the Prosecution team, which is not actually true.  I wanted to mention that fact so that there is no confusion or debate and so that we know that FE34 was not interviewed by the Prosecution team of the ICTR.  So that part of the document or that statement within the document is actually an error and a mistranslation. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  
Yes, Prosecution. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
I would just prefer that such notices be done before the witness takes the stand, and not in front of the witness.  That is all, Your Honour. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, I don't know if the Prosecutor has just raised an objection, but I would have appreciated it if he stopped giving me lessons, otherwise, I might have to answer in a rather disagreeable manner.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, both of you, I would like us to proceed and continue the debate in a serene manner as possible.

Thank you, Counsel Monthé.  Please proceed with your next question.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President, but I would not like courtesy to be something that we all forget. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, you knew Nyange church, you said.  When did you meet Father Seromba the first time? 
A.	I saw him for the first time in November or around November 1993. 
Q.	Where did you see Father Seromba when you saw him? 
A.	I saw him in Nyange. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You told us that you were living in your secteur or you were actually in your secteur when you heard of the president's death; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Thank you.  What did you do after the date when you heard of the president's death, and up to the 16th when you went to Nyange? 
A.	After hearing of the president's death, from the 7th until the 13th of April there was a disturbance.  There was total disorder within the cellule and war broke out and people began to die.  Between 
	the 13th and the 16th there was problem within our cellule, and this means that the events that occurred -- occurred in my cellule -- and I took part in them, which means that I also took part in the Nyange events on the 16th of April 1994. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Right.  We are going to come down to facts in a chronological manner.  You said that from the 7th there was a disturbance in your area and that the members of the population had started to die; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.  People started dying on the 13th of April.
Q.	Thank you for that clarification.  The people who started dying, who were they and how did they die?  Could you give us more particulars or more clarification on that point?  Thank you.  
A.	In actual fact, when I pleaded guilty to the crimes that I committed, it was the Tutsis that were actually targeted and they were killed by Hutus. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Could you tell the Chamber why the Tutsis were targeted and killed after the president's plane was shot down, the day after it was shot down, if you know? 
A.	The disturbances began immediately after the president's death, that is, on the 7th of April. 
Q.	But why did those disturbances begin?  Was there a relation between the shooting down of the president's plane and the killings perpetrated against the Tutsis? 
A.	In actual fact, after the death of the president it was said that he had been killed by the Tutsis, and that is where the disturbances began.  The members of the population then began the killings. 
Q.	Amongst the members of the population who began killing Tutsis in your cellules, were you one of those people? 
A.	I was not at the residence of the first person to be killed in my cellule.  But as far as the victims are concerned, those who were killed afterwards, I did take part. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, could you tell the Chamber what motivated you to take part in the killing of the Tutsi population? 
A.	I took part in the killings of Tutsis because it was an activity in which everybody was to take part in.  People said that everyone had to take part in the fighting, that is, anybody who was not sick; everyone had to take part in that combat. 
Q.	When you say to the Chamber that all healthy individuals needed to be involved in the combat, who exactly was the person saying that? 
A.	It was the responsable de secteur and of the cellule, because they were our leaders, after all. 
Q.	For this information to come to your ears, to your knowledge, inviting you to become involved in these activities, were there meetings, and if so, did you take part in those meetings or did you attend them? 
A.	I didn't attend any meeting and I don't know whether any meeting was held with that purpose in mind.  People gave each other the information verbally and it went from one person to the next.
Q.	Do you remember whether the figures of authority you are talking about provided vehicles for those people who were to be involved in the activity, as you say? 
A.	In actual fact, there was a vehicle that people used to drive around in, that was alerting people to the effect that the enemy had attacked Nyange.  I then learned that this vehicle belonged to a Tutsi by the name of Rwamasirabo, and that this vehicle had been taken by force.  The people in this vehicle were inciting the members of the population to go and "rescue" Nyange.
MR. MONTHÉ:
I think I am going to spell Rwamasirabo to you, R-W-A-M-A-S-I-R-A-B-O.  Thank you.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Do you remember, Witness, what make that vehicle was and also who was driving around in that vehicle, if you recall? 
A.	Yes, I remember the vehicle because I knew the vehicle beforehand.  It was a white Toyota and the person that I identified driving around in this vehicle was Anasthase Rushema.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Rushema is R-U-S-H-E-M-A, Anasthase.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, who was Anasthase Rushema, if you know? 
A.	Before the war he was the deputy bourgmestre, but at that time of the war, he was a teacher. 
Q.	Thank you.  Tell me, Witness FE34, wasn't it possible for you to remain at home instead of going to take part in the massacres? 
A.	Any able bodied person had to go and take part in the fighting because the authorities at the time were asking us to do so. 
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Witness FE34, can you tell the Trial Chamber what happened to the able-bodied persons who did not participate in the fighting as you say? 
A.	Anybody who refused to go and take part in the activity was a subject of suspicions.  People started wondering why so-and-so or such a person was refusing to go along with the others; such a person would be suspected of hiding something back in his home. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE34.  But was -- were the people only the subject of suspicion -- if you were suspected of hiding something at home, are you liable to some kind of penalty? 
A.	I can give you, for instance, as example, a good number of members of the population whose livestock were confiscated or whose houses were destroyed, merely because they had refused to take part in the activity. 
Q.	Under what circumstances and by whom were such people -- did such people find their livestock confiscated or their homes destroyed? 
A.	If I have to answer your question, I would be compelled to mention a few names.  Can you reassure me that there is no danger as to my being -- there is no risk that I may be identified?
Q.	Well, if you have names that you want to mention to the Trial Chamber, we are going to ask the President to give leave that you be given a sheet of paper on which you can write the said names in order to comply with the custom that has been in practice in this Trial Chamber for some days now.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Registry official, do you have a sheet of paper that you can give to the witness?  
THE WITNESS:
I am not adept at writing.  I don't know if I can be assisted here. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Probably, Madam President, we should keep this until the end where we will apply for a small closed session in which the names can be given. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Counsel, if you want to keep some questions that you will put to the witness during the closed session -- during a closed session so that we protect the within, because it will be a little tricky if the witness can't write properly.  It would be better -- it would be easier to proceed in that manner.
You may proceed.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Very well, Madam President. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, when, precisely, did you leave your cellule to go to Nyange? 
A.	I left my cellule on the 15th of April 1994.  I got to Nyange at about 9 p.m. -- at about 9 p.m. 
Q.	Thank you.  When you got to Nyange on that 15th April, what did you do?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Actually the witness said he got to Nyange at 9 o'clock.  The witness corrects himself.  He says it was the 16th, instead.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Thank you, Witness, for that clarification.  

Now, my questions still stands.  On the 16th of April 1994, at what time did you get to Nyange and what did you do?  That was my question.  
A.	I just said that I reached Nyange.  I did not have a watch, but I think I got there at about 9 o'clock.  And when I got there, I found a large crowd of people, including the bourgmestre, the communal conseillers, reservists and gendarmes.  All these people were shooting, you know, at people in the church. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Should the Trial Chamber take it that when you got to Nyange, you immediately merged yourself in the group of assailants? 
A.	Yes, since that was a reason for which I went to Nyange, I immediately joined the other assailants. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Mr. Witness, if I were to ask you the question before this Trial Chamber.  If you can be described as an Interahamwe; would that be correct? 
A.	If the assailants who were at that location can be characterised as Interahamwe, then I am one of them.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  So you said that you reached Nyange parish at about 9 o'clock on the 16th of April, was that at 9 o'clock in the morning? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Very well.  And that number of persons who were shooting or firing at the church, did you recognise some of the people who were firing at the church? 
A.	Yes, I know some of those who were firing at the church.
Q.	Thank you.  I am not going to ask you to give me names now.  We will go into that later. 

At the time you were in Nyange on the 16th of April, can you describe to the Trial Chamber the prevailing atmosphere there?  Were there dead persons already there, did you see any, and what exactly was happening? 
A.	On the 16th of April at that Nyange church the tension was very high.  When you got to the church, you felt like escaping and returning home. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  But, then, why did you remain at the Nyange church on that day? 
A.	I remained there because there was a large crowd of people, members of the population, and I felt that I needed to be part of them.  Actually, I followed the -- I was led by the mob mentality.  I wasn't scared and I felt that if anything bad were to happen to us, I wouldn't be the only person since I was part of the group, in any case.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  On that day, the 16th of April, did you personally kill Tutsis? 
A.	I am an ordinary farmer; I had no authority or didn't have power or strength to do anything whatsoever, even those who had guns felt -- and that is, they were forced to bring a bulldozer. 
Q.	Witness FE34, when you arrived at the Nyange parish on that morning of 16th April, did you see 
	Father Seromba there? 
A.	No, I did not see him. 
Q.	Thank you.  And when you got there, did you see a Caterpillar there? 
A.	I saw a Caterpillar there when -- after I had arrived.  As a matter of fact, there were two of them.
Q.	Can you clarify that point for the Trial Chamber, so you were already at the spot on the scene when the two Caterpillars came to the Nyange church; is that correct? 
A.	I had already arrived there.
Q.	Witness FE34, do you know or were you able to be informed as to who had caused those Caterpillars to be brought to the Nyange church on that 16th day of April? 
A.	I will confirm here that it was the bourgmestre who had made the Caterpillars to be brought there, because he was the highest authority or figure of authority that was there. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, you say it was the bourgmestre, did you know the bourgmestre?  First of all, my first question is, when you say the "bourgmestre", are you referring to the bourgmestre of Kivumu commune? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Follow-up question.  And what was the name of that bourgmestre in question?  
A.	His name was Gregoire Ndahimana. 
Q.	On that morning of the 16th April 1994, was Gregoire Ndahimana, the bourgmestre of your commune on the scene, that is, at the Nyange parish? 
A.	Yes, he was there.  He was present there. 
Q.	Apart from that bourgmestre, were you able to recognise other figures of authority of the commune on the scene that morning? 
A.	Yes, I was able to recognise them. 
Q.	Those figures of authority that you recognised, do you know their names? 
A.	Yes, I know their names, but the other figures of authority who were present and whose names I do not know, but I know some names. 
Q.	Since they are communal authorities, can you please tell the Trial Chamber the names of the figures of authority that you saw there? 
A.	Yes, I am going to give you names since they are communal authorities.  I will start with 
	Gregoire Ndahimana, the bourgmestre, his deputy, Vedaste, Murangwabugabo; another deputy or assistant Silvére Kanani.  There was also the IPJ, Fulgence Kayishema; the brigadier, Christopher Mbakirirehe; the communal police, Bernard Abayisenga; Adrien Niyitegeka.  I think these were -- these are persons that I was able to recognise, but there were also other commune officials.  I would say, in fact, that all the communal officials were present. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE34.
MR. MONTHÉ:

BY MR. MONTHÉ: 
Q.	Mr. Witness, so you had all those officials on the 16th of April 1994 and you saw the two Caterpillars arrive, what happened thereafter or then? 
A.	Upon the arrival of the bulldozers one of them started demolishing the church while the other was digging pits wherein people who were inside the church were going to be buried. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When the bulldozers started pulling down the church, did Father Seromba present himself or go to meet the driver of the bulldozer? 
A.	I did not see him at all.
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, to whom belongs the bulldozers that were destroying the church?  
A.	The two bulldozers belonged to Astaldi company which was constructing the Gitarama-Kibuye road.  
Q.	Witness FE34, do you recall or were you able to know who had given the orders and told the drivers of the bulldozers to destroy the church on that 16th April 1994? 
A.	I confirm that it was the bourgmestre, Ndahimana, who had made those bulldozers to be brought and he is the first person who gave the orders to the effect that the church should be destroyed. 
Q.	Thank you.  When the bulldozers started destroying the church, do you recall whether the refugees were still inside the church? 
A.	Yes, the refugees were still inside the church.
Q.	Thank you.  Were you able to see some of them fleeing? 
A.	No, I did not see anyone trying to escape or to come out of the church, and by the way, it was impossible because the church was heavily surrounded. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did you, personally, witness the total destruction of the church? 
A.	When they starred destroying the church, I was present.  One side of the church was demolished, but the tower remained standing.  It was later pulled down after I had left, but I was some 200 metres from there.  So it was from 200 metres that I saw the tower -- the bell tower of the church collapse. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Were you able to notice on that occasions if there were refugees inside the bell tower of the church at the time the bell tower was being demolished? 
A.	There were people on the bell tower. 
Q.	Were you able to see when the bell tower finally collapsed, if some of the refuges were able to escape or survive the destruction?  
A.	I have told you that the bell tower collapsed after I had left.  I was about 200 metres from the church then.  What this means is that, I cannot describe what happened after that the bell tower collapsed because I wasn't standing close to it. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  But did you later learn from where you were or in the days following the destruction, if there had been survivors from the bell tower of the church?  Did you learn that? 
A.	I never heard that. 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness FE34, it has been said recurrently by a number of persons that it was Father Seromba who had issued the order to the effect that this church be destroyed.  Did you ever hear that while you were at the location or in the days following the destruction of the church in question? 
A.	No, I never heard that. 
Q.	Witness, did you know the person who drove the bulldozer that destroyed the church? 
A.	I did not know that person by name, because I wasn't a native of Kivumu commune.  Later, however, while I was in custody, I learned that that person's name was Anasthase Kinamubanzi.
Q.	Thank you.  Witness FE34, since you were on the scene where the church was being destroyed, do you remember having seen Anasthase Kinamubanzi driving the bulldozer that was destroying the church? 
A.	I do have a recollection of that.
Q.	Do you recall having seen him? 
A.	Are you referring to Kinamubanzi?
Q.	Yes. 
A.	Yes, I did see him there, indeed, he was driving the bulldozer. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE34.  Did you also see the person who, according to you, was driving the second Caterpillar, to use your own words? 
A.	Yes, I saw that person, but I was enable to get his name because most of those people were from another part of town. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  What, therefore, was the role of the second Caterpillar that you saw at the 
	Nyange parish on that 16th day of April? 
A.	The second bulldozer dug pits in which the people that had been killed in the church were buried. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell the Court who gave the instruction for those who were killed at the church to be buried?  Is it Father Seromba who gave the orders or someone else? 
A.	The communal officials who were present also gave the instruction. 
Q.	Witness FE34, when you say "the communal authorities" were those who gave the orders, are you referring to those you have mentioned before? 
A.	Yes, I mean those authorities because they were the ones in the commune. 
Q.	Thank you.  When the church was destroyed, were there still many people at that location in Nyange? 
A.	Are you referring to those who had taken part in the attack?
Q.	Absolutely, Witness. 
A.	Yes, there were still many of them there.
Q.	Thank you.  You say that you left the location, that is, the vicinity of the parish before the bell tower collapsed and that you were some 200 metres from there, why did you suddenly leave the location or the scene? 
A.	When only the bell tower of the church was left standing, the bourgmestre, Ndahimana informed us that there were problems in our secteurs.  So he gave the names of the secteurs and told the members of the population who were native of those secteurs to go and do something.  A truck from Astaldi was brought and people got on board them, (sic) in the company of communal authorities.  And when I was preparing to get on board the truck, there was no more space and I had to track, which is why I left the church before the bell tower actually collapsed. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, can we infer from what you have said that you were a good soldier that was ready to follow the instructions of the authorities? 
A.	You see, you cannot afford not to knuckle under to the instruction of the members -- of authorities, if an authority.  If a figure of authority gives an order, you have to comply or carry out the orders. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  As concerns the destruction of that church, I would like to understand, you told the Trial Chamber that the bourgmestre was the one who gave the order that the church be destroyed.  Did you hear that order yourself, and if you did so, what precisely did he tell the driver of the Caterpillar, Mr. Kinamubanzi?  
A.	Yes, let me confirm that it was the bourgmestre who issued the instructions that the church be demolished.  He did so because when Kinamubanzi started destroying or demolishing the church, those who were around started throwing stones and the bourgmestre went to meet him and they had a discussion.  I couldn't follow that discussion, but after that the bourgmestre stood aside and Kinamubanzi again started demolishing the church using the bulldozer. 
Q.	You were there on the spot.  Could you tell the Court what, in your opinion, was -- or how high the bell tower was, by your own assessment? 
A.	I won't be able to tell you how high it was.  It was quite high. 
Q.	Witness, if I were to suggest to you between five and 10 metres or between 10 and 20 metres or even beyond, would that be the truth, in your opinion? 
A.	In actual fact, I can't give you a measurement of height of the church bell tower.  I could refer to a horizontal distance, but when it is vertical distance, I cannot provide you with that information. 
Q.	Thank you for being sincere.  But if it were to be measured horizontally, what distance would you provide? 
A.	In view of the fact that I was looking at the bell tower and I had to raise my eyes, I won't be able to tell you how many metres; that would be even if it was laid down horizontally.  I am sorry, Counsel. 
Q.	No problem.  No problem with that.  Now, let me ask you, the bell tower that you saw, is it possible, in your view, for a refugee to drop from that bell tower and still be alive, in your opinion? 
A.	That would be impossible. 
Q.	Why would you say that that would be impossible, FE34? 
A.	Given the way the bell tower was set and how high it was, an individual could not drop from that bell tower and survive.  In addition, there were a lot of people who had come to attack those refugees who were there.  So someone who was inside that bell tower could not drop down and escape -- escape from the attack by those who were waiting for the refugees on the spot. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE34.  I would like to know, Witness, for the clarity of our proceedings whether you saw or were able to know whether there were some reverend persons or members of the clergy at that church when it was being demolished in April 1994. 
A.	I knew that Father Nturiye had come.  In fact, I heard that Father Nturiye was present.  
Q.	Apart from that information, you did not know Father Nturiye, personally, did you? 
A.	You are talking about Father Nturiye?
Q.	Absolutely.  Let me repeat my question, and it is as follows:  You, personally, did not know 
	Father Nturiye and you did not know whether he was there at the time that the church was being demolished; would that be correct? 
A.	I knew Father Nturiye, but I only knew, subsequently, that he was present or was at the scene. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you also hear that Father Nturiye -- known to you -- was accused of having participated in the demolishing -- in the demolition of Nyange church; did you get to know that? 
A.	No, no, I didn't hear anything in that regard. 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, I would like to ask you whether on the 16th of April apart from the refugees who were within, that is, inside the church which was about to be demolished, were there any other refugees you might have seen in other parts, buildings of the parish, for instance, in the presbytery? 
A.	No, I did not see anyone.
Q.	FE34, now with regard to those refugees, were you able to ascertain why they gathered at the 
	Nyange church in that -- right up to the 16th of April 1994? 
A.	I didn't manage to know how those refugees got there. 
Q.	FE34, those who asked you to go to Nyange church, for what you described as a war, they didn't tell you who the refugees were? 
A.	I did say that those who were asking members of the population to go to Nyange were saying that Nyange had or was under attack.  
Q.	Now, in that regard, Witness FE34, they were being told that Nyange was being attacked.  Now, according to you, who attacked Nyange?  
A.	We were being told that the Inkotanyi had attacked Nyange.
Q.	FE34, for matters to be clear, could you tell the Court what Inkotanyi means or what it should be understood to mean? 
A.	We were told that Inkotanyi were Inyenzi. 
Q.	Now then, let me ask you the question:  What is Inyenzi, in your opinion? 
A.	We were told that on the whole, all Tutsis were Inyenzi. 
Q.	Thank you for that clarification, FE34.  So those who called on you at Nyange to go and -- they wanted you to go and fight so as to eliminate or exterminate, rather, the Inyenzi. 
A.	Indeed, that is the case, because when we got to the spot, we discovered -- or, it dawned on us that we had to exterminate the Tutsi, that is the activity that we had to engage in. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE34.  We were told and we would like you to clarify or to deny that vehicles were moving all over the collines appealing to you to come and participate in this campaign against the Inyenzi.  Did you see those vehicles or did you hear about them? 
A.	I did not see Father Seromba. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE34.  Did you hear any mention made of the fact that any other member of the clergy, apart from Father Seromba, participated in those events? 
A.	No, I did not hear of that. 
Q.	FE34, you went to the Nyange parish on the 16th of April 1994.  There were a lot of people, as you told us.  Were you able, through those who were there -- were you able to know whether Father Seromba had met with the communal officials whom you referred to earlier? 
A.	No, I didn't hear any mention of that, honestly. 
Q.	FE34, so in your view or in your opinion -- how come in such a sustained manner -- and you who were there and didn't see Father Seromba, how do you explain the fact that Father Seromba is being accused of having demolished church?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, hold on a minute, Witness. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
I think the witness is here to give his evidence as to his observations and perceptions but not his opinions.  This question calls for opinion, is impermissible. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Monthé, could you rephrase your question, please? 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	A number of people have accused Father Seromba of having demolished the Nyange church.  Do you confirm that allegation?
A.	No, that is not true.
Q.	Thank you.  Witness FE34, while you were there, were you able to hear that Father Seromba had some special hatred for the Tutsis? 
A.	I am not aware of any hatred on his part against the Tutsis. 
Q.	Now, FE34, the refugees who went to the Nyange parish in April 1994 -- well, did you learn or did you hear that they were mistreated by Father Seromba? 
A.	I can say nothing on that matter, because before the 16th I didn't go to Nyange. 
Q.	FE34, I now want to ask you, what is your situation as of today?  You are in Rwanda.  You are currently in custody; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I am a detainee. 
Q.	Thank you.  I won't be asking you about where you are detained.  Could you tell the Court for how long you have been in detention or you have been remanded in custody?  
A.	I was arrested on the 31st of March 1996.
Q.	Thank you. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, there are a number of questions that would require that we congregate in closed session, and I would request for leave of the Chamber to move into a closed session so that I can put questions which might reveal the identity of the witness.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Monthé, thank you.  Do you still have quite a number of questions to ask before we move into closed session?  
MR. MONTHÉ:  
I would like to conclude with questions in closed session, and after that I think we will conclude very quickly. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now, I am asking this question because I am wondering whether we should take a break now.  If you still have -- for say, 10, 15 minutes, we can hear you.
MR. MONTHÉ:
I think it would be preferable that we take a break and then we continue after that.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you.  We will take a break for a couple of minutes and then we will resume in closed session.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are now in open session.  Prosecutor, you may proceed. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you very much, Your Honours. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness, when you began your testimony, today, you spoke about the fact that Nyange church had a plaque that denoted its construction in 1953; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct, yes. 
Q.	And that plaque was on the front or facade of the church; is that correct? 
A.	That plaque was in the rear on one side, facing the statue.  I don't know whether you remember the statue, but if you were to produce the picture, I could point out to you where that plaque was set. 
Q.	When you say "statue" you are referring to what is called "Ishusho" or the Virgin Mary statue at the Nyange centre? 
A.	Yes.  When you move out from the church, you follow a path that leads on to the main highway.  Now, when you use that path or that small path, you go past where the statue is located. 
Q.	So the facade or the front of the church that had the front door, in effect, faced that statue; correct? 
A.	That is correct, indeed.  It faced the main entrance. 
Q.	And that plaque was on that side you have just referred to, the front facade facing the statue? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	What would you say to the proposition that the plaque actually said "1943" as opposed to "53"?  How sure are you of the year?  It's already been 12 years, almost now, since then.  
A.	I know that the inscription was "1953". 
Q.	Did you go to that church in Nyange in 1993 and recall there being a jubilee celebration? 
A.	What I remember is that I went to the church in November, but I don't recall the date. 
Q.	My question was a little different.  It was, do you recall a jubilee being celebrated in '93 for Nyange church; yes or no? 
A.	No, I don't remember. 
MR. TOWNSEND: 
I'd ask that the Witness be shown what is called Prosecutor's Exhibit 3-29.  

If I could call on the help of the registry -- 3-29.  

If that photograph could be shown to the Witness.  It is, in fact, 2-29.  I misspelt.  So it is Exhibit 2-29. 

Thank you.  
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness, you are going to be shown a photograph, if you could take a look at it and tell us if you would agree with me that that appears to be a photograph of Nyange church and it says the word "jubilee" on the bottom showing that in 1993 it was celebrating its 50th anniversary?  Does that seem right to you?
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I object. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Monthé.  The basis for that objection?
MR. MONTHÉ:
No, it is the following -- my objection is grounded on the following; either the Prosecutor asks the witness to look at the picture and then questions will be put to the witness as to whether this was the Nyange church.  It has nothing to do with the jubilee, because it is a suggestion being made to the witness.  For instance, it is said that there was a jubilee -- it becomes a leading question, might I say.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
Do I actually understand the objection to be leading in cross-examination.  And if so, I 'm not sure Counsel understands the nature of cross.  

I'll wait for the ruling.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, did you hear the question or would you want it repeated? 
THE WITNESS:
You're talking about the question in connection with the jubilee, Madam?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That is it. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
Says Madam President.  
THE WITNESS:
I know nothing in connection with any jubilee, so I cannot provide any explanation in that regard. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, you want to show P. 2-29 to the witness?  You want to show him?  
MR. TOWNSEND:
Yes, if I could be allowed to proceed that way, Your Honour.  
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness, are you able to see that?  If you can -- if you can wait for my question.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness says, even if I'm shown the picture, I don't understand what it stands for.  
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Thank you for that.  Let me put a question to you.  I suggest to you that photograph shows Nyange church; what do you say to that? 
A.	I notice that that picture has nothing to do with the Nyange church.  Next to that church there, there's a small bush, whereas close to the Nyange church that I know of there were buildings. 
Q.	But what buildings were next to Nyange church; can you list them specific? 
A.	Close to the church there were secretaries who used to work with the priests.  There is a compound for the priests, there was a storey (sic) building.  All those buildings were on the right-hand side of the church, and even right now, I can -- I see a small bush on that same right-hand side of the church, and I'm rather surprised at that. 
Q.	And that photograph, Exhibit 2-29 in front of you, you would agree with me is showing a 50 year jubilee in the year 1993; what do you say to that? 
MR. MONTHÉ:
I object, Madam President.  The witness has already said on two occasions that he knows nothing of the jubilee and so that issue does not even arise anymore.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
I would just say, Your Honour, this is cross-examination and I'm allowed to put the proposition to the witness and have him give evidence from the witness stand.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, did you hear the Prosecutor's question? 
THE WITNESS:
He asked me a question in connection with some jubilee.  Quite honestly, I know nothing about a jubilee. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND: 
Q.	Does this photograph refresh your recollection that in 1993 Nyange church celebrated its 50th jubilee; yes or no? 
A.	It might be possible that some jubilee was celebrated.  I didn't go there, so I can't provide any explanation in that respect. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you, that's all I have with that photograph.  

I have taken the photocopy the Defence provided today and I have placed a circle around a portion of the facade and I would like to put this to the witness.  I'd ask that that photo be shown to the witness.  It bears a blue ink circle.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:  
Q.	And the question, Witness, is: looking at that photograph closely, and looking at the place that I have placed a blue circle, does this refresh your memory and would you agree with me that what I have placed a circle around is, indeed, the plaque to which you were referring that appears on the facade of Nyange church; yes or no?
A.	Yes, that plaque was also on the right-hand side.  But, I don't know whether the plaque that I spoke of is the same as what is circled here. 
Q.	Okay.  So now you're not sure; is that correct?  It could be that same plaque; did I understand you correctly? 
A.	I know that on the right-hand side there was a plaque, but I'm not able to decipher what you are showing me here to be able to understand. 
MR. TOWNSEND: 
Now, can the Witness at the same time be shown photograph 3-21?  

So both that photograph 3-21 and the photocopy can be shown at the same time, to the witness. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Now, Witness, I'd ask you -- would you agree with me that the photocopy I've put the circle on is, in fact, a photocopy of the same photograph which is marked as "3-21"; you would agree? 
A.	Well, what I notice is that it is the same thing -- the same picture. 
MR. TOWNSEND: 
Thank you very much.  That's all for those exhibits.  

I'd ask that the photocopy, since I've circled it and referred to it, be admitted as the next Prosecution exhibit.  I think it will facilitate the record, if there is no objection.  I think we are up to P. 49, but, I'm not positive.  It will be P. 48, I believe.  

The next photograph I'm going to refer to is 3-18, for the registry. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Hold a minute.  You asked for that document to be admitted.  Is that right; if I have understood you?  

Yes, Counsel Monthé, do you object?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, Madam President.  I'm wondering where the Prosecutor is going with this demonstration.  I mean, it is the same picture which was produced into evidence by the Prosecutor.  Now he picks up a photocopy, he circles the particular section, and he says that should also be admitted into evidence.  So, it sounds like a circus.  So I don't see any purpose for this document being admitted into evidence. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
Your Honours, we do not allow the witnesses to mark the original exhibit, so this is the only way that we can have that marking for the record.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now, did you find the number, for the Prosecutor?  

What is the number? 
MR. TOWNSEND:
Prosecutor's Exhibit 48.  Forty-eight, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, then, this document which is a photograph that was shown to the witness, which has a circle drawn by the Prosecutor, is admitted as Prosecution Exhibit No. P. 48.  Its probative value will subsequently be determined by the Court.  
(Exhibit No. P. 48 admitted)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Prosecutor. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
As I've indicated to the registry, if the witness can be shown Prosecutor's Exhibit 3-18 -- three dash eighteen.  A photograph of a truck, 3-18.  
BY MR. TOWNSEND: 
Q.	While we're waiting for that, I have a brief question.  Without mentioning the name of any schools, could you tell us how many years of education you would have had? 
A.	I didn't even step my foot in the first year of any school. 
Q.	Thank you.  

Witness, you're now being shown a photograph which is Prosecutor's photographic Exhibit 3-18, which is a pick-up truck.  You referred in your testimony to a white pick-up.  Is that the same pick-up truck that appears in that photograph about which you testified? 
A.	You are talking about the pick-up carrying people, moving around in the secteur, calling the people who were going to be used -- who were going to kill some other citizens?  
Q.	I think that was your testimony, yes.  Is that the same pick up? 
A.	It was a pick-up with a colour that was similar to this one, of the same colour as what appears in the picture. 
Q.	Sorry -- so are you able to tell us if it is the same vehicle, a different vehicle or you are not sure?  And I suggest to you that that is the same pick-up of Rwamasirabo.  
A.	It is a vehicle belonging to Rwamasirabo that was used. 
Q.	And about which you testified today; correct? 
A.	That's right.  The pick-up was used and we travelled around in that vehicle to pick up members of the population so they go and kill those who were in the church. 
Q.	That's all with that photograph, thank you.  

Witness, when you say "we went around", did you, yourself, get a ride in that pick-up truck? 
A.	No.  I did not get on board that pick-up.  
Q.	And do you recall the driver of that pick-up truck at one time that you saw was a guy named Jigoma, which I believe is J-I-G-O-M-A? 
A.	Yes, I do remember. 
MR. TOWNSEND: 
I just have another question or two on this pick-up and I'll be stopping there.  
BY MR. TOWNSEND: 
Q.	Can you name who else you saw in that pick-up truck?  Can you give us the names, please? 
A.	I saw Rushema, Anastase, in that pick-up.  That was the person I was able to identify. 
Q.	And you were unable to identify any others; is that your testimony? 
A.	I was not able to identify anyone else.  I was only able to identify Rushema. 
MR. TOWNSEND: 
That's my last question on the pick-up truck.  

I'll be changing subject, Your Honour.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecutor.  I think the parties, the interpreters and maybe the court reporters, I believe, had been consulted earlier as I had requested, so that we can resume duty at 1:30 p.m. and then adjourn at 3:30 and no later than that so that those who would want to attend the ceremony organised in rememberance of Gregory Lombardi, sorry -- on his behalf, then those who may wish to attend that ceremony are able to do so.  

So I would like to ascertain whether everyone is agreed with that arrangement? 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, Your Honours, naturally, the coordinator you sent to us, we agreed -- we agree.  We have to try and clear away the witness.  If we've brought him, it is for us to -- it is for us to clear this matter.  So we go along with the suggestion by the Office of the Prosecutor, naturally. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Monthé.  

So we now adjourn and we resume at 1:30, in just an hour.  Thank you, everyone. 
(Court recessed at 1235H) 
(Pages 29 to 34 by Eleanor Bastian)







(Court resumed at 1340H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is called to order.

We'd like to address the Defence.  There seems to be a little bit of a problem, in the sense that the Accused, Father Seromba, had his lunch rather late because there was an accident, evidently, with the vehicle that was supposed to bring him his lunch.  So if the Defence is in agreement, we can begin and he can join us at a later time when he has had his lunch.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, the Defence doesn't really feel concerned by the catering problem by the Tribunal.  The Accused is here within the buildings.  Well, if he hasn't had his lunch -- it's your decision, of course.  He should be present, in our opinion, but if the Chamber thinks that we can continue without him, then that's fine by us.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The Chamber is of the opinion that it will be a brief wait.  He's having his lunch as we speak, and we believe that he will be with us in a matter of minutes.  As a result, I think we can begin.  I don't think that it will get in the way of the proceedings, and it won't get in the way of Defence, or the Accused's rights, in fact.

Prosecutor, are you ready to proceed with your cross-examination of the witness?
MR. TOWNSEND:
Yes, Your Honour.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I'm ready.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you, again, Your Honours.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness, before we came to the break, you talked about seeing Rushema and Jigoma in a white pickup truck.  I neglected to ask you: on what day or dates did you see that?
A.	In fact, the vehicle started driving around on the 14th.  On the 15th and on the 16th, it was still moving around.
Q.	Thank you very much.  Today, you testified that everyone had to take part in the killings and you also said words to the effect that any able-bodied person had to go because the authorities are asking, and only those that were sick couldn't go.  You recall that testimony?
A.	Yes, I remember making that testimony.
Q.	And was it your observation on the 16th of April 1994 at Nyange parish that all of those attackers were actively participating in the attack?
A.	When I saw the crowd gathered at the church on the 16th, I noticed that each and every one of them were determined to do what they had come to do.
Q.	So when you say each and every one was determined to do what they wanted to do, you mean participate in the attack?
A.	Yes, all those people had the aim, the common aim, of doing what had to be done, and they all did.
Q.	And in light of that, are there -- was everyone participating, or was there also a large group of people just standing around and watching?
A.	At Nyange church, nobody had the force or the strength to kill at that time.  Most of us were observing the scene, but we weren't passive, as such.  We had to surround the church in order to make sure that nobody could escape.
Q.	Can you estimate the number of persons gathered to attack Nyange church on 16th?  Is it more than a thousand?  Would you give some estimate?
A.	If I were to provide you with an estimate, there were between 4,000 and 5,000 assailants.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Father Seromba, you may come in and sit down.

You may proceed, Prosecutor.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you very much, Your Honour.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Now, when you went to Nyange on 16 April, did you carry your machete?
A.	Yes, I had my machete.
Q.	And did you use the machete in any way on the 16th of April?
A.	 I didn't use my machete on that day, because the refugees at the church, when the church collapsed, it fell upon them, and as a result they died inside the church.
Q.	What was the ethnicity of those refugees that you've referred to?
A.	They were Tutsis.
Q.	You've said that you first saw Seromba in November '93 and that you occasionally went to Nyange church.  Can you give us an estimate of the number of times you would have gone to Nyange church and seen Seromba between the November '93 date and the death of the president in April '94?
A.	Between November '93 and the date of the president's death, I think I must have gone to the parish four times.
Q.	So do I understand correctly from your response, that you would have seen Seromba about four times, total, up until, say, the day of 16th of April 1994?
A.	Yes, that's correct.
Q.	And would you agree with me that in April 1994, a majority of the inhabitants of Kivumu commune were of the Catholic faith?
A.	Yes, I agree with you.
Q.	In light of the fact that the majority of Kivumu inhabitants were Catholics, would you agree with me that members of the Catholic clergy, including the priests, were respected by all members of the population?
A.	Father -- or, the priest was very much respected.  He was said to be the father, in inverted commas, of the parish.
Q.	And when you say "father" of the parish would that, in your view, make him the father of the parishioners, of those who went to Nyange church?
A.	He was the father of all those Christians who celebrated Mass - or, went to Mass in that parish.
Q.	So although Father Seromba would not have been a governmental or civilian authority, you'd agree that he would have held respect, esteem and authority over the inhabitants of Kivumu?
A.	Of course.  He was respected as a priest.
Q.	And you'd agree with me that, particularly on the grounds of the parish -- or, at the location of the parish, his authority would be even more respected?
A.	Are you talking about the geographical location of the parish?  Is that what you mean?
Q.	Yes.
A.	Do you mean that in view of the geographic location of the parish he was an even more respected figure?  I don't understand what you mean by that.
Q.	I'm sorry if the question was not clear.  My first question, which you answered yes, was, was he a respected person.  My question now is: he would wield even more authority when he was at the parish itself; correct?
A.	Of course, that's quite possible.
Q.	I want to see if I understand your testimony.  You said it was Ndahimana who met with the bulldozer driver and you did not hear what they said, and that was just before the bulldozer driver started his destruction.  Is that your evidence?
A.	Yes, that's what I said.
Q.	Was Kayishema, Fulgence, present at that time; did you see him?
A.	IPJ Fulgence Kayishema was also there.
Q.	And you'd agree with me at that location -- let me withdraw and rephrase.  The location where you saw the bulldozer driver, you'd agree with me that was on the side closer to the Kibuye-Gitarama highway?
A.	Yes, it is at that location where the bulldozer was parked.  It was parked on the small road leading to the major road towards Kibuye; that is, indeed, Kibuye-Gitarama highway.
Q.	Just to confirm: you are saying that the bulldozer was on the side of the church closest to that Gitarama-Kibuye highway?
A.	Yes, that's correct.
Q.	And of the 4,000 to 5,000 people that you have estimated as attackers gathered there and then, how many were standing on that side of the church where the bulldozer was?
A.	In actual fact, the state officials were standing next to the bulldozer.  They were talking, but I don't know what they were talking about, but members of the population were surrounding the church.
Q.	Can you name the state officials you have just referred to?
A.	I'm talking about Grégoire Ndahimana, who was the bourgmestre; and the IPJ, Fulgence Kayishema; Brigadier Mbakirirehe; Vedaste Murangwabugabo, deputy bourgmestre; and Philbert Kanani; and other figures of authority whose names I do not know.
Q.	And where were you standing, or if you could tell us how far away you were?
A.	Well, between myself and the figures of authority there was a distance of eight metres.
Q.	And if you are there amongst many people and you are not able to hear them, and Seromba was present and had his back to you, I submit that you may not have been able to see him.  Would you agree?
A.	I did not see Seromba because I was close to the entrance into the presbytery, and if he had gone out of the presbytery, I would have seen him since I was near the entrance.
Q.	You have just told us now you were by the entrance to the presbytery.  Do I understand that you were standing by the secretariat of Nyange parish at that time?
A.	Yes, that is where I was, and the secretariat was close to where I was standing.
Q.	And you'd agree with me that the bulldozer was, in fact, on the other side of the church at that time, being the side closest to the highway?
A.	When you talk about the church, right up to where the bulldozer -- or, bulldozers were parked -- if you are where the bulldozer was parked, you have a view of the house - or, houses that are close to the statue of the Virgin Mary.
Q.	Were you, with your own eyes, able to see the bulldozer when it first struck the walls of the church; yes or no?
A.	When the Caterpillar started pulling down the church, it did not come from near the bell tower.  I said that when the bulldozer started to demolish the church, it did not start from the side of the bell tower; it started demolishing the church from the other side.  And I had the view -- I could see the bell tower.
Q.	And you said you were making this observation from where you were standing next to -- very close to the secretariat; is that correct?
A.	When the Caterpillar started, it went by the left side.  It went along the other side, and once it got there, it started demolishing where I was on the side of the bell tower.
MR. TOWNSEND:
I'm going to ask that the photograph of the secretariat be shown to the witness to help him locate his position.  It may take a moment to go through the photos.

It's, in fact, Prosecutor's exhibit 301.  So I'd ask that that be shown around the room and then to the witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It's Exhibit P. 301.
MR. TOWNSEND:
I see that photograph is now being shown to the witness.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness, if you can look at that photograph, Exhibit P. 301, and tell us:  is that the secretariat to which you have just referred?
A.	To tell you whether it is the secretariat in question, I cannot recognise the photograph.  I can only identify where the secretariat was if I were to go to the location.  I wouldn't do it in the photograph.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Can you let him see it a little closer to his eyes?  I think he is straining.  Let him hold it, please.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Are you able to recognise that as the secretariat, or not?
A.	I'm under the impression that this is the secretariat in question.  I can recognise it from these trees that are standing near the secretariat.
Q.	And can you estimate from -- the number of metres from the steps of the secretariat you were standing on the 16th April 1994 when you said you heard -- or, when you said you saw Ndahimana talk to the bulldozer driver?
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I thought I heard "1993" and not 1994.  I wonder if it is a mistake.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, you said 1993 (sic), but we are dealing with 1994.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	I'll put the question to you again: can you tell us the number of metres, in your estimation, that you would have been standing on 16 April 1994 when you saw Ndahimana speak, but not hear the bulldozer driver? 
A.	I cannot give you an estimate in metres because I did not measure the distance.  But if I were to refer to the secretariat that is located near the entrance leading to the presbytery where I was standing, they were a little bit below on the side of the cypress trees that are behind the house and the buildings.
Q.	You'd agree with me that you were very close to the secretariat at that time, yes?
A.	Yes, I was near the secretariat and near the gate that leads to the presbytery.
Q.	You'd agree with me that from where you are standing near the secretariat, you would not have been able to see what was happening on the other -- or, opposite side of the church; is that correct?
A.	I said so, that I could not see what was happening on the other side of church, but the bulldozer left from the left side and started on the other side of the church, moving towards the bell tower.
Q.	So do I understand that you saw the bulldozer start to move from where you were standing and then, as it passed a corner of the church, you would have lost sight of it, just before?
A.	I did not see it because it came from the other corner - or, side and got to the bell tower, as the other side of the church that remained, that fell, but the bell tower remained standing, remained intact.
Q.	If you can listen closely to my question and try and answer: from where you were standing near the secretariat after that conversation you saw, you saw the bulldozer start to move, and as it turned a corner, around a corner of the church, you would have lost sight of it just before it started its destruction; is that correct?
A.	I had said that I saw it pass by, by the left side to go to the other side, but I did not see it being demolished, even if I could hear the rumbling of the engine or the noise that it was making.  But at a certain point I saw a portion of the church fall, while the bell tower remained standing and intact.
Q.	Thank you for that.  Just to confirm: at the moment the destruction of the church commenced by the bulldozer, you were able to hear it, but you didn't actually see it because you were on the other side of the church; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Now, you have mentioned before in Mbakirirehe, Vedaste Murangwabugabo.  Would you agree with me that they were leaders amongst other leaders of the attack on the 16th April 1994?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	Now, I'd like to go back a little bit before then, when you said that there was an order to bury also given by the bourgmestre.  Do you recall that testimony?
A.	Yes, I remember having said so.
Q.	Would you agree with me that you did not actually hear the words come out of the mouth of the bourgmestre, but that others told you that; is that correct?
A.	I said that it is the bourgmestre who gave the order to dig the pits in which those corpses would be buried because he was the person who was responsible for the attack.  I could say that he was presiding over the commune.  He was the president of the commune, as it were.
Q.	Now I understand how you have arrived at that conclusion, but my question is slightly different: did you hear the bourgmestre's words, yes or no, with regard to the burial?
A.	Could people have been buried while they were still alive?  Could they be buried before the church was demolished?
Q.	Let me make the question very simple to you.  The question, in direct, was put to you that the people buried under instructions, and you said the communal officials also gave instructions.  And then the next question was: were you referring to some all those communal officials?  And your answer was yes.  So I'm trying to understand: was it the bourgmestre or all of the communal officials?  What did you exactly hear, yourself?
A.	I am saying that the bourgmestre was the highest-ranking official amongst the others that were there, and I would say the others were following the orders that he was giving, since he was their line superior.
Q.	Did you see the bourgmestre, Ndahimana, carry a gun, yes or no?
A.	He did not have a gun, but those working under him were carrying guns.
Q.	And, yes or no, did you hear the bourgmestre say the words that related to the burial?
A.	I did not hear the words that were uttered by the bourgmestre.  But, upon analysis, you would realise that the order was given by him since he was the bourgmestre.
Q.	Now, Rukara that you've mentioned, did you see him have any grenades or use any grenades?
A.	No, I did not see him use the grenade.
Q.	And would you agree with me that the reservist and Rukara and the other one I think was Bonera, were active soldiers when they were participating in that attack?
A.	Rukara and Bonera are one and the same person.  The second person that I mentioned was Boniface Kabilisa.
Q.	And you'd agree that reservists were activated as soldiers at the time of the 16 April attack?
A.	Yes, they were ready and they were shooting at people.
Q.	Were they in military uniform?
A.	Kabilisa was the only person wearing a military shirt.
Q.	Did you at any time before you left see a door placed on top of the bulldozer in order to protect the driver, specifically, from falling stones from the tower?
A.	When the bulldozer approached or came close to the bell tower, a certain Tuyisenge, Innocent, came forward.  He was a teacher, and he took a plank that he put between the driver's head, and something else that he put up to protect the driver from falling, and the driver continued to pull down the church.
Q.	And you saw that yourself, with your own eyes?
A.	Yes, I was an eyewitness of this.
Q.	And would -- when you say "plank", you are talking about a piece of wood?
A.	It is a plank that looks like a -- that looks triangular in shape.
Q.	Did you specifically see Appollinaire Rangira, R-A-N-G-I-R-A, Rangira, firing a gun at the church on the 16th of April 1994?
A.	They were all communal policemen, but I did not know Rangira.  I knew him when I went to prison and I would say that all those persons had guns in their custody -- or, were in possession of guns, and they were firing at people.
(Pages 35 to 41 by Verna Butler)







1430H
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Now, you said that the Tutsi refugees were inside the church.  Had they barricaded the doors in order to impede people from gaining entry?
A.	The (unintelligible) inside the church.  And, when the church was being shot at, those who were firing forced open the doors in order to be able to come close to those people and shoot.  They had to break open the doors in order to shoot at those who were inside. 
Q.	When you personally were there participating in the attack, you were following instructions you had received? 
A.	When we arrived and met the officials on the spot, we were following -- we followed the orders that they gave us. 
Q.	What were the orders that you heard, personally?
A.	I heard gunshots, explosions, and for some of us that is the first time we were hearing such explosions.  Some of us tried to run away and the authorities or officials asked us to come back and not to go anywhere.  I think they wanted us to take part in the attack. 
Q.	I'm asking you specifically:  What did you understand or hear were your instructions with regard to the attack?
A.	Are you talking about the instructions, or the orders that were issued, or the ones that I heard with my own ears?  Is that what you're talking about?  
Q.	I'm asking you which instructions did you personally hear with regard to the attack at Nyange church upon your arrival there.
A.	I wasn't among those appointed to, say, receive orders.  It was the officials or authorities who were present who led or guided members of the population who were on the spot.  
Q.	So I understand your evidence is that you were guided by their acts and you followed with like acts.
A.	When you're asked to stand at a particular spot -- well, members of the population had nothing else to do.  They only needed to comply with the orders.  They were asked to be at a specific spot so as to ensure the refugees do not leave the church and run away.  So the authorities indicated to us - or, pointed out to us the places where we had to be so as to prevent the refugees from escaping. 
Q.	Did you ever go into the presbytery on 16th April 1994?
A.	Inside the presbytery?  
Q.	Yes.  My question is:  Did you go inside the walls of the presbytery or not?
A.	No, I did not go inside the presbytery.  
Q.	Some persons have said that survivors from the 16th April 1994 bulldozing were subsequently taken to the Nyange health centre.  Did you ever hear that information?
A.	I heard people say so because after the church collapsed the bulldozer removed all the dirt and refuse and the dead bodies.  It would appear survivors were also found, and those who -- were moved to the health centre, but then I learnt that those survivors were subsequently killed. 
Q.	Were you ever informed or did you learn of the approximate number of those survivors that left Nyange and were taken to the health centre?
A.	I wasn't told the number of persons who were evacuated. 
Q.	And it's my understanding that you were in the process of walking away from Nyange church and were at least a few hundred metres away when you heard the sound which you understood to be the collapse of the tower at Nyange; is that correct?
A.	That's correct, yes. 
Q.	So would you agree with me that you wouldn't be in a position to know, because you didn't see, that some of those survivors that were taken to the health centre may have included people that fell from the tower; is that correct?
A.	I did not quite understand your question, Counsel. 
Q.	You were not present when the tower fell; correct?
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And you learnt that there were survivors from the church destruction; correct?
A.	Let me say something about those who were pulled out of the church and taken to the health centre.  I heard mention made of those survivors, but I cannot say anything about it as an eyewitness.  
Q.	And --
A.	On the 16th -- well, on the -- I never heard anyone say that anyone survived that attack.  
Q.	Now, because you weren't an eyewitness to those persons being pulled out of the rubble, you're not in a position to tell us, either way, whether those survivors had, in fact, fallen from the tower; do you agree with that?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, you've already asked that question.  You've already put that question to the witness, haven't you?
MR. TOWNSEND:
Yes, but I am not sure I got a response, Your Honour.  I didn't hear one, at least, in English.  I'd just like him to get to a point where he is acknowledging his lack of observation of the survivors, including from the tower.  If you think it's clear, I can move on, Your Honour. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, the Prosecutor cannot compel the witness to get to a particular point.  All he has to do is ask questions and let the witness -- the witness's business is to answer.  He can't compel the witness to answer in a particular way.  That's the point of my objection. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
I'll withdraw the question and pose a slightly different one, if that is okay.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  You can proceed, Prosecutor, with some other question. 

BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Now, when you were asked earlier if someone could survive a fall from the tower, you said no.  And then you added, "Even if one had survived a fall from the tower the attackers would have finished them off."  Do you remember that testimony?
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	And you'd agree with me, then, that the people that, in fact, survived and were taken to the health clinic were not, in fact, finished off; correct?
A.	That's correct.  I do agree with you.  They were pulled out of the rubble and taken to the health centre, but subsequently they were killed.  
Q.	I'm sorry to jump back, but I just want to confirm one fact about -- around the time when you arrived.  Would you agree that when you arrived at about 9:00 the attack had already begun, or not?
A.	The attack had already begun when I got there.  
Q.	When you gave a statement to the Defence in August of 2005, do you recall if you signed it?
A.	Yes, I remember having placed my fingerprint on that document.  
Q.	And when you say "that document", you're referring to a written statement you gave to counsel for the Defence in August 2005?
A.	Yes, I did fingerprint that statement that I made.  
Q.	This is my last question, it is more out of personal curiosity.  On that last sentence of that statement, you said you would testify on behalf of Seromba even if it required going to the United States.  Do you have an interest in going to the United States?
A.	No.  It's not just a matter of testifying for Seromba.  Anyone who is falsely accused, I would be ready to testify for him wherever that person may be.   
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
Nothing further.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecutor.  

I suppose, it's Counsel Monthé.  Any re-examination of this witness?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Not at all, Madam President.  I'm grateful.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, this is the end of your testimony before this Court.  We thank you for having come here and for having answered the questions put to you.  We wish you a safe journey back home to your place.  
THE WITNESS:
I also thank you. 
(Witness excused) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is there a problem?  
THE FRENCH INTERPRETER:
No. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(French spoken)  Do you have any other witness other than FE34?  And that would be C23, I believe who were to appear, CF23.  Is he there?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
No, because it had been said that in view of the ceremony, I told Mr. Gogo that CF23 wouldn't need to be here.  So we're wondering whether we would need to question him this afternoon or interview him this afternoon.  It wasn't necessary.  That was our understanding.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That is not what we told Mr. Gogo.  We thought the witness would come, he would have to take his lunch, and it was envisaged that he was going to have his meal here and we would start.  We still have 45 minutes.  And that's what we asked for.  Oh, he's there?  Oh, I'm told he's there.  

We're checking whether the witness is present.  A couple of minutes and we'll decide.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, since we have some period allowed, I want to ask whether the Chamber had dwelt on that leave to meet Father Seromba, we're merely checking, those who have already testified.  I don't have an answer and we're about getting to the weekend and some of them might be leaving town.  So I'm wondering whether the Bench has dwelt on that matter.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You already made your request for the six witnesses.  As far as we're concerned, we have no problems with that.  We are in agreement that those witnesses before leaving town be able to meet Father Seromba, not meet him in a group -- we wanted them to meet him in a group because we wanted them to conclude their testimony.   
MR. MONTHÉ:
Very well, Madam President.  Thank you very much. 
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good day, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good day.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You're Witness CF23.  You're a Defence witness, a protected witness, and that's why you're appearing under a pseudonym, CF23.  You will be led in evidence by the Defence, cross-examined by the Prosecutor and, if need be, by the Bench and, subsequently, there might be re-examination by the Defence.  We ask you to listen attentively to the questions put to you and to answer them briefly and precisely.  We now ask you to make a solemn declaration. 
(Declaration made by Witness CF23 in Kinyarwanda) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  

Is it Mr. Nekuie?  No.  Mr. Monthé, then.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Just me, again, Madam President.  Obliged, Madam President.  

Madam President, if I can direct the court clerk to come up to me and take the personal identification sheet for CF23.
WITNESS CF23,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Good day, Witness CF23.
A.	Good day.  
Q.	CF23, I just want to be sure that you're in good health.  
A.	I'm fine.  No problem.  
Q.	Thank you.  CF23, the exercise we will embark on this afternoon will be made up of a number of questions and I'll ask you to answer in a brief and precise manner so that we can make progress.  If the question is not clear to you, I'll ask you to say so, so that I can rephrase it.  Do we agree on those rules of the game?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, based on that, could you then look carefully at the sheet before you and point out if they comply - or, tally with your identity.  
A.	Yes, I've just perused the document, and all the particulars therein contained tally with my identity.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness CF23.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, Your Honours.  Now, based on that confirmation by Witness CF23, can I pray that you admit this document as a Defence Exhibit under D. 74; if the Court pleases.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No objection by the Prosecutor?  None.  

This document, which is the personal identification sheet of Witness CF23, is admitted as Defence Exhibit D.74.  It will be placed under seal.  
(Exhibit No. D. 74 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
You may continue, Counsel Monthé.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  

Madam President, Your Honours, I would like to start this discussion with CF23 in closed session so that his identity is not revealed, if the Court is satisfied with that procedure. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No objection by the Prosecutor?  None.  No objection by the Bench.  We now proceed to a closed session to ensure that the witness's identity is protected and in the interest of justice. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 48 to 53] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
