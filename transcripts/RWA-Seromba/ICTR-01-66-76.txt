MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, we will continue hearing the parties' final arguments.  We, therefore, will now pray the Defence to continue making their final submissions.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, Madam President, the Defence (unintelligible) wishes to point out to the Trial Chamber that you are obviously sitting under 15 bis.  I should like to read Article 15 bis before we begin the hearing.  
Article 15 bis says: 

"Absence of a Judge.  

"(A) When a judge may not sit in any case in which" -- oh, sorry -- 

"If (A) a Judge is, for illness or other urgent personal reasons, or for reasons of authorised Tribunal business, unable to continue sitting in a part-heard case for a period, which is likely to be of short duration; and two, the remaining judges of the Chamber are satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to do so, those remaining judges of the Chamber may order that the hearing of the case continue in the absence of that judge for a period of not more than five-working days."

And, then, sub (b):  

"If, 1, a judge is for illness or urgent personal reasons  or for reasons of authorised Tribunal business unable to continue sitting in a part-heard case for a period which is likely to be of short duration; and two, the remaining judges of the Chamber are not satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to order that the hearing of the case continue in the -- in the absence of that judge then ..."   I won't read the rest, because it doesn't concern ... "but those remaining judges may, nevertheless, conduct those matters which they are satisfied it is in the interests of justice that they be disposed of notwithstanding the absence of that judge and the presiding judge may adjourn the proceedings."

Now, I won't read any more, but it is obvious that Judge Kam is not here.  We had a programme; I have the document in hand.  It was to be held from the Tuesday the 27th to Friday the 30th of June.  This is the document.  And we, the Defence, have noted that since the beginning of the trial -- have not been able to undertake our task fairly.  

If you have undertaken your responsibilities, we have equally.  And, we have raised a motion in that regard and the Appeals Chamber is examining the matter.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could the registry please show us the document Counsel Monthé is referring to because all the documents we have state the 27th and not from the 27th to the 30th, and we should like to see this document, from whence it comes.  

This document you showed us has, of course, nothing to do with the actual hearings.  It is -- the -- a question of -- an instruction to the commander of UNDF to make Seromba available.  It's got nothing to do with the hearings.  It's not a document that we've received.  

But we, however, all received a document where it was stipulated that the closing arguments would take place yesterday, the 27th, and we were not able to finish.  

So we will now adjourn the hearing for five minutes.  We will see, with our assistants, how we are going to proceed.  Five minutes. 
(Court recessed from 0917H to 0945H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session.  

We have tried -- because in the spirit of reconciliation, if possible, to have Kam with us this morning.  But he is sitting in Karemera and he tells us that he cannot come to sit in Seromba.  

Yesterday, we did announce that, in view of the fact that we were not able to terminate the final submissions, we were obliged to sit today, but on the basis of Rule 15 bis.  We -- and we couldn't do otherwise.  This was done to assist the Defence who asked for an excessively long time to make their final submissions.  We took account of the interests of justice and we are obliged to continue with the present hearing. 

That, therefore, is what we have to say.  Now, indeed, it is up to the two Judges to consider what are the interests of justice, and we feel that it is proper to continue.  The Judge who is absent will, in any case, be able to read the transcripts -- the records.  

And now we give the floor to Counsel Nekuie.  And we remind you that you have two and a half hours to finish making your final submissions.  And, if after that, the Prosecution wishes to respond, they will have half an hour to do so.  And should there be a rejoinder from the Defence, they will have one further half hour.  

Counsel Nekuie, you have the floor.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, Your Honours, good morning.  

Let me reassure you, Madam President, we have had the opportunity to look through the document that we had submitted earlier as our final brief.  And, indeed, we have noticed that the matters on which I dwelt yesterday in the course of my submissions were more or less superfluous in view of the fact that they had already been reflected in the document in your possession.  

So, this morning, I do not intend to go back on those issues.  For instance, a critical analysis of the indictment, and I was able to note that with respect to the analysis of the additional evidence proposed by the Prosecutor in his final brief -- well, these have been dealt with, for instance, under Count 4 in the indictment; in other words, crimes against humanity.  I will, rather, dwell this morning on evidence regarding Count 1, 2, and 3.  And, then, I'll carry out an analysis of the testimonies provided by the various parties before your court.  

It is my hope that I will conclude within the time that you have allotted me, whereas the Defence would have wanted -- even though the Defence would have wanted to operate freely without having a rope tied around its neck.  

Your Honours, I would like to say that the parties, in my view, do agree on at least one point that emerges from the submission made by Office of the Prosecutor with respect to the indictment.  It is clear, at the very least, in light of the provisions governing proceedings before your Court that the matters brought before you are solely those mentioned in the indictment:  The mode of participation attributed to the Accused or charged with -- with which the Accused is charged are those that appear in the indictment.  

Our concern would be to look at matters that are not quite clear.  Your Honours, we need to look at the evidence.  In doing so, the purpose of that exercise should not be to submit new facts or new proposals to your Court.  I suppose that was the conclusion of Madam Althea Alexis (sic) regarding the indictment.  

So I wanted to make these clarifications so as to draw your attention, Your Honours, to the fact that the evidence, which were submitted on by the Office of the Prosecutor, should not be upheld - or, should be upheld -- unless their purpose is to distort the factual evidence that appears there. 

Now, Defence would like -- 

MS. ARBIA:
Sorry to come in -- and my apologies to my colleagues of the Defence -- merely to draw the attention of the Court and that of the Defence to the discussions on the evidence -- just to draw attention to the fact that these witnesses are protected witnesses.  All that has been done -- like, for instance, we're looking to the final brief -- both those that have been submitted, those that have been proposed without being submitted, the Defence has highlighted information or some -- yes, some information that might reveal the identity of the witnesses.  

It -- it would be better not to reveal information or provide information that would reveal the identity of the witnesses.  My apologies once more.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, well, we're moving from one surprise to another -- one incident to another.  Because I noticed that the Prosecutor now arrogates to herself the powers of your Court to issue instructions to me -- counsel on what I should said -- I should say in the course of my closing statements.  That's rather strange.  

I don't want to engage or dwell on this polemic with the Prosecutor.  And, there are pseudonyms there.  And the Defence is aware of this.  I don't understand this kind of unwarranted interference by the Prosecutor while I'm submit -- making my closing -- I think it warrants some caution on the part of 
the -- of -- of the Court.  And I think this should be done, sir -- done, madam. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I would urge some measure of calm among the parties.  Fortunately, this is the last day.  We don't have that much time to round up our debates here.  If there is anything whatsoever I would prefer, Prosecutor, that you address the Court to point out a particular problem -- this or that problem. The same should apply to the Defence.  So let us avoid interrupting the person or the party addressing the Court.  Thank you.  

Counsel Nekuie, you may continue. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Obliged, Madam President.  

Madam President, now, based on submissions made to your Court by the Office of the Prosecutor in connection with the facts, as we say, it can be summarised in a few words.  Father Athanase Seromba, according to the Prosecutor, was in charge of the Nyange parish and, therefore, was vested, as it were, in the eyes of the Prosecutor, with the powers of the parish priest.  And it is in that capacity that 
Father Seromba allegedly or had allegedly incited those perpetrators of the massacres in the Nyange church to carry out the massacres.  And that's why the -- in tandem with the authorities of the commune, Father Seromba is alleged to have planned the extermination of the Tutsis in that commune at that church in Nyange.  

So that's basically the information that for -- the Prosecutor will want you to have -- uphold against Father Seromba.  But following an analysis, you would be required to consider two hypotheses and I submit them respectfully.  

First one:  We are of the view that we have to deal with the parish priest.  And, therefore, that parish priest is vested with powers linked to his pastoral duties.  And we find ourselves in 1994 -- that is, in Rwanda, and the laws governing the powers or authority that someone might have when it comes to security, and safety and the management of persons is that of the law of 23 November 1963.  And the bourgmestre, according to that law, is the most powerful person who deals with the administration of the commune and security matters.  

The authority responsible for law and order enforcement within the gendarmerie is someone who is -- who comes under the decree of 1994.  You are well aware of how these missions or assignments are carried out by the gendarmes as provided under the law.  The question that I put to you under that hypothesis -- namely, of a parish priest in those circumstances -- the question I put to you is to know whether that parish priest, considering his influence -- influence even over the authorities could de facto seize or arrogate to himself the powers that are incumbent of the -- on the said authorities on the basis of that instrument -- legal instrument that I've read out to you.  

Can a parish priest be vested with the powers to issue orders -- even de facto orders to gendarmes and communal authorities?  

Well, considering the fact that this is not a parish priest preparing what -- or planning anything whatsoever with those authorities, his influence -- well, does -- does that influence allow him to prohibit access to his parish by the authorities as alleged by -- by -- by the Prosecutor, who suggests that once one is a parish priest he's the -- that parish priest is the owner of the church of the parish.  

Now, we need to go further than that.  In the event such prohibitions could be suggested by the priest to authorities in the commune -- now, does that parish priest have the right?  Is he even able to impose such prohibition?  Is he in a position to prevent them from performing? 

Well, I submit, Madam President, Your Honours, this is not possible in view of the fact that the parish is within the area of jurisdiction of the said authorities.  It's, rather, the reverse that would be correct.  In other words, that parish priest, though not involved in the event that might occur in the church, might be required to even ask the authorities without having the means to prevent them.  

So that is the position of the Prosecutor and which we challenge.  And which -- which we want to extinguish through the submissions we are making.  Because according to the Prosecutor the parish priest would be an accomplice of the authorities in view of his presence within the parish.  

But there is no doubt, Madam President, based on the initial hypothesis that I've just pointed out that the Prosecutor -- to prove complicity on the part of Father Seromba in that parish, the Prosecutor would need to produce evidence of unquestionable reliability.  

In other words, he could not prevent -- that parish priest could not prevent -- the authorities could not prevent the assailants from being in his parish in spite of any de facto powers he might have.  What is the evidence, then -- that is in support of that second hypothesis, namely, of an accomplice as suggested by the Prosecutor?

Among the evidence reference is made to the attacks perpetrated within the Kivumu commune almost immediately after Habyarimana's death, which occurred in the night of the 6th of April 1994.  And the Prosecutor makes mention of killings, attacks carried out at the house of someone by the name Ndakubana; reference to the death of Martin Karekezi and that of Thomas Mwendezi in Murambi and Kivumu.  

My hope is that the court -- the court reporters won't have any problem taking down those names otherwise I might need to spell them.  Are we fine?  Can we continue without me having to spell the names?  Fine then, very well.  

So those are the cases that are referred to Madam President, Your Honours and in regard to which 
we - or it is felt that somehow Father Seromba was involved.
(Pages 1 to 6 by Jean Baigent)










1000H 
MR. NEKUIE (continuing): 
Witnesses bearing the pseudonyms YAT, CDL, and CDG were required to testify, and these appear in your records.  Madam President, you have the reports on the examination and cross-examination of those witnesses.  You would notice, when looking at those records, that there is nowhere reference made to the involvement of Father Seromba in any manner whatsoever in the killings mentioned in the Kivumu commune just after the death of President Habyarimana, at least in respect of the cases mentioned by the Prosecutor.  Mention is made of Ndungutse and others.  No reference is ever made to Father Seromba.  So it lies with your Chamber to assess the reliability of that evidence which, might I say, is pure hearsay evidence.  They are not eyewitnesses to what had occurred.  So that is one point on which we are making our observations. 

Further, the Prosecutor argues that with respect to the transfer of Tutsis to the Nyange church, that there again is a factor in the planning that has been orchestrated by Father Seromba and his co-perpetrators.  And the evidence he submits are those from Witnesses CBL, CBN, and CBI. 

Now, in the course of their giving of evidence, Madam President, it does happen also that the Prosecutor himself did acknowledge that the -- it was -- in order to escape from the killings that occurred in the commune, that the Tutsis, on their own, decided to come and seek refuge or sanctuary at the Nyange church.  So there was no invitation from Father Seromba for them to come to his church. 

Now, regarding the transfer of those people who found themselves occasionally at the communal office and then in the Nyange parish, now those who moved from the communal office to the Nyange parish, well, all the testimonies do point to the fact that the bourgmestre and police inspector, Kayishema, were involved, and nowhere is there any reference to the involvement of Father Seromba in those operations regarding the transfer of the Tutsis. 

Now, as for Defence witnesses who appeared here at the request of Defence, provided eloquent testimony in that regard.  I don't wish to make mention of them and be going back to their testimony or evidence out of fear or out of concern of going beyond the time allotted us by your Court.  Suffice it to say that we are fully confident in your Court in your assessment of those testimonies provided by parties in the course -- that will be done in the course of your deliberations naturally. 

It does happen, with respect to that second operation, Madam President, that proof was not adduced in a manner that is not subject to dispute, in other words, beyond any reasonable doubt, that 
Father Seromba was the person who ordered any killing or transfer.  It is clear, in fact, based on allegations by the Prosecutor, that those who sought sanctuary or refuge at the Nyange church found themselves there on their own initiative.  As for the transfer from the communal office to the Nyange church, Father Seromba was in no manner involved or responsible for that operation. 

Then there is the alleged dismissal of Tutsi employees by Father Seromba.  Here these allegations are drawn from testimonies -- from the testimony of Witness CBK.  But that witness does not tell you the circumstances under which those dismissals occurred.  He does not say that these were facts told him by the persons concerned.  Nothing -- absolutely nothing, Madam President, in the evidence tendered by the Prosecutor -- the fact that that really occurred. 

In fact, the Defence brought Witness MA1, who was present at the Nyange church, together -- ************************ Father Seromba, and he was there with Father Seromba, and he clearly stated that that kind of dismissal never occurred. 

The Prosecutor wasn't able to rebut that testimony.  The conclusion in the eyes of the Defence is that that fact is a fabrication or some figment of the person who had made that allegation. 

As to the allegation that Seromba gave a list of Tutsi to the bourgmestre, for these people to be sought out and taken to the church, is another allegation that the Prosecution has obtained from one witness, who claimed having -- to have given the name -- CBI, who is to have given the names to Seromba.  But that witness also, throughout his testimony, Madam President, was not able to tell the Court or enlighten us as to how and under what circumstances Father Seromba obtained those names.  How was the list sent -- get from Seromba's hands to that of the bourgmestre?  Did he give them the names in the presence of other people, and were those people able to give you the names of -- to make the testimony credible?  None of those details were provided when that witness testified, and he's the only one to speak of a list, since all the witnesses, both Prosecution and Defence, that spoke before you did not corroborate that. 

So, Madam President, that is a fact which, in our eyes and in light of the relevant provisions of the rules, can never be taken into account because it was not corroborated by an independent source. 

Finally, the -- the Prosecution, to establish Seromba's responsibility with a charge of genocide, that he held a series of meetings between the 10th and 14th of April 1994.  As regards the meeting of the 10th of April 1994, the alleged meeting, we sustain, it was Witness AT that appears to have reported that meeting -- YAT, sorry.  

But how does he speak of it?  He said that it was Kayishema, the inspector, who the next day had informed him that a planning meeting was held at Nyange church after an initial meeting at which he himself -- which he himself had attended.  He gives no details as to that first meeting, which he attended -- which he allegedly attended, and it is incredible that the witness who considers that he -- did not trust Kayishema at all, who considered Kayishema to be one of the planners, claims that it is the same planner who comes out of a meeting on the 10th of April and comes to tell him that a planning meeting was held and where it was allegedly decided to exterminate him, the witness, YAT, and his family.  

This, again, Madam President, is a testimony that's corroborated by no other testimony, nor in any independent source, and consequently, that meeting is a pure fabrication. 

The meeting of the 11th of April 1994, indeed it was a meeting held at the communal office, according to the testimony of those who attended, the Defence witness, FE27, as part of the normal activities of the commune, a meeting held to discuss the PNAS, which is some sort of development programme, I think, so as not to say something untrue.  But the testimony of Witness FE27, FE27, are quite clear as to the purpose of the meeting, and it was -- it was transformed into an emergency meeting by the bourgmestre because of the insecurity in the commune. 

The Prosecutor, through their Witness CDL, claimed that Seromba took part in that meeting, which was also a planning meeting -- meeting for planning the extermination of the Tutsis.  But several witnesses, apart from FE27 -- CF23, for example, FE13, and many others -- have told you, Madam President, in the course of their testimony, that Father Seromba never took part in that meeting. 

Moreover, it emerges from the testimony of all the witnesses in respect of that meeting that who attended the meeting were the -- were Tutsi authorities in the commune.  The names were given in the course of their testimony.  I do not need to give those names here because I do not want to create difficulties for some people, but among those authorities were one of the survivors who often comes here in the context of his professional activities.  

So it is clear, Madam President, that that meeting was not a meeting for planning extermination of Tutsi, since they themselves took part.  And Witness CDL did not attend and cannot, therefore, tell you exactly what was discussed at that meeting. 

Consequently, Madam President, since this is hearsay evidence, completely refuted by numerous Defence witnesses, the meeting of the 11th of April 1994 cannot be retained as evidence of the Prosecutor's allegations in respect of planning, at least as far as Seromba is concerned. 

As to the other meetings, Madam President, I don't think I need to speak of them at length, whether it's the meeting of the 12th of April, the 13th of April, or the 14th of April, because when you read the testimony of the witnesses as to those alleged meetings, Madam President, Your Honours, you will note, first of all, that they never were -- they never attended the meetings, firstly.  

Secondly, they can't tell you how the meetings were held and what was discussed at those meetings.  They merely tell you throughout their testimony, "I saw Seromba with one or another of the communal authorities.  They spoke together for 15 or 20 minutes," and according to the witness it is a meeting for planning or organising the massacre that took place.  Well, that is not credible testimony, madam, as regards meetings -- planning meetings. 

Consequently, the Defence maintains, Madam President, Your Honours, that it was not established by the Prosecution beyond all reasonable doubt that Father Athanase Seromba, through meetings, in any way colluded with the perpetrators of the tragic events at Nyange. 

And then the Prosecution wants to propose evidence as to the positive acts committed by 
Father Seromba which would sustain the accusation of genocide:  His refusal to say the mass for the Tutsi.  But also, Madam President, it emerges from the record from the testimony of Prosecution witnesses and Defence witnesses that there were many refugees at Nyange parish, that the church was practically overrun; and objectively, under such circumstances, how would you expect the mass to be celebrated?  And if you can't celebrate mass in those conditions, can you consider that it is a criminal act on the part of the clergyman in respect of the people there?  We leave it to the Bench to weigh the reliability of such an allegation. 

We merely wish to recall, Madam President, Your Honours, that we have called Witnesses BZ3, BZ14, BZ5, and BZ4, who sufficiently enlightened us on that matter, explaining that as regards the entire Nyange secteur, Athanase Seromba had ceased -- after the 11th of April ceased saying mass, so that after the 14th -- 11th of April.  

So the fact that he did -- no longer said the mass was not exclusively, again, an act directed against the Tutsi in the parish, but a state of affairs before which he found himself and obliged him to suspend officiating at that time of disturbance.  Those witnesses were BZ3, BZ14, BZ5, and BZ4. 

The Prosecution otherwise alleges that Father Seromba told the assailants to wait until they were numerous enough.  This is from testimony of YAU and CDR.  But then again, Madam President, in studying that testimony, you will see nowhere that -- that there are words that they heard -- that they claim to have heard Seromba utter before them.  These again are allegations that they are making as a pure supposition.  So before such testimony, can your Trial Chamber consider that 
Father Athanase Seromba addressed the assailants?  

Moreover, Your Honours, from the Prosecution's own submissions it emerges that there was a great clamour at Nyange parish at the time.  The assailants were singing war songs.  How, then, under such conditions, can a refugee come and maintain before you that, at the same time as the singing he could, under all -- behind all the clamour hear what Seromba was saying?  And that, moreover, is valid for all the other Prosecution allegations as to utterances that -- by Father Seromba, because manifestly and from their own description of the situation in which the refugees were at the time, one couldn't hear what was being said by one or another person there.  There was so much clamour, it was deafening, there were war songs.  So this is another allegation that could not be established before your Court, Madam President, and cannot, therefore, be retained by you under that charge. 

It is alleged, Madam President, by the Prosecution that Father Seromba sequestered the Tutsi in the church at Nyange.  And to support that, the Prosecution claims that the church was surrounded by militiamen and assailants and that the gendarme prevented the refugees that were there to exit if they wanted to. 

The Defence called many witnesses on these allegations, and it emerged from the testimony of the Defence witnesses that the refugees were free to move until the 14th of April 1994.  The Defence also established -- and in any case the Prosecution could not establish before this Court by what authority Father Seromba would have given an order to the assailants, militiamen, and the gendarme, to come and encircle the church and prevent the -- and surround the church and prevent the refugees from running away. 

The Prosecutor was not able to tell you whether Father Seromba -- at least they produced no evidence, no proof, no proof, allowing you to establish that, because of his political or other activities, 
Father Seromba was the leader of the militiamen who were encircling -- surrounding the church.  

According to the Prosecution theory, his de facto position as a clergyman cannot be due to such a conclusion to the extent that it is established in respect of the events at Nyange that it was not the parishioners -- Father Seromba's parishioners who were surrounding the church, but militiamen and assailants coming from all over, and mainly from Kilikibira (phonetic), which is -- does not fall under Father Seromba's pastoral activities. 

Therefore, it is clear that, as Father Seromba had no authority, either over the communal authorities or over the assailants, because it has not been established that he were -- engaged in any form of political activities before the events.  He could not be in charge of the encirclement of the refugees at that time, and consequently, that allegation also does not hold. 

Finally, Madam President, the Prosecutor in his factual allegations said that Father Athanase Seromba engaged in the disarming of the refugees.  These allegations were made by one of his witnesses.  I can't find reference to him in my notes, but you do have that testimony in your record, 
Madam President.  And that witness claimed that after collecting those weapons, father -- those weapons were taken to the communal office for distribution to militiamen. 

The same Prosecutor calls some other witness, and I'm referring to Witnesses CDL and CD -- CBR.  Now, this latter witness says, rather, that the weapons collected were stored at the presbytery.  I think it is from there that those weapons were distributed to the assailants. 

Now, on the basis of those inconsistencies alone, that allegation regarding the disarming of the refugees is a mere fabrication.  As a result, Defence submits that based on the positive conduct allegedly carried out by Father Seromba, no proof was provided by the Prosecutor beyond any reasonable doubt. 

Regarding the moral aspect of that crime for which Father Seromba stands charged, the Prosecutor seems to want to provide proof through the demeanour of Father Seromba at the time or through statements or pronouncements that he might have made or through the commitment that he showed in the performance or in the demolition of the church and the killing of the refugees who were there.  

Well, there again, on this particular point, Madam President, none of the testimonies proposed would allow your Court to come to the conclusion that those statements or demeanour are attributed to 
Father Seromba actually saw the light of day.  No testimony points out the circumstances under which any such pronouncement was made.  No one talks exactly of how Father Seromba was dressed, was attired.  So there is no evidence about the circumstances under which Father Seromba made those pronouncements. 

There again, therefore, the Prosecutor failed with that evidence to prove beyond any reasonable doubt the criminal intent of Father Seromba in the course of those events in Nyange.  Defence accordingly submits, Madam President, Your Honours, that that count cannot stand against Father Seromba. 

Count 2, complicity in genocide, which the Prosecutor brings before this Court.  Since he feels that Count 1 having been proven, Count 2 cannot stand because it cannot be an accumulation of such charges, and therefore, he's suggesting that in the event Father Seromba is found guilty under Count 1, Count 2 would not stand as complicity.  But we submit that the facts -- or the evidence being adduced was exactly the same as in Count 1, and the same observations made by the Defence regarding 
Count 1 should apply to Count 2 and, therefore, that it should be set aside. 

As for Count 3, conspiracy with a view to committing genocide, the facts are again the same.  And here the Prosecutor merely narrates the phases of implementation of that extermination plan agreed upon by Father Seromba and his co-perpetrators.  It would appear that that was supposed to have occurred on three -- in three phases.  

But before you look at that plan alleged by the Prosecutor, it will be necessary for the Prosecutor to prove to you beyond any reasonable doubt that Father Seromba was party to such a plan.  That could not have been proven through the meetings alluded to under Count 1, to the extent that we were able to provide evidence, information, to show that these meetings were nothing else but a mere fabrication, apart from the meeting that took place on the 11th of April 1994, whose purpose was not the planning or the killings in Nyange. 

Consequently, Defence do not -- does not intend to dwell unduly on this count, having proven the weakness of the submissions of the Prosecutor.  In that regard, your Court is referred to the evidence as adduced under Count 1.  The conclusion that you have to draw with respect to Count 1 definitely would apply to Count 3.  It is the hope of the Defence that your Court cannot but register the absence of any proof beyond any reasonable doubt of Father Seromba's involvement in the commission of those crimes. 

Madam President, in connection with Count 4 and in regard to which the Prosecutor refers your Court, our intention is to demonstrate the weakness of what is proposed by the Prosecutor in our final brief, which is in your possession.  I will not, therefore, dwell on that count.  

I would have a wish to sum up our position.  First of all, regarding the allegations made by the Prosecutor, let me draw your -- the attention of your Court to the fact that under this count, you are only allowed to consider the Prosecutor's allegations on two specific matters raised in the indictment, namely, Father Athanase Seromba's participation in the attack of the 15th of April and participation which took the form of the order that the doors of the church be shot, at the time when the refugees were retreating in order to escape from the attacks carried out by the assailants, and then the order allegedly issued by Father Seromba to the driver of the bulldozer, namely, to destroy the church or demolish the church the next day, 16th of April. 

Madam President, Your Honours, regarding this count specifically, we did call before you here the driver of the bulldozer himself, and you heard what he had to say in connection with the order to demolish the church.  He was quite clear that that order was not issued to him by 
Father Athanase Seromba.  He was unequivocal with respect to the allegations attributed to him by the Prosecutor, that is, based on previously statements.  He did narrate the circumstances under which he made those allegations.  And be that as it may, Madam President, it was -- he was testifying under oath in this state of contrition, and I believe there is nothing more reliable than his testimony or evidence before your Court on this matter.  

It is my belief, Madam President, Your Honours, when we talk about the order to demolish the church, there cannot be any doubt to be entertained in regard to who issued the order and that that person was not Father Athanase Seromba.  I believe that is a finding that needs to be upheld by your Court. 

Madam President, those are the main comments or observations that the Defence intended to make with respect to the factual allegations made by the Prosecutor so as to have you uphold 
Father Athanase Seromba's responsibility under Count 4 of the indictment that is submitted for your appraisal. 

Now, in order to round up our submissions, Madam President, in view of the fact that your Court set aside our corrigendum, I would like to very quickly go through the testimonies proposed by various parties, but I will dwell slightly on what Defence had to say in writing. 

Regarding Prosecution witnesses, Prosecutor called 14 witnesses before your Court, 12 of whom were so-called factual witnesses, a witness who was a journalist, Mr. Emisaye (phonetic) -- sorry, an investigator by the name Rémy Sahiri, a journalist, an official of the Italian government.  So three witness who had no business with the facts who were not eyewitnesses -- or factual witnesses, sorry.  

Now, regarding Witness Sahiri, he testified between 27 and 28 September 2004.  He talks about Nyange, the venue where these incidents occurred, and he provided some objective information or evidence.  

Witness YAU, that's Prosecution witness, testified on the 29th and 30th of September 2004 and similarly on the 1st of October 2004.  YAU has that specificity of having testified in the course of the Kibuye trial in Rwanda and during the trial of Father's Jean François Kayiranga and Nturiye in regard to events that occurred at Nyange parish.  She also testified -- or appeared as civil party accusing Father Kayiranga on facts that today she attributes -- she attempts to attribute to Father Seromba.  She said before the Court that she never complained or filed any charges against Father Kayiranga.  And in the course of the cross-examination, it was proven that what she was saying -- what she was alleging was a lie.  Subsequently, it was shown that indeed he had -- she had had to testify in the course of the Kibuye trial against Father Kayiranga.  

Witness YAT testified on the 29th and 30th of September 2004.  He also testified at the Kibuye trial and even assisted (unintelligible), and he also accused Father Kayiranga of the same facts in Kibuye.  And I need to point out, Madam President, that it was established that Father Kayiranga was acquitted of the charges brought against him by this witness.  It was on the basis of a judgement delivered by the Ruhengeri court of appeal.  I believe that was one of the exhibits tendered to your Court by the Defence. 

(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under separate cover). And he was the only one who made mention of the meeting of 10th April 1994.  
MS. ARBIA: 
I need to interrupt because we now face a situation.  The -- he's referring to witnesses that are protected.  So if we need further explanation, I would ask for a closed session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We do note that there's some information that might reveal the identity of the witness when the position occupied by the witness is specified.  We order, therefore, that it be deleted from the record, reference *************************************. 
MS. ARBIA: 
That's the reason why I came in earlier to say if there is any violation, some cure should be provided since we're in open session.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Again, I would urge calm again on the part of the parties and to avoid making unwarranted observations.  If there is any problem, that should be brought to the attention of the Bench, and the matter will be resolved.  Let's be careful also not to provide any information that might reveal the identity of protected witnesses. 

Counsel Nekuie, you may proceed.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, before proceeding, I would all the same want to say, if there is any violation, it is on the part of the Prosecutor regarding this particular point because in his final brief he intended for the public, not the one produced under the seal of confidentiality.  It is stated that this witness was ***************, so I cannot understand that I am the person who is in breach, whereas I'm picking it up from the final brief of the Prosecutor.  

MADAM PRESIDENT:
For now, we are ruling on what is happening here in court.  It goes without saying that if, in the final briefs, we notice that there is a problem that we can point out, reference is made to the seal of confidentiality in the document of the Prosecutor.  This is not made available to the public, of course.  
MS. ARBIA: 
It does happen.  We might have made mistakes, but if these are pointed out by the Defence, it will even be there in some other portions of our final brief.  We will act.  We will be grateful to the Defence.  We have tried to check all those portions of the final brief that will be made available to the public and to delete or redact those sections that might reveal the identity of the witnesses.  And that's why we made the comment that those sections that involve protected witnesses should be deleted.  
MR. NEKUIE:
That's what you should have asked for, instead of characterising the Defence as some expert in violating the rules. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No, please.  We should not dwell on this matter.  Our attention should be drawn to such matters as much as possible, let me say, any information that might reveal the identity of a witness, in view of the fact that the Bench itself has had to identify some problems in the document.  So we expect you to communicate any problems you might have noticed yourselves, and the Trial Chamber is committed to clarifying such matters. 

Counsel Nekuie, please proceed.  
MR. NEKUIE:
I was saying -- obliged, Madam President.  I'm saying that this witness is the only who admits having made reference to the meeting of the 10th of April 1994.  And no witness, no other information has been provided to substantiate or corroborate that evidence.  He says that the person who replaced Father Seromba was present at the parish and that he never saw him.  So the question is, how could Father Seromba hold meetings at the parish without being accompanied by the person who was supposed to replace him?  

So that's a witness whose credibility should be viewed with a pinch of salt, especially as at the same time he says he did not trust Inspector Kayishema.  He submits that he was the one who told him that a planning committee had taken -- meeting had taken place on the 10th of April 1994. 

Then the Prosecutor called Witness CBI, who testified on the 1st and the 4th of October 2004 before your Court.  That witness was also a civil party in the course of the Kibuye trial, which trial, as we all know, resulted in the Ruhengeri judgement acquitting the two priests who were charged. 

Father Seromba was also charged, but in absentia.  That witness says he met Father Seromba first time in 1990 in Nyange while Father Seromba was ordained as a priest in July 1993.  He further testifies that since Father Straton left Nyange parish, he did not step his foot in that parish.  And he says that Straton -- Father Straton's departure occurred in 1992.  This witness is also the only one to say that Father Seromba had a weapon at the presbytery and that he saw Father Seromba shoot at people, which is disputed by a Prosecution witness, in particular, Prosecution Witness YAU.  

Now, this witness also admits that Rwasamanzi -- spelt R-W-A-S-A-M-A-N-Z-I -- who was Tutsi, was indeed employed by Father Seromba at the parish.  In other words, therefore, that person, Rwasamanzi, was never dismissed.  The witness further claims that he saw Rwasamanzi die, and according to him, Rwasamanzi was killed by Father Seromba.  

We did tender into evidence Exhibit D. 11, which shows that in the course of the trial at Kibuye this witness similarly testified that it was Father Kayiranga who killed Rwasamanzi.  In like manner, in reference to someone by the name Venuste Ryanyundo, this witness did make mention of the name of the person who killed Ryanyundo.  He claimed that it was Father Seromba who shot at or who killed Ryanyundo.  

Now, in the case of meetings, the witness ultimately acknowledged the fact that he never attended a meeting, but he used to see Father Seromba in the company of people he claims to have been the perpetrators of the crimes that occurred in Nyange.  And before your Court this witness did acknowledge in the course of his testimony.  And in that respect, you are referred to the transcripts of the 4th of October 2004, and he said he was a member of the RPF.  That points to the reliability of any such testimony. 

There was Witness CBS.  He was a Prosecution witness who testified on the 5th and 6th of October 2004.  Now, that witness, same as Witness YAU, was, at the very least, honest enough to contradict the testimony of CBI, and he said Father Seromba did not carry any weapon.  And in that connection, his testimony was as follows.  

It is drawn from his testimony, that of the 6th of October 2004, and Witness CBS says as follows:  "So, when you talk of Father Seromba bearing a weapon or carrying a weapon, I never said that he carried a weapon at the time.  Even if such statements were recorded, that does not represent what I told them." 

That witness, after having accused Nishyirimbere, N-I-S-H-Y-I-R-I-M-B-E-R-E, I shall repeat, N-I-S-H-Y-I-R-I-M-B-E-R-E, having accused that person of having participated in the events at Nyange finally changed his version of the facts.  And we should like to draw your attention in that regard to the witness's testimony of the 6th of October 2004, 6th October 2004, page 2.  So the contradiction is obvious, and the credibility thereby, Madam President, Your Honours, cannot be given to that witness's testimony.  

Witness CBT testified on 6 and 7 October 2004 and maintained that it was the gendarme who had killed Anicet Gatera, a Tutsi, and not Father Athanase Seromba, even if he also says that he saw no priest that was armed at the parish, but there is, nonetheless, several contradictions and untruths in his testimony which emerges from Defence Exhibit D. 22.  So this witness also cannot be -- the testimony of that witness cannot be taken seriously.  

Now, Witness CDK, that witness testified on the 7th and 11th of October 2004 before the Court.  He is also contradictory -- self-contradictory. 
(Pages 7 to 18 by Sherri Knox)

























1100H 
MR. NEKUIE (continuing): 
He asserts a meeting was held on 15 April 1994 at the (no interpretation) and asserts that it was Kanyarukiga and Kayishema who asked the Accused to destroy the church.  He admits it was the refugees who locked themselves into the church and not Father Seromba who had locked the doors.  He says that he went to the mass at Nyange parish and yet he could not recognise Father Seromba here before you.  The same is true of CBT, who could not identify Father Seromba at the time of his testimony before you.  You therefore weigh the reliability of those two witnesses.  

Now, Witness CBJ, he testified on the 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 October 2004.  He spoke at length, both in examination-in-chief and under cross-examination, and this is what he said about the death of Miriam.  He stated as follows:  "The people that I were able to identify were Kayishema, Fulgence, the IPJ.  Miriam was dragged off by one Muringanyi."  I will spell, M-U-R-I-N-J-A-N-Y-I, M-U-R-I-N-G-A-N-Y-I.  But I don't know his Christian name.  The IPJ, the judicial police inspector Kayishema held Miriam's head and was beating it against the earth in the courtyard."  

Regarding the death of Anicet Gatare, Witness CBJ stated, "I saw Abbé Seromba extend his arms toward the gendarme who was next to the water cistern.  He complained and said, 'Where are these people going who are climbing up the walls,' and all of a sudden I saw the gendarme in front of the corridor near the first level fire, shoot -- fire his gun at Anicet Gatare."  This is what he stated on 15 and 18 October 2004.  According to him, therefore, it was Father Seromba who fired on -- and he said Gatare.  As regards the death of Boniface Gatare, Witness CBJ is the only one to claim it was Father Seromba and Nturiye who killed that person.  The Defence merely wishes to recall that the two priests, Kayiranga and Nturiye, were judged and acquitted, and that what is established before this Court that those witnesses took care not to answer embarrassing questions under cross-examination by playing with counsel and even admitted being close to power in Kigali and a member of the FARG, which is close to the Ibuka association.  And he is therefore a professional accuser who blames Father Seromba for not even showing a scar to establish his innocence.  

Witness CBN, testified on the 15th and 18th of October 2004.  He asserts that after the refugees were disarmed their arms were taken to the statue of the Virgin Mary, whereas other witnesses claim that they were kept in the presbytery.  Those are the contradictions with this witness that we underscored at the time of our discussion of Count 1, saying that these -- this testimony was not credible.


Witness CBN claims that Father Seromba would not say the mass for the refugees, but we have established that the mass could no longer be said under the circumstances that prevailed at the time; that Father Seromba could no long officiate.  The witness also stated that there was no list of Tutsi to be exterminated, and also asserted that Father Seromba never participated in any attack.  So, all that helps us to understand that that witness only came to be of service to the Prosecution and not to report events that he had experienced during the events at Nyange.  

Witness CBK testified on the 19th and 20th of October 2004.  At the time of the events, (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) and he rendered himself indispensable by claiming he was everywhere.  
MS. ARBIA:
(Microphones overlapping)...we cannot accept this.  We have never seen such a thing.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Counsel, I have asked to be alerted each time there was an item identifying a witness, and here I think we must strike from the record what is said about this witness.  That is to say, his age and his occupation, all that must be struck from the record.  

Have you got that?  It's no point my repeating.  You have got that, have you?  
THE ENGLISH INTEPRETER:
The president asks the French court reporters.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please continue, Counsel Nekuie.  You must be careful with regard to these particulars that identify witnesses.  They are protected.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Madam President.  

CBK, who claims to know everything, does not know who -- Witness CBK, who claims to have known everything, does not know who took the decision to disarm the refugees, and his version of the death of Boniface Gatare is different from that of CBJ and CBN.  He admits that it was the gendarme who killed -- and he said Gatare -- and he was the only witness to claim that Father Seromba kept the two children at the presbytery to ingratiate himself with the Inkotanyi, which the Prosecutor calls forging an alibi, whereas we know that Seromba had actually left Rwanda before the arrival of the RPF in the month of June, and he left the doors open to the refugees when he fled.  So as regards to the alleged meeting held at the -- in the bishop's chambers -- should know that it was Father Balthazar Habimana who, after the 4th of April was in the bishop's chambers.  Father Balthazar **********************.  

Hence, the testimony -- one must also be cautious with regard to the testimony of that witness in respect of what I have said.  As to the allegations, according to which Father Seromba had deprived the refugees of food, that witness admits that Sister Mama Jean brought food to the refugees.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That was Sister Mama Jean.  
MR. NEKUIE:
As to the death of Boniface Gatare, this witness's testimony, CBK, differs from that of CBJ in respect of Miriam.  Regarding Miriam, Witness CBK says that she was a friend of Father Seromba who had spent much time at the parish.  But he doesn't say anything about what caused her death, and as to the arm that Father Seromba allegedly held, the witness claimed that after the 9th of April he had a rifle to ensure his security, is an assertion contradicted by the evidence and the testimony of other Prosecution witnesses.  

Witness Materassi Massimo, not a protected witness because his name is used quite openly and systematically by all parties.  That is Materassi Massimo from the Florence préfecture is an immigration officer and testified on the 21st of October 2004.  The Prosecutor called him to demonstrate to the Court things that Father Seromba has never denied:  That he has a resident's permit and a borrowed name, and that he left Rwanda using a Zairian passport.  That was never denied by Father Seromba.  And to the extent that the Italian and Zairian authorities, since it was a Zairian passport, never prosecuted the -- Father Seromba for using false documents, neither did the Prosecution.  So one doesn't understand the use of such allegations on the part of the Prosecutor in this matter, and the Defence wishes to stress that that procedure on Father Seromba's part was also used in times of war by very respectable persons in France at the time of the 2nd World War, by persons such as President Mitterrand and quite a few others.  In the situation of war in which Father Seromba found himself, it was quite normal that in order to escape the war he finds means -- such means to flee.  That is nothing new nor is it a criminal offence.  That is as regards the testimony of Massimo, which are of no interest to this Court, Madam President.  

Now, as to Allessandro Farrugio, he is one of the Prosecution witnesses who testified on 21st October 2004, an Italian journalist with the paper Nazione.  The Defence find it surprising that the Prosecution called this witness because he is a person who claims to have met Father Seromba only briefly and never interviewed Father Seromba, and that Father Seromba's interview was by another journalist by the name of Antico.  But the journalist, under cross-examination, admitted he had never been to Rwanda, never been to Nyange, and knew none of the protagonists in the events that occurred there in April 1994 and he merely drafted an article on Father Seromba on the basis of issue number 2 of African Rights, and we all know what credibility to ascribe to that publication, which I shall return to make a small comment on at the end of my pleadings.  So that witness added that all the sources for his article come from the Internet and he never found the so-called alibi that the Prosecution alleges Father Seromba had when he -- they came that he claimed that he left Nyange on the 6th of April 1993.  He found no trace of that.  
In respect of African Rights, again, the witness realised -- acknowledged under cross-examination as regards the credibility of that organisation, its very poor reputation -- the very poor reputation of African Rights today, and this is what he said in answer to the question put to him.  Question:  "If I was to tell you some people came here a few days ago to tell us that they had declared that what African Rights declared was not what they had written, would you maintain that that organisation is credible?"  And Mr. Farrugia's response was as follows:  "It is certainly possible.  I remember two or three years ago I drafted a quotation from a report of Reporters without Borders saying that African Rights is too often on the side of the Tutsi against the Hutu.  So it's not the first time I heard that."  That is what he stated on the 21st of October 2004, and it's in the transcript.  

And to finish with that witness, this is what he said in respect of his article:  "I did not draft an article saying that Father Seromba was responsible.  I wrote an article saying that African Rights had said that he was responsible and that it should -- we should check what African Rights wrote to know whether it is true or not." 

That witness, therefore, has no sure source for his information, and he acknowledged that, Madam President, Your Honours.  And consequently you will take account of that in your evaluation -- in your assessment of the probative value of his testimony.  

Witness CDL testified on 19 November 2005.  He speaks of a meeting at the end of which the decision was taken to disarm the refugees.  It was allegedly held at the communal office and Seromba was tasked with that task, but did not attend the meeting.  The witness spoke of the existence of a security committee responsible for the security of the commune under the authority of the bourgmestre, who was assisted by the cantonal judge, the judicial police inspector and the communal policeman.  That witness recalled the name of the people that obliged him to go and fetch the bulldozer and does not mention the name of Father Seromba.  

Witness CDL speaks of two bulldozers instead of one and of a truck.  As regards to the recompense, the reward promised to the assailants, the witness alleged it was Ndungutse and Kayishema that made that promise, and again does not mention Father Seromba.  The witness said that when the assailants tried to destroy the church to set fire to it with petrol, Father Seromba was, according to him, in the internal courtyard of the presbytery, and he states that it was the bourgmestre who gave the signal to start the attack by shooting at someone in the bell tower.  

Witness CBL also says that he could not -- or that it was the communal authorities who were leading the attacks.  He also says that when the refugees -- or stones were being thrown at the refugees, Father Seromba was not there with them.  He also makes mention of a meeting that took place on the 13th April 1994 at the communal office in the course of which the decision was made to attack the refugees.  He submits that Father Seromba was there, whereas he himself was not present.  In fact, this witness only makes mention of rumours or hearsay in regard to this meeting, since he didn't -- wasn't able to produce incontrovertible proof.  

Our observations on that witness are rather lengthy, Madam President.  Well, I am going to do so because it seems to me to be useful.  

The witness said that it was Kayishema who decided on the setting up on roadblocks in the commune as from the 7th of April 1994.  It was an urgent measure because, on his return on 9 April 1994, the bourgmestre summoned a meeting on 11 April 1994 in which Father Seromba was present.  But that is contradicted by numerous witnesses, many other witnesses -- which testimony is contradicted by numerous other witnesses.  Now, in his statement to the investigators of the criminal Tribunal, the witness says that in the course of killings Father Seromba was doing nothing; he just stood next to or in front of the presbytery.  That is on the 15th April 1994.  And, therefore, he disputes what was said by Witnesses CBN and CBS.  

This witness, CDL, also said that he was summoned to appear in the course of the trial of Kayiranga, Fathers Kayiranga and Nturiye, in Kibuye.  And he said that he used the guilty plea procedure because he had hoped that there would be a reduction of his sentence by the Rwandan authorities.  He does acknowledge that prior to the events of April 1994, he viewed Father Seromba like a good father, somebody who watched over the population, particularly the population in Kivumu.  Clearly, the appearance of Witness CDL before the Court is warranted, because by testifying against Father Seromba it was his hope that there would be a reward for him from the Rwandan authorities that with regard to a reduction of his sentence or term of imprisonment.  

Witness CBR testified on the 20th and 21st January 2005.  And he says that when they had wanted to launch the very first attack, they were deterred from doing so by the gendarmes.  Whereas, the Prosecutor says without blinking that this was said by Father Seromba.  

CBR also says that it was Ndungutse who had used the word "dirt" in reference to the dead bodies of the Tutsis at the church.  Again those were allegations attributed or words put in the mouth of Father Seromba.  This witness also says that he did not know the person who issued the order that the church be destroyed, he only saw the machines at work when he was at the church at about 10 o'clock.  Now, he says, regarding the priests who were at the presbytery, he said he saw two priests arrive, namely, Kayiranga and Nturiye on 15 April 1994, and after that he didn't see them again.  Now, regarding Father Seromba, he said he did see him in the morning of the 16th April 1994, he was with the authorities who were coming out of the courtyard of the presbytery and he was standing in front of the door where he usually stood.  He didn't see him do anything, he did not hear anything said about him.  And, so, the testimony of this witness clash with the allegations made by the Prosecutor, whereas this was a Prosecution witness --  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Counsel Nekuie, the court reporters are telling us they are unable to follow you.  So, if you can slow down a bit, slow down your pace.  And we would like to know how much time you still need.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam President, I am going to slow down.  I think soon I will be finished with the witnesses.  I am bound to proceed in this manner because these are matters we would have wanted to submit to you in writing, and that's why I am striving to read them out.  I am going to do so slowly.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, yesterday we did tell you that you had to organise yourself so that you conclude the Defence case in two and a half hours, because you had already been given two and a half hours yesterday.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam President, I will soon be finished, rest assured, since we are also asking the Prosecutor not to interfere with the time allotted me.  

Witness -- I was talking about CDL sorry, or CBR, sorry.  Now, he says that he did not see Father Seromba shoot at anyone.  He merely deplored the fact that Father Seromba did nothing to prevent the killings.  He said Father Seromba should have left the presbytery.  In any case, this is a witness who in actual fact -- well, whose testimony cannot be used by the Prosecutor in support of his allegations.  

Witness CNJ -- and that's the last speaker -- sorry, that's the last witness for the Prosecution whom I will be talking about -- now, he testified before the Court on the 24th and 25th of January 2005, and he completely contradicted what was said by Witness CBR and Witness CNJ, who was part of the assailants, a member of the assailants, and who said that at the time they were pursuing the Tutsis in order to kill them they had wanted to get into the presbytery, Father Seromba prevented them from doing so and asked them to remove all the dead bodies that were in front of secretariat.  

Now, regarding the death of Anicet Gatare, Witness CNG says that according to what he heard or what he was told, the assailants took Gatare from the presbytery and pulled him out through the secretariat.  He says that at the parish there is only one banana plantation, and he never said that Father Seromba prevented the refugees from having access to that or issued any instructions to the gendarmes.  He claimed to know Father Seromba since 1992, whereas in 1992 Father Seromba had not even been ordained a priest.  This witness also says that Father Seromba and Kayiranga were asked to ensure that the refugees were fed.  Yet we noted in the testimony of other Prosecution witnesses that it is established that Mama Jean did provide food to the refugees on behalf of the clergy.  So this is totally contradictory testimony, particularly as it is at variance with what he had to say in the course of his guilty plea.  And, in that regard, Defence had tendered Exhibit D. 40 and D. 42 which point out those inconsistencies.  

In the final analysis, Madam President, Your Honours, on the Prosecution witnesses, there is need to point out that none of the witnesses called by the Prosecutor provide facts or testified to facts that they observed by themselves.  They didn't provide any evidence of acts carried out by Father Seromba in their presence.  Most of the witnesses -- most of the evidence is hearsay, and when they claim they saw Father Seromba carry out certain acts, even there it's hearsay.  So, Madam President, Your Honours, these are -- this is evidence fraught with complacency, as far as Defence is concerned.  

As for witnesses for the Defence -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will take a ten-minute break now.  So, Counsel, ten minutes, thank you.  
(Court recessed from 1130H to 1145H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is in session.  Counsel Nekuie, please.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Obliged, Madam President.  I will make a very quick comment with respect to testimonies by Defence witnesses.  I won't go into the details so as to enable you to finally round up this matter.  

Defence called 24 witnesses, namely, BZ3, BZ14, BZ4, BZ5, BZ1, BZ2, YA1, BZ8, CF14, FE36, FE35, BO1, BR1, NA1, FE27, FE6, Nkinamubanzi Anastase, FE31, FE34, FE23, FE56, FE13, FE55 and PA1.  The transcripts reflect the purport of their testimony, Madam President, Your Honours.  

The only comment that Defence would like to make is that the first category of witnesses all came from Congo and their pseudonyms were BZ, essentially.  They did testify before you here, Madam President, that being present in Nyange they never saw Father Seromba involved in any killing at all.  On the contrary, since they knew Father Seromba, they were able to testify to the fact that Father Seromba did what he could at the time of the events in order to fulfil his duties as a pastor dealing with those who were affected.  

The main testimony on which the Defence would like to draw your attention is that of Nkinamubanzi, Anastase.  Nkinamubanzi, Anastase, who was the driver of the bulldozer, Madam President, and who told you in unequivocal terms, and I had the opportunity to say so.  He said he didn't receive any orders, he did not receive any reward from Father Seromba so as to carry out the demolition of the church.  

Another testimony or evidence that needs to be highlighted for your Court is that of BZ2, who was none other than the wife of Prosecution Witness CDL, who completely disputed the testimony of her husband regarding the events in Nyange and the involvement, possible involvement of Father Seromba.  Further, Madam President, it needs to be said that 12 of those witnesses were initially Prosecution witnesses.  It was on the basis of the so-called statements made by those witnesses that the Prosecutor was able to secure the confirmation of the indictment of Father Seromba by Judge Williams.  

It is all the same good for me to make mention or refer to the pseudonyms of those witnesses, that's CF14, FE36, FE35, FE2, FE6 Nkinamubanzi himself, FE31, FE34, CF23, FE56, FE13 and FE55.  Those are the people on the basis of whose declarations or statements the Prosecutor relied in order to secure the confirmation of the indictment by Judge Williams.  Rather strangely, on the way, the Prosecutor relinquished those testimonies because they did not stand by the allegations attributed to them by the Prosecutor, and the Prosecutor then managed to convince them to appear here to testify against Father Seromba.  He left them to go and secure some chance witnesses to try to convince you.  

Some other point that needs to be highlighted is that, apart from the fact that the Defence was able to secure their appearance before you, Witness CF14, FE13 and FE6, those four witnesses denied in a formal -- or denied once and for all the allegations made by African Rights in the Prosecution note in 2, and that is the real cornerstone of the charges that you have to consider.  In fact, the Prosecutor did not vary those allegations against Father Seromba, which allegations, essentially, base on the testimony of those witnesses.  Madam President, Your Honours, these witnesses came and completely rebutted whatever was alleged that they had said.  What kind of significance would you therefore attribute to the allegations of the Prosecutor, when the Prosecutor, in addition, allows himself to produce that bulletin number 2 under P. 5E and F in support of allegations that he had made against Father Seromba.  That is the question in the quiet of your chambers that you would be required to answer. 

It will be necessary, in answering that question or addressing that question, to take into account the observations of the Defence, according to which it was able to be proven that African Rights, together with the articles published by that organisation or African Rights are mere tools in the hands of the current regime in Kigali.  It is public knowledge that Rakiya Omar, who happens to be the director of African Rights, had for more than a decade been working hand in hand with RPF officers, and in actual fact his NGO, which goes by the name African Rights, is nothing else than the London relay of the intelligence outfits of the current regime.  That is found in a book by Pierre Péan, and the title is Noires fureurs, Blancs menteurs.  Those are the facts that you need to take into account in the assessment of the evidence before you.  

And beyond the incidents that might have occurred in the course of this trial, the Defence would want that you try Father Seromba on the basis of his status, his situation in 1994.  It was not one that was unique, and not confined to the Nyange parish.  But it does happen, Madam President, that at the same time some other priest by the name Gabriel Maindron was completely ill at ease in a parish under his command.  He was able (sic) to put an end to the killing that occurred there, inter alia, the Gitwa massacres, which came under his parish.  And in that circumstance, he did not have the means; it was not possible for him to prevent the bourgmestre in his own area of jurisdiction, prevent him from perpetrating all those criminal acts that occurred under his eyes.  Father Maindron, quite clearly, talks of that tragedy that he had to face with the people under his custody during the events in 1994, both -- events which occurred both in his parish and in the communes wherein that parish was located.  Father Maindron was not brought to trial by the Prosecutor, because it is obvious that Father Maindron was in no manner responsible for what happened.  

Why this separate treatment, treatment that was meted out to Father Seromba, and the manner in which the other priests were treated?  Or was it because the rumours in Rwanda - or, the regime in Rwanda required that Father Seromba had to collapse or he was a symbol of the demonisation of the church in Rwanda?  If the Prosecutor can rely on rumours to bring charges against whomsoever he wishes to accuse, you must guard against following what may lead you in the wrong direction.  We are talking about freedom.  We are talking about serious accusations being made against someone whose status does not allow him to suffer from any suspicion in that regard.  And, therefore, Vincent de Moro-Giafferi told the judges, "Please guard against allowing rumours or what I could call (French spoken) public opinion, because that public opinion or public rumour drags the judge by his or her robe."  And that is what brought about the black September for France.  It is that public opinion that brought about the crucifixion of Christ in Golgotha.  

Your hand as Judges should not serve the purpose of public opinion and rumours and therefore bring about Father Seromba being thrown into the depths of injustice.  That's my submission.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Nekuie.  

Counsel Monthé, your final submissions. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, thank you.  Madam President, Your Honours, I will be brief now that we are rounding up the closing statements for Father Seromba.  

Madam President, I would like to have you allow the registry to hand to the interpreters -- the interpreters, the document that I will be using.  Thank you.  

Madam President, here we are now at the end of this protracted trial during which Defence will take up a responsibility incumbent on it, namely, to speak to address this Court last.  

The Bible does say that you shall give birth in pain.  What pain?  What should we conclude from this trial?  The first lesson that we of the Defence draw from this trial is a lesson of a legal nature.  The Prosecutor attempted to transform these offences, namely, genocide, complicity in genocide, conspiracy with a view to committing genocide, crimes against humanity, extermination, to transform them into a huge bag of incidents or offences.  He used the Rules of Procedure and Evidence and used an inelastic reading of those documents or those instruments, and eventually undermining the principle of presumption of innocence.  Such an ill-intended and dishonest practice led to Father Seromba being caused to be considered as a criminal by the Prosecutor, even if there is no mens rea, no intent, or no act to commit any such crime.  

Madam President, Your Honours, this case is in legal terms empty, void.  You know, this trial, as far as Father Seromba and the Defence are concerned, is one of the soul, the body, one of faith in men, faith in God.  As far as I am concerned, I am not engaged in witch-hunting or the search for a scapegoat for the purpose of obtaining by any means and above all in violation of all the rules of law, the sentencing or conviction of an innocent person, namely,  of Father Seromba.  

There is something peculiar about criminal law.  One can assert whatever one wants to assert, but then you have to produce the evidence.  And at no point, right from the beginning of this trial, was evidence adduced beyond any reasonable doubt as required by case law according to which Father Seromba would be deemed guilty of the allegations made against him.  Your procedure follows this tortuous path, same as a sandstorm in the desert.  The purpose of those who instituted this trial was not only to ensure that truth emerges, because they were not interested in ascertaining the truth but for someone of the Roman Catholic church to be convicted so as to justify or serve as a basis of extermination   

Now, the indictment of Father Seromba mainly takes up the false accusations, some that have been orchestrated by certain experts well known for their rumour mongering circulated about persons, including about someone considered as being disturbing.  To justify that point, please do refer to the transcript of Witness CPJ who said he supported the RPF and that he appeared here at the request of that party, the RPF.  That's a witness who can be characterised as a professional accuser.  Together with people like Rakiya Omaar -- alluded to by my learned friend brother Maître Nekuie -- the founder of the African Rights organisation, that individual who has orchestrated that syndicate of rumour mongers alluded to by CPJ.  

When in the indictment you go over the actions and initiatives of Father Seromba at that fateful time of April 1994, in vain does one seek which act can lawfully constitute the element of a crime, let alone genocide.  Better than anyone, the Court knows that in criminal law a crime or an offence cannot be constituted by any act.  Even if a person is accused of it, it must be defined by law, and the person accused must have the mens rea, the deliberate intention to offend, which is what we call in criminal law, criminal intent, much of the constituent elements of the crime or offence, without which no human act can be considered to be a crime or an offence.  So I put the question to you:  Where was that criminal intent in Father Seromba's conduct at the time?  Did you at any time in the course of this trial see it, that criminal intent?  And what did it consist of, if you saw it?  What characterised it, if it existed?  These are questions that remain unanswered till today.  

Madam President, the Defence admits that the imperialists (phonetic) need to punish the genocide and crimes against humanity because of their extreme gravity, just as the need to try -- the undeniable need to try and repair -- to cure the great suffering in the minds and hearts of Rwandans leaves intact to the sacred principle of stricter definition of crimes under criminal law -- or offences under criminal law.  

Madam President, Father Seromba, Athanase Seromba, is the illustration of what Koester was saying when he wrote the following:  "When you don't know what to blame someone for of nothing -- when you present him in front of your adversary, you merely blame him for his ideas, but for the public, there must be a trial and a legal justification." 

For the record, Koester is spelt K-O-E-S-T-E-R,  K-O-E-S-T-E-R.  

That is the case in point, Madam President.  Moreover, I told you yesterday that the Prosecutor made no mistake because they blamed the Defence for only bringing Hutu witnesses who see the offence -- what Seromba is accused of is being a priest and being Hutu.  Those are the two minimum and necessary conditions for him to be accused here before you.  And that is the justification of the regime in Kigali, and the Office of the Prosecutor.  That's what has kept us here all these years. 

Madam President, do not let yourself be led astray.  What shocks me in the nights I spent studying the record is the inconsistency on the part of the Prosecution.  Madam President, when we know how -- the extent of the Prosecution's means deployed in Seromba's trial, the administrative authorities of Kivumu -- Kivumu administrative authorities at no time did they bring those administrative authorities here.  Mention was made of Ndahimana, Kayishema, Ndungutse.  We have seen none of those protagonists, of those actors.  Even more serious, you and we on the Defence benches know that the Prosecution has Gaspard Kanyarukiga here in Arusha, often mentioned.  But he was never summoned to tell us whether Gaspard Kanyarukiga -- Kanyarukiga is spelt K-A-N-Y-A-R-U-K-I-G-A.  He is here in Arusha.  They have him, and why was he never called to say whether Father Seromba was with him?  The (unintelligible) of this Trial, Kanyarukiga, Gaspard, is here in Arusha, why was he never called here to accuse Father Seromba?  Why on the basis of these conjurer's tricks convict Father Seromba?  

I look at you, madam, you have often -- you have worked for a long time in the judiciary.  You have sat even in the supreme court in Dakar.  When you go and retire in St. Louis, Dakar, or Port Diourbel, will you be able to look your grandchildren in the eye and tell them that you have convicted an innocent man?  Madam, how do you tell the -- your grandchildren that in Kibuye, in Ruhengeri, all those (unintelligible) Kayiranga was acquitted by the Tutsi judges, but, here, you convicted Seromba -- was convicted, whereas he -- if he had been tried there, he would have been acquitted.  Whereas if he is convicted here, how are you going to tell your children and your grandchildren that you convicted Seromba?

I apologise to the interpreters.  

So how will you explain that?  The witnesses one by one came here to tell us how he has gone through the spirit of imprisonment and this trial.  

Madam President, I am pleading my case under difficult circumstances, but I must plead it.  That is my mission before this Court. 
(Pages 19 to 30 by Judith Baverstock)















1215H
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, in the course of this trial the Prosecutor -- to close to -- the Defence documents ICTR 2001, 66I, dated 31 of August 2004.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could we have that reference again, please?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
This is a letter dated 27th of November 2003 from Ruhengeri -- to the Prosecutor at the Kigali court, which is a transmission of the copy of the file RMP50919/S4/GM signed by Gisengi, spelled G-I-S-E-N-G-I, G-I-S-E-N-G-I, Mugeyo, M-U-G-E-Y-O, M-U-G-E-Y-O, entitled "Report on Matter RMP50919/S4/GM/KBY/97, RP014/01/98, RPA34/RT/RUH, RMPA3/263/MJMV.  The Prosecutor versus Edouard Nturiye and Emmanuel Jean François Kayiranga, co-accused. " 

Madam President, in paragraph 4, page 4 of that document, para B, it states, "Concerning fathers Nturiye and Kayiranga, concerning the events at Nyange.  The appeals chamber notes that the witness's questions as to the events in Nyange agree that the two fathers arrived in Nyange two hours before an attack there and considered that it is impossible that in that time frame the accused could have planned and organised an attack on such a scale coming from Kibuye, Rtsirambia and -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Somewhere else.
MR. MONTHÉ:
-- notes that the court -- the trial chamber -- the court of first instance erred on the facts including that Kayiranga and Nturiye attended a meeting where it was decided to destroy the church where Nkinamubanzi who pleaded according to the confession and plea of guilty procedure, which was accepted by the court, that -- and consequently benefited from a reduction in sentence, explained in the course of three interviews that it was he who had destroyed the church on the orders of Kayishema and four soldiers who had just consulted Father Seromba and, therefore, Father Kayiranga and Nturiye were not involved and the trial chamber did not take account of the written statements of six survivors that would have made it possible to render a fair judgement, because of the witness's question they were civil parties to the case and noted that the fathers in question had no power to end the massacres when the civilian and military authorities failed, stating that they were overcome by events, consequently it wasn't those priests who could have saved the situation."

So there, that is the record before you, Your Honours.  You must bear in mind, my Ladies, that criminal law does not forbid heroism.  Succour can be brought if there is no risk, for he who gives succour, if he doesn't -- if he doesn't put his own situation in danger or make that of the person he's saving worse.  

Father Seromba pleads his innocence and maintains that he has always been in good faith and the symbolic value of his trial lies therein, a trial that began three weeks after Pentecost, which for the Catholics is when Holy Spirit showed himself to the Apostles.  And I hope that the Holy Spirit is present and supervises our work here.  Once more, Father Seromba stresses his innocence and your Trial Chamber must render him justice in spite of all he has suffered since the beginning of this trial.  

The danger that this Court must avoid at all costs in the trial is to connect the events of April 1994 in the light of what we know today.  In order to appreciate Father Seromba's conduct in April 1994 we must see the situation as it was then and his state of mind at the time, in view of what information people at that time possessed.  Our reading is influenced by what we know today, and otherwise, it would lead you to every act, every word, leads you to interpret every act, every word, as being part of the genocide in the eye -- as it is in the eyes of the Prosecutor.  We, as the officers of the Court owe it to the world, owe it to Africa because we are Africans and judging here other Africans who are concerned first and foremost here.  So when you render your judgement, your decision, you must show the world that Africans go about this very seriously.  

Madam President, there is a man, an African, one of the few who we negroes are proud of, negroes in the term of Aimé Césaire, and that man is Kofi Annan.  And this is what he said on the 22nd of January 2005 on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz that sinister Nazi concentration camp, and this is what Kofi Annan said, that great African, along with Mandela and others:  "We have not succeeded in preventing other genocide such as that in Rwanda."  And I would add on my part that there was that of the Kurds by the Turks; that of the Armenians by the Turks; that of Cambodians by the Pol Pot regime, and that of Darfur today, and nothing is being done.  Now, what could Father Seromba alone been able to do, a poor little country priest in Nyange?  George Orwell, Madam President, for the record, O-R-W-E-L-L.  I'll repeat that, O-R-W-E-L-L, in his Reflections on Gandhi said as follows, "Saints are always considered guilty unless their innocence is proven."

Niccolò Machiavelli, who is also a very interesting person to read, says the following, and this deserves to be thought over, which I ask you to share this with me.  And I bring this to the attention of the Prosecution and Madam Prosecutor Niccolò Machiavelli said, "Sometimes words are used to disguise facts, but it should be done in such a way for no one to realise it because if it were -- and if it should happen that that was -- people were made aware that you must have an excuse at hand."  

At this point I should like to tell you, Madam President, from the depths of my heart and depths of my conviction, Father Seromba is innocent.  Father Seromba is a man of peace.  Father Seromba did everything he could.  

And I would now like to cite a great statesman of Rwanda who answered a journalist who asked him what he could have done with his army to stop the genocide with his mighty army, equipped as it was, and what that great soldier said was, "But I am certain that everybody was caught unawares and that is why when it happened on the 6th, we did all we could from the 7th, in the evening.  That is when we started to deploy our soldiers to try and save the situation and, of course, what -- the only thing left to do was to act as well we could, knowing that we could not realise miracles; we could not achieve miracles, could not perform miracles.  They had -- once the international community had at their disposal the necessary means to stop it and never did so."  He went on to say, "The balance of forces was two and a half to one but even if we had been an equal number or greater numbers we couldn't have stopped the massacres that the militiamen were committing in the villages, the militiamen who spread throughout the country.  Even if we were a hundred thousand strong we couldn't have stopped it.  As far as I know we accomplished what we could under the circumstances.  In fact, we only did what our forces could achieve, and I don't see anything we could have done that we didn't do."

I was quoting General Paul Kagame in his book, Towards a New Rwanda, Interview with Paul Kagame by -- published in Karthala 1995.  

Madam President, Your Honours, I have finished with this phase of the trial.  I am a man of faith.  As his Holiness, John Paul II said, thinking of the master, "Do not fear."  Do not fear, Madam President to acquit Mr. Seromba.  Madam President, do not fear.  We know from antiquity that it is to create an ideal state who will guard the guardians themselves and who will guard the judges?  You know that when posterity judges, it will judge first of all the judges.  Madam President, Your Honour, acquit Father Seromba and we will be able to say yes, there are true judges in Rwanda.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Monthé.  

Does the Prosecution wish to respond?  
MS. ARBIA:
Not really a response, per se.  That closing statement does not in any manner affect what has been stated by the Prosecutor since the 26th of May of this year, that is, with respect to the guilt of the Accused and with respect to the penalties sought by the Prosecutor.  Be that as it may, I have observations to make for the Court.  

The Prosecutor has performed what she has to do seeking -- apart from whatever the public thinks, this is the Prosecutor, an international body completely independent, irrespective of whatever judgement is rendered by the courts in Rwanda.  The Prosecutor has submitted supporting material which would be assessed by international judges in arriving at a judgement.  It is not a matter of trickery or lies, which accusation has been made by Defence against the Prosecution.  The Defence has said often that this is a special accused person.  Now, beyond the conclusions of the Prosecutor and the technical aspects of this trial, I might be made to agree with the Defence.  Indeed, this is a special accused person because this is someone who failed in carrying out what was described by the Defence as his pastoral duties.  But not only that, he committed crimes for which he stands charged by the Prosecution, but he also failed in his pastoral duties.  I do not intend to go back to the indictment and the evidence, which puts together both Seromba and the authorities who have been described as extremists and, above all, who have been described as the leaders of the killing, the brains behind the killings.  The evidence is there.  He was with those people.  He was not, according to the evidence of the Defence or according to the outcome of it -- he might have prayed with them.  He might even have brought succour to them and did things that a priest with a pastoral mission has to do.  He didn't do all of that.  I shall leave that comment.  

Let me note that this Accused should not be entitled to any mitigating factor or circumstance.  The Defence accused the Prosecutor of not dwelling on the character of the Accused.  Well, that's contrary to what the international Prosecutor did.  The international Prosecutor not only sought to understand the character or personality of this Accused, she even attempted to ascertain to find out what the Accused did after the events.  He escaped; he changed his name; he told lies in the country -- in his asylum country; he misled them.  He even misled the faithful, over whom he officiated, with a false name.  Who will believe Seromba?  Who will trust him as a priest and as a survivor of the tragic events in Rwanda in 1994?  

Madam President, Your Honours, this Accused person should not benefit from any clemency.  The Prosecutor has always viewed her responsibility or carried out her responsibility without considering the fact that the Accused belongs to the Roman Catholic Church.  The Catholic Church was never mentioned.  No Prosecution witness came here to talk about the role of the Catholic Church in the course of the events in 1994 in Rwanda.  The international Prosecutor did not seek the conviction of the Catholic Church.  So let that be clear.  

Madam President, Your Honours, it is the view of the Prosecutor the conclusions that appear in the final brief stand and we request that the guilt of this Accused, particularly in the counts that are in contention, will be alternative charging of genocide and complicity in genocide, be upheld and that the penalties sought be enforced.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank the Prosecutor.  We now turn to the Defence.  You want to make any rejoinder?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Absolutely.  I can't let her get away with that.  At any rate, that's the only privilege we have in our black robes.  

Madam Prosecutor, I regret that you are lying.  No Prosecutor is independent, even if that Prosecutor is an independent one.  You have a boss that issues orders.  There was no independent Prosecutor.  I'm sorry, you do not know your job.  Let me tell you that you are not independent.  Let me say this to you, since you are Italian (no interpretation), to err is human.  You have come and said, "Who would trust Seromba?"  That is a question.  Now who trusts Monseigneur Misago, who has been acquitted?  Who trusts Jean François Kayiranga?  And Nturiye? Father Guetonist (phonetic)?  Who trusts them?  You should have been silent.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We have, I believe, come to the end of this hearing and since we have asked the Accused if he wanted to say something, well, we've heard nothing from him.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Well, the witness -- the Accused wants to say something.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Then you may wish to come to the -- or take the stand in front of the Bench and say whatever you want to say.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can the witness be helped to turn on his microphone, Rose Marie?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could the curtains be opened?  They have been closed as though this was a protected witness, but the Accused is to address the Trial Chamber.  

Now the public can also see the defendant.
THE ACCUSED SEROMBA:
Madam President, Your Honours, the man you are called upon to try here today is named 
Athanase Seromba, a priest of the Roman Catholic Church since the 18th of July 1993, date on which I was ordained.  I was all called to exercise my pastoral duties is in Nyange parish in September 1993 where I entirely devoted myself to my parishioners according to the vows I had taken before God.  

Today I'm accused here, or, unfairly accused of having planned, ordered, and having killed those whom I loved and who I assisted and whom I should like to be able to assist in the course of the tragic and sad events in Rwanda, more particularly in my parish, Nyange.  I should have liked to be able to tell you what happened in Nyange, because, in truth, the Prosecution here speaks of things they don't know, or you here before me who cannot know what happened in Nyange.  I am the one who should have had sufficient time to tell you everything that happened.  

As of respect of ******************************************* they are protected.  They are protected by God, but I was not about to do so and I regret it, and I suffer therefrom.  I suffer so much from the events themselves that not to have been able to tell the whole world the truth about what really happened in Nyange.  It is really, Madam President, unfair that you should judge someone, try someone for such serious acts without having heard them.  You are the first.  Perhaps, it is your bad luck to try a priest, but for this Tribunal and, unfortunately, to try him without having heard.  

Some of my colleagues who lived through those difficult, painful times in Nyange, because they were present there at the time, came here and tried to explain to you the feeling of impotence that we had at the time, a feeling of helplessness, how much we did to try and save those people.  But, unfortunately, what happened, happened.  

You heard what the witnesses said who came before me, Madam President.  You have also said on several occasions, "We are professional Judges."  No one doubts what you are.  You are called upon to demonstrate who you are and to show that, sincerely, you are professional judges.  As to me, I keep -- I harbour in my heart in respect of this trial a feeling of injustice because I really do not think, at the end of this trial, that I have had -- been able to enjoy my rights or had a fair trial.  And I refer, in that respect thereof, of the various incidents that occurred throughout the trial and especially your decision to leave out Witness PS2 and my testimony.  

Madam President, Your Honours, I am a priest and will be a priest until whenever.  That is the law.  I am a priest.  I believe in the Lord.  I believe in the Holy Spirit, as the former president of the Bar, Monthé has said and I invoke the Holy Spirit for him to guide you in your decision for the innocent man that I am be released and I thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We thank the Accused, Athanase Seromba.  Chamber recalls that our proceedings are recorded to enable the Judge who is absent this morning to get acquainted with them and the record is prepared for that purpose.  

After having heard the closing statements of the Prosecutor, there are submissions of those statements and the Defence, in its own closing statements, together with the Accused, Athanase Seromba, now declares, in accordance with Rule 87 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence that the current proceedings are at end in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Athanase Seromba.  

The three-person Bench will deliberate in camera and judgement will be delivered in open session on a date that will be communicated to the parties and to counsel.  

The Chamber would like to thank all the parties, the legal assistants, the registry, the interpreters, the court reporters, the technicians, all those who have contributed to the conduct of this trial and exhibited lots of patience.  Now, this hearing stands adjourned.
