MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber is now in session.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  

Mr. Registrar, could you kindly announce the matter before us. 
MR. FRY:
Thank you, Your Honour.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Vaz, presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, the 31st of October 2005, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor vs. Seromba, case number ICTR-2001-66-T.  

Thank you, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Registry.  We should now kindly ask the parties to introduce themselves, beginning with the Office of the Prosecutor.  
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, Your Honours, good afternoon.  I am senior trial attorney Silvana Arbia, accompanied with Jonathan Moses, senior trial attorney; Althea Alexis, trial attorney; and Tolulope Olowoye, case manager.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor.  We should now pass the floor to the Defence, Mr. Monthé.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, Madam President.  Good afternoon.  Madam President, Your Honours, I have the honour to lead the Defence team this afternoon.  I also have the honour to say that our co-counsel has arrived.  I am Patrice Monthé from the Cameroon bar.  We're with Ngo Bihegue and Ngo Bihegue, Sarah, counsel  (unintelligible) and our legal assistant.  Thank you to the Chamber.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Monthé.  We shall begin this afternoon with the Defence's opening statement.  Is there any objection from the parties?  No?  As such, we hand the floor to Mr. Monthé for that opening statement.  

You have the floor, Mr. Monthé.
MR. MONTHÉ:  
Thank you, Madam President.  

Madam President, Your Honours, the Defence of Father Seromba, pursuant to the provisions of Rule 84 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, this afternoon, intends to make opening statements in the matter before you.  That is why we are providing you with some august -- with some information to the august Bench.  

I would like to remind you that the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda brought before you Father Athanase Seromba for various counts, the first of which is genocide; the second is complicity in genocide; and the third is conspiracy to commit genocide; and finally, the fourth count, crime against humanity, namely, extermination.  

Let me remind you that, in so doing, the Prosecutor was acting on the basis of Article 17 of the Statute of the Tribunal. 

Your Honours, it is under these circumstances that, on the 8th of June 2001, Ms. Carla Del Ponte, Prosecutor of this Tribunal, signed an indictment against Father Athanase Seromba, and it was filed on the 6th of February 2002 and confirmed the same year by Honourable Williams and served on Father Seromba on the 6th of February 2002, and we shall come back to this -- his voluntary surrender. 

During his initial appearance before Trial Chamber I of your Tribunal, Father Athanase Seromba pleaded not guilty of all counts; namely, genocide, complicity in genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide, and a crime against humanity, extermination, as they appear in the indictment which -- with which you have been seized in rem et in personam, according to legal and juridical principles. 

Madam President, relevance, a little over a year ago, on the 20th of September 2004, I heard the Prosecutor during her opening statements and I believed I heard the trumpets of Jericho -- Jericho, which wanted to crash down the walls.  "I heard the trumpets but the walls did not fall."  It is now my turn to intervene in the interests of Father Seromba and I believe my essential duty before you is to remain strictly faithful to my mission. 

I need to defend but I need only to defend.  I need to defend and I am not here in order to accuse, and, like you, Your Honours of the Tribunal, I must remain deaf to the rumours and the indignation of the city, because they have to fall before the courts of justice.  Because at the door of this Court, where passions are going to die out and stop, we only know a triple-pronged passion:  the passion for the truth, the passion for justice, and the passion for law. 

Madam President, Your Honours, I must confess that the difficulties experienced by Athanase Seromba arise from two speeches made by Mr. Pasteur Bizimungu, who was then the Hutu president of a Tutsi regime in Rwanda, the first spoken in Cyangugu in September 1994, and the second in Kibilira the following year during the anniversary of the tragic events which faced that country. 

This man, without any proof, and I repeat, without any proof, or even the beginnings of evidence, is going to place Athanase Seromba in public condemnation, proclaiming high and loud that the latter, and I quote, had destroyed his church, Nyange church.  In spite of the ancient and sacred principle of right, the presumption of innocence which constitutes the pedestal of penal or criminal law, and this is our legal custom.  In fact, we are referring to the international covenant on civil and political rights at Article 14, the European convention of human rights, Article 6, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and, of course, the Statutes of your Tribunal, Article 20.  This enumeration is not exhaustive, Your Honours. 

So he appeared that, even before any investigation, the least proceedings, it would seem that Father Athanase Seromba was already a victim of a judicial crime orchestrated by the bloody and despot regime of Kigali which has sworn to its loss and the Tribunal had never heard publicly and, in all fairness, the cause for which that indictment was made. 

The head of state of a democratic nation does not render judgements because of a constitutional principle which is simple and intangible; in other words, the separation of powers, the powers being the executive power and the judicial powers. 

This kind of public declarations from the first person in the state constitute what we would call fatwa; these death sentences that extremist Muslims still practice today.  But, Madam President, Your Honours, justice in a policed society is the issue which has to be instituted legally, and we need to remove from these politics.  You see, therefore, that the head of state can be a demagogue, but Mr. Bizimungu was not, bearing in mind the words of Ernest Hemingway when he said, or wrote, "Never ask for whom the bell tolls, for it tolls for you."

Today he is at the central prison in Kigali on fallacious -- false pretexts, and may God forgive him. 

Madam President, Your Honours, these are specious and fallacious, and I would even say wrong accusations against Father Athanase Seromba which were amplified throughout the world by an organisation which was apparently defending human rights and its name was "African Rights", and it never provided any information and it depended on pseudo testimonies which have been contested. 

In so doing, once again, Mr. Bizimungu had forgotten these words, and I quote:  "Man who is denounced in public, irrespective of the presumption of innocence, man who is beaten down, the private man is -- the man who is deprived of his fairness, of fair trial," this is a quotation from Aime Cesaire, "but the suffering of one man is necessary for us to condemn oppression.  Let us be the voice of the voiceless.  Let us be the voice of the voiceless."

Madam President, Your Honours, this afternoon I am the voice of the man without a voice.  

Before fighting against the Prosecutor, Father Seromba must, first of all, fight against the lies that have been told about him and Beaumarchais said the following about calomnie.  "Calomnie, sir," and I quote:  

"You do not know what you are despising.  I saw the most honest of men almost brought down by it.  You believe that there is no horror, no absurdity.  We need to look at this carefully.  First of all, from a light sound, just like the sparrow before the storm, we are being imprisoned, and gently, gently, the ear is pricked.  He is crawling and works from mouth to mouth like the devil.  And then suddenly you see lies coming up, whistling through the wind, and growing in one's eye.  It is -- it becomes a general shout, a public crescendo, a universal chorus of hatred."  

This is what Beaumarchais said in Le Barbier de Seville.

Madam President, Your Honours, the Defence must today demonstrate, must bring down the edifice of lies and calomnies which have been brought against this man in the public square.  The Defence no longer can keep quiet about the injustice which is facing Father Seromba today.  And Father Seromba is today the victim, after many others, who are well-known or anonymous, powerful or modest, rich or poor.  How many women and men have suffered from such lies?  At the time when I'm speaking, Your Honours of the Tribunal, I'm thinking of Jean François Emmanuel Kayiranga, and Emmanuel (sic) Nturiye, priests who have unjustly been accused, thrown into prison and condemned to death by their courts before the accusations and finally ended up being acquitted.  I'm also thinking of Mister -- of Monsieur Augustin Misago, Bishop of Gikongoro, who was thrown into prison in Kigali and acquitted after having spent several months in prison.  Why not mention today the former public accuser, Pasteur Bizimungu, former head of state, who is today and finally -- Guy Theunis, who is today being held in Kigali. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Monthé, understood. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I was saying that just near us Father Guy Theunis is still being held in Kigali for reasons one doesn't know.  The machine which is destroying all these people can start running at any time and the list of names is long of those who have fallen in the public square. 

Calomnie is a secular and ordinary evil which happens to many people.  We know that a modern nation free and democratic, such as Rwanda should be, has the right under -- has the right to fairly try all its citizens.  And this is why, tired of this campaign of disinformation of lies against him, when as he has -- he came into the priesthood in Florence in Italy, that Father Athanase Seromba, listening to his conscience only and his faith in justice, convinced of his innocence as had been his fellow countrymen, Jean François Emmanuel Kayiranga and Édouard Nturiye have come to be before you, this Tribunal, this International Tribunal.  Yes, Father Seromba voluntarily surrendered himself to international justice in Arusha so that his destiny be completed and accomplished by the will of his Lord.  

For years, right now, Father Seromba is a victim which can cause trouble in the mind, and this is because he belongs to an ethnic group and he is being accused in the most ignoble manner.  

However, I would like to solemnly say to your Tribunal that the fact of being Hutu should not constitute before your Tribunal a presumption of responsibility in whatever nature -- of whatever nature. 

Madam President, Your Honours, it is written in the gospel, in Ecclesiastics, "If you go for justice," and I quote, "If you go for justice, you will find it.  You will wear it as a robe, and birds search for those that are like them, and truth comes to those who practice it."

And this is why Father Athanase Seromba came to you here in Arusha, Your Honours.  And please, don't, like General De Gaulle, say, "He wanted to be tried and he was.  Because of the state, he needs to be condemned, but a state never capitulates."

Madam President, Your Honours, according to the Statutes of this Tribunal, you are not representing any state.  You are the embodiment of justice, international justice, which we, in the Defence, wish still to believe in.  You are independent Judges, say the basic texts of this Tribunal, even if some observers in -- of your Tribunal does not share this opinion.  But often this is rightly so.  I'm saying this because today is an opportunity for the man that I am, or the lawyer that I am, I must say what I feel and what I think, and I am addressing Your Honours. 

In fact, and I must say this, that before your Tribunal, there is the balance of trials and the Rules of Procedure and Evidence say that the law must be stable, and the Latinist says, "Lex debet ergo esse: Possibilis, honestas, iustas stabilis."  

Never in the history of a civilised nation has a judicial court had power to draw up its own rules or to change them with such ease.  Before the International Criminal Tribunal there are considerable breaches of rights of the accused, and Michael Scharf, in his book "Balkan Justice", page 67, says, "To minimise a possibility of an acquittal does not depend on lack of evidence."  It is true that before your jurisdiction everything is in favour of your -- of the Prosecution, even the Rules of Procedure, and Howard Morrisson, the Anglo-Saxon lawyer in his book "International Criminal Tribunal, Counsel Magazine", issue of June 2001 at page 15, "Institutional disequilibrium between the Defence and the Prosecution is so great that it hits at the very heart at the principle of effective legal representation."

Yes, the Prosecutor is at once and the same time a part of justice and a body of the Tribunal.  The Prosecutor has privileges and immunities, exemptions and facilities accorded to diplomatic officers, and this is Article 29 of the Statute. 

The rules of procedure of the Tribunal can be modified by a Judge, by the Prosecutor, or by the Registrar, and this is article -- Rule 6 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 

Rule 39 of the Rules of Procedure -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I would have preferred to allow you to proceed, but I think that you are missing the mark.  I think you need to come to the crux of the matter, instead of making or doing the trial on behalf of the Chamber.  I wish that you would come to what is of particular interest to us; in other words, the defence of Father Seromba.
MR. MONTHÉ:  
With all due respect, Madam President, I am not doing the trial for the Chamber; I am preparing for the defence of Father Seromba, and I believe that, because I have practised law for a long time, that the lawyer is free to choose his means of defence, and you cannot enjoin me to say what I have to say or what I would say.  I have not lacked any courtesy to the Chamber.  I am saying that I need to say what my submissions are, and I have an analysis.  I am giving you references.  Maybe you are free to share my point of view, but I intend to continue because what I wish to say does agree with what my client wishes.  I thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may be stopped once again by the Presiding Judge, but continue, hoping that now we are going to deal with the essence of your -- you are going into rhetorics now.  Please, try and be a bit more precise.  
MR. MONTHÉ:  
Madam President, I do not (microphones overlapping).  Madam President, Father Seromba came here voluntarily and he wishes a certain number of things to be said.  If you want me to say them, let me say them.  If not, I will sit down.  I cannot -- I have defended clients everywhere and I have never been interrupted.  If you do not wish me to continue, I'll stop.  But I cannot cut my submissions because I'm not saying anything which is discourteous to the Chamber and it is not me who is speaking.  I'm quoting other people.  It's not through lack of respect of the Chamber that I'm going to speak like this. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you may proceed.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you have well chosen your quotations.  
MR. MONTHÉ:  
Thank you.  You see that this goes straight to the heart.  You see that we have difficulty in defending ourselves.

Let me proceed.  

Rule 39 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence say, "In the conduct of an investigation, the Prosecutor may summon and question suspects, interview victims and witnesses, and record their statements, collect evidence, and conduct on-site investigations.  We know that in a modern system this role is relegated to the police."

Madam President, Your Honours, I would like to share with you what Colonel Luc Marchal wrote.  He was a commander of the Kigali secteur of UNAMIR in December 1993 to April 1994.  He was a former commander of territorial interforces and he spoke -- he wrote a book entitled "The Death of the Ten Belgian Blue Helmets in Kigali", and I quote:

"It's now three years since I have been Arusha (sic).  Once again, a manipulation.  It is made -- people made -- people are made to believe that justice is being made rendered, but that's far from it.  The International Tribunal was installed in order to try the Hutus, and not the Tutsis, who are guilty of the same acts.  One is made to believe that justice is being rendered, and witnesses are brought who are imposters, and all this costs millions of dollars to the international community.  I am continuing with the desire to look at the Rwandan issue, because I can swear on my honour that the head of state of the gendarmerie was biased.  

There are going to be presidential elections in Rwanda soon and he will be elected.  Suddenly he has become a political refugee and he was placed on a list of genociders, and the authorities of Kigali update the lists on a regular basis. 

In Arusha, it is the Anglo-Saxon law which is in place, and the Defence -- there is a Defence and there's the Prosecution, but each has to deal with the possibility of innocence or guilt.  

He was also on the list of genociders and he abandoned everything, and that's how it happens all over.  I'm speaking about all this because I know what I'm talking about.  I know these Rwandans.  I was in contact with them within my duties in UNAMIR.  There is a constant manipulation and it is very difficult to strike a balance."

In the trial that we are in today, the Prosecutor has said that it is dealing with Father Seromba who has all the handicaps because he is a Hutu and he is a priest, or because he is a priest and a Hutu, two qualities which one should not have today in Rwanda.  How can one be a priest, and remember -- we need to remember the priests who were killed when the government entered -- when the army entered Rwanda in 1994. 

Similarly, when we talk about Dreyfus, he asked, "Can a Jew be innocent?"  I'm asking can a Hutu be innocent?  Father Seromba, knowing all this very well, however freely and voluntarily surrendered to you, Your Honours, on the 6th of February 2002, because the worst catastrophe for a man is to have a miserable existence and to lose what provides him with reason to live; in other words, honour.  Furthermore, aware of the probative value of the submissions of the Defence, and convinced that the Prosecutor has not been able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the facts alleged against him; that it is for these reasons that he is here before you in this Chamber.  

Respectful of the law, as the Chinese Lao Tseu said, when he said that the vassaux wanted to over-throw his empire, having seen the generals, the last said that all heads which pass before us have to be cut off.  The emperor wanted to be convinced, and so said to Lao Tseu that this is a difficult problem, and he, the philosopher, responded that it was necessary to respect qualifications; in other words, standards and law.  We need to, therefore, apply the law. 

When I was a young lawyer, I learned that the rule of law is not -- did not exist without an independent bench.  In this regard, Your Honours, one of the lawyers in the Paris bar, Henri Torres, while he was still a young man, said to Robert Badinter the following, and I quote:  

"Justice, my friend, is not your job.  You will not render justice.  You will not decide anything.  You will not condemn anyone.  You cannot even acquit anyone.  Your job is to defend.  You understand, my boy, it's very simple.  Do not say what I'm doing is for justice.  Sometimes it is true, sometimes it is not.  But in any case, it's not important.  What is important is that you do everything to defend your man.  I'm not saying that you have to give him a sword or a revolver or corrupt the judges.  Maybe one is too weak to do that, too cowardly.  But finally, you have to do what you have to do."

So, Your Honours, who are you judging?  Who are you trying?  Athanase Seromba was born on 25th October 1963 from a modest family, a family of farmers, in Mataba cellule, Rugote secteur, in Rutsiro commune, in the préfecture of Kibuye in Rwanda.  He did his primary school in the Nile crest in Rwanda, and then he went to the major seminary in Rutongo in Kigali for his secondary education.  He did two years of philosophy in Butare at the major seminary in Nyakibamda and he was ordained a priest on the 18th of July 1993 at the -- his native parish of Nile crest, Zaire, in Rutsiro commune.  

In August 1993 he was appointed to Gisenyi where he replaced Harolimana who was then on leave.  At the end of September 1993, Athanase Seromba was appointed to Nyange parish in Kivumu commune and he was the vicar for Father Straton Karanganwa. 

Madam President, Your Honours, this is a person who stands to be tried before you.  He is a priest without any record, any criminal record, and he is accused of crimes, the most heinous of crimes.  I have followed this trial since its beginning and I studied the indictment very closely.  And if I were allowed today to make my feelings known, I would say, Your Honours, that on the Defence team we have felt that this indictment was rather a cut and paste job in order to draw your attention to coming to a conviction.  You see, in such a serious trial, which must obviously be developed within our hearts, and then in the international community, we need to know that we have to rise above ourselves.  Before we come to you, we have to give you what we feel as our -- that are our ideas.  

However, I should mention that the tragic events of Nyange parish, situated in Nyange secteur, in Kivumu commune, can be found in the NGO African Rights and its testimony which is very linked to the powers that be in Rwanda from September 1994 and concerning the massacres of Tutsi refugees in the Nyange church. 

In this association which has been -- involved the Rwandan government, Father Seromba, the priest of that parish, together with the communal authorities, allegedly prepared and organised these killings which ended up in the destruction of the church which -- to which he had been assigned. 

This is what is being said by many persons, and there have been publication of such in a document which was known as "Rwanda:  Death, Despair and Defiance," published in 1995. 

African Rights Association spread the rumour, amplified it to the extent that it was convinced that it could play the role of Prosecutor by editing a document which was Prosecution bulletin number 2, Father Athanase Seromba, priest of the Florence parish in Italy which was disclosed to the Defence by the Prosecutor in the abovementioned manuscript, African Rights, November 1999.  There is mention of dates and places for where such interviews allegedly took place. 

Most of the accusations are derived from this famous Prosecution bulletin, issue number 2.  But the testimony on which the bulletin relies, with footnotes giving dates, has never been published by African Rights, and therefore the authenticity of these statements cannot be verified, such that the admission of this document as an exhibit is strongly challenged and contested by the Defence, as are also articles from the Italian press inspired by that document and tendered in the trial by the Prosecution. 

The case of the Prosecution relies on the so-called protagonists of the Nyange drama and mentioned in documents of African Rights, some of which have been called as witnesses by the Prosecutor and have come before your Chamber to contest the legality of these documents, and I'm thinking in particular of Witness CBJ, and remove all probative value from these documents, and this enables me to say that, according to the provisions of the Statute of this Tribunal, the Prosecutor should be a servant of international law, but also should be a zealous servant of the government of Kigali, otherwise we would have never seen such an indictment, whose narration of facts, legal construction and arguments only surprise me, and I am going to look at it together with you. 

Far from being a teacher, I would like to remind you that Article 20(4)(a) of the Statute says that any person should be informed promptly and in detail, and in a language which he or she understands, of the nature and cause of the charge against him or her.  When we look at the indictment as an analysis, which has brought Father Athanase Seromba before you, we are surprised by the vice -- by the defects in the indictment. 

Article 20, which I was quoting a moment ago, talks about nature and cause, and what do these words mean in this article?  The nature of the accusation is the qualification, precise qualification of the offence, and that is what this is based on.  However, the allegations made by the Prosecutor, Madam President, Your Honours, in the indictment are vague.  They are imprecise and do not inform the Accused in a satisfactory manner.  

Be that as it may, Father Athanase Seromba pleaded not guilty to all the counts.  He contests the allegations made throughout the indictment.  The Accused Athanase Seromba pleaded not guilty to the charge of genocide under Article 2(3)(a), and this is Count 1, and the Accused Athanase Seromba contests the alternative count of complicity in genocide, pursuant to Article 2(3)(e), and this is Count 2, and all allegations made by the Prosecutor in order to provide basis to this count. 

The Accused Athanase Seromba contests the charge of conspiracy to commit genocide, and this is Count 3. 

Accused Athanase Seromba contests and challenges the offence of crime against humanity (extermination), provided by Article 2(3)(b) of the Statute, Count 4, and all allegations provided by the Prosecution.  He also contests all allegations of positive acts in order to commit these crimes under criminal individual responsibility, Article 6(1) of the Statute.  He also contests specific allegations included in the indictment and containing the supplementary elements of the crimes. 

Athanase Seromba contests all the allegations of the factual allegations made against him by the Prosecutor, and with regard to the specific allegations, these are related to facts and acts attributed to the Accused by witnesses through statements made in compliance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 

We have analysed the counts alleged by the Prosecution, the first being genocide, with the abovementioned offence in the indictment filed by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, accuses Athanase Seromba of genocide under Article 2(3)(a) as mentioned above.  The Prosecution says that Athanase Seromba was responsible for murder or serious bodily or mental harm committed to destroy, in whole or in part, a racial group -- a racial or ethnic group.  Pursuant to Article 6(1) of the Statute, the Accused is allegedly accused of having planned, incited to commit, ordered the commission of these acts.  We cannot mention this act -- this count without providing a definition which comes from Article 2 of the statute which states that:

"Genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group as such; killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction, in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.  The following shall be punishable:  Genocide; conspiracy to committal genocide; direct and public incitement to commit genocide; attempts to commit genocide; complicity in genocide."  

We need to say that the imprecise nature of the indictment does not need to be proven anymore.  During the events of the present indictment, Father Seromba was the priest and responsible for Nyange parish.  I shall stop here a few moments, Madam President, Your Honours, to say that Father Seromba was never responsible for Nyange parish.  I said when I began my submissions that he came there in September 1993 as a vicar for Father Straton who was the priest for the parish. 
(Pages 1 to 11 by Jennifer Spring)




1530H 
MR. MONTHÉ (continuing):
So he had been there for roughly six months and, consequently, he could have no responsibility, therefore.  Let me add, for the record, that on the 6th of April 1994, during the presbyterial meeting in Nyundo, Father Athanase Seromba had been assigned to the parish, Zaire du Nil parish on the following day, the 7th of April.  He was not there in the events that took place subsequently, and this appears that his replacement in Nyange, Father Balthazar Habimana, was already in place when the events began.  Therefore, he could in no way be responsible for that parish, and this claim by the Prosecution which wants to justify an indictment which is not based on anything is pointless.  

In the matter of the Prosecutor v. Semanza, case No.  ICTR-97-20-T, the Chamber states that "If the indictment has defects and does not allow the Accused to respond, these defects must be sanctioned by the Chamber."  This is how, when it comes to the offence of genocide, at no point at all in the indictment, Your Honours, do you see or will you ever see specified the length and breadth of the participation of the Accused in order to materialise the allegations.  However, Article 6(1) of the Statute indicates that when the Prosecutor says that an accused person has committed a criminal offence in the meaning of this article, the indictment must be -- must identify the victims and the ways and means by which those acts were committed, and this is from the Semanza judgement.  

In the matter of the Prosecutor v. Rutaganda, paragraph 303, the Chamber underscored, and I quote, "Before considering that an alleged fact is not essential given the differences in the writing of the indictment, a normal Chamber -- a Chamber should normally find that there is no prejudice that results from the indictment for the Accused."  In that judgement, the Chamber indicates that such prejudice would be an imprecision which would mislead the accused on the criminal conduct for which he is accused.  

In the Semanza trial, paragraph 59, the Chamber admits, and I quote, that "The Prosecutor may make allegations of more than a kind of participation in a crime, but underscores the facts that the submissions of the Prosecutor which refers generally to Article 6(1), without being more specific in the alleged acts of the Accused makes that each -- makes that each form of participation as alleged is vague.  We are also going to quote Prosecutor v. Krnojelac, paragraph 138:  "For his part the absence of precision in the indictment as for the forms of the alleged responsibility by the Prosecutor leads to an ambiguity.  The Appeals Chamber considers that such ambiguity should be avoided.  It is therefore of the opinion that it is necessary that the Prosecutor indicates as soon as possible for each count where the forms of responsibility are alleged."  

By way of example, in the indictment which is of interest to us, at page 112, the Prosecutor says that Athanase Seromba, and I quote, "Athanase Seromba, priest who was responsible for Nyange parish, and other persons unknown to the Prosecution, prepared and executed a plan for the extermination of the Tutsi population," without the Prosecution being able to specify the nature of that alleged plan, where it was planned and where it was conceived.  

Similarly, the Prosecutor says, at paragraph 5, on page 112, "Following the death of the Rwandan president on the 6th of April 1994, attacks began to be perpetrated against the Tutsis in Kivumu commune, causing the death of some civilian Tutsis.  This new affirmation by the Prosecution does not enable us to tell who perpetrated these attacks, at what place in the commune did they take place, and was Father Seromba a part of the group of attackers.  

In Paragraph 7 of the indictment the Prosecutor claims, and I quote, "The bourgmestre and the communal police brought together the refugees from the different secteurs of Kivumu commune and transported them to the parish."  The indictment does not say when the Tutsis were transported and why were they transported to the church.  

Paragraph 8 of that indictment says that Father Athanase Seromba allegedly got information about the Tutsis who were not yet there, took down the names of them on the list and then he gave it to Bourgmestre Grégoire Ndahimana so that they be looked for and led to the parish.  The indictment does not indicate when Father Seromba asked the refugees about those who were still on the hilltops, nor when he asked the question and how he was able to know that there were still Tutsis on the hilltops, he who was only in Nyange for six months.  The Prosecutor does not say who saw the list, what became of it, nor does it indicate the short period during which Father Seromba would have established that list or even where he may have established it.  

And here I refer you, just out of curiosity, to the Appeals Chamber judgement, Prosecutor v. Bagambiki, Imanishimwe.  In the same way the Prosecution claims in its indictment that during the meetings that allegedly took place in Nyange it was decided to request gendarmes from Kibuye préfecture in order to, and I quote, "gather the refugees in the church with a goal to exterminate them."  I refer you to paragraph 11.  

Madam President, Your Honours, I regret to tell you that that assertion by the Prosecution is in total contradiction with the legislative decree of January 1994 creating the gendarmerie, specifically, its articles 8, 2, 9.24, 28, 29, 31 and 35, published in the official gazette of 1974, page 123.  I repeat that this is the legislative decree of 23 January 1994 creating the gendarmerie, published in the official gazette of 1974, page 123.  To illustrate what I am saying, I would like to quote some of the provisions of that law.  Article 8 of that text provides -- Article 8(ii):  "Without prejudice to the above-mentioned law, when in the exercise of their functions the members of the national gendarmerie are charged with dispersing crowds or controlling riots, they can only use firearms with prior requisitions from the administrative authorities."  

Article 24 of the same text says, "The national gendarmerie assures the public order and secures public order only when it is legally requisitioned."  Article 28 says that "The members of the national gendarmerie are placed under their superiors in the hierarchy."  In Nyange, that person was not Athanase Seromba.  In that capacity he could not give any orders or instructions to anyone.  

Article 29 of the same text, Madam President, Your Honours, provides authority of the administrative officials is exercised with regard to the national gendarmerie by requisitioning that force.  For the gendarmes to move anywhere, they have to be legally requisitioned by the competent authorities.  

Finally, article 31 of that same text specifies all requisitions must be in writing.  They must mention the legal provision under which requisition is made, must indicate the goal to be achieved, the part of the country and where that force is supposed to go.  The requisition must be dated and including the names, ranks and signature of the authorities.  No one can send the gendarmerie to go and kill or commit violent acts without such requisition.  According to Prosecution witnesses, when the gendarmes arrived in Nyange, the attacks had not yet reached the scale that we know they did.  As such, those assertions made by the Prosecution must be closely examined.  

Madam President, Your Honours, in paragraph 14 of its indictment, the Prosecution argues that Father Seromba allegedly sent four Tutsi employees who were at the parish -- rather, forced them to leave the parish.  They were named Alex, Félicien, Gasore and Patrice.  In no way does the Prosecution establish that those people were indeed Tutsis, nor why Mr. Seromba -- Father Seromba, rather, would have sacked them.  

In paragraph 15 of its indictment, the Prosecution maintains that Father Seromba closed the door of the church to stop the refugees from coming in, but he does not indicate who was giving the order.  Did he give the order to a refugee?  To a militiaman?  Who?  None of this figures in the indictment.  

Paragraph 16 of that same instrument mentions meetings, notably that of 14 April 1994.  Prosecution does not indicate what the nature of Father Seromba's participation in the meeting was, nor the link that there could be between his participation in the meeting and the fact for Fulgence Kayishema to go and look for petrol.  

In paragraph 17, nothing is specified about how Father Seromba allegedly chaired the meeting.  We have no idea how many meetings there were on that day.  The Prosecution does not establish in which capacity Father Seromba could have given orders to the Interahamwe and to militiamen.  Was he their superior?  A superior can order.  The Prosecution does not establish what the relationship between Father Seromba and the Interahamwe was.  Furthermore, we do not know who those Interahamwe were, where they came from.  Were they from Kivumu?  Were they from somewhere else?  All of that is foreign to us.  

Given the aforesaid, those allegations are vague, just like the Tribunal held in Prosecutor v. Ntagerura, Bagambiki, Imanishimwe, paragraph 64.  And in the Appeals Chamber decision in Kupreskic, the Chamber does not see any valid reason authorising the Prosecutor to make or bring allegations in such a vague and general way, paragraph 114 of the said judgement.  

In summary, Madam President, to convict an accused of genocide, your Chamber must be convinced that he had the requisite intention to be punished for the crimes enumerated in Article 2 of the Statute.  It must be demonstrated that the presumed author of the crime committed one of the enumerated acts with the intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a group as such, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group benefiting from protection as enshrined in Article 2 of the Statute and as illustrated by the Ntakirutimana judgement or the Musema judgement, paragraph 164.  

For there to be genocide, there must necessarily be the existence of mens rea, in other words, the willingness, intention to commit the act.  Those conditions must be met for that mens rea to exist.  First, we must establish that the person who is accused seriously harmed the physical or mental integrity of the victim and did so because they belonged to a protected group.  

Secondly, it must be demonstrated that the presumed author of the crime had the intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a person belonging to that group.  And the jurisprudence speaks at length.  Mens rea can be summed up by the actions of the presumed author of the crime, but in the absence of a confession or any other type of acknowledgement of the facts, it is difficult to prove the genocidal intent of the accused.  Please refer to the Semanza judgement, paragraphs 312 and 313.  

For the purposes of the record, Madam President, Your Honours, nowhere in the indictment does it say that Father Seromba acknowledged anything, made any confession with regard to the alleged facts, nor was he ever in any position to commit genocidal acts.  

Madam President, Your Honours, as described by the Statute, the crime in the definition includes the word "destroy," and jurisprudence helps us to define that word "destroy."  The wording of Article 2 of the Statute establishes that the Prosecutor must demonstrate that the presumed author of the crime committed the prohibited acts with intent to destroy a group.  That is what the jurisprudence says.  The drafters of the Tribunal Statute repeated in texto the definition of genocide given by the genocide convention, but they clearly limited the sense of the word "destroy," limiting it to any constituted acts of genocide, be they physical or biological.  Refer to Semanza judgement, paragraph 313.  Not only must one destroy, but in whole or in part.  Again, the jurisprudence speaks at length about this issue, "in whole or in part." 

Since there's no minimum requirement with regard to the number of victims for there to be genocide, the Prosecutor must demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the author of the crime had the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, the group as such.  This is indicated in the Rutaganda judgement, paragraph 60, and the Semanza judgement, paragraph 165.  Moreover, the intent to destroy must target at least a substantial part of the group, as the Bagilishema judgement reminds us, paragraph 64.  But those groups must also be protected.  That is the third element.  

The Statute is very vague with regard to this issue.  The group targeted by the intention of the genocide must be defined according to the objective or subjective criteria, on the basis of which those criteria lie.  The various Chambers of the Tribunal concluded that the question of whether or not one of the groups benefit from protection must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis with regard to the social, historical context and objective considerations.  This is included in the aforementioned Semanza judgement, paragraph 317.  

I told you, Madam President, that the basic element was the mens rea.  There's a second element, actus reus.  Article 2(2) of the Statute lists the constituent elements of actus reus, notably, causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group.  Serious harm is not defined by the Statute.  However, looking at the Kayishema and Ruzindana judgments, Prosecutor v. Kayishema and Ruzindana, the Chamber held that serious harm, bodily or mental harm, means any act which seriously harms the health of the victim or which has the effect to disfigure that person or to seriously alter their external organs, as confirmed in Kayishema and Ruzindana, paragraph 109.
  
The Statute does not define serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group.  The Chamber held that it must be serious harm and not minor or temporary harm to the mental faculties of the victim.  This is included in the Semanza judgement, paragraph 321.  

Furthermore, the fact that the Accused must have the intention to destroy, in whole or in part, the group as such.  The following elements must be established to demonstrate that the Accused committed the crime of genocide and caused serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group.  It must be established that the Accused had the intent to seriously harm the physical integrity of several members of the national, ethnical, racial or religious group as the Semanza judgement, paragraph 323, reminds us.  In this case, Madam President, Your Honours, the Prosecution did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the crime was committed by Mister -- Father, rather, Seromba.  

Also in the indictment is the idea of forcibly imposing measures -- or rather, deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction, in whole or in part.  Conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part was not defined by the Statute, and the Prosecution has failed to demonstrate in its case those acts.  

Now, with regard to complicity in genocide -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, how much longer do you have?  You said between one hour and one hour and a half.  That was the time you needed for your opening statement. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
I'm in the middle of this statement, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we know.  How much more time do you think you'll need?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Perhaps 45 minutes, Madam President.  We shall see.  I am not defending a chicken thief, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We never said as much, Counsel.  Please try to wrap up in a half an hour.  That would benefit us a great deal because we would like to start with our first witness.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I brought the first witness.  I don't see how I can start that witness before I finish with my opening statement.  I don't know what the Chamber wants.  Do they want me to continue?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We simply ask you to respect what you said in the beginning.  Yes, you are in the heart of the matter but, please, make an attempt to respect the time limits that you yourself set out.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, that was simply an indication.  That is the practice before this Chamber and the Tribunal.  And the Defence always will have the last word.  We are detained; we are defending.  We have said we don't have anything to prove, but in fact the burden of proof lies on our shoulders. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please proceed and please try to respect to the extent possible the time limits that you set out. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Now, let's get to complicity in genocide, second count.  In the indictment, Prosecution accuses Father Seromba of complicity in genocide under Article 2(3) of the Statute, in that on the 6th of April 1994 and the 20th of April 1994, on or around those dates, in Kivumu commune, Kibuye préfecture, Rwanda, Athanase Seromba was an accomplice to the killing or causing serious or bodily mental harm to members of the Tutsi population with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a racial or ethnic group.  This is under Article 6(1) of the Statute.  

In the specific case of that crime, according to the indictment, the Prosecution bases itself on the same facts to accuse the Accused with genocide and complicity in genocide.  Jurisprudence considers that genocide and complicity in genocide are two different forms of participating in the same crime.  Let me refer to Prosecutor v. Akayesu, case ICTR-96-4-T, in which the Chamber underscored the same facts for which an accused is charged cannot be at the same time constitutive of genocide and complicity in genocide for that accused.  That mutual exclusion of qualification of genocide and complicity in genocide has the consequence that the same person cannot be found guilty of the two crimes on the basis of the same facts.  The Chamber concluded that an accused can only be convicted of genocide and complicity -- cannot be convicted, rather, of genocide and complicity in genocide on the basis of the same facts.  

That was the same definition the Chamber had in the Musema trial, paragraph 168 to 175 of that judgement, as well as Prosecutor v. Ignace Bagilishema, case ICTR-95-1-T.  

Now, with regard to the material element of complicity in genocide, the jurisprudence of this Tribunal analysed the common law system, as well as the continental system, and Article 91 of the Rwandan Criminal Code which stipulates and talks about the notion of complicity.  In light of those different elements, they've defined the elements of complicity.  

Regarding the moral element of complicity in genocide, it rests, as the Chamber tell us in Akayesu, the principal author must consciously want to commit the crime of genocide.  Consequently, the accomplice doesn't necessarily have the dolus specialis to commit genocide, but he supplies aid and assistance or instigates or supplies means to the principal author to commit the genocide and is fully aware of the cause of an intent of the principal author to destroy, in whole or in part, a national ethnical, racial or religious group as such, Bagilishema, paragraph 71.  

Now, let's go to conspiracy to commit genocide.  The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda also accuses Father Athanase Seromba of that crime, in that between the 6th and 20th April 1994, or on or and those dates, in Kibuye préfecture, Athanase Seromba conspired with Grégoire Ndahimana, bourgmestre of Kivumu commune, Fulgence Kayishema, inspector of police of Kivumu commune, and Télesphore Ndungutse, Gaspard Kanyarukiga, and other persons unknown by the Prosecution to kill members of the Tutsi population or cause serious bodily or mental harm to them with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a racial or ethnical group.  This is punishable under Article 6(1) of the Statute.  These charges are contained in 33 to 47, those paragraphs of the Prosecution's indictment.  

The Prosecution limits itself to the meetings during which Father Seromba was, but does not specify the nature of his participation in the meetings.  The paragraph mentioned by the Prosecution are void of any specificity regarding the moment and place where Father Seromba allegedly made anti-Tutsi statements.  It does not specify the nature and content of what he may have said, nor does it establish a link between those statements and the underlying crimes.  Prosecution fails to demonstrate the specific role that Father Seromba played in those meetings which led to the crimes mentioned above.  In this case, the Prosecution did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Father Seromba committed a conspiracy to commit genocide.  

The last count against Mr. Seromba, crimes against humanity (extermination).  The Prosecution accuses Father Seromba of crimes against humanity (extermination) in that between the 7th and 20th of April 1994, in Kibuye préfecture, Athanase Seromba was responsible for killing persons or causing persons to be killed during mass killings -- killing events as part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population on political, ethnic or racial grounds, pursuant to Article 6(1) of the Statute, by virtue of his affirmative acts in planning, instigating, ordering, committing or otherwise aiding or abetting the planning, preparation or execution of the crime charged.  

Article 3 of the Statute defines crimes against humanity and says the following: "The International Tribunal for Rwanda should have the power to prosecute persons responsible for the following crimes when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population on national, political, ethnic, racial or religious grounds."  And then the list:  murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, imprisonment, torture, rape, persecutions on political, racial and religious ground, other inhumane acts.  

In this case, Father Seromba must answer to one crime against humanity, that is of extermination.  The wording of Article 3 of the Statute is mostly inspired from Article 6(c) of the statute of the Nuremberg Tribunals, London Accords, August 1945.  Indeed, in international customary law, crimes against humanity must be led against a civilian population and are punishable whether or not they were committed during an armed conflict, international or otherwise; Akayesu judgement, paragraph 565.  However, the Security Council adopts a more strict definition by stipulating that the attacks must be led in a discriminatory attack.  

In our case, three elements must come together:  widespread attack, incriminating attack and the moral element.  What is the widespread attack?  The acts committed must be committed in the framework of a generalised or systematic attack against a civilian population on the basis of its national, political ethnic or religious basis.  It must also be widespread or systematic, widespread against many victims.  Systematic is on the basis of some type of policy.  It must be either systematic or widespread, not both.  That is what the Blaskic judgement and Bagilishema judgements tell us.  The crimes must also be led against a civilian population.  The targeted population must essentially be civilian in nature; the concrete situation of the victim is that, rather than its legal status, must be taken into account.  This is what the Tadic and Bagilishema judgments tell us, paragraphs 79 and 80. 

Discriminatory motives.  This Tribunal requires that the widespread attack must be led against a civilian population on the basis of its -- on the basis of national, political, ethnical or racial or religious grounds.  Refer to Akayesu, ICTR-96-4-A.  

Finally, punishable acts must have been committed.  They must be committed in the framework of a generalised or systematic attack led against a civilian population on the basis on national, political, ethnical or racial or religious grounds, rather.  All of the crimes listed include moral and material elements unique to them.  With regard to Father Seromba, with regard to crimes against humanity, he's only charged with extermination.  

I must tell you, with regard to extermination, the jurisprudence of this Tribunal is very thin.  In the Akayesu judgement, the Chamber declared that extermination is a crime led by definition against a group of individuals and that elements of massive destruction differentiates it from murder.  The Chamber illustrates this, in that Jean-Paul Akayesu ordered the death of 16 persons.  See judgement, paragraphs 735 to 744.  In that case, the Chamber held that extermination was, in fact, killing on a large scale in violation of the law.  Widespread does not include the determination of a defined number of victims, and that that must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.  Nevertheless, the crime can be committed if the author gives - or, kills one single person or submits that person to conditions of life that will bring about that person's death on the condition that the perpetrator is aware of his acts or omissions in the framework to commit widespread killings.  The Chamber lays this out in Kayishema and Ruzindana, paragraph 144.  

The Chamber described the constitutive elements of crime.  There are three of them.  The perpetrator, by his acts or omissions, must have first participated in widespread killings or subjected people to conditions of existence that would bring about their death on a wide scale; second, have the intention to kill or have serious disregard for them; third, be conscious of the fact that the acts or omissions were committed in the framework of widespread killings.  
The moral element of the crime.  The moral element of a crime establishes the link between an incriminating act and the criminal context in which it was committed.  In this case, the accused must mentally know that his crimes were committed in the framework of a generalised widespread attack.  In paragraphs 48 to 50 of the Prosecution's indictment, in no way can we characterise the crime of crimes against humanity; in no way can Mr. Seromba be accused of that.  The Prosecution has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the commission of a crime against humanity or extermination.  

On the individual criminal responsibility of Father Seromba, I have looked at genocide with you, complicity in genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide and crimes against humanity.  He's charged with the crimes on the basis -- or, rather under Article 6(1) of the Statute.  To engage that criminal responsibility of an accused, we must look at Article 6(1) of the Statute, which stipulates, "A person who planned, instigated, ordered, committed or otherwise aided and abetted in the planning, preparation or execution of a crime referred to in Articles 2 to 4 of the present Statute shall be individually responsible for the crime."  So this is a principle that is laid out.  There is not only criminal responsible for the material act but also for participation with others to execute the said crime.  This is the meaning of the Kayishema and Ruzindana jurisprudence, paragraph 185.  

Under Article 6(1) the jurisprudence describes a few notions.  It starts by describing planning.  In paragraph 30 of Bagilishema and paragraph 38 of Semanza, it says that planning of a crime supposes that one or several persons planned the commission of a crime, both in its phase of preparation and in executing the crime.  The degree of the participation must be substantial.  For example, they can come up with a plan, criminal plan, proposed by others.  

Next, inciting to commit.  Inciting means to push, to encourage, to provoke others, to commit a crime.  Incitement must not necessarily be direct and public.  The causal link between indictment and commission of the crime must be established.  Refer to Bagilishema, paragraph 30, and Semanza, paragraph 38.  

One must also order.  The principle of criminal responsibility also plays in the case of an individual who uses their position of authority to order the commission of a crime and force another person under his authority to commit the crime.  Criminal responsibility of a person who orders the commission of a crime under the Statute supposes the existence of a subordinate relationship between the person who orders and the person who executes the crime.  

Finally, one must commit.  Committing means direct participation, physically or personally, through the commission of the crimes which constitute the material elements of a crime described in the Statute; Semanza, paragraph 383.  
Finally, aiding and encouraging -- aiding and abetting, rather, to plan or execute the crime.  From the Tribunal's jurisprudence, aiding and abetting means any material assistance and support for the commission of the crime.   There is a necessity for mens rea for the -- that responsibility to be upheld.  

In the case of complicity, the required mens rea must be proven if the accused voluntarily participates and knows that his influence over the author of the crime exists.  Those concepts also apply to conspiracy to commit genocide and complicity in genocide as defined under Articles 2 and 3 of the Statute.  In this case, Madam President, Your Honours, the Prosecutor in its indictment has not established beyond a reasonable doubt the individual criminal responsibility of Father Seromba in the events that took place in Nyange.  In the same way, the Prosecution has not established, and in this case not at all, the nature of his authority, of Father Seromba's authority, in Nyanga as a priest, nor did the Prosecution establish that Father Seromba had de jure authority over the crimes or de facto authority over those in Kivumu commune.  

It's useful and important to note that in that indictment the Prosecution led no material evidence.  The indictment against Mr. Seromba is based solely on testimony, the probative value of which has never been established during their testimony.  However, we should look at the indictment and in the Prosecution's specific allegations.  They make reference to the following witnesses:  CBQ, CBR, CBV, CBY, CBO, CBT and CBM.  They referred to those witnesses to support their indictment.  The Defence regretfully says that the Prosecution did not bring the witnesses referred to -- in the indictment to testify before the Chamber, and the Defence was not able to cross-examine them, clearly in violation of Article 20 of the Statute.  

With regard to Witness CBJ, the witness (sic) observed that nowhere is that witness mentioned in the specific allegations in the indictment.  On the contrary, that witness came to testify before you without one really knowing, as the witness testified under Article 73 ter of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  

Madam President, I should not like to end my statement without mentioning what one of your predecessors said.  Yakov Ostrovsky, in this Chamber -- rather, in this Tribunal, along with many others such as the late President Laity Kama, Justice Pillay and others -- here is what Justice Ostrovsky said in an interview that he gave on 23rd April 2002, which was published in Diplomatie judicaire.  That judge criticised the frivolous indictment signed by Carla Del Ponte in these terms.  "The problem" -- this is what Judge Ostrovsky said -- "is that she has failed to prove her professional abilities.  I'm always dealing with non-professional indictments.  The Accused are often accused of dozens of counts in their indictments.  Often times, none of the crimes were committed.  Moreover, the Prosecution doesn't even bother to provide proof for some of the counts.  For the Judges, it is very much difficult to support such indictments.  People don't remember what happened eight years ago and they give contradictory testimony about those events."  No comment is needed on that, Madam President.  

Madam Prosecutor, the Defence thinks that you should have had the courtesy to withdraw your indictment, but you did not do that.  Herrare humanum est sed peseverare diabolicum est.  You were mistaken one time; you continue to be mistaken.  God forgive you.  

Madam President, Your Honours, this weekend I read a book by one of my excellent colleagues, Titinga Frédéric Pacere.  His book is titled African Thoughts, Proverbs, Dictums and Wisdom from the Elders.  He talks about a Burkina Faso proverb, and he says the following:  "One must judge in such a way so that after one's death, even animals, objects and plants will miss you."  

I will end by talking to you about what the king of France did.  He summoned the president of the parliament of Paris and told him, "In such-and-such a case, I want you to give such-and-such a decision."  The judge listened and left.   He arrived to the hearing, called the proceedings to order, opened the debates and gave a judgment contrary to what the judge had told him.  He was called by the king, who asked him about that contempt of him.  The president of the parliament of Paris told him, "Here the court gives out judgments, not favours."  

Madam President, Your Honours, the Prosecutor is asking you to do them a favour.  I am asking you don't grant it to them.  Thank you, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Monthé.  Is the first witness available?  

Yes, he is here.  

We are going to take a short break of 15 minutes.  We should like to resume after that break with the first witness.  Thank you.  These proceedings are adjourned.  
(Court recessed at 1403H) 
(Pages 12 to 23 by Karen Holm)









(Court resumed at 1624H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The session is called to order.  It would seem that the Prosecution has a motion to file.  

You have the floor, Prosecution. 
MS. ARBIA: 
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  I have a motion concerning the cross-examination -- or the first witness who will be called to the bar.  It is not really a motion, as such, but the Prosecution would wish to reiterate what was said during the status conference of the 27th October; namely, that the witness is going to be examined-in-chief but the Prosecution anticipates, as of now, that it will not be ready to cross-examine this witness.  The Prosecution has made all efforts possible in order to prepare for the cross-examination under conditions as mentioned during the status conference, but the results are not yet available.  And today, the Prosecution is not ready to proceed with the cross-examination of this witness.  

I also wish to submit to the Chamber that the cross-examination will not be possible because of the fact that disclosure from the Accused only deal with nine out of 26 witnesses.  Even if one were to consider that the disclosure of the identity of the Defence witnesses can be put off to a later date, disclosure of statements from all Defence witnesses must be made to the Prosecution before cross-examination of the first witness can be gone into.  The Prosecution needs to have information in order to cross-examine.  And the statements of other witnesses are essential for the cross-examination to be effective.

This matter was discussed during a meeting, a formal meeting.  And I realise that the Defence has placed a link between the disclosure of witness statements, given the observations made by the Chamber during the status conference of 5th April 2005 requesting that the Defence disclose all material in its possession concerning the Defence witnesses.  And that is not a claim being made by the Prosecution, but it was an order issued by the Chamber on the 27th of October to disclose unredacted witness statements for CF14, CF14 -- 4, FA32, BO1, PA1, CF13, PE25, BZ1-- 14, BZ1, BZ2, BZ8, BZ5, BZ4, CF23, FE6, FE27, FE31, FE34, FE35, FP -- FE35, FE55, FE56, BR1 and BRY.  

We have waited for the disclosure, but up to now that disclosure has not been affected.  So, for these two reasons, one being the late information regarding the identity of the witnesses, specifically this first witness, and witness statements from that first witness; the late nature of that disclosure has not enabled the Prosecution to prepare its cross-examination.

The second reason is that up until now, the Prosecution only has disclosure of nine witnesses out of 26; and, therefore, is not ready to determine what will be the object of the cross-examination, because it is unable to determine the Defence case for the (unintelligible).  The Chamber has been very clear in the order that it issued, as I mentioned it earlier.  And, therefore, the above reasons make it impossible for the Prosecution to proceed with the cross-examination of these witnesses.  

Thank you, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We thank Madam Prosecutor.  

Mr. Monthé, what do you have to say regarding what has been said by the Prosecution concerning the disclosure of witness statements and identities?   
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Thank you, Madam President.  I have been made to understand that I need to go quickly because the witnesses were supposed to come here; but I wasn't aware that it was because the Prosecution was going to ask us the same questions.  We met under the chairmanship of MR. Gogo, and there was a representative of the registry in order to solve problems of disclosure.  

Mr. Moses was there for the Prosecution, and the Prosecution had not complied with the orders of the 5th of April 2005.  Now they are saying that they cannot go to cross-examination because they do not have disclosure.  I said to the Chamber that we were penalised for several months because these statements were kept despite your order.  Now, is it the Defence which must implement the orders of the Chamber or is it both parties that are to comply? 

Madam President, we had said that we were going to give you a report on the issue of disclosure.  If the Prosecution complies, we will also comply with your orders in turn. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor. 
MS. ARBIA: 
Madam President, I will not repeat myself.  There is no link between the obligation to comply following the status conference of the 5th of April of this year and the Defence's obligation to disclose so that preparation can be made for cross-examination.  The two issues are distinct and different.  

We can refer to the status conference of 5th April.  What we are discussing now is the impossibility for the Prosecution to cross-examine the witness, given the two issues that I have mentioned.  I'm not going to bother the Chamber by repeating this, but we are dealing with the identity of the witnesses and witness statements which have not been made available to us and, thus, have made it impossible for us to prepare.  And there is also the non-disclosure of material pertaining to other witnesses which will help us in carrying out an effective cross-examination. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber believes that these are two distinct issues.  We have, on the one hand, statements of witnesses which the Defence intends to call here; whereas, the other matter is that it is true there is a problem of interpretation.  But here we are looking at statements made by individuals who have not been called to testify by the Prosecution.  So the grounds are really different.  Right now, we have a list of witnesses.  And it is stated that statements of nine only out of 26 witnesses have been provided, but you, Defence, have not provided the identity of those witnesses.

Now, our order is quite clear.  That last order which we issued clearly states that the Defence is immediately ordered to disclose to the Prosecution unredacted statements of various witnesses, and we provide a list.  Consequently, we do not understand why up to now these statements have not been disclosed to the Prosecution.

Now, these other people, the other witnesses who are going to be called, we are going to verify, to ensure exactly what was decided during that status conference.  And we are going to invite the Prosecution to disclose what has not been disclosed.  And this should be done within the 24 hours, the next 24 hours.  But we insist that all unredacted statements of witnesses you intend to call here be disclosed to the Prosecution because we are dealing with cross-examination.  We cannot have a situation where the Prosecution cannot cross-examine your witnesses.  And you will understand also that it is not in the interests of Defence to call to testify witnesses who will not be cross-examined by the Prosecution.  So it is very urgent that these unredacted statements being disclosed.

I also wanted to ask you something else, Mr. Monthé:  Is it possible for you to prepare the identification sheets for your witnesses because this will help us, and maybe we will be able to avoid closed sessions with regard to obtaining that information. Because you should provide all of the necessary information, as we often do, pertaining to each -- have you already done this for your witnesses - yes; very well, because if you could prepare such sheets for all of your witnesses, this would help us save time.  Furthermore, there are nine witnesses out of 26.  We want you to disclose the other documents, but we also want to say that there are five or six witnesses; I believe six who are already here.  Do you have any information concerning the other witnesses?  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, before I give you information on the witnesses, I think we shouldn't be fighting unnecessarily.  I have said to the Chamber before we separated the last time that I would come ready to start this trial on the 31st, and I have kept my promise.  I have disclosed to the Office of the Prosecutor statements of witnesses who are present and who are of interest to us.

We would not find it useful to disclose statements of witnesses which we are not even sure that they will not come.  I want us to be quite constructive in what we say.  I do not see what can hinder the Office of the Prosecutor from proceeding with the cross-examination because they have all of the information concerning the witnesses who are present.  We have the intention of having seven witnesses; six are here, one wasn't available.  And we gave to MR. Gogo and to the Office of the Prosecutor the information necessary.  And we are ready to start with the examination-in-chief of the witnesses.  

WVSS is doing its job.  The other witnesses will come when they are available.  Other than that, I have nothing else to add.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, we are going to have ushered in Witness BZ3, the first witness.  So we are asking once again that the Defence disclose all unredacted witness statements immediately.  Furthermore, we also would request the Prosecutor to try, as much as possible, to cross-examine the witnesses whose witness statements it has received in order to avoid any wastage of time.  But if there are difficulties which appear, the Chamber, obviously, will be ready to hear you and proceed to taking the necessary decisions to enable us to work under the best of circumstances.

If there are no further issues to deal with, I'm going to ask Mr. Monthé if we can have his first witness, which I believe is Witness BZ3, ushered in.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, Your Honours, Mr. Monthé is ready to receive Witness BZ3. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, can you have the first witness, BZ3, ushered in? 
(Witness enters courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Madam Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We know that you are a protected Defence witness.  You will be referred to as BZ3 in these proceedings.  You will be examined-in-chief by the Defence and then cross-examined by the Prosecution.  It is possible that the Judges put to you questions, and there will also be the possibility of re-examination by the Defence.

Before you answer questions which will be put to you, we are asking you to take your solemn declaration, and the registry will assist you in this.  Could you please, kindly, stand up in order to take your solemn declaration.
(Declaration made by the Witness BZ3 in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Madam Witness, Mr. Registry.

Mr. Monthé, your witness, do you have an identification sheet of this witness?  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Yes, Madam President.  I gave the sheet to Mr. Fry, an identification sheet which I would like the witness, BZ3, to sign so she can confirm that she is, indeed, the person.  Mr. Fry has the document, I believe. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Monthé. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, for the record, might it be noted that Mr. Fry was the only one who was given a copy of this document, and that the Prosecution has never seen this document?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we are going to show you the document so that you can see it in a moment. 

Madam Witness, this identification sheet which you have before you, I would like you to look at it and have you verify or confirm for us that the information contained in it is correct.  If there are any mistakes, kindly make the necessary amendment. 
THE WITNESS:
Everything is correct.  There is no mistake on the document. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Monthé, you have the floor.  Can you confirm from the witness that the document is correct and it would seem that that is the case because she has just signed the document? 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
I am seeing that she is talking to the registry.  I don't know whether there is a problem. 
THE WITNESS:
No, there is no problem. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Very well. 

Madam President, Your Honours, for the trial purposes I would wish that you keep -- that you admit this Defence Exhibit D.  43, if my numbering is correct. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I see Mr. Fry nodding, so that must be correct.

MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you have objection to the admission of this document, Madam Prosecutor?  
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, we would have two comments; one, we would like to see the signed document; and, two, we would ask the Defence counsel if, perhaps, as we did when we had our witnesses, if perhaps he can make available to us a copy.  It wastes court time for us to have to note down the contents. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Monthé?  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
A copy of this document will be given to the Prosecution.  It is a problem of management, it would seem. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, this document is, therefore, admitted as exhibit -- as a Defence exhibit.  And the reference to it will be D. 43, and it shall be placed under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 43 admitted, under seal) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you have the floor.  And, obviously, the Prosecution will be given a copy of this document later on. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Very well, Madam President.
WITNESS BZ3,
first having been duly sworn, 
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness BZ3.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.  
Q.	Thank you for having come all of the way to make your own contribution to justice.  I'm going to ask you a few questions on behalf of the Defence.  And I'm asking you to answer calmly.  If, by chance, you do not understand any question, please let me know so that I can reformulate my question.  Are you ready? 
A.	Yes, I am ready. 
Q.	Let me say, finally, that you are a protected witness.  If, for instance, any of my questions may reveal your identity, naturally you will not respond, but I shall endeavour not to get to that. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
You yourself should be careful in order not to reveal your identity, not to provide any information which is likely to reveal your identity.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness BZ3, can you tell the Chamber where you were in April 1994, without giving any particulars -- particular details, just simply where you were? 
A.	I was in Nyange, in Kivumu commune. 
Q.	Thank you.  Tell me now, in Nyange during that period of time, in other words, April, if there were any events that took place there; do you remember? 
A.	Yes, I remember the events that happened there. 
Q.	Could you please tell the Chamber, according to you, what was the nature of those events and when did they begin? 
A.	As for those events, they were killings which were committed following the death of                    President Habyarimana, Juvénal, who was killed in April 1994. 
Q.	Thank you.  For us to go about this chronologically, do you remember exactly the day on which you learned of the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	Yes, I remember that day. 
Q.	Can you tell us on what day you learned of the death of the president? 
A.	I heard the news of the death of the president in the morning of the 7th; in other words, the day after the president died. 
Q.	Thank you.  Under what circumstances did you learn of the death of the president? 
A.	I had a servant who was working for me and he is the one who told me.  He had heard of it from outside, and this was from people who he had met who were speaking about it. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  Now, as you recall, once you heard that news from your servant, what was your reaction and the reaction of the people in your neighbourhood?  Can you tell us a bit about that? 
A.	When I learned of the news and having seen the reaction of other people, I realised that people were afraid.  In fact, we could notice that something had changed in the behaviour of people. 
Q.	Now, when you say something had changed in the behaviour of people, can you be a bit more clear for the benefit of the Chamber, if you please? 
A.	When I say that something had changed after the death of the president, what I mean is people were afraid and people were gathered in groups here and there.  And people were discussing, obviously discussing something.  This is what I observed. 
Q.	Thank you, very much.  Were you able to know what the subject of the conversation was of those people who gathered here and there? 
A.	At any rate, since the news spread, you could hear people talk about it.  But we didn't understand, really, what was being said.  At any rate, it dealt with the president's death. 
Q.	According to you, since everybody was talking about the president's death, were you able to know what would happen after that event or were they talking about something else? 
A.	Personally, I wasn't concerned with the content of the conversations.  But you will understand when a chief of state dies, it is not a normal occurrence.  You could see that the people were afraid, but I didn't know exactly or specifically what they were saying.  You could see people moving here and there.  That is all. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ3.  Did the relationship between people in your community change after the news of the president's death, and if so, when exactly, according to you? 
A.	After Habyarimana's death there was a climate that I have described.  After that, killings started.  People ate the cows of the Tutsis who lived in the country.  That was some of the things that you could see that began to happen. 
Q.	Thank you.  For the purposes of the record, can you tell us, according to you, when did people start eating Tutsis' cows?  When did people start killing others?  We know the president died on the 6th of April.
A.	First, there weren't many Tutsis who lived in the area where I did, but you could see people leaving their homes carrying traditional weapons, like machetes and spears.  I started to see such things in my area beginning on the 11th. 
Q.	Witness BZ3, you say that you saw people who were armed with machetes and spears.  Where were they going?  What were they doing? 
A.	I lived in a house near a path.  And the place -- the area where I lived, I could see people go by that path.  Even some Tutsis went by there; they were fleeing.  Others went to the communal office.  But I can't be specific regarding where exactly they were going, I didn't ask anyone.  But I could see that there were changes.  I didn't have the presence of mind to ask people where they were going or to ask them what they were doing. 
Q.	Thank you.  Can you tell the Chamber if the people who were armed, who you saw passing by, were Hutus or Tutsi? 
A.	The people who passed by who were armed were Hutus. 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, tell me, you told us that the Tutsi had their cattle looted and some of them killed, some of them went to the communal office.  Did they all go to the communal office or did others go elsewhere? 
A.	I talked about the Tutsis who went to the communal office.  Those are the ones I saw go in front of my house; that was on a Monday.  In the morning I went to mass, I saw other people who had taken refuge.  I'm talking about when I went to church in the morning.  Regarding the people who went to the communal office, they didn't remain there long.  They started to move towards the church after that. 
Q.	When you mention a church, you are talking about Nyange church, aren't you?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	It is the Nyange Catholic church? 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Were you a regular at that church?  Were you a parishioner there? 
A.	Yes, that was my church.  I went there on a regular basis.  I went each morning for mass, went there all of the time. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  For the benefit of the Chamber, tell us, when you went to that church, do you remember the name of the priest who was there in April 1994?  What was his name? 
A.	The priest was called Father Stratton. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did you have any particular relationship with Father Stratton, or did you know him? 
A.	Yes, I knew him as the priest of our parish.  He gave mass at our parish; that is how I knew him. 
Q.	Thank you.  And beside Father Stratton, were there any other priests at the parish who worked with Father Stratton; was there anyone else? 
A.	The other priest who was there was Father Seromba. 
Q.	Thank you.  Since you were a believer from that church, did it ever occur that you would meet with Father Seromba? 
A.	Perhaps after mass, believers would greet the priest; that is how sometimes I would greet the priests and then I would just go home. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, do you remember, and if so, tell us, for how long Father Seromba had been at Nyange parish when you met him?  Had he been there for a long while or for a short while? 
A.	To the best of my recollection, Father Seromba had not been there for very long. 
Q.	Thank you.  You say for not very long.  Does that mean two weeks, three, six months, a year?  Can you be more specific for the Chamber; this, of course, in your own opinion, if you know? 
A.	I don't remember the exact date when he arrived to that place.  I believe he arrived towards the end of 1993. 
Q.	Thank you.  You were a believer from that church.  Can you tell us what did the parishioners like you think of Father Seromba? 
A.	I was a believer who went to that church to pray.  I could see that Father Seromba gave mass.  He communicated the message to the parishioners and they -- the believers were satisfied with it. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ3.  Let us now get back to what you said earlier.  You were talking about the movement of people towards the parish.  According to you, there were Tutsis who were going to the parish.  Do you remember when they started to go to the parish?  You said that you saw them going by.  When did you see them arrive while you were at mass? 
A.	As I said already, I found some Tutsi at the church in the morning.  On the morning of the 11th I went to church for mass.  That means that the people who were there had arrived the night before.  I found them there in the morning when I went for mass. 
Q.	Thank you for those clarifications.  Witness, please tell us, and please tell the Chamber, you found those Tutsis there on the 11th.  In which state were they, were they -- did it look like they were mistreated?  How did they look? 
A.	In fact, I saw them during the morning mass, but I could see that they were refugees.  They didn`t have many resources.  I wasn't able to talk with them, but I could see that they were refugees and they had come to the church.  I didn't wonder about them.  Only later when I went back home did everyone know that the Tutsis were fleeing towards the church. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Tell me, did you know why the Tutsi were fleeing to the church; were you aware of the reasons?  Did you speak about the situation with anyone else around you? 
A.	The Tutsis were fleeing because Hutus were burning down their houses.  They had to leave their houses, and they had to flee. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You saw them on the 11th at the church.  Were there many of them? 
A.	No.  When I saw them on the 11th, there were not many of them.  This was in the morning when I went to church for mass, there were not many Tutsi at that time on the 11th. 
(Pages 24 to 33 by Donna M. Lewis)



























1715H 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You saw them on the 11th.  You did you see Father Seromba on the same day? 
A.	Yes, I saw him on the 11th.  He gave Mass.
Q.	Did he refer to the presence of the refugees in question during his Mass? 
A.	What I remember is that at the end of Mass, he spoke to the Believers.  He said that there were people who had taken refuge at the parish. They didn't have any recourse, any supplies.  He urged the Christians to try to assist them by bringing them clothing or supplies or things they clearly needed. 
Q.	Thank you, very much.  You saw the refugees at the parish.  Where exactly were they?  Were they inside the church, outside the church or were they at the presbytery or were they somewhere else within the parish compound? 
A.	I told you I went to Mass.  I found them inside the church.  They were at Mass.  When Mass was given they were there with us as Christians. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  According to you, Father Seromba asked the parishioners to help the refugees.  Did they heed the call? 
A.	In fact, when I went home, I was not able to return for Mass.  The situation changed.   So, I don't know. What I do know is that there were some nuns who were trying to provide supplies to the refugees at the church.  That I know, otherwise, I do not know whether the parishioners heeded the call from 
	Father Seromba. 
Q.	Thank you, very much.  So, Witness, tell us; you said you weren't able to return to church, why is that? 
A.	On that day which was the 11th, when I returned home, I could see some refugees going to the communal office from our area.  When they arrived there, they were directed towards the church.  It was difficult to move around.  You could see that it was difficult.  We were afraid to move around in those circumstances. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  Witness, if you have an answer to this question that would be great.  I think the Chamber would like to know why would they direct - - why were those people directed towards the church and who was telling them to go there? 
A.	You mean when they arrived at the commune office? 
Q.	Let me rephrase my question for you:  
MR. MONTHÉ:  
	Is it an objection, Madam President?  I don't hear. 
MS. ALEXIS: 
No other reason for me to be on my feet Mr. Monthé.  My apologies.  It is an objection.  Perhaps I didn't state it clearly.  The question being asked, Madam President, Your Honours, we could not have been prepared for these particulars since having regard to your statement, it would have been clear to us that this witness would not have had an answer to that particular aspect and in this regard, I am objecting to this line of questioning since I was given the distinct impression in the statements that this witness will not be given - - will not be given such evidence. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, Your Honours, honestly I do not understand.  I don't understand that objection at all. Perhaps the Chamber should shed light on this, but I don't understand this. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, could you kindly repeat your objection because the Bench also is having difficulty in understanding it. 
MS. ALEXIS: 
	Very well, Madam President, I was allowed to read the statement and that is why I made my objection in the manner that I did.  And I only have with me an unofficial copy of the English document, but even when I read the document in its original French I admit in my less perfect French, it was clear to me that this witness was going to see that she did not know how the refugees organised themselves to go to the parish, and that is why I expressed surprise when the witness was being  asked her opinion as to why the refugees, in fact, when it was clear in the statement that the witness had no information in this regard you so that in our minds, this is a very important aspect and it is in fact on the statement provided, a new element for which we'd prior, no prior notice and that is the basis  of my objection, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We still are not sure whether we understand the objection. 

Counsel, you may proceed.

Madam Prosecutor, right to the question, you have to tell us exactly why that question is inadmissible.

Mr. Monthé, you may continue. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Let me go back to the order of my questioning.  I think that I was taken aback the Chamber might have been as well.  Let me repeat my question which was indeed a very simple one.  Witness, why were the refugees going to the church? 
A.	I don't know why the refugees were going to the church. 
Q.	Thank you.  So according to you, on the 11th you went home?  Up to that date, did you have any information about what happened at the church? 
A.	As I told you, I left the church.  After that, I continued to see refugees going there.  I can't tell you that they were walking there or otherwise, I just know that they were going from the communal office to the church.  Late on, the refugees at the church were hunted down by some people who wanted to kill them. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness with your permission, I want you to go back to something.  You said that there were some nuns who helped to supply and feed the refugees who were at the church; is that correct? 
A.	I didn't say that I saw that with my own eyes.  I did hear people say that the nuns were trying to give supplies to the refugees, but since there were some attacks here and there, it is possible the nuns were unable to get the supplies to the refugees in question. 
Q.	Thank you.  In the same manner, tell me, did you ever hear that Father Seromba mistreated any of the refugees who were at the church? 
A.	Frankly speaking, I never heard that Father Seromba mistreated any of the refugees who were at the church.  If at all he had done anything bad to the refugees, if he asked that they be given supplies or food, it wouldn't seem logical that it would have done anything bad to them.  So it seems inconceivable that he mistreated any of refugees. 
Q.	Thank you.  Tell me, Witness, before refugees arrived at the church, what did the parishioners from that parish think about Father Seromba?  Did people have problems with him in your parish?  Did you hear anything like that? 
MS. ALEXIS: 
Hasn't this question been asked and already answered?  I believe that it was already - - indeed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Counsel. 
MR. MONTHÉ:  
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness BZ3, before the arrival of many refugees at the church in Nyange, did you ever find out whether Father Seromba had any disagreements with anyone in your neighborhood?  That is my question to you. 
A.	Quite frankly speaking, since his arrival at your parish, I never heard it mentioned or said that he had had any disagreement with anyone.  For example, if he said Mass, people would be able to boycott the Mass and they would not go to church, but that never was the case. 
Q.	Tell me, after the 11th, did you have the opportunity to see Father Seromba in your neighborhood again? 
A.	I think I saw him again only once after the 11th, and he was on a motor cycle. 
Q.	Thank you.  When did you get to know what was happening at the parish?  After the 11th, did you get to know about the situation of the refugees who were there? 
A.	I knew that the war was ongoing because I could see people going to the parish and the aim was to kill those people who had found refuge at the church. 
Q.	Thank you.  According to you, these people who were going to the church, what were they referred to as? 
A.	They were Hutus who were going to the church in order to kill the Tutsis.  So, it was members of the Hutu ethnic group who were killing members of the Tutsi ethnic group. 
Q.	These people that you were seeing passing by, did they live in your neighbourhood or did they come from elsewhere? 
A.	I did not know where the people I was seeing were coming from.  They were many in number, however, there were some attacks which took place, and it was said that the people came from Kabikiliriwa.
Q.	For you testimony to be clear and presuming that Kibilira is far from your neighborhood, did these people come on foot. 
A.	There was not a great distance.  The people from Kibilira could come to our locality and people from my neighborhood would be able to do the same. 
Q.	Thank you, very much.  On the people who were passing, would you have been able to say they had any particular relationship with Father Seromba? 
A.	There was no relationship between them.  Furthermore, Father Seromba wasn't a native of our area and he hadn't spent much time there.  So, there was no relationship between the priest and these people. 
Q.	Thank you for the clarification.  Can you please tell the Chamber whether you were able to know names of people who may have died at the parish during the attacks you referred to and, if yes, on how many days did that happen? 
A.	There were many people at the parish and I cannot claim that I was able to name, the names of people who died at the parish, but there was one person who was very well-known in our area, in the neighborhood and this was a man known as********.
Q. 	Thank you very much. Could you please tell the Chamber if you know who this man ******* was and under what circumstances did he meet his death? 
A.	****************************. 
MS. ALEXIS: 
Your Honours, once again I must object, and this time I will be very particular.  The statement expressly says that I cannot see in what circumstances Gatare died.  In your view, therefore, this particular question is not a proper one. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, Madam President, I would like to make an objection in my term.  The practice of your Chamber requires that witness statements constitute what the witness is going to say in person, and what you will consider as priority would be what the witness says in Court.   I have read the jurisprudence and this is my opinion.  Madam President, I am reading in the statement of 
4th December 2004 at paragraph 6.  This is what the witness says, "No, I did not learn that 
Father Seromba had Gatare killed. All I know is that he died at the church."
I do accept that there can be an objection, but I shouldn't be stopped at all times. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Counsel. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q. Madam Witness, I am now going to give you a few names of people that you may know from your neighborhood.  If you know them, or you do not, simply answer yes or no.  Do you know one 
******************?   
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
	Could you please wait?  I would like to assure myself that these are not protected witnesses. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
No, no.  I would not have dared to do such a thing, Madam President.  I know that I am bearing all the sins of Israel, but I wouldn't dare to go as far as that. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Madam Witness, does that name ring a bell? 
A.	I know that person. 
Q.	Did you meet the person at the time? 
A.	I didn't meet him. 
Q.	*****************, does that name ring a bell? 
A.	I know the person. 
Q.	Do you have any details about that person? 
A.	All I know about him is that he was CID officer. 
Q.	Does the name (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) mean anything to you? 
A.	I know (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).  He was the assistant of the bourgmestre. 
MS. ALEXIS: 
Madam President, I have an objection and Madam, it's not really an objection, it's a comment and perhaps it should be made in closed session, very very short comment, please, Madam President.  It concerns the names that were just given by the witness which perhaps - - and I am trying to speak in coded language which perhaps for reasons of protection ought not to be mentioned in open session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No objection.  Mr. Monthé, you think that there is a problem? 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Yes, Madam President, and I believe we can indeed go into a short closed session on this matter because I do believe I may have erred somewhat. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are now going to move into closed session.  Can you please do the need for - - and then the Prosecution will be able tell us what her concern is because it would seem this has something to do with protection of witnesses.  We do apologise to the public gallery, but this should not last very long.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [page 40] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera) 
(Pages 34 to 39 by Petrus Chijarira)































MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, thank you.  So we are now in public and open session. 

Mr. Monthé, you may continue with your examination-in- chief. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
	Witness BZ3; let's come back to the refugees.  You stated that you would see people passing by and these Hutus who were armed, and they were going towards the church in order to go and attack the Hutus later, the refugees there.  Are you aware whether the latter, the refugees defended themselves? 
MADAM PRESIDENT 
	Your microphone, please, Madam Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
What I know is that during that period of time at the very beginning of the attacks, the Tutsis who were in the church defended themselves by throwing stones at the attackers. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Did you get to know whether there were several attacks and on which days those attacks took place if you were able to know? 
A.	I cannot claim that there were many attacks. It was the same people who were going to the church, but I am ready to say that I saw people who were said to have come from Kibilira, but to say that there were many attacks, I wouldn't be able to say much about that. 
Q.	And these people, who according to you were going towards the church, were they only going there to attack and kill the Tutsis or were they going there to do anything else?  Did you get to know about that? 
A.	In my view, the attackers were going to the church to kill the people 
Q.	Did you get to know at any point in time whether these people attacked refugees who were outside the buildings? 
A.	I didn't quite understand your question, Counsel. 
Q.	I am going to reformulate it.  I wanted to ask you whether the attackers also attacked buildings at the parish apart from the people that they were attacking. 
A.	What I know is that the Tutsis who were in the church were killed, I knew that the Tutsis were in the church and I know everything else. 
Q.	Did the attackers try to remove the Tutsis from inside the church? 
A.	I don't know what happened at the church or the means used to kill the Tutsis.  All I know is that the Tutsis were killed because during the period in question, I did not walk about so I do not know very much about what happened until today. 
Q.	Tell me what became of the church? 
A.	I know that the church was destroyed, was demolished. 
Q.	Did you get to know how it was demolished? 
A.	I know that it was a bulldozer which was used to demolish the church 
Q.	Were you able to know whether the church was destroyed following instructions issued by someone? 
A.	I do not know anyone who could have given the orders for the church to be demolished. 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness BZ3, I want to ask you some questions before we conclude:  You were living in that area.  Can you tell the Chamber if in your opinion you heard it said that Father Seromba was able to kill or had people killed, people from the neighborhood?  Did you ever hear of that? 
MS. ALEXIS: 
Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor. 
MS. ALEXIS:  
	Might I lodge an objection?  This witness has been asked about her person.   This is a factual witness and it is our view that she might not be asked a question that would elicit an answer as to her opinion. She maybe asked what she saw, what she did and what she heard, she is not an expert witness and that is, Madam President, I find myself to object to this question and the way in which it was raised. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Monthé, can you reformulate your question? 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
	The question that I put is that; did she hear it said that Father Seromba killed or had killed people.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I thought that you were addressing me. Very well, was the question; did you hear it said, can you answer that question, Madam Witness, if you were being asked if you had heard it said. 
THE WITNESS:
As far as I am concerned, I never heard people say that he killed or had people killed.   I remember that after these events he said Mass and he warned the faithful, and he said that consequences of what happened were going to be heavy.  He said that these were horrible and ignoble acts.  According to what I heard, he did not kill or had anything killed.  And there was no mention of it. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Thank you, Witness BV3.  I now want to go to your last question:  When was the last time you saw Father Seromba?  For how long have you not seen him? 
A.	Since we fled, I didn't see him again. 
Q.	1f you were to see him again, would you recognise him? 
A.	I cannot fail to identify my priest.  He said Mass which I myself attended as a Christian.  So I can therefore not fail to be able to identify him 
Q.	can you for the record, and for the Chamber look around the courtroom and tell us where 
	Father Seromba is if he indeed is in this courtroom. 
A.	I have seen him.  He is sitting over there. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
	Madam President, can it be noted by the Chamber that the witness has said Father Seromba is here and that he is sitting there. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Maybe you can ask the witness to be a bit more clear. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
	 I am going to do so. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Can you tell us as required by the Presiding Judge, to tell us exactly where he is exactly seated? 
A.	He is sitting to the left of the Defence Counsel. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, is that satisfactory to the Chamber?  We can ask for further clarification if the Chamber so desires. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is a little difficult, but since you are speaking about counsel who is questioning you, is that what you are saying because there are two of them over there, even three. 
THE WITNESS:
It's the Defence counsel who is asking me questions. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	Very well.  May the record so reflect that the witness has recognised Father Seromba in the courtroom? 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
	Madam President, I have come to the end of my examination-in-chief of Witness BZ3 and the witness is now available for cross-examination.  I was going to forget that the witness who has taken time to come to testify needs to be thanked by the Defence. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Counsel.  

I am now turning to the Prosecution, would you be able to cross examines this witness tomorrow? 
MS. ALEXIS: 
Madam President, the position remains as it was, and Court has ruled.  And we are obliged to follow that ruling of the Court.  If the Defence were to oblige us with the statements, they have been ordered by this Court on several occasions, then the Prosecutor would do everything in his power to ensure that we are ready.  As it is, Madam President, we are disadvantaged because at this juncture, we do not know what is the whole case that the Defence is presenting since contrary to what Your Lordships have ruled, we do not know is the content or as a matter of fact, we don't have the other statements so that our position remains as our senior trail attorney had indicated to this Court before the witness was led in examination-in-chief. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
	We have already asked the Defence to disclose all of the unredacted statements.  I believe that is clear and nobody doubts the meaning of that order, surely, not Mr. Monthé. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, I remember what Professor Guichaoua said; he said they speak and speak until they have nothing to say.  I have nothing to say to that Madam President. 
MS. ALEXIS: 
	Madam President, although counsel may think that we speak and we speak and we speak, it is true. We speak and we speak and speak and speak because they disobey, they disobey, they disobey
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, all of the witness statements shall be disclosed to the Prosecutor Justas, Mr. Monthé promised.  That said we don't clearly understand what you said which you said, Madam Prosecutor.  For my part, I understood that since we asked the Defence to disclose immediately the unredacted statement and immediately means today or to tomorrow morning at the latest.  We want to know if you will be in a position to cross-examine the tomorrow because we should begin tomorrow, at 10:00 tomorrow in the morning.

1810H
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, we must be reasonable.  We are talking about the cross-examination of BZ3, of the witness right here before us.  The Prosecution has received all of the unredacted statements for this witness.  There is no reason they should not be able to conduct their cross-examination.  The problem that came up, to be clear, is that we filed a motion because we have difficulties with witnesses in Rwanda.  You've made an order about that.  With regard to this witness, earlier the Prosecutor was reading the statement in English.  I had to talk about that statement.  They already have the statements.  Nothing is prohibiting them from cross-examining this witness.  They are skipping the issue, saying they are not ready for cross-examination.  Everybody for BZ3 has been disclosed.  
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, if I may, it is unfortunate that the Defence counsel has taken this position.  Since had the Defence counsel obeyed the order of the Court and had given us the statements when he was ordered to give us the statements, then we would not have been having this problem.  As for the English statement, about five minutes before Court started, I got the English and it is an uncertified translation.  But the translation department has gone out of their way to try to assist us.  They were not able even to completely finalise it, but to give us only an uncertified translation, for which we were very grateful, but which I got five minutes before.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, you wish to add something?
MS. ALEXIS:
I wish to add very briefly, in order to give some substance to our objection, that the crux of the matter really is this:   The Defence proposes to present before this Trial Chamber 26 witnesses.  We have been given statements for nine.  We, for instance, do not know if the witness who will be witness number 25 or number 20 will give evidence that is similar to the evidence of this witness, and so that it is difficult for us to properly cross-examine this witness when we will be forced to cross-examine the witness in isolation, because we would be cross-examining the witness, albeit, as Mr. Monthé said, having the statement of this witness, but we will be cross-examining this witness without knowing all that the Defence is coming to see, so that we can structure an approach not just to this cross-examination, but to structure our cross-examination, our response to the Defence, and that is the crux of the issue, Madam President, Your Honours.  
JUDGE HÖKBORG:
Madam Prosecutor, I am not quite sure as to what you want, and English is not my language.  I will not speak to you in Swedish, but maybe we can speak more directly.  Is it that you will not cross-examine this witness tomorrow because you are not able to form your own strategy because you don't have the statements from the Defence?  Thank you.  

MS. ALEXIS:
Your Honour, you have understood exactly what I was saying, so that I was suggesting that perhaps, if we have other witnesses, because we would be loathe to do anything to stop this case or to delay these proceedings.  So if we can continue and, in the meantime, we would make efforts to read all of the statements and get ourselves ready as quickly as we can, given the circumstances.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We are going to do the following:   Tomorrow we shall hear the second witness on the list, BZ14.  After that there's a public holiday.  During that time the Prosecution will have time to prepare.  By that time they will have all of the statements, either this evening or tomorrow morning before the hearing.  This will allow us to proceed normally with examination in-chief, cross-examination, and re-examination of the witnesses, so that we do not have to proceed in the manner we are now.  This presupposes that all of the witness statements must be disclosed to the Prosecution this evening, or tomorrow morning at the latest, and if disclosed tomorrow, before the hearing at 10.30 in the morning.  

If there are no other matters that need to be addressed, we will adjourn, and we will start tomorrow at 10.30 in the morning.
MR. MONTHÉ:
I have a question, Madam President, with regard to the scheduling order for our hearings.  We believe that the Defence were told that we would only have hearings in the afternoon, but we have seen that there was a change in the order.  That makes it difficult for us to plan our work.  Could we kindly have a definitive calendar for the rest of the proceedings?  We had planned to work during the afternoons, but now we will be sitting at difficult times in the mornings.  We are not clear whether or not we will be working all day long or just in the afternoons.  We simply want to know.  Believe us, Madam President, Your Honours, we do have many issues to deal with. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you, yourself, proposed that we sit all day.  Now that we have a courtroom that's available, you are complaining about the fact that we're sitting all day.  It's in each and every one of us, our interests.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
I simply want to be clear. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I've asked Mr. Gogo what exactly the schedule will be.  The schedule was established after the courtroom became available.  We all found out today that we will be able to sit tomorrow.  We ask that everyone be available, and I remind you that you insisted that we sit both morning and afternoon.  Now, if there are any changes, we will inform the parties in due course.  We will inform the registry, and we have asked that we be told what courtrooms are available in a sufficient time so that we can schedule our hearings.  Thank you to all the parties.  Thank you to the interpreters and to the other court staff who have planned on finishing at 6 pm but went on past that.  Thank you all.  These proceedings are adjourned.
