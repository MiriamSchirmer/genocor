MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are called to order. 

Good afternoon, Ladies and Gentlemen.  We are going to continue with the cross-examination of this witness.  

Madam Prosecutor, are you prepared to proceed?  
MS. ALEXIS: 
I am sorry, Madam President.  My handset was not working.  I am ready to proceed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Very well, you have the floor.  You may proceed with your cross-examination of the witness. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MS. ALEXIS: 
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness. 
A.	Good afternoon. 
Q.	Witness, when the - - well - - when the events at Nyange were taking place, did you speak to your husband - - don't mention your husband's name, but did you speak to your husband about the events? 
A.	Yes, we talked about it.
Q.	And you gave evidence yesterday, Witness, that you spoke to someone for less than five minutes at the Codekoki about these events; isn't that true, Witness? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	Aside from this person to whom you spoke for less than five minutes and your husband whilst the events were taking place, did you speak to anyone else? 
A.	I didn't speak about it to anyone else outside my household.  I only spoke with my husband and the other person when he was at the house.  He was 16 years old. 
Q.	Am I to understand, Witness, that apart from your husband, and yourself and your children, that at your household in April 1994, there was another person? 
A.	There was a young girl who lived at the house.
Q.	Witness, I started asking you a question yesterday and then I did not continue.  I would, therefore, ask you, Witness - - I am sorry - - I would, therefore, suggest to you, Witness, that you cannot assist this Court as to whether Athanase Seromba was a member of the Kivumu security council;  isn't that so, Witness?  
A.	I did not know anything. It was a new priest who had just arrived.  I do not know he was part of the security council, I have no idea. 
Q.	Therefore, Witness, coming from your answer, you would, of course, agree with me that you have no idea what decisions were made at that Kivumu security council; isn't that so, Witness? 
A.	You are correct, I have no idea. 
Q.	Therefore, Witness, if I suggest to you that there were meetings of the Kivumu security council on the 10th and the 11th of April in which the authorities planned the events at Nyange church, you would not be able to assist; isn't that so, Witness? 
A.	I don't know. 
Q.	So, Witness, in response to counsel for Athanase Seromba, when you said that the events at Nyange were not planned, you were simply giving the Court your opinion; weren't you? 
A.	According to what I was told, I could see that there was disorder in what was going on.  In my opinion, the events were not planned, therefore. 
Q.	Witness, would you agree with me that the roadblocks that were set up in your commune after the death of the president were set up to catch and kill Tutsis? 
A.	The purpose of those roadblocks was to control RPF elements who had spread throughout the country and committed criminal acts and sowed chaos throughout the country. 
Q.	Witness, when you say RPF elements, are you referring to Tutsis in your commune? 
A.	There was a mix; there were Tutsis and Hutus and even foreigners amongst the RPF element. 
Q.	Witness, can you confirm that you said that you knew Fulgence Kayishema, but you did not see him at the time of the events? 
A.	Yes, I confirm that I know him, but I did not see him during the events. 
Q.	Even if you did not see him, Witness, would you agree with me that he was considered to be one of the leaders of the attackers at the church? 
A.	I have no idea.  I do know that he was a criminal investigations officer in Kivumu commune.  That's what I know.
Q.	Similarly, Witness, you gave evidence that you knew Télephore Ndungutse, but you did not see him at the time; is that so, Witness? 
A.	That's correct.
Q.	However, Witnesses, would you agree with me that this Télephore Ndungutse was considered to be one of the leaders of the attackers at the church in April 1994? 
A.	I have no evidence of that, no evidence according to which he was the leader of the attacks, but I did know him before the events that I can confirm. 
Q.	Witness, isn't it true that during the events of April 1994 at Nyange, that your husband went out of the house every day and that you did not  know where he went sometimes and sometimes he did not come home until night, would you agree with that proposition? 
A.	Just like during the other days, when he had the time, he would go out and he would come back when he wanted to.  However, he would not come home at night.  It was unsafe at night.  He would come home early. 
Q.	Witness, did you ever say to anyone that sometimes your husband did not come home till in the night? 

MR. MONTHÉ: 
Objection, Madam President.  The witness indicated that he came home early.  He never spoke about nightfall. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, do you have any response to Mr. Monthe's objection.
MR. ALEXIS: 
Madam President, I would rephrase for now.  
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, perhaps, I should be more specific.  At any time, well, before I intended that line, let me ask you a few questions:  Before you came here to give evidence, isn't it true that you gave statements to the Defence investigators of the Accused Athanase Seromba?
A.	That's correct, I made a written statement.  
Q.	Did you sign that statement? 
A.	Yes, I signed that statement with my own hand.
Q.	Witness, if I suggest to you that you said to the investigators on the 9th of March 2005, that sometimes your husband would not come home till in the night; what would you say to this proposition? 
A.	Perhaps you should be more specific with regard to which time, otherwise, it wasn't past 6 p.m.  It was unsafe, everyone trying to come home early, to return home early himself.  He would come home early, not during the night. 
Q.	Witness, my apologies, I don't quite understand your response.  Are you agreeing with me or not?  Did you or did not tell the investigators in your statement of the 9th of March 2005 that sometimes your husband would not come home till in the night? 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, I raise an objection.  In the statement mentioned, this witness says that sometimes her husband returned in the evening.  Now, the Prosecutor is mentioning the night which does not correspond to the same thing, absolutely not, especially for us Africans.  When we Africans speak of the night and evening it's very different.  The witness has said that sometimes her husband returned in the evening and that is the question that should be put to her, not the night. 
MS. ALEXIS:  
Madam President, I have been looking for the French version so I can compare it.  But in any event, counsel should not give evidence from the Bar telling us about him, according to him, "We Africans take the evening and the night to be."  That is for the witness to say and not at all counsel.  However, that being said, I have finally found the French version and it is true that there is a difference between the English version and the English (sic) version.  And being handicapped, I was indeed looking at the 
English version, the English version has in the night and that is why I was putting it to her in the night.  The French version says, "Le soir" which very well can be interpreted as the evening. 

MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, should we - - therefore, did you start the question, it's not admitted because that is of interest because in the question of the Prosecutor she mentioned the night and if the question is not admitted, and then that needs to be determined. 
MS. ALEXIS:  
Madam President, I will not trouble Your Lordships on this issue, I will simply move on. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Madam Prosecutor. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Obliged, Madam President.  
BY MS. ALEXIS: 
Q.	Witness, isn't it true that during the events of April 1994 when your husband left the house, that you did not go with him? 
A.	That is true.  I would remain at home and he would leave. 
Q.	When you went to that place near to the church, on the day it was being destroyed, you were not paying any special attention to looking for authorities; isn't that true, Witness? 
A.	What was of concern to me was the medication for my child.  I didn't take due note to determine whether there were any authorities or not.
Q.	When you arrived at that place near to the church, was the church being destroyed or had it already been destroyed? 
A.	The church had not yet been destroyed. 
Q.	When you arrived, did you see a bulldozer at the church? 
A.	Maybe the bulldozer was there, but I didn't see it.  It's possible that the bulldozer was on the other side where there were many people who may have blocked my view. 
Q.	Witness, when you arrived at the church, the church had not yet been destroyed at all, is that your evidence?  They had not yet begun to destroy the church; is that your evidence? 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Objection, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, proceed. 
MR. MONTHÉ:  
Madam President, the witness never said that she arrived at the church.  She said, and that's consistent, that she reached Codekoki and the pharmacy to buy medicine but that pharmacy was close to the church, but not she never got to the church itself.  The Prosecutor should be more specific in her questions. 
MS. ALEXIS:  
Very well, Madam President, least I include also the Defence, I will rephrase my question. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:  
Q.	Yes, madam is it your evidence that when you arrived near the church that they had not even begun to destroy it; is that your evidence? 
A.	Maybe they had begun demolishing the church because there were some places which were destroyed using small hoes and other objects were used to demolish the church, but when I arrived the church had not been completely destroyed.
Q.	When you mentioned, Witness, that they had used hoes, smaller hoes to destroy the church, did you actually see this with your own eyes? 
A.	That was what I was told. 
Q.	When you arrived at that place near to the church, is it true, Witness, that you never walked towards the church until you were close to the church; isn't that so? 
A.	I did not approach the church.  When I reached there, and realised the situation that was prevailing, I didn't even buy the medicine that I had come to buy. I turned around and I spoke to someone whose name I did not know, and then I went back home because I had sick child.  Moreover, I told you that I was living with another child in the house and that child was Tutsi, and I could not abandon that child for a long time in the house.
Q.	Very well, Witness, from where you were standing at that place, at the church, would you agree with me that you were able to see that there were hundreds of attackers around the church. 
A.	Yes, I could see the crowd of people. 
Q.	Witness, if I suggest to you that on the day the church was being destroyed, that is, on the 
	16th of April 1994, that Athanase Seromba was present at the church premises, you would not be in a position to say anything; isn't that so, Witness? 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, objection.  That's not the question because the witness cannot response to that assertion being made.  The witness cannot be told, "If I were to put it to you," you cannot -- the witness can not respond because that is not a question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What do you say to that objection raised, Madam Prosecutor? 
MS. ALEXIS:  
Madam President, perhaps counsel disagreed with my formulation of the question and I apologise.  It was a very purely sort of common-law formulation, but the essence of the formulation was that it was a proposition, a proposition which arose straight out of the case for the Prosecutor which in fact I am putting to the witness. 

Perhaps, if it would cause less contention, I can put the same proposition, but rephrase the terminology so that it would be more acceptable to all. 

JUDGE HÖKBORG:
Madam Prosecutor, please, it might be that you are very well acquainted with the way that you ask questions in your system,  but for us also it is sometimes,  at least for me, a little difficult and also in this courtroom, it needs to be translated first into French and then into Kinyarwanda.  So, I would also prefer maybe a bit more straight questions.  

Thank you. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Thank you very much for that guidance, Judge.  I would certainly rephrase my questions accordingly.  

May I continue, Madam President? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may.  You may proceed, Madam Prosecutor, now that we have told you - - Judge Hökborg has told you what she feels, you may proceed. 
MS. ALEXIS: 
Thank you. 
BY MS. ALEXIS: 
Q.	Witness, I put it to you that on the 16th of April 1994, when that church was being destroyed, 
	Athanase Seromba was present at the church.  What do you say to that proposition? 
A.	That is simple to solve.  He is here.  I cannot respond in his steed.  I wasn't close to that place for me to be able to see what I saw there, but fortunately, he is present and he may respond. 
Q.	Witness, I am very sorry, I cannot question Mr. Seromba at this point, I am questioning you.  So, if you can assist us then please do so.  I am also putting it to you, Witness, that on the 16th of April, 1994, Athanase Seromba gave his permission for the church to be destroyed.  What do you say to that proposition? 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Monthé. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I raise an objection. I believe that in this Tribunal we use to distinct common law system and the civil law which we hail from.  And this kind of question cannot be answered by the witness because she does not understand.  You should not be making propositions. You should be putting simple questions to the witness as has been said by Judge Hökborg.  Now, the witness obviously doesn't understand this proposition you are making to her.  So I am asking the officers of the Prosecutor to put direct questions to the witness so that she can answer in a direct manner. 

MS. ALEXIS:  
Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor, we have asked you to ask direct questions because this may be a bit difficult for the witness to understand.  She may not be able to understand your line of questioning because you are trying to present to her the case of the Prosecution, but can you ask her direct questions so she can understand exactly what she needs to give you as an answer because she has said that she did not see Father Seromba on the site and so try and be more direct so that the witness can answer your questions, otherwise, she will give you answers which will not be satisfactory to you nor to the Chamber possibly. 
MS. ALEXIS: 
Actually, I have been making efforts to be direct and I must apologise to the Court if, in fact, my efforts fell short of the mark. I will not repeat the -- well; I will just repeat that last question and try again to put it as briefly and as directly as possible. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:   
Q.	Witness, Witness, isn't it true that you do not know if Athanase Seromba gave his permission to destroy the church on the 16th of April 1994? 
A.	I don't know. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, I now come to a part of the evidence which, out of an abundance of caution, will best be led in closed session.  So it's to do with questions that deal particularly without saying more, with the spouse, and I don't want to jeorpadise the security of this witness.  So I try as I can, 
Madam President, can we, if it so pleases the Court, go into closed session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, can we be told whether these would be your last questions to the witness? 
MS. ALEXIS: 
Yes, please, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Mr. Monthé any objection from you?  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, the Defence has no objection to the manifestation of the truth. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We shall move to a closed session now, and this is in order to ensure the protection of this witness. And also in the interest of justice, we do apologise to the general public present in the gallery
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 8 to 12 was extracted and sealed under separate cover as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 1 to 7 by Petrus Chijarira) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We are now in open session.  You can now proceed with the questions as we wait for the Registry?  

Registry, have you found two exhibits?  
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Yes, might the witness now be shown 3 -12 in your evidence, Witness?  You said that you were at the Codekoki.   Do you see the Codekoki on that photograph? 
A.	Yes, I can see the Codekoki on this photograph.  
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, I have a photocopy, I will just get it so that it can be marked and if you will give me one moment.  I released that it would be impossible to mark the court exhibit.  So, this if all parties agree is a photocopy of the particular photograph. 
(Page 13 by Petrus Chijarira)
























1530H 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Using this copy, can you mark for the Court where you were standing when you stood for less than five minutes, near the Codekoki, near the church?  Witness, have you been able to locate for this Court where you were standing, where you said you were for less than five minutes?  Have you marked the spot, Witness?  
A.	Yes. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, Your Honours, might this photocopy of Prosecution Exhibit 3-12 be marked as Prosecution Exhibit -- and for this I would have to ask the assistance of the registry. 
MR. FRY:
P. 28, Your Honour. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Thank you, Registry.

Might I now be shown the Exhibit P. 28, please?  

And may the witness now be shown what was Prosecution Exhibit 3-21?  
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, do you have that photograph before you? 
A.	Yes, I have the photograph here. 
Q.	And do you agree that that is the Nyange church that you attended before it was destroyed? 
A.	Yes, I clearly see that that was the church. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, Your Honours, those are all of my questions for this witness. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, I would like to inform the Chamber that I did not hear whether they were admitted, these exhibits.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I believe the Prosecution would want us to inform it what the references are.  Are you tendering both for exhibit or only the first, Madam Prosecutor?  
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, both were already entered into evidence.  The reason I asked for a photocopy of the first one to be entered into evidence was that it was not possible for her to mark the actual exhibit.  But as for the second one, we would be pleased if the record may state that the witness has identified Prosecution Exhibit 3-21 as Nyange church. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor, but the photocopy with the marked place on it by the witness about the place where she was, do you want to have that tendered as an exhibit?  
MS. ALEXIS:
Yes please, Madam President, I thought I had asked already.  Yes, the registry did tell me that it would be Prosecution Exhibit 28, the photocopy.  So in that case then, might that photocopy which, for the record, is a photocopy of Prosecution Exhibit 3-12 be marked and entered into evidence as  Prosecution Exhibit 28.  Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Now, it is all very clear.

Defence, no objection on your part regarding the admission of this document?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, we have no objection.  Furthermore, these exhibits were already tendered as exhibits, so we have no objection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Therefore, the photocopy of Prosecution Exhibit 3-12, with the marking made on it by the Witness BZ2, is admitted as a Prosecution Exhibit; and it will be marked as P. 28.  So you have concluded with your cross-examination; that's what I understand? 
(Exhibit No. P. 28 admitted) 
MS. ALEXIS:
Yes, please, Madam President.  I have no further questions for this witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor.  

Defence, do you wish to re-examine this witness, Mr. Monthé?  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, Your Honours, the Defence will not have any re-examination of this witness.  And I thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Monthé.

Madam Witness, you have come to the end of your testimony before this Tribunal.  The Judges have no questions to put to you.  And we, therefore, thank you for having come to testify before this Tribunal and for having kindly responded to all of the questions put to you.  We wish you a safe journey home, and we wish your baby a safe and speedy recovery.  

THE WITNESS:
If it is possible I would like to add something, Madam President?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Please proceed. 
THE WITNESS:
Because I am a witness before this Tribunal I would like to say that I am living in a refugee camp where there is a lot of insecurity.  The representative of the refugees has asked for us to leave that camp.  And then I also have two children under my care, and I have no possibility for leaving that place.  I don't know whether the Tribunal can intervene and address the UNFCR, which, in turn, can find me an alternative place of refuge where there would be safety and security for me and my children?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, the Chamber has heard your request.  We will invite Mr. Monthé to formalise that request made by the witness and those who are competent in taking the necessary steps will be able to do something, I believe. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Yes, Madam President.  I believe the WVSS is responsible for this kind of matter, which is a matter of concern to the Defence.  We have worked on it at the end of this morning and we continue to work on it.  And, hopefully, the results will be fruitful and we can assure the witness that we are making efforts. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Monthé.

Madam Witness, please be informed that we are sensitive to the issue that you have just raised.    There -- maybe we shall have the witness leave the courtroom.  And I wonder whether there is not a witness waiting to be heard at the present moment? 

We will continue with the cross-examination from the Prosecutor.  I'm going to ask the Prosecution bench which would be the next witness for you to cross-examine today?  
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, what we proposed was that we go back, after we have finished with this witness, whom we did not want to keep too long since she had personal problems that she had spoke about with her baby and so on, but that being aside, we propose to go back to the order in which the witnesses had been previously called.  So that in that order the next two witnesses would be BZ3, followed by BZ14.  So, if that was pleasing to the Trial Chamber, the next witness that we would like to have heard was BZ3. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We would like to know from the Prosecution whether BZ3 will take us up to the end of today's session, in other words, around 1800 hours or should we need to have BZ14 brought forward also?  
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, I don't propose to be very long with this witness.  I have only a few pages of questions.  I think -- and I'm trying to be very careful, but I think I shall be around one hour or perhaps even shorter.  So it may be best to have another witness in case. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We thank you.  
(Witness enters the courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Witness BZ3. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We remind you that you are still under oath after the examination-in-chief of you by the Defence.  And it is now the turn of the Prosecutor to cross-examine you.  So please, answer questions put to you by the Prosecution this afternoon.

Madam Prosecutor, you have the floor for your cross-examination.  
MS. ALEXIS:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.
WITNESS BZ3
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness? 
A.	Good afternoon. 
Q.	I only have a few questions for you, Witness, and I will start right away.  In 1994 you were only around 16 or 17 years old; do you agree with me? 
A.	Yes, you are right. 
Q.	You spoke about a servant who told you news of the president's death.  This servant was he your servant or was he your brother's servant? 
A.	The person was the employee of my brother. 
Q.	You gave evidence, Witness, that after the 11th of April 1994, that it became difficult to move around; do you remember saying this? 
A.	Yes, I remember.  I did make such a statement. 
Q.	On the next day, the 12th of April 1994, did you go anywhere? 
A.	As I have stated, on that date which you have just mentioned, I was able to go to the church to pray.  Later on I remained at home, but I was able to go and fetch water, but I didn't go anywhere else. 
Q.	Aside from going to fetch water, from April 13th to April 17th did you go anywhere else? 
A.	Frankly speaking, I must tell you that it was a time of war; it was very difficult to move about.  We were afraid of meeting with killers and we couldn't just move about anyhow. 
Q.	So, Witness, when you say people were going to the communal office, you didn't actually see them going to the communal office; is that so? 
A.	I stated that I saw some people.  The refugees were not moving about in view of everyone, they would leave secretly.  And people who had left their homes went to the commune office.  And from where I lived I saw them and they were on board a vehicle. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us who was driving this vehicle, if you recall? 
A.	That vehicle was being driven by one boy known as Jegoma (phonetic). 
Q.	Witness was this a vehicle owned by Aloys Rwamasirabo? 
A.	Yes, it was his vehicle. 
Q.	And Aloys Rwamasirabo was a Tutsi businessman from Kivumu commune; is that so? 
A.	I know that he was a Tutsi and that he had a vehicle.  As far as I am concerned he didn't have a shop, all I know is that he had a vehicle. 
Q.	You gave evidence, Witness, that when the refugees arrived at the communal office that they were directed towards the church?  Who directed the refugees towards the church; do you know, Witness? 
A.	I never said that refugees had been asked to go to the church; rather, what I said was that the refugees reached the commune office and they spent some time there.  Later on they went to the church. 
Q.	At the age you were in April 1994, were you on close terms with any of the communal authorities? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, can the Prosecutor repeat the question for the benefit of the Kinyarwanda booth?  
MS. ALEXIS:
I think I was a bit far from the microphone.  It must be because of my limited height and reach, but I will try my best.  
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, I will repeat my question.  Since you said you were very young in April 1994, do you agree with me that you were not close or good friends with any of the communal authorities? 
A.	I didn't quite understand the meaning of your question. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  Were you -- were you close friends with Fulgence Kayishema? 
A.	Fulgence Kayishema was not my friend.  You have just said yourself my age would not have allowed me to be a friend of Fulgence Kayishema. 
Q.	By your answer, Witness, would you agree with me that you were not friends or close to            Grégoire Ndahimana or Thélesphore Ndungutse? 
A.	You have just said yourself neither of the two men was my friend.  What kind of friend would I be?  
Q.	Witness, do you agree with me that the church was destroyed on the 16th of April 1994? 
A.	It is a long time ago since these events happened and I no longer recall the dates very well.  But I know that, as you have said, it is possible that it was around that date which you yourself mentioned.  But I wouldn't be absolute about that. 
Q.	Before the 16th of April 1994, Kayishema, Ndahimana and Ndungutse met with Athanase Seromba.  Do you know anything about this, Witness? 
A.	I don't know anything about that, this it is the first time I am hearing such things and I never heard anyone say such things about them. 
Q.	When the church was being destroyed were you actually present to see what was going on? 
A.	I believe I have answered that question already.  I told you that after the days that I mentioned to you I went to pray and I never went back to the church again. 
Q.	Witness, therefore, when the church was being destroyed, Athanase Seromba gave his permission to destroy the church.  You don't know anything about this; isn't that true, Witness?  
A.	Rwandans like to say that, "There is no news which remains without being known."  If that had taken place I would have gotten to know.  These must have been lies; they never happened. 
Q.	Witness, this Jegoma (phonetic) that you saw transporting refugees to the communal office, did you see him transporting refugees in that vehicle to -- from the communal office to the church? 
A.	These refugees whom I mentioned to you were not many.  It was only one family.  They were made to flee from their home and they were brought to the commune office.  I told you that they did not spend much time at the commune office.  Later on they went to the church. 
Q.	When they went to the church, Witness, were they transported there by Jegoma (phonetic) in the vehicle of Aloys Rwamasirabo? 
A.	Yes, it was the same vehicle which transported them to the church, and it was Jegoma (phonetic) who was driving that vehicle. 
Q.	Witness, isn't it true that by the time the events of April 1994 started at Nyange church that Father Straton had already left? 
A.	I don't know whether he had left that place or not, but during the events I didn't see him. 
Q.	You said, Witness, can you confirm for us that Athanase Seromba came to Nyange sometime around the end of 1993, do you remember saying that?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Excuse me, maybe the interpretation did not come through; did you say the end of 1994?  
MS. ALEXIS:
No, please, Madam President.  I said 1993, but I will repeat the question in case there is any confusion. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, did you say that Athanase Seromba came to Nyange parish around the end of 1993? 
A.	What I am certain about is that he came towards that year.  However, I cannot be specific as to the date.  I know that he came towards the end of that year. 
Q.	Did you see Athanase Seromba saying mass from the time he first came in 1993 to April 1994? 
A.	Well, obviously he would say mass, he was a priest at the parish, so he couldn't get away without saying mass. 
Q.	And during the time -- this time again, that is from when Athanase Seromba came to Nyange to       April 1994, did he perform wedding ceremonies at Nyange parish church? 
A.	Father Seromba was a priest at Nyange, you see, all of this took place a long time ago.  I wouldn't be able to be precise to tell you whether he said mass during which there was a marriage or a wedding.  However, I must say that as a priest he had the ability to say similar masses. 
Q.	From the end of 1993 to April 1994, did you go to mass every day, Witness? 
A.	I was a student, I couldn't claim that I went there every day, but each time that I had time I would go to mass. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, do you still have quite a few questions for the witness; because if yes, we could take a short break here?  
MS. ALEXIS:
Yes, please, Madam President.  I was not looking at the time; this would be a convenient time for a break. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The session stands adjourned for a few minutes.  
(Court recessed from 1605H to 1625H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are resumed.

Madam Prosecutor, you have the floor to continue with your cross-examination of the witness.  
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam Prosecutor, I just wish to inform the Court that I expect to be finished by 5:00.  So, I'm just putting everyone on notice if, perhaps, it was -- if we will still have enough time to have another witness, I think most probably I will be finished by five. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, when you would go to mass from the end of 1993 to April 1994, was Athanase Seromba quite often the priest who was saying the mass? 
A.	He was not the only priest to say mass; he was not alone at the parish.  He took turns with the other priests. 
Q.	Would you agree with me, Witness, that many of the people in your area were Catholic, maybe even up to 85 percent? 
A.	I can't say anything about the figures.  But there were Catholics and then believers from other denominations. 
Q.	From your understanding, Witness, is it true that most of the population of Kivumu commune was Catholic, more than any other denomination? 
A.	Since I used to go to a Catholic church and therefore did not go to other churches, I'm not in a position to tell you or to give you a satisfactory answer to that question. 
Q.	But can you tell me, Witness, whether according to you amongst the members of Nyange parish church whether Athanase Seromba was a priest who was admired and respected by the population? 
A.	From what I could see as a believer there, there was no problem between Father Seromba and the parishioners; from what I saw there was no problem.  If there had been a problem, people would have said so. 
Q.	Did you hear, Witness, before April 1994 that Father Straton left because of a disagreement with Athanase Seromba? 
A.	I never heard that. 
Q.	More, specifically, Witness, did you hear before April 1994 that Father Straton had given food from Caritas to some Tutsis? 
A.	I heard about supplies from Caritas that were distributed, however I cannot tell you under which circumstances there was such distribution, but I did hear about it.  I did hear about Caritas distribution of supplies. 
Q.	When you went to church on April 11th 1994, was Athanase Seromba the priest who was saying the mass? 
A.	Yes, it was Father Athanase Seromba who said that mass. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us if you recall what time was that mass that you attended on the                     11th of April 1994? 
A.	Mass was in the morning.  It must have been at about 6:45, that was the normal time, at around 6:45. 
Q.	When Athanase Seromba said this mass on the 11th of April 1994, were there already refugees in the church? 
A.	Yes, on that day I met a few refugees who joined us.  They also went to mass on that same very morning. 
Q.	Were you able to see the Nyange church from where you lived? 
A.	Standing from where I lived, you could not see the church.  You could see the general direction of the church but not the church itself. 
Q.	At this mass of 11th of April 1994, according to you Athanase Seromba invited the members of the church to help the refugees; can you confirm that you said that? 
A.	Yes, I confirm that.  That is what I heard personally.  I was a witness to those facts. 
MS. ALEXIS:
My apologies to the interpreters. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	By this date, the 11th of April 1994, the killings had already started on the hills; isn't that so? 
A.	Yes, the killings had begun; but, in fact, what happened was people started to be threatened and their homes were burnt down.  I am not sure you can say that the war had started.  People were fleeing.  They were fleeing because there was a reason; something was behind them fleeing. 
Q.	When you returned to the church, according to you, on the 12th of April 1994, were there many more refugees on that day than there were the day before? 
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, Your Honours, the Defence objects to this question.  This is found nowhere in the statements, the fact that the witness returned after the 11th of April to the church.  The Defence would kindly request the Prosecution, Madam President, to withdraw that question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, do you have a response to that objection or do you wish to simply rephrase it?  
MS. ALEXIS:
I will respond, Madam President.  At the beginning of my cross-examination I, for this reason, specifically asked the witness what days she went to the church.  If my recollection is correct, the witness did say on this day, the 12th of April 1994, she went again to mass.  And it was, thereafter, that she stopped going because of insecurity.  I don't know if I understood wrongly, Madam President, but that is what I heard her saying.  It was within the first ten questions that I asked the witness.

To clear up the issue, perhaps I can just ask the witness again, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, may we proceed?  
MS. ALEXIS:
If it pleases, Madam President, I was merely waiting to see if the Court would permit me to ask the question as proposed, or if it would -- if I were to ask it around the objection of the Learned Counsel?  

Might I proceed in the same fashion in which I was going, Madam President?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let us ask the witness:  When was the last time, Witness, that you went to mass at the church?  Could you kindly ask that question, when was the last time you went to mass at that church?  
MS. ALEXIS:
Thank you, Madam President, I certainly will.  
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, can you answer that question?  In April 1994, before the destruction of the church when was the last date that you attended mass at the Nyange church? 
A.	As I said before, as I said last time, the last day I went to mass was on the 11th.  The 11th was the last time that I went to mass at that church. 
Q.	After that date, the date of the 11th, do you know whether many more refugees went to Nyange church to seek refuge? 
A.	Yes, indeed, after that date it became clear that anyone who was able to get to the church would go there to take refuge. 
Q.	Witness, did you yourself bring any food for the refugees? 
A.	From the day when the priest made a request and after I arrived at home it was clear the situation had changed.  Therefore, I did not have an opportunity to leave home and return to the church because times had become quite difficult. 
Q.	Did you hear, Witness, that between -- sorry, did you hear, Witness, that on the 14th and                  15th of April 1994, that Athanase Seromba had told the gendarmes that, "If any refugees took his bananas, that they should be shot"?  
A.	I never heard that, never. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, there are a few questions that I want to ask that should be asked in closed session in order to ensure the security of this witness.  But I do have some questions to ask -- I do have some questions to ask after that.  If it is convenient to the Court I can ask for the closed session now and ask those questions; but if it is more convenient to the Court I may ask those questions when I am completely finished with closed session.  Would now be a convenient moment, Madam President, or would the Court prefer that I ask for a closed session when I finish all of my questions in open session?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, if you are in a position to finish with the questions that can be put to the witness in open session, we would prefer that and then we could end the cross-examination in closed session. 
MS. ALEXIS:
I thank you, Madam President, I will do that.  
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, your ethnicity -- can I ask you a question about your ethnicity?  You are Hutu, are you not? 
A.	That is correct, I am Hutu. 
Q.	And Athanase Seromba, he is also Hutu, is he not? 
A.	That is a question you can ask him; he is there.   
Q.	Witness, I am asking -- 
A.	I cannot answer that question. 
Q.	Do you know whether Athanase Seromba is Hutu or not?  I am not asking him, I am asking you.  
A.	To my knowledge, he is a Hutu. 
Q.	You hold all priests to be holy men; isn't that true, Witness? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  That is my personal conviction. 
Q.	Witness, from what you saw, personally in April of 1994, you cannot give an account of what   Athanase Seromba did and said from the 12th of April to the 16th of April 1994; do you agree with me? 
A.	I don't clearly understand your question.  Could you kindly repeat it for me?  
Q.	Witness, what I am going to do, Witness, I am going to ask you a question, and then I'm going to ask you -- I want you to listen carefully to the question, and then I'm going to ask you whether or not you agree with me.
From what you yourself personally saw in April 1994, you -- is it true that you do not know what Athanase Seromba did or said from April 12th to April 16th 1994; do you agree with me that that is true?  
A.	You are trying to have me admit if it is true or not true.  Even if we did not witness all of the events that took place in the area, we certainly could have heard somebody talk about what he may have said. 
Q.	Okay, Witness, that means that you have perfectly understood my question.  What I'm asking you, I'm not asking you about what other people told you.  I'm asking you, from what you saw you don't know what Athanase Seromba did or said from April 12th to April 16th; is that so? 
A.	I believe that that is a difficult question.  In fact, I'm not sure I fully understand it, if you could kindly go back over it. 
Q.	Between April 12th and April 16th did you see, with your own eyes, Athanase Seromba? 
A.	I believe that I saw him, but I don't remember the date.  But when I saw him on that occasion he was on a motorbike. 
Q.	Yes, Witness, thank you.  From April 12th to April 16th, did you see him at the church? 
A.	No.  I did not see him at the church.  I have just told you that during that period I saw him one time, he was on the road.  He was riding a motorbike.  That is what I have said. 
Q.	Therefore, Witness, coming back to my question.  Since you did not see him at the church, what I'm asking you is this, from what you saw, you cannot say what he did at the church between April 12th to April 16th; isn't that so, Witness? 
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, the Defence finds it necessary to object to that question.  The witness has already answered it by saying that even though she did not witness an event she could have heard about it.  As such, we cannot go back over a question that the witness has sufficiently and clearly answered.  That's our objection, and we kindly request the Chamber to ask the Prosecution to move on. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Counsel.

Madam Prosecutor?  
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, this is the essence of my question; the witness said she did not understand.  And I appreciated this fact, and I went over question by question and I broke up the question into a series of smaller questions to ensure that the witness understood the direction I was going in.  Once it was clear to me that the witness understood, I then proposed to ask her the question I had originally asked her.  The witness understands the questions.  And there is no reason for counsel not to trust his witness, that his witness does not understand or cannot answer the question as posed, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, could you kindly answer the question that was put to you?  
THE WITNESS:
I would ask counsel to repeat it for me so that I can answer it. 
BY MR. ALEXIS:  
Q.	I will do so.  I am asking you, Witness, since you said you never saw Athanase Seromba except on a motor cycle after the 11th of April 1994.  My question is this, between the 12th of April 1994 and the 16th of April 1994, from what you saw, you cannot tell this Court what Athanase Seromba did at the church; isn't that so, Witness? 
A.	I thought I answered that question.  You said that I am not in a position to say anything or confirm anything for the Chamber about that.  What do you want me to explain further in detail?  Please explain that to me.  I think I have already answered the question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, in that case just repeat the answer that you gave. 
THE WITNESS:
This is what I have just said, the Prosecution says that I can't say who such and such -- or what, rather, such and such a person did at such and such a time.  I said that I would have been in a position to learn about what they did.  At that time people knew what was going on.  Given the events that were going on, we paid attention to know what was going on.  We would have been able to learn about things from people who were passing by.  We talked with those passers by and they would tell us what was going on.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, the witness answered in that manner.  Do you have any further questions?  
MS. ALEXIS:
I would just now ask to go into closed session for a very short period.  And, thereafter, I would ask when we are back in closed -- open session, sorry, for the witness to be shown one photograph.  And that would be the end of my cross-examination. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Madam Prosecutor.  

Does the Defence have any objection to the closed session?  
MR. NEKUIE:
No, Madam President, we do not. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The chamber therefore orders a closed session for the purposes of protecting this witness and in the interest of justice.  We apologise for any inconvenience cause today the public.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 26 to 27] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 14 to 25 by Donna M. Lewis)

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, you may proceed in open session. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Yes, please, Madam President.  
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, I have one more question with respect to your brother.  I would ask you not to mention his name.  After the events of April 1994, did you ever have a discussion with your brother about the killings at Nyange and the destruction of the church? 
A.	I never had any discussion with him in that regard. 
Q.	Can you recall, Witness, you said that you had discussions with other persons and so you learned of what was going on.  If you recall, can you tell us who were these other persons you had discussions with? 
A.	To what kind of person are you referring?  A person to whom I -- I may have spoken with?  In fact, we were in a time of war and we didn't have conversations as such.  There were unusual events that took place.  There were people who would be passing by here and there.  Given the fact that everyone was afraid, one wouldn't be able to have a conversation as such.  And since my brother was absent as I had said, we were afraid.  People had really changed, or they were preoccupied or concerned with other issues.  So we didn't have time to have normal conversation.  But when people passed by, we would learn of things here and there, because when people pass by, and we got to learn about how events happened here and there, so we learned about a lot of things. 
Q.	Witness, finally, since you said people changed, would you agree with me that people who had not been killers before April 1994, became killers in April 1994? 
A.	You were saying that people were not killers and then they became killers afterwards?  But let me tell you that before the war, I never saw anyone kill.  I never saw anyone kill another.  But when the war began, the situation was quite different.  I saw people commit killings. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, might this witness be shown what was entered into evidence as Prosecution Exhibit 321?  
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, do you have that photograph before you? 
A.	Yes, I have a photograph here. 
Q.	Since you were a member, can you tell us if that photograph is a photograph of Nyange parish church before its destruction? 
A.	I realise that it's a church, but I do not remember whether it is specifically Nyange church. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Thank you, Witness. 

Madam President, these are all my questions for this witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Madam Prosecutor. 

The Defence, do you wish to have re-examination of this witness?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
No, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We thank you. 

Madam Witness, we thank you for having kindly come to answer questions put to you.  You have now come to the end of your testimony before this Chamber, and we would wish to thank you and to wish you a safe return home.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  However, I have a request to make of the Chamber by your leave, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Witness; we are all ears. 
THE WITNESS:
I would like to ask permission to be able to greet the priest of my parish.  It is a long time since we have seen one another and, therefore, I would like to ask you to allow me to say "hello" to him. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, we are going to give you the same answer as we have to all the other witnesses who have made the same request.  Your counsel will be able to make a request of the relevant authorities to enable you to have a meeting with Father Seromba. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you very much, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We also wish to thank you, Madam Witness, and goodbye.  
(Witness exited)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, I believe the next witness you wish to cross-examine is Witness BZ14, is that correct?  
MR. MOSES:
That is correct.  I was just wondering whether Your Honours, whilst we're waiting for that witness to be brought in, whether we could have an update on the order of proposed Defence witnesses.  We know that the next witness will be Witness YA1.  Yesterday my learned friend said he was going to contact WVSS to be advised as to which witnesses were going to come.  So that there are any delays minimised, I am wondering whether we can have an update on what progress is happening regarding witnesses. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  

Mr. Monthé, do you have any information regarding the arrival of your next witnesses?  
(Witness entered courtroom)
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, Your Honours, I thank the Prosecutor for his concern for the fate of Defence witnesses, but we, in the Defence; we are more concerned than he is.  Unfortunately, the department concerned, or the section concerned, have to contact us.  I told you, Madam President, that I needed to contact that section and I had hoped that I would be able to give this information without the witness being present.  But the first meeting we had with Ms. Bihegue and Mr. Sombe, Witness BZ8 was unwell, but he has fully recovered and should be arriving in Arusha, as an estimate, on the 12th of November.  And WVSS has also information on Witness FE36, FE35, CF14, who were to be here for the week of 14th to 18th; in other words, next week. 

Madam President, Your Honours, for our main witnesses who are presently detained in Rwanda, we are waiting for a letter from the judicial authorities there, and the WVSS has promised that it will contact the relevant judicial authorities so that we can determine whether we need to make submissions in conformity with Article 28 of the Statute.  But, together with the WVSS, which was diligently programming Witness BR1, B01 and PA1 for the week beginning 21st November, ending 25th November, and since it's understood that BR1 will also come to Arusha for another trial; consequently, WVSS has said that it needs to rearrange certain things.  

And finally, for the last week of November, I believe counsel means, although he said December, we have Witness NA1 and Witness FE25.  This is with a big question mark with regard to what the Rwandan authorities will be doing.  But this is information which I am able to provide to the Chamber, although I am constantly in contact with the WVSS and I will contact you if there are any changes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you.  What about Witness YA1?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
YA1 arrived, as I indicated, last Sunday, and according to the section, he should normally rest for a few days before he testifies, and I understand that since the witness -- the Prosecution was going to complete his cross-examination of other witnesses previously, but Witness YA1 is present and he is ready to testify. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you for all that information.  

Mr. Prosecutor, you therefore have the information you required.  Now, we may certainly move and take Witness BZ14, continue with the witnesses who have already been examined in-chief by the Defence, and then we will possibly be able to go to Witness A1.  So you have the floor, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honours.  
WITNESS BZ14,
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, do you agree that you first spoke to the Defence for Seromba on the 2nd of December 2004? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And you made a statement and signed that statement on the 2nd of December 2004, didn't you? 
A.	Yes, I confirm that. 
Q.	And before the 2nd of December 2004, you had made no previous statements about the events at Nyange church to anyone, is that correct? 
A.	I never gave any statement.  This is the first time that I am testifying in a trial concerning these events. 
Q.	The first time you made a statement about the events at Nyange was more than ten and a half years after those events of April 1994; that's correct, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, that's right. 
Q.	And you saw the Defence again for a second occasion on the 10th of March this year, 2005, and you made a statement again on that occasion, didn't you? 
A.	Yes, that's correct. 
Q.	And you signed that statement as well, didn't you? 
A.	That's right. 
Q.	You left Rwanda in 1994 after the events at Nyange? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And you've not been back to Rwanda since, is that correct? 
A.	No, I never went back there. 
Q.	According to your -- the evidence that you gave last week in Court, is it the case that, on the day after President Habyarimana had died, you just happened to come across Ndungutse in a local bar, is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that's where I met him. 
Q.	It was just a coincidence that you came across Ndungutse in this bar? 
A.	I was walking and it so happened that I met him in that place.  I did not know why he had come there, but it was just like people liked to meet at the centre or in the village. 
Q.	And I think you told the Trial Chamber last week that it was some time later that same day that you saw smoke going up in -- coming from the cellule in which Ndungutse resided, is that right? 
A.	I didn't say that I saw him.  Rather, what I said was that he had been attacked. 
Q.	I will repeat my question in case there has been a translation problem.  Last week when you gave evidence, you said that some time after that you had seen Ndungutse at this bar, that you saw smoke going up into the sky and you were told that an attack had originated from Ndungutse's cellule.  That's what you told us last week, isn't it? 
A.	Well, let me go back to what I said in Kinyarwanda.  One can meet because you have come to a place at the invitation of the other person.  Now, given the question that I had just been asked, I had misunderstood.  I heard a word which meant "builder" and not "smoke".  That's why I misunderstood your question. 
Q.	Well, can you answer my question?  Is it correct that--?
A.	Yes, indeed.  I saw the smoke at that time, and I saw that the smoke was coming from the direction in which (unintelligible) lived.  I don't know whether that's the event that you're referring to. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, would you agree with me that prior to the events of April 1994, that Tutsi had gone to take refuge in churches -- in church (sic) when they were being threatened? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I didn't speak of events which allegedly took place before April.  Rather, I testified on events which occurred during the events themselves. 
Q.	Well, I'm asking a question, Witness.  Do you agree that, prior to the events of April 1994, Tutsis would take shelter in churches if they were being threatened? 
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President --
THE WITNESS:
Mr. Prosecutor, I would really like to understand what period of time you're referring to.  Is it during peace time, or are you referring to a period where there was some insecurity, like in 1973, for instance.  Maybe if you're referring to 1973, I can tell you.  But if you are talking about another period, I wouldn't be able to tell you anything at all.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, yes?
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, the witness has gone on and responded, and I believe he has requested what is appropriate of the Prosecution. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Mr. Prosecutor, you may proceed. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	In 1973, did Tutsis take refuge in the church when they were being threatened? 
A.	I have explained that, following that question put to me by counsel, that I heard it said that these people were seeking refuge in that place.  But I heard it said that normally these people would go to seek refuge in the parish.  I'd heard it said. 
Q.	Would you agree with me, Witness, that if someone such as Ndungutse had wanted to gather Tutsi together in one place to kill them, then he would have known that, by burning some houses in the hills, that that would have the effect of having the Tutsis gather together at the church? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I spoke to you of what I heard -- I'd heard him say.  Now, as for his aims or objectives, I don't know.  I told you what he said and what he did.  As for his ideas or his intention, I wouldn't be able to tell you much. 
Q.	Would you agree with me, however, that it would be a simple but effective plan to get the Tutsis all together in one place at the church if people such as Ndungutse decided to attack and target some Tutsis in the hills?  Would you agree with that as a proposition, Witness? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, you can see someone, but it is difficult to see into his soul.  You cannot read anyone's mind.  You can see someone.  You can see him moving about, but how are you going to be able to read his mind?
Q.	So your evidence is that you don't know whether Ndungutse had a plan or whether he had planned with others to have Tutsis go to the church; is that your evidence? 
A.	You are asking me whether he had any plan.  The fact remains that he obtained his objective, but that is a conclusion.  It's an observation that we made.  I'm not saying that he didn't have any plan like you described, but we saw what he did, and we cannot say that he didn't have a plan in the way you suggested.  I don't know whether I've explained myself well enough, Mr. Prosecutor, or I don't know whether you want further explanation regarding this issue. 
Q.	No thank you, Witness.  You told the Trial Chamber last week that you believed Father Straton was the priest at Nyange church, didn't you? 
A.	Yes, indeed. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, the witness has never said that it was the priest.  He had said that it was the parish priest, because the parish priest is the one who is in control of the parish. 
MR. MOSES:
Your Honours, I will read the question and answer that was given last week.  The question that my friend asked this witness last week was:   "Witness, in 1994 you said that you used to go to Nyange church.  Now, tell the Chamber who was the priest at the church at that time, and tell us whether you knew the person?" The answer which the witness gave was:   "I believe that the priest was named Straton.  I also knew Father Seromba."

So I've -- to answer my friend's objection, I have fairly put to this witness the evidence that he gave last week, and the witness has agreed in his answer that that is the evidence that he gave last week. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, do you want to repeat what you had said earlier?
THE WITNESS:
With regard to that priest or these priests, they are all there.  Otherwise there were priests, including a parish priest at the time, and I knew the two very well.  I never said that either one of them was present and not the other.  Both of them lived at the parish. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, it would seem that the witness said that in 1994 it was Father Straton who was the parish priest, and that there was -- and that he knew Father Seromba, too, in January 1994. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Quite so, Madam President.  Otherwise, the question wouldn't have any meaning, because I'm the one who put that question to the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor?  
MR. MOSES:
I'm simply -- I've quoted from the draft English transcripts which have been provided to counsel, and I have accurately quoted what is recorded there, Your Honours.  I'm happy to move on in any event. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Maybe you're reading the text in English, because we noticed what was said in the French.  Maybe there was a problem of interpretation. 
MR. MOSES:
In any event, witness, thank you, Your Honours.  I'm sorry. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, did you know that Father Straton had left the church by the time of the destruction of the church at Nyange? 
A.	I didn't see that.  I believe I was asked questions about the events that took place during the war, but I didn't speak about the living conditions or facts related to the priests' lives. 
Q.	It's fair to say that you weren't very involved in church matters, were you? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, let me tell you that there are three different categories.  I speak, you speak to me, there are others who listen.  If you go outside and people ask you if BZ14 has arrived here, I don't know if you would deny or accept that.  At the time I wasn't a blind man.  I knew what was going on.  I was there. 
Q.	That's not my question, Witness.  My question for you was that you were not very involved in church affairs, were you, at that time? 
A.	Are you talking about activities related to Masses or activities related to the war?  
Q.	I'm talking about your involvement in the church at that time of April of 1994.  You weren't very involved in those matters.  You weren't aware that Father Straton had left.  
A.	I had never worked for the parish. 
Q.	All right.  Now, Witness, did you actually see with your own eyes any Tutsi leaving their houses after the president's death?  Now, by that I don't mean that whether you saw Tutsis walking on the way to the church; I'm specifically asking you whether you saw any Tutsis pack up and leave their houses? 
A.	When the Tutsis would go to the parish, they would go one by one.  You could see a few of them.  Otherwise, they would go discreetly.  For my part, I didn't see any Tutsis go to the parish.  It was not ceremonious.  They were fleeing.  You must understand, they were fleeing death.  Someone who was going to do that would not do so in broad daylight with everyone knowing about it.  They would do it discreetly. 
Q.	So that there's no misunderstanding, do I understand from your answer that you didn't see anyone, any Tutsis, actually leaving their houses because it used to happen at night.  I don't want to misinterpret what you've said, so have I accurately summed up what you've just told us? 
A.	I think that you've understood me. 
Q.	Would you agree with me that there were at least two thousand Tutsis who eventually took refuge in the church at Nyange? 
A.	I never heard the number that you mentioned.  Furthermore, nobody counted how many refugees there were to determine their exact number.  You found out that number one way or another.  I don't know.  I know that there were many Tutsis.  On the 15th I was able to go to the parish, but I didn't know how many refugees were there. 
Q.	All right.  Now, last week when you gave evidence, and we're talking about the refugees going to the parish, you said, "Every person went voluntarily.  They were trying to save their skin.  Nobody forced anyone to flee at that time."  Do you remember saying that, Witness? 
A.	I remember. 
Q.	And you made that statement that nobody forced anyone to flee at that time based on having seen no one leave their homes, according to the evidence that you've just given in Court today; isn't that right? 
A.	That is correct.  Nobody forced anyone to flee.  Everyone fled voluntarily.  They did not force anyone to flee. 
Q.	But you didn't see anyone leave their homes, Witness.  You said it happened at night-time.  How can you say that nobody forced anyone to leave? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, you're asking me a question that you already understand.  Did somebody go to tell those people to flee, and did they start at a specific location?  Did they ask the people in all of the commune to flee?  Would those people or would that person have used a plane to ask those people to flee?  Would they have gone to them one by one asking them to flee?  Explain to me how they would have done it. 
Q.	I'll ask the questions, Witness.  You spoke last week of a Mr. Rakariyu who'd had his house burnt.  Do you remember talking about Mr. Rakariyu? 
A.	I remember. 
Q.	Did he leave his home voluntarily, Witness, or do you think he was forced to flee by having his house burnt? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, if your house is being burnt down, the people burning it are trying to kill you.  The war didn't break out only in our area; it was everywhere.  So he fled voluntarily because he was under attack, otherwise he would have been killed.  When you're afraid, when you're under attack, you use every means possible to defend yourself. 
Q.	So I take it that your answer is that he was not forced to flee.  
A.	I've explained it.  When you're attacked, you flee.  If someone is attacking you at home, are you going to stand there looking at the person without doing anything, or would your reaction be to flee?
Q.	All right.  We'll move on.  The first time that you went to Nyange church after the death of President Habyarimana was on the 15th of April, is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	What day of the week was that? 
A.	I don't remember what day it was, but I do remember it was on that date. 
Q.	What time did you arrive? 
A.	I said that I arrived at 11 or 11:30 in the morning.

1750H  
MR. MOSES:
I will ask the witness be shown Photograph 3, Prosecution Exhibit 3-21. 
BY MR. MOSES:  
Q.	Witness, can you confirm to us that that was the photo of Nyange church not prior to having been bulldozed in April 1994?  
A.	Yes, this is indeed, Nyange church. 
Q.	Don't tell us where you lived, but can you tell the Trial Chamber how long did it take to go from your home to Nyange church?  
A.	It didn't take me long.  You are right to show me this photograph.  I was at the primary school with the nuns.  I left school; I would go to eat at home.  Remember we had an hour and a half break.  So if I would leave school for meal at home, it means it wasn't far.  Maybe it was less than two and half or three kilometres or in fact less than two and half kilometres distances. 
Q.	Focusing if you can on the 15th of April, the day that you remember, can you tell the Trial Chamber, what time did you leave the church?  You have told us you leave the Nyange, you have told us that you arrive there around 11 or 11:30, what time did you leave to go back home?  
A.	I left the church in the evening between 4:30 p.m. in the evening.  It was in the evening before the sunset.
Q.	Now, if I understand - - 
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, I am going to be moving on to a topic which going to take a little while. I am happy to start, but I would like to finish the topic and it might go beyond 6 o'clock.  So I am in Your Honours' hands whether you want me to start this topic now or whether we should start tomorrow afternoon. I am relaxed all the way. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Monthé.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Yes, Madam President. It seems that you have dealt with the calendar and so we started at 2:00 so that the accused could go back at a reasonable time.  So I am surprised by the Prosecution's request. We really shouldn't go past 6:00 p.m.  We have agreed that we should stop at 6 so that Father Seromba could go at a reasonable time back to the detention facility.  This is the concern that the Defence has which is important.  You also indicated that the interpreters also have to leave at 6, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I believe that what you said is along the same lines as what the Prosecutor has just indicated.  He is asking us if we can stop now and resume tomorrow and in fact that is what we have decided to do.  

We are going to adjourn these proceedings for the time being, Mr. Witness.  We should like to remind you that you are still under oath.  Tomorrow the Prosecutor will continue with his cross-examination of you. That will be at 2:00 o'clock just as it was today.  So we resume tomorrow at 2:00 p.m.  Good evening to all.  

Thank you.  The proceeding is adjourned for this evening.  
(Court adjourned at 1800H)
