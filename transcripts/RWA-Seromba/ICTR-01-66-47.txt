MADAM PRESIDENT:
The session resumes.  Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. 

Mr. Witness, good afternoon.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, apparently the witness cannot hear the interpretation. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(No interpretation) 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you Witness FE35?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that's correct.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Monthé? 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, Madam President, I'm somewhat flabbergasted, gobsmacked, because my assistant and my co-counsel met this witness this morning, who had had an asthma attack last night.  After he left the safe house, he was taken to the hospital.  And when I left the interpreter's booth, I saw him walking with difficulty.  He indicated to my co-counsel that he would not be able to testify this afternoon because of his health and because of how weak he was.  

We had the courtesy to refer to the coordinator of this Trial Chamber on this matter, and we thought that this matter should be raised before you, Your Honours.  And we are surprised to see this gentleman being brought here, as when I was pleading before the army -- courts martial before witnesses.  I am surprised to see that this witness is coming here.  And are we going to force him to testify although he is unwell?  

Madam President, Your Honours, we have requested, against our own will, that this witness does not appear today because he is unable to do so.  He is not fit to do so.  We are surprised, therefore, that he is here in the courtroom against our wish, whereas we have taken all the necessary measures.  And we have been courteous and respectful and in respect of the rules of procedure so that there be a fair trial. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated) 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, we cannot examine a witness who is unwell.  We have never done that.  We will never do it, and this is never in our intent to do so. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We do not have the habit of having witnesses come here if they are not willing to do so.  We have been informed that this witness was unwell.  And what we said is that, if the witness is able to appear and testify, he will come.  If he can answer questions, he will answer.  

The witness is here.  We are going to ask him questions.  You know, an asthma attack can indeed be quite spectacular, and then after a certain moment, the crisis passes and the person is able to do what they normally do without too much difficulty.  

Mr. Witness -- 

Can he be given his headphones again, please? 

Mr. Witness, did you see the doctor today?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I consulted the doctor today, and he asked for an x-ray to be done. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Presently, how do you feel? 
THE WITNESS:
I think I can testify for a certain amount of time, and maybe after a certain moment, you could allow me to go and rest.  Otherwise, I can testify for a little bit, and then we could take a break. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated) 

I'm going to turn to the Defence now.  Did you hear the witness's answer?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I do apologise.  I do not want to be irreverential in my manner, but this man is frightened by your sovereignty.  And he says he has just seen the doctor and an x-ray has been asked to be taken and he can speak, and then he's asking for a break subsequently.  He cannot speak properly.  I think, in your place and in my place, we need to do our job properly.  He has just spoken, but if we do not respect what he is saying, we will not be doing full justice to him.  

We have never asked anything of your Chamber.  What I am suggesting, Madam President, that this man comes tomorrow afternoon.  We have given the Prosecutor four days yesterday.  This is a sick man, and this is why you are asking that we come back to the session tomorrow, because we have given the Prosecutor until Thursday. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
(Microphones overlapping) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness has said that he is able to answer, and let him do that.  Often we have heard witnesses say here, and we do observe immediately if you feel tired, you can give us a sign.  We have done this on several occasions.  It's not because we have some grudge or other against this witness.  Very often witnesses who come here are tired, and we know this and we do take that into due account.  

Mr. Witness, we believe that you are not afraid of us.  You do not have to be afraid of us.  Please speak as freely as you wish.  If, as you have stated, you believe that you are able to answer questions, when you feel tired, please inform us, and then at that point in time, we will stop.  And we can do that because we have not for the time being received any document saying that you are not able to testify today.  But if you feel, and you tell us, that you cannot, we shall not insist.  

Are you able to answer questions, as you mentioned a moment ago, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
I'm going to answer the questions which will be put to me, depending on what I know.  Immediately I feel tired, I shall inform the Chamber.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Mr. Witness.  We thank you for your statement.
THE WITNESS:
I also wish to thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I am going to explain to you how things are going to be happening.  You will, first of all, be examined by the Defence.  Because you are a protected Defence witness, you are going to be referred to as Witness FE35.  Above all, please do not give any details which are likely to reveal your identity.  

Before you answer questions from the Defence, and possibly from the Office of the Prosecutor, if you are well enough to continue that that far, we are going to ask you to take a solemn declaration.
(Declaration made by Witness FE35 in Kinyarwanda) 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  

MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
I also wish to thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I am now turning to the Defence, who will be taking the examination-in-chief of this witness. 

Is it Mr. Nekuie?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Mr. Nekuie. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Madam President.  

Madam President, Your Honours, I must admit that it's against our will that we are finding ourselves as having to begin the examination-in-chief of this witness, FE35, this afternoon.  Because I met this witness myself this morning, and when I realised how weak he was, I asked him once to find out whether he was able to come here this afternoon to testify.  And he said exactly the same as he told your Chamber, namely, that he would be able to start but that if he felt tired he would ask for permission to -- for an adjournment.  

And when we had an exchange, in order to prepare him for this afternoon's session, I once again asked him if he felt sincerely that he was ready to testify.  And that time around, the witness told me that, very sincerely, he would wish that he would be able to benefit from this day so that he can recover from yesterday's tiredness.  We were so concerned about his status that we mentioned this to the witness section, who sent a vehicle to take him to the clinic.  

So I'm convinced, Madam President, Your Honours, that this witness is not fully fit to begin his -- his examination-in-chief.  But since we are before your sovereign decision, Madam President, Your Honours, let me inform your Chamber that I prepared about 100 questions for this witness, and I will comply with your decision, your ruling, by beginning this examination, which I would have rather be carried out under more appropriate conditions.  

This is my -- this is what I would wish to inform your Chamber of, without any bitterness or any other kind of negative feeling.  But with your permission, Madam President, Your Honours, I shall now address the witness.
WITNESS FE35,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness FE35, good afternoon.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	I hope very sincerely that you are going to be able to go through this examination-in-chief this afternoon.  We have taken due note of the fact that, if you physically feel weak, you are going to ask for permission for us to adjourn.  And I do sincerely hope that you will indeed do so whenever you do feel tired.  Have you understood? 
A.	Yes, I have understood you, Counsel.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, Your Honours, before I indeed begin my examination-in-chief of this witness, I must say that we were hoping that this session would be postponed till tomorrow, and we have not been able to have enough copies of the identification sheet for this witness.  

I do not know whether we will be able to deal with only one single copy, which will be given to the witness, which -- who will then be asked to authenticate the document and check on its veracity.  
THE WITNESS:
I have just realised that the information contained on this identification sheet is correct.  Consequently, we can commence the examination-in-chief.  
MR. NEKUIE:
I thank you, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
I thank you.  
JUDGE HÖKBORG:
Well, being the English-speaking, so to speak, person on the Bench, we have a medical certificate here, and it is signed by the UNICTR health services unit, Dr. Epee, and it's dated Arusha, 22/11/2005, and it says, "This is to certify that the Witness FE35 is fit," and that is circled, "to testify before the Court." 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you may proceed.  The witness has just said that the information on his identification sheet is correct.  
MR. NEKUIE:
I wish to thank Judge Hökborg for the information given, but the Defence is already ready to proceed with the examination-in-chief.  And in that vein, Madam President, Your Honours, I request your Chamber to kindly admit the identification sheet that has been -- has been acknowledged by the witness as a Defence exhibit.  And its number -- reference number will be -- I hope the registry can help me in this, with the number, and that this document be placed under seal, Your Honours. 
MR. DIALLO:  
D. 59 is the number for this document. 
MR. NEKUIE:
(No interpretation)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objection from the Prosecution for the admission of this document?  

I see you nodding "no."  This document dealing with the identification details of Witness FE35 is admitted as a Defence exhibit under seal and will be referred to as D. 59. 
(Exhibit No. D. 59 admitted, under seal) 
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness FE35, where were you in April 1994?  Were you living in Rwanda, and, if so, in which area were you? 
A.	I lived in Rwanda in the (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) commune in (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) secteur, (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) cellule, (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) parish. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Do you mean that ***************(By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) ******* 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we should like to draw your attention to the fact that we are in an open session. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, indeed there was -- there were so many preliminary matters that we had to deal with that I forgot.  Indeed, this witness just says the two before him is quite concerned about his safety, and the Defence is also concerned this Defence witness was swarmed by journalists in Rwanda and underwent the same threats that FE36 did.  We had hoped, Madam President, that those three witnesses could all testify in closed session.  As such, Madam President, Your Honours, I make that request before I continue with my examination-in-chief of this witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, do you have an objection?  

MR. MOSES:
I do, Your Honours.  As opposed to the last two witnesses, who, by the nature -- either the nature of the evidence or by their occupation it would have been apparent or could become apparent as to who those previous witnesses were, you will note that we did not object to certain evidence being led in closed session.  

I have seen the statements provided by the Defence, and, with the greatest respect to my learned friend, there is nothing to do with this witness's occupation or the nature of his evidence that would lead to his identification.  If the -- for the -- certainly the vast majority of his evidence could be led in open session without there being any danger to his identity being revealed.  

If there are specific matters which my friend wishes to raise regarding this witness which could lead to his identification, I would not oppose such an application.  But to ask for his entire evidence to be heard in closed session I do oppose because there is nothing in his evidence of a specific nature which would lead to his identification.  

Those are our submissions, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Since the witness gave some information that must be removed from the record, we are going to begin in a closed session.  

Make an effort to ask all of the questions in that closed session that might lead to his identity being revealed, and in open session thereafter, you can ask him your remaining questions, Counsel.  

We're now going to move to a closed session.  This is for the protection of this witness and in the interests of justice.  

We apologise for the members of the public.
