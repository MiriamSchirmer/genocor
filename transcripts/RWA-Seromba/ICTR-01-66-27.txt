MADAM PRESIDENT:
The session is called to order.  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, I hope you had a good weekend.  We shall continue the cross-examination of Witness CBR.    

Counsel for the Defence, you have the floor, Mr. Pognon, for the continuation of the 
cross-examination.
MR. POGNON:
Thank you, Madam President .

When we broke off on Friday I had stated that I would need maybe an hour and a half to continue with my cross-examination of this witness, but now, when I looked again at the case, I think I have only one or two points to tackle with the witness and then I will be done.
WITNESS CBR
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	I wish to refer to the transcripts of the last session and I shall also refer to the written statements, and we are looking at page 24 and page 25 of the transcripts.  This was cross-examination -- the examination-in-chief by Mr. Moses.  Mr. Moss put a question to the witness in regard to the day of Friday, the 15th of April, and the question is at line 18 of page 25.  "The name of the priest who was with the gendarmes, was that name mentioned by your leader?"  

By leave of the Court, I wish to remind us all what was happening.  It's when the refugees had gone back after Rukara had thrown grenades at the presbytery, and there was this controversy between the refugees who wanted to go into the presbytery.  Now Mr. Moses's question concerning that episode: "Was the name of the priest who was with the gendarmes, was that name mentioned by your leader?  Answer: "Yes.  They mentioned the name of the priest Ndugutse.  They didn't even tell us the name of the priest, whether it was a father or priest, they were saying Seromba and they said that Seromba did not allow us to get into the courtyard of the presbytery before we removed this filth."

Now, Mr. Witness, you made that statement on Friday.  Do you admit to having made this statement, which was recorded by the stenographers?
A.	Yes, I can confirm having made that statement concerning that Friday, as you have stated, because the person who was asking me questions wondered whether the name of the father had been mentioned, and I said that that was the case.
Q.	In other words, you confirm that the words you spoke regarding your leader, the words were -- they said that, "Seromba did not even allow us to enter the courtyard of the presbytery before we removed the filth."  I've read it again.
A.	Yes, that was what was said.  It was, in fact, the time when the priest had not allowed or prevented the people to enter the courtyard of the presbytery, they were asking for the killings to stop, first of all, and those were the words that were spoken at that time.
Q.	Do you confirm that you yourself -- do you confirm that it was your leaders who went to see the priest and you were outside a response.  Is that what you are saying?
A.	Yes, that's how it happened.  Our leaders were in the front, and we were ready to attack, we were ready to enter.  So the leaders were in front of us, and when the priests and gendarmes were at the gate they were opposite our leaders.  But we were getting ready to enter.  Normally, it was the leader who would show us the way to go.
Q.	Thank you.  I want to refer now to page 39, and here you are being cross-examined by Defence counsel regarding the same circumstances on that page 39 of the French transcripts.  In relation to that incident, where the priest sent back your leaders at the gates to the presbytery, this time around you said the following at line 37 -- no, rather, it's line 36:  "He stopped them from doing so.  He asked them what they wanted, and the authorities told him that they wanted to kill the refugees who were in that part.  He told them, 'Listen, look around, first of all, "Clear this filth."  There were dead bodies and bricks."  The same circumstance, the same incident that you are referring to now, when you were being examined by the Prosecutor, it was your leaders who said that Seromba did not want to let you kill the refugees before you clear the filth.  

Now, the same incident, you place in the mouth of the priest the following, he said, "Listen, look around and clear this filth."  First of all, what is the true situation?
A.	Yes, but the two versions are not different.  He said this when they were coming out.  He was stopping them from entering because of the presence of the dead bodies and the bricks.  "Before you proceed, you have to clear this filth."  Consequently, I believe that if you were to compare the two versions, there's no difference.  But, you know, French, English, and Kinyarwanda are languages which are different, so you will understand that there were many people.  Some heard the priest say these words, others did not hear him speak because there were many people.  It was necessary that the leaders tell the population what had happened, and that's how it happened.  In fact, we had to stop for about one hour in order to remove the dead bodies, and we only continued with the killings after having removed the dead bodies.  

Consequently, what I said at different moments tally.  The priest did, in fact, mention those words and, subsequently, the authorities carried forward the message.  I was speaking of events of which I was a witness.  I wasn't a refugee.  I wasn't being chased.  I was one of the persons, rather, who was going after the refugees.  So you will understand that at that point in time he did not allow us to enter after we had removed the dead bodies, and we had to do so, first of all.
Q.	So what should we understand?  Should we understand that the direct version.  In other words, the words put in the mouth of Father Seromba, as you mention them the second time around, and the words which you placed in the mouth of your leaders speaking about the same situation, you believe that those words are the same and they conform to the truth?
A.	The authorities reported to us what the priest had told them.  Those were words which they reported to us as having been said by the priest, and when the priest was speaking, I was close to these people.  I heard the priest speak those words and then the authorities later on transmitted the message to the people.  It was necessary that all the people be aware of what was happening.  We were following the instruction of these people.  We did so.  When we were asked to work, we did so.  When we were asked to stop we obeyed.  It was necessary the killings be stopped, and remember, I told you that there were many people, and it was towards evening, before nightfall.  It was necessary, therefore, to remove the dead bodies.  And I'm saying that if he said those words it was, in fact, because of the large number of dead bodies.  He himself didn't believe that we could remove the dead bodies.  We took about a whole hour to bury those bodies, and you can imagine the number of the dead bodies because they were buried by the heavy equipment.
Q.	According to you, since overall you say you saw the father on the 15th, after the killings, and on the 16th in the morning -- according to you, was it Father Seromba who was leading the attackers?
A.	During those two days on which you said I saw the father in question, he was not the one leading us.  I'm talking about, we ourselves.  What I mean is that before the authorities gave us any instructions, whatsoever, they had to discuss with the pastor.  I couldn't tell you what they were saying because they were on one side.  So our authorities, the leaders, before they gave us any instructions, they had to speak with the father, be it on the 15th or the 16th.  Before we did anything whatsoever, the authorities had to speak with the father.  But, personally, I never saw the father lead us.  We had our own leaders.  In our cellule there was a responsable de cellule who would meet all the authorities at all levels.  He attended meetings and he told us what decisions were taken during those meetings.  And that's what I saw as having taken place.
Q.	The authorities, which you claim were speaking with the priest, did they tell you, specifically, that the father asked you to proceed and kill?
A.	I beg your pardon, Counsel.  I'm telling you that we obeyed the instructions of the authorities.  Once they spoke with the priest, they would ask us to start our work.  On the 15th, after their discussion, they came back and they asked us to start killing the Tutsis.  On the 16th, before the officials of the commune opened fire, he himself and the IPJ spoke with the priest.  Truthfully, I did not participate in their meetings.  I did not discuss with them.  I couldn't go to the place where these meetings were held?  But once the meetings were concluded and decisions were made, these authorities would give us instructions as to what we needed to do.  I wasn't even an official of the cellule, myself.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We didn't hear what counsel said in the booth, unfortunately.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Mr. Prosecutor, do you have any further questions for this witness?
MR. MOSES:
No, I don't, Your Honours.  For everyone's benefit, Defence, Your Honours, and our benefit, if the record perhaps be noted when my friend was putting quotations from the previous transcripts lines and pages that are from the draft transcripts, and often we find that the final transcripts have different pages and line numbers, so that if someone is looking for that quotation it won't -- it may well not be the line and page that has been referred to, but are simple -- I simply mention that because the quotations have come from the draft transcripts and not the final transcripts. 

I have no questions in re-examination for this witness, and unless Your Honours have any questions, we are in a position to call our final witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Mr. Prosecutor, for that specific mention.  We are working with a draft, and it is possible that the final document may not have the final page numbering.  We will, therefore, have to rely on the final transcripts in order to mention the page numbers and line numbers. 

Mr. Witness, we have come to the end of your testimony before this Tribunal.  We thank you for having come to testify and having answered questions which were put to you.  We wish you a safe return home, and thank you very much, once again.
THE WITNESS:
I also wish to thank you, Madam President, and Your Honours.  May God assist you in your work.  I am expressing this to you and the Judges who are on the Bench with you.  Thank you.
	(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, please usher in the next witness, in other words CNJ.  Is that correct, Mr. Prosecutor?
MR. POGNON:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Pognon, before the witness is ushered in.
MR. POGNON:
Yes, before the witness, I have some motions.  The first is that we are requesting your Chamber to get in touch with the registry so that we can work on Saturday with the Accused at the detention centre.  Normally, we work on Saturdays with the Accused at the detention facility and, generally speaking, when we are in session, this doesn't pose any problem.  It is quite easily done, and we go to the UNDF, but on Friday afternoon and last Saturday, we were prevented from doing so, and we wish to put this matter before your Chamber so that we can be allowed to work on Saturdays.  It's normally on Saturdays that Defence counsel work with the detainees.  I don't know why there is difficulty this time around.  That was my first motion. 

The second deal was a communication which we made during the last session regarding 
Exhibit D. 12, Exhibit D. 12, it's a document in Kinyarwanda which was translated from the booth while the witness was being heard.  I no longer remember the name of the pseudonym.  Now, that document, D. 12, was admitted provisionally because it was not clear and it was not legible.  The Prosecutor has just disclosed to us a clear and legible copy, and we wish, therefore, that the document be finally admitted and not admitted provisionally, so that this document, D. 12, is finally admitted -- formally admitted and not admitted provisionally, as was the case previously.  I thank you, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Mr. Pognon.  

Mr. Prosecutor, do you have any objections to the requests made by the Defence?
MR. MOSES:
No.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, now that we have a document which is more legible this document should be tendered.  Do you have a copy of this document which is clearer and more legible, the copy of D 12, so that document can be admitted as an exhibit?

Very well, the document which is now perfectly legible, is tendered as an exhibit, as we said, as D. 12, Defence Exhibit D 12. 
	(Exhibit No. D. 12 admitted)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
As regards the first question you put to us, Counsel, we will consult with UNDF as to why such restrictions were placed on you, and we shall report back to you. 

Good morning, Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are a Prosecution witness, and I believe that you are the last witness to appear on behalf of the Prosecutor in this case.  You are a protected witness, and we shall call you CNJ to protect your identity.  You will first be questioned by the Prosecutor and then cross-examined by the Defence.  We ask you to listen attentively to the questions that are put to you and to respond to them as specifically and as concisely as possible.  Before you answer the questions put to you by the Prosecutor, we should like to you take a solemn declaration.
	(Declaration made by Witness CNJ in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, you may proceed with your examination-in-chief of Witness CNJ.
MR. TOWNSEND:
May it please the Trial Chamber.  Thank you very much, Your Honours.
      WITNESS CNJ
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness CNJ, if you can just sit up so I can see you.  Thank you.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Your Honours, as is the normal custom, I've circulated a protected information sheet which bears the personal particulars of Witness CNJ.  A copy has been shown to the Defence, which is acknowledged on the back, and I'll proceed.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness CNJ, before you is a one-page document.  Do you see it?
A.	Yes, I see it.
Q.	Does that document bear your signature on the bottom and the date of 13 October 2004, which attests that the information contained is both true and accurate?
A.	Yes.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Your Honours, I would ask that document be marked as P. 24 and entered into evidence.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Pognon, Mr. Monthé, do you have any objection to the admission of this document ?.
MR. POGNON:
No.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, thank you.  The said document bearing the particulars of Witness CNJ is tendered, admitted, and marked as Prosecution Exhibit Number P. 24, and the said document shall be placed under seal.  You may proceed, Mr. Prosecutor.
 (Exhibit No. P. 24 admitted, under seal)
MR. TOWNSEND:
I would ask that the monitor of the witness be put on so that he may see the photograph on the projector presently.
The photograph on the monitors is photograph 3-21 and it should come up on all of our screens.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness CNJ, do you see on your monitor in front of you a photograph, yes or no?
A.	I do not see any photograph.  It appears that the screen is not turned on.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Maybe, if it makes things easier Your Honour --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
May we turn on the screen?  Perhaps there is a technical problem we are not aware of.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Your Honours, maybe, just to save some time, if we all have that photograph admitted in record, maybe we can walk this photograph to the witness stand.  We'll do it that way.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Question to Witness CNJ.  Do you have a copy before you of a photograph, yes or no?
A.	Yes, I have it before me.
Q.	Can you tell the Judges what you see in that photograph?
A.	This is a photograph of Nyange church, of course before it was destroyed.
Q.	In April 1994, did you go to Nyange church?
A.	Yes.
Q.	On what day in April 1994 did you go to Nyange church?
A.	I went to Nyange church on a Friday, the 15th, and even on the next day, the Saturday, the 16th of April.
Q.	On the 15th of April did you go alone to Nyange church or with others?
A.	I went with many other people.
Q.	Were you with any particular group of people when you went on 15th April?
A.	Yes, there were some people who went with me, in particular, a group of eight from my cellule.  Of course on our way we met up with others.
MR. TOWNSEND:
My question, for the record, had he gone with any particular group, Your Honours.  I'll move to the next question.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	What was the purpose of your group?
A.	We were going to kill Tutsis who had sought refuge at Nyange parish.
Q.	To which ethnic group did your group of killers belong?
A.	We were Hutus.
Q.	Whom did your group target?
A.	We launched attacks against the Tutsis.  We were a group of Hutus.  We attacked those Tutsis who were taking refuge at Nyange parish.
Q.	On 15th April 1994, by what means of transport did you go to Nyange church?
A.	We left our houses on foot, but along the way we got into a tipper truck and we left thereafter in that truck.
Q.	Were you wearing a watch on 15 or 16 April 1994?
A.	I did not.
Q.	Can you estimate the time you arrived at the Nyange church on 15th April 1994?
A.	I remember we arrived between 11 in the morning and 1 p.m.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Your Honours, at this time I would ask that the curtains be drawn on this portion of the courtroom and that a sketch be put on the projector, a copy of which I have given to the Defence, and I am in a position to provide Defence an extra copy, if they so please; to allow him to step down to the projector.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, may the witness be allowed to go to the overhead projector?
MR. TOWNSEND:
For the record, Your Honours, this sketch has been marked with a K number which I will cite, which is K0334649.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Pognon.
MR. POGNON:
My learned colleague, indeed, gave me a copy of this sketch, which is his own work, according to what he said.  I would like for us to have a sketch of the area, if it exists, so that we may avoid any approximations and estimates as regards this exercise.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.
MR. TOWNSEND:
I'm not sure what counsel means by his remarks.  This sketch is authored by and signed by the witness, CNJ, and it is his representation, to the best of his ability, and he is about to explain.  I think, to allay the Chamber, I think there is another sketch already in evidence, unless Defence seeks to present their own evidence.  I'm more than willing to do so.  I'm ready to proceed.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Pognon.
MR. POGNON:
The problem is that if there is a sketch, drafted by the person who was tasked to do so, it would be better to show that one, rather than a sketch made by the witness that is subjective.  The Defence contests this.  If there is a sketch that already exists, we should present that one.  It was drafted by an expert sent by the Office of the Prosecutor, and that is the sketch we should use. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, perhaps here this is the Prosecutor's strategy who has asked the witness to draw his own sketch.  We do indeed have another sketch in the case file, but, of course, you have the right, Counsel, to challenge this if you don't agree with the procedure.
MR. POGNON:
Yes, thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, you have the floor.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you very much, Your Honours.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness CNJ, I'm putting a one-page document in front of you on the projector.  Can you please tell us what that is?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, we cannot hear the witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
May the witness repeat his answer; and registry, can you verify whether the microphone is on and, as such, we can't have their interpretation of what is said.
THE WITNESS:
Here before us we have a sketch that I authored on the 25th of September 2004.  I myself drew the sketch as indicated by the letters CNJ on the sketch.  This sketch is a representation of Nyange centre.  It shows where the church was located; you also see the presbytery and the secretariat.  Here you have a courtyard in front of the church.  There's a road which veers off from the main road, the Gitarama-Kibuye road, and that artery goes towards the church.  Here you have a eucalyptus forest between the Kibuye road and the small road that leads to the church.  Next to that small road you have the restaurant which belonged to CARITAS, and then there is some buildings and shops at the centre.  There's the Mutknoga (phonetic) market.  In fact, there is a road that leads to that, but here there is a statue of the Virgin Mary and a small road that leads to the primary school located at that place. In summary, this is a photocopy of the sketch that I drew on the 25th of September 2004.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Pognon.
MR. POGNON:
I have reservations about this sketch, supposedly drafted by the witness himself, and as you will see, his representation of the site is very approximate, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.
MR. TOWNSEND:
I would disagree with counsel's representations and say that this is the witness's evidence, and it is relevant and it is therefore admissible.  None of his objections go to the inadmissibility of this document and it will aid the witness in presenting his testimony in a lucid fashion.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, you may proceed, Mr. Prosecutor, and you may use the document.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you very much.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness CNJ, referring to your diagram, what you've labelled église or church, can you tell us what is represented by this small plus or cross, if you can point to it?
A.	Here you see a plus sign.  I wanted to show the altar located within the church.  At the same time let me explain what I represent here.  This is the main entrance to the church, of course, before the church was destroyed.  The plus sign is approximately where the altar of the church was located.
Q.	Can you please take the pen that's in your hand, with red ink, and add to your sketch the tower of that church and label it T?
A.	I have finished.
MR. TOWNSEND:
For the record, Your Honour, the witness has drawn a T in the lower left-hand corner of the box labelled église or church and may the record so reflect.  I would also add that when the witness was explaining which were the front or principal, main doors of the church, he was pointing to the mark on that same square closest to the E in église or church and above what is now the T, if the record can so reflect.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness CNJ, you've referred to something as the statue of the Virgin Mary, which I think is referred to in the Kinyarwanda as Ishusho, I S-H-U-S-H-O.  Can you please label that with an I, or India? 
A.	I have done so.
Q.	Thank you.  And to the left of the "I" you have what is labelled "cooperative".  Can you label that and tell us if there is a name for that building?
A.	Kogakote (phonetic) is the name of that cooperative.
Q.	Did you draw this diagram alone or with the help of others?  Can you explain?
A.	I drew the sketch alone.  No one helped me to do so.  I base it on my own knowledge of the Nyange area.  This is how the centre looked before the war and even today.
Q.	Are you familiar with a kitchen at the Nyange presbytery?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you draw and add to your sketch and label with a C the kitchen at the Nyange parish?
A.	I have done so.
MR. TOWNSEND:
For the record, Your Honours, the witness has drawn a small box in which he's placed a red C which appears to the right of what is named presbytere or presbytery.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Question for the witness.  CNJ, what is behind the presbytery?
A.	Here there was a gate or fence, rather, there were trees, a hedge of trees, and then behind that there was some brush.  Here there was a fence, and this is the back courtyard.  We called it the back courtyard.  After the hedge there was some brush.
MR. TOWNSEND:
For the record, Your Honours, the witness has referred to an area of a rear enclosure as being below the presbytery, that is below the box labelled presbytere and the letters CNJ, CNJ.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	CNJ, at this time I would ask you to take your seat back at the witness stand.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Your Honours, at this time I would move to admit this sketch drawn by CNJ, labelled CNJ, and dated 25 September 2004, K0334649, as Prosecutor's Exhibit P. 25, 25.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Pognon, do you have any objection to the admission of this document?
MR. POGNON:
I had already expressed my reservations, Your Honours, and I stand by them.
Madam President, unless there's a decision rendered by the Chamber, we are in opposition to the admission of this document.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You oppose the admission of the document.
MR. POGNON:
Yes, we do.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber will admit this document bearing the reference K0334649, a document which was drawn by Witness CNJ, and it shall be marked P. 25, an exhibit from the Prosecution, and we shall, at a later date, assess the probative value of this document.  The Defence will cross-examine the witness in order to challenge the document.
 (Exhibit No. P. 25 admitted)
  MR. TOWNSEND:
      Thank you, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness CNJ, what did you see when you first arrived at Nyange on 15th April 1994?
A.	As soon as we reached Nyange there were obviously many Hutus armed with traditional weapons.  There were Tutsis who were throwing stones at those Hutus, who were also doing the same.  And there were some of the commune authorities present.  So those were the two groups that I saw as I arrived.
Q.	Can you tell us where you saw these authorities?
A.	When we arrived at the place where I said that was the Ishusho, in other words the statue of the Virgin Mary, there was a vehicle there, and that's where they received us.
Q.	Can you please name the authorities you saw present at that time and place?
A.	There was bourgmestre Ndahimana.  There was the IPJ Kayishema.  There was the teacher, known as Telephone Ndungutse.  There was a businessman known as Gaspard Kanyarukiga and then an entrepreneur known as -- he was known as in (unintelligible) Karage.  He was known normally Nbazimana but he was nicknamed Karage.
Q.	Did you hear any authority speak first at that time?
A.	Yes.
Q.	What did you hear, from whom?
A.	When we arrived on board the vehicle Kayishema welcomed us, and Bourgmestre Ndahimana also welcomed us and told us that we needed to cover ourselves with banana leaves so that we would be distinguished from the Tutsi.  He showed us where we were going to fetch the banana leaves from.  So one group went to the left and the other to the right, and Kayishema went before us to show us where we needed to go in order to attack.
Q.	Having heard those words, what did you do next?
A.	Since we had decided to go and fight the Tutsis, we cut the banana leaves and we followed Kayishema, who was showing us where we need to help the others in fighting the Tutsis.
Q.	Can you explain, very briefly, what happened during this stone throwing you mentioned?
A.	We went near the CARITAS restaurant, and that's where the Tutsis were coming down from the church and we were fighting them there.  We were repelled, and when we got close to Kanyarukiga's pharmacy, Kayishema asked us to go back up and throw stones at the Tutsis and one fearful Rukara went onto the roof of one of the buildings, and he told us to go up, and as we got further up he was preparing himself to throw the grenades.  We threw stones, and when Rukara was on the roof, the Tutsis repelled us, and when they repelled us, Rukara threw a grenade at them.
Q.	Do you recollect how many grenades or not?
A.	 He threw three grenades and those grenades killed those who were in the forefront, and we used that opportunity to pursue the others and kill them.
Q.	When you say you took the opportunity to pursue them, who is them?  Who did you pursue?
A.	I'm referring to the Tutsi whom we were fighting, the Tutsis who had sought refuge in the church.  They were trying to defend themselves and we, therefore, pursued them.
Q.	Did you carry anything in your hands?
A.	I had a club and sword at my belt.
Q.	Can you please estimate the number of Hutu attackers present at Nyange on the 15th of April 1994?
A.	They were many, but if I were to estimate their number, the Hutus were more than 4,000.
Q.	Can you please represent the number of Tutsi refugees gathered at Nyange April 15, 1994?
A.	When I estimate, I refer mainly to the persons who met their death on the 15th, so one can say that they were 2,000 in number.
Q.	How were you able to know the ethnicity of those refugees there?
A.	It was easy to know the ethnicity of those people, because from the 11th of April 1994 my uncle had come from a meeting in the commune -- at the commune, and he told us about the decisions they had taken; in other words that the Tutsis should be taken to the church, and that's one reason why I knew their ethnicity. 

Secondly, in the evening of 14th April someone who was my companion during those attacks -- prior to that we had committed massacres in Karataye (phonetic).  That person was together with Kayishema, and they asked the people to attack Nyange. 

Thirdly, we had started to kill on the 10th in the hills, and there were no more Tutsi on the hills, they had sought refuge at Nyange.  So it was very easy to go and fetch these people who were no longer in our commune on the hill, but they were in the same locality.
Q.	Who was the priest at Nyange church on April 15, 1994?
A.	It was Father Athanase Seromba.
Q.	Yes or no, did you see Seromba on April 15, 1994?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did you hear Seromba say anything?
A.	Yes, I heard him say something.
Q.	What words did you hear Seromba say on April 15, 1994?
A.	When we were pursuing the Tutsis, in other words after the grenades had been thrown, those Tutsis ran towards the church and the others went towards the presbytery.  When we were pursuing them in order to kill them, when we went after those who wanted to get into the presbytery, Father Seromba prevented us from entering and he told us, first of all, remove the dead bodies that were in front of the secretariat.  That's what I heard him say.
Q.	Where was Seromba standing when you heard him say those words?
A.	There's an entrance leading to the secretariat and there's an entrance leading to the back courtyard, and he was on the steps in front of that entrance.
Q.	To which bodies was Seromba referring when he said that?
A.	These were the Tutsis whom we were pursuing.  When they wanted to enter the presbytery there was a small door, and those who had gone into the church had closed the door behind them and the bodies were those of Tutsis whom we had killed and whom had not managed to enter the church or go into the back courtyard of the presbytery.
Q.	Can you please estimate the number of dead Tutsi bodies you saw at that time when you hear those words?
A.	Bodies were many, the people we had just killed numbered between 250 and 300.
Q.	What distance separated you from Seromba when Seromba said those words.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the interpreter is requesting the Prosecutor repeats that last question.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	What distance separated you from Seromba at the time you heard Seromba speak?
A.	It was about three metres.
Q.	On how many times did you see Seromba on 15th April 1994?
A.	I saw him once.
Q.	Can you estimate the time of day when you heard Seromba say those words?
A.	It was about 2 p.m.
Q.	Hearing Seromba say words to the effect, "First dispose of the bodies," what did you do?
A.	We removed the dead bodies, and afterwards we went into the back courtyard, the place where he was stopping us from entering before we removed the dead bodies.
Q.	Can you please describe the process of what happened in the removal of those bodies?
A.	A bulldozer had just come, in other words a mechanical shovel.  We removed the dead bodies.  We put them on to the shovel, and the bulldozer would take the dead bodies behind Cartas where there was a latrine.  That pit had been widened.
Q.	By what means was the pit widened?
A.	There was not only the single bulldozer, there was a second bulldozer which was used to widen the pit.
Q.	You mentioned you went inside the priests' enclosure.  Can you tell us what you saw?
A.	We went into the back courtyard.  We were many, and we took different directions.  And we went into the ground floor of the presbytery and in one room we found four to seven girls.  We were ready to kill them, and five gendarmes came and one of them told us not to kill the girls.
Q.	To which ethnic group did these four to seven girls belong?
A.	They were Tutsis.
Q.	Was it your understanding they were free to leave that room?
A.	I don't know.  We found them there.  We wanted to kill them.  We understood that they were refugees, but when the gendarmes prevented us from doing so, we left.
Q.	Do you know anyone by the name of Gatake?
A.	Yes, I know him.
Q.	How do you know him?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I do beg your pardon, Your Honours, we didn't get the name, please.  Can the Prosecutor be clearer with the name you've just mentioned, because Mr. Pognon didn't hear you.
MR. TOWNSEND:
It would be my pleasure.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness CNJ, can you tell us who was Gatake, G-A-T-A-K-E?
A.	Gatake was a Hutu who had come together with us; he accompanied us in the attacks.  He came from Ndaho in Kivumu commune.  He was among the attackers, and he was a Hutu.
Q.	Was he part of your group or not?
A.	I knew him because he was **********.
Q.	Did you hear Gatake say anything at that time?
A.	Yes.
Q.	What did you hear Gatake say?
A.	When we were prevented from killing the girls, I mentioned I met Gatake, whose hand was bleeding, and we were stopped from killing nine Inkotanyi, but the latter almost killed him as well (sic).
Q.	Where were you standing when you heard Gatake talking about this?
A.	We were still in the back courtyard opposite the door where Father Seromba was standing, in other words the door which leads to the secretariat.
Q.	I'm not sure if I got the words that Gatake said.  Can you just repeat them, slowly?
A.	He said to us, "I killed nine Inkotanyi, but they almost killed me, too."  And his hand was bleeding.  He told us that he had been wounded by a machete.
Q.	And when Gatake said Inkotanyi, to whom did you understand he was referring and he was targeting?
A.	It was quite understandable.  During that period of time we were killing Tutsis, and we referred to them as Inkotanyi-Inyenzi.
Q.	Upon seeing the injured bloody hand of Gatake, what did you do?
A.	When we realised that Gatake was wounded, we took him to Kanyarukiga's pharmacy.  He had promised to treat us free of charge.  That's where we took him for treatment.
Q.	Who made that promise?
A.	It was Kanyarukiga who was together with us through all these attacks, and he was the owner of that pharmacy.
Q.	While going towards the pharmacy of Kanyarukiga, did you hear anything in particular?
A.	When we went to Kanyarukiga's pharmacy there was someone who was yelling and they were saying that they had discovered some Inkotanyi.  Kanyarukiga was not with us, so he didn't say anything because he wasn't with us.
Q.	Do you recollect the words that you were hearing being yelled?
A.	They were saying, "We have just found Gatare, who was a very important person."
Q.	And when you heard those yelled words, what did you see?
A.	I stopped there.  I stopped accompanying Gatake to the pharmacy.  I turned around to see that person.  I came across a group of people.  They had taken Gatare and they had brought him to the inside courtyard right before the secretariat of the church.
Q.	Can you describe the condition in which you saw Gatare?
A.	He was already dead.  They were beating him with sticks.  They were beating the body with sticks.  His body was stripped naked.  The people who walked in front of the body threw stones at it.  Others were spitting at the body, and it was a naked body on the ground.
Q.	Where did you understand Gatare had been found by these attackers?
A.	He was in the presbytery hiding, but I don't know exactly where.  But what I do know is that the attackers took him from the presbytery, they brought him out through the secretariat door.
Q.	Where were you standing, if you can describe, when you made those observations?
A.	I told you that I turned around.  I was standing.  I wanted to know if he was still alive.  I noticed that he was already dead.  I did nothing else.  I saw that he was already dead.
Q.	My question is, where were you standing?
A.	I had just arrived at the road to the pharmacy when I heard the shouting.  I came back.  I was standing in front of the secretariat.  There was a small bridge near a tree not far from the secretariat, a small bridge not far at all from the church, in fact, and that's where I was standing.
Q.	Who was Gatare?
A.	Gatare was a Tutsi.  Before he died, he was a teacher.
Q.	Where was Seromba when you saw those events happen to the body of Gatare?
A.	I don't know.  I did not see Father Seromba there.
Q.	On 15 April 1994, can you estimate what time you left Nyange?
A.	Late in the evening at about 6:30.
Q.	I'd like you to turn your attention to the next day, Saturday, the 16th of April.  Where did you go on that day?
A.	On the 16th, in the morning, we returned to Nyange church.
Q.	When you say "we", to whom are you referring?
A.	Myself and my group, the group who had accompanied me the day before.  We went home together the previous evening, and we returned the next morning together, as well.
Q.	And what did you see upon your return to Nyange the morning of 16th April?
A.	We found many Hutus on site.  They had surrounded the church.  They were wearing banana leaves.  They were bearing traditional weapons.  Also, a bulldozer was parked to the left near the road to Kibuye, not far at all from the door which leads to the altar of the church.  There were also civilians who were there at the church.
Q.	Who did you see near the bulldozer?
A.	I saw many authorities.  I can give you an example, Anastase Rushema, who used to be a bourgmestre.  He quit that job.  There was Bourgmestre Ndahimana; the IPJ Kayishema, Fulgence; Telephone Ndungutse, the teacher; Kanyarukiga, Gaspard; Joseph Habiyambere, who in fact was the president of the Canton Court of Nyange; Vedaste Muragwabugabo, who was deputy bourgmestre; there was also Karage, Theodomere Mwabanjimana (phonetic).
Q.	You mentioned Joseph Habiyambere.  Had you seen him the day before or not?
A.	Yes, he was there.  Moreover, he was among the group of people who welcomed us near the statue.  In fact, when I mentioned the authorities who welcomed us I forgot to mention his name.  That all happened near the statue of the Virgin Mary
Q.	Now I'd like you to go back again to the 16th of September.  The authorities you've just mentioned, did you hear anything said by them at that time?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter apologises.  Would the Prosecutor repeat his question?
MR. TOWNSEND:
With pleasure.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Turning your attention to Saturday, the 16th of April 1994, you've mentioned some authorities as being present near the bulldozer.  Are you able to tell us if you heard anything said by any such authorities?
A.	On the 16th those authorities were near the bulldozer.  They were discussing how they should begin and where they should begin destroying the church.  They were discussing amongst themselves.
Q.	What distance separated you from those authorities during that discussion?
A.	I arrived and I joined their group.  I was very close.  I was less than one metre away.  I joined their group, in fact, in a manner of speaking.
Q.	Are you able to attribute particular words to anyone from that discussion and identify them, or not?
A.	I don't recall.  They where having a discussion,  the bourgmestre was speaking, Kayishema responded; Rushema was talking, Muragwabugabo gave his opinion; and so it's difficult for me to say who said what.  At any rate, the subject of the discussion was where they should begin to destroy the church.
Q.	What happened after that conversation or discussion?
A.	The police inspector, Kayishema, left the area and he went behind the church from the left side.  He was walking towards the back of the church close to the presbytery.  Five minutes later he came back, and he was with Father Seromba.  Father Seromba greeted the authorities who were standing next to the bulldozer.
Q.	Was anyone in the driver's seat of the bulldozer?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you tell us his name?
A.	One was nicknamed 2000.  His name was Anastase Nkinamubanzi.
Q.	Did you hear anyone say anything to the bulldozer driver?
A.	Yes, Kayishema gave the driver the order to begin.
Q.	What distance separated you from Kayishema when he gave that order?
A.	I was about two metres away, but I was a part of the group of authorities who were there.
Q.	Who else was present when Kayishema said those words?
A.	They were close to Father Seromba, who had come back with him.
Q.	Can you tell us what distance separated Kayishema from Seromba when Kayishema gave the order?
A.	They were very close to each other, 50 centimetres or less.
Q.	Did you hear Seromba say anything after Kayishema said those words on 16 April 1994?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Please tell us, to the best of your recollection, the words you heard Seromba say at that time.
A.	When Kayishema told the driver he could begin the driver began.  He started to drive the caterpillar into the wall.  Seromba said, "Watch out, make sure the wall doesn't fall on you."
Q.	To whom was Seromba speaking?
A.	He was speaking to the driver, the driver of the bulldozer.  He told him to back up so the wall would not fall on him.
Q.	To which wall was Seromba referring?
A.	The wall the bulldozer had just knocked down.  The wall was in the clutches of the bulldozer.  The bulldozer had not yet dumped the part the bulldozer had in its shovel.
Q.	And that wall belonged to which building?
A.	It was a brick wall, one of the walls of the church, and that's where he began to destroy the church.  He began, in fact, with that wall.
Q.	What distance separated you from Seromba when you heard those words?
A.	We had already backed up, but he was speaking loudly so that the people who were there could hear him speak.  The distance was less than three metres, the distance between us.
Q.	Can you estimate the distance between Seromba and the bulldozer driver himself at the time Seromba said those words?
A.	About four metres.
Q.	Can you estimate how much time elapsed between Kayishema speaking and Seromba saying those words?
A.	Kayishema spoke, and two minutes later Seromba also spoke.  That is when the driver began to follow the orders.
Q.	Did Kayishema do anything while he spoke?
A.	No, everyone moved back to watch.  They were watching the driver of the bulldozer.  After the wall came down the attackers went inside to finish off the people who weren't dead yet, to finish off those who were not killed by the falling bricks.
Q.	Can you estimate the time of day at which you heard Seromba say those words?
A.	It must have been between 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning.  That is when they began to destroy the church.
Q.	On the 16th of April, did you hear Seromba say anything else?
A.	I did not.
Q.	After saying those words, what did you see Seromba doing, if anything?
A.	Yes, I saw him do something else. 
Q.	Please explain what you saw?
A.	As the bulldozer was destroying the church wall and as people were moving, as the caterpillar moved forward, so the authority, too, moved forward.  Seromba followed the movements of the bulldozer.
Q.	Can you describe this process of destruction?
A.	The bulldozer approached the wall, first it was close to the door which led to the altar.  It picked up the wall and the wall fell toward the inside of the church.  Of course, the roof also came down, crashing down on the inside of the church.  People inside were crying, but of course some survived.  At the same time the attackers pounced on the survivors and killed them.  We tried to approach the inside of the church but the survivors were throwing stones back at us.  The bulldozer continued to pick up another wall which, would fall into the church.  That is how it all worked, and it continued in that way, the bulldozer continued with its work.

	1100H
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Did you go inside the church through the openings made by the bulldozer?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you describe what you saw happening on your moments inside the church, during its destruction?
A.	We went inside.  When we got there, there were people, and debris and bricks had fallen on top of them.  They weren't dead yet, but we finished them off with machetes, with machetes and other traditional weapons.  We also attacked many Tutsis who were hiding in the areas of the church that had not yet been destroyed.  Those people were using stones and bricks; they were throwing them at us.  We did not want to be wounded by that.  

After we finished those people off, the ones who were not dead yet, we waited for the bulldozer to destroy the other part of the church so that we simply had to finish off the others, the others who had still survived because the bricks had not yet come down on them on that part of the church.
Q.	Are you able to estimate the duration of time you saw Seromba present during those Caterpillar destructions and attacks inside the church on 16 April 1994?
A.	I think that he spent several hours there, but I do not know when he left the area.  I told you that the bulldozer began with the first door.  When it got to the second and third doors, Seromba was still there.  This was at around two o'clock in the afternoon.  I don't know when he finally left the area.
Q.	When you say the second and third doors of the church, to which side of the church are you referring if one is standing in front of the church facing the main front doors?
A.	There was a main entrance with a very large door, but on each side of the church and on the left-hand side of the church there were three doors.  There were also three on the other side.  The first was close to the altar.  There was a second and third door, but I'm not speaking about the entrance or the large door in front of the church.
Q.	What was the last part of Nyange church that was attacked?
A.	The last part of the church to be destroyed was the church tower.
Q.	What did you see happen to the church tower?
A.	The bulldozer had just destroyed the other parts of the church.  It cut the tower in two, but the tower did not fall towards the inside of the church; it fell the other way, towards the outside, towards the road to Kibuye.  Now, there were also people hiding within the tower.  They fell along with the tower.  Some of them died but some survived.  Those who survived, however, were finished off by the attackers.
Q.	Can you estimate at what time of day the church tower was knocked down on 16 April 1994?
A.	The tower came down at about 4 p.m.  At about 4 p.m., the work was almost done.
Q.	When you use the word "work" in that context, can you explain what you mean?
A.	I mean the killing, the killing of the Tutsis who had taken refuge at the church.  The killing of the refugees in the church was over.  The church was destroyed.  There were no more Tutsi survivors.  We had finished our work.  The plan was finished.  The plan was to kill all of the Tutsis who had taken refuge in that church.
Q.	What is your estimate of all those Tutsis that perished at Nyange parish on the 15th and 16th of April 1994?
A.	I mentioned this in the beginning.  I said that on those two occasions we killed some 2,000 Tutsis.
Q.	Where were you standing when the church tower fell?
A.	I was in the courtyard in front of the church, just in front of the secretariat building.
Q.	Of those Tutsi refugees that you saw fall with the tower, did you recognise any of them?
A.	I did.
Q.	Whom did you recognise?
A.	I recognised and identified the head of the Nyange medical centre.
Q.	How did that medical centre employee die?
A.	He was in the tower.  When the tower came down, he fell, but he did not die immediately.  Some of the Hutus who were there killed him.  They undressed him.  I even remember that he was wearing green coloured pants.
Q.	And to which ethnic group did that medical officer belong?
A.	He was Tutsi.
Q.	When the bulldozer was hitting the church tower, were there any efforts made by the refugees to defend themselves?
A.	Yes, as they did on the 15th.  On that day, they put up a fight.  They threw bricks at the bulldozer driver.  The assistant bourgmestre, Muragwabugabo, and other person whose name I do not recall were there.  Those people tried to protect the driver with a door as a shield against the stones that were being thrown.
Q.	Where was that door placed?
A.	The driver was in his seat.  Those two people surrounded him and held the door above his head as a shield against the incoming stones and bricks that were being thrown.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Your Honours, at this time I would ask that the curtains on this side of the courtroom be drawn and that Prosecution Exhibit 25, two-five, the sketch of this witness, be put on the projector to allow him to give some further clarifications.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, we'll take the 15-minute break now and we shall come back to that exercise in a moment.  This session is adjourned for 15 minutes.
(Court adjourned from 1115H to 1136H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The session is resumed.  Mr. Prosecutor, please proceed with the examination-in-chief of your witness. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you, Your Honours.  At this time, as I mentioned before, I ask that the witness step down from the witness stand, approach the projector on which is now displayed Prosecutor's Exhibit P. 25, 
two-five, the sketch.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Can the witness move to the overhead projector.  Is it P. 25? 
MR. TOWNSEND:
Yes, Your Honours, P. 25, the sketch. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness CNJ, I see that you are standing at the projector and what is your sketch.  I'd just like you to take the red pen that is there and please draw the point at which the bulldozer first struck Nyange church on 16 April 1994. 
A.	(Indicating).  The first part which was attacked by the bulldozer. 
Q.	Can you please label that with the number 1, please. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
For the record, Your Honours, the witness has used the red pen, and on the box identified "église," on the top side of that, there are three small door markings.  Above the most right-hand side door, he has made a mark and labelled it number 1 identifying the place where the bulldozer first hit, according to his evidence.  May the record so reflect. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, let it be so.  Please proceed, Mr. Prosecutor. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness CNJ, in your testimony, you referred to Seromba being present while the church (sic) hit the second and third doors on the left side of the church.  Can you number 2 and 3, respectively, those doors to which you were referring in your testimony, if they appear on your sketch.  I thank you, Witness.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
And for the record, the witness has labelled 2 and 3, so that now, on the top side of the box marked "église," moving from right to left, the three door markings are numbered 1, 2 and 3.  May the record so reflect.  And he's done so in red ink.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I cannot see very well.  There's 1 and 3, or is it 1, 3 and 2?  It is 1, 2 and 3, is it?
MR. TOWNSEND:
Yes, moving from right to left, 1, 2, 3.  They are in order, sequential, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, it is sequential.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness, can you please draw a small box and label it with "B," as in boy, to show the location of where you saw the bulldozer upon your arrival on the 16 April 1994.  I thank you, Mr. Witness. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
For the record, Your Honours, the witness, using his red pen, has drawn a small rectangle in which he has placed a small "B," as in boy, to the left of the number 1; in other words, between 1 and 2 on his diagram, if the record may so reflect.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we've taken due note of that, Mr. Prosecutor.  Please continue. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you very much, Your Honours. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	You referred, Mr. Witness, to a pit into which bodies were placed on 15 April 1994 that was widened by a bulldozer.  Can you show that and draw it and add that to your diagram, please. 
MR. POGNON:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr.  Pognon. 
MR. POGNON:
I do not know whether the witness spoke about a latrine.  I don't know.  Maybe I was distracted, but I do not remember him speaking about a latrine into which bodies were thrown.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness stated that a latrine had been widened and that it was therefore in that pit that the bulldozers threw the dead bodies.  I think you'll find that in the transcripts of today, Counsel.  

Please proceed, Mr. Prosecutor. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness, can you please put the letter "P," as in Peter, inside that form or shape you've drawn.  Thank you. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
The witness has drawn a circle in red ink into which he's placed a letter "P," for Peter, appearing on his sketch approximately between the restaurant CARITAS and the secretariat, if the record may so reflect.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I have not understood.  You must repeat the exercise.  There seems to be a problem.  We're speaking of latrines and now I heard the word "restaurant."  P, what does P represent in the end?  We've lost you. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
Your Honour, I've asked him to place a "P," for pit, in English, as the space where the bulldozer dug a pit in an existing latrine on the 15th of April 1994.  It is a circle in which a "P," for Peter, appears.  That circle to aid the record appears between two locations, one being the secretariat, the second being the restaurant CARITAS.  If the record may so reflect.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  That is clear now.  What we heard was not exactly the same. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness, looking at your sketch, in the area shown by your sketch, does that area show any place where bananas are grown that belong to the Nyange parish; yes or no?
A.	I did not talk about the banana field in question.  Nevertheless, that banana field does exist. 
Q.	Fair enough.  Can you tell me if there's one banana field or more than one?
A.	It is a field with one banana field in it.
Q.	Can you please mark that with an "X" on your diagram, please.  If you can make it rather large, please. 
A.	I would place the banana field here (indicating).  Nevertheless, there was another banana field close to a place where bamboo grew; however, I do not know if that belonged to the church.  I don't know.
Q.	Could you please label that area where you've placed an "X" as bananeraie.  Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
For the record, using the same red pen next to the X which appears on the lower right-hand side of his sketch, the witness has written the word "bananeraie," in French, to reflect the banana field belonging to Nyange church.  

That's my last question -- if the record may so reflect -- with regard to the sketch.  If the record may so reflect, Your Honours.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Let the record so reflect the large X on the sketch depicts the location of the banana field. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I'm done with Prosecution Exhibit 25 for the moment.  If the witness can return to the stand, the curtains be opened, and I have just a few more questions. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness CNJ, to conclude with the 16th of April 1994, can you estimate the time that you left Nyange on 16 April 1994?
A.	I left the area at around 4 p.m.
Q.	How many minutes would you say you left after the tower had fallen?
A.	After the tower fell, 20 minutes later I left.  The Tutsis had been killed and the tower came down.  We noticed there were no more Tutsis to kill and we left.
Q.	In what circumstances did you meet Seromba?
A.	I knew Seromba because I used to go to mass.  At the time I was still a believer of the Catholic Church.
Q.	At which church did you celebrate those masses?
A.	I went to Nyange church before it was destroyed.
Q.	How many times would you estimate that you saw Seromba before 16 April 1994?
A.	That would be difficult for me to count.  At any rate, it's more than 20 times, just going by the number of times I went to mass at that parish.
Q.	Have you seen Seromba since 16 April 1994?
A.	No, I haven't seen him, but I've seen him today, here.
Q.	Witness CNJ, can you please stand up if you need to and point at the person who you are telling us now that you recognise as Father Seromba, the same one you've referred to in your testimony. 
A.	I've seen him.  He's there (indicating).  He's the second person, starting with that man there.  We're looking at one another.  His jacket looks like it's khaki.  It looks like he has a white shirt on.  He's the second person, beginning over here, and he's the third if you begin with the other side. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
For the record, Your Honour, I would offer that CNJ has just stood, pointed, positively identified Seromba, understanding the fact that he's the only one wearing that colour blazer and having identified him as sitting in the first row, two from the left, three from the right.  May the record so reflect.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
May the record reflect that the witness has identified the Accused in the courtroom.  You may sit down, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Mr. Prosecutor.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you very much, Your Honours. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness CNJ, on what date were you arrested?
A.	It was on a Friday, the ************** 1997.  On that day I was arrested.
Q.	Do I understand correctly that you have been in detention continuously since that day in Rwanda?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Have you been sentenced yet or tried in Rwanda?
A.	No.
Q.	Have you been categorised under Rwandan law regarding genocide?
A.	Yes, after my confession and after I requested pardon, the prosecutor's office placed me in the second category.
Q.	You mentioned confession.  Have you given one written confession or more than that?
A.	There were many documents that I've given.  I did not confess immediately.  That is because of the conditions of my life at the time.  I didn't remember everything at the time.  But gradually, as I remembered things, I gave the details, and so indeed there are more than four documents containing my confession.
Q.	Do you recollect when you first gave your first confession?
A.	It was on the ********** 1998.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Your Honours, at this time I have only two questions remaining, and I would ask that we move at this time for a closed session, as these two questions relate to matters which would identify the witness if we were to remain in open court.  So to protect his identity, I would so move at this time, Your Honour, and then I will be done with my direct examination.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Pognon, Mr. Monthé, any objections?
MR. POGNON:
No objections.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, no objections.  We shall now move into closed session in the interests of justice and to protect the identity of this witness.  We apologise to the members of the public. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 27 to 31] was extracted and filed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

(Court resumed at 1440H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
These proceedings are resumed.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  Mr. Pognon, are you prepared to continue with your cross-examination of this witness?
MR. POGNON:
Yes, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  You have the floor.  Earlier, we were in closed session, and now we are in open session.  If you need a closed session, Counsel, you perhaps may ask for that later on. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel's microphone, please. 
MR. POGNON:
Yes.  I simply wanted to advise the Chamber that the Accused does not feel well and he is in the back room for the time being.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  You may proceed.  We have asked to see if he needs medicine, and if so, we can alert the doctor. 
MR. POGNON:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Witness CNJ, good afternoon. 
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	Now that we are in open session, I'd like to put a first question to you.  Please tell us, Witness, at what time exactly you arrived to the church on that Friday. 
A.	I was not wearing a watch.  I do remember that it was between eleven o'clock in the morning and 
1 p.m.
Q.	Upon your arrival, Witness, what did you find there at the scene?
A.	As I said earlier, there were some people there.  There were many Hutus bearing traditional weapons, and they were wearing banana leaves.  They were in a stone fight with the refugees.  They had come down.  They were near the main road.  Authorities were also there, also close to the main road, and they came to greet us.
Q.	You arrived on site and there was a confrontation going on; is that correct?  When you arrived, had the confrontation already begun or did it begin after your arrival?
A.	On Friday, the 15th of April, when I arrived, the confrontation had already begun.
Q.	Very well.  Had some people already been killed?
A.	No, I didn't see anyone who had been killed, but I did see the two groups throwing stones at one another.  I could see that the Tutsi refugees were stronger than the Hutu group.
Q.	You arrived on site and the groups were throwing stones at one another.  Please describe for us, Witness, what the scene was upon your arrival before you began to participate in the fight.  Where were the refugees?
A.	Many Tutsis were at the church.  The Hutus attacked them in order to kill them.  The Tutsis were trying to defend themselves and push the Tutsis back towards the road.  The Tutsi group was above, and you could see that there was a stronger group, and when we wanted to attack them, Kayishema came up to us near the restaurant, the restaurant that I've indicated.  After that, we started to fight the Tutsis again, and another group of reinforcements showed up in the meantime.
Q.	Witness, you say another group arrived.  You said that there were 4,000 of you, and so when you say "another group," how were you able to make a distinction that there was another group that arrived, given that large crowd of people?
A.	During the fight, sometimes we would push the Tutsis past the CARITAS restaurant and sometimes they pushed us back.  When the vehicles dropped us off, it didn't stop there.  They continued bringing people to the site.  Even from Kibilira, another group came from Kibilira and that group arrived at about 2 p.m.  We could tell that it was a very strong group.  After that, we realised that the Tutsi group was stronger than we were, stronger than all of us.
Q.	How long did the fight last after the grenades were thrown?
A.	The fight lasted about one hour; 60 minutes, in other words.
Q.	You said that on that Friday, Witness, you arrived between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Can you be more specific for us?  Because between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., there's a two-hour interval.  Was it closer to 11 a.m. or was it closer to 1 p.m. when you arrived?
A.	I cannot give you a specific time because before I went to Nyange in the morning, we caught a Tutsi.  We brought him to the Nyabarongo river, and so from the Nyabarongo up until when we found a vehicle, it must have been past eleven o'clock in the morning.  That is why I didn't want to give you a specific time.  I simply said that I arrived between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. because before we got to Nyange church, we had left to throw someone in the Nyabarongo river.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  There was a grenade attack.  How long after that attack did the fight last?
A.	We tried to kill the Tutsis all day long.  After the grenades were thrown, fighting continued, and in the 20 minutes that followed the grenade attack, we had already killed all of the people who were not able to get to the presbytery and all the people who were not able to get inside the church.  And as we were waiting for the bulldozer to bury the dead, we tried to knock the church door down to get inside to kill those who were inside.  So in summary, the fighting continued into the evening.  The fighting continued up until the evening and continued even until the next day.
Q.	Witness, you've just said that after the grenades were thrown, you took 20 minutes to exterminate all the Tutsis who were there.  If that is indeed the case, how could the fighting continue?  How could it continue up until the evening?  What else did you do?  What else did you do so that the fighting would have to continue up until the evening?
A.	I said that after the grenades were thrown, those who were not able to flee to the presbytery or inside the church were killed by us, and that in 20 minutes.  But others had taken refuge inside the church and others in the presbytery.  After all the bodies in front of the secretariat were taken away, we continued to try to kill those who were inside the church.  That is why I am telling you that Gatake was killed, for example, at the presbytery.  Gatake was wounded.  The attackers tried to burn down the church using gasoline.  They used dynamite to try to destroy the church.  There were also people hiding in the tower and they were throwing bricks at us.  During that entire time, we tried to gain access into the church to kill people who were inside.

	1500H
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Let's talk about the scene at the presbytery.  You said that, at first, Father Seromba prohibited you from coming into the presbytery and sent you back to, first, bury the dead bodies; is that correct, Witness?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Let's now talk about the burial of those bodies.  Practically speaking, what did you attackers do in order to bury the bodies; what exactly in practical terms did you do?
A.	The bodies were all over the ground and we intended to kill all of the people inside, and Father Seromba asked us, first, to remove those bodies, so, first, we had to remove them.  I told you we buried them, because after the bulldozer arrived we lifted up the bodies and threw them into the mechanical shovel so that the bulldozer could bury those same bodies into the pit.  The bulldozer would come back.  We would put more bodies in the shovel and the bulldozer would carry them away, et cetera, et cetera.
Q.	When did the bulldozer arrive, Witness?
A.	The bulldozer arrived at about 2:30 p.m. That is when ************* went to bring the bulldozer.  It was between 2:30 p.m. and 3:30 p.m.
Q.	Who made the request for the bulldozer?
A.	Father Seromba told us that we had to remove the bodies.  We were with Kayishema and Rushema.  They went down to tell ********* who was further behind.  In fact, he was close to the pharmacy.  *********** had a vehicle that had been confiscated from him -- that had been confiscated and he went to look for that vehicle and then they went to fetch the bulldozer.  Kayishema brought the bulldozer.  I don't know where ********* was.
Q.	After the bodies were buried, how did you get back into the presbytery, as you said you did?
A.	The problem was solved.  Then we went into the presbytery.  Nobody barred us access to the presbytery, so we went inside to look for the people we were looking for.  Nobody tried to stop us.
Q.	Who did you find in the presbytery?
A.	We found five gendarmes.  The Hutu group dispersed in different directions, some went through the kitchen, and that is how we all got into the presbytery.
Q.	Now, how many people did you kill at the presbytery?
A.	Personally, as I told you, we wanted to kill the girls that we found there, and inside there were five or six girls, but the gendarmes stopped us and when we were about to go out, we met one, Gatake, who told us that he had just killed nine people.
Q.	Thank you.  Did you see those nine people killed by Gatake?
A.	As he was wounded, we didn't bother to go to the place at which he killed them.  We understood that he killed them because we were all there to kill, so that we just took him to the pharmacy because he was certainly wounded.
Q.	So, Witness, as far as that attack at the presbytery was concerned -- that is, following the burial of the bodies -- you only know through Gatake, that he killed nine people; is that correct?
A.	After having killed the nine people, and after having been taken to the pharmacy, there was an alert sounded, according to which, one, Gatare, had been found.  He was found at the presbytery and he was taken out and he was -- his clothes were taken off and, as far as the other people were concerned that were killed, I cannot say anything about them.  I know that at that particular time they started burning down the church.
Q.	Now, when you went into the presbytery to kill those that were in there, did you see Father Seromba in the presbytery?
A.	No, sir, I did not see him.
Q.	Now, let's come back -- or let's move on to Saturday, that is the 16th -- 16th of April.  At what time did you arrive at the church on the 16th April, Saturday?
A.	I arrived very early in the morning, sir.  We arrived between 8:30 a.m. and 9 a.m., sir.
Q.	At what location did you find -- when you arrived, did you go to Ishusho or you went directly to the church?
A.	We immediately went to the church because we wanted to continue the work we had started the day before at the church.  Let me remind you that on the 15th of April some people were guarding the refugees that had survived, so that we had to go on with the rest of the work, that it be started on Saturday, sir.
Q.	Now, in practical terms -- Witness, in practical terms, when you got there what did you do, Witness?  In view of this prospect of continuing the work that you started, what did you do in practical terms?
A.	As we hadn't finished work we started on Friday -- in the meantime we were waiting for the bourgmestre because after having welcomed us he went to his ********-- that is, his secteur, his own secteur -- because he was to bury a close relative of his.  When we arrived -- when we ceased work on Friday, we were told that there were no longer any bullets, we had to wait for Saturday and the authorities were talking to one another.  They were discussing as to which location they were to start with.
Q.	Do you mean that when you arrived, Witness, the bourgmestre was not yet there and that it was after your arrival that the bourgmestre arrived; is that correct?
A.	No, sir; I found him there.
Q.	Very well.  So you're simply referring to the day before; is that correct?
A.	Very well.  The day before we found him there.  He welcomed us there but, having welcomed us, when the fighting started we went to ********.  He went when the fighting was at its peak, as he went back to his own secteur, his secteur of origin, in other words.
Q.	Yes.  You said that when you arrived you realised that people were talking about the destruction of the church.  Is that correct?  Now, could you tell us, precisely -- could you tell us simply -- could you give us an idea of what you heard and from whom did you hear what you heard?
A.	I do not remember precisely what such-and-such a person said.  But I do remember one Mugabo (phonetic) who was assistant to the bourgmestre, who was proposing that if the Caterpillar was able to break through the church, then the attackers could have access to the church, but he did not understand why people should risk their lives by getting into the church.  The Tutsis that were in the church were very hostile.  He was -- he couldn't understand why people should risk their lives getting into the church.  So when they said that -- they said that it was -- Seromba was coming, that was to decide as to whether the church was going to be totally destroyed or whether he had another solution, to enable people to get into the church, to have access to those people inside the church.
Q.	Now, let me remind you that -- this is the first time you are giving us this inkling, these ideas.  What do you mean, the discussions you heard; the discussions you heard -- the discussions you heard -- according to you, what you heard, it was decided that one would wait for Seromba in view of the dangers that there were, that one would leave to Seromba.  Why should one leave it to Seromba?  Did you know why -- the reasons why Seromba was to be awaited?
A.	Thank you for your comment.  You are saying that this is the first time that you hear of me talking about this particular thing, but everything that happened in Nyange -- it is not quite easy to remember everything that happened in Nyange and to record all the events in a statement or in a document.  People were saying, "Are we going to destroy the church?  Are we going to break through the door?  Are we going to make a hole on the wall to go in?"  And during these discussions one said that, "Let us wait for Seromba and when Seromba comes, in consultation with him, we will decide what to do.  If we are to destroy a low part of the church, even if it was to be repaired subsequently, or if the entire church was to be destroyed."
Q.	Let me put down on record that this is the first time that this discussion is made by the witness.  Now, you said, Witness, that people were talking.  You cannot remember what they said, but you have just given us the essence or the gist of what they said.  You mentioned somebody who was talking, who was putting forth the equation.  What was the name?  You said a name.  I did not retain it.  I didn't hear it properly.  What was the name that you mentioned?
A.	Vedaste Muragwabugwabo.  Now, as to the fact that this is the first time I am developing -- making this discussion, since you were not there to know what was happening, if I say that I do not remember everything that was said, I've just told you what Muragwabugwabo said and the opinion of the bourgmestre.  At any rate, all those people that were there had something to say.  I cannot remember everything that they said.  It is quite natural that I couldn't remember what everyone said.  They were all talking to one another.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, the group of eight that you were, eight attackers that you were, that criss-crossed the country killing and putting -- throwing bodies into the river Nyabarongo, did some of your attacking partners accompany you, or were you just alone?
A.	Well, some of those attackers -- most of them were with me all the time.  Unfortunately, today most of my partners are no longer alive.  They all died.
Q.	They died there, or did they die later?
A.	They died later.  Some died in exile; others died in detention.
Q.	Do you mean that today, as of this date, that is, your partners in arms, so to speak, are not here, none of them is here, to corroborate what you have just said?  Is that correct?
A.	Among the eight that it is a question of, two -- only two are still alive.  According to what I know, one of them is in detention in Kigali and the other is in detention at the same location as I am in detention, but he did not want to make any confessions, so that to date I don't know whether he is in a position to corroborate what I've said.  Because, in spite of the fact that he is being accused of certain things, he has refused, he has resisted, confession.   He has refused to confess, sir.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, you said earlier on, concerning a question put to you by the prosecutor, that it was Kayishema that went to fetch Seromba; is that correct?
A.	Yes, sir.
Q.	Now, when Kayishema went to fetch Seromba, concerning the issue at hand at the time, and since you were in that particular location, did you hear what Seromba said in terms of fetching somebody?
A.	All I know, sir, is that after the arrival of Seromba it was said that the driver could start breaking down the church.  When Seromba arrived with Kayishema, I greeted them.  The bourgmestre said, "Now we can start", and then, later on, Kayishema said aloud, he spoke loudly enough for us to hear -- Kayishema was talking to the driver.  He told him, "Now you can start."
Q.	Well, then, Seromba was brought over.  He arrived, and it was the bourgmestre who was the first one to say, "Let us now start."  Is that correct?
A.	As I said, they were talking to one another in a group among themselves, and Seromba arrived.  The bourgmestre said to his colleagues, "Look, now I think we can start.  We all agreed."  Then Kayishema said, "Now you can start".  The bourgmestre, firstly, talked to his colleagues, and then Kayishema spoke out loud to the driver and told the driver that he may now start.
Q.	Now, does that mean that you did not once hear Seromba say something and that it was his arrival that allowed the bourgmestre to say, "We can now start", and Kayishema says to the driver, "Now you may start."  Is that correct that Kayishema told driver --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor.
MR. POGNON:
May the witness answer, Your Honour?  Probably there is an objection.  An objection will deflect the purpose of my question.  I pray that my colleague should allow the witness to answer, lest he may deflect the purpose of my question.  I am chronologically following the answers of the witness.  I am questioning on that basis.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, would you like to make your objection without suggesting anything to the witness?

MR. POGNON:
That is not possible, Your Honour.  That is not possible.
MR. TOWNSEND:
My objection is that this question misstates the testimony.  It is inadmissible as such.  He should reformulate.
MR. POGNON:
If it is merely that, I am most obliged.  I shall reformulate.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may reformulate.
MR. POGNON:
Let me reformulate.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	I am referring faithfully to what you said.  You arrived at that location.  There was discussions as to whether the church should be broken down or not.  The problems that may arise -- it was certain one, Vedaste, was talking and it appeared that it was necessary to go and fetch Seromba.  Kayishema went to fetch Seromba.  Seromba came and upon arrival -- upon his arrival, the bourgmestre said, "Now we may destroy the church."  Kayishema says to the driver, "Now you may start."  This is what you have said.  Now, my question is as follows -- my question is as follows: the concerns of those who tried to break down the church required that they resort -- according to you, they resort to Seromba, that they call upon Seromba; is that correct?  Now, Seromba arrived.  Now I put to you the question as to what he said subsequently.  You said that the bourgmestre said that he -- that they may start, and Kayishema relayed the message to the driver.  Now, my question is: now, does that mean that it was the mere presence of Seromba, without even having said anything -- because you didn't say anything that he said or he didn't say -- it was the mere presence of Seromba that triggered the bourgmestre's reaction and Kayishema's reaction as to the destruction of the church?  Could you answer me?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
An objection, Prosecutor?
MR. TOWNSEND:
Same objection: misstates the testimony; needs to be reformulated.  There's more evidence from the testimony than "mere presence", if I can make it clear.
MR. POGNON:
Your Honour, Madam President -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you objecting to the objection?
MR. POGNON:
I will not react to the objection, Your Honour.  I am simply faithfully reflecting what is said here.  If you can look at the transcript, you will see.  And my worry is as follows: Seromba was brought over because it was said that Seromba should be brought over because he wants to trigger the events.  Now, my question is what did Seromba say to trigger the operations.  Was it he or Nahimana (sic) or Kayishema?  What did Seromba say and -- I'm being accused of not faithfully reflecting the utterances we have heard here.  I can get the transcripts, and the answers to the questions -- the answers to the questions of the prosecutor himself.
JUDGE KAM:
Yes, I believe that the problem is that you are asking the witness about his -- witness -- concerns his opinion, concerning the triggering of the operation.
MR. POGNON:
It is not an opinion I am seeking.  It is not an opinion that I'm seeking.  We were in a discussion, Your Honour, in a discussion.  A discussion started on that Saturday morning.  The discussion, according to the witness statement here -- he gave us the substance of the discussions, and he said that it took one to fetch Seromba.  Now, Seromba arrived.  Now, what I want to know is what did Seromba say.  Now, according to him, Seromba did not say anything.  He just arrived and then the bourgmestre said something and Kayishema said something.  What did Seromba say?  It would appear to me that it's the mere presence of Seromba.  This is not a prod -- this is not an opinion.  I'm not interpreting anything.  I am just revealing the answers of the question.  This is -- I mean, the witness -- this is not an opinion.
JUDGE KAM:
As you said, sir, according to statements, Father Seromba did not say anything.  This is what you are saying.  Is that correct?
MR. POGNON:
Thank you.  Had he told me that Father Seromba did not say anything, I would have stopped.
JUDGE KAM:
This is what I understood you to have been saying.
MR. POGNON:
At any rate, up to this present time, according to my notes, he is not saying that he heard anything from Seromba.  The other witnesses, the other persons that were there -- Vedaste, for example -- said something.  But up to this time he didn't say that Seromba said anything, sir.  He did not say so.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Pognon, could you put your question without making any recapitulations?  Could you put your questions in a straightforward manner? 
MR. POGNON:
That is very difficult, Your Honour, but I can try.  I shall put forth my question.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Now, when Father Seromba arrived at the group, after having greeted one and all, what did he say?
A.	Thank you.  As a matter of fact you were distorting my statement there.  I did not say that it was necessary for us to go and fetch him.  It was clear that he was late in coming, and they were saying that when he arrived they would continue the discussions.  It was -- he was late.  They didn't go to fetch him and when he arrived, there was evidently a -- he was simply late.  He was simply late, and then the discussions went on, along the same lines, on the same issue.  He was simply late.
Q.	Thank you.  Thank you.  Now, sir, since it was not necessary for him to be (unintelligible), what did he say when he arrived?  What did he say?  Did you hear him say anything?
A.	As he was a very respected person in that area -- he was one of the authorities in the commune -- and since the church that was to -- that was to be destroyed, the church in which he officiated, he appeared as though he was the one to authorise the destruction of the church.
Q.	It would appear; it would appear.  I indeed note that.  Thank you very much.  Now, was Seromba the only priest in the presbytery at that particular time?
A.	Yes, he was the one I saw on that day, somebody known in that area.  I didn't go there to seek to know who the other priests were in that area.  I only saw Seromba, sir.
Q.	You said that that was your parish.  Do you know whether there were other priests in the parish at the time of the event, or was Seromba alone; was he the only one in the parish at that time?
A.	There were others.  There were -- there was our priest.  I knew him by sight only.  But during the killings of the Tutsi, I did not see him.  I did not see that particular priest.
Q.	Apart from him, there was no one else, was there, at the parish?
A.	It's difficult to know the employees of the parish, given the huge crowd that was there.  I didn't go to that place in order to find out about the presence or otherwise of the employees of the parish.  I'm speaking only about the person that I saw.  I'm not going to be saying that this or that employee was there or not.
Q.	In fact, I'm not talking about employees; I am speaking about the clergy.  Can you tell us whether there was any other priests, apart from Seromba, on that day because you say this was your parish?
A.	What I said is that even on the 15th I didn't see that priest, but I knew that there was a priest who assisted Seromba.  Now, as for the day of the 15th, there were serious offences committed in the location and, as a true clergy, he should have said this or that, or he could have gone to hide somewhere so that he can avoid being a witness of those events, in my opinion.
Q.	Thank you.  I wasn't asking for as much.  First of all, in your capacity as a Catholic individual, you were raised a Catholic.  Were you ever told or did you get to know how one gets to build a church?
A.	No.
Q.	Since you were a practising Catholic, until then, before we go any further than that, when you went to church, were you making any inquiries -- were there any collections made?
A.	Yes, I think that did happen and I think I gave a contribution of 15 francs per year.  The practice was not similar to that of the Protestant church.  We would make a contribution, an annual contribution to the church.
Q.	Did you mean to say that there was no collection after mass, for instance, on Sundays?
A.	At the time when I would go to mass, all the times that I attended mass there was no collection made, unless this is a practice that came about later on, but at the time there was no collection every Saturday or every Sunday or every week.
Q.	Thank you.  In your view, according to you, does the church -- in other words, the building, does that seem to you like something which belongs to Seromba?
A.	No, this was not his private property but, given the fact that we were living through a period of war, he was the person responsible for the Nyange parish.  As for the building itself and other things which went on there, he, himself, was responsible because he was the leader of the parish.
(Pages 35 to 42 by Verna Butler)




























	1545H
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Are you saying that because he seemed to you to be in charge of the parish?  Is that why you're saying that he gave the authority for the church to be destroyed?
A.	No.  Even in the incidents that we saw it was obvious.  He didn't have any pity for the Tutsis.  We saw that he was cooperating with us and we were killing the Tutsis, Tutsis who had come to seek refuge at the church.  We cooperated with him in all these acts of killings.  He as the person in charge of the place, he was one of the people who was working with us, especially in the killings that took place on the 16th.  I am basing my opinion on his conduct during the genocide, especially on the 15th and the 16th. 
Q.	You're saying he was cooperating.  Did he ever give instructions to the attackers to go and kill?
A.	I want to explain the following to you: when he told us to remove the bodies, that was on the 15th to start with, and when we waited for him on the 16th, and he came, and we continued with this job -- gradually as the bulldozers demolished the building, he would be observing how the job was being done and this, to me, gives me the impression that he had adopted a kind of conduct.  He had stopped us from going into the presbytery.  On that day had he taken an opposite decision, that decision could have been accepted.  We could see that he was working together with the authorities.  When the church was being brought down upon the refugees, he was following up on what was being done to demolish the church and this is what makes me say what I'm saying now, given his behaviour at the time. 
Q.	You stated that during the demolition he was merely observing, he approached.  Please describe to us the atmosphere that was prevailing while the destruction was ongoing?
A.	It was a critical situation.  I'm speaking about the Tutsis that were being killed.  They had sought refuge in the church on Friday.  We were unable to enter the church itself.  And on Saturday when the church was to be destroyed the Hutus were very happy.  Each time part of the roof fell on the Tutsis, who were defending themselves using stones, it could be heard that the Hutus were shouting.  They were very happy and they showed their satisfaction.  So as and when the bulldozers were demolishing part of the walls, that was how Seromba came forward together with the other people, the other authorities, who visibly manifested their joy at that destruction.
Q.	I'm talking about during the destruction.  Whilst the bulldozers were destroying the church, how far away was Seromba who you claim was present at the time?  How far away was he from the bulldozers which were carrying out the destruction?
A.	I'm going to give you an example.  You see the wall here in front of us, the wall opposite me; that would be the walls of the church.  Now, for fear that the wall would fall on someone, people had placed themselves at a certain distance; in other words, let's say behind me the bulldozers were destroying the church, and as it moved forward, the people would follow.  The bulldozers came in at the place where there had been an opening made, so Seromba was with the authorities and all the while he was close to the place which was going to be destroyed.
Q.	Can you give us an estimate of the number of attackers who were there on that day?
A.	This question was put to me by the prosecutor and I said the estimate of those people would be more than 4,000.  I think they could even have reached the figure of 10,000, but I am using the figure of 4,000 given the number of Tutsis who were there.  I believe the attackers were twice as many as the Tutsis.  I believe there could have been at least two assailants per Tutsi being pursued.
Q.	I'm talking about the demolition once again.  Was there any noise?
A.	Yes, there was excessive noise.  There were those who were crying and who were moaning within the church; those who were on the point of dying; and then there was the ceiling, the roof which was caving in; there were Hutus who were shouting as parts of the wall were falling on the unfortunate victims.
Q.	You are saying that the walls made a noise as they fell.
A.	Yes.  Each time a wall fell, it would fall down with part of the roofing and there were also the tiles which were falling, so every time something fell there would be a noise.  There were walls which were more than 60 centimetres thick and each time the Hutus would acclaim the destruction of parts of the building at the same time the Tutsis were crying within the church.  So there was a lot of noise at the time. 
Q.	Was there a great deal of dust?
A.	Yes, that's obvious because the walls and -- which were made of brick, which were falling, necessitated the presents of dust.
Q.	So there's the noise from the Caterpillars, the noise from the walls crumbling down, the shouts of the people, and there's dust, and you say that in that commotion and death -- you are saying you claim that Seromba and the authorities were following the bulldozers; is that what you want to make us understand?
A.	Yes, yes, indeed.  I -- you mentioned a commotion.  Yes, when the walls were falling there was dust.  When the bulldozer would withdraw to the back, and the assailants would enter, in order to finish off the persons who were on the point of dying, and when they came out, the bulldozers would go forward again, so it was quite easy -- possible for me to see Seromba and the other authorities as they came forward, as well as the attackers who surrounded the church so that they can stop the Tutsis from leaving the church and go elsewhere. 
Q.	Where were you?  How far were you given that commotion that was ongoing?
A.	At that time, when all this was happening, I think I was inside the church.  When I came out from the church, I followed the group, the group behind those who were near the bulldozers, and each time the wall was broken down, we would go to the part which had not been destroyed.  I knew all these people so I wasn't afraid of them and I would be able to approach.
Q.	Very well.  So it's in this huge commotion that you claim you heard Seromba speaking to the driver; is that what you said?
A.	No, please don't mix up things.  Seromba had said to the drivers -- but that was even before any of the walls came tumbling down.  When he had told them to be careful he hadn't yet told them to begin.  He was saying, "Be careful so that the walls don't fall upon you".  It is true there was noise, but at that point in time none of the walls had fallen as yet.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, let me turn to what you said during the gacaca sessions, your confessions.  You made a confession on the ******************** 1998.  I'm just looking for this so I can find the page.  Excuse me one moment.  Let me find the page.  On that date --
MR. POGNON:
I wish to give the page number to the Judges.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	It is your statement of *************** 1998.  I think what I require can be found on page 2, page 2 of your confession statement. 
MR. POGNON:
Yes, here we are.  I do apologise.  It is page K0335018.  This is the statement of confession made by the witness.  Let me read page -- it is the statement of confession of ************** 1998.  The date is illegible and the subject is "Supplementary information for the file containing the statements of confession of ************** 1998".  It's document 2410 bis, which is in handwriting at the top of the page.  And the page K-reference number is K0335017 in the French.  The date is illegible and the subject matter is "Supplementary information for the confession statements made on ************* 1998".  May I proceed? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please go ahead.  We're with you. 
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	So the date is ****************** 1998.  On that page, 2410 bis -- 2409 bis, K-reference is K0335018.  The last paragraph on that page.  Let me read: 

"During the destruction of Nyange church the communal authorities had called for the help of all the members of the population; in other words, the inhabitants."  Did you make that statement, Witness, on ************* 1998?
A.	This letter was not written on the *********** 1998, Counsel. 
Q.	This document was disclosed by the Prosecutor and it was stated that the date was illegible but your name appears.  I can't say out your name.  And the subject is, "Supplementary information to your statement of confession made on the ***************** 1998".  Do you admit that the letter was written by you?
A.	Yes, but I should be shown the letter in question so that I can confirm that it was indeed of my hand.  I wrote the first letter on the ******************** 1998.  Now, when you're referring to supplementary information, then you wouldn't be talking about the letter of the 28th.  And I wrote many letters concerning this aspect. 
Q.	We shall get there.  We shall come to that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you have a copy of that letter?
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, it is not normal that I should give him a document that he wrote so that he can comment on this.  The prosecutor gave me this document and I cannot give this document to the witness.  Procedurally that cannot be done; it is up to the prosecutor.  It is the prosecutor who disclosed this document to me and I can't give it to you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But you're the one who's referring to the document.
MR. POGNON:
Yes, it was a document which was disclosed by the Prosecution.  It is a confession statement.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, but you are the one who is using the document and the witness has requested you to show him that letter because that letter is not dated.  I have it here before me.  It is not signed, it is not dated, and you are the one who is using it, so you should be able to provide a copy for the witness to take a look at so that he knows where we are.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, my problem is this: I want to ask him questions concerning what has been disclosed by the prosecutor, and it is said that these statements were made on various dates.  Now, if he is going to be shown the letter, will I then be able to ask him any questions?  So, please, given the circumstances, let me ask him the questions and then he will see the document.  It is impossible for him to be allowed to see this document before I put the questions to him because, otherwise, I won't be able to ask him any questions if we show him the document beforehand. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we are not trying to set a trap for you, but if you can answer this question, please do so.  If you're unable to answer without having this document before you, please say so. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.  What I was saying is that the letter which he claims to have been written on the ******************** 1998 is not the one to which he is referring, and I'm saying that because the ****************** 1998, when I began my confession procedure, I was speaking about Nyange events, but now he is trying to refer to the subject of the letter and saying that this is supplementary information concerning the statement of confession of ************** 1998.  It is clear, therefore, that that letter cannot be dated the ************* 1998. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We do agree with you, Mr. Witness.  That letter cannot be dated ***************. 
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	From where you were detained, did you write a letter to the state prosecutor?  As the subject matter of your letter, did you place the following words "Supplementary information regarding the statement of confession of ************ 1998"?  Maybe it wasn't dated on that date, but do you know -- are you aware of having written a letter concerning supplementary information?
A.	Yes, yes, I can confirm that.
Q.	Well, that is the letter which I'm referring to which the prosecutor disclosed to me.  The letter doesn't emanate from myself.  May I proceed?  Witness, may I go on?
A.	Yes, yes, ask me the question you want to put to me. 
Q.	Thank you.  You, yourself, wrote -- this is the last paragraph of that letter -- the following: "Furthermore, during the destruction of Nyange church, the communal authorities called all of the members of the population to help."   Did you write this at the time?  Is that what happened?  Did the authorities call on the people for help?
A.	That is how it happened, yes.  Such is the case. 
Q.	Thank you.  So what you wrote as a reflection of the truth is what really happened?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	Let me go on with the same letter: "Upon my arrival, at about 2:30 p.m., many people had surrounded the church.  Behind the church there were dead bodies.  They tried to open the doors, but they were unsuccessful.  They also tried to burn down the church, but that was also in vain.  Because it was dark outside, it was necessary to guard the church overnight and destroy it the next day."  Is this what you wrote, Witness?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Thank you.  "I went home the next day.  I returned there in the Astaldi vehicle that the communal authorities made available to the people."  Is this what you wrote, Witness?
A.	No, I made no such statement.
Q.	Very well.  Let's stop there for a moment, therefore.  As you said, the authorities called on the population.  Did the people on site number more than 10,000?
A.	Perhaps there were more than 10,000.  According to my estimates, I base myself on the number of Tutsis who were there and I said that the assailants were more than 4,000 in number.
Q.	Very well.  You said, "Upon my arrival at 2:30 p.m. many people had surrounded the church."  Does that mean that you arrived at 2:30 p.m. on Friday, and not between 11:00 in the morning and 1:00 in the afternoon?
A.	Please do not mix things up, Counsel.  If we put this paragraph into context, you will see that I've given a brief account of the events.  I skipped one step.  I did not speak of the fighting that went on when we were waiting for the bulldozers to arrive so that we could bury the bodies of the victims.  Also, I did not mention other facts.  This is a brief account of the facts because I was waiting to be called upon to fully explain in public and to show that I was not denying these facts and to show that to everyone.  When I arrived at about 2 p.m. the people had already surrounded the church.  There were dead bodies of the victims that we'd already killed. 
Q.	Earlier when I asked you the question, you said that you did not know whether or not there were any dead bodies of victims.  So you're going back over, you're changing what you said earlier, what you said some 30, perhaps, 45 minutes ago.  Let me move on.
A.	I disagree with you, Counsel.  When I arrived between eleven o'clock in the morning and 12:00 nobody had yet been killed.  I did not mention what happened between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.  I did not say everything.  I did not say everything.  I only gave some of the information because I said at the appropriate time I will have an opportunity to say everything. 
Q.	When you say "Upon my arrival at around 2:30 p.m.", you say that is when there were bodies.  How many times did you arrive on site, just once?  So you arrived once between 11:00 and 1:00 and another time at 2:30?  Let us be clear.  Let us agree on this, Witness.
A.	There must be a translation problem here.  Perhaps there's a translation problem.  When I arrived many things had happened.  I said what happened at 2:30 and then in the evening I described a situation. 
Q.	You are saying that when -- it was written down, "Upon my arrival, at around 2:30 p.m., many people had surrounded the church", and you were saying that when that was written down, "Upon my arrival at 2:30", that is not what really happened?
A.	I did not say, "Upon my arrival, at 2:30."  I said, "Upon my arrival, many things had happened.  At 2:30 p.m. many things happened, other things occurred in the evening."  So I gave an account of the events that took place at 2 p.m.  At 2 p.m. there were bodies, dead bodies, and the attackers had surrounded the church.  There were things that happened at 3 p.m. and other things, different things, that happened in the evening when the people started to go home.
Q.	Very well.  Let me proceed with your letter.  "Since it was dark outside it was necessary to guard the church all night long in order to destroy it the next morning.  I went home.  The next day I returned there in the Astaldi vehicle that the communal authorities made available to the people."  Does this sentence reflect the reality, the truth that you wanted to provide to the prosecutor at the time, Witness?
A.	I disagree here with you.  This is the Friday we came in the vehicle.  On the Saturday we came to Nyange on foot.
Q.	That means that your letter written by your hand, your work, if you will, is not a reflection of the truth; is that correct?
A.	That is why I wanted to look at the letter so I could recognise it.  As I've said and as I'm saying today, if you conduct an investigation, you will know that the vehicles were made available to the people on Friday.  On Saturday we did not come in vehicles.  In the evening the vehicles were made available to drive people back home.
Q.	Let me proceed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, you have an observation? 
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, honestly.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The prosecutor is standing.  I simply want to know what he wants to say.  Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, you may have the floor. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you, Your Honours.  The original Kinyarwanda version of this statement is one page and the witness has asked now twice to see it.  Counsel has read nearly all of it.  I'm not sure if there's any purpose in denying the witness's request in order to authenticate it. 
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I never said that he didn't say the truth.  I'm simply reading out the letter to the witness and he's saying that it doesn't reflect the truth.  We are in a trial here and people are clearly entitled not to tell the truth.  We all know this, and you know that, learned colleague.  Consequently, that is not a problem -- not a problem that people don't always tell the truth.  We are not in church here. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That is your opinion, Counsel. 
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I am counsel and I think that people are free to testify and to tell or to not tell the truth.  That is simply a question of their own freedom to do so.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, perhaps we should take the break now.  Do you anticipate having many more questions for this witness?
MR. POGNON:
Yes, I do have many more.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We will adjourn for 15 minutes.  These proceedings are adjourned. 
(Court recessed from 1620H to 1640H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We shall now resume.  

Mr. Pognon, you still have the floor. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please. 

MR. POGNON:
Most obliged, Your Honour. 
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	I was at the point of the additional information of the -- concerning your letter of the 28th of November (sic) 1998; is that correct?  Now, the sentence says, the next sentence, it is the day after -- "Upon my arrival, the mechanical shovel had started destroying the church.  They left that location when the entire building was destroyed". 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter doesn't have his glasses, so he's making a slight translation. 
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Did you say so, Witness?
A.	Yes, I did make that statement, but for a reason, for a given reason.  I said that when I arrived the mechanical shovel had started working, had gone to work, but in reality, as a matter of fact, it did not start operating at that particular time.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, the next passage of the next letter from the witness --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecutor.
MR. POGNON:
We are --
MR. TOWNSEND:
Do I understand Counsel is going to seek to admit as an exhibit into evidence the letter from which he's just been reading, and if so, this might be a good time and it might also be a good time to put the original before the witness if he's done with this prior confessional statement.  And that was my objection before the Trial Chamber went into recess; in other words, if counsel's finished reading from this letter, I'd ask that the original be put in front of the witness and allow him to authenticate it and maybe it would be a good time to move it into evidence, if that's what Counsel seeks to do.  And I should add that I think it's unfair if we do not give the witness an opportunity to actually look at his statement. 
MR. POGNON:
Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel. 
MR. POGNON:
I totally agree with my learned friend's prayer.  I have, as he said, the document in Kinyarwanda.  It could be given to the witness or translated -- perhaps the interpreters could translate it so that -- since it is a document from the Prosecutor, we shall tender it into evidence. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may show this document to the witness. 
MR. POGNON:
Yes, I kept it very carefully when I received it from the prosecutor.  We would like that copy back because that's the only one we have. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, have you read the document? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Madam President, I have. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you admit that this is the document you sent to the authorities, the Rwandan authorities? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, this, indeed -- my document.  As I was telling Mr. Pognon, this is not a document which was dated ************* 1998; rather, it is a document in which there is supplementary information.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What is the date of the document in question?
THE WITNESS:
Even here the date is not legible and I do not remember the date either, but I can guess that it was in 1999.  I no longer recall what month.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  This document -- are you asking for the tendering of this document, Mr. Pognon?  Mr. Prosecutor, do you have any opposition to that? 
MR. TOWNSEND:
No objection, Your Honour, if the K-number just can be put in by Counsel, and then if the Trial Chamber can allow for an English translation eventually to catch up. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel is not speaking into the microphone. 
MR. POGNON:
The only copy I had in Kinyarwanda has been taken and the French copy that I have is K0335018. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now, the document in Kinyarwanda, which is signed by the witness, is K0334088.  So this document is admitted as a Defence exhibit.  And the number for it please, registry?  Do you have the number for this?  Can you come to our assistance, please?  The registry is indicating that it should be reference D. 39, D. 39. 

Now, I'm wondering whether this document should be placed under seal because there is information regarding the witness, so this document should be placed under seal and it is done. 
(Exhibit No. D. 39 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Counsel. 
MR. POGNON:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	I now come, Mr. Witness, to your guilty plea and confession of 21st August 2000.  This is a letter dated 21st August 2000 and a letter which you sent to the detention centre under -- where you're in detention, and it is addressed to the same state prosecutor as I had stated earlier.  Now, I'm looking at page K0335040.  And the handwriting is 2400 bis.  Now, I'm looking towards the end of the page.  No, I'm at the second paragraph on that page, and you stated the following --
MR. TOWNSEND:
I'm sorry to interrupt and I think, counsel -- to avoid losing time in a reading of the statement later I'd ask that the counsel put the statement in Kinyarwanda, the original, before the witness at this time so as to allow him to properly authenticate the document and answer in an intelligent manner. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, do you have the document in Kinyarwanda?
MR. POGNON:
I do, but the problem is that if he reads the document, I would not be able to put my questions.  If he reads the document, he will base his answers on the document.  He should be given the document later.  There's nothing bad about that.  This is a document from the prosecutor. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  You may then go ahead with the question. 
MR. POGNON:
We shall give him the document.  It is here.  I want the registrar to send us back our copy because that's the only one we have in Kinyarwanda. 
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	"In my letter I confessed how we have some responsibility in the events at Nyange.  On the day the church was destroyed, the commune mobilised the population and put at their disposal Astaldi trucks to facilitate their transportation.  I left in the company of people I mentioned earlier on and many others including people from Kibilira."   

Now, Witness, do you remember having written that or said so?
A.	Yes, sir, I do recognise this passage.
(Pages 43 to 52 by Roxane Lane)



	1700H
THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir, I do recognise this passage.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Very well.  So, my question -- the question of the Astaldi truck issue has been resolved.  You were transported at least once with Astaldi trucks; is that correct?
A.	As a matter of fact, that truck that took us was driven by a young man called Mutuyimana.  I didn't know whether the truck belonged to Astaldi.  Some people had said that it was looted, but all I know is that it was Astaldi trucks that carried the stones, that carried the people.  All I know is that I was taken on Mutuyimana's truck.  I do not know whether that truck belonged to Astaldi.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, here you say further on, this is an explanation, "Subsequently, there were demonstrations during the day by the Bakiga from Ramba and Kibanda, as well as Mpunge Twas played musical instruments, such as bagpipes."  Do you recognise that?
A.	Yes, I do confess that I made such a statement?
Q	Now, what were the circumstances that warranted such demonstrations?
A.	Those minor demonstrations were organised when they came.  Those demonstrations were organised after the throwing of the grenades among the Tutsis.  Some of the Tutsi had been hiding in the church and others had fled into the presbytery.  At that time we had surrounded the church, and some were dancing; others were playing those musical instruments to mark the beginning of our victory.
Q.	Thank you.  You, in the next paragraph you say, "On the leadership of Ndugutse, Rushema, the police of the commune tried to open the door without success.  They used axes.  They didn't succeed.  They used Astaldi dynamite, and they also failed."  Do you agree with this?  Do you agree having said so?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	Now, let me proceed.  You say, "Then they went to negotiate with Father Seromba and Kayiranga to destroy the church."  Do you remember that?
A.	That happened by the end of the day.  The negotiations were not for the destruction of the church; they were for guarding the refugees during the night and to ensure the security of the church, too, during the night.
Q.	So, by writing this, it was then that they went to negotiate with Father Seromba and Kayiranga to destroy the church.  What you were saying here is not the truth, is it?
A.	Now, that does not mean that is it not the truth.  It depends on how you interpret this particular sentence.  I am saying that I was -- I was trying to explain briefly what happened when they went to get Seromba.  The people were ready to go home.  Now, before going home, Seromba should be told that the people were going home and that it was necessary for the refugees to be guarded, the refugees that had survived, so that we would continue the rest of the work the next day.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone please.
MR. POGNON:
I'm sorry.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Now, if I take your version, to the letter, that is, as you are interpreting it now, as translated from Kinyarwanda, does this mean that you went to talk to Father Athanase Seromba about guarding the refugees in the church, so the refugees do not run away from the church; is that correct?
A.	Now, when you say, sir, "You went to talk, to negotiate", I said I was with Rushema and Ndugutse, we tried to open the church.  These are two different events.  When the attackers went to negotiate with Seromba to tell him that the work was to be continued the following day, they did so -- we did so because the Tutsi had locked themselves up in the church.  Kibilira people came to reinforce us, and he was -- Seromba was to be informed that those people that had come from afar were going to spend the night in the church and that the operations would continue the next day.
Q.	Who went to negotiate with Seromba, that is, at that particular juncture?
A.	As I said in this letter that you have, many people were involved.  There was Kanyarukiga; there was a *************************** (phonetic); there was Ndugutse; Kayishema.  They went back to the presbytery.  These are names that I mentioned in the letter and I said that, upon their return, they didn't tell us about the outcome of their negotiations.   Each announced to his group, individually, the results and, finally, our leaders told us to go home; whereas, other leaders compelled some people to stay at the church to guard the refugees.
Q.	Now, if I were to tell you that since your examination-in-chief by the prosecutor this morning, since then, and on the basis of -- on the basis of all the documents received, this is the first time that you talk about negotiations being carried out with Seromba about guarding the Tutsi in the church.  Is that correct?  Is this the first time?  Am I correct to say that this is the first time you talk about negotiations?
A.	Yes, you may say that this is the first time you hear about such negotiations, because I told you that if I were to narrate all the events as they happened, we would not have enough paper to record all the events that I would narrate.  Probably, what you want to say is that I wasn't there, but I was there.  And when those people went to talk to Seromba I didn't go with them.  But to say that this is first time that you hear me say so, I am simply testifying about events.  I am simply a witness and I was there.
Q.	Who is Kayiranga, Witness?
A.	Kayiranga was a priest who was a native of Kivumu.  That is where I come from.  It so happened that he was in our parish on that day.  Before that he was living in Nyundo.  It was even said that he came two days -- or one day before the events.  I am not sure of the day of his arrival, but it was said that he had just spent one or two days at Nyange.
Q.	Now, where did you get this information from?
A.	As he had family in our secteur, there was one, Melchoir (phonetic), a man who was from Gasave, and I knew that I -- he had just spent several days.  He had come to Nyange to seek refuge.   Actually, when they left to see the priests it was for the purpose of telling them that people were going to disperse, and that there were other people that had come from afar and that were to spend the night at the church so that nobody would disturb them, because they were to spend the night at the church.  They had come from afar.  The priests were to be told that also some people were to go back home for the night.
Q.	Well, earlier on, when I asked you about the priests in the parish you said that there were two of them: one you knew, that was Seromba, and the other you did not know, at least his name.  Why didn't you talk about Kayiranga then?
A.	I'm saying that Kayiranga didn't work at Nyange.  He lived in Nyundo.  He had come to Nyange to seek refuge and he had just spent a few days there.  I believe he stayed in Nyange up to the time he fled, but it was being said that when he came to Nyange he was running away from events that took place where he was formerly.  And, subsequently, actually, he was accused of having participated in those events and then, later on, he was acquitted.
Q.	How long was he there for, how many days?  When people went to see him with Seromba, how many days was he there for?
A.	Well, all I know is that he had just spent a few days there.  I think it was less than a week.  He had just arrived in Nyange and he was running away from the Nyundo events, so that he had come to Nyange to seek refuge.
Q.	If he wasn't from Nyange, he went to Nyange to seek refuge and he had been there for several days, why do you write here that to guard people in the parish -- and that one had gone to negotiate with Seromba and Kayiranga -- why did you write this?
A.	I'm saying so because when Seromba was there it is also said that he wasn't alone.  He was with one Nturiye, so that we are talking about two people here that had come to Nyange and, as they knew the area and since Father Seromba was the head of the parish, those two priests were to deal with those people that had come from afar as reinforcements.  They were to ensure that they had food and that they spent the night there.
Q.	Where was Seromba?  Where was Kayiranga?  Where did Seromba come from?  He was a native of what area?  And Kayiranga, too, he was a native of which area?
A.	He came from Kivumu commune.  That was a very well-known person to the inhabitants of Kivumu.  He was very accustomed to the area.
Q.	Now, in proportion, as we go on in this cross-examination, we see that in the parish, apart from Seromba, there was another priest whose name you do not know.  Now, you've just talked about Kayiranga and Nturiye.  Why is it that earlier on when I put to you the question as to whether there were other priests in the parish, you did not give us that information?
A.	You will excuse me.  I am sure you understand me, because among the priests that worked at Nyange, I, moreover, told you that there was another priest that I knew by sight, but not by name.  I told you that there were other people who worked with Seromba, but Kayiranga and Nturiye were natives of Kivumu.  They came to Nyange to seek refuge during the war.  Now, when you talk about other priests, I did not mention other priests because they never took part in the event; they never took part in the killings.  So that we went so see Kayiranga and Seromba to ask them to take care of the people who were to stay behind so they could get some food.  It was not those people that went.  They simply went to see Seromba and Kayiranga.
Q.	When you say "we" -- or "they" --
A.	Now, when I say "we", we went to Nyange; we went to see the priests.  These are two different things.  When I went to Nyange I was in the company of many -- several other people.  I told you that we went with Ndugutse and Rushema and other important people that were to undertake the attacks when we wanted to attack the church, but there came a time when we wanted to see Father Seromba, and people who had come from afar who had spent some time in the area, they had to eat.  I was not a member of the delegation.  Even if I was not a leader of the killing -- but I was one of the attackers.  I was one of the attackers, even although I was (sic) the leader.
Q.	As you say -- if, as you say, Kayiranga and Nturiye came to seek refuge at Nyange, and there you are right, they ran away from Nyundo where people were killed in the church, now, how is it then that one could go to ask Kayiranga, for example, who had come to seek refuge, to protect attackers that wanted to kill the Tutsi?  How -- could you explain that?
A.	Now, let me explain that at that time people were just like beasts, like animals.  I'm not talking about other people, including myself, so that one could accuse them of having gone to see Kayiranga, whereas Kayiranga himself was a refugee himself.  He was a refugee.  I don't see any reason why they would go and see people like Kayiranga to take care of the people who were to sleep or spend the night there.  At any rate, people were used to killing.  They had lost reason.  They had lost reason totally, and they went to see Kayiranga and Seromba, as though they were one of them.  They were used to killing and they wanted to get Seromba and Kayiranga to compel those people.
Q.	To compel Nturiye as well?
A.	No, sir.  I cannot confirm that.  Even what I've just said, I don't know whether Kayiranga obliged, because I didn't spend the night there.  It was -- it is Seromba that can tell us whether he helped or not, whether Kayiranga helped Seromba or not.  I cannot tell you what happened after we left.
Q.	Did they tell you that they tried to compel the other priests whose name you do not remember or you do not know?
A.	No, sir.  I didn't even say so.  I didn't say anything like that.  I don't know anything about that.
Q.	Now, why do you think that it was necessary to go and negotiate with Kayiranga and Seromba concerning the guarding of the refugees in the church?
A.	Well, that is a question that cannot be answered.  We didn't come to assist the refugees.  Some of the refugees had been killed, after all.  Now, if the refugees were to be guarded, it was to prevent them from leaving the church.  Those Hutu were killers, just as ourselves.  Actually, it was not a question of negotiating with Seromba; it was simply a question of telling him that he should be responsible for the people who were going to spend the night at the church, probably to give them food so that they do not die of hunger.  We needed -- they worked with Seromba.  Hadn't they known that those people were there, they wouldn't have asked him to take care of those people who were going to spend the night at that location.
Q.	Now, if I get you correctly, Witness, you mean that what Kayiranga and Seromba were requested to do, according to what you wrote, was to feed the refugees that were on the spot; is that correct?
A.	No, I don't know what refugees you are talking about.  The refugees who were in the church -- inside the church and they had started killing them.
Q.	The killers -- Kayiranga and Seromba were asked to feed the attackers; is that correct?
A.	Now, you know, there would be a need to give details.  It was said that people were going to spend the night at the church and the next day that killings were going to continue and in the meantime those people were to be fed and taken care of.  But I'm very clear as to the need for food was concerned.
Q.	Who was to give them some food?
A.	It is clear, sir.  The presbytery, the priests where they spent the night and other communal authorities contributed, taking care of the people that were going to spend the night at that location.
Q.	Now, if I were to put it to you that there, too, Witness, in all of the documents, this is the very first time that you are making such a statement to the effect that Seromba and Kayiranga were requested to ensure some food for the attackers that were to stay in the parish, so that the church would be destroyed the next morning.  This is the first time you are saying so; is that correct?
A.	Mr. Pognon, Counsel Pognon, you are saying that this is the first time that I'm saying so.  But this does not mean -- that doesn't mean that it did not happen.  I am saying so.  There are many things that took place in that location.  I cannot record everything that took place there in two documents or even in more than two documents.  I cannot give you a narration of all the facts.  I, I, I cannot.  I'm not in a position to tell you everything that happened.  Even during the gacaca jurisdiction, those that will be held, there are only details that will come out, but I'm not in a position to give you all the details here in a document, or even in more than one document.  I am simply not in a position to do so.
Q.	Now, does that mean that the truth that is spelt out in the document, the confession of guilt before this Tribunal, is truth that comes only in parts or that extends and expands and gets retracted wherever possible?
A.	Now, in these documents, there are parts of the events.  I tried to guide you as to what happened.  But now I'm giving you details; I am giving you details about the events that took place.  They just took place.
Q.	Thank you.  Thank you, Witness.  Now, the attackers that stayed to guard the parish, how many were they?  Give me an estimation.
A.	I am not in a position to offer a figure because on my way back home other people were leaving, but it was clear that the Kibilira and Ramba people were to stay there, that location.  Now, Rukiga -- Kanyarukiga, who had a pistol, threatened some people and compelled them to stay.  Rukara also compelled some people to stay, so that I'm not in a position really to give you a figure, even if it is an approximate figure, of the number of people that stayed behind.  I know -- all I know is that some people stayed behind and in the morning when I came back other people had come back before me, so that the next day -- rather, the day before some people wanted to go back home and some people were compelled to stay the night.
Q.	You cannot estimate the number of people from Kibilira, from Ramba, that stayed behind; 500 would you say, 200, 1,000?
A.	I'm sorry; I am not in a position to offer a figure.  Actually those people were not at Kibilira and Ramba only; others came from the Kivumu commune that stayed behind.  When I left, some people had decided to stay behind and others had left, and, as I didn't stay that night, I couldn't give you a figure as to the number of people that remained behind that night.
Q.	But how could you have done, Witness -- how could you -- since you know that there were quite a number of people there, how could you, therefore, ask the priests to provide food for those people in view of their numbers?
A.	Well, we went to inform the priests that people were going to stay the night there.  That doesn't mean that we were asking them to give them food.  But the Tutsi had fields, agricultural fields, and they had cattle, and cattle were killed during the night there.  That night cattle meat was roasted.
Q.	Now, to be clear, it was you, yourselves, having looted, that fed those people and not the priests; is that correct?
A.	I don't know what you mean by saying that we fed those people.  I don't know whether you are referring to me, or to another group, or some people who worked with me.  They spent the night there.  The priests were informed that people were going to stay the night and we informed him, just as we worked with him throughout day, just like the Hutu that collaborated, that worked together to kill Tutsi.  It was just normal collaboration with the communal authorities.  This is what I mean.  This is how you should see it.  We are talking about somebody that was influential in the commune and we had to inform him that people were going to stay the night in the commune and, since we worked within the commune and probably -- with the commune, those cows were offered to them, but the matter of fact (sic) is that the next day, the next morning, we had seen that the cows had been killed and they had been used to feed those people.
Q.	Now, if it is that, in the final analysis, as far as Seromba is concerned, what do you have as a reason to associate Kayiranga with that?
A.	I told you, sir, that, as a matter of fact it was a matter of chance that Kayiranga was there.  He was associated with Seromba.  I am not in a position to assert that he did work with Seromba because I never saw him.  It may be the case, but it was said that Seromba was going to be informed that people were going to stay the night and that those people had to be fed in one way or another.  I am not in a position to tell you what was done to decide, for example, that those cows be killed, be slaughtered, and that the refugees should eat the meat.  The matter of the fact (sic) is that the next morning we realised that those people had eaten properly and that they were there, and they were guarding the church, and that there was no major problem as far as the refugees were concerned.
Q.	Could we know who fed them, who fed those crowds?
A.	Well, that is a question to which I have no answer.  Seromba was informed that those people were going to stay the night to guard the church.  As far as the rest is concerned, you may put this question to Seromba.  Seromba will tell you as to the manner he went about it with the commune.  That task was assigned to Seromba.  I do not know how he went about it with the communal authorities.  Perhaps you should put that question to him.
Q.	Now, you are the one making statements.  You are the one that should authenticate your statements.  I cannot ask questions to Seromba.  I am asking questions to you.  May I proceed?
A.	Yes, I will react to your questions.  Yes, we left those people there.  They ate properly, and the next morning we saw so, but I cannot tell you who fed them.  But I'm saying that before we went back home we had informed Seromba about the fact that those people were going to spend the night there.
Q.	May I continue reading your document, Witness?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, do you still have many questions?
MR. POGNON:
I am working on the document served to me by the prosecutor.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I do understand that.  I am asking you whether you need some more time to wind up.
MR. POGNON:
I believe I will need tomorrow morning.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Tomorrow morning, also.  We should, therefore, adjourn, at this point, this afternoon's session.  We shall resume tomorrow at nine o'clock.

You have filed the list of witnesses, Mr. Pognon, the list of your witnesses?
MR. POGNON:
Yes, Your Honour.  This has been done for a long time now.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Very well.  We shall take cognisance, yes.

Prosecutor.  Prosecutor.

MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you, Your Honours.  I have two very brief housekeeping matters.  I just note that earlier in the witness's testimony, he made a reference to a wall, and I think it's the wall that's behind you, and I just think it would be easier for the transcript if we make a record saying that the witness earlier in his testimony made a reference to the wall, which I understand to be the one behind the Judges, which I would offer as, maybe, seven metres away from the witness booth, when he was talking about the distance from the church wall to where the people were standing by a bulldozer.  If there is no objection, if the record could so reflect. 

And the only other second matter is that the record might reflect that the Accused, himself, has been present for the session since the afternoon break.  Thanks.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  According to what the Prosecutor has just said, could you kindly put on record that the witness talked about this wall that is just behind us, the Bench, and we have various indications regarding the size of the room.  Perhaps we should just refer to that.  He said that it's about seven metres, so far as the distance is concerned between the wall of the church and the people that were out there standing.

Now, regarding the cross, we shall continue tomorrow.  It might be a good thing to have a status conference tomorrow to resolve housekeeping issues concerning our next session that should start on the 1st of March 2005.

Very well.  This is all we wanted to say before we rise.

Witness, we should like to remind you that you are still under oath, and that tomorrow morning Mr. Pognon will continue his cross-examination.

We shall now rise 'til tomorrow at 9 a.m.  Thank you.
(Court adjourned at 1744H)
