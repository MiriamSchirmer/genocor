MADAM PRESIDENT:
The session is declared open.  We are reminding you all that we are sitting in closed session and that the Prosecutor is going to continue with his cross-examination of the witness, Witness PA1.

We also wish to make the following clear to you all: it will be necessary that the cross-examination be concluded by the Prosecution today and that on Monday we hear the Accused, given that it is only on Wednesday that we can have the video conference for the last witness.  We cannot do otherwise, given the fact that this session must come to an end on the 27th of April 2006.  We are, therefore, asking the parties to comply with this ruling which has been made by the Chamber.  And we thank you all for your kind compliance.

Mr. Prosecutor, you have the floor for the follow-up of the cross-examination of this witness.
MR. TOWNSEND:
May it please the Trial Chamber, thank you, Your Honours.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 2 to 38] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
