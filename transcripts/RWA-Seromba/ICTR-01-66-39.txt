MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are called to order.  Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.  Witness BZ14, good afternoon. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Prosecution is going to continue with their cross-examination of you, Mr. Witness.  We should like to remind you that you are still under oath.  

Mr. Prosecutor, you have the floor. 
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honours. 
WITNESS BZ14,
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, when we finished yesterday afternoon we had got up to the date of April 15th.  And you had told the Trial Chamber that you arrived at around 11:00 to 11:30 that morning; do you remember saying that? 
A.	Yes, I remember. 
Q.	Do I understand from your testimony in court last week that you had, in fact, gone that day ************ *********** over a friend's shop? 
A.	Yes, that was a friend.  I went ***********that belonged to a friend, but at the same time that person was a responsable in the cellule. 
Q.	Was that shop in the Nyange commercial centre? 
A.	It was. 
Q.	You hadn't gone to the commercial centre that day to look for Mr. Seromba, had you; you had gone there ********the shop? 
A.	Yes, I went to that place intending **********the shop in question.  That didn't stop me from seeing everything that was going on around me. 
Q.	Now, Witness, I would like you to have a look at this photograph.  It is an enlargement of Prosecution Exhibit 312.  Now, Witness, looking at that copy of a photograph, do you recognise the Codekoki building at the rear of that photograph? 
A.	Yes, I can see the building where Codekoki is located; I know it well.  I also see the statue of the    Virgin Mary on the photograph.  Of course, the road that I see here wasn't there at the time.  There must have been some changes since; otherwise, the buildings are clear to see on the photograph. 
Q.	Now, the building that you can see in front -- well in front of or to the left-hand side of the statue of Mary, are you able to see the shop that you had gone to *************in this photograph? 
A.	No, it is not visible, the shop is not visible.  It was to the right-hand side where there was a road, but I don't see it here on the photo that I have here before me. 
Q.	All right.  Well, I'm wondering if the registry could provide you with a pen.  And if you could -- could you place an arrow in the direction of the road where you say the shop was that you had gone ********** ******* over? 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Objection, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, Your Honours, the witness has indicated that on the photograph in front of him he cannot see the shop that he was ***********.  So he cannot show where he was because it is not on the photograph, that question cannot be admissible.  
MR. MOSES:
Perhaps it was a matter of translation. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. MOSES:
I will repeat the question because I had not, in fact, asked the witness to mark where the shop was because of his previous answer.  What I had asked the witness to do was point to -- to place an arrow on that document, pointing in the direction of the road where he says the shop was that he was standing *******. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, even that question is not admissible.  Here is what the witness is saying, I recognise Codekoki, I recognise the statue.  There is also the statue -- there is also a road that used to not -- that wasn't there before; but he doesn't see the shop.  It doesn't seem even in that form to be an admissible question, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
In his answer the witness said, if I understood clearly, that the shop was to the right-hand side.  I think the Prosecution simply wants him to indicate with an arrow the direction of the shop he was *******, but not the shop itself because the witness did, indeed, say that the shop cannot be seen on the photograph. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Very well, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, please use an arrow to indicate the direction where the shop was that you were **********. 
THE WITNESS:
I have done that, Madam President. 
MR. MOSES:
Your Honours, I would ask that that document be admitted as Prosecution Exhibit -- I think we are up to 29, perhaps, now. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any observations, Mr. Monthé?  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
No objection, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The said document is admitted as a Defence Exhibit, P. 29 -- no, in fact, Prosecution Exhibit, not a Defence exhibit, Prosecution Exhibit P. 29 admitted and marked.
(Exhibit No. P. 29 admitted)
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honours. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, Witness, was this shop that you were *********on the main road from Kibuye to Gitarama, or was it on a side road? 
A.	The shop was located in that centre in town. 
Q.	All right.  Well, I'm now going to have another photograph -- photocopy of a Prosecution Exhibit shown to you.  It is a photocopy of Prosecution Exhibit 316.  Now, looking at that photocopy of a photograph, Witness, to you recognise what that -- the building that is shown in that photograph? 
A.	Yes, I recognise these buildings.  They are in Nyange town.  I recognise a few of the buildings that used to be there during that period. 
Q.	And the brick building you can see to the left-hand side of that photograph, is that the rear of the building which houses the statue of Mary? 
A.	This is a new photograph.  At the time this road wasn't there, only these buildings were.  Apart from those buildings it is difficult to recognise the area.  True there are some buildings that I recognise which were there at the time.  I can see Patrice's (phonetic) and Salmon's building, for example, but I don't see the shop or any of the buildings which were close to it. 
Q.	Can you see the road in which the shop that you say you went  ********* was on back in 1994? 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Objection, Madam President.  This witness has already explained himself with regard to that shop, which is not seen on the photograph he has in front of him.  He also said that the road at the time was not there.  So which road is he supposed to talk about to the Chamber?  At the time the road was not there, according to this witness. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecution. 
MR. MOSES:
The evidence that the witness gave was that he couldn't see -- the shop was no longer where it was.  That is my understanding, but I'm happy to go back and clarify that with the witness if it would assist the Trial Chamber. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, the road you can see to the left-hand side of that photograph, that is the road from Gitarama to Kibuye, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, the road goes to Kibuye.  On this photograph I can clearly see a road which goes to the parish and which goes on to Kibuye and Gitarama.  But I also see another road, a secondary road; it is not a tarred road.  It led to the Mutanuga market.  It is clear that those shops are no longer there.  They weren't solid structures like this building, for example.  So I don't see them any more on this photograph. 
Q.	All right.  Well, can you please, with the pen, mark on the photograph before you where they were in 1994, if you can see the position that they were in that photograph.

Witness, you have drawn a line which covers a fairly long stretch of road.  I'm wanting you, if you can, to be a little less precise where the shop was that you were ********.  And if you are able to be somewhat more precise than you have been, could you please mark, using the red pen which the registrar will provide to you, if you can write the number 1 in the position where the shop was that you were **************.

Witness, you say that you went there that day ******that shop, did you remain standing ***over that shop or did you go and join the attackers at some stage during the day?  
A.	I'll explain if you didn't understand me properly because I think even the transcripts would show this, but if we were talking about **********the shop, it wasn't a matter of sitting in front of the shop, it was          ********on the building.  Furthermore, I didn't go there in order to kill anyone, but it is true I went ******* the building, but I could also observe what was happening.  You don't *****************a building by going into ******************************.  You stay *************************.  You could realise that you could also notice what was happening at the centre.  I think I explained the circumstances under which I went to that place.  I didn't go there in order to carry out any killings. 
Q.	How far away did you move from this shop at any stage during that day of the 15th so that you were still "able to *************on it" using your words? 
A.	You know, even if you are looking at what is happening, you cannot get close to where there is certain death.  So please show me the first photograph that you had shown me and I will show you the place to which I was able to go -- up until where I was able to go in relation to that shop. 
Q.	Happy to do that, Witness.  
MR. MOSES:
If the witness could be now shown again Prosecution Exhibit 29.
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Once again, using your pen, if you could place the Number 1 on the spot where you say you were able to go to.

Now you have indicated, haven't you, Witness, beside the statue of Mary as the position from which you observed the events on the 15th; am I correct?  
A.	Yes, it is, indeed, at this building that I was, and I was with two or three other people only -- with three or four other people only.  That is why we were standing and we were looking at what was happening at the parish.  Let me remind you that when we were, there was fighting at the parish and people were throwing stones at one another. 
Q.	Would you agree, Witness, whilst you might not be able to put a number -- an actual number on those who were attacking the refugees, would you agree with me if I were to suggest that there were several thousand people attacking the refugees at the church of Nyange on that day? 
A.	Yes, that is understandable.  The attackers were more in number than the refugees. 
Q.	And those attackers were down by the commercial centre and also they were surrounding the church, weren't they? 
A.	You see from where I was standing, there were few people and I was afraid.  And I was telling you also that the attackers were not where I was, they were rather at the church and on the road that leads to the church.  There were other people who were afraid who were on the Codekoki side.  As for the attackers, whom we can call the brave, they were in the direction of the church doing what they were doing and we were standing here in fear. 
Q.	How long after you arrived at the Nyange commercial centre that day was it that you saw reservists throwing grenades at the refugees, an hour, two hours, half an hour, how long was it? 
A.	I had spent some time there, I cannot be specific about the duration of time, but the main thing is that I was there.  Otherwise, I did spend a certain amount of time there. 
Q.	Well, without committing you to a specific number of minutes, can you assist us what you mean by a certain period of time.  Are we talking an hour, more than an hour or less than an hour? 
A.	I would say one and a half hours. 
Q.	Now, it is your evidence, isn't it, Witness, that you never saw any clergy or seminarist at Nyange on the 15th or the 16th of April 1994; is that correct?  
A.	That is right. 
Q.	And you have told the Trial Chamber that you knew a Father Nturiye, and you didn't see him outside the church at any time on the 15th, did you? 
A.	Yes, actually I didn't see Nturiye there.  Moreover, I don't have much to say regarding Nturiye.  All I said was that he hailed from Kivumu, he was a native of Kivumu. 
Q.	Well, Witness, do you accept that it is, at least, possible that Father Nturiye was in the courtyard outside of the church, not long before the grenades were thrown at the refugees, but you simply didn't or couldn't see him from where you were standing? 
A.	I can't confirm anything because I wasn't a witness of that.  I cannot confirm that he was there on the site because I didn't see him there, so I can't confirm anything in that regard.  If you begin confirming things of which you were not a witness this would be tantamount to telling lies.  I would -- I took a solemn declaration to say that I would say the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. 
Q.	So I'm clear on this point for you, Witness, I'm not suggesting that you did see him.  My question was, do you agree that it is possible that he was there at some time shortly before these grenades were thrown but you simply didn't or couldn't see him.  Do you agree that it is possible? 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation) 
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President. 
THE WITNESS:
I can confirm nothing.  If you know someone and that person saw him there, you address yourself to that person because you are asking me, it is possible that they saw that.  I'm telling you that it isn't possible, I didn't see him.  If someone by chance saw him, let that person come and confirm.   
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	All right.  Similarly, Witness, bearing in mind that you didn't see Father Nturiye, it is possible, can I suggest to you, that Mr. Seromba was outside of the church at some stages during the day of the 15th and you simply didn't or couldn't see him; that is possible, isn't it? 
A.	What I can say is this, at that point in time neither myself or Seromba knew that this Tribunal would be established.  I told you that I saw people in that location and I mentioned them.  I spoke to you of quite a number of people, be they people who lived in the secteur which is close to mine, I gave you their names.  So why wouldn't I tell you that Father Seromba was there if really he was there?  I don't know whether he was able to hide himself, but at the time when I was seeing people here -- people there, I don't know whether he may have hidden so that I wouldn't be able to see him.  I didn't see him in that location. 
Q.	And there were several thousand people outside of the church, weren't there, Witness?  It is possible that he was there and you simply didn't see him amongst the crowd; that is possible, isn't it? 
A.	But, in what capacity was he present there?  As an authority, was he there as a member of the population or as a priest?  Did he join the inhabitants in the attacks?  No.  I know Seromba very well.  I was able to identify him here in a courtroom like anyone who lived in Nyange would have done.  Had he been there, I would have seen him. 
Q.	So, I am quite clear, it is your evidence, therefore, that it is not possible?  Is that what you are saying that it is not possible that he was there and that you simply didn't or couldn't see him; is that what you are telling the Trial Chamber? 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Objection, Madam President.  Madam President, the witness has already answered that he did not see Father Seromba in that location.  He can't be harassed in order to obtain the response that we want.  He said that he wasn't there and he said this many time. 
MR. MOSES:
With the greatest of respect to my learned friend, my question to the witness was, whether it was possible that Father Seromba was there, and that he simply didn't or could not see him.  The witness gave a very long answer without actually specifically answering that question.  I then put it to him with the summation of what he had just said in his answer, and his answer was it was not possible.  We don't have a direct answer to my initial question, Your Honours, and I'm trying to get one from this witness. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, I stand by my objection.  If the witness says that "I didn't see Father Seromba," he cannot be asked to imagine that it is possible that he was there.  He is the one who is responsible for this speculation.  He should be asked whether he was there, and if he was, whether he saw him; but since he wasn't there he is saying that he didn't see him. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you move on to another question or do you want to stay with this question because otherwise we will have to rule on this.

Yes, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
The Prosecutor has said that I gave a long answer by saying that it was possible.  There are two things, what is possible -- what is true is that he was not present in that location. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	All right, Witness, we will move on.  If you can have a look at the Prosecution Exhibit 29, which is the photograph of -- actually I don't -- I apologise, I think it is the one which we don't have a number for yet.  I will have the registry confirm that you are being shown the correct one.

It is a photograph, and it is Prosecution Exhibit 316.  Are you able to confirm, Witness, the position that the church was in before it was bulldozed in 1994?  
A.	I can see that this is, indeed, a photograph of Nyange and I can see a road going to the church, but I cannot see the church itself. 
Q.	Right.  Well you still have the pen in front of you, I'm wondering whether you could place the number 2 on the position that you say the church was if you were able to see in that photograph the position where you say the church was in 1994.
Now, Witness, you can see in that photograph, can't you, a road leading up to where you have marked where the church was in 1994?  Can you see that road?  
A.	Yes, quite so.  I can see the road and the photograph is clear. 
Q.	Would you agree with me that after you get to the brow of that hill there was a flat area of at least         50 metres from the top of that hill to where the door, the front main doors of the church of Nyange were; do you agree with that? 
A.	Yes, I can see that. 
Q.	I can suggest to you, Witness, that you simply could not have seen what was happening outside the front of the church from the position you were at beside the statue of Mary with thousands of attackers between you and the church.  And that your view was minimal if not nil.  What do you say to that? 
A.	I do not know whether you are concluding your cross-examination, but I haven't explained to you how I managed to get to the church because there was still some way to go.  And we still have some way to go and you will understand.  I would be grateful if you could present me with a picture of the location. 
Q.	Initially if you can answer my question, please, Witness?  From the position you pointed out, standing by the statue of Mary, do you agree that from that position you couldn't see the front of the church? 
A.	What I can tell you is that if Seromba had been an attacker the refugees would have noticed that.  I do not know whether he could remain in that location whereas the attackers were repelled by the refugees.  The attackers fled.  So how could it be that Seromba didn't flee?  They were throwing stones at one another, and the attackers fled.  So in that situation how Seromba could have remained in the area whereas the other attackers had fled?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, have you understood the question which was put to you?  If so, can you please respond in a more specific manner?  
THE WITNESS:
If the Prosecutor were to repeat the same question, please. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Would you agree with me, Witness, that from the position that you indicated that you were standing at beside the statue of Mary, you could not see the doors of the church from that position? 
A.	When one is in this location one can see the church.  So when we were there people were fighting and they were throwing stones at one another.  I'm going to repeat the following for you.  Let's suppose that three of us are attacking you, and you try to repel us.  Let's say you are with your wife and your wife becomes an enemy; we, the three attackers will now have someone to support us, someone who will be on our side.  Now are you going to consider your wife as a friend?  If we were to flee that same person, that same woman, wouldn't she also flee because she has become your enemy.  Now, if Seromba were an enemy he would have fled like the other attackers.  There were some people who were leading the attacks and when the refugees were defending themselves the attackers would beat a retreat.  And when the attackers came back, I could see them.  And I wasn't able to see Seromba among the attackers who were retreating when they were repelled by the refugees. 
Q.	Are you finished, Witness? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the Kinyarwanda booth is kindly asking the witness to slow down in his answer. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, have you heard that?  Kindly slow down in your answers; the interpreters are having difficulty following you.  Please speak more slowly and also attempt to the extent possible to respond specifically to the question put to you.  Don't elaborate too much, only answer the question put to you, Witness, please.

Mr. Prosecutor, you may proceed.  
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, you said in your evidence-in-chief last week that the leaders of the attack on the 15th were people from your area that you knew including Ndungutse and some other responsable of the secteur; do you remember saying that? 
A.	I made that statement and I also spoke about some communal authorities; Ndungutse was not alone.  I mentioned other communal officials. 
Q.	Right.  You also said, didn't you, that of the attackers that day, there was no one from your neighbourhood who took part in the attack; do you remember saying that? 
A.	Are you speaking about our neighbourhood; that is not clear to me?  
Q.	Well, I will read from the answer that you gave last week.  You were asked the question by my learned friend:  "Let's talk about these people who were attacking; were they people from your neighbourhood or were these people from elsewhere?"

You replied:  "No these were not people who were living in the area.  There were some others who had come from other areas, especially Kibilira, therefore from Gisenyi.  And others came from far off secteurs and I'm thinking of Sunsa (phonetic) secteur and others.  In fact, they came in pursuit of Tutsis from their areas who had left -- who had fled to our area."  Further on:  "So the attackers were coming from their locations because they were in pursuit of the fleeing Tutsis."

Do you remember saying that last week?  
A.	Yes, I made that statement.  I should provide further explanations, however.  There were some attackers led by --  
Q.	First answer my question; do you confirm that you said that last week? 
A.	Yes, I said that. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  So is your evidence -- can we take it from your evidence that the leaders of this attack were from your area but the participants were not; is that what your evidence is? 
A.	Let me explain.  The attackers came from far away, but on site they found others; they had the same criminal intentions.  The attackers from far away would find others already on site. 
Q.	These others are they from the local area, Witness? 
A.	They were the communal officials and other criminals.  In other words, those people are natives of our region. 
Q.	All right.  Now, after the grenades were thrown on the refugees you said in your evidence-in-chief last week that "The refugees withdraw to the church.  And as they had withdrawn the assailants attacked the building and they were firing through the windows and on the walls and the situation continued like that until the evening until the following day when the church was demolished." Do you remember saying that is.
A.	Yes, I said that. 
Q.	And when you say that "The situation continued like that", do you mean that the refugees remained inside of the church while the assailants fired at the church? 
A.	A grenade was thrown.  After that happened the refugees ran inside of the church.  I explained that people were told not to attack the church.  I believed that I said that the refugees locked themselves inside of the church.  After that, there were no more confrontations. I added that people spent the night there.  For my part, I went home. 
Q.	All right.  Now what time -- how long after the grenade was thrown did the refugees go and lock themselves inside of the church? 
A.	Shortly after the grenade was thrown the refugees immediately ran into the church.  Given also the fact that the assailants were finishing off those who were dying on the ground, those who had been hit by the shrapnel, for example.  
Q.	And those refugees who had locked themselves inside of the church they certainly were not going to come outside again, were they, having seen perhaps 200 of their fellow refugees killed just outside of the church, would you agree with that? 
A.	I never said that.  I don't know if someone who is fleeing would go back and count how many had fallen. 
Q.	Do you agree, however, that once the refugees locked themselves inside of the church they remained inside of the church from that time until the time you left at around 4:30?  Do you agree with that? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	So, when you said in evidence-in-chief last week "I think it was about 4 p.m., it is then that the gendarmes asked the refugees to surrender their weapons.  And once that operation was concluded the refugees went back into the church believing that the gendarmes were going to be responsible for their security and safety."  That wasn't true, was it? 
A.	Nobody asked me about the refugees being asked to surrender their weapons.  The refugees went back into the church.  Inside of the church they were asked to give back their weapons; but I never said something different. 
Q.	In fact, Witness, this whole story of the refugees being armed with weapons during that attack and then this story of the gendarmes taking the weapons off of them, that is all made up, isn't it? 
MR. NEKUIE:
(No interpretation)
THE WITNESS:
Nothing is made up. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Objection, Madam President.  I believe the Prosecution may make suggestions to the witness, but he cannot put words into the witness's mouth.  With regard to the gendarmes he asked if the witness saw the gendarmes at the church.  He said, yes he did.  No other question with regard to the weapons the refugees was giving.  As such, the Prosecution cannot insinuate and try to have the witness confirm those insinuations for him and, as such, the Defence kindly objects to that question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, do you have any response to that objection, or do you want to move on to a different question?  
MR. MOSES:
I think the witness has answered -- has answered the question I put.  He said he didn't make it up.  I'm happy to move on.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, go on with your next question.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Do you agree, Witness, that you never said anything about the refugees being armed during that attack on the 15th when you spoke to the Defence and gave statements to them on two occasions? 
A.	Could you repeat the question, Mr. Prosecutor?  
Q.	You never mentioned anything about the refugees being armed with traditional weapons, nor did you mention anything about gendarmes disarming refugees on the -- on that day of the 15th when you spoke to the Defence investigators on the two occasions that you gave statements.  Do you agree that you never mentioned that to those investigators? 
A.	I didn't deny that.  The refugees had traditional weapons.  I said that the gendarmes confiscated those weapons; I confirm that. 
Q.	But you never said that, did you, in either of the statements that you gave to the Defence you never mentioned that; isn't that correct? 
A.	I said it, if it wasn't written down I don't know what happened.  I believe that I told them that the refugees had traditional weapons, such as spears. 
Q.	Can you read French, Witness?  Are you able to read French? 
A.	No, I don't know French. 
Q.	Well, I'm going to have read for you and translated a paragraph from the statement you gave to the Defence on the 2nd of December last year.  
MR. MOSES:
I provided copies of the statements, which Your Honours have had disclosed, to both the French and the English booth.  I'm going to ask that the French booth read out from page 5 on the first statement, that is the statement of the 2nd of December, page 5 -- the fifth paragraph, commencing "nous somme -- " I will ask that the French -- I will stop my French reading at that stage, so I'm not accused of doing serious damage to the French language.  I am going to ask that the French booth read that paragraph and have it translated for the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I believe this is page 5, paragraph five, not paragraph two, paragraph five. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"We arrived at the parish at about 11 o'clock in the morning.  We saw that the refugees had left the church and were throwing stones at the assailants who wanted to attack them.  That is how they were able to repel the Hutus far from the church; that was on the 15th of April." 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Have you got the translation, Witness? 
A.	Yes, I heard the translation.  Have I changed anything I said?  
Q.	Now in that statement you mentioned the refugees throwing stones, but you made no mention at all, did you, of the refugees being armed with traditional weapons; do you agree? 
A.	Yes, they were throwing stones. 
Q.	And they weren't armed with traditional weapons, were they, the refugees? 
A.	I said that those refugees had traditional weapons, last week I repeated as much. 
Q.	That is the first time you have ever mentioned that, isn't it? 
A.	It is not the first time.  What we have just read, are we taking down the statement right now?  I believe that you mentioned the date when the statement was taken down. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Objection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Monthé.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, I'm surprised by this witness being badgered in this manner.  This is only a reference document.  The Prosecution would agree with me, we have said this on several occasions in the statement.  The witness is simply summarising what he saw or heard.  This witness has explained himself on this matter.  He has responded at least twice to the question saying they were armed with traditional weapons.  And I don't understand why he is continually being asked the same question. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  
MR. MOSES:
I'm finished with that line of questioning in any event, so I am happy to move on. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, were you actually at Nyange church on the afternoon of the 15th of April, or were you at home? 
A.	I was at Nyange. 
Q.	I'm going to ask the French booth to read to you, and this is on -- from the same statement, namely, the statement of 2nd December, page four which commences, (French spoken).  And if the translator could continue to read the first paragraph of page 5 from that statement, which commences (French spoken)? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Beginning on page four; "On Friday 15th of April, the assailants came back to the parish.  They killed very few Tutsis on that morning.  Only in the afternoon at about 3 p.m. were they able to kill a few Tutsis who were outside of the church; in fact, the church was already full.  From my house, we could hear the shouting of the assailants and the people who were at the church; but I cannot tell you how long the attack lasted." 
(Pages 1 to 13 by Donna M. Lewis)


















1530H 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Has the translation been complete?  Have you heard the interpretation?  Now, Witness, that's what you told the Defence investigators in December last year, that you were at home on the afternoon of 15 April where you could hear the cries coming from the church.  So tell me, Witness, were you at the church on Friday the 15th? 
A.	Yes, I was there.  Earlier I told you that I arrived at that place at 11 or 11:30.  In the morning, when I arrived, the confrontations had not yet begun.  When I arrived, there was shouting.  For my part, I arrived at that place at around 11 o'clock and I could see the situation unfold. 
Q.	Yes, but in the afternoon, Witness, you told the Defence investigators that you were at home, didn't you? 
A.	No.  I was at home in the morning before 11 o'clock.  After 11 o'clock I was at the parish.  That's how I explained it.  I don't know if they've made a mistake when they wrote it down, but that was my statement. 
Q.	So what's recorded there, you're saying, is a mistake? 
A.	I said that I heard the crying and shouting in the morning.  In the morning I was at home.  In the afternoon I was at Nyange at the parish.  There is, therefore, no mistake.  Indeed, I heard the noise, the shouting.  That was in the morning.  Then we went to that place because we heard there was unrest, and the situation was not safe, so we wanted ***********the shop. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Objection, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Monthé. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I wanted to share something with your Chamber.  The Prosecution apparently has not read page 5 of the statement of 2 December 2004.  The paragraph of interest to us here is the following:   "From my house we could hear the shouting of the assailants and the people who were at the church, but I cannot tell you how long the attack lasted."  There is no difference between what is said here and what the Prosecutor is getting at. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. MOSES:
That's a matter, Your Honours, that we can argue, no doubt will argue about, at a later period in time.  I'm ready to move on, Your Honours. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, you said in your evidence-in-chief that, on the morning of the 16th of April, you saw leaders going around the hills getting people to go to the church on that morning.  Do you remember saying that? 
A.	No.  Those were not my words.  I've always said that I never saw anyone go and encourage people to flee. 
Q.	Well, I'll read what you said:   "In the morning I saw leaders going around the hill to call people to go to the church.  These people were saying threateningly that people who would not go to the church would be in serious trouble."  Do you remember saying that? 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Objection, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
I don't know where the Prosecution is drawing these words, but this doesn't come from any of the statements made by Witness BZ14 and, furthermore, I don't think he made them in this very room. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, you are reading a document.  Can you please tell us what document you're reading and tell us what the pages and the paragraphs are. 
MR. MOSES:
These are the draft transcripts for the -- for Tuesday the 1st of November 2005.  It's on page -- page 5, as I'm looking at it here, and it's at line 33.  These are the draft English transcripts for his evidence last week. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, first of all, Thursday was not the 1st of November.  The 1st of November was Tuesday.  So we need to agree on what document the Prosecutor is referring to.  That's one.  Two; if he's reading a document, he should give it to us in French.  The references should be given to us in French so that we can follow, because the witness testified in French.  I don't know whether we are dealing with the 1st of November which was a Tuesday, but I heard "Thursday", so he should give us the correct references so that we can follow what he's saying to the witness. 
MR. MOSES:
There may have been a mistranslation.  I thought I'd said Tuesday.  Secondly, this is the Court -- this is what was said in Court.  The witness gave his evidence in Kinyarwandan, not French, and I'm simply putting to him what is recorded as him having said. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I have the draft in French.  I would like to refer to it so that I can verify, at the same time as the Prosecution is, that this is what is said.  He should, therefore, give us the references.  That's what we are asking, and this is what we do normally.  We are not going to look at a Kinyarwandan document which I do not understand and I cannot read. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, the references you gave a moment ago, are these the transcripts in English or in French?  
MR. MOSES:
In English, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, but you should also be able to give us the references of the transcripts in French so that we can follow, if you please. 
MR. MOSES:
I don't believe we have them, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you have the references, Mr. Prosecutor?  
MR. MOSES:
Not -- unfortunately for the -- not -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
For the French transcripts? 
MR. MOSES:
If Your Honour --
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, can I ask the Chamber, under such circumstances, the Prosecutor should give us the question which was asked so that I can look at whether this corresponds with the question which was put, because we can't follow.  We are working in French.  This witness was cross-examined in French, so we would like to know whether what is being said now is, indeed, correct.  It shouldn't be impossible. 
MR. MOSES:
I'm happy to do that, Your Honour, more than happy to read out the question that was asked. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The question, please.  Very well, thank you.  So you can follow, you will be given the question. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, he should be quite specific so that I can try and follow. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	The question is recorded as:  "Thank you.  Now, I am going to ask you, and I would like to emphasise that we are still referring to the 15th of April, when you returned to your home on this 15th of April, when you left the church, what time was it?" The answer the witness gave was:  "When the doors were locked and instructions were given that the attacks should cease, we're talking about these things as if these were ordinary events, but they were really dangerous times.  Actually, I sneaked off, because it was difficult -- it was dangerous to leave the church.  Someone had given me a message which I was to pass on, so I was able to go to my home.  When I went there, I went for night duty as usual, so I left home at about 10 p.m.  I left at about 10 p.m. to go to bed.  In the morning I saw leaders going around the hill to call people to go to the church.  These people were saying threateningly that people who would not go to the church would be in serious trouble.  So, in view of that situation, I went to the church as well.  I went to the church as well."  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Monthé, can you follow in the transcripts that -- what has just been read by the Prosecutor?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Absolutely not, Madam President.  This is a special method of working, and one can't find these things in a hurry.  Maybe it would be a good idea, and this is my suggestion that the Prosecutor should have done, to leave these questions after the break and, in the meantime, we can find the transcripts, because right now I'm lost. 
MR. MOSES:
Perhaps -- perhaps now that I've read the entire question and answer, the most important thing surely is whether the witness remembers the question and answer; it's not whether my friend can locate the question and answer in the transcript.  The most important thing is whether the witness recalls saying that in evidence last week.  If he does, then I can move on with my next question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, did you follow the interpretation in Kinyarwanda?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I did.  However, that's not what I said.  I said -- I never said that there were authorities.  I said that there were people who were moving about and were forcing people to go to the parish.  Rather, these people were criminals who, throughout the morning, had asked that people come to the parish.  I didn't speak about any authorities. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Monthé?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
I have finally found what was said.  Madam President, if you have the draft in French, it's at page 28, and the question is number 37.  If you wish, I can read it. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, could you?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
The question is this.  The answer will come later:  "Thank you.  I now want to ask you, and we're still on the 15th of April, let me repeat, when you went back home on the 15th of April, having left the church, what time was it approximately?"  Answer:    "After the doors were closed and after the instructions were given, according to which the attacks should stop, we were speaking as if these were ordinary events, but these were really dangerous times.  In fact, I escaped.  I had to sneak off in order to be able to leave, because it was dangerous to leave.  Someone gave me a message, and when I got home, I went to the patrols as usual at night and I left at 10 o'clock to go and sleep.  In the morning there were people who were responsible for moving about in the hills, and these people were telling people that, if they did not go to the church, there would be serious problems."  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel was reading a bit fast.  I'm not sure whether I was able to keep up with him. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, do you have anything to add?  The witness is challenging the term "authority". 
MR. MOSES:
I'll leave the issue, Your Honours.  I'll move on. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, Witness, how many days did you go to Nyange -- near to Nyange church during April 1994? 
A.	I went to the parish on two occasions; in other words, the 15th and the 16th of April. 
Q.	On the 16th of April, would you agree that there were at least as many, and possibly more, attackers than were there on the 15th? 
A.	There were attackers, but I am unable to tell you whether there were more in number.  What I can say, however, is that when I arrived there at about 9 o'clock, there were many attackers, and some of them had spent the night there. 
Q.	When you got there, Witness, on the 16th you say you got there, were you amongst the attackers or were you **************** your friend's shop again? 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I raise an objection.  The witness is here in order to shed light on matters for the Tribunal.  He cannot speak about personal attacks, and he has -- the texts of the Tribunal say that he cannot be prosecuted for what he said. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This is what we heard in French, Mr. Prosecutor.  Maybe you did not say that, but that's what we heard.  We heard "attackers".  So please, can you repeat your question?  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	On the 16th of April, did you go there and ********your friend's shop, or did you go there to join in with the attackers who were there? 
MR. MONTHÉ:
The witness has already answered that question.  He said that he went to ************the shop. 
MR. MOSES:
That was in regards to the 15th of April.  I'm now asking about the following day, whether on that day he went to guard the shop or he went there for some other purpose. 
THE WITNESS:
May I proceed?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Could you please repeat what you said because we didn't hear what you said? 
THE WITNESS:
Nothing had changed.  The criminals were still there.  But to answer your question, I went back the following day in order **************the shop.  I didn't go there to participate in the attacks that were perpetrated there. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And did you observe the events of the 16th from a similar position to that where you had observed the events the previous day, namely, the 15th of April? 
A.	No.  I didn't remain there.  I didn't stay on that -- in that place on that day.  I went right up to the parish.  In truth, I had explained to you that someone had remained behind, and I was to protect that person.  Now, on that day I went up to the parish and I was able to follow what -- everything that happened there. 
Q.	I'm wondering if the witness could be shown the photograph which is yet to be produced.  It's a copy of the Prosecution Exhibit 316.  Are you able to see on that photograph the approximate position that you were on the 16th of April, and if you are, could you please mark that with the number 3? 
A.	No, I do not see the place where I was standing at the parish.  But in the event that you have other photographs which show the parish itself, you could show them to me, because I do not see the place where I was standing in the photograph that I have here with me. 
Q.	So we get an idea, are you saying you were standing up towards where the church was, in the vicinity of the church? 
A.	On the 16th I was at the parish itself.  But if you do not have any other photographs which -- that will show us that location, maybe I will try and give you an indication in relation to the photograph that is available. 
Q.	Please do.  
A.	On this photograph I can see a vehicle.  First of all, at one point in time I was at that location.  We normally had the habit of warming up the church drums at this place.  At another time I was in front of the parish secretariat, but I do not see that place in this photograph that I have. 
Q.	Right.  If you could initially mark with the number 3 the position of the vehicle that you have just been referring to, so that we are clear where you say that you were at one stage.  

Would you agree with me, Witness, that the position -- the position that you have indicated is a rather strange place to be *************the shop from, and that it is, in fact, rather more consistent with the position of someone who was part of the -- those who were attacking the church.  

MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I raise an objection.  The witness has already answered this question, saying that he was not an attacker, so he can't be badgered continually with this same question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, do you want to respond to that objection?  
MR. MOSES:
I certainly do, Your Honours.  The witness has said that he went along ********the shop on the 16th.  Your Honours have seen where the shop -- the witness indicated where the shop was.  I've put a proposition, a very fair proposition based on the evidence, namely, that it is a rather unusual position to be at the top of the hill by the church if, in fact, he was there on the 16th *******a shop -- ********* the shop which was nowhere near that position.  That's the proposition I'm putting to him.  It's a rather unusual position to be *********** a shop -- the shop from; whether he can agree with that as a proposition.  

And the follow-on from that is that, the position where he has indicated that he was, is more consistent with that of the position of someone who was taking part in the attack.  I'm being fair and I'm putting it straight to the witness.  He can answer the question "yes" or "no".  He doesn't have to agree with me, but I've got a duty with respect to putting that proposition to him, and for Your Honours to assess his response in light of the question that's been put to him.  It's not unfair at all. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, it's not a question; it's an insinuation.  There is speculation going on here.  The witness has responded by saying, "I went *************** *the shop and **************on it, and that's why I was not standing immobile in front of the church."  Now, there is an interpretation being made that this is a place where the shop was being ********** from, and it is being suggested that he was one of the attackers.  And I am raising an objection because this is an unfair question.  It is insinuating that the witness was one of the attackers. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, the objection is sustained.  We are asking you to reformulate your question, therefore. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, the position that you indicated with number 3, is that the position you were when you were *********** the shop? 
A.	In that particular spot, what I wanted to say is that if I had gone ********** the shop, this didn't mean that I was stuck to the shop as if it were -- as it were.  I could see what was happening, and just a moment ago I wanted to speak to add some information.  I said that, even if I was present in the spot at the time, I had a problem.  My wife belonged to the group of people who were being targeted.  In brief, if I was there ************* *the shop, given the situation, I couldn't limit myself to remaining close to the church.  I needed to keep an eye on what was happening so that I would know how to behave in relation to the person whom I had a duty to protect.  This is what I wanted to add for the benefit of the Chamber. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, do you still have many questions for this witness?  
MR. MOSES:
Perhaps 45 minutes to an hour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  In that case we shall take the break now, and we will resume in 10 to 15 minutes.  The session stands adjourned.  
(Court recessed from 1605H to 1625H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are resumed.  

Mr. Prosecutor, you may proceed with your cross-examination. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, do you agree with me that you never said anything to the Defence in either of the statements that you made on either the 2nd of December last year, or the 10th of March of this year, about being at Nyange on 16 April.  Do you agree you never said you were there on 16 April? 
A.	I was there on the 16th. 
Q.	You didn't tell the Defence investigators on either occasion that you were there on the 16th, did you? 
A.	(No interpretation) 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Objection, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel. 
MR. NEKUIE:
I don't understand, Madam President, why the Prosecutor continues to distort the words and statements of the witness.  When he says that he never said that the witness told the investigators that he was never there on the 16th, that's completely in contradiction with the statement that we have.  He talks about the assailants on page 7, for example, "I confirm that they met."  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, if counsel is going to read, he has to indicate, for the benefit of the interpreters, where he is going to read from. 
MR. NEKUIE:
I was reading a paragraph from page 7.  The witness says -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Which document?  

MR. NEKUIE:
The statement of 2 December 2004, Madam President.  May I proceed?  The witness says, "I confirm that they met the driver of the caterpillar on the pretext that they had --"
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I still cannot locate the paragraph, Madam President. 
MR. NEKUIE:
"At that time --" 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, are you sure this is the statement of 2 December 2004?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, page 7. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Before us, it's on page 6. 
MR. NEKUIE:  
Very well.  Pardon me, Madam President. 

The witness says that, "At that time I was close to the secretariat of the parish, not far from the cyprus hedge."  The witness cannot be more specific with regard to where he was at the time. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. MOSES:
The point I'm trying to make, which I think has been confirmed by my learned friend reading that, is that nowhere does it refer to the date of the 16th of April, which is the point I'm trying to make.  Nothing that my friend read out refers to the 16th of April in any of the statements.  That's the point I'm trying to make and I intend to have part of his other statement read to him to place that in context.  That's the point I'm making, is nowhere in these statements does he refer to being there on the 16th.
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	In fact, Witness, if we can have -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor?  
MR. MOSES:
So I can place this -- the line of questioning in context, and to be fair to the witness, I want to have a portion from his statement of the 2nd of April read out to him, and a line from one paragraph from his second statement read.  So I'm asking the French booth if they could please look at page 5 of the statement of the 2nd of December.  It is the second to last paragraph which commences, "C'est ainsi," and if they could then read to the end of the third paragraph which commences, "Par la suite," on page 6. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
May we begin the reading, Madam President?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That is how, on the 15th of April 1994, in other words, on the Friday in the afternoon, the assailants attacked the church -- attacked the church again.  Since the refugees were able to push back the assailants all the way up to the commercial centre, one of the reservists of the Rwandan armed forces, the FAR, a person called Rukara, went on to the roof of one of the buildings that was close to the commercial centre and threw a grenade into the crowd of refugees.  People were killed.  The survivors again took refuge in the church.  At that time the assailants came to surround entirely the church.  The refugees closed themself (sic) into the church.  The assailants tried to destroy the church, to burn it down, but they did not succeed. 

Later on I saw a caterpillar-type machine arrive.  For me, there was just one caterpillar machine.  It belonged to the Astaldi company.  That company was building the road from Gitarama to Kibuye."  End of paragraph. 
MR. MOSES:
And also, at this stage, if I -- to save time, if the French booth could look at the next statement, namely, the statement of the 10th of March 2005, at page 6, and it's the sixth line down commencing, "J'ai effectivement."  If that sentence could be read to the witness as well. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We've located the passage, Madam President. 

 "I, indeed, was there when the church was destroyed.  That event took place on the 15th of April 1994."  
MR. MOSES:
Have you -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Have you located the page, Counsel?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Madam President.  I simply, with the leave of the Chamber, wanted to remind the Prosecutor that he must refer to the entire text and the entire statement of the witness, the very beginning.  With regard to the dates, the witness says -- and this is on page 2 of that statement.  On page 2, with the leave of the Chamber, I can read some of the reservations that the witness expressed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, he says, "Before I begin my testimony, I should point out to you that I cannot be specific with regard to the dates when the events I was a witness of took place.  That is sufficient reservation given by the witness with regard to the dates.  I simply wanted to point that out for the benefit of the Chamber, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Counsel.  

Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  It seems the witness wants to say something.  Yes, Mr. Witness?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I wanted to say something regarding the Prosecution's proposition.  Nothing has changed in what I have said.  We must not dwell on the dates too much.  I said and told you what happened.  The dates are not really necessary, and the dates aren't important when it's not the dates that killed the victims, for example. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	My question is, Witness, whether you were actually there, or were you recounting what somebody has told to you about what happened at Nyange church? 
A.	Who told me about those events?  Are you denying the fact that I was born in Nyange?  Mr. Prosecutor, I don't know if you're denying the fact that I was born in Nyange. 
Q.	Do I take the answer to my question -- well, what is the answer to my question, Witness?  Were you there or were you recounting to this Trial Chamber something that someone has told you? 
A.	I have said it over and over again since I've arrived at the Tribunal.  I've said that I was on the site on the dates that I mentioned.  It should be clear. 
Q.	Well, Witness, you've also said that you've known -- in your first statement you knew that the 15th of April was a Friday, and yet, in your second statement you said that the church was destroyed on the 15th of April which is the Friday, and that's not correct, is it, Witness? 
A.	I've given my testimony in chronological order.  I didn't take much account of the dates.  But you're dwelling on the date of the 16th.  Let me tell you, I had no idea that I was going to appear before the Chamber.  We shouldn't dwell on that date.  I even told the investigators that I didn't really remember the dates.  For me, they were just details.  I didn't realise how important the dates were. 
Q.	Putting aside the dates, Witness, nowhere in your first statement did you say you went back home and came back the following day, did you?  You said "later", referring immediately after the events on the 15th with Rukara throwing the grenades.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Objection, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
I believe that the Prosecutor has encyclopedic knowledge of English, but French is also used.  When someone says "later" in French, that means "much later".  It could be the next day, even.  If we want to look at the atomology (sic) of "later", we can do so.  We cannot dwell on "later" and put a proposition to the witness based on that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, are you in a position to answer the question?
THE WITNESS:
In Kinyarwanda, when you say "later", it can have two meanings.  I don't know if it's the same in French.  When you are narrating an event and you say, "Later something happened," you might mean that -- I didn't remember the dates.  I didn't know I was going to come here to testify.  I didn't mention the date in question.  But when you say "later", it could mean the next day.  If an event took place on the 15th and I said "later another event took place", in my mind I was thinking of the 16th.  I don't know if that is a satisfactory answer. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor?  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And when in -- earlier this year, in March, you said the church was destroyed on the 15th of April, what did you mean by that? 
A.	That's what I was explaining.  I began with a few reservations regarding the dates.  But if I brought up that date of the 15th, I still had the same hesitation, the same reservations.  I expressed those right at the beginning of my statement.  That's what I wanted to explain. 
Q.	Witness, all right.  During your evidence-in-chief you gave to the Trial Chamber a description or an interpretation of the word "Inkotanyi" and how that was interpreted by people in April of 1994.  Are you able to give a similar description of how the word "Inyenzi" was used in 1994?  When people referred to "Inyenzi", what were they referring to? 
A.	The word "Inyenzi", and it wasn't the first time I heard it at the time, meant Tutsis.  People would use the word when referring to Tutsis.  The word was invented long before we were born.  They meant Tutsis who wanted to attack the country.  And finally, the word was used again. 
Q.	Would you agree that, at the time of these events in April 1994, the reason that Tutsi were being attacked is because all Tutsis were being considered by people as accomplices of the RPF? 
A.	Absolutely. 
Q.	Would you agree with me that there is a difference between RPF guerilla soldiers, and those Tutsi civilians who may have been supporters of the RPF? 
A.	I haven't quite understood the meaning of your question.  Could you repeat it?
Q.	In your evidence-in-chief, you spoke of Father Straton giving food to guerilla soldiers of the RPF; do you remember saying that?  That's what I've got here.  Do you agree that you referred to that? 
A.	Yes, I said that.  But to that effect, I said that somebody told me about that.  People told me that they brought supplies to Ruhango for the guerilla soldiers. 
Q.	Weren't you actually told that they were giving -- he was accused of giving food to Tutsis who were considered accomplices of RPF soldiers, as opposed to giving the food to the guerilla soldiers? 
A.	Yes.  There was a famine people were suffering from.  The people talked about the distribution of those supplies.  People lamented that.  They went home. 
Q.	I want to have read to you from the French booth, if I can, one paragraph.  
MR. MOSES:
I think it's the last paragraph, Your Honours, that I'm going to be referring to from the statement.  This is the statement of the 2nd of December, page 2.  It is the second to last paragraph on the page commencing, "Je dois d'ailleurs."  If I could ask the interpreters now to read and translate that one paragraph. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We begin reading the paragraph:   "I should furthermore point out here that Father Straton, then the parish priest of the parish was, at that time, in other words in 1994, accused of misappropriating CARITAS assistance or supplies to the benefit of Tutsis from Ruhango who were considered as collaborators with the Inyenzi; in other words, members of the RPF.  It was said that was why there was discord between Father Seromba and the parish priest."  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Do you remember saying words like that to the Defence in December last year? 
A.	I spoke about those matters, but some of the things don't correspond with what I stated.  I said that at the time the people were complaining and said that the supplies were given over to those Inyenzis.  I didn't say that he was accused anywhere.  I didn't say that he was accused of doing that.  People were simply complaining.  The people were saying that, "We are short of supplies because Father Straton is bringing them to the Inyenzis."  But Father Straton wasn't accused anyway. 
Q.	Is it fair, Witness, to draw from that paragraph and what you have said today that, according to what you'd heard, Father Seromba didn't approve of assistance being given to these Tutsis who were considered RPF supporters? 
A.	I beg your pardon?  What did you say?
Q.	Was the reason for the dispute, according to what you had been told, between Father Seromba and Father Straton, was that because Father Seromba didn't approve of Father Straton giving assistance to Tutsis who were considered as RPF supporters.  Is that, according to you, the reason for the dispute between Father Seromba and Father Straton? 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I wish to object to this question.  The witness said that the population was unhappy because it didn't have supplies or food, and that the supplies had been given to them -- had been given by Father Straton to the Inyenzi.  It was never said that this was the objective or the subject of dispute between Father Straton and Father Seromba. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
There was mention made of a dispute, Mr. Witness.  We want to know what is the origin of that dispute.  Can you please tell us, if you can?  
THE WITNESS:
Since I was present, that dispute was claimed that by the members of the population, because they claim that they didn't have any food.  But I don't know whether there was any discord or dispute between the two -- two priests, and I don't know where the members of the population drew that claim from.  I heard the people say that there was a dispute between the two priests given the fact that the supplies had been diverted. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  You may proceed, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. MOSES:
All right. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, towards the end of your evidence-in-chief, you said, did you not, that you believed that the authorities were sufficiently powerful to prevent the events from taking place if they had wanted to.  Do you remember saying that in evidence towards the end? 
A.	Yes, I did make that statement. 
Q.	Is it your position that, because the authorities chose not to intervene, that, in your mind at least, is evidence of the fact that those authorities wanted the Tutsis at Nyange church killed? 
A.	That was the wish.  That was the desire.  How would it be that these authorities attacked the church?
Q.	Ndungutse, you've said on many occasions, was involved in the attacks on the Tutsis; that's correct, isn't it? 
A.	Pardon?  
Q.	I will repeat the question.  Do you agree with me that you've said on a number of occasions that Ndungutse was involved in the attacks at Nyange church and elsewhere, is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I confirm that he was involved in those attacks. 
Q.	Similarly, Fulgence Kayishema, the IPJ, he was, according to you, I think, always with the people who were attacking the church, is that correct? 
A.	Yes, quite so. 
Q.	And Ndahimana, who was in charge of the commune, and the communal police, he was also -- I think you said he was always with Ndungutse, according to what you've said in your evidence-in-chief, do you agree with that? 
A.	That is correct. I still stand by my statement. 
Q.	These people were all authorities who you say were involved in the attacks on the Tutsi at Nyange parish, is that right? 
A.	Yes, that's right. 
Q.	Were you aware that Mr. Seromba had met these people on several occasions in the days prior to the destruction of the church and the killing of the Tutsis at Nyange? 
A.	I don't know anything about that.  I wasn't a witness to that event, nor did I hear any mention made of it. 
Q.	All right.  In your evidence-in-chief, you said that there were no ties between Mr. Seromba and Kayishema; that Kayishema was always with his driver, Kituku (phonetic), and he was always moving about in his vehicle, so that he had no contact or connection with Seromba.  Do you remember saying that in your evidence-in-chief? 
A.	I remember. 
Q.	Were you with Kayishema at all times in the days leading up to and the days of the attack at Nyange parish -- days of attacks? 
A.	On several occasions I would see Kayishema moving about, be it in our neighbourhood or elsewhere.  Almost every day I would see him moving around. 
Q.	But you weren't with him at all times during those days, were you? 
A.	No, I didn't say that I was with him.  I would see him when he was moving about.  Consequently, I was not with him.  I could see him pass by, and later on I could probably see him coming back using the same route, but I wasn't with him. 
Q.	And as a consequence of that answer, it's fair to say that you don't know what he was doing or who he was meeting at all times during that period leading up to, and involving, the attacks at Nyange church; that's correct, isn't it? 
A.	Yes.  In fact, I cannot confirm that he met such and such a person, because I was not in his company as he moved around. 
Q.	But you do, in fact, say in your evidence that he'd had no contact with Seromba.  So bearing in mind your last answer, my final question for you, Witness, is, do you still maintain, as you did at the end of your evidence-in-chief, that you have added nothing to your evidence to make Father Seromba seem innocent? 
A.	I said that he had not met Father Seromba, because I never saw them together.  If per chance they met one another, Father Seromba is present, he's going to tell you about that, but personally, I never saw them together.

1700H 
MR. MOSES: 
     Thank Your Honour.  That's the end of my cross-examination of the witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  

Defence, does the Defence have any re-examination of this witness? 
MR. MONTHÉ:  
No, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, you have come to the end of your testimony before this Tribunal.  We thank you for having agreed to come, and for having answered the questions that were put to you.  We wish you a safe return back home. 
THE WITNESS:
I also wish to thank you.  I thank you because you have had confidence in me, and you allowed me to appear as a witness before this Tribunal.  I simply wish to say that Father Seromba is innocent.  

Lastly, I would like to ask you to allow me to say hello to Father Seromba.  Also, I would request that the Tribunal provides me with the document testifying to the fact that I appeared before this Tribunal as a witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Monthé. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Yes, Madam President, Your Honours, I would like to reassure the witness and tell him that we have already gotten in touch with the relevant section, and he will be authorised to meet Father Seromba.  

As for the document, this is also a matter for the section, and we are working on it, and we will inform the witness once this is done because Madam President, Your Honours, you are quite aware that we cannot contact the witness or before his cross-examination is not finished. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Please be patient for a little while more, Mr. Witness, because you have heard that efforts are going to be made to provide answers to your request.  

Do you have something to say, Mr. Prosecutor? 

MR. MOSES:
Yes, Your Honour, the second document, I don't believe was formally produced. I just think it might be appropriate we do that.  Now, while the witness is still here.  And, I have asked that the document which is a copy of Prosecution Exhibit 316, be produced as Prosecutor Exhibit 30.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
Mr. Monthé, you are not in any objection to the request made by the Prosecutor regarding the document. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, you know that we prefer - - so we don't have any objection.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Very well.  Thank you.  Thank you.  The document P. 316 which is shown to the witness is admitted as a Prosecution document - - as a reference P. 30. 
(Exhibit No. P. 30 admitted)  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, we thank you and you may take leave of the Court.  
(Witness is excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Prosecutor, are you now going to cross-examine, Witness BZ4, is that the case? 
MR. MOSES:   
That is correct, Your Honour, I will have to be much, much shorter than I was with the previous witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Mr. Prosecutor.  Please could you usher in Witness BZ4?    

Good afternoon, Witness BZ4. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You were examined in chief by the Defence, and as we have told you today, it will be the turn of the Prosecution to cross-examine you.  We remind you that you are still under oath and that you listen carefully to the questions put to you and respond as concisely and precisely as possible. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecution, your witness for his cross-examination.  This is Witness BZ4. 
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honours. 

WITNESS BZ4
CROSS-EXAMINATION  
BY MR. MOSES:  
Q.	Witness, do you confirm before the Trial Chamber that you first met the Defence investigators for the Accused in this trial, Athanase Seromba on the 4th of December 2004, when you made and signed a statement for them? 
A.	Yes, I confirm that.
Q.	And I think you met with them again on the 9th of March, this year, and made a second statement which you signed; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that's correct, I confirm that. 
Q.	And -- sorry, my understanding from your evidence-in-chief was that the first day that you had gone to Nyange church, during the events of April 1994, was on the day when there was some fighting, an attack on the refugees and someone got on the roof of the building and threw some grenades at the refugees.  Did that incident -- can you confirm to me that that incident happened on the first day that you went to Nyange parish? 
A.	Yes, it was on that day that I had gone onto that place. 
Q.	And in December last year, when you were spoken to by the Defence investigators, you indicated to them that you weren't good at dates, but that you thought it was the 12th of April that that incident happened.  Do you remember saying that to the Defence in December last year? 
A.	No.  I said that this incident happened after the 12th.  I would never have said the incident took place on the 12th.  It was after the 12th.
MR. MOSES:
I wonder if the French booth can look at the statement they have in their booth of the 4th of December, on page 4, and the 5th paragraph of that statement which commences, "Le jour suivant-".   And, if I can read that in the following paragraph.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
I believe, Your Honours, that the interpreters are not with the references provided by the Prosecutor.  If he could kindly repeat.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, can you kindly repeat your question for the interpreters? 
MR. MOSES:   
Sorry, I apologise to the English booth because the French statement had only one extra copy which I have given to the French booth so that they can read out the French -- the part that I am asking for to be read in French and then the translation is found on page 4 of the statement for BZ4, dated the 
4th of December 2004.  It's the -- sorry, the 5th paragraph down, 5th and 6th paragraphs, I would like it translated, the 5th paragraph commences, "Le jour suivant," and then the 6th paragraph, "Qui, les refugees". "The following day, namely the 12th of April 1994, the attackers came from Kigali and from Gisenyi préfecture in order to attack the refugees at the church.  They were armed with traditional weapons and they were singing.  The attackers assembled at the commercial centre and started throwing stones at the refugees.  The latter opened the windows of the church to tell the attackers that they were ready to defend themselves and then the refugees came out of the church in order to go and fight the attackers who were at the commercial  centre.  And as they went on their way, a young man climbed on the roof of one of the buildings.  He threw a grenade in the middle of the refugees causing great damage.  The refugees then retreated and they went to barricade themselves within the church. 
I am sure it means - - by loudly closing the doors.  Some of the refugees went to the presbytery, others to the forest."
BY MR. MOSES:   
Q.	All right.  Now, Witness, I know, and to be fair to you, at the beginning of that statement you had said you weren't good at dates, but you did say to the Defence, in December last year, that it was on the 
	12th of April that the incident happened; didn't you? 
A.	I never said that this incident took place on the 12th.  Rather, I said that the incident took place after the 12th, but I did not know the exact date. 
Q.	You will agree that's not what the statement said that we just have read out to us? 
A.	I think I clearly explained that it was not necessary to insist on dates because these events took place a long time ago.  One cannot remember all those dates today. 
Q.	Very well.  You did, however, when Mr. Monthé was - - my learned friend was asking you questions last week in evidence-in-chief, that he suggested to you that the event took place on the 15th of April and you agreed.  Now, has your memory improved in the last or you were simply agreeing with what has been suggested to you as the date the event took place? 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Objection, Madam President.  Madam President, by your leave, I would like to remind the Prosecutor that the problem of memory is one which has been resolved by your Tribunal in its jurisprudence and this is something that happens for witnesses who recount events of which they were witnesses long ago and for the present witness, when we were examining BZ14, we said that a full reading of statements that he had made should be made.  As for Witness BZ4, at the beginning of his statement, he said - - stated that he was relating the events as they happened chronologically.  He did not want to rely on the dates because he was not able to recount them exactly.  So, if we are going to use the text of his statement, and use it piecemeal to insinuate that the witness was not right in what he was saying while he was making the statement, it's not appropriate.    These are insinuations that were coming from the Prosecution, Madam President, and Your Honours.  
MR. MOSES: 
If the witness in his evidence-in-chief had said, "I don't know what date it is," in answer to the question that was put to him, suggesting it was the 15th, I wouldn't take any issues with that.  But the witness has said in his evidence-in-chief, he has agreed that it took place on the 15th whereas earlier, he has indicated, he is not sure of dates.  Now, either his memory has improved or someone is saying it because it has been suggested to him.  That's the point I am trying to make, and have the witness answer and that is the question I raised with him.  It's perfectly a fair question.  I have tried to be fair in the way I phrased because, as Your Honour will recall, I said to the witness that I am aware, at the beginning of his statement he said that he was not good at dates.  So, I haven't tried to mislead him as to what he has said in this statement, but he has made an assertion that this took place on a particular date when he gave evidence last week which is different from the assertion which he has made earlier.  Hence my question is this a date you have given simply because it has been suggested to you or has his memory improved.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam President, I would like to reply by saying that even the suggestion, if it were to be considered of last year, and the answers given were with the same reservations on the dates.  It cannot be said that his memory has suddenly improved concerning dates.  The witness is the one who has made this statement. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we wish to remind you that we are professional judges.  We are aware of what is noted here.  It is said around the 12th of April, and the witness has said that he does not remember the dates exactly, but the Prosecutor is asking his questions and the witness should be allowed to answer them.  The witness will explain himself certainly.  

Mr. Witness, can't you please answer the question which is being put to you by the Prosecutor.  Can you remember the question put to you?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I do recall, I remember the question very well.  I said that this incident came about during the period beginning from the 12th and the following dates.  So, what I am saying is that it was during that period of time, beginning from the 12th and the days that followed.  It was during that period of time. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Madam, I don't want to put words in your mouth.  Witness, can I take it from there, you don't know what day, and it was.  You are not sure which day it was that the grenades were thrown? 
A.	You told me that you were basing yourself on the content of the statement.  
Q.	Can you answer my question, Witness:  Do you know what date it was that you first went to the church when the grenades were thrown at the refugees, a simple question? 
A.	Earlier, I gave you an answer.  Everything is contained in the statement that you have in front of you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, you said that you gave the answer earlier, just repeat your answer. 
THE WITNESS:
I said that that incident occurred between the date of the 12th and the following days.  Now, if it was on the 15th, the 15th follows in that four o'clock time that I gave and that there is no contradiction in what 
I am saying.
BY MR. MOSES:  
Q.	Can you tell us what day of the week it was? 
A.	I don't remember the day. 
Q.	Approximately, what time did you arrive? 
A.	I don't remember the exact time, but it was in the afternoon. 
Q.	All right.  I know you said in your evidence-in-chief, you couldn't put a number on a number of the attackers that was there at the church, at Nyange, but if I suggested to you that there were several thousands, possibly as many as 10,000 attackers, would you disagree with me? 
A.	I can't confirm that.  You have your own reasons for putting forth such a figure, but I told you that I never had an opportunity to make an estimate of how many assailants they were.
Q.	It's not a tricky question, Witness; I am -- if I suggested there were several thousand attackers, and would you disagree with that? 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Objection, Madam President.  The witness has already answered the question.  He said that he cannot give an estimate of the number of assailants. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, the Prosecution has put a suggestion to the witness.  I think that that witness is in a position to shed light on the matter before the Court.  I believe that we should trust the witness more in these matters for his answers, Mr. Monthé.
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, it has nothing to do with trust.  I believe that the witness has already convinced us.  It's a question of practice.  It's a common law method where they suggested to somebody who speaks Kinyarwanda; something suggested that he doesn't understand.  That is the reason his answers are not good, that they are distorted, the same questions are being asked.  Why doesn't the Prosecution simply ask directly and not make suggestions to the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, are you in a position to rephrase your question and be more direct? 
BY MR. MOSES:  
Q.	Is it your evidence, Witness, that you are not in a position to make any estimate at all on the number of attackers that was there on the day that the grenade was thrown?  
A.	No, really, I can't estimate their number.  I know they were many.  
Q.	Can we take it from there that you weren't paying particular attention to the attackers that day? 
A.	No, I didn't have the time to watch and then figure out how many assailants there were.  There was a war on.  It wasn't peacetime, Counsel. 
Q.	In your evidence-in-chief, you had said that you had gone to Nyange that day -- correct me if I am wrong, to see how the situation would develop.  Is that what you said last week, the reason you went to Nyange that day? 
A.	Yes, events were taking place in my area, and so I wanted to follow closely on what was going on. 
Q.	And you are saying that you didn't go there to take part in the attack yourself? 
A.	No.  I didn't go there to participate in any attacks.  That was not my purpose.
Q.	In any event, your purpose wasn't to go along there to look for Father Seromba; was it? 
A.	No.  That was not my purpose.
Q.	How long after you arrived did the -- were the grenades thrown at the refugees, approximately, how long? 
A.	Frankly, Counsel, I can't give an estimate for how long, I can't tell you. 
Q.	I am not wanting you to narrow down to five seconds, a minute, guideline, wasn't it around an hour, more than an hour, less than an hour?  You have to get some general idea of the time period? 
A.	No, I am not in a position to give you any estimate whatsoever. 
Q.	Not why? 
A.	If I was in a position to do so I would have done it.  You know the whole country was unsafe including the area where I was.  Really, I can't give you that type of information, those types of details.  I didn't follow it closely enough to the extent that I would be able to give you an estimate of the amount of time. 
Q.	Seeing grenades thrown into a group of people, is that something that you have seen a lot before, the date of the 15th or the date that you went along on this day? 
A.	It was the first time since I was born that I saw such things in my area. 
Q.	Rather significant of the incident, would you agree with me? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you still can give no indication at all to the Trial Chamber how long it was after you arrived there that the significant event took place; is that right? 
A.	Yes, I told you that I cannot give you an estimate of the time. 
Q.	Do I understand that you went to the Nyange commercial centre, that is where you went on that day or close to it? 
A.	Yes, that's correct.  I did go to the Nyange commercial centre. 
MR. MOSES:
I would like now, if we could have the witness shown the photocopy, of the Prosecution Exhibit P. 12.
BY MR. MOSES:  
Q.	Now, Witness, do you recognise the scene shown on that photograph and perhaps if I can assist that the building towards the rear of that photograph we have come to know as the Codekoki building, would that knowledge -- are you able to recognise what is shown on the photograph? 
A.	Yes, I can identify what is on this photographer for you. 
Q.	And do you confirm that it also shows, at least part of the Nyange commercial centre, on the 
	foreground of the photo? 
A.	On the photograph, you can see part of the Nyange commercial centre. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Monthé. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
The Defence believes that the witness should indicate exactly which part of the commercial centre he has seen. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Monthé, I think the Prosecutor was getting to that.

Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, looking at that photograph, are you able to see where you were on the day in question, the day that the grenade was thrown?  Were you able to see the approximate area where you were? 
A.	In front of the Codekoki building, there is a statute of the Virgin Mary.  I was close to that area. 
Q.	What I am going to ask the Registry to do is to give you a pen and if you could please mark with a 
	Number One, the spot near the building that you referred to, where you said you were on that day?  Now, I think you told the Trial Chamber last week, it was -- I think you mentioned it again just a few moments ago that it was a very dangerous situation.  Did you remain in the vicinity of where you have just marked during the entire period that you were there, on the day that the grenade was thrown, or did you move closer to where the attackers were by the church? 
A.	I didn't remain in the same spot.  I couldn't stand there for long.  I had to go back and do something else.  When the grenade was thrown and when the confrontation began, I set off home. 
Q.	Very good.  Thank you for that.  And, if I can - - you now have been shown a photocopy of 
	Prosecution Exhibit 316.  And can you recognise that photograph, the same shown on that photograph, Witness? 
A.	Yes, I can identify what's on this photograph. 
Q.	And can you also see the building on the left-hand side, as set on the back of the building that houses the statue of Mary? 
A.	Yes, I have identified that building. 
Q.	Perhaps, if you could mark with Number 1, the position that you were on that day, on this particular photo as well? 
A.	On the first photograph, it was the main facade of the building that houses the statue.  But on this photograph, you see the back of the building in question. 
Q.	Already - - be able to put a mark at Number 1, the approximate, the approximate position that you were at, and if you could please place so that we don't have to waste too much time, if you can mark with Number 2, the position where Nyange church was, in 1994, if you were able to see the approximate position that it was.  

Sorry, are you done so that you can have a quick look at that?  
A. 	Thank you. 
Q.	Now, Witness, did I understand your evidence last week when you said you didn't see any priests on that day; am I correct? 
A.	I saw no priests on that day.
(Pages 29 to 37 by Petrus Chijarira)





























1750H 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	You know both Father Nturiye and Father Kayiranga, don't you?  
A.	I know Father Ntureye. 
Q.	Do you know Father Kayiranga? 
A.	Yes, I know him as well. 
Q.	And you didn't see either of them that day; is that your evidence? 
A.	I didn't see any of them on that day. 
Q.	Do you accept that it is possible that they both were at some stage just before the grenades were thrown at the refugees, that they were up near -- near the church office, and that you didn't or couldn't see them at that time?  Do you agree that it is possible that they were there and you just couldn't or didn't see them? 
A.	Father Nturiye was no longer at Nyange parish; he had been called back for other duties.  Now with regard to Kayiranga, I can't say one way or the other. 
Q.	So, you can't exclude the possibility that Kayiranga was there beforehand, but you simply were not able to see him; is that fair? 
A.	I have no idea about Kayiranga.  I didn't speak about him. 
Q.	That wasn't my question though, Witness.  I'm simply suggesting to you that from the position where you were it is possible that he was up by the church office before the grenades were thrown but that you didn't or couldn't see him; is that possible? 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Objection.  Madam President, the witness said that he saw no priests, that he didn't see Nturiye and Kayiranga.  He didn't see any priest.  Why are we dwelling on this?  It is clear. 
MR. MOSES:
I'm wanting -- I hope it is clear, Your Honours, from what I am hearing Your Honours, I'm pleased if it is not.  Your Honours, I'm simply putting a proposition that it is possible that there were people who were there that he didn't see.  It is not a difficult proposition for the witness to answer.  I thought it was actually a simple proposition for him to accept, it may not be.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, I think we have a problem of understanding here.  He is using double negatives, "I didn't see any priests."  He said.  He can't use double negatives and expect it to be clear,            Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, have you understood the question put to you by the Prosecution?  And if so, please answer it. 
THE WITNESS:
I answered that Father Nturiye was not in that location.  And then I said with regard to Kayiranga, I didn't know whether or not he was there. 
MR. MOSES:
With respect, Your Honours, that doesn't answer my question.  My question was whether the witness accepted as a possibility that Kayiranga or Nturiye was there before the attack with the grenades, but that he simply couldn't or didn't see them.  And it is an important question I want answered with respect to my learned friend -- to the witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Father Nturiye was not on that site.  With regard to Father Kayiranga, I don't know whether or not he was there. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Therefore, it is possible, isn't it, that he was there and you didn't see him, or couldn't see him.  That is possible, isn't it? 
A.	I have no idea.  I said that I do not know whether or not he was there. 
Q.	We will take note of your response to that question.  Do you accept that it is possible that Mr. Seromba was there, but that you didn't or couldn't see him on that day? 
A.	I couldn't see him.  And to be able to see him I would have had to go to the church.  And from where I was to the church there were so many people, they were participating in the attacks. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Approximately how long did you stay at Nyange that day?  Are you able to -- I know you said you couldn't answer how long it was before the grenades were thrown, but are you able to give any indication at all as to the total length of time you were at Nyange from the time you arrived to the time you left? 
A.	I never estimated how long I spent there.  What I do know is I didn't stay for long. 
Q.	Would you agree with me that after the refugees were attacked that day, they went back inside of the church and stayed there barricaded inside until you did leave? 
A.	I don't think I have understood your question, Counsel.  Could you repeat it for me?  
Q.	Certainly.  After the grenades were thrown, did the refugees go back inside of the church and barricade themselves inside of the church? 
A.	After the grenade was thrown, the refugees ran back into the church and barricaded themselves inside, but I left straight away; it was unsafe.  Later on I was told that, after the grenades was thrown, the refugees closed themselves inside of the church. 
Q.	And would you agree that the people -- you have told us you weren't involved and you were a spectator, as it were, of the events, and that you left because you were scared when the grenade was thrown.  Would it be fair to assume that the people you left behind were all attackers, those that wanted to stay and be involved in the attack on the refugees? 
A.	Most of the people who were there were attackers, but there were also onlookers who were looking at the development of things. 
MR. MOSES:
Your Honours, I have now finished with that day.  I have got not a lot to go, perhaps 30 minutes.  I note the time.  And I'm happy to finish this witness now, but that may require staying beyond the time at which everyone is happy to stay.  So -- I may need only 15 or 20 minutes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, we are now going to rise and you will continue with your cross-examination tomorrow.  After this witness, what would be your next one to cross-examine tomorrow?  
MR. MOSES:
BZ5, followed by BZ1.  And then there would be new evidence-in-chief led.  And I think for the benefit of WVSS and it would be best to prepare to have all of those witnesses brought, because I don't -- I don't think that we will take all of the afternoon to complete this witness and do the next two.  So, it may be safe to, at least, prepare the new witness to be brought for later in the day. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	Thank you Mr. Prosecutor, I believe the Defence already has a witness on site who we can maybe take on after the cross-examination is done with those two other witnesses. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam Witness -- Madam President, according to the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, there is a possibility for re-examination.  It is not because -- thus far we have not done so, that it should be assumed that we will not.  We are going to say that you should do your job and you should -- and we will do ours.  And we thank you for your advice. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is the Chamber that is asking you what your next witnesses will be.  Obviously, you have the right to re-examine your witnesses, but we will still be asking these questions after cross-examination. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, we had said that we have YA1, and that will be the next witness.  But for the time being, I want to know what will happen to BZ5 and BZ1 who are to come and BZ4 who is on the stand. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will take the necessary measures if we will close with these examine -- cross-examination before we proceed with the examination-in-chief of that witness.  This was in order that the necessary measures be taken by the WVSS.  We thank you all.

Mr. Witness, we remind you that you are still under oath.  And tomorrow the Prosecution is going to continue with the cross-examination.  And when he will have done with the cross-examination you may be re-examined by the Defence, which has the right of re-examination.  

         We thank you, one and all, have a good evening.  And this session is adjourned until tomorrow at          2 p.m.  Thank you.
(Court adjourned at 1807H)
