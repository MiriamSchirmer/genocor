MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session.  Good morning ladies and gentlemen. 

Counsel Monthé, I think you're supposed to be proceeding with the cross-examination of the witness.  

Witness, we should remind you that you're under solemn declaration and Counsel Monthé will continue to ask you questions, and you're invited to answer as concisely and briefly as possible to the questions that are put to you.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President. 

Madam President, Your Honours, ladies and gentlemen, good morning.  

If I were to begin these proceedings this morning without telling you what I'm feeling, I wouldn't be fitful or loyal to your Chamber.  What happened yesterday afternoon, at the end of the hearing in this courtroom, is unacceptable to me.  Madam President, I cited a judgement of the Court of Appeal of Ruhengeri that was criticised by the witness alleging that the judges had been bribed, relying on the transcripts.  He -- the witness said that the judges had been bribed and this was not pointed out.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Weren't you hearing, Mr. Witness?  Can you hear what is being said now? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Monthé, the witness here present told the Chamber yesterday that the judgement we're referring to, and that had been entered into the records, was (unintelligible) that had been made by corrupt judges and that the state of Rwanda had asked for the review of that trial.  And I think this is a very important accusation before a court.  He was not called to order.  The Chamber did not react.  The Defence that cited that judgement was shocked because there's no worse accusation than to say that judges are corrupt.  That ruling was rendered in Rwanda under the conditions that are known by Tutsi judges, judging Hutus of who merely applied the rules of law.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, our feelings here, and this is the feeling of the Defence, upon whom I'm talking now, that -- our feeling therefore is that the equality of arms is beginning to -- look to be lacking.  We believe that for a trial like this, there shouldn't be any rush.  The path to justice, under the circumstances, must be traced in the offices of the magistrates without any hurry, and this is very fundamental to us.  We feel that if the Defence cannot continue to proceed with this trial on the basis of a fair and equitable trial, I think we would be -- we would be running away from our responsibility before history.  And this is what a gentleman said: "I'm sure to be talking on behalf of the entire international community by expressing the hope that this judgement will contribute to the lasting process of national consideration in Rwanda for there can be no healing in the absence of peace, and there can be no peace in the absence of justice.  You know, justice, when human rights and the primacy of the law are not respected -- and this was the statement made by the secretary-general Kofi Annan.  This is what I had to say this morning, Madam.  After 24 years of practice, I have trained some lawyers and there were some of them in the (unintelligible), and I think I deserve some respect here.  This is what I wanted to say.  If I didn't say this, I wouldn't have been loyal towards you.  Thank you very much.  I think I can continue to with my cross-examination now.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I would also like to tell you that we respect everybody here.  We respect the lawyers; we respect the prosecutors, and we respect the witness.  And I think if each and everyone made that effort of respecting everyone else, there wouldn't be any problem, but the slippages come from all quarters and that's why we are facing the difficulty we are facing.  That witness definitely talked about corrupt judges, if I understood him well, unless I'm mistaken, and it is the authorities in Rwanda who had considered that those judges had been bribed and that -- I think he was talking about appeal, but all of this is due to the fact that the witness tends to (unintelligible) a lot his statements and address his -- and generally, there are questions that are put to him that do not comply with questions that, as the witness is -- during cross-examination.  Probably we understand that that's why -- we probably understand that it's because you want to test the credibility of the witness, but I think that questions that the Defence -- that the Chamber has not always allowed the Defence to ask, but we are concerned with having a good trial and we, therefore, are concerned with respecting the rights of the Defence, and that is why we have been so patient to the extent that we have been able to withstand all slippages and discourteousness simply because we want to ensure that the trial proceeds normally.  So I think we have to comply with the rules that must be applicable in a courtroom.  And I think if everybody made that effort, as I said earlier on, there wouldn't be any problem because the judges in general do not even express themselves.  They are there to make sure that everything works for the better.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, apparently the witness has raised his hand.  Yes, Witness.
THE WITNESS:
The problem that I'm facing and that he's just raised concerning the priest's trial to which he made reference -- I'm talking about the priests that were judged before the Rwandan courts.  I don't know if I agree with the document that was presented to me.  I can even call it a tract.  But from the best of my knowledge, no document is issued by a court without bearing a seal.  The document that was presented to me doesn't bear the seal of the Tribunal, so I do not acknowledge it.  

Now, as concerned the corruption of the judges that I mentioned, I think that concerns the Rwandan state.  I think we are dealing here with the Seromba trial, and I don't know why he is dealing with trials that took place in Rwanda.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we would like to appeal to you once again to merely answer the questions that are put to you because the more you say, the more questions we'll have to put to you obviously because you have to justify all that you would have said.  So, please, stick to the questions that were put to you in the sense that you should merely answer the questions that are put to you. 

Counsel Monthé, you have the floor. 
WITNESS CBJ
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, in the transcripts of Monday, 11 October 2004, on page 42, thereof, line 29, concerning the examination-in-chief of the Prosecutor, the question was put to -- this question was put to the witness: "What words did you hear Father Seromba say on that day, that is, on the 13th of April, it is a Wednesday?"  

The witness's answer was as follows: "He was making a phone call and I heard the person talking on the other end of the phone line." 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Counsel Monthé, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that we were in closed session yesterday and any questions that you have to put through -- put to the witness today will be in open session because we are in open session.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I have a question that I would like to ask in open session and then we can go back into closed session.  In any case, it wasn't lifted by the time we closed yesterday.  I have talked to the registrar and he said he was going to ask your opinion.  I thought you had come to an understanding. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I was saying, therefore, that I had just received a word from the registrar, and so I'm putting this question back to you because we haven't discussed this.  So we'll let you ask your question.
MR. MONTHÉ:
This question can be asked in open session, after which I will request that we move into closed session.

So with your authorisation, Madam President, I will repeat the question that I asked before. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, do you have a problem? 
MR. TOWNSEND:
If counsel could just repeat the page number, please.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, it has to deal with the transcripts of Monday.  I think there is an error on the date because Monday was the 11th, but they have put the 12th.  It is page 42, line 29 of that transcript of Monday, the 11th.  Page 42, line 29. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That is the French transcript, of course.  You don't have the reference for the English transcripts? 
MR. MONTHÉ:
No, Madam President, unfortunately.
MR. TOWNSEND:
I have the official transcript in French, and the examination began on page 48, so is counsel reading from the draft or from the official?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is it page 42 or 48 because I think you talked of page 42.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Well, what I have is page 42; it is a draft. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Fine, then, you may proceed.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Question by the Prosecutor to the witness: "What did you hear Father Seromba say on that day, that is, on the 13th of April, it was a Wednesday?"

The witness's answer is as follows: "He was making a phone call and I heard people talking at the other end of the phone line and they were asking him about news of Nyange and were asking him about the situation prevailing where he was."
MR. MONTHÉ:
On the next page, Madam President, it is said, and this is where the question is of some concern for me.  "He was called and he was told the names of priests that had been killed.  There were many priests and amongst those priests, the name of Sylvère Mutiganda was mentioned to who had been killed in the Murunda parish.  At that time, I was standing up in the company of the younger brother of Mutiganda whose name was Rwagasore." 

I will end here, Madam President, because I would like to show to your Chamber that I asked the question to the witness yesterday as to whether he was maintaining that statement and he said no.  Madam President, I would like you to give leave to the registrar to come to the Defence bench to take this document which shows that Father Mutiganda had died well before the date he stated. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, can you go and retrieve the document, please.
MR. MONTHÉ:
My question therefore is as follows; that is, the question I am putting to the witness relying on the document I've just presented to you. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Mr. Witness, Father Mutiganda, Silvère had died before you came to the parish with his brother Rwagasore.  How can you explain to the Chamber that on the 13th his father had not known that his brother had died -- that his brother had not yet known that his brother, the priest, had died?
A.	Thank you.  I wish to correct a mistake.  You said that I made that statement and I mentioned the 13th of 1994; that is not correct.  It is not on the 13th of April as your document is showing.  You said you interviewed me on the 13th of April 1994, so you should correct that.  

Now, I'm going to answer your question:  it was on the 11th of April 1994; that is what I said, but there's something that you have to understand.  There was a telephone conversation and it was said that Mutiganda had died, and you have proof that the time that the phone call was being made.  You, yourself, say that at the time the phone call was being made, he had already died, but then if you ask me the question to the effect that he was still alive while the phone call was being made, that would be important to me.  The news according to which Mutiganda had died -- Silvère had died on the 11th and somebody can learn of it much later.  A person may want to give a piece of news to Seromba at a later date than when the thing happened, but at the time that the phone call was made, it wasn't said that Mutiganda was still alive.  The information according to which Mutiganda had been killed was still valid because -- I don't know -- according to you, I don't know when they should have stopped telling the information to somebody who wasn't aware of it.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you.  Madam President, I would like to enter this document as Defence Exhibit under number D. 27.  Can the registrar come forward?

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is it the document that we saw a while ago ?
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you have any objection, Prosecutor?
MR. TOWNSEND:
I have no objection to its admissibility, Your Honours.  If counsel can just identify that it is a photocopy of a book.  If he can identify the title of the book, the date, and that it is a one-page photocopy.  As a point of procedure, as well, we've given notice that we seek to inspect, as is our reciprocal right as the Defence has inspected, and we gave notice of that, and we put it in writing yesterday, and the Defence is springing documents on us today.  As a matter of procedure, if he seeks to introduce exhibits through the witnesses, he should be giving us a copy or at least telling us when we can see those documents.  Thank you, Your Honours.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  Has the document been admitted?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we would like to have the date.  Apparently it is a book.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Well, if the registrar can come.  I had only sent you this book and I thought you had taken the titles thereof.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, we only looked at the page you indicated to us.  We'd like to have the references thereof.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Well, I will send the book to you so that you can have it before you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are requesting that we admit the excerpt, a photocopy of which you gave to us.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, it is page 91 of this book by Neno Contran.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very good.  This document is admitted as Defence Exhibit under reference number D. 27. 
(Exhibit No. D. 27 admitted)
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.
MR. TOWNSEND:
If we could have the title of the book.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think Counsel Monthé will disclose the title of the book to you.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Registrar, please.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Just for the transcript, Your Honours.  I just need him to read the name.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Well and good.  So the title of the book is, "They are the Target."  It is a book by Neno Contran with a subtitle "200 African Priests Killed."  "200 African Priests Killed."  

Madam President, at this stage of my cross-examination, I wish to request from the Chamber if we can go into closed session so that I can ask questions that are likely to reveal the identity of the witness if we are still in open session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objection on the part of the Prosecution?  No.  So the Chamber orders closed session.  And we crave the indulgence of the public.  So the closed session is ordered for the sake of protecting the witness and in the interest of justice. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 8 to 29] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 1 to 7 by Roxane Lane)


















MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are now in open session.

Mr. Prosecutor, you may proceed.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you, Your Honours.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness CBJ, in 1994, during the absence of Father Straton, did anyone assume the authorities of parish priest at Nyange parish?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Who?
A.	It was Father Athanase Seromba.
Q.	In cross-examination, you were asked about the object that you saw Ndungutse hit people with after the tower had fell.  Can you tell us of what material that object was made?
A.	He used a hammer.
Q.	Of what material was that object made?
A.	That hammer was a metal hammer, but it was a hammer that was used for breaking stones.
Q.	Do you know the difference between a hammer and a mallet, or not?
A.	Yes, I know the difference between the two.
Q.	Can you please explain that difference in the context of what you saw Ndungutse using?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Just a minute, Prosecutor.  Could you repeat your question, please?
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Can you explain that difference between a hammer and a mallet within the context of what you saw Ndungutse carrying and using that day?
A.	The difference between the two hammers lies in the fact that the mallet has a wooden handle.  Generally, it is carpenters who use that kind of hammer, whereas the kind of hammer that Ndungutse was using was a metal hammer, but it had a wooden handle.  That is the difference between the two hammers.
Q.	Where was Seromba when you saw Ndungutse doing that?
A.	I was lying amidst the corpses in front of the Nyange church - or, rather, inside the Nyange church.
Q.	Where was Seromba at that time?
A.	At that time Seromba was in the inner courtyard of the presbytery of the parish.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you very much, Your Honours.  Nothing further.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.
Witness, we are have come to the conclusion of your testimony before this Tribunal.  We will like to thank you for having come and for having answered the questions that were put to you.  We wish you a safe return trip to your home.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, too.

Usher out the witness, please.
(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, you may usher in your next witness.  Is it CBN?
MR. TOWNSEND:
Indeed.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Pognon.
MR. POGNON:
Before the witness should be called in, I wish -- with respect to the examination of the witness who has just gone out, I would like formally -- before next witness comes in, I would like to make the following comments, so that, with respect to the next witness, things should be clear.

We realised that the Prosecutor in respect of that witness virtually, to use this term, "put aside" a good portion of the statements that the witness had earlier made; in other words, the witness was questioned beyond what he had stated.  Of all the statements -- of all the four statements, the witness was questioned well beyond those statements.  We heard as -- the Prosecutor, before commencement of the trial that in -- under Rule 73bis he should disclose documents bearing on all the points on which the witnesses will be testifying.  That document was not given to us.  We were only given a summary of the points of the indictment; that is, we were given only summaries of the witness statements, making it clear that summaries were not limiting.

The Rule is that witnesses must testify on what they stated, and the Prosecutor has to look for the circumstances and explanations that will clarify the statements.  The problem that I'm raising for starters, is that not having had the summaries of the points on which witnesses would be testifying, we will be lending ourselves to the slippages that we witnessed with that witness.  I would like, respectfully, to tell the Chamber that if, like with the previous speakers, the Prosecutor goes beyond the statements, I will definitely file an objection.
MR. TOWNSEND:
The Prosecutor submits that we have fulfilled all the disclosure requirements.  All the statements have been disclosed.  There is no Rule that says that the witnesses are limited to what they say in the statement.  They are here to come and tell the full stories, give all the details, the memories are refreshed and expanded.  I think that has been the case.  If counsel wants to make his objection, let him do so during the testimony, rather than make a hypothetical one at this stage.  We are ready to proceed, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We have taken note of what the various parties have stated.  Please, usher in the next witness, CBN.
(Witness entered courtroom)
MR. TOWNSEND:
I am going to begin with a personal identifying sheet.  And the second question is going to relate to photograph exhibit 3-21, P. 3-21; if that could be put on the display, please.  I have about 50 questions, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness giving evidence for the Prosecution.  For purposes of this trial, you will be called Witness CBN.  You will be examined in-chief by the Prosecutor and then cross-examined by the Defence counsel.  We request you to listen to the questions, which will be put to you, carefully, and answer them precisely and concisely.

We will now request you to make a solemn declaration.
(Declaration made by Witness CBN in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you.

Counsel for the Prosecution, please proceed to examination-in-chief of Witness CBN.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you very much, Your Honours.



WITNESS CBN,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Good morning, Witness CBN.  Is that a document before you?
A.	Yes, I can see the document before me.
Q.	Having read that document, can you tell us if it contains your personal particulars and if you have signed it to attest to the accuracy and truthfulness of the information therein?
A.	Yes, I agree that the information stated on this document is truthful.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, this document was disclosed to me yesterday and I was shown it informally.  I would like to see it again.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The document will be shown to you once the witness will have identified that he signed that document.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Was there a response to that question, Your Honours?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I believe the witness has answered the question, unless you have another answer to give.
MR. TOWNSEND:
So that document, having been shown to Defence yesterday and again today and having -- I would move it into evidence as a Prosecutor's exhibit, the next in line, and have it be placed under seal, please, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No objection from Counsel Pognon?  No objection.

Very well.  We thank you.

This document is admitted as a Defence --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
A Prosecution exhibit, Madam President, not Defence exhibit.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution Exhibit.  He is a Prosecution witness.  It will be Exhibit No. P. 16, Prosecution exhibit.
(Exhibit No. P. 16 admitted, under seal)
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you very much, Your Honours.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness CBN, there is a photograph being displayed; Prosecutor's Exhibit P. 3-21.  It's on the screen before you.  What is in that photograph?
A.	It is a photograph of the church.
Q.	Which church?
A.	It is the Nyange church.
Q.	In April 1994 did you go to Nyange church?
A.	Yes.
Q.	On what day did you arrive at Nyange church?
A.	It was on Tuesday, the 12th of April.
Q.	Can you give us an approximate time of day: morning, afternoon, night?
A.	I got there at about 1 a.m., if I reckon it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I would like to point out that this document, P. 16, is placed under seal.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	On what day did you depart or leave Nyange church?
A.	I left the parish on Friday, the 15th April.
Q.	In April 1994 who was the parish priest at Nyange?
A.	It was Seromba.
Q.	What is that person's other name?
A.	Athanase Seromba.
Q.	On the 13th of April, did you see Seromba; yes or no?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did you hear Seromba say anything?
A.	Yes, I heard him say something.
Q.	What did you hear Seromba say that 13th April 1994?
A.	In the morning we asked him to say mass and he told us that he couldn't waste his time saying mass for Tutsi, that our brothers, the Inyenzi, the Tutsi Inyenzi, had attacked the country and they had even killed President Habyarimana.  He further said that the god of the Tutsi no longer existed.
Q.	At which location was Seromba when he said those words?
A.	He was standing in front of the church.
Q.	Did you see any weapons inside the church?
A.	Yes, there were; there were traditional weapons.
Q.	What happened regarding those traditional weapons that you saw?
A.	On the 13th, between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m., police -- communal police officers and soldiers came and told us that we had to hand in those weapons, that we did not need them since we were guarded.  So we gave them our weapons and they took them away.
Q.	Did you recognise any of those individuals who seized those weapons?
A.	Yes, I knew some them.
Q.	Can you tell us the names of those you recognised, please?
A.	I can give the name of Mbakirirehe, former brigadier; a commune police officer called Maharamu; another called Biteme; as well as Rangira.
Q.	Did you see an assistant brigadier?
A.	Yes, I saw him.  His name was Bayisenge.  He was also present.
Q.	Why did the Tutsis --
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Pognon.
MR. POGNON:
I am taking notes.  And these are the sort of questions whose answers are contained in the question itself.  "Did you see a deputy brigadier?"  He should have, rather, asked, "Who did you see?"  The Prosecutor should refrain from asking such questions.
MR. TOWNSEND:
In his initial response he identified communal policemen, assistant brigadiers that fall within that rubric.

May I proceed?
MR. POGNON:
The Tribunal will weigh the evidence.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, please proceed, while paying attention to the questions.
MR. TOWNSEND:
I shall.  Thank you, Your Honours.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Why did the Tutsi in the church give up their traditional weapons?
A.	We followed the instructions that were given to us, and it was obvious that they could not refuse to hand in their weapons.  And we should also bear in mind that they were under guard; they were guarded.
Q.	Did those persons you have named carry anything, with regard to before they went into the church?
A.	Are you referring to the communal police officers and the soldiers?  Yes, they were armed with their guns.
Q.	Where were you at that time?
A.	When they came in, I was in front of the door.  When they came into the church, I also went inside the church, but when they came out of church, I, myself, also went out.
Q.	Where did they go with the weapons that they had seized?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could counsel repeat the question because the interpreters didn't hear it?

"They passed on the road leading to the statue."
MR. TOWNSEND:
The question was where did they take those seized weapons.
MR. POGNON:
He has answered question.  He answered the question.
MR. TOWNSEND:
The interpretation booth asked me to repeat, Counsel.  I wasn't reposing it.  I'm moving on to the next question.
MR. POGNON:
I heard the answer.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Counsel for the Prosecution.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you, Your Honours.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	I would like you to turn your attention to Thursday, the 14th of April.  On that day, did you see Seromba; yes or no?
A.	Yes, I saw him.
Q.	Did you hear him say anything on the 14th of April?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Please tell us what you heard Seromba say.
A.	On that same day we asked him to say mass.  He also refused.  We told him that the children were beginning to pee and even to pass a stool, and he said the children could even do that on the altar, and he forbade us to return to the banana plantation, saying that if ever we returned there, the gendarmes -- or, rather, the soldiers -- he said that if any of the refugees returned to the banana plantation, they should be shot at and that the forces had come to protect the refugees as well as his banana plantation.
Q.	Where did you hear Seromba say those words?
A.	He was standing in front of the church.
Q.	Can you explain to whom Seromba was speaking when he said those words related to the bananas?
A.	He was speaking to us.
Q.	Can you estimate the distance in metres that separated you from Seromba when he said those words, or pick an object in the room to show that distance?
A.	I was standing on the balcony and he was standing in the courtyard in front of me.  I did not use a tape to measure the distance.  What I would say is only an estimate.  I believe he was standing at a distance of about five metres from me.
Q.	I'm not sure I understood, from the interpretation, where you were standing.  Can you explain in other words where you were standing at that time?
MR. POGNON:
He answered the question, Madam President.  He answered the question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I heard "balcony".  I was going to ask the question myself.  I would like the witness to clarify which balcony is he referring to.

Mr. Witness, could you explain exactly what you are referring to?
THE WITNESS:
I was standing in front of the door and on the verandah.  That is in front of the door of the church; that was outside on the verandah.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	What was under your feet, concrete or dirt, or can you just explain?
A.	It was near the cemented area.  It was a beaten earth courtyard, but it was near the verandah.
Q.	Can you tell us the word in Kinyarwanda, just the verb that's been interpreted to us as "pass stool" or defecate, and if the interpreter could also give it to us in Kinyarwanda, what you understood Seromba to say?
A.	He said that the children could stool even further on, near the altar, that the children could shit anywhere, further from the altar.
Q.	The expression that he used, in your understanding, was that a polite way to express that activity?
A.	No, he was not polite.  In any case, when he was saying those words, he was not happy.
Q.	Did you see any authorities present at Nyange parish on the 14th of April 1994?
A.	Yes, I saw them.
Q.	Where?
A.	I saw them come to the church and Father Seromba welcomed them.  They went into the inner courtyard of the presbytery and then they went upstairs in the presbytery building.
Q.	Did you see them on the upstairs portion of the presbytery building, yourself?
A.	I saw them.
Q.	Besides Seromba, who did you see?
A.	There was the bourgmestre, Ndahimana; Kanyarukiga; and judicial police inspector, Kayishema --
Q.	What's the first name of --
A.	-- but I was not able to identify the others.
Q.	What's the other name of Kanyarukiga, if you know it?
A.	I do not remember.
Q.	What was the occupation or job of Kanyarukiga?
A.	He had a pharmacy at the centre, very close to the statue.
Q.	When you saw them upstairs in the presbytery, where were you?
A.	I was near the church, against the wall, facing the inner courtyard.  That is where I was standing.
Q.	If I'm looking at the front of the church, can you give us an orientation of where you were?
A.	If I took the front of the door, I was -- of the church, I was standing to the right.
Q.	Can you tell us at what time of day, approximately, you saw those authorities at the parish?
A.	It was in the afternoon.
Q.	Did you see Seromba and the other authorities you've named do anything while on the first -- on the upper level of the presbytery?
A.	What I saw was that they were sitting and looking on and Bourgmestre Ndahimana was pointing in the direction at which we were, but I do not know what they were discussing.
Q.	When you say "in which we were", who do you mean when you say "we"?
A.	I am referring to the refugees who were with me.
Q.	After you saw those authorities gathered, did you see anything else happen?
A.	What happened next was they came down.  They passed in front of us in the courtyard and they went up to Bourgmestre Ndahimana.  We went and told the bourgmestre the problems we were experiencing, that we were being attacked and we were waiting for a solution to our problems.  And he said, "Leave those attacking you alone because your brothers, the Inyenzi, will attack the country and they will arrive after you are dead."
Q.	Who said those words you have just pronounced?
A.	They were said by Bourgmestre Ndahimana.
Q.	Where was Seromba when Ndahimana said that?
A.	They were together.
Q.	I'd like to turn your attention to the 15th April 1994, and if you could tell us, step by step, what happened that day.

I will repeat my question: turning your attention to the 15th April, can you tell us, step by step, what you saw happen that day?
A.	Yes, I can tell you.  In the morning we faced the attacks that were launched against us until we were beaten following the grenades that were thrown by the assailants at us, up until the time when I, myself, fled; that was in the afternoon.  In the meantime this is what I saw: on the upper floor of the building, Father Seromba sought refuge there, but he did not come down.
Q.	Before the grenades were used, what weapons or items were used in this attack?
A.	The assailants were throwing stones at us and we did the same, and at one time they threw grenades at us.  The assailants had traditional weapons, spears and others.
Q.	Was anyone affected by the grenades?
A.	Some people were affected by the grenades.  I was standing near a tree in the rear courtyard of the presbytery.  Girls were wounded.  I was throwing stones while taking cover behind a eucalyptus tree.
Q.	Was anyone killed?
A.	Those people moved towards the church.  I don't know whether they died, but they seemed to have died.
Q.	Who was in the church during this attack?
A.	I haven't quite understood your question, Prosecutor.
Q.	Was anyone inside the church at the time of the attack?
A.	There were people inside the church.  Some people were inside the church while others were defending themselves outside.
Q.	Did the attackers ever come inside the church?
A.	The assailants were around the church.  They came into the courtyard when we were repelled.  They came in a vehicle and they would hit us with sharp objects.  That was when I fled.
Q.	You mentioned seeing Seromba.  Can you tell us what you saw him doing, if anything?
A.	He did nothing.  He was upstairs moving about.
Q.	When you say "upstairs", can you specify which building and location?
A.	It was the upper floor of a building that was behind their office.
Q.	Did Seromba carry anything at that time?
A.	He was carrying a gun.
Q.	Can you explain what type of gun?
A.	I don't know the type of gun he was carrying.  We were not used to seeing people carrying guns.  It was only during that period that we saw guns.
Q.	Would you characterise this as a small or a long gun?
A.	It was a long gun.  It wasn't a short gun.
Q.	Where on Seromba's person did you see this gun, long gun?
A.	From the time when I arrived I could see soldiers carrying guns, but usually I saw police officers carrying those guns.
Q.	Seromba himself, you said, had a long gun.  Can you explain how he carried it, where on his person he carried it?
A.	He was carrying that gun slung across his shoulder.
Q.	Can you estimate the number of Tutsi refugees gathered there on the 15th of April?
A.	If I were to make an estimate, since the church was full and the courtyard was full, I could estimate the number at 2,000.
Q.	Can you estimate the number of assailants you saw on the 15th of April?
A.	I cannot give you an estimate of their number because on all sides there were many people, and the Nyange hill which was facing the church was full of people.  And in all directions people were coming.  There were too many of them.  I cannot estimate their number.  They were very many.
Q.	Were there more refugees or more attackers, would you estimate, on that day of 15 April?
A.	There were more assailants.  The assailants were ten times more than the refugees.  There were many of them.  They were many.
Q.	Who comprised the attackers?
A.	They were Hutu.
Q.	Can you estimate the time of day you ran away from Nyange church on 15 April?
A.	I fled in the afternoon at about 1 p.m.
Q.	At the time you fled, had you seen a bulldozer present at Nyange church; yes or no?
MR. POGNON:
Objection.  Objection, Madam President.  The question he asked was leading.  He should have asked what he saw while he was fleeing and if -- rather, than ask whether he saw a bulldozer, because I think that was a leading question.
MR. TOWNSEND:
As a yes and no question, it could be answered either way and my question does not suggest that you should answer either affirmatively or negatively, and I think it will assist the Chamber in placing the sequence of events.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, can you answer the question, please?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can answer that question, because when I left, there was no bulldozer.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Can you describe the power or authority or stature held by Seromba in the community of Nyange, if any, in your view?
MR. POGNON:
Objection, Madam President.  Objection.  I don't see how a witness can be asked to describe the power of somebody.  I really don't see how, unless he is being asked to say something, or he is being led to say something.

MR. TOWNSEND:
If I could just add, Your Honour, as a member of a community, he is in a position to answer this question.  The Defence have asked similar questions in cross-examination.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you rephrase your question?
MR. TOWNSEND:
It would be my pleasure, Your Honours.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Can you describe the position or stature of Seromba in the community of Nyange, if any, in your view?
A.	Seromba was a respected person, and even the civilian authorities had lots of respect for him and, usually, we respect the priests, and the authorities did the same because they worked together.
Q.	Without saying any names, did anyone close to you die at Nyange church?
A.	Yes, many.  My family members died in Nyange.  Members of my family died at Nyange.  I do not know if I can characterise them or to say which members of my family are in question or say exactly what was the relationship between them and myself.
Q.	Can you just say a number, at this time, of the close family members that you lost?  You can estimate.
A.	My four sisters died at Nyange.  My junior brother also; that makes five.  If you add my father, that makes six.  My father's wife also died; that is seven.  My wife, herself; that makes eight.  Her daughter and the children of my sister.  That makes 11 people.  There are others who were not in my direct family; that is, the members of my father's family totalled 11.
Q.	In what year did you meet Seromba?
A.	Do you mean when I saw him?  I saw him in 1994 because we didn't share anything in common before.  I saw him in 1994.
Q.	Before the 15th April, are you able to estimate how many times you would have seen Seromba?
A.	I can make an estimate.  But I could say that I didn't see him more than seven times.
Q.	Might you recognise Seromba if you were to see him today?
A.	I may be able to identify him or not.  Much time has elapsed.  I couldn't observe him well.
Q.	Witness CBN, I'd like you to please stand up where you are, look around the courtroom, all over, and tell us if you recognise anyone in the courtroom that you've identified as Seromba during your testimony.  If you wish to move about, address the Judges.  You may stand, if you wish.
A.	I will request for leave to stand up.  I think I will more easily look around.  It would appear to me that it is that person behind there.  I see a man who looks like him, behind there.
Q.	Can you please point -- or describe where he is seated, or wearing?
A.	I can see that he is wearing a shirt that has a small thing here where I am pointing at, and it would look like that person is Seromba.
Q.	Can you tell us in which numbered seat that person is?

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter is continuing; that is the Kinyarwanda interpreter.
THE WITNESS:
He has an under-wear that looks like the one that I, myself, am wearing.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can he tell us in which row is he seeing that person?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can tell you that.  He is behind that person who is where I am pointing to.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness CBN, can you try to tell us what numbered seat, first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and in which row, if possible?
A.	He is in the back row.  I don't see any other row.  He is near this man I'm pointing to with my finger.  He is sitting near that man.
MR. TOWNSEND:
I'd ask the curtains to be drawn to allow the witness to get a little closer because from his pointing, that is not clear to me; if that's okay with the Chamber and the witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very good.  Please draw the curtains.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness CBN, they are drawing the curtains so you will be able to walk around the courtroom freely.  I invite you to look all around, and take your time, and tell us if you recognise anyone, yes or no.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Could the microphone be turned on closer to the witness?  The witness doesn't have his headset.
THE WITNESS:
I see that it is this man I'm showing here.  I see that he resembles Seromba.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you very much, Witness.  You can return to the stand.

At this time I have to offer for the record that the witness has not identified the Accused.  And I have no further questions.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.

Indeed, the witness hasn't been able to identify the Accused.

Counsel Pognon, are you the one who will be doing the cross-examination of the witness?  Then you have the floor, Counsel.
MR. POGNON:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, Your Honours, I am going to proceed with the cross-examination of CBN.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Witness, good afternoon.  Witness, good afternoon.  Probably he did not receive the interpretation of my greetings.
A.	Yes, you have greeted me, and I'm saying good afternoon.
Q.	Yes, of course, I greeted you.  The Prosecutor has just questioned you.  I will also, in turn, put some questions to you.

Witness -- I cannot hear him.  Witness, how many times have people come to interview you after the events of Nyange?
A.	I cannot recall the number of times.
Q.	That's possible.  It has been a long time.  If I were to remind you of the number of times, would you remember?  If I were to give you the various dates on which you have been interviewed, would that ring a bell, would that mean something to you?
A.	That would not serve any purpose for me.  You took down notes relating to all the statements.  I didn't take any notes.
Q.	Were you interviewed on the 15th of November 1995?
A.	I do not recall the dates.  All I know is that I met certain persons to whom I gave statements and that they kept records thereof.
Q.	If I were to give you a date, like the date of 17th August 2000, would that remind you of something concerning those people who came to interview you?
A.	In fact, I cannot recall dates because I did not keep a record of them somewhere, and people came at different times; I, therefore, cannot recall the dates on which the various persons came.
Q.	Then I will take your statement, your first statement, when people came to see you, I think for the first time, on the 15th of November 1995, and they put questions to you.  Now, they asked you if the events -- and I'm referring to the transcripts of 15th November 1995.  They asked you whether the events of April 1994 -- namely, the genocide, the massacres -- had been foreseeable.  Do you recall whether they asked you that question?  And these are the transcripts of 15th November 1995, referenced on page K0023012, in manuscript, 1994.  Do you recall that they asked you that question?
A.	Can you repeat your question?
Q.	So, the first time that the people came to see you, they asked you whether, in your opinion, the massacres that occurred -- that took place in Kivumu could have been foreseeable.  Do you remember that they asked you that question?  Could the massacres have been predicted?
A.	I do not recall.
Q.	Do you remember having answered them that, in that commune, the Hutu had been sensitised since the attack by the Inkotanyi three years before and that the communal authorities kept insisting that the attackers were Tutsi and that they should be eliminated?  Do you remember having given that answer?
A.	Yes, I remember that answer that I gave.
Q.	But you don't remember the question that I asked you a short while ago.  Do you recall that you stated that, soon after the president's death, a certain Thomas was killed?
A.	Yes, I made that statement.
Q.	Do you recall that at Thomas's burial, you heard the communal conseiller, Callixte, who was leading the Kigali secteur, state that things should be done quickly because there was a meeting that was going to be held?
A.	No, I did not make that statement.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you very much.  Thank you, Your Honours, counsel is citing from a 1995 statement which was read back on a subsequent date to the witness, and corrections on that very sentence were made by this witness.  So, in all fairness, I think counsel shouldn't be citing from the '95 one, but rather the most recent and as modified on that same point.  Am I making myself clear?  He has retracted that, in effect.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I would like to express a wish that -- well, so far we have been proceeding in that manner, and I should like to express a wish that the Prosecutor should let me do my job because what he has just said was indeed -- was more like telling me what to do in my cross-examination.  I would like to ask him to let me proceed the way I wish to.  These are statements that were disclosed to us and this is clear.  It is clear that I am using this statement.  It is not his examination-in-chief that will stop us from questioning the witness on the statements that he has made.  We have always proceeded in this manner.  This is a new method of operating now.
MR. TOWNSEND:
If I can clarify, Your Honours.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I would not like that the clarifications that I brought should contribute to, once again, telling -- guiding the witness as a -- as it has been the habit so far.  That is what we are insisting with the Prosecutor.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, you said the witness had made some corrections.  You are the one who had these disclosures (sic).  Did you disclose them to the Defence?  You are the one who had the statements.  Did you disclose them to the Defence?
MR. TOWNSEND:
Absolutely, Your Honour, and that's why it is not fair to the witness to read back from the first version when the witness has subsequently retracted that.  And there is the original K-number that appears on the document.  The new K-number is K0259036, and the sentence that counsel is citing is struck out and there's an explanation provided.  So he is seeking to impeach with something that has already been taken back and clarified.  It's just not fair.  That's my objection.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I don't quite see what the Prosecutor is trying to say.  I have the statement here which -- from which I am reading.  I don't understand why he wants to disrupt my work.  I have the statement here which was disclosed to us.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Apparently, there is a document in English and which enters corrections.  But we are going to request the -- we are going to ask the Prosecutor to tell us at what point in time this document was disclosed to the Defence.  Apparently, the document is in English.
MR. TOWNSEND:
I'll need just a moment, Your Honour.

This document was disclosed on 9th of August 2004, as it appears on the cover page.  The registry page in the package is numbered 1958, and the K-number is K0259036.  That's the English, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That is indeed what we were saying.  So that is the English version, and it is possible that Counsel Pognon couldn't read that document which is in English and that hasn't been translated into French.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can Counsel Pognon start his questions -- start talking all over because he hadn't put on his microphone?
MR. POGNON:
The document we are referring to is the document from the Prosecution, and this document as we have seen in -- with the previous examination, we have seen that there is a portion thereof that is in manuscript and which, by the way, doesn't have a cover page.

Now, to find the cover page we -- I had to refer to the English translation of that document which is here appended, and at that point I saw the cover page with the identification particulars of the witness.  So it is that document that is the French version that I have, and what I have in my hands -- the English version that I have is a version which virtually says the same thing, and I do not see what the Prosecutor is trying to say when he submits that that document had been modified.  On the contrary, Madam President, I see --
MR. TOWNSEND:
There is nothing to be translated about big black Xs to be put through each of the words of the sentence.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Pognon, have you found the document in question?  It's the document in English.
MR. POGNON:
I have found a document in English.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
There are corrections on that said document with the initials of the witness.
MR. POGNON:
I have seen that document, Madam President, but this document which is here and which was disclosed with many things struck off -- I have with me here a document that -- with nothing that has been stricken from it and, here, nothing tells me that these are corrections.  So I have this document that is here and I have another that has no cancellations, which I am trying to read which is in English and which is in manuscript.  I, therefore, did not receive the document in which everything has been stricken.  The English version is there, and even before that English version, there was another English version that had no cancellations and which is still there.
MR. TOWNSEND:
To each --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, did you want to take the floor?

Very good, Counsel Pognon.  For this to be useful, can you use the document on which you have corrections made by the witness?  This will help us gain time.  Could you examine him on -- because if you examine him on the basis of the other document, I think we may be told subsequently that there were corrections.  So we would like to point that out to you.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, very respectfully, the document that has been given here, it's -- I am referring to the last page of this document.  Here, there were two translations into English.  There is the initial translation which is K00230022 which has no cancellation -- which bears no cancellations.  And we find ourselves with a document, that is, K0023 (sic) has been cancelled and now we have K0025909026 (sic), and this is the document that I am being expected to use and I have to follow the English version thereof and it is not legible to me and, alas, Madam President, I have another version that is legible.  I really don't quite see where in it it said that this is the one that should be used.

The Prosecutor disclosed three documents to us and they cannot start standing in the way of my cross-examination.  In any case, the witness has already acknowledged a certain number of things.  Why is the Prosecutor interrupting me -- or stopping me?  Unless -- I should be given a legible translation or we hand this over to the interpreters and they start translating the document for us; otherwise, I don't have any document with me, in which case you haven't disclosed any documents to me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I would like to make a proposal.  If you intend to cross-examine the witness, relying on the document that you have with you, but which hasn't been corrected, you can do that.  As far as the Chamber is concerned, the Chamber will determine what value to attribute to what would have been said in respect to those documents.  So you may proceed.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, under these circumstances --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Excuse me; there was an urgent motion.

We invite Counsel Pognon to proceed with his cross-examination.
MR. POGNON:
Regarding what you have just said, I would suggest this -- because it completely disrupts my cross-examination plan.  I would suggest that this document be translated.  It will, therefore, be resubmitted for translation but, with your leave, I will continue cross-examining the witness on the basis of the French document I have before me since my understanding of English is not of the level of that of the Prosecutor.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Witness, do you admit to having stated that you heard that the communal conseiller held a meeting?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness's microphone is not on, it would appear.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I admit to having stated that I heard people make that statement.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	I believe you have just admitted that grenades were distributed to Hutu villagers who were initially armed only with machetes and masks and that weapons were given to political leaders.
A.	What I acknowledge is that weapons, mainly grenades, were given to assailants.  Regarding the distribution of weapons to political leaders, I pointed out to you that the assailants also included political leaders.  And I would say that those weapons were given to them at the time when it was evident that we could resist them, and that was when they assembled near Codekoki and said something to one another.  I don't know the subject of their conversation, but I know that that was when it was decided that weapons be given to them.
Q.	If you didn't know what they told themselves when they met, according to you at a place called Codekoki, how can you assert, therefore, that that was when it was decided that weapons be given to them?
A.	The proof is that, prior to that, we resisted up to the time when they had to throw grenades at us, grenades which did not explode and, subsequently, they assembled.  When they returned, they threw grenades and this time around the grenades exploded.  So we told ourselves they had been told how to throw those grenades correctly.  That is what makes me say so.
Q.	Who, in your opinion, distributed those weapons, supposedly?
A.	According to me, I believe those weapons were distributed by policemen and soldiers, because at that time the inhabitants did not have those weapons at their disposal.  Only the soldiers and police officers had them.
Q.	Which police officers and soldiers?  Are you just imagining that that was just what was done, or you are asserting that specific police officers, specific soldiers, distributed those weapons?
A.	What makes me say that is that when we repelled the assailants, they went close to Codekoki and we could see that those assailants spoke with the police officers and the soldiers.  When the soldiers returned to intensify the attacks -- and we are talking of the soldiers and police officers -- I could distinguish between police and soldiers by looking at their uniforms.
Q.	Does it mean, therefore, that you are asserting that you are not in a position to point a finger at particular police officers -- a particular police officer or soldier as the people who allegedly gave those arms, those weapons?  Is that what you mean?
A.	No.  I have no specific name in mind.  The people who distributed the weapons fall under the category that I mentioned.  They were the people who had the weapons in their possession.  I believe, those were the people who distributed weapons to the assailants.
Q.	Thank you.  On what day did you go to the parish?
A.	Tuesday.
Q.	What date?
A.	On the 12th.
Q.	What specific event made you leave your house to seek refuge at the parish?
A.	What prompted me to go there was that in the morning an attack has been launched against the house of Safari.  His wife's hand had been cut off, and his savings booklet was seized.  At that time a roadblock was set up.  The inhabitants were not aware of what was happening; they came to his help (sic) and someone who had erected a roadblock in the area noticed that people were coming to help Judith.

When those people went to Kabuga, they returned and looted property.  At one point they started looting in Rukuro and Gisenyi, and then we started looking for a hideout.
MR. POGNON:
While taking precautions to protect the witness, could we give him a piece of paper so that he could write down the name of the cellule where those events occurred.  If, Madam President, would allow me so that we shouldn't have to go into closed session.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Registrar, give him a piece of paper.
MR. TOWNSEND:
I am very sorry to interrupt.  I have to excuse myself and the Prosecutor be represented from hereon by Mr. Moses.  I am returning to Kosovo.  I wish everyone the best and I thank everyone so far. Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  You may proceed.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	What is the distance between that area which you are describing to the parish?
A.	It is very close; between the two locations there is a cellule.
Q.	Roughly, what distance?  What is the distance, roughly?
A.	When I leave my house, it takes me about 30 minutes to get to the parish.  In fact, you have to go downhill which facilitates the journey, but the return journey takes about more than 30 minutes.
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  When did you leave your home?
A.	I left my house at about midnight.  I would say about that hour, but I did not have an -- a watch, so what I'm giving is only an estimate.
Q.	You left at what time; midnight?
A.	I would say between midnight and 12.30 a.m.  This is only an estimate because I believe I got to the church at about 1 a.m.
Q.	When you got to the church, for purposes of clarity in the questions -- I can make the distinction between the church -- that is where the mass is said; in the building in which mass is said, the offices where people go to see the priests, when they want to ask something of him; and then the storey-building which is behind the offices which is where the priests live.  Do you agree with the distinction I have made?
A.	Yes, Counsel.
Q.	From there, on the basis of this, when you left your house, where did you arrive; in front of the church, the building where the mass is said?
A.	I went inside the church.
Q.	Yes; you went inside the church.
A.	The following day I came out of the church.
Q.	Witness, let us take one step at a time, as the Prosecutor would say.  You arrived at about 1 a.m. and you went directly to the church.  Do you mean that you went directly into the church on arriving from your house, that is, into the building where mass is said?
A.	Yes, that is what I said.
Q.	There was nobody outside?
A.	No, I didn't find anybody outside.  I found refugees inside the church.  Even the soldiers who were there did not see me.
Q.	Right.  And once you got into the church, who did you immediately recognise as a person you were used to seeing?
A.	As regards that night, I recognised nobody.
Q.	Was there a blackout in the church?
A.	There were no lamps; there were no lights.
Q.	That notwithstanding, were you not able to assess the number of people inside the church on that night of the 12th?
A.	It was not bright inside the church.  There were no lights inside the church.  I could observe that there was a crowd of people inside, but I am not in a position to give you the number, only estimates.
Q.	But do you remember whether, after your arrival, other people arrived that night to that church?
A.	Yes, people continued arriving in droves the -- up to the following day.  Some people were transported from the hills.  They came in a vehicle belonging to a person called Rwamsirabo.  That's the person I saw arrive that night.
Q.	The following day did you see people arrive?
A.	I did not see any.  It was dark.  I did not see any.
Q.	You stated that on the 13th, the church was attacked.  Do you stand by that statement?
A.	No, on the Wednesday there were no attacks.  The people who came to attack us came from a roadblock situated near the statue.  I was not aware of who led that attack.
Q.	That Wednesday was the 13th.  You said that there were no attacks and you said further that you didn't know who the person who led the attack was.  Was there an attack or wasn't there an attack?
A.	Counsel, understand what I'm saying correctly.  The people who attacked came from a roadblock situated near the statue, but I don't know who the leader of the assailants was at the time.
Q.	I'm not asking you who the leader was.  All I'm asking you is whether or not there was an attack.
A.	There was an attack.
Q.	Regarding that attack, do you remember having said that you saw persons -- the persons, including Bazimaziki, the PSD official; Mr. Balisaba, official of the radical wing of MDR; Mr. Ndungutse, an official of the MRND -- who told you to fight the Inyenzi?
A.	No, those people came during the attacks that were launched on the 14th.
Q.	Right.  On Wednesday, the 13th, where were you when people came from near the roadblock, that is, near the statue, came to attack you?
A.	I was in the churchyard.
Q.	You mean in front of the entrance to the church?
A.	Yes.
Q.	At that time, how many of you were there?  Could you give a rough estimate of the number of people who were there -- the number of you who were there that Wednesday?
A.	If I were to make an estimate, I think that in the morning there were more than a thousand of us.  There was a large number of people.  People had come in large numbers.  I recall that vehicles dropped other people in the church at about 10 a.m.  I think our numbers had increased and that that same Wednesday other people came to the church at about 10 a.m.
Q.	At what time did that attack take place?
A.	The attack started at about 8 a.m., between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m.  As a matter of fact, they came, they attacked us and they returned to the roadblock.  When they attacked us, we repelled them and they returned to the roadblock.
Q.	And that attack lasted up to when?
A.	The next day, on Thursday, the attackers increased in number, whereas on Friday --
Q.	Please, let's talk about Wednesday.  The attack of Wednesday which began which between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m., how long did that attack last; for how long did the attack last?  When did you have a break?
MR. POGNON:
I did not hear the translation.
THE WITNESS:
We had a respite during the night because during the night they didn't attack us.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	So throughout the day they would attack you; you would push them back; and they would come back, et cetera.  Is that how things would happen?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	On that Wednesday, when did you see Father Seromba?
A.	In the morning.
Q.	At what time?
A.	At about 8 a.m., but that is only an estimated time, but I do recall that it was in the morning.
Q.	So, you saw him just before the attack?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Good.  Where did you see him?
A.	He was in front of the church.
Q.	Where precisely in front of the church?  You were shown the church.  Where precisely in front of the church?
A.	He was right in front of the door, coming from the rear courtyard of the presbytery.  It was in front of the door of the backyard of the presbytery that was in front of their office.  So it was in front of the office.  That is where the pedestrians used to pass.
Q.	Did you see him alone or did you see him with other persons?
A.	He was alone.
Q.	And you, were you alone?
A.	There were very many of us in the outer courtyard.
Q.	And when you saw him, what did you do?
A.	We asked him to celebrate mass for us.  I do not know if you want me to continue to tell you what he said as an answer.
Q.	How many of you made that request to him?
A.	There were very many of us.  Each of us was asking him to say mass for us.
Q.	Do you remember the people who were asking him to say mass?  Were you asking him to say mass in turns, or did the entire group make the request at the same time?
A.	There were people who could approach him, people like Bonera, a certain Rutegesha, and another person call Rakariyu.  Those were teachers, and they and the priest were acquainted to each other.  They were the ones who would go for a walk and talk to him.  We -- also, we were asking for that mass to be said.
Q.	And when you asked for him to say the mass, what was his answer?
A.	He replied to us that he didn't have time to waste in celebrating mass for the Tutsi because our brothers, the Tutsi, had attacked the country and had killed President Habyarimana, and that the god of the Tutsi was -- no longer existed.
Q.	So he said all of that?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Do you recall that you stated -- and I have your statement -- and I have your statement with me, your statement of 17th August 2000, K025 --there are two Ks, one is struck off; 0258246 -- or, rather, 9046.  You stated the following: "In the morning of the following day" --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We are still looking for the page, Counsel.
MR. POGNON:
-- 17th February 2000.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We are ready, Counsel.

Counsel hasn't put on his microphone.  Can he be requested to do so?  Can counsel begin his question all over?  He did not put on his microphone when he started.
MR. POGNON:
I haven't even asked the question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you follow, Counsel?
MR. POGNON:
"The next day in the morning, I was outside the church.  I saw Father Seromba move towards a meeting room situated behind the church."
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Do you recall having said that?
A.	Yes, when he made that statement he was moving towards that location.  And a few minutes later, he went up again, and that is just below the church.
Q.	Do you remember that you have just said that you saw him in front of the church, in front of the offices?
A.	Yes.
Q.	If you saw him in front of the church, how could you say that you saw him move towards a meeting room situated behind the church?
A.	He stopped for a short while and we talked to him and he continued on his way towards that room, and later he went up.
Q.	When you saw him in front of the church, was it at that point that you asked him to say mass for you?
A.	Yes, he had just got to the front of the door leading to the backyard.  He had just finished going down the steps, and that is when we talked to him and asked him to say mass for us.
Q.	I think there is yet some confusion there.  You have just said it was in front of the church.  You were shown the front view of the church.  You said that is where you saw him, isn't it?
A.	That is where he was, but he didn't just stay there; he moved on, and he got to where he was going and he came back subsequently.
Q.	Do you recall having said the following: "a request was made to him by the delegation led by a certain Bonera, Aloys, who was accompanied by Rwakayiro, Joseph -- Rutegesha, for him to say mass for us.  Father Seromba answered, aloud, 'No mass for the Inyenzi'".  Do you recall having made that statement?
A.	Rather, he talked of Tutsi.
Q.	So when what I have just read was written, in order to give concrete expression to what you said, you -- they didn't write down exactly what you said; is that correct?
A.	At that point -- at that time the Tutsi were referred to as Inyenzi.  Whether you write "Inyenzi" or "Tutsi", it boils down to the same thing.
Q.	I read your statement to you, namely, he said, "No mass for the Inyenzi".
A.	Rather, the word he pronounced was the word "Tutsi", for Bonera and Rutegesha were the ones who were ahead and were acquainted with him.  So it was in front of them that he made that statement.
Q.	Good.  Does this mean that those words are the words he said to Bonera and Rwakayiro?
A.	He was talking to all of us who were there on the spot.  He was talking aloud for each and every one of us to hear.
Q.	Under those circumstances, in saying what is written here, that you said that he said, "No mass for the Inyenzi", it was, rather, no mass for the Tutsi, that he said, but they wrote "Inyenzi"?
A.	Yes, that is what I meant to say.
Q.	Good.  "No mass for the Inyenzi" - "for the Tutsi", that is what he said.  He was speaking aloud, isn't it?
A.	Yes, he was speaking aloud.
Q.	And these are not words that were reported to you; these are words that you, yourself, heard as he was speaking; is that correct?
A.	Yes.  Those are the words I heard, and probably other people who were with me heard the words, but -- heard his own words, but those are the words that I heard.
Q.	With respect to those words, it is possible that all that was said to have been said by Father Seromba -- he didn't say that the Inkotanyi attacked the country, and all that you said was not written down here.  Where -- from where did you get that?
A.	If there are statements that are not written down in that statement, it would mean that those statements do not come from me.
Q.	This means that the statement that I have here that I read to you, on page K0259046, were attributed to you; is that correct?
A.	Do you want me to repeat all the things that I stated on that day?  I have allowed to you that there are statements that I made.  There is a statement that I -- there's a statement that I gave, but there are some other things that I did not say.  I said that he stated that it is our brothers, the Inyenzi, who had attacked the country and killed President Habyarimana.  That is what I told you.
Q.	To use this wording, couldn't it have been someone else who might have said that the Inyenzi had killed the president?
A.	Who else could have made that statement?  Do you see the name of the person who might have said those words so that you can give me the name?  Since the Tutsi who were -- who were attacking were referred to as Inyenzi and when they attacked, it was said that the Inyenzi had attacked.  Maybe you should ask me what is the difference between Inkotanyi, Inyenzi and Tutsi.  All those three terms refer to the same thing.  The Tutsi were called Inyenzi, and the Inyenzi were called Inyenzi-Inkotanyi.  The three terms had the same reference.
Q.	Mr. Witness, we are relating here what you are supposed to have stated.  I am reading your statement which encapsulates your statements which contain what you are supposed to have stated.  I realise that when the refugees apparently asked Father Seromba to say mass for them, the only answer that was written down as words having been pronounced by Father Seromba was "No mass for the Inyenzi".  In your statement -- just a minute -- no mass for the Tutsi, although  it is written "Inyenzi" here; so no mass for the Tutsi.  The only thing that -- supposed to have said, is that you have added other things which we cannot find in the statement that you made and which you signed.  Do you mean that what you said was not written down in exact terms?
A.	I maintain the answer that I gave you before.
Q.	To the effect that this statement is not yours; that what is said here, it doesn't come from you?
A.	I am speaking Kinyarwanda.  As for the contents, I cannot know the entire contents of that document.  Probably, the interpreter who was present could repeat to me what -- all that I said in Kinyarwanda because I only understand Kinyarwanda.
Q.	Thank you.  On what day did you ask Father Seromba to find a place for children so they could relieve themselves there?
A.	That was on the 14th of April.
Q.	Where was that; where were you?
A.	We were outside; that means in the courtyard in front of the church.
Q.	On that 14th, were there already assailants?
A.	They were outside the parish; they are outside the parish.
Q.	At what distance were they from you?
A.	I was seeing them.  They were opposite me at the Kuishusho centre near the statue.  Others were on the side of Rugabano.
Q.	So, was that opposite you, Rugabano; is it behind?  Is it towards the banana plantation?
A.	Yes, it is near the banana plantation.  It is below the church.
Q.	They were at what distance --
A.	Just a minute.
Q.	-- below the church.  At what distance were they below the church?
A.	I cannot give you an estimate.  There is a small path that passes near the courtyard which we called the jubilee courtyard.  It, therefore, would be difficult for me to give you an estimate.  It is just at the border of the road which is below the church.
Q.	You were in the courtyard of the church on that Thursday, the 14th.  The assailants were opposite, towards the statue on the one side; and on the other side, they were behind.  I wanted to ask you the question.  I'm trying to situate and ask you the question.  You have just said that you were in front of the church.  You had the assailants opposite you towards the statue and you also had assailants below behind the church at Rugabano; that is, after the banana plantation.  You were there in the middle, outside.  Being outside, at which place -- at which place did the -- did you want the father to get for you for children to go and ease themselves there?  I mean, which is of -- which was the location you thought the father could have given you?
A.	The rear courtyard was big, and then there were houses.  We were asking that the children be led to the rear courtyard between the offices and the presbytery so that they could go to toilet, to the latrines, instead of dirtying the place where they were.
Q.	As you said, on that Thursday, there must have been more than 1,000 of you; is that correct?  Since on Wednesday there were about 1,000 of you and you had a few attacks, on Thursday there must have been more than a thousand of you; is that correct?
A.	Try to understand me well.  I have said that on Wednesday in the morning, vehicles brought other refugees.  What this means is that on Thursday, no other refugee came to the church.
MR. POGNON:
I am being told that it is time, so I will have to stop here.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  We are compelled to stop here now.  We may sit next week in the morning and in the afternoon in this courtroom to follow the cross-examination of the witness on Monday.

We have received an urgent motion, an urgent order -- an urgent motion of the Prosecutor.  Apparently we are tired -- I meant a motion and not an order; we are the ones who issue orders on the subject -- and this concerns detained witnesses.  We had rendered an order setting the deadline for one month.  Unfortunately, we have not yet finished with the detained witnesses, so we have to extend that deadline.  The only thing is that, Mr. Prosecutor, you had requested up until the 13th of December.  We were wondering if it was necessary to keep them here until the 13th of December.  Couldn't we hear them as a matter of priority and finish with them next week, which would enable us to extend the deadline to a date that is not too far?
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honours.  Your Honours, we have in Arusha non-detainees and detainees.  The non-detainees are people who have taken time off work and travelled from Rwanda to Arusha.  It would be our intention, Your Honours, to give priority to those people who have taken leave from their jobs to have their evidence heard and given priority, and they -- as the detainees are, if I can put it, not in such a rush to return to Rwanda.  And so, it would be the Prosecution's proposal, Your Honours, that, in fact, next week we give priority to those who have got jobs, have taken time off work to travel here.

That, I think, after this witness who falls into this category, would leave two witnesses, CBK, and CBY.  Those are both people who have taken time off work and have been here for some period already, Your Honours.  We also have the Italian police officer.  We are waiting to hear from the registry as to when there may be an Italian interpreter who is available to assist the Trial Chamber and we will be advising Your Honours when we receive that information.

That would leave the -- sorry, Your Honours.  Um, I can formally advise Your Honours that there was a witness with the pseudonym of CBX who we are formally advising Your Honours that we do not intend to call, to try and reduce our witness list.  That leaves the three named detainees, CNJ, CBR and CDL.  If we can conclude some or all of their testimony next week, then those who have concluded their evidence can be returned to Rwanda.  For those who have not concluded their evidence, it may not be the right forum here to discuss where we proceed to from the end of next week.
I'm not sure in terms of Your Honours' availability, counsels' availability, of a court availability -- it would seem to me, Your Honours, that we would need, perhaps one week after next week, maybe less, depending on the length of cross-examination, to conclude the evidence for the Prosecution.

Now, in the motion that was filed, Your Honours, I, in fact, had said the 17th of December or some other date that the Trial Chamber deems appropriate.  Clearly, Your Honours, I simply picked a date because I'm unaware of when we may next be able to have a week to conclude the testimony of the witnesses.  But certainly, the Prosecution wishes to, as I say, give priority to the civilians who have taken time off work so they aren't forced to take additional time off work.

Does that answer Your Honour's questions?  Or if you have other questions of me, please, I will do my best to answer them.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Pognon, we will give you the floor shortly after that.  I would like the Prosecutor to give the order of appearance of witnesses.  On the basis of what he just said, I have the feeling that there is some confusion somewhere.
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour.  After CBN, who is the present witness, the listed witness was CNJ.  Now, he is a detainee.  The witness following CNJ, that was listed, is CBK, who is a civilian witness.  It would be the Prosecution's submission that we, after CBN, whose testimony presumably will conclude sometime on Monday, that we go to CBK.  That would leave one --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
There is a problem.  You told us earlier, CNJ, CBK, and now you say that after the witness who is now testifying, it will be CBK.  We do not understand you.

There was a problem with the interpretation.  Now you are saying that, after the witness who is now giving evidence, we will hear the evidence of CBK and then that of CBY.  And after these witnesses, which witness would you like to call?
MR. MOSES:
Subject to there being an Italian translator available, there is an Italian policeman who is simply to produce documents, and he is in Arusha.  We have been waiting for advice from registry as to -- his name, his surname is Materassi.  Unless we receive advice that there is a translator available for him, clearly we won't be able to hear his evidence until there is that situation.  So those are the civilians.  They are the non-detainee witnesses.  That would leave three detainees, and we would propose to call them in the order of appearance that we have previously indicated: namely, the first detainee would be CNJ; followed by C, B for Bravo, R; and, finally, C, D for Delta, L.  That would be the conclusion of the Prosecution case.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We understand what you are saying.  We thank you for this information.  If we have understood properly then, one witness will not be appearing; the other Italian who was supposed to appear will also not appear.  Now I turn to the Defence.
MR. MOSES:
I'm sorry, Your Honours.  In respect of other Italian, we haven't received advice in respect of his travel arrangements yet, and the Prosecution, I think it's fair to say, are weighing up whether to call that person whose evidence would only, I think, take ten minutes in any event, as far as the evidence in-chief is concerned.  He is not in Arusha in any event, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  I turn to Counsel Monthé.
MR. MONTHÉ:
The Defence has properly noted down what the Prosecutor has said.  We have CBK, CBY, and perhaps Mr. Materassi.  I would like to point out to your Chamber, Madam President, that on the 23rd, we will not be in town.  Consequently, if this schedule does not suit us, we will not be included.  For us, it is something sacred.  Bearing in mind our timing, we want to point this out so that there shouldn't be any errors.  We want to point it out to your Chamber.  I thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Monthé.  This was, indeed, what we had agreed to, that we would meet only up to the 22nd.  I think the Prosecutor will need an extra week in order to finish its case, and you are telling us that you absolutely have to go on the 23rd.  Could you give us a date when you could return to hear the witnesses who will not fall within this time frame, up to the 23rd?
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I would suggest that I and my excellent colleague Pognon should confer with one another to see what we can come up with because our schedules are very, very tight and, unfortunately, it can only be in 2005 because we cannot cut short our programme regarding other matters we have to deal with.  As you can see, Madam Witness, (sic) we also have to meet our witnesses and investigators, so we have a lot of work on our hands.  Thank you.
MR. MOSES:
Your Honours, may I make a brief suggestion.  If -- perhaps as far as the order of detainees is concerned, if Your Honours initially extend it for another week or two, by the end of next week we will perhaps have a better idea as to when we may be going to meet again.

I can then contact WVSS.  It may be that they decide that we need to return the detainees, but then we will need to make a fresh application, get another letter from the minister of justice in Rwanda and go through that process.  But I -- it may be that WVSS considers that as the best alternative, or alternatively they may say we can keep the detainees in Arusha until whenever, some period in the distance, in which case we can then approach Your Honours to extend again the length of time that the detainees will be here or, alternatively, we can advise Your Honours that they will be returned to Rwanda and transferred back again.

So perhaps if I could ask Your Honours, so far as the motion is concerned to initially, additionally give a date in a week or twos' time.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank the parties for all this information.  We, therefore, request the Defence to confer with one another in the event where you will not be here on the 22nd.  If it is not possible to hear all the witnesses, it is possible to come in November, early December, so that -- before the Christmas break so that we can hear the witnesses.

Now we will take this order which is very urgent, and this is the order from the Chamber.  The Chamber is urgently seized of the Prosecution motion to extend the period of temporary transfer of the detainees under Rule 90 bis.  It is from the 15th of October 2004, filed before the registry of the Tribunal of the same date -- considered this order for temporary transfer of detained witnesses on the 19th of August 2004, present in Arusha, for a period of a month; consider that these witnesses -- CNJ, CBR and CDL -- have not yet been heard. The Chamber orders the extension of the period of transfer -- of temporary transfer of said -- the following -- the abovementioned witnesses up to the 31st of October 2004.  If this proves necessary, of course, we will extend the time limit.

We thank you all.  Have a good weekend and see you on Monday at 9 a.m. in this courtroom.
(Court adjourned at 1420H)
