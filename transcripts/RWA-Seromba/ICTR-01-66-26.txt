MADAM PRESIDENT:
Trial Chamber III is now in session.  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  We shall continue with the cross-examination of Witness CDL, if there are no outstanding issues.  Very well.  We give the floor to Mr. Monthé.  

The witness has had a problem?  Yes, Witness, we can hear you. 
THE WITNESS:
I had a problem last night.  I was listening to the news on the radio, an international radio station.  Reference was made to my testimony, and I think that what I said was distorted, at least for the part of the broadcast that I listened to.  On that programme, it was said that as regards my testimony, that the bulldozers came to destroy the church pursuant to a decision by the préfectural authorities.  Now, to my knowledge, I did not give such information.  

Another error regarded the number of victims who perished at the church when it was destroyed on that Saturday.  I believe that I explained that the number of victims was approximately 1,500.  However, that programme said that the number of victims who perished at that place was 1,500.  I believe that I said that on the 15th of April people were killed in the courtyard of the church and that they were buried.  Consequently, the figure of 15 hundred that I gave regards the number of people who were killed the day the church was destroyed by the bulldozers, only that day, on that specific place.  But of course there are other victims who perished in the surrounding areas of the church.  

As such, I believe that that information that was broadcast was not correct, and I don't know if the Tribunal has a problem with that.  I'm simply pointing this out and giving you what I think about the situation.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we will reassure you that what is said in the media is not at all that which would be considered by this Tribunal.  Furthermore, we did not listen to that broadcast.  What is important for us is what is said here, in the courtroom.  Everything is written down in the court transcript.  If you have a particular problem yourself, you can deal with that problem with the media.  But as regards us, what is said in the media will not bear on any decision that this Tribunal makes. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.  I was simply saying this because when such information is broadcast by an international station such as the BBC, I don't think that is a good thing.  Look at Rwandans, for example.  They listen to that radio station.  Perhaps they're going to base their opinions on that information.  And it's all the more interesting since the journalist said that he was based here in Arusha.  They need to report their information as accurately as possible.  That is all I wanted to say, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.  

Mr. Monthé, you have the floor. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, Your Honours, good morning.  Good morning.
WITNESS CDL
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	Mr. Witness, yesterday when we adjourned we were having a conversation.  I would like to pick up where we left off.  My first question is the following.  You said in this courtroom before this Chamber yesterday that in 1994 at Nyange parish the priest at that location was Athanase Seromba.  Is that correct, sir?
A.	That is correct.  When Father Seromba arrived at Nyange parish, his superior was Father Stratton.  He was transferred to Nyundo.  After that, the priest in charge was Father Seromba, so, I don't believe I am mistaken when I tell you that he was the ranking priest there.
Q.	Must I understand, Witness, according to you, that Father Stratton was replaced by Father Seromba, or was Father Seromba already there when Father Stratton was transferred and left?
A.	Father Seromba lived at the parish when Father Stratton was still there, but Father Stratton was still in charge. 
Q.	Did you know Father Gasake?
A.	Yes, I know him.
Q.	What his responsibility at the parish?
A.	Father Gasake had just arrived, so during that period you didn't see him very often. The person you did see was Father Seromba.
Q.	We are speaking about the priest.  Whether or not you see the person -- the priest is a position.  Was Father Gasake the priest who replaced Father Stratton?  That's my question. 
A.	I'm telling you what we were able to see.  As regards representation within the parish at the time, the person who represented the parish at that time was Father Seromba. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, yesterday in your testimony you also stated to Madam Prosecutor the following. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I am referring to yesterday's transcripts, page 9, and this was testimony given in closed session.  Of course, I am referring to the draft French transcript. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  Referring to line 32 of the said transcript, just so we're all clear. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Oui, Madam Procureur. 
MS. ALEXIS:
If it was in closed session, now that we are in open session, ought counsel to read it? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If it was in closed session, Counsel, you will not be able to read that in open session.  That is correct. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I still want to refer to that draft transcript, and now I want to go to page 16, 
page 16, line 11.  I don't know if we have all located the passage.  Of course I am still referring to the French version. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, continue, Counsel.   
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, this was the question put to the witness in reference to Saturday 16 April, "Did you see anyone at all speak to him" -- and here we're referring to Father Seromba -- "in the morning at about 6:30.  That's when I arrived.  The bourgmestre went up to him.  He greeted him and they began to speak." 

Further on, at line 19, "The bourgmestre gave an example by shooting at someone who was on top of the church.  Thereafter, the attacks began, the killings began."  End of quote. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, at this point in time, I want to ask you if on that Saturday morning, before beginning the hostilities, the bourgmestre indeed went to meet Father Seromba. 
A.	(Microphone not activated) Let me repeat myself.  On that morning, I said that the bourgmestre went with police officers and other people, people who used firearms.  When he arrived, he found 
Father Seromba standing in front of the secretariat.  They greeted each other and began to speak.  The bourgmestre was standing next to him and gave the signal, as I will repeat and as I said yesterday. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I should like to ask you to refer to the letter of 16 April 1999.  This is a Prosecution document, K0335400, page 3 of the said document, if you have it; K0335400, document dated 
16 April 1999. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, you may proceed.  We have located the document. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, in the last paragraph -- this is on page 3 of the said document marked K0335400.  Thank you, Madam President.  This is a letter to the prosecutor of the republic.  And he says the following, "The next day, the 16th of April 1994, the bourgmestre personally gave the signal to begin the massacres by shooting at the tower of the church.  They then began to shoot at the church with a machine gun.  They were unsuccessful.  At about ten o'clock, the bourgmestre, the IPJ and the gendarmes agreed with Seromba to demolish the church."  

Madam President, in yesterday's testimony, the witness claimed that the bourgmestre arrived at 7:30 and began to speak with Seromba and gave the signal to begin the massacres. Yesterday is 
19 January 2005.  On the 16th of April 1999 he said something different.  

And so, Madam President, I should like to list a number of contradictions and then go through them one by one, with your leave, of course.  

Again, with your leave, Madam President, in the document --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, perhaps the witness can answer the question you've just put to him.
MR. MONTHÉ:
No, Madam President, I would like to first list them all out and then give him the opportunity to respond, but it is up to you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
One moment, Counsel.  Do you have a copy of the letter?  And if you do, maybe the witness can have that copy so that he can be able to follow the conversation. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
This was a letter disclosed to us by the Prosecution and I shall try to see if I have an extra copy. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.  This is not of great concern to me.  I don't need the document before me.  Most of my statements, I can remember them, and regarding this specific issue, as I already said, when I began my guilty plea and when I began to confess, we didn't say everything.  Even to this day I haven't said everything.  

So in April 1999, that was the very first letter that I wrote to the prosecutor.  I had just come back from exile.  It was a way to show that if you came back out of exile, you were ready to cooperate in order to restore security and social cohesion.  When we began to tell the truth, we began bit by bit.  We gave information step by step.  But if you look at all of my confessions, you will see that the first ones are not complete.  I said that the bourgmestre began the killing that day, but, for example, I didn't say that he talked with Father Seromba.  Perhaps at that time I didn't think that was entirely important.  

So what I can say to counsel for the Accused is the following.  Whether we look at the events at Nyange or elsewhere, you won't have the whole story by just looking at just one document.  Each time we finish with a document such as this one, we end with a very important phrase which says, "I am ready to give more information to anyone ready to hear that."  

So, if you ask a question about the bourgmestre, I can try to focus on that person, but perhaps in other documents I am not going to talk about the fact that he was there.  It depends on the context of the testimony you are asked to give.  These are simply observations that I wanted to make for the benefit of the Chamber. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you, Witness.  

Mr. Monthé, you may proceed. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, Madam President.  I would like to proceed, but I am hearing some very serious things.  This witness took an oath to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, and now he is saying that he hasn't said all of the truth, he hasn't said everything, and in fact he's here before us.  This is very serious.  I don't know who we are trying to trick here.  He's saying, "I haven't said the truth; I can change it at any point in time."  And I am very concerned about this, Madam President, very concerned indeed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor. 
MS. ALEXIS:
It would be remiss of me not to have placed on the record that that is not the intent and that that was not the nuance which I interpreted from what the witness said.  And I do not agree that the witness was saying that he was not telling the truth.  He was merely giving an explanation as to why in some instances his explanations had been more fulsome than other times, and might that be placed on the record. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
I am happy that we understood the same thing, Madam Prosecutor, that it was not the truth.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have duly noted the Prosecutor's observation.

Mr. Monthé, please put some questions to the witness and avoid interruptions.  Say exactly what you are trying to put through to the witness by way of questions.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I can't question a witness who is in the process of telling me that he is not telling the truth.  This is unacceptable.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We're sorry, Counsel, but we didn't interpret it in the same manner.  The witness never said that he didn't say the truth.  He would never come before this Chamber and say that he's come to the witness box to tell lies, because we would stop immediately his testimony.  He took an oath to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, and he is explaining why perhaps he did not give the full picture, all of the information, at any given point in time.  He never said that he wasn't telling the truth, Counsel.  So please proceed.  As I said, you put questions to the witness, he answers, and the Chamber shall draw conclusions thereafter.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, Madam President.  I was dealing with the document dated 16 April 1999, and I pointed out the discrepancies contained therein, and I shall proceed, Madam President.

K0335635, K0335635, that is the next document that I would like to refer to.  This goes up to --
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, if I may.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Counsel had read a document, a few sentences from a document and left it at that.  
Madam President, this is something that was disclosed by the Prosecutor, and we have no objections to counsel reading certain sections to the witness.  However, Madam President, it in my view cannot be just a matter of reading it for the record, but it must be put -- questions from it must be put to the witness and the witness thereafter must be given an opportunity to explain.  Counsel read the document, did not ask the witness any questions and is now moving on.  What then would be the import of having read it into evidence?  How then is the Court to assess it? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you may proceed.  I think that we are finished with those issues now. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  I am still dealing, Madam President, with the same problem that I pointed out to you earlier; namely, that I wanted to point out a certain number of inconsistencies.  They are trying to impede my progress, but I still want to move on.  

Now, there are some contradictions regarding this witness's testimony regarding the day and the event of 16 April 1994, inconsistencies with his statement and his statements yesterday.  I read the letter dated 16 April 1999, I was interrupted, and I would like to proceed now.  

Now I'll give you the reasons. This is Prosecution document K0335635 up to K0335651, page 16.  I am on the second paragraph, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have located the passage.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  Here is what the witness says in his letter.  "On the 16th of April 1994, Ndahimana gave the signal to recommence the killings.  He did so by firing a firearm.  Thereafter, communal police officers, gendarmes, as well as other people including Kabilisa, Rukara, 
Warrant Officer Habarugira, Ephrem Mukangahe and inhabitants of Kibilira began to -- rather, continued to fire at the church."  That is a contradiction with respect to yesterday's testimony.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, Counsel.
MR. MONTHÉ:
I want to put questions.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you are going to put questions to the witness.  If these are contradictions, you can present those in your closing arguments.  But you have to put this to the witness:  On a said day you said this and yesterday you said this.
MR. MONTHÉ:
That is what I am trying to do, Madam President.  I said I wanted to list out the contradictions and then put the question thereafter to the witness.

Madam President, we are still on the same statement.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What I am telling you is that you are making comments at the same time and that's what you should avoid.
MR. MONTHÉ:
The last document on this matter is the witness's letter of 25th January 2002, K0325032 (sic), K0335032, that's the code, the reference, up to K0335035, page 4.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Next time we shall ask you to provide us with the page reference earlier because sometimes we have difficulties in finding the place in the various documents that we have.  And this is to both the parties, please, for your attention.

Please proceed, Counsel.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  Last paragraph of that page, line 3, and I quote, "At about 8:00 a.m., I went to the church in order to see how to save this baby and also to follow up closely what was happening there.  On my way, I saw Bourgmestre G. Ndahimana and policemen going to the church and I followed them.  When they reached the church, they started shooting at the people who were at the bell tower after the bourgmestre gave the sign."

Madam President, my question for the witness concerning all these statements as is as follows.  My first is this:
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Mr. Witness, yesterday you testified here before this Court that the bourgmestre spoke with 
Father Seromba before he gave the signal for the attack to commence.  All your prior statements since 1999 up to today and even in your statement which is with the prosecutor, did you not know in 1999 that you were going to come to testify against Father Seromba?
A.	Thank you, Madam President.  Generally speaking, when testimony is given to the prosecutor, we speak about what is of importance to you and then we also provide general explanations.  Let me repeat.  If there is information that I didn't mention in any letter whatsoever, this would mean that what I wrote depends on the questions put to me by the investigator or the person questioning me or the date on which the letter was written.  If I didn't say that a certain person did not do this or that, it means I was not questioned about that particular aspect.

Now, I am being told that I did not say what is of relevance, but if you recognise what you have done before the prosecutor and you mention the witnesses who saw you, I must say that sometimes you may say it was between 7:30 and 8 o'clock.  To me, that is all very well because there's no contradiction and the Tribunal can consider what I did.  What is necessary is for me to say what my role was as a witness.

And let me repeat this before the Tribunal.  When I confessed in 1999, I confessed to certain aspects and I wrote about them.  But if I consider what I said in the year 2002, you will realise that I said many more things, and you will also note that I have not said everything here in court.  Elsewhere, I may say even more.  I know a lot about the events and concerning various persons and dealing with various facts which I have not been asked to speak about.  At the appropriate moment, I will speak about them.  So for me personally, we need to understand one another, and this on a progressive basis.  
What I know is that Father Seromba spoke with the bourgmestre.  You might ask me why I did not say that Father Seromba fired a shot.  It is very difficult to be specific when it comes to time.  Let me request that questions be put to me without too much emphasis being made, being placed, on the initial statements that I made.  I should not be asked why I did not say this or not initially when I was questioned.  In time, the Tribunals will come to understand what I should have said.

If you carry out investigations, you will realise that I have spoken about things which indeed took place, and different people will speak about different times.  The only difference, maybe, will be on the time.  Personally, I insist on speaking the truth here.  And I shall stand by that.  And if I am to refer to someone whom I had not mentioned earlier, that shouldn't be a problem.  Many questions are put to me, Your Honours, but one cannot speak about everything.

Your Honours, let me conclude here by saying that I have written certain pages at a given point in time and later on I wrote other pages.  In other words, I spoke about other issues.  The Prosecutor put to me different questions because I had indeed said that I was ready to provide further information at the appropriate moment, and I am ready to do so if that appropriate moment does arise.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you have the floor.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q. Mr. Witness, let's go back to the facts, and for me, the facts are your statements of 10th October 2001 before the investigators in this case, K0270481 (sic), and you are the one speaking; K0270785, page 5.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, K0770485, page 5, this is the first statement made by the witness, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, you may proceed. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  Thank you.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Now, Witness, this time around you are being questioned regarding Father Seromba, and that's why you are here.  And you are making your statement about the bourgmestre going to the parish, and here is what you said.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
It's paragraph 3, Madam President, Your Honours, in the first half of that paragraph.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	"The bourgmestre went to the church and I followed him.  A short while afterwards, the bourgmestre received a message encouraging him to return to the pharmacy and I followed him there too."

Why is it that here again you make no reference to Father Seromba, who allegedly met the bourgmestre on that day, that morning, the day of the attack?
A.	Thank you, Madam President.  As we have always repeated, it was said that the bourgmestre was cold so that he could go to the pharmacy.  I think that these are different times.

As we have said, the bourgmestre arrived, he spoke with Seromba, and a few moments later, people were shot at.  The time came for people to be shot at, and those who had gone to fetch the bulldozers went to tell the bourgmestre to discuss with Father Seromba so that they could decide.

For me, therefore, these are two different times.  Those who came to fetch the bourgmestre could not have necessarily gone to Father Seromba.  So for me, there is no reason for me to have mentioned Seromba if questions were not put to me about him.
Q.	Thank you.  Thank you, Witness.  Mr. Witness, were you an (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and filed under seal), or was it before he came into office?
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, I just wish to invite my friend that this is in open session.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Even in writing, Madam President, he can say yes or no in writing and we can move on.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The problem is that you have made reference to the position of the witness and this should be struck off the record.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you know that bourgmestre?
A.	Thank you.  Yes, I knew him.
Q.	*****************?
A.	************************, a short period of time.
Q.	Thank you.  What were your relations like, Mr. Witness?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please be very careful, Mr. Witness, because this question, and maybe your answer, may reveal your identity, so please be very careful in what you say, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you very much, Madam President.  In truth, I never had any problem with him in terms of what our relationships were.  ********************************************************************, but between us and in terms of what we did, there was no difficulty.  We didn't have any problem.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Witness, can you therefore then explain to the Chamber why in your letter of 16th April to which I made reference a moment ago, K0335300, at the end of that page --
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I hope that you are able to find the page.  The code is K00335403, K0335403.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Counsel, we are with you.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  The very last paragraph, Madam President, at page 4, and I quote.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	The witness is speaking, "I should not (sic) conclude by informing you that I did not get on very well with (By order of the Court, this name was extracted and filed under seal)?
MR. MONTHÉ:
Maybe, Madam President, I should not proceed with the reading.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You need to limit your reading because that may bear on the identity of the witness.
MR. MONTHÉ:
You see, I was anticipating what you were going to say, Madam President.  Maybe, 
Madam President, for us to deal properly with this issue, maybe we should go into a closed session.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, do you have another series of questions which could be put in a public session so that we can end with the closed session?
MR. MONTHÉ:
I would probably have questions, but here we are dealing with the planning of my work.  The closed session will be brief, I promise you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you have a problem in terms of your strategy, Counsel Monthé?
MR. MONTHÉ:
No, I have no problem, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If you insist that we move into closed session now, we can do so, but what I was saying is that we would have preferred to remain in open session so that we can deal with this issue later because we're touching on relations with the bourgmestre.  I was caught in the middle of the action.  If this destabilises you a bit, we can have the closed session. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
(Speaking over interpretation)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No.  What I am saying is I'm referring to your strategy, obviously.  If that destabilises you, we can go into closed session.

Madam Prosecutor, do you have any objection as to going into closed session now?
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, if the counsel wishes to go into closed session now, I have no difficulties.  The only difficulty I would have is that I would continue to diligently protect this witness as much as I could, so that if these questions may not be asked in an open session, I would be very, very pleased. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We do apologise to the gallery, but we shall be going into closed session for a few minutes and this is in the interest of the protection of the identity of the witness and also in the interests of justice.  Thank you.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript, [pages 13 to 15] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 1 to 12 by S. Eboe-Osuji)






















MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Monthé, we are now in open session.  You may proceed.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, yesterday you indicated to the Chamber that Father Seromba told the bulldozer operators to start on the side of the church where the sacristy was located, start on that side.  In your statement, that I don't want to reread, you said that Father Seromba pointed out the weak spots of the church so that it could be destroyed easier.

According to you, Father Seromba was a priest, he's not a civil engineer nor an expert in construction, didn't know how that church was built -- it was built before he was born.  How could he be in a position to know which parts of the church were most vulnerable so that it could be destroyed easier? 
A.	Thank you.  As I said, Father Seromba is not a builder, but as a priest, perhaps he does know how churches, in general, are built.  He knows the different parts of a church.  If you live in a house, you know where the kitchen is located, where the bedrooms are and so on and so forth.  I think this is general knowledge that priests possess.  He knows the different parts of the church and what happens in those different parts.  I don't think we need to have a civil engineering degree to know these types of things.

I didn't say that he was present when the church was built, but as a priest of the Catholic Church, he had already spent several years in a church.  Well, he knew the different parts of it.  He should have known what went on in each one of the rooms in that church.

And so I think general knowledge would say that he would know this kind of thing.  He didn't need to have specific knowledge in civil engineering to know about those matters.
Q.	Witness, just for your knowledge, I wanted to tell you that Father Seromba was appointed to Nyange church at the end of September 1993.  He had not spent several years there.
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, what is the evidential value of these diatribes, harangues, sentences, paragraphs made by the Defence counsel which are not questions?  This is not the local shop.  There is no reason for Defence counsel to be continually telling the witness things for his knowledge.  Is there a question or is there not a question?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, you are continuing in the same vein.  Simply put questions to the witness and avoid commentary.  You may proceed.

BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, those events occurred at Nyange.  You were there almost every day.  How many clergy members did you see there?
A.	Over that two-day span when I was at the parish, I think that I saw four priests.
Q.	Can you tell us which priests were there?
A.	During that period, I saw Father Seromba, Father Gasake, but in fact I didn't know his name.  Later on, people called him Kizigenza, but I don't know his name, really.  I never spoke with him.  I don't know him very well.

I saw those two priests, and they lived at the parish.  I also saw Father Kayiranga, as well as 
Father Nturiye.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  During that period when you saw them, what were those men doing, the ones you have just listed?
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I've given much testimony about that subject.  I always saw Father Seromba outside the church.  As regards the other priests, I saw them when I went inside the presbytery.  There, I found Kayiranga, Nturiye and the other priest.
Q.	Were they following the events that were occurring at the parish, according to you, Witness?
A.	In fact, they were in their rooms.  I didn't follow what was going on there, but given what was happening at the church, I would say that when I saw them -- and you also see this in the different documents that are available to you, that I went inside.  I went to pick up a child who had been left there by his mother.  Kayiranga showed me the child and where the child was.  Kayiranga was with the said priests.  I saw them inside the building.  I saw them within the building.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You saw them inside the building.  After the events at Nyange, did the priests that you mention, Nturiye and Kayiranga, were they prosecuted for the same reason Father Seromba was prosecuted, to your knowledge, Witness?
A.	Fathers Kayiranga and Nturiye were prosecuted in Rwanda, but I do not know if they were charged with the same crimes as Seromba.  I do not know.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Can you tell this Honourable Chamber, Witness, if you participated in those trials.
A.	Yes, I did.
Q.	How did you participate?
A.	Towards ************************************************************ showed up and asked me ************************************************* person. 
Q.	Witness, can you remind the Trial Chamber, ***************************, what the verdict was.
A.	I think that in the *********************************, both priests were sentenced to death.  As for ********************, he was convicted to life imprisonment, and the white person who was implicated was acquitted.  I think that in the appeals court, both of those priests were acquitted.  But to my knowledge, the person nicknamed ******** had his sentence confirmed by the appeals chamber.  I believe that summarises the court of appeals decision regarding those trials.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You spoke at length about Gaspard Kanyarukiga.  Prior to the events, did you see him go to Nyange parish?
A.	I can't say that I saw him going to Nyange parish.  I saw him when he came to Kivumu commune, and if we are at the centre together, we could meet there, but I did not say that I saw him go to Nyange parish.
Q.	Do you know if he had a relationship with Father Seromba?
A.	I don't know.
Q.	Do you know if he had any responsibilities within the Catholic Church?
A.	I don't know.
Q.	How could he give instructions to Father Seromba and join him in destroying the church?
A.	As stated in my statement and in my testimony, people who collaborated at that time, given the circumstances, necessarily were friends -- or weren't necessarily friends.  Gaspard Kanyarukiga was a businessman who lived in Kigali.  From time to time, he came to our commune.  He set up a pharmacy in our area and he began to visit the church, but I didn't say there was necessarily a friendship between himself and Father Seromba.

However, after the bourgmestre held a meeting with Kanyarukiga and his colleagues, I said that they went to talk to Father Seromba and explain to him the decision that was taken in the meeting, so that he executed.  I never said that Kanyarukiga himself went to speak with the father to destroy the church together.  That is a distortion.  In fact, the way you put it is a distortion, Counsel, of what I said.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Were you questioned by different IPJs in Rwanda in 1997, '98 and '99 as regards the events at Nyange?
A.	Yes, I was questioned by judicial police officers, both on the commune level as well as the provincial level.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Yesterday you told us, Witness, that you are still awaiting trial.  Is that correct, Witness?
A.	That is correct.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Beware of your question, Counsel.
THE WITNESS:
I've been waiting for my trial for a long time.  I've been detained since 1997.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, given your situation, when you come to testify in Arusha, will you receive any leniency in your trial?  Is that a reasonable statement?
A.	In my view, whether one is testifying before the Arusha Tribunal or any court whatsoever, that doesn't have any bearing on what I am saying.  I think maybe what is relevant is the number of cases to be tried or other aspects, but I don't think there is any influence on my -- or there is no connection between my testimony and my sentencing.  I know that there are people who come to testify -- who testified a long time ago before the Arusha Tribunal and they are still in detention.  I don't think that has any bearing on their cases.  I don't think that one ought to come here and expect to have some kind of leniency from the courts.  When the guilty plea trials began, we were asked, and we understood that we needed to speak the truth by the events we were being questioned about, obviously, depending on the questions that were put to us.

In the event that the Rwandan courts believe that testimony before a Tribunal can constitute a mitigating circumstance, that might be a good thing, but that's not upon me.  Thank you.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you state, under K0335653, page 19 --
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, it's at page 19, one-nine.  It's the record of the interview, Madam President.  It's after the note, and the witness says, "Some persons, by form of revenge, wrongly accuse me for distorting facts because I made allegations against them in my confession.  They want to make me understand that my confession will be considered pointless."
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	What do you mean by that?
A.	Thank you.  When I express myself in such terms, as I have already stated elsewhere during the guilty plea and confession of guilt proceedings, persons are denounced, and when you denounce someone and you say that he was a co-perpetrator of an offence, that person can want to revenge and make allegations, false allegations, about you.  And in so doing, the office of the prosecutor or the prosecutor himself may rely on those false allegations and tell you that your confession is not complete or they are simply set aside.  Consequently, there are persons whom I have denounced who occupied positions in Kivumu commune.  And it wasn't in order to please them, but they claim that I ***************************************************************************************************************.  But all they are doing is to have my confession questioned so that it can be rejected or set aside.

When you have a guilty plea and confession of guilt session, there are advantages therein because you could probably have your sentence reduced.  That comes from the law which is now in force.

But, now, these persons whom I denounced really wanted to see the failing of my guilty plea to which I had recourse.  I don't know whether such explanation is adequate.  If that is not the case, I can try and give you further examples.
Q.	Your explanation is sufficient for me.  Can one therefore say that when you have recourse to a confession, you expect sympathy from the authorities?
A.	When you have recourse to the guilty plea and confession of guilt procedure, one cannot assume that the authorities will look upon you kindly.  First of all, you need to -- they will need to examine your confession in compliance with the organic law in force.  But in the final analysis, one might say that if your confession is considered as complete, it can be considered as having -- as you having made a contribution to justice, and this may have a bearing on the sentence of those persons who have had recourse to a guilty plea and confession, because sometimes such sentences impose upon persons who are imposed (sic), and those who have not confessed may not be as lenient.
Q.	When was the last time you saw Father Gasake for the last time?
A.	As I have said, I saw him in the incident I described.  It was during the attack on the church.  I had not seen him earlier.  I didn't know him.
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Witness, you who are an intellectual someone, who is learned -- this is my last question.  In other words, someone who has some education.  We have the notion of the good father of the family in terms of priests.  So do you think that a priest can actually organise such an event, the destruction of his own church?
A.	Judging from what I knew before the war, I respected Father Seromba and I considered him as a father figure, someone who watches over the population, especially the people in Kivumu commune.
Q.	Thank you.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, Your Honours, I have no further questions for this witness.  Once again, thank you.  Maybe my learned friend Pognon wishes to say something.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I do beg your pardon.  What were you saying, Mr. Pognon?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel's microphone is not on.  I'm sorry.
MR. POGNON:
I think that I had said earlier that my learned friend would deal with the cross-examination, and if there was anything further, I may have some questions.  And I do have some questions to put to the witness, Madam President, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you have the floor, but this is quite unusual.  Normally, it's either one or the other of counsel who takes care of the cross-examination and not both.
MR. POGNON:
We chose this strategy because there are some witnesses remaining and we wanted to ensure that we put all the questions to the witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I suppose in that case that you will be brief because it was Mr. Monthé who was responsible for 
cross-examination.  We gave you all the time necessary, so please be as brief as possible.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	You occupied the position about which you spoke at length here before you became a *******.  You are someone who is educated.  Now, whilst you were in an *****************, did you come to know about the legal instruments concerning your activities; namely, the law on ************************ and the decree law on the gendarmerie?
A.	I would say that I didn't go out of my way to find out about the contents of the laws to which you are referring now.
Q.	Thank you.  Please say yes or no.  Are you of the opinion that in the ************** you occupied, alongside the person whom you well know, you were responsible for security; you were responsible for security per se and public order?
A.	Yes, I agree that that is everyone's responsibility, not only persons in authority.  Any citizen has that obligation.
Q.	Let's be specific.  It is the responsibility of persons whom, on behalf of the state, govern the local area over which they are responsible.  It's the person upon whom the state has invested certain powers.  Is that not true?
A.	Yes, we agree on that.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, in order to do that, for authority to be exercised, that function pertaining to security and law and order, do you agree that the same rules, the same law applies to policemen and the various members of the population over whom they work in the commune?
A.	Please go ahead, Counsel.  I don't understand where you are going, because you are making proposals to me and you are asking me whether I should say yes or no.  I don't know whether we are opening a discussion here or what.

I cannot deny that I was responsible for security.  Everyone should be responsible for security and public law and order.  So as an official, I was responsible for security.  But, as it is said, in Rwanda, it is the most senior member of the group responsible who is taken to task.  You know that, according to law, I had certain duties and obligations which I did not necessarily fulfil.  I had explained myself on that.  I don't really know what we are discussing here.
Q.	I am talking about the functions that you had in the position that you held in relation **********************.  I am trying to be careful here.  So what I was saying is that as *********************************--
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I am sorry.  I think we are going to slippery terrain.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I am trying to be very careful.  I am reading a document, and after that I will have one or two questions, but I need to be able to introduce my document.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, I do wish that you introduce your document.  But my concern is that you do not reveal the identity of the witness, and I am reminding you of this concern and I want you to think about it too.  But I also wish to tell you that we are approaching very slippery ground.  Maybe --
MR. POGNON:
I have overall about four questions.  Maybe I should go directly to my questions, then, if that might be better. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor.
MS. ALEXIS:
Yes, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
There is a request for a closed session.  I want to hear you on that.
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, anything to protect the identity of my witness, I would not be objecting to.  I merely wish to place on record that we find the procedure of two counsel cross-examining the same witness to be very peculiar.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you are quite right.  We are therefore going to go into a closed session.  We apologise to the public, but this is in order to protect the identity of this witness and we are going about this procedure in order to ensure that the interests of justice are respected and adhered to.
THE INTERPRETER:
Could registry kindly inform the counsel to use the lectern so that his microphone is closer to him.  We're finding it very difficult to hear him.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [page 23] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Trial Chamber is now in session.  Prosecutor, I see the witness is here.

Good morning, Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are protected witness for the Prosecution and your pseudonym is CBR.  You will be questioned by the Prosecutor.  After that, you will be cross-examined by the Defence.  If necessary, the Judges may also put questions to you.  Before we begin with your examination-in-chief, we should like to ask you to take a solemn declaration.
(Declaration made by Witness CBR in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, thank you, Witness. Witness, we ask you that you attentively listen to the questions that are put to you and that you answer them specifically and concisely. 

Prosecutor, you have the floor for the examination-in-chief of this witness.
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour.  Just for the record, counsel's name is Moses.
WITNESS CBR,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Good morning, Witness CBR.
A.	Good morning, Mr. Prosecutor.
Q.	You should have in front of you a document --
MR. MOSES:
Apparently he does not.  

I'll just ask the registry to show a document to the Judges and the Defence and have it shown to you.
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness CBR, do you see the document that has been placed in front of you?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And does that document contain your personal particulars, and did you sign it earlier today as those details being true and correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Thank you.
MR. MOSES:
Your Honours, I would ask now that that document be produced as Prosecution P. 23.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objection from the Defence?  Very well.  Identification sheet for Witness CBR is tendered as a Prosecution exhibit.  It shall be marked P. 23.  Said document shall be placed under seal.  You may proceed, Mr. Prosecutor.
(Exhibit No. P. 23 admitted, under seal)
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness CBR, how did you hear about the death of President Habyarimana?
A.	Télesphore Ndugutse spoke to me about that; also the news was broadcast over the radio.
Q.	And do you remember the date you found out about the death of President Habyarimana?
A.	Yes, it was on the 7th of April, 1994.
Q.	Who was Ndugutse?
A.	He was a teacher, *************.
Q.	And what did he tell you?
A.	He was leading us during the attacks.
Q.	What did he tell you about the death of the president?
A.	He told me that the head of state had died, and that we had to avenge that death.  He told us that the head of state had been killed by the Inyenzi, and he told us that the Inyenzis were the Tutsis, in fact.
Q.	And in terms of avenging of the death of the president, did he give you any instructions on that day, the 7th of April?
A.	Yes, he gave us instructions.  He was clear in saying that we had to attack ************************, rather, who was called Ndakubana.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, do you know where the Nyange Catholic Church is or was in 1994?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And approximately how long would it take to walk from where you live to the Nyange Catholic Church?
A.	If you walked quickly, you could get there in a half an hour.  If you walked at a normal peace, you could make it in 45 minutes.
Q.	Now, did you ever go to the Nyange Catholic Church in the period in the weeks after the death of President Habyarimana?
A.	I didn't entirely understand your question.
Q.	I'll rephrase it.  Did you ever go to the Nyange church during April 1994?
A.	Yes, I went there.
Q.	And why did you go there?
A.	During that period there was an IPJ called Kayishema who came into our cellule in a vehicle.  He spoke on a megaphone asking us to come to the rescue of the parish.  That is why I went to the parish.
Q.	Do you remember the date that you saw Kayishema in the vehicle?
A.	Yes, I remember the date.  The first time it was on the 14th of April 1994.
Q.	Do you remember what day of the week that was?
A.	Yes, I remember.  It was a Thursday.
Q.	Did you recognise the vehicle that Kayishema was travelling in?
A.	Yes, the vehicle belonged to a businessman called Rinamasirabo, it was commandeered from Rinamasirabo.  Rinamasirabo, in fact, was a Tutsi.
Q.	All right, and briefly, can you describe what the vehicle looked like?
A.	It was a white Toyota.
Q.	Thank you.  Now prior to Kayishema coming around on the 14th of April, had you been given any earlier indication that there may be a decision to attack the Tutsi at -- attack the parish, sorry?
A.	Yes, we were given instructions, and Ndugutse, Télesphore, gave the orders to us.
Q.	What did he tell you?
A.	On the 7th he told us to go and attack Gregoire Ndakubana and to kill the members of his family and that we should do so to avenge the death of the president who had died.  So, we went to Ndakubana's house on the night of the 7th.  We killed two people there, and we wounded others.  In the morning the authorities from the commune came to bury the dead, because we left them on-site.  Those who had been wounded were brought to the hospital by Rinamasirabo.
Q.	I'll go back to my question because it may not have been easily understood.  Before you saw Kayishema on the 14th of April, had you been told by anyone of any plan to attack those people who were at the Nyange church?
A.	Before Kayishema arrived, Télesphore Ndugutse came on the 13th of April.  There was a meeting at the commune office.  After that, he told us that the decision was made that we had to attack the people at Nyange church and kill the Inyenzi's there, in other words the Tutsis who were there.  This was on the 13th of April in the afternoon.  He told us that he had come from a meeting of communal authorities, and at that meeting they had decided that the only choice was to kill those Inyenzis who were there.
Q.	Did he tell you of any other decisions made at that meeting?
A.	Besides what I've just told you, in other words the decision was made to kill the Tutsis, he did not tell us about any other decisions made.  However, he did say that it was said, if it was impossible to kill those enemies, the Astaldi company was going to assist in doing the job.
Q.	Did he indicate whether the authorities were concerned about the people at the parish who had taken refuge there being armed?
A.	He said that during that meeting a decision had been made to identify, amongst the authorities, some of them who would go to ensure or to find out whether the refugees were armed or not, and it was decided that Kananye, who - Kananye Ruhogogongage (phonetic), who was an assistant, should go, together with Father Seromba, in order to find out whether the refugees were armed or not.
Q.	All right, if I can now take you back to the 14th of April.  You've told us how Kayishema came and visited your area where you were living.  What happened after Kayishema had left?
A.	After Kayishema's departure, Ndugutse gathered together the inhabitants of our cellule and convinced them that we must all go to Nyange, and that's what we did, we went to Nyange.  When I refer to Nyange, what I mean is the church.
Q.	And did the people who went to Nyange carry anything with them?
A.	We were carrying traditional weapons, in other words machetes, clubs and spears.
Q.	And did you go with that group to Nyange parish on the 14th?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can the Prosecutor please repeat the question for the benefit of the interpreter?
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Did you go with the group of people to attack at Nyange on the 14th?
A.	Yes, I left together with the group.
Q.	When you arrived at Nyange church, were there any other people there to join in an attack?
A.	Yes.  Our cellule made up a small group, and we had to wait for other people who were coming from other secteurs, especially that of Kigali.  I'm referring to Kigali secteur.  Please do not confuse that with the City of Kigali.
Q.	Thank you.  Approximately how many attackers were there at Nyange on the 14th of April?
A.	Actually, on the 14th we were relatively few because we had just arrived. 

I would suggest that there would be about 500 to 1,000 people, so in relation to the refugees we were relatively few.
Q.	And did you attack the people who had taken refuge at the church on that day?
A.	Yes, we did launch an attack, but the gendarmes stopped us because they said we were few in number.  So Ndugutse tried to convince them to let us go ahead, even if thereby it would be seen that we were few.  I must say, however, that the attack did not succeed.  The gendarmes left the place where they were.  We threw stones at the refugees and the refugees also threw stones at us, and since they were more in number than we were, we fell back and we went home.
Q.	And on your way home did you see anyone that you recognised?
A.	Are you referring to those who I was with?  I don't quite understand to whom you are referring to.  Are you referring to the group in which I was or are you speaking about any other persons I may have seen who were in the location?  Can you be a bit clearer for me?
Q.	Certainly.  Did you see any officials on the way home?
A.	When we were going back home on the 14th I didn't see any persons of authority except those who were together with us.  However, a businessman who normally lived in Kigali, one Gaspard Kanyarukiga came across our path; he spoke to Ndugutse as we went by, and he told him that he had just come back home but that he had seen some Inyenzi at Mushubati who were coming toward us, so that they could release the Inyenzis, and he was referring obviously to the Tutsis in the parish.  Consequently, he was saying that we need to look for reinforcements, so that we can come back and fight these people who had just repelled us.  After that conversation, Kanyarukiga continued on his way, and Ndugutse tried to explain to us what he had discussed with Kanyarukiga.  And that's how the day came to an end.
Q.	I now ask you to focus your attention on the following day, the 15th of April.  Did anything happen on the 15th of April; that you can recall?
A.	Yes, I remember something that happened on that date.  On the 15th of April 1994 Kayishema came back on the same vehicle I referred to earlier.  He went through our cellule, which has many roads, and he said, similarly that we needed to do something at Nyange church and get rid of the enemy; in other words the refugees who were there.  He continued on to other places, and the leader of our group, in other words Ndugutse, once again gathered the people together but, in fact, we weren't very far away.  We were well aware of the plan from the day before.  Vehicles belonging to the Astaldi Company came and we got onto them.  We were transported right up to the church, and I reached there at about nine in the morning.  I realised that there were already several people who had got there from all parts of the commune.
Q.	Thank you.  In terms of the number of people who were gathering there to attack, how did they compare to the previous day, which you've spoken about, the same number, less, more?
A.	The attackers on that day were more in number than those who had come the earlier day and even those who came on the first day.  The attackers on that day would have been five to six times more in number than those who had arrived the day before.  They had encircled the location.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, after you arrived there at the Nyange parish on the 15th, did you see any lead -- was there anyone who was taking a lead, leaders in the community?  Did you see anyone there?
A.	The officials were there, for instance Ndahimana, the bourgmestre; was present; Kayishema, the IPJ was also there; Habiyambere, the judge; Elias Sheba Rutese (phonetic) also was there; Vedaste Muragwabugabo, assistant bourgmestre also was there; as well as  Kanyarukiga.  These individuals were there in a building.  Subsequently, they left that building and they went to where the priests lived, then they came back to Codekoki, but I wouldn't be able to know what they talked, because I wasn't close by them.  

Later on, when they left the Codekoki building they said, "We need to launch the attack."  And we did so.  We attacked the refugees.  That's how we started throwing stones at the refugees and they did likewise.  At a given point in time, we withdrew and the refugees thought that they had the upper hand so they came out to the centre at a place known as Ishoshu.  There was one Rukara, who was a reservist.  He went onto the roof of the shops and threw grenades at the refugees.  Some refugees were killed and others turned back.  Rukara came down and continued to throw grenades at the mass of refugees; at the same time there were some of them who died.  We, ourselves, continued right up to the church.  Some of the refugees went into the church and had locked the doors.  Other refugees went into the presbytery courtyard; others still were killed on the courtyard, and others were able to flee into the woods which were nearby.  

Later on, when there were no more refugees left outside in the courtyard, we attacked those who had managed to enter the presbytery courtyard, but since the door leading to that courtyard was locked.  We had to break it down.  And that is when the priests and the gendarmes came and they stopped us from entering the presbytery courtyard.  During this time the authorities were asking us to stop the killings, and the priests asked that the killings be stopped, because there were many dead bodies and piles of stones which we had been throwing.  He asked us to remove the debris and the stones and the dead bodies.  Kayishema was there, together with others, and they asked us to stop the killings, Kayishema and Ndugutse, I mean they went to procure vehicles to help us to get rid of the dead bodies.  They found one *****************************************************************.  It was, in fact, that individual who was sent to go and contact the Astaldi officials so that the vehicles could be brought.
Q.	Witness CBR, if I can just go back a little bit, you've described how the attack took place on the 15th and how, at one stage, you went towards the priests' compound and you say that there was a priest with gendarmes there.  Was anyone leading your group, the people that you were with that tried to go to the priest's compound
A.	Yes, I think I've mentioned the person who was leading us, it was Kayishema and Ndugutse.  They were the ones who were leading the group of attackers who were trying to enter the presbytery courtyard to the extent that when the gendarmes and the priests came to the door or to the gate they came face to face with the leaders and they had a conversation.  Consequently other leaders, the officials, informed us of what had just been said and that's how things happened.
Q.	Was the name of the priest who was there with the gendarmes mentioned by your leaders?
A.	Yes, they mentioned the name of the priest, Ndugutse.  They didn't say father or priest, they said, "Seromba did not allow us to enter the presbytery court unless we removed the filth."  In fact, that's what was said, they didn't even talk about dead bodies.  And Kayishema and Ndugutse tried to convince the inhabitants who were there.  Furthermore, we weren't even arguing about what they were saying.  We couldn't contradict them because we were obeying their orders.  They spoke to the priest, and they told us what we needed to do.
Q.	And how far away were you from the priest that they called Seromba?  How far away were you when the priest was talking with those authorities?
A.	Let me apologise, but I believe I already -- I don't think I mentioned any conversation between a priest and others.  No, the priest was discussing with the officials and I was a few metres away, about ten metres away from those people.  I was in the courtyard of the parish, and I was some ten metres away from the priest and officials in question.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, were there many bodies in that vicinity at the time the instructions were given to remove them?
A.	Yes, there were many corpses.  If somebody knows of the size of the courtyard and the disposition of the compound, that person would understand there were many dead bodies in the courtyard and even alongside the road passing by the church.
Q.	Were you present -- well, were the bodies removed?
A.	Yes, I spoke of **********, who went to speak to those responsible for the vehicles in order to obtain them, but I didn't see ********* come back.  The vehicles were brought and they were handed to Kayishema.  The vehicles were two bulldozers and two lorries.  The bulldozers began to pick up the dead bodies and load them onto the lorries.  One of the bulldozers dug up a pit into which the bodies were to be placed, and the bodies were collected and dropped into the pit which had been dug close to the centre known as Ishoshu centre.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, maybe we should take our lunch break now and return at 2:30. 

Mr. Witness, we are going to resume a little bit later.  Let me remind you that you are still under oath and you should not communicate with anyone.  The session stands adjourned.
(Court recessed from 1233H to 1434H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Proceedings are called to order.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  

Mr. Moses, you have the floor to continue with your examination-in-chief of this witness.
MR. MOSES:
Madam President. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness CBR, prior to lunch we had been talking about the events at Nyange parish and, in particular, the events on Friday, the 15th of April.  You had told Their Honours how bodies of those who had been killed during an attack had been buried in a pit.  That's where we were up to prior to the lunch break.  

My first question for you is, were there any further attacks on the church and the refugees in the church on that day, namely the 15th of April 1994?
A.	On the 15th, after those bodies were buried, the attacks continued.  The communal police officers began to fire their weapons.  There were also reservists who were shooting inside the church.  They were shooting through the windows of the church.  This is near the bell tower and near the door, which was right near the tower.  And so some of the refugees, who were inside the church, tried to move away from that part of the church and gathered in a different part of it.  And later on the assailants brought a pump and they started to spray that part of the church with gasoline.  I'm talking about the main facade of the church.  Someone went onto a ladder and attempted to spray gasoline inside the church as well, and then they started the fire.  They used dried banana leaves to start the fire, and they tried to burn the main door, the front of the church, as well as the windows.  

Now, regarding the refugees inside the church, they were trying to protect themselves.  They used dust to try to put out the flames.  There were also blankets that they used to try to put out those flames, but sometimes the blankets themselves caught on fire.  It was a confusing situation.  They shot again at the refugees and the fire had opened a hole in the door.  After that, they brought in dynamite to try to destroy the church.  But, in the end, they were unsuccessful.  They tried to blow up the church with dynamite and they put sticks of dynamite into the church, but they were unable to destroy it.  And so, after that, they decided to delay the attack until the next morning.  In fact, they had run out of ammunition.  Among the attackers, there were people who came from Kibilira commune. They had just arrived on site.  Regarding those persons who had just arrived, a decision was made that they should stay on-site to make sure that the refugees couldn't run away.  They said that the bourgmestre wasn't there, and he was in charge of the ammunition.  He had gone to a burial of an important person, a doctor who had died, and he was related to that doctor.  So he went to that burial ceremony for that person who it was said was killed by the Inyenzis. 

So we withdrew and the people from Kibilira remained on-site.  When I left I heard Ndugutse and Kayishema say that they were going to look for some kind of reward to give to those assailants who were going to stay on-site.
Q.	Thank you.  Can I now focus your attention on the following day, that is Saturday the 16th of April?  Did you return to Nyange church on that day?
A.	Yes, I returned on the 16th.
Q.	If I can just interrupt you there, please, approximately what time did you go to the church on that day?
A.	Do you mean on the 16th?
Q.	That's correct.
A.	I arrived very early in the morning between 6 and 7, but of course, I wasn't wearing a watch.  I'm only making an estimate.  Once again, other people were already there when I arrived, and those present on that day were larger in number than those found there on the 15th, the previous day.
Q.	Thank you.  Did you see any people in authority who were present there on that day, namely Saturday the 16th?
A.	Yes, authorities were there.  The bourgmestre was there, namely Ndahimana.  Kayishema was also there, he was the IPJ or the police inspector; Joseph Habiyambere was there, a businessman; Kanyarukiga was there; Telesphore Ndugutse, the teacher; and the head of the MRND was there.  Also the head of the Kivumu Popular Bank was present.  Vedaste Murangwabugabo was also there and he was an assistant bourgmestre.  Once again, those people went into the presbytery courtyard and then they came out.  That is when the bourgmestre, Kayishema, went close to the church and opened fire on the church itself.  But in the meantime, the priest stayed in the presbytery.  I didn't see him.  So they tried to shoot at those people, but they were unsuccessful.  Then a decision was made to bring machines that had been used the previous day.  They had been brought back.  So Kayishema was in charge of getting the machines.  There was another vehicle belonging to the Astaldi company and then another vehicle, but I don't know where that came from.  They were transporting more attackers to launch more attacks on the church.  

So the machinery arrived, and they began to destroy the church, but I should point out that I do not know who gave the order to begin to destroy the church.  I saw the machines at work.  They started to destroy the building at about ten o'clock in the morning.  The walls started to come down on top of the refugees who were inside the building.  At about 4 p.m. or perhaps 5 p.m., the tower came down.  It was the last thing to come down.  

When I left the area they were sorting through the bodies, sorting it from the debris that was there.  They had to bury a newly dug pit, and that pit was just behind the church.  So I was leaving, and at that point they were sorting out the bodies from the bricks and debris that had fallen onto the courtyard.  A vehicle loaded the bodies and went to dump them into the pit that had been dug.  This is what I know about that specific day.

	1500H
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  If I can just go back a little bit and ask you a couple of details regarding the evidence you've just given.  On that day, namely, the 16th of April, did you see any priests?
A.	I haven't entirely understood your question.  Could you please repeat it for me, thank you? 
Q.	On the day that the church was bulldozed, did you see any priest, any of the priests -- priest or priests from Nyange parish?
A.	On the 16th, I saw Seromba in the morning, and only in the morning.  I didn't see him after that during that day.  Besides him, I didn't see any other priests.  However, on the 15th when there were the dead bodies lying on the ground, there were priests I saw, but I don't know where they came from or who they were and I saw them arrive to that site.  Their names were Father Nturiye, and Kayiranga.  I saw both of them arrive, but I did not see them after that.  I saw them when they arrived, not to ever see them again.  That is what I have to say about the priests.
Q.	You say that you saw Seromba on the morning and only on the morning of the 16th.  Where did you see him and what, if anything, was he doing?
A.	When I saw him, when the authorities were coming out of the courtyard from the presbytery, he was with them.  He was standing close to the door where he always stood and, in fact, I didn't see him do anything, nor did I hear anything about him.  I did hear something for the first time on that Friday, and only on that Friday.
Q.	All right.  Now, you have spoken about a bulldozer being used to destroy the church.  Did you know or recognise the driver or drivers of that bulldozer?
A.	With regard to the drivers of those bulldozers, there was one called Albert, he was Zairean; there was also one called Mitima who was also Zairean; there was a Maurice, also Zairean; and another person from Zaire whose name I do not recall; and another person from Kibilira, Nkinamubanzi, Anathase.  Those were the people operating those machines.  Now, regarding the truck drivers, I do not know who they were.
Q.	Were there many attackers near the bulldozers as they carried out their work?
A.	On that day, the 16th, there were many people, more than on the 15th.  There were so many people.  The crowd was so dense that there was even a risk of suffocation.
Q.	Now, you spoke about the tower of the church being the last part of the church to be destroyed.  Were you able to see any people who were refugees in the tower?
A.	Yes, there were refugees in the tower.  I don't know how they got there, but the fact remains that they went into the tower, and from the tower they were even throwing stones.  I have no idea, however, how they got into the tower, how they gained access into it.  I recognised one person in fact; Charles Kagenza was his name.  However, I cannot tell you how he got in and how they were able to survive because I saw him after the war; he was alive.  I have no idea how he survived. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, had you lived in the commune for all your life, the same commune?
A.	Yes, that is correct.  I've always lived in my commune and I only left it after I was arrested and imprisoned.
Q.	In your opinion, who were the most important people in the commune?
A.	According to what I saw in the commune I lived in, the people who seemed the most influential and important, those who had the respect of the population included the bourgmestre; the judge was also an important person; the police inspector; the IPJ was an important person; the priest was also an important person within the community; and then some rich businessmen who were important.  These people had the respect of the commune.  Now, there are other categories of persons who were also influential; otherwise, the persons that I have just listed were respected by the population and the population listened to them.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, you have spoken about having seen a priest by the name of Seromba on the Friday the 15th, and also on Saturday, the 16th of April 1994.  Had you seen that person prior to the 15th of April 1994?
A.	Before the 15th of April I had never seen him.  Even though I was a Christian and a Catholic, I didn't normally go to mass.  This is because we had been unable to have children and, in truth, I did not attend mass.  I was not a practising Christian; I, rather, went to witch doctors because, as I have told you, we were unable as a couple to have children. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, you have told us, however, that you saw him, Seromba, on two separate occasions.  I know it has now been more than ten years, but do you think you could recognise Seromba if you saw him today in Court?
A.	As you rightly said, it was ten years ago, but I can try and see if I can recognise him if I were to be given the opportunity to meet him even if it was a long time ago since I last saw him.
Q.	Perhaps if you could stand up, and have a look around the courtroom and tell Their Honours if you recognise anyone that resembles the priest who you saw on the 15th and 16th.  Perhaps if you just stand up.  
A.	Are you talking about this courtroom, Mr. Prosecutor?
Q.	Yes.  If you could stand up where you are in the witness box --
A.	I have a problem with my sight.  I shall try and look around.  I do think it's that person over there, the second person from the end, that is, the person to my left.  So maybe this man occupying the first position and -- I'm speaking about the one in the second place.
Q.	Well, do you see there are, in fact, three people sitting in that row?  Is the first one, the one in the middle, or the one on the end that you're pointing to?
A.	I'm speaking about the one who is in the middle; in other words, the second person.  Whatever side you begin from, it is the second person.
MR. MOSES:
Your Honours, I ask that the record reflect that he did point to the Accused, Seromba.  Thank you. 

BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, finally, are you currently a prisoner in Rwanda?
A.	Yes, I am in prison.
Q.	And have you admitted any charges in Rwanda, and if so what have you admitted to doing?
A.	Yes, I have made a guilty plea.  I personally killed two people, but I also participated in other attacks during which other people killed others -- attacks during which I didn't kill anyone.  If someone was killed at a location where I had been, I admitted to being there.  This was a period of war.  We would leave our homes with the intent to kill; that was the only objective.  We had been told that it was important, indispensable even, to look for the enemy and that the enemy was none other than the Tutsi, and that was the enemy who had to be killed; therefore, it had been necessary that I go along with the others with that objective in mind.  Consequently, I was obliged to kill.  Even when the attackers left before me, they would come and look for me because in my family there were Tutsis; we had had intermarriage with Tutsi families.  And so I was protecting them and, yet, I was supposed to accompany the killers.  I was ordered to kill and I did so.  I obeyed the orders.  At a given point in time, we were placed in detention so that we could kill the people we had been protecting.  I was told that a document was found in the home of my brother-in-law who had been hiding in my home.  In the beginning I was involved in the attack.  And since my younger brother was armed with a gun, I was afraid that maybe he could attack us.  And in order for us not to flee from our duties, we were placed under detention and we had to kill these people whom we had been trying to protect.  First of all, they had to place us in detention.  My younger brother who was a soldier and who had a gun was also placed under detention, he was placed in custody.  At the time when they came to arrest us, I was able to escape; however, the following day there was an attack on our home and those people were killed.  So, in brief, if I participated in those killings, including those at Nyange, it was in order for me to be able to protect people who were related to me by marriage.  Even at the church there were people whom I protected and to whom I tried to supply foodstuffs.  So the allegations made against me exist, and there are situations where I had wanted to kill, other people got there before me.  I therefore have to incline to any rulings made by the court. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, have you been sentenced in Rwanda for your -- the crimes that you have admitted?
A.	No.  No, I have not been tried; therefore, I have not come to any sentencing.
Q.	Yes, thank you.  Would you please answer any questions that my friends might have for you.
A.	Thank you.

CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Good afternoon.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	My name is Alfred Pognon and I am the lawyer for the person you've just recognised a moment ago, in other words, Father Seromba.  I just have a few questions to put to you in relation to the testimony you have just given.  

You made confessions which you have reiterated in your testimony here.  Now, here before me, I have a document which is your confession of guilt and this is a document we received from the Prosecution just before we came here a few days ago.
MR. POGNON:
The reference on the document is K0335267.  This was disclosed to us by the Office of the Prosecutor quite recently.  Now, this document is dated 25th January 2002.  I do not know whether the Bench has this document; 25th January 2002.  The reference is K0335267. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Counsel. 
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	This document is entitled, "Shedding light on events that took place at the Nyange parish in the month of April 1994".  In that document you made a list.  In a clear manner and in a chronological manner, you listed the events that took place, that from the 14th of April -- the 15th of April and right up to the 16th of April.  In that document, you only began to refer to Father Seromba from the 16th of April.  Only from the 16th of April do you mention Father Seromba; in other words, it was on that date, the 16th of April, that Muraginabugabo, Seromba and so on decided to destroy the church.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel was reading rather fast and this interpreter has not found where he is. 
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	In the testimony you have given before the Court --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, for the interpreter, could you please repeat the question and speak slowly please?
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	In the statement you have just said -- with the assistance of the Office of the Prosecutor, I realise that you said that, at any rate, you did not know who decided on beginning to destroy the church.  In any case, you said that they went to the presbytery, the priest accompanied them there and remained standing in front of the door.  After that they came and they started to destroy the church.  Is the version in your testimony the version the Court is supposed to take into consideration?  That is my question.  Which version are we supposed to take?  Is it the one that you were unable to say here before the Tribunal that the priest, Father Seromba, was involved in the destruction of the church?  That's my question.
A.	I didn't quite understand the question.  Could you kindly repeat it for me to be able to understand you? 
Q.	A moment ago you said that Father Seromba -- fortunately, you didn't speak much about him -- you said that Father Seromba, on that Saturday morning, was seen in the presbytery, that he went away with the -- he went back with the authorities and he remained at the door and that it was subsequent to that that the presbytery was destroyed, but that you could not state categorically that it was the father who was associated in any manner whatsoever with the destruction of the presbytery.  Can you clarify the situation for us?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, there's a small problem regarding that question because he said he does not know who gave the instructions for the church to be destroyed.
MR. POGNON:
Thank you very much, Madam President.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Do you stand by what you stated a moment ago which has been reminded me by the Presiding Judge; in other words, that you did not know who gave the orders for the church to be destroyed?
A.	Thank you.  Actually, apart from those persons in authority, and I do not know exactly who they were, I don't know that personally, what I was able to say is that it was those persons in authority who took the decision, but I do not know by name who made the decision, but I do know that the vehicles came in order to destroy the church, to demolish the church and the vehicles came about upon the request of those persons in authority.  What I'm trying to say is that I wouldn't be able to say that the father was with them when they took that decision, but here and now, before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, I can confirm that that decision was taken by the authorities, the decision to destroy the church, but they were coming from the priests' house.  Thank you very much, Madam President and Your Honours. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness CDR.  Let me take what you have said just a moment ago -- I'll come back to that at the end.  Coming back to what you said a moment ago, you spoke of a war.  You said that you were drawn into a war; is that what you were trying to say?
A.	Truly speaking, I was drawn into participating in the war.  The war began within the cellule within which I was living.  I was drawn into it.  I went to kill, but that was against my own will.  I was calculating the risk that I would be running if I were to refuse to do as told.  The order had been issued by the authorities and I realised that those who were participating didn't run any risk, but those who didn't participate had problems, so that is how I was drawn into the war, into the killings of 1994.  I do, therefore, admit that I participated. 
Q.	Thank you.  According to you, the fact that from the 10th, the evening of the 10th, Tutsis against whom the war had been declared were assembled at the church and at the commune office.  Was that something that you had ever heard of in the history of your country?
A.	You have just said that they gathered at the church and at the commune office from the 10th.  They started to do so much earlier; they began to assemble as from the 8th until the 13th.  And I was young.  I could hear the older people say that normally, even at the Nyange church, Tutsis had sought refuge and their lives had been spared.  I heard also that in 1973 Tutsis had hidden in Nyange church and their lives had been spared.  In 1990 I was an adult.  I was married.  People sought refuge in the church and their lives, once again, were spared.  At the time Tutsis had been attacked in their homes, they sought refuge in the churches and they escaped.  Now, in 1994 they sought refuge similarly in churches, and they thought they would be saved.  We even took some persons there thinking that they would be spared as we had been told by older persons.
Q.	Thank you very much for this very interesting piece of information.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can counsel please light his microphone so we can hear what he is saying?
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Now, according to you, is the fact that Tutsis assembled in the Nyange parish, given also the history of your country which you have recounted a moment ago -- now, the fact that these Tutsis were assembling in the church, was that not adequate for them to have their lives spared, as had happened earlier in the history of your country?
A.	Yes, that was adequate for them to have their lives spared, but the authorities had ill will.  If they had not been of such ill will, the Tutsis would have remained alive.  You, therefore, understand that it is truly shameful that we killed people, that we demolished houses.  It's, therefore, quite clear that if we had killed without destroying any buildings, maybe there would have been a few more who would have survived, but we destroyed buildings and many, many persons lost their lives.  You, yourself, are asking me a question, but I am sure you can understand quite well.  You will understand yourself that there was a fallout on us because we killed the people of God and we also destroyed God's church.  At least, there's a heavy weight on our hearts because of that.  The Bible states that any sin can be forgiven if there is indeed the desire to ask for forgiveness.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  According to you, Witness, during those days of the 14th, 15th and 16th, you believe that the Tutsis who were at the church saved those who were able to flee, had they not been killed.  Would the assailants have remained there up until they exterminated all of them?
A.	Given the situation at the time, the attackers were furious with the refugees; they could even relay one another to guard the refugees.  I can say that among the refugees the young ones could flee.  Even if they were under siege, they could flee.  They could have, but the church was destroyed and if the church hadn't been destroyed, some of them would have survived.  The attackers, those who led the war, the Inyenzis and the RPF -- the RPF could have arrived on site and saved some of the refugees just as they did in Kabgaye.  The people could have remained there and relieved one another.  The authorities, perhaps, could have made other decisions.  It was a fatal moment when the decision was made to demolish the church.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel's microphone, please.

BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Before we continue, do you know that in Rwanda -- or if in Rwanda there were other churches where killings took place, where there were people who took refuge and people who were exterminated?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, if you need a break, you're entitled to request one.
MR. MOSES:
I'm not sure if the witness realised Your Honour was addressing him with Your Honour's comment.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, did you hear the question put to you by Mr. Pognon, or do you want him to repeat it for you?
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.  I did understand the question.  If you want me to answer, just tell me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may respond, Witness.
THE WITNESS:
I heard about churches but I never went to visit them and, apparently, people took refuge in some churches and were killed, but those churches were not destroyed.  I can give the example of Kabgaye church.  I never went there, but I heard about it.  I can also speak about Kibuye church, Saint Jean church.  It is clear that people were killed.  However, just as I heard, many people were killed and I even heard that in Kibuye church people were killed, but the church was not demolished, which is not the case for Nyange church.  There were only a few survivors.  I can't be sure 100 per cent.  With regard to the number of people at Nyange, I can say that if the church had not been destroyed, many people would have survived.  I was among the attackers.  Those who tried to flee, we knew about them.  We knew that the next day we would attack them because we gave them supplies.  My brother-in-law and his brothers-in-law asked us, for example, to give them money for supplies.  We gave them supplies.  I have no idea if they were able to cook what we gave them.  Sometimes they went to buy in the restaurants when in hiding.  Crimes were committed.  And we asked for forgiveness.  If the guilty persons are punished that would make it easier to deal with.

Madam President, Your Honours, Mr. Defence Counsel, I am telling you we did evil things; we killed people and we demolished God's church.  If it was possible, those who were not threatened and who can testify should say what they know.  Perhaps the state will not pardon us, but there's still hope that God does so.

	1545H
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel's microphone, please.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Pardon me.  Counsel, do you have many remaining questions?  It is almost time for the break and since the witness is having difficulty --
MR. POGNON:
I have just begun, Madam President.  We can adjourn now.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Perhaps we will adjourn and this will enable the witness to regain his composure.  Very well, we shall adjourn for 15 minutes.
(Court recessed from 1555H to 1615H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are resumed.  Mr. Pognon, you have the floor.
MR. POGNON:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Witness, I hope that you were able to regain your composure.  We are now going to continue.  Witness, we were talking about the day of the 16th.  I want to take your statement, beginning with the end; in other words, the last things you said.  You described, in detail, the demolition of the church.  As the church was being destroyed did you see any of the priests?  While the church was being destroyed did you notice that the priests at the parish at the presbytery came out to watch the destruction?
A.	I thought that I already explained myself on this matter.  I said that except for Father Athanase Seromba, who I saw early in the morning for a brief time -- let me repeat myself.  I saw him briefly in the morning and I did not see him after that and I did not see any other priests on that day of the 16th.
Q.	At what time in the morning, Witness?
A.	I didn't have a watch at that time, but I can give you an estimate.  It was between 7:00 and 8:00 in the morning.
Q.	When did the demolition of the church begin; at what time?
A.	I've already said that they began to destroy the church at around ten o'clock, but, once again, I was not wearing a watch and so it must have been between nine o'clock and ten o'clock in the morning, not before nine o'clock and not after ten o'clock; between 9:00 and ten o'clock.  They first started to shoot at the church, but they were not able to destroy it that way and so they went to look for machinery so they could demolish the church.  I don't want to go back to what I said.  I said that they went to look for equipment which was not there the day before, which was -- which did not stay there overnight.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, you said that -- as the church was being destroyed at around nine o'clock and which finished at about 5 p.m., you said that there was an enormous crowd of people, a suffocating crowd; isn't that correct?
A.	Yes, I said that and I will repeat it.  Here, I'm speaking about attackers, the attackers who were attacking the refugees.  There were many of them.  There were so many that someone who wasn't in good physical condition could have suffocated; let me repeat that.
Q.	Witness, can you tell us approximately how many attackers were there, the many attackers that you describe?
A.	On that day there were many people.  I could count them at 10,000.  There were people who wanted to watch how the machines could destroy the building.  Pieces crumbled down, so much so that they could come down and fall onto a driver, the equipment.  There were other people who were watching the show.  Imagine a tall building -- perhaps you don't know the building or that church was a very solid building.  We couldn't imagine that that building could be destroyed but, in fact, all of those pieces of the building crumbled down into the inside of the church, and I would say that there were approximately 10,000 attackers.  They had surrounded the entire church.  I would ask, and pardon me, that you not come back to that question, Counsel.
Q.	I will not come back, but I am still moving through your testimony.  You said that you remained there and that you only left in the evening after the total destruction of the church.  Now, while the church was being destroyed, could you tell us where the bourgmestre was, where Ndugutse was, and where IPJ, Kayishema, Kanyarukiga and the others were, where exactly were they standing whilst the church was being destroyed?  I wonder: were they there on the spot or had they left?
A.	I cannot ascertain that they were at such-and-such a place, whether they were amongst the attackers or whether they were elsewhere; I cannot state exactly where they were.  The last time I had seen them was in the morning when guns were being fired and when the earthmoving equipment came.  But, afterwards, I wouldn't be able to claim that they were at such-and-such a place because I would be lying.  I saw Ndugutse again at the time when we went back to our cellule, back to our homes.  It's at that point in time that I saw him again, when he was distributing beer.  Normally, when we finished with the killings he would give us beer.  Please, don't ask me where he got the money from, the money that he used; however, I do know that there was one case where he sold three cows belonging to the Tutsi and he collected money with which he bought beer.  Otherwise, he would offer to us cattle taken from the Tutsi.  We would slaughter them and eat the meat.  So, in other words, I wouldn't be able to tell you where those individuals were at that specific moment.
Q.	Thank you, Witness CBR.  You stated -- I'll take that again: can you tell us of the circumstances under which you state you saw Father Seromba on the 15th?
A.	I said, and I repeat, that on the 15th, when there were no more Tutsis alive in the courtyard, we attacked the place where people were sheltered and at that time it's the authorities who were leaving.  They made us break down the door, and at that point in time the father, the priest, came in the company of two gendarmes.  He stopped us from going ahead.  He asked them what they wanted and those in authority said that they wanted to kill the refugees who were in that part.  He told them, first of all, "Take a look; remove that filth."  There were dead bodies; there were bricks.  You'll recall that there had been an exchange of stones thrown, so there was a pile of stones and bricks lying about.  Maybe he, himself, was afraid of spending the night with the corpses there so he wanted us to remove the dead bodies.  Those are the circumstances under which I saw him.  But after he said what he said and after the earthmoving equipment was fetched, I didn't see him again.  So that's how the events occurred.

We were wondering how we were able to get out.  These are things which you may hear of, but for us who experienced these events, it was horrible.  We were wondering how the government was going to govern the country, but within the space of an hour we were able to remove the bodies.  That was the situation, as far as I recall.
Q.	Thank you.  If I understand you correctly, the assailants that you were, had in your minds -- or you were being led by those in authority and you went off with the idea of killing the Tutsis who were at the presbytery.  At that time the priests and the gendarmes stopped you from doing so.  Is that what we should understand from what you've said?
A.	Please remember that they didn't stop us from killing those people because of the pity they had; you should remember that this was a way of reaching the others.  That's what I believe and, furthermore, once that was done we continued with the killings.  If the father had not wanted to kill the people, if that were the case, he would have been able to say something and show that he wanted to do something, but that the people in authority refused.  That was not the case.  From that point in time he could have intervened in a visible manner so that we can see for ourselves that the people in authority refused to listen.  Even today -- even today, one would have said that he intervened, that he did everything in his power.  Really, I didn't see him kill with his own hand, but he didn't do anything.  If he had done anything, maybe one or two people would have survived, had he had the will to do so.

Now, let's imagine that the people in authority refused whatever he may have asked.  He could have fled, himself, and then the refugees would have understood.  There is, for instance, one white man who was working for the Astaldi company.  When he realised the situation was no longer tenable, he left.  Judge Habiyambere, who was nicknamed Gatabucharbutarezi (phonetic) was someone from Rutsiro.  Maybe he could have asked for assistance from him so that at least, later on, it could be said that he tried to intervene on behalf of the refugees.  But he did nothing.
Q.	Thank you.  In your opinion, the parish that was invaded from the 10th -- from the evening of 10th by the refugees, from the 13th or even already as early as the 12th, who came in small groups and whom eventually grew in their numbers -- now, this parish in which seven people -- four priests and three clergymen; that's from the 15th -- do you think that those seven priests, including Father Seromba whom we are speaking about -- were they not in a situation of people who were suffering under occupation?  Outside, there were the assailants and inside there were the refugees.
A.	In truth, let's take that for granted; let's say that's how it was.  Do you mean that that is why he left them like that?  Usually he was a pastor, a shepherd who tends his sheep.  These were sheep which had come to their shepherd, but which were waylaid by wolves; in other words, the assailants who were pursuing them.  Do you think that is logical, in your question, that these attackers looted their property?  I would be very grateful to you if I could have an explanation as to how you understand that, because you are claiming that these people occupied his space and that, possibly, the second group which came, came to take away the land or the belongings of those persons.  You are more learned than I am.  Maybe you can explain your thinking to me.
Q.	Let's now remain with the hypothesis you have used in your response, that of the shepherd and the wolves.  We are looking for clarification.  Please remember that.
A.	I didn't quite get you, Counsel.  What were you up to?
Q.	When you were answering you spoke of the shepherd, which in this case would be Father Seromba, who must defend and protect his flock against the wolves, and I want us to remain with that imagery.  Now, do you think that it was better for Father Seromba and for the other priests, because, in fact, he wasn't the only one -- is it your suggestion that he should have fled and abandoned his church, leaving the refugees locked up in the church, leaving the attackers outside, and that he should flee in the face of such a situation?  Is that your suggestion?
A.	Yes, if he believes that he was not in collaboration with the killers, he should have intervened; he should have made some gesture which today would be engraved in the memory of people.  He could have been able to tell those in authority to stop what they were doing and to not cause any harm to the refugees, instead of continuing to look at these people being killed whilst they were there.  I believe it would have been preferable that they left the scene, instead of continuing to give them false hope that something was going to be done for them.  The persons in authority had gone throughout all the secteurs of the commune, because when people were being killed, they were thrown to the hills and the authorities would come and have those bodies buried.

You will recall that there had been meetings organised prior to this.  There were decisions which had been made during those meetings and these decisions were implemented.  People were exterminated.  If during those meetings they had taken a positive resolution or decision, we would know that now and we would see what they had done.  If at the time I was a politician, I would be able to give you the details today.  But those who were there at the time are not doing so in order to help justice to be carried out.  We were mere citizens.  We took up our machetes and we killed peaceful citizens, but there was a conseiller, for instance, who tried and arrested the killers.  This was on the 8th of April.  He took them to the commune office, but these people here, they didn't even remain in the commune office until the night because they were released.  There was a plan which was implemented by these people who were educated.  I know that it's we, ourselves, who implemented the plan, but it was hatched by the learned and educated people.  I thought that even if your client maintains that he is keeping his secret secret, we know that he was there at the meetings, and it's Ndugutse who told us that.  He was there at those meetings and a decision was made that those people should go -- should be killed, and they were Tutsi.  These were not foreigners who had invaded our territory.  This was what was said and they had started this from 1959.  That's what was being said.

Now, we were wondering how, once again, we were going to suffer under the feudal regime.  Even at the time, let's say this was a modern time where we had vehicles, the leaders would be transported.  There wouldn't be a problem.  But I'm telling you, these people do not want to admit this, and if they were to admit it, it would be good for everyone, both for themselves and for ourselves.  Unfortunately, they are still holding on to the past, the past which goes as far back as 1959 and I believe if that is the case, we will remain in that time.  But, Madam President, Your Honours, we have had enough of this situation.  We, as the ordinary citizens, we have had enough of this situation.
Q.	Thank you for your lengthy intervention, your explanation.
A.	I also wish to thank you.
Q.	You have just said that Ndugutse informed you about the fact that the father attended the meeting.  That's what you've just said, isn't it?
A.	Yes, yes, that's what he told me.  He said that on the 13th, he, himself.
Q.	Now --
A.	Yes, yes, he said that.  I'm talking about Telésphore Ndugutse.
Q.	Yes, I have understood you; I heard you.  Apart from the fact that he told you that, did you actually check that the father went to those meetings, as it's often said in Rwanda?
A.	Well, I didn't have the will or the heart to go and verify all this information.  We just implemented or did what we were told.
Q.	Thank you very much.  If I understand your feelings correctly, you were a peasant and you are blaming the intellectuals for having dragged you into the war; in other words, they abused of your goodness.  Is that correct?
A.	Let's understand one another.  If our good faith had been abused, we would accept that, but I believe that we did what we did because we were told to do so, but I'm not saying that we wouldn't have accepted what they said, because I do admit that these events occurred in those locations, and I repeat this and I will do so 'til the end of my days.  We were given instructions to do what we did.
Q.	In your opinion, in front of the parish which had been invaded by the refugees, and given also the presence of those who were threatening them from outside, what would the occupants of the parish -- in other words, Father Seromba and his colleagues -- what ought they to have done and they failed to do?
A.	I'm sorry; the parish was not invaded.  People had come there to seek refuge at the church.  The church had not been invaded.  I do beg your pardon.  People came there to seek refuge, as was usual.  I think the ancestors of those persons who had come to seek refuge there; their grandfathers, their fathers, and this time around, it was the grandchildren of those earlier people who had come to seek refuge at the same location.  It was a habit.  So, please, don't tell me that the priests' building had come under attack.  People had come there to seek refuge.  I'm repeating that he did nothing.  He did nothing whatsoever, took no action, so that one can see that he made the effort, but that he failed.  So it is up to the Chamber to determine what the rationale should be.
Q.	It would seem that you are continuing in your extrapolations. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The question had already been put in another form and, obviously, he came back to it.  So if you wish, kindly put other questions to the witness.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I am putting this question to the witness so that I can put other questions to him.  He hadn't understood when I said the parish had been invaded; in other words, there were many people.  And he took this negatively, and that's not what I meant.  I say the same thing as yourself: they came there to seek refuge.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Now, let me put to you another question, in order to shed light on events for the Court, because you are saying that it is here and now that light should be shed on events.  At that point in time -- or in the past, when the parishes had been invaded and people had not been killed, their lives had been saved.  Do you know what those priests had done?
A.	Let me tell you, I don't know what measures they took.  I'm not very old.  But I was told stories that people sought refuge at different periods and that they survived.  What I can say is that those priests did what they had to do, but I can't tell you exactly what action they took to spare the lives of those people.  I thought ahead of time that we would be dealing with -- if I knew that we would be dealing with such things, I would have asked before I came here to find out what those priests did, but I didn't ask any such question because I didn't know what was going to come up.
Q.	You were not told that at that time, for one, the attackers respected the church as a place of asylum and, secondly, the priests came to disperse the crowds?  You do not know that?  This is in the history books.
A.	If that is the case, I would agree with you, but personally I'm not informed of this.  But you said something very interesting; you said that the people respected the church.  What is so horrible is that at the time of our events the authorities, themselves, did not respect the church.  The authorities, themselves, had to lead by way of example.  They certainly know history better than I do.  They could have been inspired by that history.  You've just said it, Counsel.
Q.	Since you were on scene, did you not learn that the priests called the authorities, who called the police and brought in the police and who brought in the gendarmes?  You didn't know that, you didn't hear that, Witness?
A.	Yes, the gendarmes were called, but were they called to come and do good things?  We should show the Tribunal what they did.  The police officers showed up, but they fired into the crowd of refugees, just as the gendarmes did.  We should agree on one thing, Counsel: why do you think those gendarmes and police officers were called?  They fired at the refugees.  They were expected to protect them.  What do you expect from an ordinary citizen if that citizen sees gendarmes firing at the refugees, someone who is supposed to protect the refugees?  At one point you see that the refugees are no longer protected and so the attackers also start going after those refugees.  We didn't have modern weapons; the gendarmes did.  If, at the very beginning, the gendarmes began to shoot at the attackers, the attackers would have understood the gendarmes were going to kill them.

Let me tell you, in 1990 in our cellule Ndugutse launched an attack at the home of a Tutsi who was later killed in 1994.  But police officers were not sent to protect the refugee at the parish.  We immediately understood that the authorities could protect the population.  We quickly understood that the authorities could protect the population, and so people were killed in Kibilira, in Bugesera.  The Bagogwe were killed as well.  But when those events began in our commune they brought the communal police officers in, but in 1994 what happened?  The police officers and gendarmes who showed up, who were expected to protect the refugees, themselves, shot at the refugees.  They handed them over to the killers.  So, why do you try to make me understand that they arrived to do good deeds?  Those gendarmes handed the refugees over to the killers.

That is why I'm saying today before this Tribunal that we did what we did in our commune, but if we did it, it is because of our leaders, we were following orders.  And among those leaders I include the father, the priest himself.  During the multiparty system the political parties confronted one another from time to time and when we went to seek refuge we went to the priests' house.  We were in peace and nobody would attack us, but when we left that place, it would all start over again.  What can the authorities say that they tried to do but they were unsuccessful?  What can they say?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So we can move on, Counsel, please put questions to the witness that have not yet been asked.  And, Mr. Witness, please try to answer the questions specifically.  Here, we are running into much repetition in both the questions and answers.
MR. POGNON:
I have one more question in that line, Madam President.

BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Witness, you said that it was possible that the authorities and the priests -- and I say that in plural; there were four of them -- as well as other persons called the authorities to come in to control the situation.  Are you saying they are at fault?  Are you saying that Father Seromba is at fault, at fault because the authorities, including the bourgmestre and the gendarmes, failed in their mission?
A.	Pardon me, Counsel.  You spoke of several priests.  I gave you the names of the priests who were there.  I don't know where they came from.  But the priest I knew who was in charge was Father Seromba.  Moreover, Counsel, this is something he is responsible for.  He asked for people to protect the refugees, but those people killed the refugees.  He has no explanation for that.  If he called people to protect the refugees and those people, in turn, went to the presbytery to protect him, that should be looked into and investigated.
Q.	Thank you.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel's microphone, please.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Let's get back to the day of the 16th of April.  Between seven o'clock and eight o'clock in the morning, you saw Father Seromba.  The authorities were there.  He accompanied the authorities and he stayed at the door -- rather, stood at the door and went inside, and after that you did not see him again.  At about ten o'clock a first attack began on that day, the last day.  Were you able to think that that was a frightful situation, that the people who lived at the presbytery just bunkered down at home?  Did you ever think that they simply became frightful (sic) and locked themselves inside?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I must interrupt you.  You are trying to get the opinions from the witness.  Avoid asking him about his opinion on different things.  He is here simply to ask your questions on factual matters and about what he lived -- or experienced, but you are asking him to give answers to suggestions, or to interpret matters.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I should like to read the statement made by this witness and point out that he makes the suggestions and interprets matters.  On page K0153613 of the document dated 29 August 2000, and in the middle of the second paragraph of the said document I should like to read a passage.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Witness, you said the following: "When the bourgmestre opened fire Father Seromba was standing in front of his presbytery dressed as he was the day before and he was not armed.  After noticing that the attacks launched by the bourgmestre were not sufficiently efficient, the group with the bourgmestre went towards the presbytery to meet with Father Seromba."  Then you list the people who met with Father Seromba.
Earlier, Witness, you said that on the 16th the priest met with the authorities and he left the presbytery.  This was between seven o'clock and eight o'clock.  I have written down everything you said, Witness.  You said that the attack began at around ten o'clock.  You no longer saw Seromba after that.  At which point in time, therefore, did you see him standing in front the presbytery?  Isn't there a contradiction between what you said in your statement to the Prosecutor and your repeated testimony during this cross-examination?  How do you explain that contradiction, Witness?
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Madam President, Your Honours, I would like to say that counsel is distorting what I said.  I said that the first attack was the one launched by the bourgmestre who fired at the refugees and he started doing that right after he left the presbytery, and that's what I said.  When it turned out that that attack was not working, when it was taking too long, they decided to bring in heavy equipment.  When the equipment arrived they used it to destroy the church.  What was said was said before they fired at the people.  They started to fire at the people after they met one another.  I don't know what they said to one another.  That is what I said, and I'm repeating it now; otherwise, you are simply distorting what I said, Counsel.
Q.	Thank you.  You said, and I think you would agree, they met and spoke in the morning; you don't know what they said to one another but, after their discussion, the bourgmestre fired into the air; he fired a gun.  Must we believe that that was the only time, and this is still with regard to the 16th of April -- it was the only time that you saw Father Seromba?
A.	No, you are not telling the truth.  I told you that I saw Father Seromba twice: I saw him on the 15th and on the 16th.  I saw him once on the 15th, and on the 16th I saw him once.
Q.	Thank you.
A.	I did not say that I saw him only once.
Q.	I am dealing with the 16th, not the 15th.  We agree that you saw him only once.
A.	Yes, I agree.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, can you explain for us what is written down here, which was written down by the investigators?  Let me read the sentence from earlier.  Pardon me, let me go more slowly.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you have already read that passage.  Perhaps you could just go to the next passage.
MR. POGNON:
Yes, I wanted to read slowly.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you should go slowly but, since you have already read that passage, perhaps you should move on to the next passage instead of repeating it entirely.
MR. POGNON:
It's because it's a continued passage.  I simply wanted to give the context of the action as described by the witness.  With your leave, Madam President, I should like to read the passage: "After realising that the bourgmestre-type attack was not very effective, the group went to the parish house to confer with Father Seromba.  I saw the following persons meeting at the parish house with Father Seromba: Ndahimana, Muraginabugabo, Kayishema, Ndugutse, Habarugira, Kanyarukiga and Habiyambere".

Witness, explain this assertion which contradicts your testimony, repeated testimony, that you only saw Father Seromba once.  Here you are saying you saw people meet him, and you even name the people who met with him.
A.	Perhaps the investigators or the translators made a mistake.  I only know one language -- on the 15th.
Q.	Please, let's deal with the 16th, not the 15th.  We are still dealing with the 16th.  Otherwise, you're going to get into a long discussion and then I'm going to be reprimand by the Tribunal.  Let's deal with the 16th.  Let's deal with the 16th, Witness.  So, must I understand that the investigators distorted what you said and we will leave it at that, Witness?
A.	Pardon me.  Let me first answer the question that you put to me.  On the 16th those people went to the presbytery before shooting.  They started shooting when they returned from there.  They were not able to go back to the presbytery, or at least I didn't see it.
Q.	So what is put down here, in black and white, is inconsistent with what you said, Witness?
A.	I don't know how to read that language.  Let me repeat what I said.  I said that on the 16th when I arrived the people, as well as the people you have named, went to the presbytery and upon their return they started shooting.  Those authorities started shooting.  Now, it turned out that they could not fulfil their mission so they resorted to their equipment.  That was my testimony, and I will repeat it.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Let me continue with your statement, still with regard to the 16th of April.  I'm still speaking about your statement of the 29 August 2000, on the same page.  And now, I'm on the same page, K0153613 in the French version.  Just below the middle of that page, the sentence begins as follows: "After the entire church had collapsed the authorities held a meeting with Father Seromba, after which I heard him ordering the removal of the rubbish in front of his house" -- by "rubbish", he meant the bodies of the refugees -- "after the entire church had collapsed -- after everything had collapsed."  Witness, did you say this: did you say that you saw Father Seromba say those things after the church had been destroyed?
A.	I never saw him.
Q.	Thank you.  Thank you, Witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Allow the witness to finish his response, Counsel.
MR. POGNON:
I'm the one asking the questions.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But you did put the question to him.  Yes, this is of interest to the Tribunal, but you must let the witness finish his response.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.  With regard to the question that the counsel just asked me, let me say that on the morning of the 16th, I saw the priest.  I did not see him again that evening.  When the church had collapsed, I went home.  Now, with regard to picking up the "rubbish", he said that on the 15th.  He said that the "rubbish" had to be removed on the 15th.  Where the church was, there were refugees.  The bricks were on top of the victims.  This was not in front of his house.  So as regards the "rubbish", reference was made to that on the 15th.  He said that the "rubbish" had to be removed on the 15th.  I never said that he never said these things.  He did say them, but he said them on the 15th.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Thank you.  Now, with regard to that assertion you make, the people who took down your statement said something that, in fact, you have never said.
A.	If that's the case, that's not my problem.  I even said that the meeting took place on the 15th.  There was no meeting on the 16th, except that the people went to the presbytery or the parish house.  That's all I have to say, thank you.  Perhaps the investigator mixed up things, but if he did so, that's not my fault.
Q.	Thank you.  That said, you mentioned, Witness, that you don't know how to read; is that correct?
A.	No, I was talking about other languages.  I know how to read Kinyarwanda.
Q.	When we received your statements on Tuesday, 29th August 2000 -- when those were taken down, rather, was the statement read back to you to make sure that you said such-and-such-and-such a thing and that you signed the statement?  Did they read back what they took down, or did they take the statement in Kinyarwanda and give it back to you so that you could read it yourself to agree that it was faithful to what you had said, and did all of this happen before you were asked to sign the statement?
A.	Let me tell you, the statement was read back to me.  But the statement was taken down in the language that I do not understand.  There was an interpreter present.  Now, with regard to those dates, there must be a mix-up.  The prosecutor who questioned me is here with us.  He can repeat what I said.  The investigators mixed up the dates of the 15th and 16th, perhaps.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel's microphone, please.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	So you are blaming this on the persons who took down your statements, you are blaming them for the mix-up, are you?  Well, that will be taken into consideration by the Tribunal.  Now, I would like to refer you -- before we go to the record of the interview, I would like to refer you to the matter of the little presents that you were offered after the attacks.  You said that you were in your cellule at Ndugutse's home and he offered you beer.  He offered you beer, and you stated that there was occasion even when cattle were slaughtered and meat was eaten.  You said that you refreshed yourselves with that after your job.  You also confirmed that after the destruction of the church, once you went back to your cellule, Ndugutse offered you beer.  Can you please say exactly whether this happened at a bar or whether it was at a home, I mean the place where beer was offered?
A.	He offered us the beer in a bar.
Q.	To whom was the beer offered?  And I'm saying this because the attackers were many in number.  Now, these refreshments, was it done for you in small groups or was it agreed that once the job was done you would go to drink?  I'm wanting to find out what was the norm after you finished your job: would you go into a bar in order to drink after the attacks were over for the day?
A.	Yes, that was normal when we came back from the attacks.  Ndugutse would buy beer for us in the evenings.  He would have us gather in CARITAS bar.  But it was a small group from the cellule; it wasn't all the attackers that were involved.
Q.	Thank you.  Can you repeat the name of the bar, please?
A.	It was a bar known as CARITAS.
Q.	Now I want to go to the last page of your statement, the statement you made on the 29th of August 2000, the same statement.  I'm at the last sentence, and you say the following: "I never saw Father Seromba attend our meetings.  There we would listen to Ndugutse indoctrinate us by repeating what he claimed to have heard at other meetings with the authorities, that the Inyenzi were hiding weapons everywhere within certain families in their plan to eliminate us."  Do you recognise those words as having been said by you?
A.	Yes, I agree, but I state that this was at our meetings with Ndugutse; in other words, in our cellule.  I never saw Father Seromba in our cellule.  I only saw Ndugutse who was telling us what had been said at the meetings.  I did not attend the meetings held by the authorities.
Q.	Where is Ndugutse now?
A.	I don't know.
Q.	Is it because he is nowhere to be seen that he is being blamed for everything now?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you really want him to ask him that now?
MR. POGNON:
There are, sometimes, questions which are more important than the answers, Madam President, and I think this is one of them.
THE WITNESS:
It's not because he is not there.  Ndugutse is known to one and all.  Everybody knows what he did.  Even a small child, a child, who was at the time learning how to speak, can tell you.  There are many people who are absent who are no longer there, but we do not blame them.  Why am I not talking about Kayishema, whereas, he is the one who would come and give instructions to us?  Kayishema would come to ask us to help him.  Ndugutse was well known.  He liked the Tutsis -- he hated the Tutsis.  He didn't even bear the notion of a cow belonging to a Tutsi coming to his field.  He had built a path so that he wouldn't pass through in Ndakubana's home because he hated him for merely being Tutsi.  It's not merely because he is absent.  He was known.  Everybody from ******** commune will say something about Ndugutse.  This should be noted, and if you ever find anyone from ***********, a native of *******, ask that person questions, and if you don't get the same answer, maybe then you will know that I am possibly lying.
Q.	Let's dwell a bit on this Ndugutse.  You said -- you said that he was the one who came to indoctrinate you at meetings that you had with him.  What were those meetings that you held with him?
A.	We were being indoctrinated about killing Tutsis.  After the death of the president, he would indoctrinate us; he would encourage us to kill Tutsi.  When the killings stopped, when the bourgmestre announced that Tutsis should no longer be killed, Ndugutse had all the Tutsi in the cellule killed.  Ndugutse hated Tutsi.  He had a visceral hatred for Tutsi.  He didn't hold any meetings.  It was only the meeting aimed at the idea of having the Tutsis killed.  Let me also tell you that some secteurs would have recourse to him, would depend on him.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, do you have any further questions for this witness?
MR. POGNON:
Yes, I still do have questions.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Because, here, we have already gone beyond the allotted time for the hearing and we are going to have to adjourn.  How much more time would you need with this witness?
MR. POGNON:
I beg your pardon.  What did you say?  Maybe an hour and a half.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
One hour and a half?  Very well.

So, Witness, you will return to this courtroom on Monday and the cross-examination will continue, and, possibly, re-examination by the Prosecution.  We will see when the time comes.  We will also hear the third witness on Monday.

Very well.  I thank you one and all.  Have a good evening.

The session stands adjourned.
