MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. 

Registry, would you be so kind as to read out what we'll be doing this morning?
MR. FRY:
Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Vaz, presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Friday, 22 October 2004, for the status conference in the matter of the Prosecutor vs. Seromba, Case Number ICTR-2001-66-T.  Thank you, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We'd like to thank the registry.  

So we are here for a status conference.  We have concluded the first session, and we have heard most of the Prosecution witnesses.  I think there are a few more to give testimony.  We shall, therefore, give the floor first to the Prosecutor so that she can tell us how many witnesses she still intends to call and about how much time she will require.  And, of course, afterwards we shall call on both parties to present or to submit any matters that they wish to have discussed here before we break up.

Madam Prosecutor, you have the floor.
MS. ARBIA:
Thank you, Madam President.  Your Honours, good morning.  

For the Prosecution, there are only four witnesses left to be called, including three detainees.  Regarding the duration of examination-in-chief, we can estimate -- we might say that we need about half a day for each witness.  As for the cross-examination, I would be glad if the Defence would give us some information so that we also will be better able to organise the appearance of witnesses and everything concerning the hearing of these witnesses.  That is what I have to say in respect of the witnesses.  I have no further details at this time.  

For the three detained witnesses or witnesses under detention, the Prosecutor wishes to -- will ask for -- to tender an oral motion as soon as possible for the extension of the time limit for the transfer of these witnesses to Arusha.  As for the other witness who is not under detention, he has, as of now, confirmed that he will be available to return for the next session.  We do not know exactly when, but he was generally available to come and give testimony here.  We shall do everything possible, as has been done for the other witnesses, so that we shall try to limit and facilitate discussions, and we shall also try our best to limit the examination-in-chief.  That is, in brief, what we have to say.  
If you wish, Madam President, I may now make my remarks on other issues.  If you consider that I should do them later, then perhaps you might be so kind as to indicate.  This is in regard to certain motions that are still pending.  I do not know whether we are going to talk about this during this status conference.  I am in your hands, Madam President.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor.  

Defence, who shall be speaking on behalf of the Defence?  Counsel Pognon, you have the floor.
MR. POGNON:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  

We have taken note of what the Prosecutor has said, that at the end of this first session, she has four witnesses left, including three under detention.  With the requirements governing the calling of these witnesses to the bar, we also note that the Prosecutor has stated that for these witnesses, the examination-in-chief should take half a day.  

I see that there is a correction in regard to the examination of CBY.  The programme that she gave us provided for one day for this witness, so the Prosecutor has amended her projected duration of the examination-in-chief for CBY.  

Regarding the estimates that the Prosecutor wishes us to give for the cross-examination, I think it's a bit difficult.  We have realised that the Prosecutor is often quite fast in her examinations-in-chief, but given the charges against the Accused -- and though the examination-in-chief is brief, it touches on all the charges, that is, all the counts -- the Defence has been obliged on each occasion to cover all counts in the indictment, and so the Defence is forced to take more time, in view of the detail that arises from every statement that comes from the witness, however brief it is.  

So we cannot say that, as the Prosecutor -- like the Prosecutor, cross-examinations for these witnesses will not take too much time.  Depending on what the witness says, the average time we have taken for cross-examinations is one day or one day and a half, if possible, so it is within that framework or time frame that we can work to address this issue.  

In regard to pending motions, this is a status conference.  Motions are decisions, Court decisions, even though they are subject to certain conditions and even though they affect the continuation of trial.  I do not think that we are here to raise motions here.  We have not taken any measures to plead these motions.  There will be submissions.  There will be the Tribunal's position.  There will be our position.  So what we are here to do is actually to reschedule the future programme so we will -- we should take or schedule a hearing so that these motions can be raised before the Tribunal, based on our submissions.  That is what I can say about these motions, because this is a status conference.  We are not even in official vestments of the court.  That is what I can say for the time being in response of -- in response to the Prosecutor's remarks. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor. 
MS. ARBIA:
Very briefly, Madam President.  I did not wish to raise the motions here.  I just wished to ask the Trial Chamber whether -- whether we should assess the progress made in regard to motions.  There is one that is very important for the Prosecution.  The Prosecution has only four witnesses and is coming to the end of our evidence.  

So I will -- there is a motion regarding judicial notice, and I think that it is in the interest of the parties to obtain a decision so that we can conclude the procedure in regard to this motion.  It was just to give an assessment of progress made in terms of motions and not to plead them at this time.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor.  

So you have the heard the response of the Prosecutor regarding motions.  She just wanted us to evaluate the progress.  For our part, we are working on the motions.  We think that we should be able to render a decision in the near future.  I do not think that it is necessary to provide for a hearing for pleadings since both parties answered by -- in writing.  

However, there is just one exception regarding this motion for judicial notice that the Prosecutor has mentioned.  This motion is in English.  I do not know whether you can respond to this motion.  It was filed -- or it has been sent up for translation into French, but so far we have not yet obtained this translation.  Perhaps Counsel Pognon can tell us something regarding this motion for judicial notice filed by the Prosecutor. 
MR. POGNON:
Thank you, Madam President.  Regarding this motion, I think that it is still in its original form, that is, in English, and we are yet to receive a translation of it.  If we had received it, perhaps we might have responded to the motion, because this concerns judicial notice.  The points at issue, which might be raised, could be minimal in our view, and I think that part of the motion is in question-and-answer form with little squares where one is indicated to -- little crosses where it is expected to either place a tick or a cross or yes or no.  We still have it in the English version.  We are hoping to receive it in its French version, so that there will be no misunderstanding.  That is my view, Madam President.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Pognon.  We are asking the language section to do its best so that this document is translated into French so that the Defence can respond quickly and thus enable us to render a decision.  

As to the other motions, I have mentioned to you that between now and the 10th of November at the very latest we should have taken our decisions. 

Now, regarding the remark by the Prosecutor regarding -- concerning detained witnesses, for the time being, our brief covers up to the end of the month.   
MS. ARBIA:
That is correct, yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So afterwards you may raise a written motion or you may file a written motion, and we shall receive a decision to this end.  

I have been given to understand that the Defence has already conducted some investigations.  You have been able to establish contact with the service that is in charge of witnesses.  Do you have any information to give us about the progress that has been made in terms of investigations? 
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, from this viewpoint, we have not yet been able to obtain the final agreement.  We have not yet finalised all our witnesses or the availability of all our witness, considering that some things were said, some facts were recounted, which means that while we have a list of witnesses that we shall submit to the WVSS, we still consider that we shall include other new witnesses on our list, and from that viewpoint, we have several missions to carry out.  

There's one that has already been started or made to Europe, and I think that I, myself, will be involved in other missions.  We shall continue our effort.  Another mission -- yet another mission will go to another location consequently, and I should add here that one of the missions will be with our investigator and Counsel Monthé himself.  The second mission will be our legal assistant, who shall go elsewhere.

So we are doing everything in our power to spread our forces with a view to being ready, so that we should be ready in December, or at the end of December at the very latest, and we shall then send a list of witnesses, our final list of witnesses, to WVSS.

So this is our current status for the Defence.  The situation is fairly difficult.  We -- this is our entire team, and we're doing the best we can.  Considering that since the people who are going out on missions, field missions for us, are generally refugees, Rwandese refugees or Rwanda refugees who know their own people, sometimes they have a lot of difficulty in finding visas.  The last time we had to intervene several times to enable our investigator to have a visa for Cameroon from Kenya, where he lives, so we have all these difficulties.  We are in contact with WVSS.  We asked them to support us so that everything should be done.  But Defence has not been able to obtain all the facilities that are available to the Prosecutor, and that is why, for the time being, we are in this position.  We shall inform the Court, therefore, and the Prosecutor in due course regarding this matter, and we shall inform WVSS.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Pognon.  Can you not tell us just about how much -- how many witnesses you intend to call? 
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, we have a situation where there are still four Prosecution witnesses to be called.  We expect that since there was a crowd in this place where the events took place, we expect 30 or 40 witnesses.

1030H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Perhaps now we might consider the date of the next session.  We would like to know when the parties will be ready so that we shall hear the testimony of the four Prosecution witnesses that are left.

I think that the Prosecution is always here, and so are the judges, so I think this question is more targeted towards the Defence.  

Counsel Pognon or Counsel Monthé, perhaps you might enlighten us as to when you might be available for continuation of trial. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, Madam President.  Madam President, Your Honours, we have already raised the problems with you.  We are in a difficult situation in view of the sort of trial that we have in this Court and also in view of our respective working programmes.  

In my particular case, I have particular family issues that I cannot avoid facing, whatever I do, which means that November is going to require my presence with my family.  December will also mean that I have to be in my village and in my area, and it is a very significant ceremony that I have to attend, so I was thinking that it would be best for us to come here in January, because since we have already provided for, or planned, several missions with our investigators, as Counsel Pognon was telling you, it will therefore be impossible for us to be here before January.  To be able to make a serious case before you, Counsel Pognon and I thought that if we could come here on the last week of January, it would be perfectly good for us because we will have resolved all pending issues.  

I see the Judge shaking his head, but unfortunately, Your Honour, to leave Douala to Arusha is particularly difficult, in spite of the facilities of air travel.  You have one day to spend in Nairobi.  It's not very pleasant.  And what is more, we should also comply with or respect the terms of contracts that we have signed with our clients back home.  When you spend a month and a half here, you have matrimonial problems, you have all sorts of other problems, so one needs to go home and stay there a little.  So we think that we need these two short months to prepare our coming here again.  Madam President, this is what we can tell you as seriously, as honestly and as conscientiously as possible.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Pognon. 

MR. POGNON:
I think that Counsel Monthé has expressed the concerns of the Defence and has raised both professional and family reasons, and for the family reasons, these are imperative because the funeral ceremonies of a father are a very important part of our cultures.  

In my case, I said that from the 26th, I shall have to be at the Court of Appeal in Togo, and in November and December, apart from the fact that I shall be with my friend, Counsel Monthé, for a few days and then leave him with his family, these are very important months.  I have to resolve certain pending issues in my practice.  We are working on cases that have been tabled before the International Chamber of Commerce, so I require the month of December to reduce the workload in my practice, and this is also the month that I shall have to seek witnesses and perfect my selection of my final list of witnesses, so we need this time.  It is not time for rest; it is time of intense activity on all fronts so that we may be able to return here prepared.  

So the date that has been indicated seems to be a deadline of sorts, and it should be considered that, given our willingness or availability, this date can only -- we can only be available after the date that we have indicated to you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Pognon.  

Madam Prosecutor. 
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, Your Honours, I am not going to go over the history of this trial, but I recall that during a status conference in January 2004, Counsel Pognon had said he was prepared to commence the trial, so he knew that he was going to be committed in this trial.  Now we have had a very short session.  We haven't even been able to finish the examination-in-chief of the Prosecution, so I think the reasons that were put forward by the Defence are not very convincing.  

These are two counsels, and I think there should be a minimum effort or organisation between the two of them, because if they did so and shared their tasks, things would be better.  And I think also as concerns the problems we have had during this session, we should try and catch up with time and conclude the leading in evidence of the Prosecution as early as possible.  I think, in any case, January is already far off, in the opinion of the Prosecutor.  The Prosecutor also has many problems insofar as its internal organisation with respect to the trial is concerned but, of course, we do this -- it faces difficulties, so difficulties of problems are faced by all the parties, but we do the best we can.  I think that on our side, we should expect the same thing from the other party, especially insofar as the conclusion of the evidence of the Prosecution is concerned, so things will be a bit more difficult for us.  Everything will be complicated, so in the general interest, we know that we have a trial that is under way and we need to conclude the Prosecution examination.  So the task for the Prosecutor is also difficulties, so things shouldn't be complicated.  

What we are asking is that we try to conclude the examination of the witnesses of the Prosecution before January.  It is true that this session could have taken more time than it has, but for various reasons, unfortunately, the Prosecution could not conclude presenting its evidence.  I'm asking the Chamber now if the needs of the Prosecution can be considered, given the general requirements of the Tribunal in general, especially as concerns witnesses, as concerns detained witnesses, and other problems that have to do with the judicial calendar.  So, for us, this is also going to be a difficult period.  

As the Prosecution team for this current trial, the Prosecution's interest is to conclude its presentation of evidence as early as possible, so I think you should take this request of the Prosecution into consideration.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, the status conference is, by definition, is not the case to raise controversies.  I think that we really want to say this as solemnly and firmly as possible.  You can be fair to us, Madam President, by realising that we have been here for one month in Arusha.  

Secondly, we did not take the Tribunal by surprise.  We had already announced our agenda at the very beginning.  The Prosecutor has said on several occasions, and Madam President, I'm going to bring -- I'm going to refer to four different persons, or, rather, the Prosecution has presented four different persons: Madam Althea, Madam (sic) Townsend, Mr. Moses and the others.  There are only four of us here and we have not been absent in any hearing, except in the circumstances that you are aware of, so we are very loyal.  And that is one thing that should be considered.

The second thing, Madam President, is that the Seromba case is of interest to all of us and we are very attached to it given the status of the Accused.  We have many clients.  We have a professional responsibility.  It is not to you that I will be telling this, you who are very experienced judges.  I think you should appreciate this, but if you give us a date that is not convenient for us, we will have even more difficulties because we will say that we won't be able to be there.  We have already said this on several occasions, Madam President, to your, yourself, to your judges, in our chambers.  We don't see how we can say things differently here.  

Now, if you want to force things in order to conclude this trial, well, it will be up to you to determine.  As far as we are concerned, we have our colleagues of the other Chamber's hearings have been adjourned.  Others will be resuming on the 15th January.  Others have been here only for one month.  I don't know what you want to impose on us.  It's an objective problem.  

So, Madam President, we are imploring you because we feel that it would not be possible to insist that we are here before January.  That is what I wanted to say.  Our agendas, our calendars will not enable us to be here before then.  

Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This is what we are going to propose to you, that we set the date for the next session on the 19th of January, but we are going to ask the Defence to start presenting its evidence as soon as we would have concluded with the Prosecution witnesses.  

Counsel Pognon. 
MR. POGNON:
I believe that once the Prosecution evidence would have been presented, we should have a time limit within which to prepare our motions on what will ensue from the evidence of the Prosecution.  This is what is provided for here, so we should have a time frame within which to prepare such motions.  Obviously, while we will be doing that, we will get in touch or we will provide the Prosecution with our witness list.  I will take the measures for disclosures that are required.

The Defence has always been given a time frame once the Prosecution has concluded presentation of its evidence, and that date, therefore -- I don't know when, on what date the Prosecution will conclude its evidence, that is, after 19th of January.  We should at least be given the required -- the time necessary.  

Secondly, there is also the WVSS that we contacted that have told us that they need a time limit of two months from the end of December for the Defence witnesses to be available, so these are imperatives that are well beyond our control.  So we have to approach the witnesses, we go before the witnesses, we have them tell us how available they are to come and witness, and most of them are exiled persons, they are refugees, and the Prosecution knows how to go about it to tell us that they will need a time limit of two months -- or rather, the WVSS knows why they require a time limit of two months, so we cannot start presenting our -- we can't be able to present our evidence immediately after the conclusion of the presentation of the Prosecution evidence, and I think we usually require some time and I think this is what is customary, and that is what I can say insofar as that problem is concerned.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think you are right when you say that after presentation of the Prosecution evidence, the custom is to grant time, some period to the Defence before it begins the presentation of its own evidence.  We are in a rather particular situation where we thought we were going to conclude presentation of evidence of the Prosecution during this session.  Unfortunately, we couldn't do so for various reasons, so we still have those four witnesses.  

What I'm asking you, therefore, is merely to try to shorten the time frames that are generally granted to the Defence by taking advantage of this more or less three months, because we have the time between today and the next session, so we should use the time in between to do as much as we can so that we can hear the Defence evidence as early as possible after conclusion of the presentation of Prosecution evidence, so I don't know how -- about how much time would you need after we have heard the four Prosecution witnesses, because we are beginning on the 19th, and I think by the next 
-- the week following, the week of the 19th, we would have concluded the presentation of the Prosecution evidence, so how much time do you need to file your motions, taking into account the 
-- on the basis of the Prosecution evidence before you begin presentation of your own evidence?
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, we have already said we are going to do all we can to be pleasant to your Chamber and in order to make sure that we make progress, but it so happens that -- well, for instance, I will be leaving tomorrow and we will be going with many kilos of documents.  We have to be prepared.  I think we will come back on the 19th, probably you will need three days for the cross-examinations, and we will have to prepare the motion.  All of this requires time, and because, unfortunately, we work with our minds, and just like you, the mind can work well only when it's well rested, so there are imperatives that we can't control.  

We feel that you can foresee we are going to try to shorten the time, but we have already said that you should make room for, say, about one month for us to file a motion, depending on the number of witnesses that the Prosecution would have called.  I don't think, however, that it would be reasonable for your Chamber for us to promise something that we cannot deliver, and that is why we have always felt that it is necessary to tell the truth.  We are well aware of your deadlines and your time limits.  We are going to take that into account, but we can't work faster than we can.  

Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.

Very good.  After hearing the parties, the Chamber sets the date for the next session for the 19th of January.  We will invite the Defence to make the necessary effort to reduce the time limit of one month to about three weeks for presentation of evidence.  We will also ask them to see how they, themselves, can reduce the number of witnesses that they want to call, because they are telling us they will call between 30 and 40 witnesses, and I think that number is rather high.  If you reduced the number, I think this will help us shorten the time devoted to the sessions for the presentation of Defence evidence.

If there are any other speakers, we are ready to listen to you.  

Yes, Madam Prosecutor.
MS. ARBIA:
Thank you, Madam President.  If I understood you well, concerning the three weeks with effect from the conclusion of the Prosecution evidence, I would like to have indications on the procedure concerning presentation of the Defence evidence.  If we can calculate, say, from 19 January, and we will count some ten days for conclusion of evidence, and then three weeks for the Defence.  

I think what is interesting for us is also that we should try to set deadlines or time limits insofar as filing of pre-defence briefs are concerned, and I think this will be under Rule 73 ter.  To the best of my knowledge, the Defence has not yet filed any application with respect to protection, so it will depend on the time limits as set by the Chamber for the disclosures of witnesses, non-redacted witnesses, witness statements, and other statements, but so far we don't have any basis for setting an effective date for commencement or beginning of the presentation of the Defence evidence, so I must point out that insofar as the Defence is concerned, there has been some delay because they haven't made an application for the protection of its witnesses, and this can be done independent of the final list of witnesses, and I'm saying this in order that we expedite the procedure.  At least I think we should be in a position to know the date -- we need to have that information for the Chamber to determine the deadline for making disclosures, and I think this will not only expedite the procedures, but it will also make it possible to foresee the delays or the time limit that the Defence will need.  And especially insofar as disclosing the identity of witnesses, it's very important because this will also enable the Prosecution to prepare its own cross-examination.  

Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor.  

Yes, Counsel Monthé. 

MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I simply want to tell your Chamber that I had thought we had agreed that you had announced the 19th of January and you are asking us to make an effort, you are urging us to shorten the time limit.  We understood this well and we are confirming this to you.  We don't want to raise any -- to start any polemics this morning.  We have had a very difficult month here, and I want to go back to my home town, you know, with a clear conscience.  We will do the best we can.  I only want to tell the Prosecutor that we cannot protect people that we do not know.  I think we need to come up with a list.  We need to have people who have accepted to come and that we have scheduled them before we ask for their protection.  We will do this, and I think nobody should lose sight of this.  We are the ones who are defending the person who is accused here, and we want to do this, and we definitely want to do this as fast as possible.  We are going to draw up our program.  We are not tourists; we are going to use our time usefully, but if you want us to come here and not do useful work, we will come, and I will go and spend time at the Serengeti park, but I want to come here and do useful work, and that is why we are giving the time limits that we are asking for.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, the Chamber has taken note of the measures that will be taken by the Defence, and any decision that we will take concerning the protection of witnesses, that is, of Defence witnesses, we will say the time limit within which unredacted statements should be disclosed.  I think this will be taken into account bearing in mind what has been said here such that, as you said, we can make provision so that we can hold useful hearings which should make us make progress and so that we don't waste time on issues of the disclosures, et cetera.  

So, in the absence of the any other questions, I think that we can adjourn this session.

Any other questions, no?
MS. ARBIA:
No, Madam President, except as concerns the protection order.  I do not know if this is within your discretion, but I think you have to set a time limit for filing so that you can take a useful decision if we want to stay within the time frame that you have set, but I think this is -- you know, within your discretion to so determine. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are going to invite the Defence, before we rise, to file the application for the protection of witnesses as soon as possible.  If the list is varied in due course, that will not be material, but you already should be applying for protection measures so that the WVSS can take the necessary steps.  This also is also important for the protection of the witnesses, because they will have time to do all that they need to ensure their protection, so the earlier you start the procedure, the better.  

So we would like to thank all of you.  The proceedings stand adjourned.  

We would like to wish you a pleasant return trip home, and we wish you very happy festivities for the end of this year, so thank you, and see you.
