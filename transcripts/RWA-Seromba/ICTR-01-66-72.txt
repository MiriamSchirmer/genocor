MADAM PRESIDENT:
The court is called to order.  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  Counsel Monthé, this morning it's indeed the Accused who is supposed to testify.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  
Madam President, Defence regretfully submits that this morning the Accused Seromba cannot testify because Defence had already objected to that ruling.  In fact, it has a motion which it is prepared to argue before you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Counsel Monthé.  	
MR. MONTHÉ:
Obliged, Madam President.  Madam President, this morning, Defence has the feeling of big sadness.  The Defence is worried, and that is why it refers or raises arguments of the law, and it wants to the law to be upheld.  And that is the reason we have seized your Court with a motion entitled, "Extremely urgent motion for the purpose of reconsidering the decision of 21 April 2006, in respect of the appearance of the Accused as witness, and we will rely on the provisions of Rules 85(C) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence and Article 20 of the Statute of the Tribunal."  The operated part of this motion is drafted as follows -- I would want to read it out to your Court before I elaborate, considering the position of Rule 85 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence together with Article 20 of the Statute of the Tribunal, the Defence of Father Seromba will seek or request the Chamber the Chamber to reconsider this ruling of 26th of April 2006 with respect to the appearance of Father Seromba as witness, and grants the request that he appear as a witness last after the appearance of all the witnesses, including  that of Witness PS2, which will be heard through a video link, do direct, consequently, that 
Father Seromba will be heard as witness in his own Defence under circumstances that he seeks mainly; after the testimony of all the witnesses, and more specifically on Tuesday, April 2006."

Madam President, Your Honours, why are we here?  We are here because a man stands accused, and the feeling among those who defend him is that he is being falsely accused.  Now, dealing with history, which we will be challenging in this respect, we cannot set aside what we consider as, obviously, a flagrant violation of the rights of the Defence, and that is why we have come here this morning, convinced that we can stand by the sovereign law.  And in that regard, we rely on instruments and precedents that have been set which we will elaborate before you.  Today that I argue before you, we have to bear in mind what St. Exupéry said, when he said that being a man is being a responsible person, and I do really bear that responsibility that weighs on my shoulders.  Madam President, 
Your Honours, the Defence does not understand why we are in the final stage of this case, and we have kind of a mystical date, namely; the 27th of April when all must come to an end.  I would like to point out to the Court that Rule 85 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence does provide that the accused has a right to appear as a witness in his own Defence, and that rule does not determine the circumstances under which the said witness should appear.  You did Rule, while we did not agree, Madam President that you intended to have Father Seromba here present appear this morning, and I told you that that would not be reasonable, and it would not be possible.  You deemed it necessary to set, through the video link, the hearing of Witness PS2 on the 26th and 27th of April 2006.  That decision, Madam President, Your Honours, in violation of the desires of the Accused here, who all the same, is the person under trial, and who has to pay the price of your decision, and that is at variance with the practice as it applies in this matter.  And let me provide the evidence in that regard.  The first one, in terms of the instruments, lies on the provisions of Article 20 of the statutes of this Tribunal and to be sure that I am not mistaken, I am going to read it out.

I was saying that so as not to be mistaken, I am going to read it -- Article 20 of the Statute of this Tribunal upholds the rights of the Accused.  Paragraph one says. "All persons shall be equal before the International Tribunal for Rwanda."  4(G) says, in respect of the Accused - says: "Not to be compelled to testify against herself or herself, or to confess quilt."  That is the situation in which your Chamber is compelling Father Athanase Seromba to testify against his own will today.  This is not in conformity with the applicable law, and specifically, the provision of Article 20, which I have just read. 

Madam President, what I am saying, doesn't seem to be of any concern or of interest to the Court.  Maybe I should stop.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That is your business, Counsel, as far as we are concerned, we do have the right to consult each other. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you for that clarification.  I will continue with my submission, which is warranted this morning.  

Madam President, a couple consideration of jurisprudence requires that we look through important judgments handed down by the ICTY.  The first one is the Delalic trial, where the Prosecutor sought from the Court, that the Accused appears as witness prior to the appearance of all other witnesses, that decision rendered in April 1999; and this was the answer of the court, given the request of the Prosecutor.  It is in English.   I will read it out in English.  That is the part of concern to us.  Quote:  The Accused have the right to choose whether to appear as witness in his own Defence or not, and this right is not respected to a particular stage of his Defence, unquote.  And the Judges went on to explain that the Defence can sustain that right, including after the evidence of all the witnesses for the Defence.  That is the ruling in Delalic trial.  In more striking manner, ICTY, in the Prosecutor vs. Dario Kodic and Mario Cerkez, which decision was rendered on the 19th of March 1999, said as follows, and it is the judges that are rendering their ruling, and let me read it:  "Considering the argument of the Defence according to which the Accused had been fully aware to testify -- to choose to testify when he wants to do so, considering, that apart from the fact that Article 21(4G) of the statute does protect the Accused person against being compelled to testify, no provision states in all the Rules indicate that at this stage of the proceedings that such accused will be required to testify.  It has been understood, however, that it is the practice within the International Tribunal to testify and to choose at what point in time they will do so."

More recently, this matter arose in what is considered here Butare trial, where in one of the Accused, Arsene Shalom Ntahobali, who was in a hurry to testify under the same circumstances was disputing that, and this gave rise to a motion for the disqualification of the Bench of that Chamber.  It needed the consent of the later, the Accused, so that serenity can be restored.  And, we are asking respectfully, so that because there is no danger in the household, and we have no problem having Father Seromba being heard as from Tuesday in which manner we will be complying with the applicable law and the jurisprudence.  Having him appear on the 2nd May, there is no cause for any transaction. In the event that you deny this motion, we would ask you -- that we are setting notice for your certification of our appeal? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, do you wish to reaction to that motion by the Defence.  
MR. MOSES:
I certainly do, Your Honours.  Your Honours, my learned friend has referred to Article 20, "Rights of Accused," and he has referred to paragraph 4(G), which says, "An Accused is not to be compelled to testify against himself or herself or to confess guilt.  There was nothing, with the greatest respect, in Your Honours' decision from last Friday, which compels this Accused to testify.  It is his decision.  He can choose to testify or he can choose not to testify as some Accused do make their decision in this Tribunal.  It is not a matter of compelling him whatsoever.  It is a matter of judicial economy, a matter of efficient management of the trial.  Your Honours made it quite clear to all counsel, well before Easter, that matters were to be arranged so that the evidence could be concluded this Thursday, and Your Honours, in fact, sought indications from the Defence as to how long the evidence in-chief of the remaining witnesses would take.  So, no one can be surprised, with the greatest respect to my learned friend,  that Your Honours indication on Friday that not only Your Honours indicated and ordered the Prosecutor to complete his cross-examination of the previous witness last Friday, but also ordered the Defence to have the Accused testify today.  One issue which my friend seems to have strangely omitted in his argument, it is in reference as to why there is any problem with the Accused testifying today, and what possible prejudice could arise for the Accused in the event of Your Honours' order for Friday.  The Prosecutor submits that there is, in fact, absolutely no prejudice for the Accused, and it was, in fact, a proper order that Your Honours made last Friday.  My learned friends referred, in passing, to the decision -- of the Ntahobali decision from the Butare decision, from the Butare trial, I have a copy of the decision for you, Your Honours, and at the moment it is only in English.  As I understand, I got a copy from my learned friend, I take it they, as they have referred to it, already have a copy of this decision.  Paragraph 17 -- paragraph 17 appears to be the pertinent and most relevant paragraph of the decision, and similarly, to this present location, the Defence in the Ntahobali case tries to argue that it was a breach of the Accused's rights under Article 20 of the statute.  The Trial Chamber says in the second sentence to paragraph 17, "This Tribunal has already determined that no mention of the timing of an appearance of an accused is to be found in Articles 19 or 20 of the statute.  Whereas under Rule 90F, the Chamber has an "obligation" -- and I stress, obligation, and authority, to exercise control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses.  Then it goes on in the next sentence to refer to the principle matter that my learned friend referred to from the Kodic and Cerkez decision; the bureau goes on, however, to say this:  "However, Chambers have also considered the interests of justice and questions for judicial economy in ordering a particular sequence of witnesses," and it refers to the decision of Ndayambaje, decision on the Prosecutors motion to modify sequence of appearances, dated 27th February 1994.  So, there are factors which Your Honours are perfectly entitled by law to take into account, and those are the interests of justice in questions of judicial economy.   

As I say, in looking at the interest of justice, the Defence have pointed to nothing whatsoever that could indicate any prejudice at all to the Defence by this Accused testifying in accordance with Your Honours' order of last Friday.  And in terms of judicial economy, Your Honours have indicated - and the trial can conclude this Thursday if the Accused testified today.  

So that is the factors Your Honours are entitled to take into account, and with the greatest of respect to my learned friend, Your Honours -- the Prosecution submits that Your Honours have quite properly taken into account in reaching your decision.  The Prosecutor submits, this Accused has shown little respect submission for Your Honours decision from day one, when he refused to appear in Court, for the opening of his case.  This is simply another -- yet another indication of the Accused showing little or no respect for this Court and this Trial Chamber's orders.  An order needs to have force - it needs to be complied with.  The Prosecution submits that whether or not this Accused decides to testify, is perfectly in his sphere; he is entitled to choose to testify, he is entitled to choose not to testify.  Your Honours have made an order, and there has been nothing from what has been indicated in the supplication today which should give rise to variation of the order that Your Honours made last Friday.  And with the greatest respect to my learned friend, there are no grounds either for certification of Your Honours orders as well.

Those are the matters that the Prosecution wishes to raise.  Thank you, Your Honours. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecutor.  We will adjourn, and we will hand down our ruling shortly. 

Thank you.  We adjourn briefly.

(Court resumed at 1140H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is in session.  We were awaiting the reaction by the Defence team.  Our apologies for having made everyone wait.  We have now been informed that the Defence team is present.  

Counsel Nekuie, you have the floor. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  

Madam President, the Defence has just been served with the text of your decision or, at least, with the transcript.  We are working on the response by Defence, and I was given the mandate to request from your Court that we adjourn until 2:30, so as to be able to provide the response of Defence -- of the Defence team.  Thank you, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Does the Prosecutor wish to react?  It seems that the response by the Defence would be provided 
by 2:30. 
MS. ARBIA: 
Yes, Madam President, Your Honours, just a few words.  I failed to understand -- if I understood you correctly, you handed down a decision.  The decision is known by all the parties.  So if we are to expect a reaction, it means that then we are expecting the Accused to mention whether he intends to testify or not.  

The Defence team is now telling us that they are waiting for the written version of the decision before they can react.  I fail to understand, Madam President, and I wish to know what procedure would be followed for the next few hours.  If the Defence wishes to obtain certification of appeal, that would be one different matter altogether, but we would like to know how we are going to proceed and what the decision of the Accused would be in the couple of hours.  

So, for the record, I respectfully submit that, in my humble opinion, this would be the only reaction we would be awaiting, that is to say, whether the Accused is ready to testify before this Chamber, according to the timetable that had been fixed beforehand.  So, at 2:30, we expect the Accused to tell us whether he is willing to testify before this Chamber or not.  I believe that would be the only possibility, save the possibility for the Defence to certify the appeal against your decision.  But as for what we are to do in the hours to come, this would be the only decision we would be awaiting -- is the Accused still willing to testify, yes or no?  And, in that way, we would all be in a position to organise ourselves for the few days to come.  I thank you, Madam President.  

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecutor.

Counsel Nekuie, would you like to add to that?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, indeed, Madam President, I would like to provide clarifications on the mission entrusted to all of us.  The Prosecutor refers to Accused, this is what it is there to do, and the Defence also has its role to play, which is to defend the Accused.  And, in this distribution of task, the Prosecutor should not pretend that the Defence has any intentions whatsoever.  

The Defence should be left to work according its rules. The duty -- the onus is on the Defence to indicate the position of the Accused, and the Defence is saying that that would be done at 2:30.  I do not understand why this would bring about speculations from the accusations.  Those were the clarifications I wished to provide. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber would not like to engage in polemics.  That is the reason for which we shall adjourn the session and resume at 2:30, to hear the position of the Defence team regarding the testimony of the Accused as a witness in his own case.  So the session is adjourned and shall resume at 2:30.
Thank you to all of you.  
(Court recessed from 1145H to 1433H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is called to order.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  We are going to ask the Defence to address the Court as planned.  Who would like to address the Court, Counsel Monthé? 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Yes.  Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Your Honours, 
good afternoon.  I think that this case today we have come to a junction.  As Jean-Paul Sarthe said, when you deliberate the cards are already on the table.  You gave an oral decision this morning, 
Madam President, in conditions that rather surprised me.  You did not want this decision to be changed in any way.  You gave it to us in a draft form, and I don't think that it is, therefore, an official version.  

As the lawyer that I am from the school of Bordeaux, I think that we should not enforce rules of such a nature, and that is why I am in a difficult position here.  I need to make sure that Father Seromba is defended in a right manner, and I will -- should not give way.  And I should respectfully submit, 
Madam President, that I thought about this to the Accused, and as a barrister, I shall now ask for the disqualification of the Judges of this Chamber under Rule 15 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Does the -- would the Prosecutor like to address the Court on this subject?  
MR. MOSES: 
I don't wish to address any of what my friend said.  I want to know whether this is an oral motion or whether he has filed a written motion to his feat.  It's completely without basis, in the Prosecution submission, this application, but at this stage, I don't wish to make any further comments.  Thank you, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecutor.  

Does your motion exist in writing or have you just submitted an oral motion?  Presumably, you are submitting this motion to the bureau who can rule on such a matter -- who can rule on the matter of disqualification of Judges.
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, there is a written version of this motion, and it has been prepared according to procedure. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Maybe, you could also tell us, Counsel Monthé, what you plan for the rest of the trial, because I suppose that, for you, the trial ends here? 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, I think that it is self-evident that the bureau will rule on this matter. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We, therefore, deem that we cannot pursue the debate in view of the fact that the Defence has asked for the disqualification of the three Judges composing the Trial Chamber.  So, there will no further hearing until the bureau has ruled on the matter, and we will see what happens as a result.  

Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, you may address the Court. 
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, the only thing I am unclear of, my friend has said that a motion has been prepared.  Has it been filed with the bureau?  Because that, surely must be a matter for Your Honours to consider, whether or not it has been filed.  Because if it has been filed, we can then wait for the bureau to rule, but if it has not been filed, and my friends wait some time to, in fact, file such a motion, then that will cause additional delay to the proceedings.  So, did I understand my friend to say that he has, in fact, filed a motion, because that was unclear to me whether that was the situation, or that he has just prepared a motion for filing?  In which case, when can we expect to be in receipt of such a motion?  Thank you. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Prosecutor, I think that the air is rather charged at this time.  I think that you have been working for the Tribunal for a while now, and you know, of course, that for disqualification of Judges, there is a procedure to be followed and you didn't quite catch what I said.  I said that I had seized the bureau with a motion.  Of course, you could wait if you wanted for Seromba -- Father Seromba to be actually convicted, but it is my role to defend him. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So, if I have understood correctly, the motion has been filed.  And, maybe, Counsel Monthé could, with the permission of the President of the bureau, also communicate the motion to the other party, because everyone needs to be informed of it. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Yes, if the court clerk could approach my desk, I can then give him the piece of paper.  This document is the original, and I would like to have it back, please. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is adjourned.  Thank you.  No dates are foreseen.
