Madam Prosecutor, will you be conducting the cross-examination of Witness BZ5?

Yes, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Witness, we should like to remind you that you are still under oath.  Counsel for the Prosecution is going to continue with the cross-examination of you.  We ask you to listen attentively to the questions put to you and answer them as briefly and as concisely as possible.  
MS. ALEXIS:
Thank you Madam President, Your Honours. 
WITNESS BZ5,
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness BZ5.
A.	Good afternoon. 
Q.	Witness, can you confirm that on the 6th of April 1999 when President Habyarimana died, that you were in Gitarama préfecture -- sorry.
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President and, indeed, the interpreters, I was told that I said 1999.  I will repeat that question. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Can you confirm, Witness, on the 6th of April 1994 when President Habyarimana died, that you were in Gitarama préfecture? 
A.	Yes, I was in Gitarama préfecture, in Rugobagoba secteur, that secteur is located in Gitarama. 
Q.	And you had gone there in that préfecture to work; isn't that so? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you tell us, Witness, when in 1994 did you first go to Gitarama préfecture to work? 
A.	When Habyarimana died on the 6th, if my memory serves me well, that was the third time that I was going to that secteur in Gitarama where I was.  Now, I don't remember the months in which I went to that place, but I do know that I would go and return, go back and return, et cetera.  It wasn't the first time that I had gone to that area. 
Q.	Now, Witness, I know it was a long time ago, and I am not asking you for a specific date.  Can you tell us approximately which month you first went; was it January, was it February, approximately? 
A.	I'm not in a position to remember which month, but I do remember I began going to that place in 1993, but I can't tell you which month.  In 1994 I was returning to that place on a different occasion. 
Q.	The first -- well, do I understand you, Witness, to be saying that when you were in that commune on the 6th of April 1994 that it may have been the third time, perhaps, that you had gone there to work?  Was that what you said?  
A.	Yes.  In fact, it was the third time.  First I spent three months there, then five months.  You must understand I would go for a lengthy period of time to that place to accomplish some work.  Let me remind you, I went there for work, to get work done. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, Witness, I have asked you if you remember when was the first time you went to that commune to work.  So I'm now going to ask you a different question.  My question is this; when you were there on the 6th of April 1994, as you said it was the third time, approximately what date on that third time did you go to that commune? 
A.	If my memory serves me well, those events took place 11 years ago, I didn't know I was going to be asked these types of questions after so many years and so I don't remember the dates.  Really, I can't tell you the date, even less so the time.  I don't remember such details.  Now at the time had I known that I would be asked these types of questions later, perhaps, I would have remembered those details. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  But just try to assist us.  I will rephrase my question.  When I ask you about time I don't expect you to be able to tell us the exact time or the exact date.  I am just asking you an approximate date.  Okay.  Now, on the 6th of April 1994 how long approximately before that date had you been at the Rugobagoba commune on that third occasion that you went there?  Do you understand the question, Witness? 
A.	First of all, Rugobagoba is not a commune; it is a secteur in Gitarama.  I'm not sure I understand the question the way you put it to me.  If you ask me, for example, how much time I had spent there after Habyarimana died, perhaps I could understand and answer you. 
Q.	Okay, Witness.  I will rephrase my question.  My question is before Habyarimana died, you told us that on the 6th of April 1994 you were in that secteur, yes? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	My question is this, since you were there on the 6th, how long before the 6th had you been there, was it one week, was it one month; approximately how long before the 6th had you been in that secteur? 
A.	There I still don't understand the question.  I told you that when Habyarimana died I was there on the third occasion; at which occasion are you referring to in that question?  
Q.	I am talking about the third occasion.  Do you want me to repeat my question, Witness? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Okay.  This is my question:  On the 6th of April 1994 you were at Rugobagoba secteur.  How long before the 6th of April 1994 had you already been there?  Were you there in March already to begin to work?  When did you arrive?  
A.	Let me give you an estimate.  I can't be too specific with regard to the time, it has been a long time, you will understand.  Let me remind, you in early 1994 I was at my home with my family; that is where I lived.  Two weeks later, approximately, three or three and a half months had just gone by, by the time the 6th rolled around when I was in that location. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And that is what I mean when I ask you for a date.  You have assisted the Court, thank you.  And you said that you first started to go to that secteur -- 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Sorry? 
A.	No, let me add something.  I gave you an estimate, earlier I mentioned that 11 years have gone by since the event took place.  So I'm not in a position to give you exact figures; it was just an estimate.  I just gave you an estimate of the time I had spent there. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, I'm asking you for another estimate.  You said that you started to go to that secteur to work in 1993.  Was it in early 1993, in the middle of 1993, or late 1993? 
A.	It was in April 1993. 
Q.	Can you confirm, Witness, that soon after the death of the president that roadblocks were set up? 
A.	In my testimony I told you that I learned of the news of the president's death the next day.  I didn't see any changes where I was.  I didn't see any roadblocks nor any unrest.  The next day, the situation changed.  People began to gather information about people who were housed here and there, information about people.  That is when I decided to do everything in my power to return to my native region.

Even if I remained in that place for a while, all of the people in that secteur didn't know me necessarily.  Some of them, for example, may have wanted to decide to attack me. 
Q.	Around this time, which we take to be by your evidence, the 8th of April 1994 when things changed.  Would you agree with me, Witness, that one of these changes was that Tutsis started to be put in danger? 
A.	I never said that there was any change with regard to the Tutsi.  I said that where I was I could see that people started to ask people for their identity cards.  I was not the only individual to be in that area who was a stranger to that area.  People started to ask questions overall about the origins of those who were in that location, but we didn't talk about Tutsi.  People asked questions of those who were housing us, who is this person, et cetera, but there was no real distinction made between Hutus and Tutsis when those types of questions were asked. 
Q.	Isn't it true, Witness, that at this time, that is in April 1994, that ethnicity was reflected on the identification cards in Rwanda? 
A.	I don't understand your question. 
Q.	I will rephrase it.  At that time in Rwanda, in April 1994, an identification card will show whether someone was Hutus or Tutsi, isn't that so? 
A.	You are asking me if that information was contained on the identity cards.  I'm not sure I understand my question. 
Q.	You have, in fact, understood my question; that's exactly what I am asking you, Witness.  Are you able to answer? 
A.	If I have understood you correctly, you are asking me if the identity cards that we had at the time mentioned the bearers ethnic group; is that what you mean?  
Q.	Yes, Witness, can you answer the question? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	So would you agree with me that anyone who looked at someone else's identification card would know whether that person was Hutu or Tutsi? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You knew in 1994 that there was a priest at Nyange parish named Father Straton, didn't you? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And, of course, you would have heard that before April 1994 Father Straton had left Nyange parish to go elsewhere; isn't that so? 
A.	No, I didn't learn that. 
Q.	In April, 1994 -- well, before I ask you that question, Witness, isn't it true that you first met the Accused Athanase Seromba in January 1994? 
A.	First, I didn't meet him, I went to Mass; it was a habit.  I told you that I was baptized in that parish.  I always went to the same parish.  I went to Mass on my mother's back; as I grew older I kept going to that parish.  That really was the church that I would go to all of the time. 
Q.	Witness, you did not answer my question.  Perhaps you can listen very carefully to it, it is very simple.  In -- isn't it true that you met -- or first saw Athanase Seromba, the Accused, in January 1994; is that true or is it not? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	The bourgmestre of your commune, do you remember his name, that is Kivumu commune in April 1994? 
A.	I remember there was a bourgmestre called Charles Bushagaro (phonetic), later he was replaced by someone else. 
Q.	If I suggest -- I'm sorry, are you finished, Witness? 
A.	Wait just one moment, Madam Prosecutor, I'm trying to remember the name of the official in charge of the commune during that period.  I think his name was Ndahimana. 
Q.	And might I assist you witness that it was Grégoire Ndahimana? 
A.	I can't confirm whether or not his first name was Grégoire, but I remember his last name was Ndahimana.  I can imagine, I can see the place where he lived and I remember his face, but I can't confirm that his first name was Grégoire. 
Q.	Witness, the fact that you cannot remember the first name of the bourgmestre, do you agree with me that the reason you are unable to remember the first name of the bourgmestre was that in April 1994 and the months before April 1994, that you spent most of your time in Gitarama préfecture? 
A.	That is one of the reasons, yes; but I should also point out that I did not have a habit of going to the communal office.  That wasn't the place I would go to on a regular basis.  That is why I didn't always know who the commune employees were. 
Q.	So you would agree with me, Witness, that at that time you were not very familiar with who were the communal authorities in your area? 
A.	Let me remind you that our commune was one of the largest in the préfecture.  So much so that natives from that commune could spend their entire life in the commune without ever going to the communal office.  So it wasn't unusual to meet a person in the commune who didn't know who the bourgmestre was, for example. 
Q.	Witness, you will tell me if I am misquoting your evidence.  Is it therefore your evidence that you were not familiar with who the communal authorities were because, one, you spent a lot of time in Gitarama préfecture, and as well, Kivumu commune was a very large one.  Is that your evidence? 
A.	Exactly. 
Q.	Was it your evidence, Witness, that you did not arrive in Kivumu commune until around 6 p.m. on the 10th of April 1994? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	On the 11th of April 1994 wouldn't -- sorry, would you agree with me that you did not go to Nyange parish church? 
A.	That is correct.  In fact, on the 11th of April I could see there were bodies of neighbours who had been killed lying on the ground.  And so we buried the bodies of those neighbours, those bodies were spread out on the hills. 
Q.	Can you tell us, Witness, if you recall whether those neighbours of yours who had been killed and whose bodies you saw, were they mostly Tutsi? 
A.	Yes, that is right. 
Q.	You went to Nyange parish church on the 12th of April 1994, is that your evidence, Witness? 
A.	Yes, that is right, I would go there in order to pray. 
Q.	And to be fair to you, Witness, since you said that your memory has faded somewhat because it was 11 years ago, you can't confirm as a fact that on that particular date the 12th of April 1994, that you went to Nyange parish church, was that the correct date? 
A.	I remember that date very well because it was the last day on which was able to attend Mass in Rwanda, it was the very last time that I attended Mass in Rwanda. 
Q.	On that day, the 12th of April 1994 it was your evidence that it was Athanase Seromba, the Accused, who led the Mass; is that so? 
A.	Yes, that is right. 
Q.	And is it your evidence, Witness, that aside from Athanase Seromba, on that day, the 12th of April 1994, you did not see any other clergyman at the church? 
A.	Yes, that is right. 
Q.	Witness, do you recall what day of the week the 12th of April 1994 was, if you recall? 
A.	I don't remember what day it was. 
Q.	And you would agree with me, Witness, that you again went to the church on the 13th of April 1994, couldn't you? 
A.	Do you mean for the second time because I went to Mass on the 12th in the morning of the 12th, so are you asking me if I went back to the church on the 13th, in other words, the second time around wouldn't it be?  
Q.	Yes, Witness, you have understood me clearly? 
A.	Yes, that's right. 
Q.	Now, on the 12th of April 1994 when you went to the church there were already refugees Tutsi refugees hiding in the church; isn't that so? 
A.	On the 12th when I went to Mass I wasn't able to determine who was Tutsi or who was Hutu because at Mass both were present.  And then if there were only Tutsis, I wouldn't have been there, for instance, so there was a mixture of Hutus and Tutsi at the church that day. 
Q.	I take it therefore, Witness, that you are Hutu in ethnic origin? 
A.	Yes, you have right. 
Q.	Well, Witness, you said you were not able to see whether the people gathered on the 12th of Hutus or Tutsi, very well.  My question then is this, were there refugees and I'm not here talking about whether they were Hutus or Tutsis, were there refugees in the church on the 12th of April 1994? 
A.	When I got to the church I wasn't able to determine who was a refugee and who was not, but what I remember is that during the homily the priest encouraged us to help one another.  He asked us to love one another as neighbours.  He also made mention of the situation of the refugees who were present.  He didn't say whether they were Tutsi or not.  He spoke of our brothers who are here.  And he asked the Christians attending mass to come to the assistance of those refugees as far as they could by providing money, food stuff and other consumables.  And he encouraged everyone to come and help these people. 
Q.	Now since it was your evidence, Witness, that you lived about 10 to 15 kilometres away from the church would you agree with me that you do not know when those refugees arrived at the church? 
A.	In fact, I do not know when those refugees got to the parish. 
Q.	As well, Witness, you would agree with me that you do not know how the refugees got to the church; that is whether they walked, whether they took a taxi, or whether they were transported to the church? 
A.	That is right. 
Q.	All you know, Witness, is that when you returned on the 13th of April 1994 that there were many more people at the church; isn't that so? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you yourself did not go to that church either on the 14th or the 15th of April 1994; isn't that so? 
A.	No, I didn't go back to the church on those dates.  I would go back there much later after the church was destroyed. 
Q.	Was it your evidence, Witness, that you went to the church on the 16th of April 1994 after the church was destroyed? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And on this occasion, that is on the 16th of April 1994, you actually went to an area about 15 metres in front of the church where there was a statue of the Virgin Mary; is that so?
A.	Yes, that's right. 
Q.	And on that date --  
A.	Excuse me, Madam, I believe that between the church and the statue there wouldn't be only 15 metres, it would be more than 15 metres. 
Q.	Okay, Witness, well you tell us, give us an estimate.  How far is the statue of the Virgin Mary from the church at Nyange parish? 
A.	Between the church and the statue of the Virgin Mary, I think there is more, it would be at least 50, five, zero metres, if not more. 
Q.	Witness, I'm going to ask you to look at the photograph.
MS. ALEXIS:
Can the witness be shown the photograph -- well, let me hand my photocopy, and if it is not useful we will use the photographs; but for the record it is a photocopy of what has been entered into evidence already as Prosecution Exhibit 3-12. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Yes, Witness, now that you have looked at that photograph.  You said that you were at the statue of the Virgin Mary on the 16th of April 1994.  On that photograph do you see the area that you were standing, where you were standing -- sorry, on the 16th of April, 1994 by the statue of the Virgin Mary? 
A.	No, I do not see that location.  A moment ago I testified that between the church and the statue of the Virgin Mary there was a significant distance not less than 50 metres from the statue up to the road leading to Kibuye and the branch of the road before you get to the church itself there is more than 15 metres.  So I do not agree with you when you say between the statue and the church there was only a distance of 15 metres.  I do not agree with you on that issue. 
Q.	Witness, you have said that the statue was, I believe, 50 metres, five, zero, from the church; was that your evidence? 
A.	Yes, that is what I said. 
Q.	When you were at the statue of the Virgin Mary, were you standing there alone or were there many other people there with you? 
A.	Now, let me be specific and say that when we refer to the area near the statue it is at the centre; when we refer to that centre in general one refers to the statue, but it is not specifically the statue itself or the structure which shelters the statue.  No, we are referring, indeed, to the trading centre.  And when someone says that they were there, they would say that they were near the statue.  And in the countryside one could send someone to the centre and he would be told go and fetch such and such an object or item from near by the statue.  That does not necessarily mean that the person would go to the place where the statue is, and it is rather the centre, the trading centre and that is one thing that I wanted you to understand. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  So is it, therefore, your evidence if I understand you correctly that -- that on the 16th of April 1994 you were, in fact, at the Nyange commercial centre.  Is that your evidence? 
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  Whilst at the Nyange commercial centre were you there alone or were there many other people there with you? 
A.	I would like to remind you of why I had gone to Nyange.  When I was at home in my secteur which is far from the church, we had got to know -- well, this was the rumour going around that the Inyenzi had attacked the church and they had destroyed it.  Now, we as Christians, who were praying at that church we thought that we needed to know exactly what had happened, was it really true that our church which we had known for such a long time, was it true that what was being said about it was true.  So many people, I wasn't the only one, ran to, in fact, verify what we were hearing from the rumours, whether the information we received was true or not.  People from the various secteurs ran and went to verify whether, indeed, the church had come down, whether the church had collapses; that was, in fact, the term that was being used at the time, it was said that the church had collapsed. 
Q.	Am I to understand, therefore, from your answer that you were agreeing with me that there were many other people there with you at the commercial centre?  Do I understand correctly? 
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	Can you tell us, Witness, since -- 
A.	Yes. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Sorry interpreters.  
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Can you tell us, Witness, since you have been given us estimates, approximately how far the commercial centre is from the parish? 
A.	I'm going to give you an estimate.  And I would say that the distance between the two places is at least 25 metres. 
Q.	From the commercial centre, is it true that you went up to where the church was on the 16th of April 1994? 
A.	Yes, that is true.  Let me remind you though that when we would go to church we would meet other people who were coming from the church.  There was a crowd of people who were going to the church and they would meet with others who were coming away from the church, but we did not come from the same secteur. 
Q.	When you arrived close to where the church was, were there still attackers surrounding the area? 
A.	I told you that when we learned of the news of the destruction of the church we left our respective families to go and check whether the church had, indeed, come down, collapsed.  When we got there I wouldn't be able to tell you who had actually destroyed the church nor what those people may have used to destroy the church.  I arrived when the church was already down and there were only bricks on the ground. 
Q.	But my question is this, Witness, when you arrived, were there still present in that area, that is the area around where the church had been, were there many attackers still present? 
A.	I have just told you that I'm unable to say who had participated in the attacks.  I myself could have been confused for the attackers.  When I came I met with people who were leaving and another crowd was going to the church.  So I was meeting people.  So I wouldn't be able to say who had participated in the destruction of the church and those who had come to see the ruins of the church.  During the destruction of the church I wasn't present and I do not know what had been used for destroying the church.

There were only the ruins of the church.  The bricks were all that we could see on the ground.  And I do not know who had destroyed the church since I wasn't present when it was being brought down 
Q.	However, you were made to pick up dead bodies; was that your evidence? 
A.	I don't know whether that is the case of those who had already gone home.  But in my case when I went up there were people who forced us to take a particular path or direction and those who had just arrived were shown which way to go. 
Q.	Were there many other people aside from you who were forced to pick up dead bodies? 
A.	I have just told you that all those who were going up towards the church were directed either to the left or to the right. 
Q.	How long, Witness, approximately an estimate, how long did you pick up dead bodies for on that evening on the 16th of April 1994? 
A.	As far as I am concerned, when I was forced to remove the dead bodies, and let me specify that we were afraid, we had come here unaware that there were people who had been affected when the church fell down.  I lived several kilometres from the church and we had come to check whether the church had been destroyed and here we were in front of the people who were forcing us to go one way or the other.  We were afraid and we came to the ruins quite close by there.  There were bulldozers.  We were beaten.  Two people would pick up a body and would put it in the shovel of the bulldozer.  Because of that fear, we wanted to leave that place by all means possible.  And we tried to hide in the crowd so that we could go back with those who were going away.  If you were successful that was your luck; but if you were unsuccessful, you were forced to continue to remove the dead bodies.  And you may remove more than two or three body, in that manner. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  But my question was specifically for you, approximately, if you recall, how many dead bodies did you pick up on that day? 
A.	There were two of us who would be picking up one body.  May I answer?  
Q.	Certainly, I'm speaking of you in particular, how many dead bodies did you pick up? 
A.	I was saying that two people were required to pick up a body.  Three people could also do the same to show that we had worked.  Personally, me and my partner we picked up bodies which we put into the shovel of the bulldozer. 
Q.	How many bodies, Witness? 
A.	I have told you that I personally touched two bodies. 
Q.	How long did you spend there at the church picking up dead bodies? 
A.	I didn't stay there longer than one minute.  The lorry was quite close to where we were.  After having had loaded the two bodies, you would realise that there were new people arriving who would relay.  So after leaving that place and after being replaced by two other people, I sneaked into the crowd, since I was used to the area.  And I went into the inner courtyard of the presbytery.  It was matter of being able to hide one self to look for an opportunity to hide in the crowd and go away. 
Q.	When you went to the church on the 16th of April 1994, you would agree with me, would you not, Witness, that you did not go there to look for any authorities of any kind; isn't that so? 
A.	I didn't go there in order to look for or see any authority whatsoever.  I had gone there to see whether the church had, in fact, been destroyed.  Furthermore, I wasn't aware whether any authorities were there.  My intent had been to go and find out whether the church had really come down. 
Q.	And after this one minute of picking up bodies, what you wanted to do, Witness, was to go home, isn't that so? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	This, Witness, would have been the first time that you ever had to do such a job, picking up dead bodies, isn't that so? 
A.	That is correct.  At the church, of course, I told you and you know full well that when you lose a family member, you help that person.  Not everyone is going to lift the body to put it into the tomb.  It was on the 11th when I touched a dead body for the first time; at the church it was the second time. 
Q.	Around what time was this that you finished picking up these dead bodies, Witness? 
A.	At the church?  
Q.	Yes, Witness, on the 16th of April 1994? 
A.	We couldn't look at a watch.  What I am telling you is part of history.  It seems to me that you think we are having just a simple conversation, but I was there for the events and traumatized by them.  So I didn't think about looking at my watch to see if the sun was setting, for example.  That wasn't my major concern; our main concern was to get out of the area.  I don't know how to explain that. 
Q.	You had said, Witness, that is when you were being questioned by the counsel for the Accused that you arrived at the church on the 16th of April 1994 at 3 or 4 o'clock in the afternoon; do you maintain that evidence? 
A.	I stand by my statement. 
Q.	Witness --  
A.	But I wasn't too specific with regard to the time, I said at around that time. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Before you were forced to go up to the church or -- sorry, before you went up to the church and were forced to pick up bodies, can you tell us approximately how long, that is, how much time did you spend standing by the commercial centre? 
A.	I didn't stop at the commercial centre.  I told you that you have to go by the commercial centre to get to the church.  I didn't say that I stopped at the commercial centre. 
Q.	So am I, therefore, to understand that you spent absolutely no time at the commercial centre; is that your evidence? 
A.	Absolutely, it is on the road.  It is as if you were crossing a bridge.  You cross the bridge and continue along your way. 
Q.	But in any event, Witness, if we were to try to give estimates, when you were at the church picking up dead bodies, it would have already have been sometime after 4 p.m. in the afternoon on that day; isn't that so? 
A.	I told you it was between 3 and 4 in the afternoon. 
Q.	Did you notice, Witness, when you went to pick up these dead bodies that there were hundreds of dead bodies lying around the pile of bricks where the church had been? 
A.	How can I say that there were hundreds of bodies.  It was a very large church.  That was one of the first churches built in Rwanda.  A lot of history was made there.  If you had seen the church before it was destroyed you would have an idea of why I wasn't in a position to count the bodies there.  If you had seen the church before it was destroyed I would then, maybe, be able to give you a satisfactory answer. 
Q.	Okay, Witness, I'm not asking you to tell me the exact figure.  My question is this -- well, perhaps, I will rephrase.  Were there many dead bodies, did you see two dead bodies or were there many, many dead bodies? 
A.	What do you mean by "many bodies"?
Q.	Did you see two bodies, did you see ten?  Tell us, did it look as if the bodies were very many or did it look as if there were hardly any bodies.  I'm just asking for an estimate, Witness.  I know you did not count? 
A.	At the very beginning I told you different crowds of people were coming from different areas on their way to the church.  To navigate through the crowd or get out of the crowd it was difficult.  There were some crowds of people looking for the dead bodies, there were others moving the bricks and the beams were lying on top of the people.  It was mayhem.  You could only move the body lying in front of you.  I also told you that these events took place 11 years ago.  I was an eyewitness to them, but I don't know how to explain it to you.  I don't know how to explain it.  Moreover I shouldn't go back over those events.  
Since my birth I had never seen a dead person and all of a sudden you are being asked to move dead bodies, it was horrible.  I went to that place to see if the church had been destroyed.  I couldn't have been thinking or have an idea of how many dead bodies there were.  The events were traumatizing; sometimes you didn't even have enough strength to eat. 
Q.	Very well, Witness, thank you.  Now, Witness, how -- well, approximately how old were you in 1994? 
A.	I was 18 or 19. 
Q.	And then --  
A.	I had finished primary school just two years prior to that. 
Q.	And these events, according to you, "they were horrible", weren't they? 
A.	I can't find a word to describe the events.  You are asking me about events that you did not experience, I did.  I had never seen a dead person.  When you go with someone who has lost a family member you certainly would not touch that dead family member's body, and yet during those events I was being asked to touch the dead bodies; it is beyond understanding.  You are touching someone who was bleeding.  At any rate, it was complete mayhem. 
Q.	Witness, I'm looking for a word to assist you in describing how you felt traumatised, would you agree with me that you were disgusted by all of these dead bodies and having to see all of this blood and so on; would you agree with me? 
A.	Absolutely.  That is why I went through the crowd and then tried to wash up.  I went three days without eating a bite. 
Q.	Yet, it is your evidence, Witness, that even if, according to you, it was horrible, that you were traumatized and that you just wanted to get out of the area, you still had time to have a conversation with Athanase Seromba by the taps; isn't that your evidence, Witness?  
A.	I did not speak to Seromba.  When I arrived at the taps there were other people there, they also needed to wash up.  They were in a row.  And it was rather Seromba who found us there.  He was saddened by what had happened.  In fact, it is really difficult for someone who witnessed those events, who was on site.  And when you -- when the events come back to mind, it hurts.  I can't find a word that could describe it. 
Q.	At these taps which you claimed you washed your hands at, where exactly on the premises are these taps located? 
A.	When you go into the courtyard on the wall where there was a door, you pass it about 50 metres and there is another small door; it is a small book shop.  The door was on that wall.  There is another small entrance where a priest and a white man sold books.  The tap was right there. 
Q.	Witness, am I to understand -- well, let me just ask you, are you -- where exactly are these tabs; are they inside of the presbytery or outside of the presbytery? 
A.	The tap was in the presbytery's courtyard. 
Q.	And when you saw Athanase Seromba at this time, had he come outside of the presbytery when you said you saw him and he spoke to you all and he looked saddened, where exactly was he? 
A.	I have told you when I went in the courtyard I came across other people who had also come to wash up. 
Q.	Witness, you said that you were very familiar with Nyange church from since your childhood, is that what you said? 
A.	Absolutely. 
Q.	And you also said, Witness, if I am not mistaken, that it was a very large church, is that what you said? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	Before April 1994, you attended Mass at that church at Nyange parish; isn't that so?
A.	Absolutely. 
Q.	So, you would agree with me, Witness, that Nyange parish church being a very large church, it was a church in peace time in which hundreds of people would attend? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	When you went to the church on the 16th -- when you went to Nyange parish where the church had been on the 16th of April 1994, you did not go there specifically to look for Athanase Seromba, did you? 
A.	I don't understand your question. 
Q.	When you went to the church on the 16th of April 1994, wasn't it your evidence that you went just to see what had happened to the church? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	On that day when you were going towards the church, it was not your intention to go there to look for Athanase Seromba; isn't that so? 
A.	Absolutely. 
Q.	Aside from the 12th and the 13th and the 16th, according to you, of 1994, April, you did not see Athanase Seromba in that month of April, did you? 
A.	I didn't go back to the church.  I was traumatised by what had happened there, so that was the last time that I saw the priest. 
Q.	I'm not sure you answered my question, Witness.  I'm asking you in April 1994 -- well, perhaps, I can start over.  You saw Athanase Seromba on the 12th of April 1994 was that your evidence? 
A.	To be clear I saw him on the 12th of April 1994 during the last Mass I attended.  I came back on the 16th of April and that was the last time. 
Q.	Aside from the 12th and the 16th of April 1994, in April 1994 you did not see Athanase Seromba; would you agree with that? 
A.	Apart from Father Seromba I didn't, in fact, see any other priest.  But I must repeat that I was speaking about Rwanda. 
Q.	Witness, perhaps we don't understand each other.  I will ask my question again.  I did not ask you about other priests.  This is my question; apart from the 12th and 16th of April you did not on any other time in April 1994 see Athanase Seromba; is that your evidence, do I understand you correctly? 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Therefore -- 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Therefore, Witness -- 
MS. ALEXIS:
Sorry interpreters.  
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Therefore, Witness, aside from those two days in April 1994, the 12th and the 16th, when you saw Athanase Seromba you cannot tell this Court what he said or did in April 1994; isn't that so?  Since the only time you saw him was on the 12th and 16th? 
A.	Aren't you convinced that those two days are sufficient, if someone said they heard someone say something?  
Q.	Perhaps you don't understand my question.  My suggestion, Witness, and I will put it again; I will try to rephrase it.  Your evidence is that you saw Athanase Seromba on the 12th and on the 16th.  
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	I am asking you this, were you a witness to anything he said or did in April 1994, putting aside the 12th and the 16th of April, when you were there at the church?  
A.	I cannot confirm anything since I was not an eyewitness on other dates. 
Q.	Athanase Seromba is like you, a Hutu, isn't he? 
A.	I don't know, I do not know to which ethnicity he belongs. 
Q.	Witness, all of this time you were in Rwanda before April 1994, you never heard that Athanase Seromba was a Hutu; no one suggested that to you? 
A.	It is not in the habit of Christians to know the ethnic group to which a priest belonged.  You could be sent a French or a Ugandan, all we were concerned with was to have a priest.  In any case that suggestion that you are making does not apply to Rwanda. 
Q.	I see.  The other priests you spoke of, Father Straton, you would agree with me that it was commonly known in Kivumu commune that he was Tutsi, isn't that so? 
A.	I don't know anything about that.  Whatever the origin of the priest we would be satisfied with the presence of that priest.  And furthermore, it is only after leaving Rwandan that I got to know that there was a difference between a vicar and a father.  For us, members of the congregation, a priest was a priest. 
Q.	Witness, you said that as a Christian, you told the truth.  Do you remember given that evidence? 
A.	Yes, I made that statement and I stand by it. 
Q.	Agreed, Witness, and you would as a Christian who spoke the truth, you would agree with me that all Christians should speak the truth, wouldn't you? 
A.	Yes, quite so. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.

MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, Your Honours that is the end of my cross-examination.

Madam President, for the record I had asked that the witness be shown a photocopy which he was not able to identify, therefore I will not ask that this photocopy be entered into evidence.  And I would, therefore, ask the registry if this photocopy could be returned to us.  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
I must tell you that I know the site of the building or structure which houses the statue of the Virgin Mary, but the building that is at the back of this picture is Codekoki.  There were other buildings which were destroyed. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And the witness is showing those places. 
THE WITNESS:
There was also a banana grove appearing in the photograph.  I do know the place.  That is what I wanted to tell you.  I told you that I started to go to this place since my childhood.  I know the layout or where the statue of the Virgin Mary is situated. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, perhaps I wasn't clear, maybe I didn't understand your evidence, but didn't you say that -- excuse me.  Didn't you say that you were unable to pinpoint in that photograph the statue of the Virgin Mary; was that your evidence? 
A.	You had asked me to show where I was.  So I told you that if you referred to the statue one could also be referring to the trading centre.  And on this photograph there is only part of that trading centre showing.  So when you were asking me where I was, it is a difficult question to answer.  But as for where the statue was, that is quite clear.  I told you that in current language when one said that one had gone to the statue it is not exactly where the statue was, but the trading centre. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
MR. MONTHÉ:
I am raising an objection.  I want to know whether the Prosecutor wants -- whether the witness should show her where the statue of the Virgin Mary was, because it would seem that she had asked the witness to show her where he was.  And this is why he had said that he cannot show where he was standing because it is not in the picture. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, this witness has been very clear about his evidence.  He has been very clear in his responses.  There is no need for this objection as phrased.  The witness is well able to clear up any ambiguities or any problems or misunderstanding about his evidence, and in fact, has done so.  And in light of what the witness has said with respect to this photocopy, I would now ask leave of the Court to continue with my questions to be completely fair to this witness with respect to that photocopy of the photograph that was entered into evidence.  Just a few questions, to be fair to the witness. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness --  
MS. ALEXIS:
Can the registry give the witness something to write with? 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, you said that were you able to point out the statue of the Virgin Mary.  If so, can you put the number 1 where you see that statue? 
A.	Where should I put that mark; is it on the door of the structure or below it?  
Q.	Below it, Witness.  Have you done so? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And can you, Witness, on that photograph put the number 2 on the location of the commercial centre, if it is there, or piece of the commercial centre.

And can you, Witness, place the number 3 by the building or on the building that you said was the Codekoki? 

Now, Witness, my last question to you is, are you able on that photograph to see approximately where you were standing at the commercial centre on the 16th of April 1994 before you moved on to the church?  Is that area on that photograph?  
A.	I told you that I passed by that centre.  I made a comparison also telling you that it was mere passage through as you do with a bridge when you are crossing a river.  So can you imagine that if you were asking someone about where he was on the bridge, whereas he passed through it.  So, in brief, I passed by the centre and it was on the way to the church.  In order to go from one bank to another of a river, you would use a passage on which there was a bridge so you would be merely passing through and not stopping.  So if I were to be asked where on the bridge where I was, I would say that I was on the whole bridge because I only passed through the bridge. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Since you passed through the commercial centre can you indicate to us on that photograph where is the commercial centre? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, he has already indicated this with a number 2.  You had asked him to show where the trading centre was or part thereof if it is on the picture.  If that is the case he has already done so by using the number 2. 

THE WITNESS:
To make her understand the situation better there is part of the trading centre on this photograph, but I'm unable to see the other part.  But it is quite possible that that building was destroyed.  There was a road which went by there and on either side there were buildings.  But here I'm only seeing the buildings that were on one side I don't see those that were on the other.  So, they may have been destroyed or maybe they are present but are not showing here on this photograph that I have. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Thank you, Witness, Madam President, you were right it was already pointed out, I was moving on numerically, and it happened already.   In that case, then Madam President, at this time, this is the end of my cross-examination and I have no further questions except for -- I have no further question for this witness.  And now Madam President I would ask this Court if the photocopy of Prosecution Exhibit P. 3-12 can now be entered into evidence as Prosecution Exhibit 34, I believe. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Monthé.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Before -- maybe before this can be done we would wish as the Defence to see what the witness has marked on the exhibit.  And if we can have that need satisfied we can respond to the Prosecutor's question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That will be done, Mr. Monthé.  Kindly show this document to the Chamber and to the various parties, registry.  

Mr. Monthé, have you seen the document?  Do you have any objection? 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
I have absolutely no objection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Very well, this document is admitted as Prosecution Exhibit and its reference will be           P.  47 -- one minute, please.  A moment please, 34, P. 34.
(Exhibit No. P. 34 admitted)
Mr. Nekuie or Mr. Monthé, do you wish to re-examine this witness?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Not at all Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  

Mr. Witness, we have reached the end of your testimony before this Tribunal.  We wish to thank you for having come to answer questions and now we wish you a safe return home. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  I would like to ask the Chamber for permission to meet Father Seromba so that I can greet him.  And then I would like to request that justice be rendered unto him.  

As an eyewitness, I am telling you frankly that he had no power to stop the events which occurred.  I do remember that UNAMIR was present in our country then and it had a lot of material in its possession.  A priest such as this one had nothing as means as resources, no weapons either.  Now, to take someone like him and put him in prison, whereas he is innocent, is not proper.  I do believe sincerely that he is innocent. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I believe Mr. Monthé will respond to your concerns as has been done with previous witnesses.  

Mr. Monthé, please.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Yes, Madam President, I thank you.  I think the problem is not -- is non-existent. We will take all of the necessary measure to ensure a meeting between the witness and Father Seromba.  This will be done under the protection of the relevant section, under normal conditions.  And other than that I know that the Tribunal has to do what job it will have to do with regard to the advice of the witness.  Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you still have got the floor; I don't know what is happening. 
THE WITNESS:
I do apologise. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We gave you the time to express yourself.  And Mr. Monthé has explained to you how things will develop.  And as I reminded you a moment ago, you have come to the end of your testimony and now you may leave the Court.  You may take leave of the Court.  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Madam President. 
(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Monthé, we want to know who will be the next witness at the bar.  It would seem that there are witnesses who are in the waiting room, next door.  Can you please tell us which would be the witness that you intend to take on now? 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, I don't know whether there are several witnesses.  I know that BZ8 was intended to be called this afternoon.  That's what I know. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are going to take the break right now.  I wanted to continue but I see that it is time for the break.  

Please registry, can you please ensure that the witness does not come in right now.

Are there any issues to be taken?  I saw the Prosecutor on her feet.  
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, we just wished to know, we have been told who are the witnesses who are presently in Arusha.  And if counsel can assist us with what is the order of the next set of witnesses we will be quite pleased.   
(Pages 1 to 19 by Donna M. Lewis)























1600H 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Monthé, can you provide some edification on the appearance of witnesses?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I'm not going to spend every afternoon reminding the Prosecution of the appearance order.  Maybe the Prosecution can be kind enough as to take it down each time we say the order.  And this afternoon we will have BZ8, and then we will have FE35 and FE36, CF14.  Unfortunately, FE36 is unwell, but I wouldn't be able to tell you much beyond these four, but we have for this afternoon BZ18 (sic) -- and this is what I explained to the Chamber yesterday -- BZ8, and I hope that I have been understood by those on the bench of the Prosecution. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Monthé, you said a moment ago that the order is BZ8, FE35, FE36, and CF14, I believe. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes.  That depends on the status of their health, and this is what I know for the time being. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This would be subject to the various health status (sic) of the witnesses, but the order is BZ8, FE35, FE36, and CF14.  So we shall take the break now, thank you.  Session stands adjourned.  
(Court recessed from 1604H to 1630H)
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Proceedings are resumed. 

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are Witness BZ8.  Very well.  You are a protected Defence witness, and it is because you are a protected witness that we call you BZ8.  The Defence is going to conduct an examination-in-chief of you, after which you will be cross-examined by the Office of the Prosecutor.  It is possible that the Judges also put questions to you.  It is also possible that the Defence conduct a re-examination of you.  Before you begin to answer the questions, we would ask you to take a solemn declaration.  
(Declaration made by Witness BZ8 in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Thank you, Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, as well. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nekuie or Mr. Monthé?  I see it's Mr. Monthé that is going to examine BZ8. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, with your leave, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Of course.  You have the floor, Counsel. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, Your Honours, I would like to begin my examination-in-chief of Witness BZ8.  
WITNESS BZ8,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness BZ8, good afternoon.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	I, with Barnabé Nekuie, represent Father Seromba.  We are going to ask you some very simple and specific questions and we ask that you respond them -- to them in the same way.  If ever you don't understand one of the questions, please ask me to rephrase it for you.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
I'm not certain whether or not the witness has understood what I just told him. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I've understood you. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
A.	Thank you, as well. 
Q.	Before I begin, I would like to hand you a document which contains some identification information.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
With your leave, Madam President, I would ask registry to assist me in handing the document to the witness. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness BZ8, do you have the identification sheet, which contains identification information about you, before you?  Can you tell the Chamber if the information contained in the document is correct, and confirm that there are no mistakes with regard to the information? 
A.	There are no mistakes on the identification sheet. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ8.  

MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President -- 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, as well. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, with your leave, I seek to tender this as a Defence Exhibit.  I believe this will be Exhibit D. 56.  If Mr. Fry could confirm that.  D. 55, Madam President.  Madam President, I request this document be tendered and placed under seal.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objection, Madam Prosecutor?  
MS. ALEXIS:
No objection, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The identification sheet for Witness BZ8 is tendered, admitted, and marked as the next Defence Exhibit and shall be marked D. 55 and placed under seal. 
 (Exhibit No. D. 55 admitted, under seal)
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness BZ8, could you kindly tell this Chamber where you were in April 1994?  Were you staying in Rwanda and, if so, in which location? 
A.	I lived at home in Kivumu commune. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You were at home in Kivumu commune in April 1994.  Can you tell us whether or not there were any exceptional or extraordinary events that occurred during that period? 
A.	On the 6th of April, there was an extraordinary event which occurred.  The presidential plane crashed; it was shot down.  It was extraordinary as an event. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ8.  
A.	Thank you, as well. 
Q.	The plane was shot down, you say, on the 6th of April.  Under which circumstances did you learn that the plane had been shot down? 
A.	I learned of the news by listening to Radio Rwanda.  I heard about it the day after the incident occurred. 
Q.	When you heard the news, how did you react, Witness BZ8? 
A.	For my part, I was disturbed.  I became afraid after hearing the news. 
Q.	At the same time, did you find out the reaction of your family members or neighbours? 
A.	Overall, you could see that everybody was sad because of the news, and we were afraid. 
Q.	You say, "We were afraid."  Are you thinking about you or the immediate surroundings in your area? 
A.	Personally, I could see that everybody was afraid.  That's what I observed at the time. 
Q.	You said that you observed that everyone was afraid; when did you begin to observe that?  Is there any particular date that you have in mind? 
A.	The day after the accident.  That was when I began to observe that. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ8.  So you could observe that everyone was afraid.  How would that fear translate in your area? 
A.	Looking at the situation closely, you could see that the people were not dealing with their daily agricultural activities.  You could see that people were not willing to go about them. 
Q.	You could see that, Witness?  What did the population -- what did, rather, the people do?  Did they stay home or did they start to gather into groups?  What could you see? 
A.	You could see that people stayed at home the day after the accident. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
A.	Thank you, sir. 
Q.	How long did people stay at home, starting on the day after the plane went down, according to you, Witness? 
A.	From what I could see, and let me mention a few dates -- all the same, I can't confirm whether or not those dates are exact.  Beginning on the 10th, people -- some people began to go to the communal office seeking refuge. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ8.  
A.	Thank you, sir. 
Q.	Witness BZ8, you say that some people went to seek refuge at the communal office.  Are you referring to any specific people?  Were you able to identify them, for example? 
A.	Are you asking me their names, Counsel?
Q.	No, I'm not asking you their names.  I'm asking if the people who went to the communal office seeking refuge belonged to any particular community or group.
A.	Some of them were wealthier than others, and they went to that place in vehicles. 
Q.	According to you, can you tell the Chamber which ethnic group the people you saw going to the communal office belonged to? 
A.	The people I'm talking about, the wealthy ones, were, for the most part, property owners, real estate owners.  It's that type of person that I'm talking about. 
Q.	Did you ask yourself, or did those around you ask themselves why, in fact, those people were going to the communal office seeking refuge? 
A.	Yes.  They went there to seek refuge. 
Q.	But did you know why? 
A.	In fact, tension began to grow among the people. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ8.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel. 
Q.	You said that tension began to grow amongst the people.  Did it materialise and manifest itself with any particular event, Witness? 
A.	You could see that there was tension, because you could see people moving about.  They were not calm. 
Q.	Did you witness any violence at that time, Witness? 
A.	Not at that time.  You couldn't see any.  But there were rumours going around amongst the people.  Aside from those rumours, you couldn't see or witness any violence at the time. 
Q.	At that time, Witness, in other words, around the 10th of April, was that the situation? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Thank you, BZ8.  If you know, Witness, tell us under which circumstances those people went to the communal office.  Do you believe, for example, that they were brought there by force? 
A.	No.  Those people went there voluntarily. 
Q.	Thank you.  You could see those people go there voluntarily.  Where did you see them from?  Where were you exactly on around the 10th of April?
A.	Around that date I had a shop.  It was close to the road.  That's where I had my business and that's where I was. 
Q.	Thank you.  Just so that we don't have to go back over this, was your shop near the trading centre, or was it close to the parish?  Can you be more specific and elaborate for us? 
A.	From Nyange centre to where my shop was located, there was a distance of about one kilometre; that's, of course, if you took the road. 
Q.	Thank you, BZ8.  Later on, were you able to notice whether those people, who were at the communal office, left to go somewhere else? 
A.	Yes.  Later those people went to the church itself to seek refuge. 
Q.	Witness, you said that those people went to the church seeking refuge.  Which church are you referring to? 
A.	It's the church at the Nyange Catholic parish. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ8.  Do you have an idea of the date when those people began to go to Nyange church? 
A.	I don't remember the date. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ8.  I want to stop now and talk a bit about Nyange church.  Were you a regular at that church, Witness? 
A.	Yes.  I knew the place. 
Q.	Did you go there on a regular basis? 
A.	I did.  I was baptised there. 
Q.	Must I, therefore, conclude that you are a Catholic? 
A.	I am. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ8.  You were baptised at Nyange church.  Do you have any idea of the name of the priest at Nyange church at the time the events occurred in April 1994? 
A.	I don't understand.  Can you repeat your question for me?
Q.	Yes, I can.  This was my question:   Since you were familiar with Nyange church, I asked you if you remember the name of the priest at Nyange church in the period -- during the period of concern to us today, in other words, April 1994.  
A.	Yes, it was Father Straton. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ8.  During that time, was Father Straton the only priest you could see at Nyange church, or did you see some other ones? 
A.	Father Athanase Seromba was also there. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  During that period, did you ever have an opportunity to meet Father Athanase Seromba at Nyange parish? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did you ever meet him at a later stage? 
A.	No. 
Q.	So, when you -- rather, when those people began to arrive at Nyange church, as you said, on which day approximately was it? 
A.	I don't remember which day. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  According to you, how long did those refugees stay at Nyange parish? 
A.	From when, Counsel?
Q.	From the time you saw the refugees move to the parish.  How long did they stay at Nyange parish, if you know, of course? 
A.	I don't recall.  It's been a long time.  I don't remember. 
Q.	Thank you.  Tell me, Witness, were you personally in a position to know how those refugees were received at Nyange parish? 
A.	They were well received.  When they arrived, no one sent them away from that place. 
Q.	Witness, did you learn about this later on, or did you learn of that at the time, yourself? 
A.	I learned about this later on. 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness BZ8, tell me, under which circumstances did the refugees take shelter at the church; do you know, for example, if they were subject to any attacks at any stage? 
A.	There were attacks on those refugees. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Do you have any idea on which date or dates those attacks may have taken place? 
A.	I'll give you the dates, but let me point out that they are estimates.  I believe that the first attack took place on the 13th. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Tell me, did you know who the attackers were? 
A.	No, I don't know them. 
Q.	Were you able to determine if those people were from your commune or a neighbouring commune? 
A.	They were people from all over. 
Q.	Witness BZ8, can you tell the Chamber if you were able to know why those refugees at Nyange church were being attacked from people who were from all over? 
A.	I don't know why those attackers did what they did. 
Q.	Let's get back to the 13th of April, Witness, and you told us you were not certain about the date, but you think that was the date the first attack took place, is that correct? 
A.	That's what I believe, yes. 
Q.	Thank you for that clarification, Witness.  Did you see that attack take place, Witness? 
A.	Yes, I was there. 
Q.	Thank you.  Do you remember the circumstances surrounding the attack? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Could you kindly tell the Chamber under which circumstances the attack of the 13th of April took place? 
A.	Hutus organised themselves.  They came from all over.  They went up to the parish.  Once they arrived on site, the refugees, who were inside the church, pushed them back.  The attackers turned around and went in the direction of the commercial centre. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Let us stay on this date of the 13th that you mentioned.  On the 13th of April at that time, do you know whether or not there was still Mass given at the church? 
A.	Not inside the church.  We could not celebrate Mass anymore. 
Q.	Thank you for that clarification, BZ8.  At that time, when the first attack took place, were you able to know or learn whether or not Father Straton, the priest of the church, was there? 
A.	No, he was not present. 
Q.	Thank you.  So you saw the first attack on the 13th of April; the refugees were attacked, and they defended themselves; is that what you said? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	Very well.  That means they resisted the attack of those who were after them? 
A.	Yes.  They resisted the attackers. 
Q.	On the 13th of April, the refugees resisted the attackers.  Where exactly were you between the church and the commercial centre that you talked about a little earlier? 
A.	I was at the centre, but I moved around.  I didn't stay in one place. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ8.  You said that you had a shop, is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	During the time of the event that you are describing for the Chamber took place, what became of your shop; did you still open it for business? 
A.	Beginning on which date, Counsel?
Q.	Well, we're already on the 13th of April.  You mentioned the first attack on that date.  I want to know between the 7th -- well, rather, the 10th of April, to take into account what you're saying, from the 10th of April, were you still doing business at your shop?  
A.	Well, given the insecurity at the time, I had to close down the shop.  I brought the items I would sell back home with me. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  So you weren't able to tend to your shop, were you? 
A.	I closed the shop down because there was insecurity. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  So on the 13th of April, you witnessed an attack.  On that date, when the attack took place, were there many people at the parish, or were there few people?  Tell us to the best of your recollection, Witness. 
A.	Are you talking about the attackers or the refugees?
Q.	Let's talk first about the attackers, and later on we'll get to the refugees, if, of course, you have an idea of how many people may have been there on the 13th of April.
A.	The attackers were few in relation to the refugees, but I wouldn't be able to tell you how many there were. 
Q.	Thank you.  Tell me, you testified that some attackers came from close by and you said they came from everywhere.  Can you indicate to the Chamber where exactly they came from?  From which locations? 
A.	There were some who came from communes that were neighbouring ours. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, on the 13th of April, can you help the Chamber understand under what circumstances the attack came to an end, if you recall? 
A.	The attackers launched an attack.  The refugees defended themselves, and the attackers realised their defeat by the refugees, and they launched a new attack, or fresh one, on the next day. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ8.  Now, let's come now to the attack on the following day.  When, as you say, the refugees defeated the attackers, what did they do?  Did they come back to the church or did they go elsewhere? 
A.	The refugees went back to the church. 
Q.	Witness BZ8, do you recall under what circumstances these refugees went back into the church on that day, in other words, after the attack that took place on the 13th? 
A.	From -- of their own initiative, the refugees went back into the church.  No one forced them to do so. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ8.  During the attack of the 13th which you have just described, were you able to notice whether there were any victims among the refugees? 
A.	No, none. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, what about the 14th of April; was there a new attack? 
A.	Yes.  There was a new attack. 
Q.	Witness BZ8, I don't want to bother you too much with the times and questions of that kind, but do you recall approximately what time of day that attack may have taken place? 
A.	It was not in the morning, nor was it in the evening.  It was during a period of time between the two. 
Q.	Can one consider that it was in the beginning or the afternoon? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Very well.  Now, we are on the 14th.  What did you see?  Did you see the attackers come to and assault the church?  Please describe to us what you saw.  
A.	The attackers went up towards the church and, when they got there, the refugees came out and defended themselves, as they had done on the first occasion.  But since the attackers in the second attack were more in number, they were much stronger as a force than the refugees. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ8.  So what did you see on that day?  Since the attackers were stronger than the refugees, what did you see?  Can you please describe the scene to us? 
A.	What showed me that the attackers were stronger is that there were victims, and the refugees realised their weakness in the face of the attackers, and the refugees decided to go back into the church, and they locked themselves in the church. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ8.  At that point in time, during that second attack on the 14th, were you able to tell whether there were any victims amongst the refugees? 
A.	Yes, there were victims among the refugees. 
Q.	Tell me, Witness BZ8, the 13th and 14th of April, when those two first attacks occurred, did you see any policemen or gendarmes at the parish? 
A.	I saw policemen there. 
Q.	Were they armed and, if so, what were they doing? 
A.	The policemen were armed. 
Q.	Witness BZ8, did you get the impression, when you were looking at those policemen, that they were there to ensure the security and safety of the parish at that particular time? 
A.	On what date, Counsel?
Q.	I am referring to the 13th and 14th of April 1994, and my question was as follows, if you didn't quite understand it:   Did you see policemen there and were they armed and, in your opinion, were they there for the safety and security of the people who were there? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ8.  Let's come back to the date of the 14th of April.  You stated that the attackers were more in number on that day.  Now, the attackers that you saw, were they armed on that day? 
A.	They were carrying traditional weapons. 
Q.	Thank you.  When you refer to "traditional weapons", can you be a bit more specific? 
A.	There were spears, machetes, clubs. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ8.  When the refugees were defending themselves against the attackers, with what were they defending themselves, if you know? 
A.	The refugees were using stones in order to protect themselves or defend themselves. 
Q.	After the attack of the 14th of April 1994, during which you say the attackers were more in number, what did the refugees do, if you recall? 
A.	Having realised that they'd lost, the refugees barricaded themselves inside the church. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness BZ8.  But, I'm sorry, I'm having to come back to this word "barricaded".  Did they lock themselves in the church, or did they lock themselves out of the church? 
A.	They barricaded themselves inside the church and they, themselves, did that. 
Q.	Thank you for that clarification.  According to you, when they barricaded themselves inside the church, were they trying to avoid having the attackers get the upper hand? 
A.	They barricaded themselves inside the church in order to escape from the attackers, who could have cut them up with bladed weapons. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  If you know, I would like you to tell us now why the attackers came in such great numbers to the church in order to attack the refugees.  
A.	They say -- they came in large numbers because, during the first attack, the attackers had been repelled and they had been overcome. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ8.  Now, please, let's go back to the armed policemen that you saw.  Do you remember whether those policemen used their weapons or not? 
A.	Yes.  Those policemen used their weapons. 
Q.	Do you recall who were the targets of the policemen when they used their weapons? 
A.	They used their weapons to shoot at the refugees. 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness BZ8, how did the attack of the 14th of April end once the refugees had barricaded themselves inside the church?  What did the attackers do? 
A.	After the refugees barricaded themselves inside the church, some moments later I saw a machine, and I'm referring to those machines which are used when roads are being built.  That machine began to destroy the church. 
Q.	For us to be better in the clear, did the machine that you saw -- was seen by you on the same day, in other words, the day on which the refugees barricaded themselves inside the church, can you be a bit clearer on that point? 
A.	The machine came on the same day. 
Q.	Do you recall, Witness, whether, when the machine arrived, a great deal of time had already gone by since you had been at the parish? 
A.	I didn't quite understand your question, Counsel. 
Q.	I'm so sorry.  I'll reformulate my question.  What I wanted to ask you was -- whether the time between the machine or the bulldozer -- but we'll stick to "machine" because that was your term -- had you been at the parish for a long time? 
A.	Yes, I was there, and all these events took place while I was there, in my presence. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ8.  Do you know whether, when the engine arrived at the parish, there were many people, in your opinion? 
A.	There were many people. 
Q.	Witness BZ8, can you please tell us, if you know, under what circumstances the engine was brought to the parish? 
A.	I don't know under what circumstances the machine was brought to the parish, and I do not know either who brought it there. 
Q.	Thank you.  In your opinion, when you saw that machine arrive, did you know whether it had come there to destroy the church or for some other purpose? 
A.	I do not know why that machine had been brought there. 
Q.	Did you see one or several machines, Witness BZ8? 
A.	I only saw one. 
Q.	When the machine arrived at the parish, Witness BZ8, where were you at that precise moment? 
A.	I was in the area, but I was looking on somewhat from a distance. 
Q.	Thank you.  For how long did the machine remain at the parish, if you know? 
A.	Are you referring to days or hours?
Q.	Did it remain there for several days? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Tell me, Witness BZ8, did you personally witness the destruction of the church? 
A.	I was present. 
Q.	Do you recall, Witness, how the church was destroyed? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Can you explain to the Chamber the circumstances of the destruction of the church which you say you saw? 
A.	That machine arrived and it began to destroy the church from the back walls. 
Q.	When you say "by the back walls", you mean the walls which are in the opposite direction to the façade of the church, or the front? 
A.	Yes, quite so. 
Q.	Thank you.  So here you are, you're watching the destruction; was that destruction done only on one occasion, or in one space of time? 
A.	No.  If my memory serves me right, the destruction did not take place only once. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ8.  Tell me now, when the church was being destroyed, did you observe the reaction of the people who were standing around watching the destruction of the church?  What was their reaction, if you recall? 
A.	Which people are you referring to?
Q.	You had told me that, when a machine arrived, there were many people at the parish, is that correct? 
A.	Yes, there were people there. 
Q.	Thank you.  So what I want to know is this:  Given what you have said, what was the reaction of those people who were watching the destruction of the church; did they approve of what was happening, or did they disapprove?  Could you please tell us? 
A.	I couldn't well say that everybody approved the destruction of the church.  Personally, I didn't approve the destruction of the church.  But I do not know what was the feeling of the other people in this regard. 
Q.	Tell me, the one who was destroying the church, did you see the person or persons?  Was it only one person in the caterpillar or were there several? 
A.	I couldn't quite see that person. 
Q.	During that destruction of the church, from the time the destruction began, what were the refugees doing? 
A.	Some refugees were defending themselves by throwing stones. 
Q.	Witness BZ8, if I were to ask you about the specific moment when the church was being destroyed, where exactly you were standing in relation to the church, would you be able to remember? 
A.	Yes.  Yes, I do.  I do remember. 
Q.	Could you kindly tell us approximately how far you were from the church which was being destroyed, where you were standing and where the church was, approximately speaking? 
A.	I was on the side towards the trading centre.  I was not close to the church; however, I could see what was happening there.

1730H 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Can you tell me in what capacity you were there as the church was being destroyed? 
A.	I was there as a spectator.  You see, when there is an event occurring, curious people, onlookers come to see what is happening.  Otherwise, I didn't have any specific purpose.  I was merely observing what was happening there. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ8.  At that specific moment of the destruction of the church, were there other onlookers with you? 
A.	Yes, there were people who had not come to the place in order to be involved in the confrontation, people who had just come there to see what was happening.
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ8.  Were you able to recognise some of these onlookers?  Would you say that they were people from your commune? 
A.	No, I wasn't able to identify any of these people by name. 
Q.	Let's now get back to the destruction of the church.  So you were standing there as a spectator, an onlooker?  Does that mean that it was only your curiosity that brought you there, or was there any other reason? 
A.	I was there as an onlooker only.  There was no other reason for my presence there. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ8.  So, the church begins to get destroyed by the walls at the back and you know what was happening because you were there.  Now, can you help the Chamber by describing to the Chamber what you saw? 
A.	The destruction began with the back walls, but the whole church did not collapse immediately because there was the bell tower which was still standing. 
Q.	Thank you.  So when the destruction began, did the bell tower remain standing alone, or was there also part of the church still standing? 
A.	It was only the bell tower which was still standing. 
Q.	Witness BZ8, do you remember when the bell tower remained standing on that day?  Was it already the end of the afternoon by then? 
A.	Yes, in fact, it was in the afternoon. 
Q.	Do you recall what happened when the bell tower remained standing?  Did the destruction continue, or did it come to an end?
A.	The destruction was not interrupted.  It continued, and the bell tower came down on the following day. 
Q.	I don't think you quite understood my question.  Did the clock tower -- did the bell tower follow on the same day as the day on which the destruction itself began? 
A.	As far as I know, and according to what remember, I believe the bell tower fell the next day. 
Q.	Very well.  So that means that the bell tower remained standing throughout the night? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ8.  At that point in time, did you remain in the vicinity of the parish, or did you go back home? 
A.	That evening, I went back home. 
Q.	Witness BZ8, when you went back home, do you remember whether in the vicinity of the parish there were still a lot of people present? 
A.	Some of people remained in that location. 
Q.	Witness BZ8, when you say some people remained there, are you referring to the attackers, the onlookers, or the refugees? 
A.	I am referring to the attackers. 
Q.	Thank you for that clarification, Witness.  Did you ever get to know why the said assailants remained where they were? 
A.	I didn't get to know clearly why, but I believe they remained in that place because the refugees were still in the bell tower. 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness BZ8, did you personally witness the tower being destroyed the following day? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And at about what time did you come back to the parish the next day, since you returned home the previous night? 
A.	I returned in the morning.  
Q.	Do you have any idea what time it was?  Was it noon or later? 
A.	It was before noon, but I don't recall exactly what time it was. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Tell us, when you arrived at the parish before midday, were there still as many attackers surrounding the church? 
A.	They were still there. 
Q.	Tell me BZ8 tell the Chamber, what attracted you so much that you would come back to the church the next day even? 
A.	I had gone to see what was going on.  I was there as a spectator, if you will. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  So you came back to the church the next day before noon, and you saw the attackers.  At that time, what were they doing according to you? 
A.	Are you talking about the day when the tower was destroyed? 
Q.	I am talking about the day when you came back when the tower was still standing.  If you don't understand, I will repeat it for you.  
A.	Please do so. 
Q.	Of course.  I will, Witness.  This was my question:  You returned to the church the next day; the tower was still standing.  There were still some assailants surrounding the tower.  You said that it was before noon.  What were the assailants doing? 
A.	They were guarding the tower. 
Q.	Witness BZ8, were you able to see whether or not at that time there were any refugees inside the tower? 
A.	There were some refugees inside the tower at that time. 
Q.	Than you for that qualification, Witness.  Tell me, when you arrived, the church had already been destroyed and only the tower was standing.  Were the victims around?  Were their dead bodies lying on the ground?  Describe for us, if you can, the scene.  
A.	Yes, there were some dead bodies. 
Q.	According to you, were there many of them or few? 
A.	There were many.
Q.	Tell me, Witness, you saw the attackers bearing traditional weapons, according to you, had they organised themselves to come to Nyange church?  
A.	No, I never saw such organisation on the part of those attackers.  I only witnessed their arrival. 
Q.	Witness BZ8, did you have the impression that they had a leader or that there was someone behind their organisation or someone who led them? 
A.	I was able to identify the criminal investigations officer called Kayishema.  I was able to identify that person on site. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ8.  You identified that person on site.  Do you remember at the time what that person was doing? 
A.	I could see him standing on site.  He was the only authority that I was able to identify on site. 
Q.	Witness BZ8, you said that you could see him standing on site.  Was he giving advice?  Was he giving orders?  How was he acting?  What exactly was he doing? 
A.	Since I didn't stay in one place all the time, I wasn't able to follow closely what that man was doing.  As such, I can't give you any details. 
Q.	Thank you, BZ8.  Let's now go back to our discussion about the tower.  The tower is still standing.  You personally saw the tower being destroyed; is that correct? 
A.	I was there, yes. 
Q.	Thank you.  Given that, BZ8, could you be so kind as to describe for the benefit of the Chamber the circumstances under which the tower, according to you, came down? 
A.	It was destroyed by means of a machine.
Q.	Thank you.  May I ask you, Witness, I know that this may be difficult for you since it has been a long time, but between the time you arrived at the parish and the time the tower was destroyed, at the time the tower came down before you, how much time went by?  Please answer if you are in a position to do so. 
A.	I don't remember exactly how many minutes went by, but it wasn't long after I arrived on site. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  So the tower came down and you were there, weren't you? 
A.	Yes, I was there.  
Q.	Thank you.  What did the machine or piece of equipment do after the tower came down? 
A.	Once the tower came down, the piece of equipment had finished the job.  I didn't see anything else being done using that equipment. 
Q.	Thank you, BZ8.  In that regard, tell us, were you able to see the reaction of the onlookers, of the assailants at the moment the tower came down, as you said? 
A.	When the attackers saw the tower come down, they made an attempt to finish off anyone who attempted to flee from the site. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness BZ8, you were in that location, and you moved around the 
	commercial centre and at the church.  In that location, do you remember whether or not any roadblocks were put up?  
A.	Not at that time, there weren't any. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did you learn that any roadblocks were set up anywhere in the vicinity of the parish, or, rather, away from the parish?  
A.	No, I have no information in that regard. 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness BZ8, were you able to know if during the destruction of Nyange church, there were any clergy members, priests, on site? 
A.	Father Athanase Seromba was the only one there.  However, when the church was being destroyed, he was not in that specific place.  When the church came down, I didn't see him.  What I do know is that he was the only one, the only priest, who lived at the parish at the time. 
Q.	If I were to ask you to give me - - if I were to give you some names of some clergy members and ask you whether or not you know them, could you do that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did you ever hear of John François Emmanuel Kayiranga? 
A.	No, I don't remember that name. 
Q.	What about Edward Nturiye?  Does that ring a bell for you, Witness BZ8? 
A.	That one I know; I know Nturiye. 
Q.	Were you able to know whether he was on site on the day Nyange church was destroyed? 
MS. ALEXIS:
Your Honour, I must object - - is counsel cross-examining his own witness?  The witness has said very specifically, he was asked and I am taking down the evidence in question - and - answer form.  He was asked, "During the destruction of the church, were any clergymen on site?"  He said, 
"Father Athanase Seromba was the only one there, although I didn't see him at this specific place when the church was being destroyed." 

So the witness has already answered this question.  Counsel may not, in my view, ask questions about other clergymen who were there when the witness clearly said that only Athanase Seromba was there. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President? 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Counsel? 
MR. MONTHÉ:
I don't believe that we should blame it in translation, as we did yesterday.  My question was the following:  I asked the witness if I would give him some names of clergy members if he could tell me whether or not he knows them.  That was the question.  I asked him if he knew Kayiranga.  He said no.  I asked him if he knew Father Nturiye.  He said, "Yes, that one I know."  "Was he on site?"  I don't see what the problem is, Madam Prosecutor, with that.  I don't see what the problem with that question is: It's completely coherent.  It doesn't seem to be up for debate. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Counsel. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness BZ8, I was asking you a question about Father Nturiye when we were interrupted.  Let me repeat the question for you.  You told the Chamber that you knew Father Edward Nturiye; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I know him. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did you learn whether or not he was on site that time? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Thank you, BZ8.  If I were to talk to you about Balthazar Habimana, would the priest's name ring a bell for you, Witness? 
A.	No, I don't remember that one.
Q.	Thank you, BZ8.  Now, let me ask you the following:  It has been said that many Tutsi refugees died at the church.  Did you know any of them?  Did you hear any of the names of the Tutsi victims who died at the church? 
A.	Yes.  After the church was destroyed, I never went back to that place.
Q.	Thank you.  Tell me, you saw the violence in your commune.  You are talking about that violence here today which occurred in Nyange.  Were the Tutsis the persons being attacked? 
A.	Yes, the Tutsi were the ones being attacked at the time. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Please tell us, with regard to those Tutsis who were targeted, was it a specific category of Tutsis who were being targeted because of their social status or category or was it Tutsis in general who were being targeted? 
A.	At that time, there was no distinction made amongst the Tutsis.  All of the Tutsis died. 
Q.	Thank you.  Thank you for the clarification, BZ8.  BZ8, are you Hutu? 
A.	I am, yes. 
Q.	Thank you.  Can you tell the Chamber if you come before this Chamber to give testimony simply because of the fact that you are a Hutu? 
A.	Pardon me, I didn't understand that question. 
Q.	Let me repeat it for you, BZ8.  I asked you if you were a Hutu; you said, "Yes, I am."  Is that correct? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	The next question was this one:  Have you come to give testimony before this Chamber simply because of the fact that you are Hutu?  That's my question.
A.	No.  I come before this Chamber essentially to talk about the events that I witnessed and to talk about the events that I am aware of. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness BZ8, did you ever learn whether or not anyone gave the order for your church to be destroyed?  Did you ever learn anything like that? 
A.	No, I never heard such a thing. 
Q.	You said that you never heard such a thing.  Does that mean that, according to you, the order to destroy the church was never given? 
A.	I heard no order. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness BZ8, once the tower fell down, what did you do? 
A.	Since I was a Christian believer who prayed at that church, the incident saddened me a great deal. 
Q.	Yes, you were saddened by the events, but when did you leave?  Did you leave?  What exactly did you do?  
A.	I left that location and went home.  Therefore, I don't know what happened after I left. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, Your Honours, I still have a few questions, and I see that it may be time to break.  I would kindly request the Chamber to respect our normal calendar and ask that we stop here. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We are going to adjourn these proceedings, and we shall resume tomorrow at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, at which time we will continue with the examination of this witness.  

Witness, you are going to withdraw from the Chamber now, and tomorrow you will appear again before this Chamber, at which time you will continue to answer the questions put to you by the Defence. Witness, we should like to remind you that you are still under oath, and, as such, you shall not talk about your testimony with anyone outside of this courtroom.  Do you understand that, Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understand, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well. These proceedings are adjourned.
 (Court adjourned at 1804H)
