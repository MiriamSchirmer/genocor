        13     MADAM PRESIDENT:

        14                    What is your title, Mr. Seromba?

        15     THE ACCUSED:

        16                    I don't understand.

        17     MADAM PRESIDENT:

        18                    I said, what is your title.  How should we 

        19                    address you?  As mister, or do you have a 

        20                    priestly title. 

        21                    

        22                    All right.  So we'll call you mister then. 

        23     THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:

        24                    Madam President, the Accused may not have 

        25                    heard what you said.

         9                    of this special session is to afford you an

         1                    indictment and whether it's been served on 

         2                    the Accused, that kind of thing.

         3     MS. ARBIA:

         4                    Yes, Madam President.  This indictment was 

         5                    confirmed on the 20th of -- 3rd of July 

         6                    2001, and it was filed on the 20th of June 

         7                    2001.  It was served on the Accused on the 

         8                    6th of February 2002.

         9     MADAM PRESIDENT:

        10                    In a language that he understands?

        11     MS. ARBIA:

        12                    Yes; yes, in a language he understands.

        13     MADAM PRESIDENT:

        14                    Mr. Kiritta. 

        15     MR. KIRITTA:

        16                    I believe we are here this afternoon to take 

        17                    the plea of the suspect and I believe he's 

        18                    ready to have that plea taken.

        19     MADAM PRESIDENT:

        20                    Thank you, Mr. Kiritta.  You've helped your 

        21                    client to read and understand the 

        22                    indictment, and are you satisfied that the 

        23                    Accused understood the indictment.

        24     MR. KIRITTA:

        25                    He does understand the indictment,

         1                    Your Honour.  And I hope it is the one that 

         2                    was served on him Friday night -- Wednesday 

         3                    night.  Is that the same one or have there 

         4                    been changes?

         5     MADAM PRESIDENT:

         6                    Well, let's verify.

         7     MS. ARBIA:

         8                    There has been no amendment.  It's the same 

         9                    indictment that was served on the Accused.

        10     MADAM PRESIDENT:

        11                    Well, it's dated the 8th of June.

        12     MS. ARBIA:

        13                    The indictment is dated 10th June, but was 

        14                    filed on the 20th of June.

        15     MADAM PRESIDENT:

        16                    Well, that's a nice point to begin with.  

        17                    I'm looking at the English version, signed 

        18                    by Madam Del Ponte, and it's dated 8th of 

        19                    June.  So Mr. Kiritta is right.  Have you 

        20                    served the correct indictment on the 

        21                    Accused?  Did you make amendments to this 

        22                    initial indictment after the confirmation 

        23                    order, Ms. Arbia?

        24     MS. ARBIA:

        25                    No, no amendments, Madam President; no

         1                    amendments whatsoever.

         2     MADAM PRESIDENT:

         3                    So it seems then, Mr. Kiritta, the 

         4                    Prosecutor shows us that it is, in fact, the 

         5                    indictment confirmed by the confirming 

         6                    judge, Judge Williams. 

         7     MR. KIRITTA:

         8                    That's all right, Madam President.

         9     MADAM PRESIDENT:

        10                    Thank you for raising that because this does 

        11                    raise complications sometimes.

        12     MR. KIRITTA:

        13                    It does quite a few times, yes.

        14     MADAM PRESIDENT:

        15                    Father Seromba, Athanase, may I call you to 

        16                    come forward here because I wish to put the 

        17                    indictment to you and record your plea.  

        18                    (Witness complies)

        19     THE ACCUSED:

        20                    My name is Seromba, Athanase.

        21     MADAM PRESIDENT:

        22                    Mr. Seromba, you may be seated and I'll 

        23                    indicate -

         1     MADAM PRESIDENT:

         2                    -- when you will be standing.  So, firstly, 

         3                    I see that you would like to speak in 

         4                    French.

         5     THE ACCUSED:

         6                    Yes.

         7     MADAM PRESIDENT:

         8                    All right.  Now you can be seated.  Please 

         9                    give us your full name, and if you are known 

        10                    by any other names, give us those, too.

        11     THE ACCUSED:

        12                    I have said that I am Father Athanase

        20                    humanity.  How do you plead to count 4?

        21     THE ACCUSED:

        22                    I plead not guilty.

        23     MADAM PRESIDENT:

        24                    Thank you.  You may be seated.

          SEROMBA                                          8 FEBRUARY 2002



         1                    I have recorded your pleas of not guilty on 

         2                    all four counts.  I'd like to inform you 

         3                    that in terms of the Statute and Rules of 

         4                    this Tribunal, you are presumed innocent of 

         5                    these charges unless or until your guilt is 

         6                    proven beyond all reasonable doubt by the 

         7                    Prosecutor. 

         8                    

         9                    Now, your counsel, Mr. Kiritta, would have 

        10                    explained to you all your rights.  But I 

        11                    just wish to very briefly inform you of a 

        12                    few of them.  And one is that this Tribunal 

        13                    will, in terms of its Rules of Evidence and 

        14                    Procedure, give you a fair trial.  One of 

        15                    the rights you have is to appoint counsel of 

        16                    your choice.  If you are indigent, you may 

        17                    apply to the Registrar for appointment of 

        18                    counsel whose names appear on the list 

        19                    maintained by the Registrar. 

        20                    

        21                    I see that the indictment and the warrant of 

        22                    arrest was served on you on the 6th February 

        23                    here in Arusha.  Is it the position, then, 

        24                    that you came to the Tribunal and 

        25                    surrendered yourself?

         1     THE ACCUSED:

         2                    Yes.

         3     MADAM PRESIDENT:

         4                    Well, either Mr. Kiritta, your duty counsel, 

         5                    or your counsel once appointed, or once your 

         6                    own counsel comes on board will inform you 

         7                    of the further proceedings in this matter 

         8                    and the process that we go through before a 

         9                    trial date is fixed. 

        10                    

        11                    Do you wish to say anything before I ask you 

        12                    to return to your seat?

        13     THE ACCUSED:

        14                    Yes.  I was going to tell you that I already 

        15                    have counsel, but he is not present here 

        16                    today.  I came with the duty counsel.  But I 

        17                    already have counsel.

        18     MADAM PRESIDENT:

        19                    Yes.  That will go on record.  Thank you. 

        20                    

        21                    Can you please escort Father Seromba back to 

        22                    his seat. 

        23                    

        24                    This concludes the initial appearance 

        25                    proceedings and I would like, on behalf of

         1                    the Tribunal, to thank Mr. Kiritta for once 

         2                    again coming to the aid of accused persons 

         3                    at very short notice and for making an 

         4                    appearance today. 

         5     MR. KIRITTA:

         6                    Thank you, Madam President.

         7     MADAM PRESIDENT:

         8                    I'd also like to thank the interpreters and 

         9                    the court reports and the technicians 

        10                    because this team attached to this court has 

        11                    been working from 8:45 a.m. this morning, 

        12                    and they haven't complained, and that makes 

        13                    me nervous.  So I'd like to thank all of 

        14                    you, and this session now comes to an end.  

        15                    

        16                    Ms. Arbia, do you have anything to say?

        17     MS. ARBIA:

        18                    I have no comment to make.  I thank you.

        19     MADAM PRESIDENT:

        20                    All right.  In that case, I'll bring this 

        21                    session to a close. 

        22                    (Court adjourned at 1402H)

        23
