MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is now in session.  Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. 

There is a hum in the earsets.  Perhaps the technicians could assist us in solving this problem.
MR. MONTHÉ:
(No interpretation)
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
I believe Defence counsel is saying they are not receiving any sound at all.  No sound at all.  Could the technicians assist us? 

Is it better?  Counsel Monthé, can you hear me? 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, Madam President.  I can hear you.  There is still a little bit of a hum, though. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution.
MS. ARBIA:
I have a problem.  Unfortunately, I've tried all the earsets here, but the problem has not been solved. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We shall start in spite of the difficulties we are experiencing.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, the buzz is so strong that I am not sure we can follow the proceedings.  We shouldn't leave here with hearing disorders.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Try to reduce the volume.  Maybe in so doing, you can get rid of the buzz.  We shall also try to move the earsets a bit.  Maybe it will solve the problem.  

Counsel for the Prosecution, you have the floor.
MS. ARBIA:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours. 

The next prosecution witness is Mr. Materassi, Massimo.  He will speak in Spanish.  I would like to make sure that all arrangements for interpretation from that language and into that language have been made. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The interpreters, is everything in place? 

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, the interpreters are here, and they should be interpreting into Spanish.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So usher in the witness, please.  (No interpretation)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, we cannot hear you because your microphone is not lit.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
Could you please tell us who you are? 
THE WITNESS:  
I am Massimo Materassi.  I was born in Florence on the 18th of November 1975.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(No interpretation)
MS. ARBIA:

MASSIMO MATERASSI,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MS. ARBIA:  
Q.	Monsieur Materassi, bonjour.
A.	Good morning.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the English interpreter cannot hear the counsel for the Prosecution.
BY MS. ARBIA:  
Q.	Witness, wait for my questions to be put to you in their entirety before responding.  Agreed? 
A.	Yes.  I agree. 
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Materassi, what is your occupation? 
A.	I work in the Florence immigration office as a police officer in Florence prefecture. 
Q.	What are your current duties? 
A.	I work in the office in charge of studying the files of foreigners who want to have their situation regularised. 
Q.	For how long have you been working in that capacity? 
A.	I have been working there since January 1995. 
Q.	Could you please briefly state what the jurisdiction of your office is?
A.	That office issues residence permits to foreigners so that they may live in Italy in a lawful manner, but it also regularises the situation of persons who are formerly without papers.
Q.	Are you conversant with procedures regarding immigration into Italy by foreigners? 
A.	Yes, I am familiar with the procedure.
Q.	Can you briefly describe that procedure to the Chamber? 
A.	Generally, foreigners seeking residence permits file their documents or their applications, and we issue the permits to them if their file is okay. 
Q.	What reasons account for the admission of residence permits in Italy? 
A.	As a general rule, foreigners file documents, and the government of Italy issues the authorisation, which can take the form of a visa or a permit.  Subsequently, the person concerned brings his passport to us or his health insurance document, if he has one.
Q.	In what case can the residence permits be issued, be granted? 
A.	The foreigner should have a valid passport.  He should have the authorisation of the government, which generally takes the form of a visa, as I stated.  This visa is issued by the country of origin, as well as the health insurance, and he should show proof of economic means to obtain the residence permit.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:    
Madam President, the beginning of that question was not heard by the English interpreter.

So, Madam Prosecutor, could you repeat your question? 
BY MS. ARBIA:  
Q.	What do you mean?  I do not quite understand you.  How can the issue of the permit be justified in one way or the other?
A.	Yes.  Each residence permit has to be justified.  There are many categories of residence permits.  It always depends on the foreign national requesting it. 
Q.	Could you give us a few categories as examples? 
A.	We have the work permit, the medical assistance permit, family visit permit, studies permit, and other permits issued for religious reasons and others.
Q.	What is required for the issue of a residence permit for religious reasons?
A.	Are you referring to conditions? 
MR. POGNON:
(No interpretation)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
Madam President, the interpreters cannot hear the counsel for the Defence. 
MS. ARBIA:
I will repeat the question.  
BY MS. ARBIA:  
Q.	What are the specific requirements for the issue of residence papers on religious grounds? 
A.	As a general rule, in order to have a residence permit issued for those reasons, you need a valid passport, a visa, reasons given by the Italian embassy in the country of origin of the applicant.  Then you need a letter from the congregation of origin of the person concerned, health insurance, and nothing else. 
Q.	What procedure is applicable in Italy for the issue of a residence permit on religious grounds in Italy? 
A.	(No interpretation)
MS. ARBIA:
With your leave, Madam President, I would like the technician to put on the screen, for the interest of the witness, the Exhibit P. 15 or P. 6.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could the registrar bring out the exhibit P. 6, Prosecution Exhibit P. 6? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam Prosecutor, could you please observe a pause before asking your questions because we do not get the beginning of your questions.  

The interpreters would appreciate if Madam President could tell counsel for the Prosecution to observe a pause.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Counsel for the Defence says there's a problem with their screen. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We still do not have the document on our screens.  If the technicians can help us with this?  It's coming.  It's gone off again.  

Madam Prosecutor, it would seem that you do not give enough space between the witness's answer and your following question, so we are going to ask you to speak a little more slowly for the benefit of the interpreters.
MS. ARBIA:
Thank you.  Madam President, Your Honours, if there are technical reasons, I can ask the witness to be shown the document.  It was just also to make it easier for the Trial Chamber and the Defence to follow the proceedings.  So since there's a problem, we are going to proceed differently.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can the technicians tell us whether or not it is possible to have this document on the screen?  No?  They are indicating that this cannot be, so the document should be given to the witness and we shall try to follow.  We apologise for the difficulty. 
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, I think the Defence has in its possession a copy of this document.  I shall provide another copy for the Bench so that you can follow the proceedings.
May I proceed, Madam President?

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel for the Defence is not using his microphone.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please give a copy to the Defence, Madam Prosecutor.  Now that the Defence has a copy of the document, Madam Prosecutor, you may now proceed.
MS. ARBIA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MS. ARBIA:
Q.	Mr. Materassi, have you read this document? 
A.	I know this document.  It is the copy of a residence permit that was issued by our services. 
Q.	I believe this document is from your offices. 
A.	Yes, this is a copy of an original that is in my office. 
Q.	Witness, you said that it's a residence permit.  Could you, following the text of this document, explain to the Court the data that appear on the document? 
A.	As can be clearly seen, this is a document issued to Mr. Sumba Bura by the ministry of the interior, department of state police of Florence.  It is a residence permit for foreigners.  At the top you will see the code.  Following that, you can see his name, which is Sumba Bura, and the first name is Athanase, the date of birth, which is 1963.  He is listed as being a Zairean citizen.  Civil status, single.  Refugee.
Q.	(No interpretation)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(No interpretation)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We cannot hear the Prosecutor.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(No interpretation)
BY MS. ARBIA:  
Q.	Would you please repeat the date of birth that appears on the document?
A.	25th October 1963. 
Q.	(No interpretation)
A.	I'm sorry.  The nationality is Republic of Zaire.  Civil status, single.  Refugee.  Residence abroad, nothing is indicated there.  Address in Italy, he wrote "municipality of Florence."  Current address, Number 36 Via Paoletti.  After that we have the passport.  You can see that the passport is an ordinary one, the number of this ordinary passport, the expiry date of the passport in question.  After that its origin, that this passport was issued by the embassy in Italy, certainly the Zairean embassy in Italy or currently the Democratic Republic of Congo in Italy.  The date of issue of the passport is 11th of June.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The interpreter in the French booth indicates that he didn't hear the date clearly.
THE WITNESS:  
The date of arrival in Italy is 24th of April 1997 through Rome.  He had an ordinary visa issued by the Italian embassy in Nairobi, and the visa was to expire on the 31st of June 1997.  Reasons for the visit was religious reasons.  Reasons for stay:  Catholic religion.  Livelihood is indicated as being "other".  Here we do not have the name of his wife because this is a single person.  He has no children either.  The residence given in Italy, the archdiocese.  Place of residence we see, and then we can see the date on which the residence permit was issued, which is June 1998, as well as  the various expiry and renewal dates for his residence permit since then.  And then there is his signature and the signature of my superiors. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter cannot hear the French -- the Prosecutor. 
BY MS. ARBIA:  
Q.	According to the indications in this document, the permit was issued on the 2nd of May 1997.  Can you confirm that? 
A.	Quite so.  It can be read very clearly.  "First residence permit, 2nd of May 1997".
Q.	In respect of his first residence permit, in your Florence office, are there -- is there background documentation? 
A.	I have here the copies of the documents, of all the documents that we have in regard to Mr. Sumba Bura.  I am, in this case, referring to the documents that he submitted to request a residence permit.  We can show you, if required. 
Q.	Based on these documents that are in your Florence office, can you indicate to the Court when the first application was made by the person concerned? 
A.	Yes.  I can present the application here. 
Q.	Do, please. 
A.	Here are the copies of the various residence permits requested by the person concerned, as well as requests for renewal.  This is his first application, which I have in my hands.  This is an application originally signed by him.  You have basically the same information as I presented a while ago.  I do not know whether you wish to take a closer look at them.
Q.	Before displaying the document, can you describe to the Court the data or information that is contained in this application? 
A.	It is just about the same information contained in any residence permit, his names -- his name, date and place of birth, his citizenship, civil status, states whether he's a refugee or not, residence abroad, his address in Italy, in Florence, the type of document that he has -- this might be the passport -- the date of expiry of the passport, date when he entered Italy, the sort of visa that allowed him to enter Italy.  This is the data that appears on the document. 
Q.	Witness, could you please give us the details as to the surname and name that appear on this document? 
A.	Yes.  Surname is Sumba Bura, and the first name is Athanase. 
Q.	May I continue? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Could you also give the date and place of birth? 
A.	Yes.  I am going to read it to you.  The place that he indicated, Ciherano; and the date of birth is the 25th of October, 1963; citizen of Zaire; single; status, refugee; foreign address, Bukavu.  Shall I proceed? 
Q.	When was this application made?  Could you give us the date? 
A.	This application was made on the 2nd of May 1997. 
Q.	Were any documents attached to this application? 
A.	Obviously.  I have a copy of his passport, a copy of his visa, the copy of the letter from the archdiocese that he is attached to. 
Q.	You referred to a visa.  Could you describe this document?  Just describe it.
A.	Yes.  In Mr. Sumba Bura's passport, on page 17 thereof, you can see a visa stamp which was issued by the Italian embassy in Nairobi for a duration of the territory of Italy, which visa was issued to be valid from 1997 up to 31st of July of that year.  It was a single-entry visa.  It is a 90-day visa granted by the Italian embassy in Nairobi on the 17th of April 1997.  This visa is for passport Number 003654 (sic).  Type of visa, religious reasons.  Additional information, you have his name, Athanase Sumba Bura.  Other information was supposed to be multiple-entry, but he has only single-entry.  Then you have the stamp of the Italian embassy, the stamp of the immigration police of the airport of Rome.  That is Fiumicino Airport in Rome with the date of entry, followed by the signature of the head of the diplomatic mission in Nairobi.  Nothing else. 
MS. ARBIA:
Could the registry show the Court -- or show the witness Prosecution Exhibit P. 7? 

Madam President, Your Honours, do you have a copy before you?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We do not. 
MS. ARBIA:
I request that registry to kindly, kindly give a copy to the Judges. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The French interpreter requests a copy also. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you have any other copies available? 

MS. ARBIA:  
Yes.  I shall find out so that the interpreters and the Defence should have it.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
Defence, do you have the document?  This is the Prosecution Exhibit P. 7 we are referring to. 
MS. ARBIA:
Yes, I've already given a copy to the interpreters. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The Defence does not have a copy. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you wish to have a copy?
THE FRENCH INTERPRETER:
Can the Defence be requested to use -- to put on his microphone when he's addressing the floor? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, if you do not have any further copies, then we shall give ours.  Is it the passport?
MS. ARBIA:
It is the visa, Madam President -- it is the passport, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you not have a copy of the passport with you? 
THE FRENCH INTERPRETER:
Could Counsel Pognon be requested to use his microphone?
MR. POGNON:
Very well.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We shall lend you our copy. 
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, I did not think that I should make extra copies because we had disclosed this document to the Defence a long while ago, and I thought that they would have the copies with them. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have given a copy to the Defence, Madam Prosecutor, so you may proceed.
MS. ARBIA:  
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MS. ARBIA:
Q.	Witness, have you taken a look at this document? 
A.	Yes, I have looked at it.  It could have been a bit bigger.  I have a barely legible copy. 
Q.	Do you have a copy of better quality? 
A.	Quite so. 
Q.	Could you give it to the registry? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This copy will be photocopied.  It is a lot more visible than what the Court already has. 
MS. ARBIA:
May I proceed?  Thank you.
BY MS. ARBIA:
Q.	Is it the same document, that is, the one that you have and the one that was shown to you? 
A.	Yes, it is the same document. 
Q.	What is it? 
A.	Generally, when foreigners come to apply for a residence permit, they show their original passport.  They give it to us, or at least a copy of it, which we examine, and we realise that it is a copy of a passport -- yeah? -- which was given or issued to Mr. Sumba Bura, Athanase, from the Republic of Zaire.  It has all the information that should appear on a passport.
Q.	Could you give us some idea of the data included therein? 
A.	Yes.  Where the photograph appears, you can see Republic of Zaire.  You see the type of passport, country of origin, passport number, which is 0036543.  Then you see the name of Sumba Bura, the name Athanase.  Nationality, Zairean.  Date of birth, 25th October 1963.  The registration number of the passport, which is 000261/97.  The gender, which is masculine or male.  Place of birth, Ciherano.  And then you have the date of issue of the passport, which is the 10th of January 1997, and the expiry date is the 9th of January 2000.  At the top you see where the passport was issued, which is at Kinshasa on the 10th of January 1997.  Then you have a signature, below which you have another signature, which is that of bearer. 
Q.	Witness, I think you have already answered this question, but I would like you to reconfirm this.  Is this the passport that was attached to the application for a residence permit that you referred to earlier? 
A.	Yes, this is a copy of the passport that we have in our documents, in our files, concerning the request for a residence permit made by this person in Florence. 
Q.	Have you carried out an investigation as to the identity of the applicant? 
A.	I don't quite understand you.  You asked whether we had conducted investigations about what, madam?  
(Pages 1 to 9 by Priscilla Trillo)









	1000H 
BY MS. ARBIA:
Q.	Witness, I asked you whether, based on this passport and the database available for residence permits, whether you verify the identity of the applicant?
A.	Obviously.  When a foreigner comes to our office to ask for a residence permit, we ask for the original of his passport.  We check the information.  You see his photograph and verify whether it is, in fact, the same person.  If the information is accurate, we accept the application.
Q.	Was this passport verified when the holder entered Italy?
MR. POGNON:
Madam President --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(No interpretation) 
MR. POGNON:
I get the impression that I'm listening to a broken record.  The witness has answered again and again.  A document has been shown to him.  He has seen the photograph of the person.  I do not know what verification or what other verification the Prosecutor expects the Italian police to have done.  The witness has already answered the question, so please don't waste our time. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, this question has been put for the very first time.  You may proceed, Madam Prosecutor. 
MS. ARBIA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MS. ARBIA:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, you may answer the first question.  If you wish, I shall repeat it for you.
A.	I didn't quite understand.  For such verification, there may be a case where there is a visa that is the stamp of the frontier police.  If the frontier police has put a stamp, it means that the police has already conducted the verification of the person's photograph amongst others. 
Q.	Witness, I shall move on to other questions. 

Apart from the documents that have already been indicated to you, are there any other documents in your office pertaining to the immigration of Mr. Athanase Sumba Bura?
A.	The only document that we have is his passport.  That is the document concerning his residence.  We don't have any other document.  To the best of my knowledge, the document that we have is the passport that enabled him to enter the country. 
Q.	And apart from the document -- well, the question wasn't clear enough.  You are correct.  Are there other documents?  By other documents, I'm talking about a residence permit application for a residence permit apart from the one that we have already mentioned?
A.	Yes.  There are several residence permits that were (unintelligible) by him, and other passports are issued by the Zairean embassy.  Are you talking of renewal of residence permits?  You know when residence permits expire the foreigner comes and applies for a renewal, which was the case.  And in order to apply for a renewal, he brings the same documents that he brought before, that is, the passport and the visa and the other documents that I mentioned before.
Q.	To the best of your knowledge, which is the last residence permit that was issued to Sumba Bura, Athanase?
A.	I have here before me his last residence permit that was granted to him.  This document is dated 
11 December 2000, and it is valid up until the 25th of November, 2002.
Q.	Mr. Witness, is there a file in your Florence office, a file in the name of Seromba, Athanase?
A.	A file?  I don't think there is a residence permit issued to a person bearing that name, because in my office we only have documents pertaining to the residence permit, and the only residence permit whose copies we have are the residence permits of a Sumba Bura.  We don't have documents pertaining to any other person, madam.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'll go on to a different line of questioning. 

Are you aware of the applicable procedure in Italy in relation to a residence permit issued for humanitarian reasons?
A.	Yes, I'm aware of that.
Q.	Could you briefly explain to the Chamber what this procedure is all about?
A.	A citizen who has a problem in his country, for instance, a political problem in his country, generally when he comes to Italy, he goes to the police services and applies to be granted a status of a political refugee or to be granted exile, political excite.  That is how the procedure is, more or less.
Q.	And how does the procedure continue once there is an applicant where a person applies for asylum?
A.	Now, the police will ask the person concerned to give the background of his situation and to say why he needs that refugee status or why he is applying for asylum.  The police then takes his passport or withdraws his passport and gives him a residence permit for reasons of political asylum, which has a validity of a period of three months that can be extended, and after that, the authority -- the police gets -- can get all the documents of the person concerned in the centre for the recognition of a political status.  And this commission decides to grant the refugee status or not, or the asylum, as the case may be.
Q.	Mr. Witness, to the best of your knowledge, was such a procedure initiated in the name of Sumba Bura, Athanase, that's in Italy?
A.	In the -- amongst the documents that I have in my office, he never applied for that.  In any case, we have a copy of his passport, and as you can see in his statement that he made in my office and in his residence permit, what is put there is "refugee", because in his residence permit where it is written "Are you a refugee?" and it says he said no.  So we consider that he's not a refugee.
Q.	To the best of your knowledge, was such a procedure initiated in the name of Seromba, Athanase?
A.	No.  As I said a while ago, when a citizen applies for the refugee status, we withdraw his passport.  And in my office we don't have any passport bearing that name. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, I have come to the conclusion of my questions, and I'm requesting from the Chamber that since the witness has made reference to a clearer copy of the document that has already been admitted under the reference number P. 7, I would like to request from the Chamber, if it deems it advisable, to enter into the records the clearer copy so that it becomes the Exhibit P. 7 bis.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor.

Counsel Pognon, do you have any objection to the application that has been made by the Prosecutor?
MR. POGNON:
No objection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very good.  So this document which is more legible than the one at the disposal of the Tribunal is appended to the Exhibit P. 7 and referenced P. 7 bis.
(Exhibit No. P. 7 bis, admitted)
MS. ARBIA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good.  We thank you.

Counsel Pognon, are you the one to cross-examine the witness?  The floor is yours.
MR. POGNON:
Good morning, Madam President.  Good morning, Your Honours. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Mr. Witness, good morning.  My name is Alfred Pognon, and my learned colleague, Patrice Monthé, are the counsel for Father Athanase Seromba who -- whose name in your immigration papers in Italy is Sumba Bura, Athanase.

Mr. Witness, my first question is as follows:  Was any -- were any proceedings instituted against 
Mr. Athanase Sumba Bura in Italy?
MS. ARBIA:
I object to that question, Madam President, because it has no basis.  The witness has stated that he is an employee of the police office that -- the police immigration office and not the judicial police, so I think the proceedings will fall within the brief of the judicial police section.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I will address that objection immediately, even though I don't see it as an objection.  I think the purpose of this procedure is to establish that the Accused committed an offence, and that is why this witness was brought here, because we want to establish that he committed an offence.  It is clear, and this falls within the ambit of legal principles that you must know, if there was a complaint filed against the Accused in Italy, which is where, on the basis of his passport, he went, and the Accused is in a position to answer -- the witness is in position to answer the question if he is aware of this or not, so that objection is not valid.  And I did not interrupt the Prosecutor, and I do not think that I should be interrupted and that I shouldn't ask my question. 
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, the idea is not to interrupt my learned colleague.  The problem is, rather, legal and technical.
MR. POGNON:
Yes, it is juridical.
MS. ARBIA:
Counsel Pognon, I think I have the right --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Maître Pognon, can you wait for her to finish her question -- or her objection.
MS. ARBIA:
My objection has to do with the foundation, with the basis of the question.  The witness has given his attributions in the immigration office, and I'm repeating that the foundation of the question was not established, and the clarifications that he gave confirms my objection.  In other words, he talked about a complaint, and it is not the immigration office that receives any complaints.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, we are dealing with a police officer and one who is in charge of immigration.

May I continue?  Thank you, Madam President.

So we are -- we have here before us here a police officer who is empowered -- thank you, 
Madam President, for listening to me.  I need you to listen to me.  I was saying, therefore, that we have at the witness stand a police officer of the Italian police who is vested with the powers to issue documents that -- such as the ones he's just described.  And questions that have been asked and asked differently, he talked about what he did with respect to documents that apparently are normal and that were presented to him.  And he had to deal with a residence permit.  He had a passport that was renewed and that he renewed that residence permit on several occasions. 
It is all but normal that if these documents that he was holding did not reflect the reality, as people have tended to show, the authority that would have been aggrieved with respect to that should have filed a complaint.  It is normal therefore that in time and space, it is on the territory that such an offence would have been committed that proceedings would begin. 

So I'm asking if he was aware or if he was informed there was a complaint filed in Italy against Athanase Seromba for having applied for such documents.  He didn't answer the question.  And he's being accused of having fake documents here while the authority that has responsibility over the documents hasn't filed any complaint against him.  That is the basis of my question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the objection raised by the Prosecutor is founded, but if you can clarify the Tribunal, we will be prepared to listen to you on that issue that has been raised by Counsel Pognon. 
THE WITNESS:
I did not quite understand the question that was put to me.  I will therefore ask Counsel Pognon to repeat the question so that I can know exactly what he wants me to tell him. 
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Mr. Witness, thank you.  My question is very simple.  To the best of your knowledge, since it transpired that Athanase Sumba Bura and Athanase Seromba are one and the same person, has the Italian government, who had granted him the residence permit on the basis of documents that he filed, has the Italian government therefore instituted any proceedings or filed any complaint against him?
A.	My boss authorises me only to examine documents that have to do with residence permit.  I, therefore, could not know if any investigations have been carried out in Italy on the status or situation of Athanase Sumba Bura.  I talked to you about documents that were at my disposal.  That is the residence permits of Athanase Sumba Bura.
Q.	Thank you.  Can you tell us under what circumstances a residence permit -- a religious residence permit was issued in Italy in 1995?
A.	Do you want to know the reasons therefore? 
Q.	Yes. 
A.	Very well.  For a foreigner to regularise his status or situation in Italy, if such a foreigner is a cleric, he must be granted an authorisation or a permit from the Italian government.  And these non-Italian clerics, generally speaking, such permits are obtained from the embassy.  That is, the person concerned must have already been granted a visa at the embassy.  Now, when the person arrives in Italy, what we require -- and I'm sorry, that --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
He is going to start all over again.  He says he doesn't know how to explain things again. 
THE WITNESS:
So when the person arrives in Italy, as I was saying, we ask the cleric to join another religious congregation.  If it's a Catholic, the general rule is that the church or the bishopric or the archdiocese give him means of a livelihood and that it also ensures or provides him with health insurance.  This, of course, would be a person that comes to Italy with a regular visa.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	I asked you the question as to regarding an institution that goes back only up to 1995, at least that is what I learned, except I am mistaken, in which case you will make things clearer to us.  I am asking, therefore, the circumstances that led to the institution of a religious visa, a religious residence permit.  Well, you talked to us about the procedure.  I am now referring to the circumstances, and that was the meaning of my question.  If you are aware of them, tell us.  If you aren't, well...
A.	Do you want me to talk to you about the circumstances?  In fact, we have a legislation in Italy, laws of the Italian government, according to which when a foreigner comes to our country, this is the procedure that we have to follow.  Now, you are asking me to talk to you about the circumstances.  I cannot do so.  We have a series of laws.  We apply the law that is applicable in each specific case. 
Q.	I believe this goes back to 1995.  I mean, the religious permits.  Is that correct?  It was in 1995 that such a visa -- such permits were instituted; is that correct?
A.	I know that the residence permit -- I mean the religious permit that was instituted in 1995, since I work in that service, in the services I mentioned to you already.  But I think this has to do with the Martelli law.  It is a law of 1989 or 1990.  I do not quite remember.  It is the Italian law governing the residence of foreigners in Italy.  I cannot quite remember the date of entry into force of that law.
Q.	You, therefore, do not know whether before, but you confirm that it was in 1995 that that law that was adopted in 1989 entered into effect or that is when they started implementing that law?
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, the witness has already answered that question. 
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, the witness has not yet answered that question.  I will not like the Prosecutor to interrupt me. 
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, once again, this is not interruption.  I think I have the right to make -- to raise objections.
MR. POGNON:
Well, the objections should be founded. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, the witness answered by saying that it was the Martelli law of '89 or '90 that instituted that, but he was aware of that because he entered that service in 1995, at least that's what we understood.  And that is why we are telling you that the witness has answered.  Now, if you want to ask him another question for further clarification, that is okay, because his answer appears to be clear to be us.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I would like, very respectfully, to follow the following procedure in my reasoning.  A law was adopted at a given time, this law that was taken -- adopted at a given time was implemented or entered into force at another given time.  The circumstances of the adoption of that law, which made it such that the law was not implemented, but implemented subsequently, may explain certain things, and that is why I am following this logic.  That is, I'm going from the date of the adoption of the law right to the date of implementation of the law.  And I think it is a legal procedure or approach, but I consider that he stated that it was in 1995 that that law entered into force.  So I will stop here, unless the witness would like to tell me something else.
THE WITNESS:
Counsel, I would like you to understand this.  If you like, I can provide you with that law.  It is possible for us to find it on the Internet or in the library.  That is an Italian law relating to the residence of foreign nationals.  What you should understand is that, as you know, in Italy we have serious immigration problems, and that is why the law changes every two years.  But there are criteria applied for the reception of foreigners.  Those criteria are the same.  Some change, however.  As a matter of fact, in 1997, the requirements were same as those I have given you.  The criteria were the ones I have given you and nothing else.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	I thank you.  I thank you.  As a matter of fact, the question put to you has to do with the discussions.  I believe you are aware of those discussions that take place at a level of the government, which applied for the fact that in 1995 that law went into force, and it's applicable in the issue of visas.  I take it that you are not aware of that law, and that is all we can say.

When --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Wait a minute, Counsel.  Perhaps he wants to shed light on that subject.

Witness, do you want to make any clarifications with regard to the implementation of the provisions regarding visas issued on religious grounds? 

If I understood correctly, there are problems here at the Bench.  We haven't quite understood what you said, and I believe Counsel Pognon is dwelling on that matter for that reason.  I believe it was only in 1995 that that issue -- that visa started being issued. 
THE WITNESS:
No, Madam President.  It was not in 1995 that that visa was instituted.  I don't know how to put it.  I said that it was in 1995 that I started working in the immigration service of my country.  That was when I acquainted myself with that law, but that law has existed -- or had existed for quite some time. 
When laws are promulgated, I read it with my boss in our services.  The boss gives us the list of all documents that we have to request from any foreign national requesting a residence visa or permit.  For instance, if in my service a law comes into force, we apply it.  The documents I have in my possession here are copies of official documents that we have in our office in Florence.  These are all the documents which we requested in 1997.  Now, if you want to know which other documents exist and since when, I can request them from my service in Florence.  I did not bring all the documents in my office here.  I have here only documents concerning Mr. Sumba Bura.  I also have documents that were requested, and nothing more, so this is all I have here before me.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could counsel turn on his microphone, Madam President. 
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Witness, you said a while ago to the Prosecutor in answer to her question that the controls that you carry out when someone approaches your service and requests a permit concern travel documents, a passport, that they also concern a certain number of documents, and that when you receive those documents, you try to ascertain whether the photograph of the individual is in line with the photograph on the documents that the person presents.  Do you mean to say that these are the conventional controls that you carry out and that there aren't any others?
A.	As a matter of fact, there are other types of control.  As such, when a foreign national arrives and I don't know that foreign national, I request his or her passport.  I look at the person's photograph and I try to make sure it is the same person.  Then the person gives me other documents and photographs, and I also try to ascertain whether those photographs are those of the person in front of me. 

Subsequently, when the same foreign national comes back to collect his residence papers, I ask for his or her passport again.  I verify the photograph, the data on the documents, and I try to find out whether it is the same person, and then I hand the document over to the person, the person signs and goes.  These are, therefore, the routine controls that are carried out in the service.
Q.	I thank you.  The documents that are thus controlled or inspected with the photograph which enable you to grant the document demanded by the foreign national, is such inspection, until further notice, not based on examination of the physical appearance or the face of the foreigner?  The controls of the documents, are they not accompanied by the verification of the physical appearance or the face of the applicant?
A.	I have the passport in my hands.  I ascertain whether it is, indeed, that of the person in front of me.  Generally, it is the frontier police that verifies the validity of the passport.  They have equipment used to that effect.  As for me, I ascertain whether there is a visa issued by the embassy on that passport.  After the work of the frontier police, what I do is I look at the passport and I verify whether it is authentic, whether the photograph on the passport is that of the person in front of me.  I can carry out other controls, other verifications.  I can take fingerprints.  I don't know how it is said in Spanish.  These are the controls I can carry out when I have a passport in my hands. 
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, at this stage in my cross-examination, I wish to tender an exhibit.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Witness, you listened to the international press or you read international press and you were aware that the -- in 1994, specifically in April, there was a genocide in Rwanda.  Are you aware of that?
A.	All I know is what I read during that period, what the newspapers published at the time.  It had to do with people who are at war.  So the information I have is all I could glean at that time.
Q.	In relation -- you are in touch with international police, as well as humanitarian agencies, and you are aware that during those major disturbances, people flee their countries for reasons of security, don't you?
A.	Yes, I do know that many people come to our services, and these people are generally coming from countries at war or countries in which there are political problems. 
Q.	Are you aware that while they are fleeing under those circumstances, the people who are fleeing can, in a thousand and one ways, with a view to avoiding the dangers they face, rely on relations or contacts that can help them obtain travel documents in order to be in a position to travel?
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, I object to that question because it is too vague.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, the witness should be allowed to answer my question, unless I have to explain why this objection should not be upheld, because it is not an objection as such.

Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution -- for the Defence, respond to the objection.
MR. POGNON:
While I received several colleagues from Rwanda who were fleeing and who came wearing pyjamas, I received them as President of the Benin bar council humanly, because we have been going through a very catastrophic end of the 20th century, and is it is going on even today. 
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Humanly speaking, can somebody who is fleeing, in your opinion, rely on contacts and relations in order to guarantee his safety?
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, I don't think counsel for the Defence Pognon has responded to the objection before answering -- asking the next question.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I responded to the objection by saying we are in a century in which we are faced with catastrophes and people are fleeing in droves, and I am putting this question to the witness because humanly -- because justice is not only the sword, it is something which concerns us all. 

I put the question to the witness and he can respond to it, and the Prosecutor cannot object to that question.  That is the only way I can ask that question, unless I ask the Bench to put that question.  I don't think this question should be objected to.
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, the Prosecutor only wants to make sure that the parties are following the proceedings, so we are waiting for the decision from the Bench.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, the Chamber is of the opinion that the Prosecutor is entitled to make objections, just as you yourself can make objections. 

Regarding the question you have just put to the witness, we are of the opinion that you want the witness to give his opinion on something, whereas he is there to give evidence on specific matters.  So could you please rephrase your question.  Perhaps this will enable the witness to answer.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I tendered a document because I had to establish the circumstances under which the documents were issued.  I tendered a document, and I have to put this question to the witness, but if you want me to rephrase it, I will do so.  But the thrust of the question remains the same. 
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Witness --
MR. POGNON:
And, Madam President, this witness is someone who has been familiar or in touch with foreigners. 
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Witness, during the Accused's stay in Italy, did you learn in your office of people who came to pose a problem challenging the documents which he presented to you?
A.	I must say that I did not quite understand the question you have put to me.  Are you asking me whether someone came to ask for the documents that were filed by that person?
Q.	That is not the question I put to you.  I will rephrase it to make it clearer.

The documents that you have in the name of Sumba Bura, up till the time when he voluntarily left Italy when he decided to come here, did anyone come to your office or did you receive any information that challenged those documents or said that those documents were not authentic?
A.	Very well, I have understood.  I will take over again what I've already said.  What I have in my possession is the documents I have mentioned to you.  I believe, and I repeat again that it is only an opinion, that in our office and other offices in Florence there is someone in charge of such questions. 
Now, you are asking me whether someone came.  All I can say is that I have documents relating to the regularisation of the situation of that person.  I know that investigations are under way relating to the identity of individuals and in connection with documents presented, and that is all I can tell you.  If you wish, you can verify. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
	The witness stops talking.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Do you know where he works?  This is mentioned on the documents you have.  Do you know where the Accused is working, where he is living, and where he can be contacted?
A.	In the documents in our possession, all we have is the place of residence of the Accused in Florence.  And outside of Florence, his place of work, I have here with me letters from the archdiocese or the priory of Florence.  He used to say mass in some churches.  I also have a document relating to a change of domicile.
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  Are you aware that the Accused, who is a priest, obtained his passport while he was fleeing on the recommendation of his superiors from the bishops of Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo?  Are you aware of that?
A.	No, I was not aware of that.  I know that he is a priest, because that is what is stated on the documents in my possession.  I know nothing about what you have just referred to.
MR. POGNON:
In that case, I would like the witness to be shown the document in question, since he has documents from the archdiocese of Florence.  So the witness should be shown the document in question so that he should acquaint himself with it.
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, I have not quite understood whether it is a question relating to the question the witness has answered to.  If it isn't, then I object to that -- the tendering of that document.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Pognon, are you referring to the letter from the Rwandan episcopal conference?
MR. POGNON:
I am referring to that letter, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Indeed, the witness has just said that he is not aware that there was a recommendation from the bishops in respect of Father Seromba. 
MR. POGNON:
I would simply want to acquaint himself with it. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But he cannot acquaint himself with it; it is in French.

MR. POGNON:
In that case, the interpreters can read it out to him, because I want to tender this as an exhibit, and that was why I am putting questions to the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution, do you want to add something?
MS. ARBIA:
Yes, Madam President.  So this is a document on which the witness has already given his answer concerning the limits of his knowledge, so I find this manner of cross-examination inadmissible, Madam President.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, we are here -- may I respond, Madam President?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may respond, Counsel.
MR. POGNON:
We are here to shed light on the circumstances under which the Accused obtained a Zairean passport, as a matter of fact, from the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is something that the Prosecutor is charging the Accused of.  And we have said that this is a factual element, and it should be explained to the Chamber the circumstances under which he obtained that document.  It is totally normal that since the Prosecutor has posed this problem, light should be shed on this fact.  There shouldn't be -- the proceedings should be -- shouldn't be stalled on this matter.  The Chamber should know, since this fact should be clarified, and it has not been clarified elsewhere, as far as the documents were obtained show.  So I want the Chamber to be enlightened in all respects, and that is why the witness is here.
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, Your Honours, for more detail, the Accused -- I do not wish to give the argument on this point in front of this witness.  Up until a few minutes ago, the Accused had never admitted the facts that were contained in the correspondence between the Prosecution and the Accused.  He has admitted to other facts.  I may submit a brief on that later, but I don't think I should say them in front of this witness.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, this is not correct.  It is not at all correct.  In any case, the problem is there.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, please, Counsel.  Try to use the appropriate language for this courtroom. 
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, perhaps my vocabulary is not good enough.  If a thing is not correct, then I cannot say anything other than the fact that it is not correct.  I don't know whether I should return to school, but facts are facts. 
In a letter we acknowledge the fact that there had been a change of names.  The problem has come up again.  The problem is present, in any case.  Since it is present at this time, does the Trial Chamber have the right -- does the Trial Chamber have the right to be apprised of the circumstances under which Athanase Seromba fleeing his country obtained a Zairean passport or not?  I am before a Court that has used witnesses called X who were granted names so that they could go elsewhere. 

Madam President, does the Court wish to know?  Should we inform the Court so that it will be in the know?  That is the problem.  If that is the problem, then allow us to provide information through the questions.  This is the witness we have before us.  If we had a witness from the judicial police, we would have another problem, but we do not have a witness from the judicial police because this matter has never been brought before the judicial police in any way.  So please allow us to discuss the circumstances, unless, of course, the Court does not wish this to be done.  That is the issue. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we cannot accept this document.  The witness stated clearly that he is not at all aware of what happened in respect of the issuing of this passport itself.  So we would like to know, indeed, what happened, but I do not think that the Accused is in any way charged with the use of false documents or forgeries, so let us move on.  This is just a letter that you have produced here for us, which is a letter from the episcopal conference of Rwanda, which in any case, or generally speaking, he's requesting assistance for priests in difficulty.  That has been duly included in the records; however, I do not think that we need further information in that respect.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, you will see in this letter something that is underlined in the third paragraph where it is said, "We are sure that you will spare no effort to assist anyone who wishes to pursue his priestly ministry from -- far from the danger of being taken to Rwanda by force."  That is what is in this document.  However, I am in complete agreement with you, I have said this before, which is why we are not unduly disturbed by this discussion.  But we have to explain and we have to provide clear answers where this is required.  We are performing our duty in this regard.  We shall set aside this document, as you have stated, but we may return to it subsequently when the circumstances permit.  But our problem here is to give the explanations that are required.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Quite so, Counsel.  We shall then move to something else, if you have other questions for the witness.
MR. POGNON:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Witness, are you aware that the Accused who is here, when he learned that he was being prosecuted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, requested of his only volition to leave Italy, to leave Florence to come to this Court to be tried?  Are you aware of that?
A.	Yes, I read that in the papers.
Q.	Did you know it?
A.	Yes, I knew it.
Q.	Thank you. 
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I shall have to tender a few documents in respect of this information.  These documents will attest to the fact that the Accused, of his own volition, on his own initiative, wrote to this Tribunal, wrote to the Prosecutor of his readiness to stand trial.  I shall tender a first document dated 14th of September.  The Prosecutor is in possession of this document. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, do you have many more questions for this witness?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone please, Counsel.
MR. POGNON:
All I need do is tender a few documents concerning the voluntary surrender of the Accused.  I have always said that the Accused is not being prosecuted for this particular matter. 
MS. ARBIA:
In any case, Madam President, Your Honours, I think it's a waste of time.  The Prosecutor has admitted these facts.  There is no question as to the voluntary surrender of the Accused.  However, I should like to contest the Defence procedure.  The witness has stated that he was aware through the newspapers that the Accused voluntarily gave himself up to the Arusha Tribunal.  So I find it hard to understand that Defence wishes to tender these documents through this witness.  I do not think that this is the correct procedure.  If the Defence wishes to tender these documents, it is its choice, and when the exculpatory evidence is being presented, the Defence may present these documents as it wishes, but I do not think that they should be presented through this witness.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, it is said at one point that the witness does not know these documents so they cannot be tendered through him, and then it was said afterwards that he has knowledge of this information via the newspapers.  So I do not know what the correct argument here is.  I'm lost. 
(Pages 10 to 23 by Sherri Knox)







1115H
MR. POGNON (continuing):
Madam President, I have a document here that comes directly from the Questura of Florence, and I also seek to tender this document.  This document is a transcript dated 23rd November 2001 which comes from the Questura of Florence.  

Madam President, may I proceed?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you have already given us a document.  There has been an objection thereto.  The Prosecutor considers that it is not denied that the priest gave himself up to this Tribunal.  We, for our part, consider, and this is what we manifested in denying the tendering of certain documents by the Prosecutor, because we consider that the Prosecutor could not tender these documents with Investigator Sahiri.  This is therefore the same position that the Trial Chamber is adopting in respect of the documents you seek to tender, considering that this witness has no connection with this document.  All he has said is that he learnt through the press that the priest gave himself up willingly.  You may seek to tender these documents by other means, but we cannot accept them if you seek to tender them via this witness.
MR. POGNON:
Most obliged, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Pognon.  Do you have any other questions?
MR. POGNON:
Yes, yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Shall we take our break now, or is it your last question?
MR. POGNON:
No, I think that it will be well to take the break.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, we shall take the break for 15 minutes.
MR. POGNON:
May I have my documents back, please?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, the documents will be returned to you, Counsel.  

Registry, will you be so kind as to take these documents back to Counsel Pognon.
MR. POGNON:
I think you need to get a document from the Prosecutor.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is adjourned for 15 minutes.
(Court recessed from 1118H to 1133H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is now in session.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Witness, can you tell us once again where you work?
A.	I work in the immigration office of the préfecture of Florence.  In particular, right now I'm working at the desk where foreigners come to apply for residence permits when they come to Florence, period.
Q.	Thank you.  You're answerable to Dr. Gian Carlo Benedetti.  Are your services under those of 
Dr. Gian Carlo Benedetti?
A.	No, my current line superior is Dr. Parlo Ponponero (phonetic).  The gentleman you are referring to, it would appear, works in a different office still within the province of the préfecture of Florence.  Can you read the document bearing his signature once again?  You will see that that document, I think, bears his signature, unless I'm mistaken.
Q.	I read, "Before us, Carlo Gian Benedetti and Inspector S.U.P.S. Becherucci."  Are these persons 
non-commissioned officers?  I think I will read this, which is in Italian.  "Carlo Gian Benedetti, the senior inspector, Senior Inspector S.U.P.S. Becherucci, Alexandro."   Becherucci, Alexandro, are those police officials who were officers in the Italian police force?  Do you all work in the same department?
A.	No, not the gentleman whose name you have just read.  The person whose name you have just read does not work in my department.  I know Chief Becherucci.  I know that we have had to work in the same palace, so I saw him from time to time, but he's not my line superior.  I have nothing to do with him, but if you will allow me, can you read the first page of that document because you will see the office in which he works if you did that.
MS. ARBIA:
Counsel Pognon, I think I will raise an objection concerning the manner in which the Defence is proceeding.  I don't think it -- dialogue between the Defence and the witness.  I do not know what kind of document counsel is reading, and the witness is saying, "You read it first of all."  You first of all have -- if the counsel for the Defence wants to present a document to the witness and ask him questions, that will be okay, but if the information is contained in the document that is already admitted in evidence, I think this will clarify the debate.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I will have to give the basis of my document.  I would like the witness to tell me if he knows the person, and I'm trying to put the question to him as to whether he knows the person, and he is answering the question, and the Prosecutor has just stood up again to say that this is not normal.  I am putting the question to him and he will tell me if he knows him or not.  If he doesn't know him, then he'll tell me.  If he knows him to be of a different department, he will tell us.  I will continue, and I'm sorry, but I don't have any lessens to receive from you, Madam Prosecutor.  Please let me proceed.  I'm in the process of asking a question, and after the question has been asked, then you can raise your objection if you want.
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, I'm not here to give lessens to anybody.  I'm only trying to follow the procedure.  I have followed it, and concerning the fact whether it's a question that doesn't have anything to do with the document, I don't have any objection, but that is not the document.  I think all the parties should be aware of the type of documents that are in question for us to continue with the proceedings, but if the question has nothing to do with the document, then I don't have any problem with that, but if it has to do with a document I'm not aware of, then I will have to raise an objection.
MR. POGNON:
Well, I have a document from the police here, and I want to be certain that I am -- I have before me a police officer who works in that department.  Before I can continue, I know that that is why I gave one name, I gave a second name, and he's trying to give an answer.  If he tells me, "Yes, I know him," if he clarifies my question, I will continue with my examination.  If he doesn't know the person, I will not continue.  I don't really know what is happening here.  I don't understand at all.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Pognon, you have asked questions to the witness, first by asking if he knew those two persons, Carlo Gian Benedetti and Alexandro Becherucci.  I think the witness has told us that he doesn't work with those persons.  He thinks he knows the first person that was named.  If you want to proceed and to ask him questions on the documents that you have, you should avail us of those documents because we are totally in the dark insofar as those documents are concerned.

Now, if the idea were just to ascertain whether that witness can give you some clarifications, I think that has been done already, so it is up to you to take a decision.  If you want to proceed with questions on the document, you should give us copies thereof, but if you think that you want to stop there, there is no problem with that.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I am trying to follow the rules that have been followed before this Chamber and that I have had to follow in other courts.  I have a document, and even before knowing whether I'm going to continue with the witness, I want to be sure that the document that I have before me, which is a police document, that he knows about it, because I've just asked him a question and he said he read from papers, and right now I have a police document with me, and that's why I'm asking a question, and he was answering the question when the Prosecutor stood up.  I don't understand, so I am going to proceed.  He was answering the questions, and I must draw the Tribunal's attention to the fact that he was already answering the questions.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, it doesn't matter whether the witness is answering the questions or not.  Right now we have an objection and we have told you how to proceed, and you proceed.  That is all, I don't think we need to backtrack.  Now, if you want to make use of that document, we will request that you give us copies of the document.
MR. POGNON:
I am going to avail you of the document and I will proceed with me examination.  My answer -- well, there is the French behind.  If I have to proceed with the questions that I want to put to him, it would depend on the answers that the witness will give, so I should be able to put questions to him in order to know if he knows that department and the relationship between the department that I'm talking about and his department.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, is there a nexus between the services of the general state police department and the department in which you work?
A.	I told you, it's a type of police that carries out investigations in general.  That office needs documents that the office has, and we have to give documents to the general police department -- state department in general, and we gave them to the mobile squad department.  It all depends on the type of investigations concerned.
Q.	Now, given that kind of relationship or connection, do you have to cooperate by giving to the head office of the police state information that you have at your disposal?  Can we say that that type of relationship underpins the cooperation existing between the two offices?
A.	If by that you understand -- well, I also work under the authority of the state.  We come to the assistance of each other.  We have the duty to show them documents within the framework of police cooperation.  It is also within the framework of that duty that I'm here to avail you of documents that you have here.
Q.	Within that framework, therefore, are you informed in ways other than through newspapers that the Accused was heard or interviewed by Gian Carlo Benedetti and Inspector Becherucci, who are 
non-commissioned officers of the Italian state police?  Are you informed -- are you aware that on the 
23rd of November 2001, the Accused was interviewed or was heard under oath by those Italian police chiefs?
A.	Now I am learning.  Now I know -- I know it now.  I recognise Mr. Becherucci's report.
Q.	Is it only now that you are getting to know about it?
A.	I am learning now that there is a report by Mr. Benedetti, and I'm only learning of this now.
Q.	Do you mean to say that you are not aware of the contents of that statement or transcript, that you don't know -- you were not aware of the purport of that report before coming here?
A.	I was not aware of the contents of that report before coming here.

MR. POGNON:
Under the circumstances, Madam President, regarding -- in so far as it concerns something, insofar as the relationship between the work of those various police services, if the Tribunal will so wish it, I will read out the contents of the document.  If the Trial Chamber will not want me to read it out, I can do this subsequently.
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, I believe that time is not extensive.  I don't think the Defence has explained the relevance of that document and has not given the grounds, therefore, under Rule 90.  I don't know if it has to do with the credibility of the witness.  These are not circumstances that were dealt with under the examination-in-chief, so at this stage I am not seeing any grounds for such types of questions.  Thank you, Madam President.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can counsel be requested to put on his microphone.  Thank you. 
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I have just put questions that may premise my use of these documents to the witness.  The witness has stated first that he learned that the Accused had surrendered himself freely, of his own volition.  When he left Italy, I have come up with the report of the state police with which he collaborates, given that this is a person who works in Italy, and whose services collaborate with the other purpose, and thanks to the collaboration that he has with the other services, which he did recognise, if those -- if the material are enough, and I think they are enough, since he states that he is aware of this report and that it's only here that he learns of that report, you will determine whether this document should be made use of or not, and if you do not so decide, we will put it aside to be used at a subsequent occasion.

Regarding Rule 90, I do not quite see what the Prosecutor is referring to.  I have perused this, but I don't quite see the grounds for which the Prosecutor is invoking it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Pognon, the Chamber will not admit those documents for now.  You can always, as you have said, seek to tender them during the evidence of another witness.  That witness says he doesn't know that document and that he just learnt of it here in this courtroom.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Counsel.
MR. POGNON:
Under the circumstances, Madam President, I will withdraw the documents, and I have concluded my cross-examination of this witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Pognon.  And may the documents be returned to Counsel Pognon. 
Madam Prosecutor, do you wish to re-examine the witness? 
MS. ARBIA:
No, Madam President, the Prosecutor doesn't have re-examination to conduct.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very good.  

Witness, we thank you for having come to give evidence before this Trial Chamber and for having answered the questions put to you by the Prosecutor and by the Defence counsel.  We would like to wish you a safe trip back to your country.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, do you have another witness? 
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, Your Honours, given the time that we have at our disposal, I believe that it is not advisable to introduce a new factual witness, given the time that will be required for the 
examination-in-chief and cross-examination, but the Prosecutor would like to introduce another witness that is not a factual witness.  I'm referring to Witness Furrigia, but insofar as this witness is concerned, I must submit that this witness has just arrived in Arusha.  It therefore will be necessary for us to take some time before calling him.  

My application, therefore, will be that we call him to appear tomorrow morning, and if the Chamber deems it necessary, we could hold the status conference today, some time in the afternoon.  In any case, I will put myself in the hands of the Chamber for the decision, but my application is that we postpone for a short while the examination of -- or the testimony of Witness Furrigia, since he just arrived in Arusha, and the idea is to give him some time so that he can recover from the trip so that he can be available for his hearing, and as far as this is concerned, I think I'm in the hands of the Chamber.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Monthé. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, Madam President, thank you.  I understand the need for the witness to have some rest, but my concern is elsewhere.  Madam President, could the Prosecutor be so kind as to tell the Defence what the witness will be examined on, because right now we are not aware of this.  This will enable us to avoid having the polemics as to the nature of the cross-examination that will be led as we had some time ago.  I think the Chamber can put this question to the Prosecutor so that we can have serene discussions, as we have been trying to do for about an hour here before you.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Monthé.  

Madam Prosecutor, can you please enlighten us as to the evidence of Witness Furrigia, and can you tell us how long this will take?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And in which language you are going to speak, Madam President, so that the interpreters can organise themselves.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thought we understood that Mr. Farrugia spoke English.
MS. ARBIA:
That is correct, Madam President.  He will be speaking in English.  

Regarding the subject of his evidence, I think we have already filed a pre-trial brief with a summary of each witness and the subject of their evidence, and as concerns Farrugia, his evidence features in the summary, and we already know that there was no prior statement that was made by that witness, so we did not have any material to disclose in that respect.  We also somehow summarised the points on which the witness will be giving evidence, and if the Defence wants me to read out that summary, I can do that, but it's a summary that is available to the Defence and for the Chamber, and I will maintain what is summarised in this document.  This is a document that was filed on 7th September 2004.

As for the duration, Madam President, Your Honours, the examination-in-chief will be very short.  It may take half an hour and no more.  Thank you. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Monthé. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
I wish sincerely to avoid difficulties like the one we had before.  The Prosecutor has just told us about the document, and I have before me that document.  This is what is mentioned therein: "No statement yet.  In 2001, a journalist talked to Seromba about allegations that are in the indictment, and Seromba claimed that he was outside Rwanda at that time."  

That is what we have concerning the statement by Mr. Farrugia, and I will not like that when questions will be put to him tomorrow we are told that we are talking outside the evidence.  If Mr. Farrugia comes tomorrow to give his opinion on Father Seromba and the problems of Rwanda, this should be made clear so that the Defence is well appraised and so that the Tribunal should take note of this, because we will not accept the usual talking or debates that goes on and on.  

Thank you, Madam President.

Madam President, apparently Mr. Farrugia doesn't seem to have talked to Mr. Seromba, so there are problems that are looming in the horizon, so I'm saying this well beforehand so that there is no confusion.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, could you make any further qualifications regarding the evidence of that witness, as the Defence has requested.  

By the way, we would like to know whether this witness, who has just arrived this morning or last night -- we want to know why he cannot appear at 3 p.m., which would enable us to finish with the witnesses today and have a status conference tomorrow, or the meeting tomorrow, which would be more convenient for us.
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, Your Honours, the Prosecutor will do all in its capacity and ability so that Farrugia be heard in the afternoon at 3 p.m.  We will do our best.  

As regards the witness who is giving evidence, this is a journalist who, at that time, was interested in the events in Rwanda in 1994, and specifically to the events that the Accused is charged in connection with, so his evidence will be on what was directly in connection with the charges of the Accused, and I believe that the hearing of this witness will revolve around that.  In brief, I don't have details, because that witness didn't give a statement, but to shed more light on his evidence, I want to point out that he's a journalist, and in that capacity he met the Accused.  And that will be the subject of the hearing of that witness.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I am afraid that we will have a serious conflict.  If the Prosecutor wants to call an expert witness, they should respect the procedure for expert witnesses.  The Prosecutor has just said that that person was a journalist and he was interested in the problems in Rwanda.  That is all we know.  

As regards any meeting he may have had with the Accused, I deny that formally, so I am wondering whether that person should be called, who is apparently very tired.  I think we should allow him to go and visit animals in the park.
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, I find what the counsel has said not really appropriate.  This is not an expert opinion (sic) who has come to give his opinion on events in Rwanda.  I have specified the purpose of his evidence.  We are talking of a colloquium in which the Accused participated, so the Prosecutor will not ask questions regarding events in Rwanda and Nyange, since in 1994 that journalist was in Italy, and he only learnt of those events subsequently.  

I believe I have sufficiently enlightened the Chamber on the purpose of his evidence.  The arguments raised by the Defence are somewhat ironical and I do not accept that.  

I would like to make a general observation.  Whenever the Prosecutor objects, there are always criticisms that are not in place.  I would like to recommend that we should avoid such criticisms in order not to waste time and we should abide by the rules in order to make progress.  The hearing of Farrugia will not take a lot of time.  The subject matter is well circumscribed, and I would request that he should be allowed to give evidence, and I repeat again that I undertake to limit the questions I will put to the witness on one or two points in the subject matter I have just specified.  So, 
Madam President, this is my request to the Chamber.  In the next stage in the proceedings, we should understand that there is no fight between the Prosecutor and the Defence.  We are merely following the procedure, and we are there to follow the directives of the Chamber on how we should move ahead, and all criticisms should be outside of such proceedings.  I thank you.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I believe the golden rule is that the Defence should have the last word, so I want to avail myself of this right.  

Madam Prosecutor, you are right.  A trial is an adversarial fight and raising of arguments.  As far as we are concerned, the problem is not the duration of the evidence of this witness.  The problem has to do with the merits of his appearance here.  It's what he's going to say in line with Father Seromba's case.  Has he met Father Seromba?  And the answer is no.  That is Father Seromba's answer.  Was he in Nyange in 1994?  No.  And since he was in Italy at the time, what is he going to do?  So these arguments are legal arguments that are well founded.  That is why, Madam President, we maintain that the presence of this witness is not justified.  We have not had the opportunity to tell us what he's going to testify to up to now.  These are the facts of the case, and I'm sorry to say so, but these are the facts of the case.
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, we are wasting time for nothing.  I have already stated the summary of evidence, and service was September 2004.  I have already circumscribed the subject of the evidence that will be given by the witness.  It is sufficiently clear.  
The Defence always has the opportunity to cross-examine the witness, and they can submit that the statements of the witness are false, so I do not know why this argument is continuing.  It is true that there is adversarial discussion between the parties, but it should be engaged in in accordance with the rules.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber maintains that it wants to hear the witness at 3 p.m. and we will be enlightened in that regard.  So we will adjourn now and resume at 3 p.m. with examination of Witness Farrugia, Allessandro.  We thank you all.  

The proceedings stand adjourned.  Good afternoon.  
(Court recessed at 1211H)
(Pages 24 to 33 by Trevor Gerbes)


























(Proceedings resumed at 1505H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is now in session.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  Counsel for the Prosecution, is your witness here?
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, good afternoon.  Our witness is here, and he can be ushered in.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Yes, Counsel Monthé.  Do you have a problem?  Isn't it working?  Could you help Counsel Monthé, please. 

Good afternoon, witness.  Are you Alessandro Farruggia.
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Could you please tell us who you are.
THE WITNESS:
I'm a journalist, an Italian journalist, working for the Roman office of Quotidiano Nazionale, which published three daily newspapers in Milan, Florence, and Bologna.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Witness.  We would like you to now make a solemn declaration, please.
(Declaration made by Alessandro Farruggia in English)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you.  Witness, you will now be examined in-chief by counsel for the Prosecution, and then the Defence will also put questions to you, and if need be, the Bench may also put questions to you.  

Counsel for the Prosecution, please proceed to examination-in-chief of the witness.
MS. ARBIA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
ALESSANDRO FARRUGGIA,
first having been duly sworn, 
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF

BY MS. ARBIA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  Mr. Farruggia, a while ago, in answer to the President's question, you stated what your occupations -- or your occupation correctly.  Now, I would like you to tell the Chamber what your occupation was in 1999.
A.	I was working as a journalist in the same position in the Roman office of the Quotidiano Nazionale, which published daily newspaper La Nazione, Resto Del Carlino and Giornale.
Q.	As a journalist, were you interested in the events that had occurred in Rwanda in 1994?
A.	Yes.  I wrote about that.
Q.	What particular -- what specific subjects, please?
A.	I wrote about the case of Father Seromba.
Q.	Did you write articles on the case of Father Seromba?
A.	Yes.  I wrote three articles on that case in 1999.
Q.	On what basis did you write those articles?
A.	I wrote those articles because I was informed by another journalist, a British journalist, that there was new material coming from an NGO called African Rights concerning a priest that was working as a parisher (sic) in Florence, and one of my newspapers is based in Florence, so that's why I was very much interested in that case.
Q.	What activities of a journalist did you carry out in relation to this case?
A.	I work with my colleagues of La Nazione and the British colleague that I mentioned before, which is from the Sunday Times.  John Follane was the foreign correspondent from Rome.  I tried, first of all, to have this report from African Rights, and I did it and I contacted them -- our former correspondent in London for understand better the reliability of this NGO, and then I contacted some people in the church in Florence, in the curia of Florence, to know if it was true or not that there was a priest in that special church that was coming from Rwanda.  And then I moved from Rome to Florence, to my newspaper, and together with another colleague, we went to that church.
Q.	Can you tell the Chamber the name of the colleague who was with you?
A.	Yes, Alessandro Antico.
Q.	What other activities did you carry out subsequently as a journalist?
A.	About this case? 
Q.	Yes, we are still referring to the same case.
A.	I've continued to follow up that case.  As I told, I went to the church and because I wanted to speak with Mr. Seromba, which I was not sure if it was Mr. Seromba until that.
Q.	Have you ever met Father Seromba -- Mr. Seromba?
A.	Yes, I went to the church to speak with him in November 1999.
Q.	Did you have a conversation with him?
A.	Yes, I had a short conversation with him.  Do you want that I speak in the matter, to know what I say to him?
Q.	Yes.  If you wish, you could relate the contents of your statement, your interview.
A.	No problem.  I just approached him and I say to him, "Good afternoon" -- I think it was afternoon.  "Good afternoon, Mr. Seromba," and he look at me very surprised and said, "I'm not Mr. Seromba.  My name is Sumba Bura."  And we had a short conversation.  I told him that it was this report from African Watch that accused him of crimes committed in 1994, and he said that he does not know anything, that he's not responsible of anything, and that he was not there at that time, so he could not be responsible of anything.  That's what he said.  And I also asked him if he is able to make an interview about this, and because there was a colleague of me that wanted to make an interview with a photographer, and he said, "No problem, later on," and in fact it's what he did.
Q.	Who was that colleague, please?
A.	The colleague was Alessandro Antico.
Q.	As far as you remember, did the journalist, Alessandro Antico, proceed to take a photograph of Father Seromba?
A.	Yes, yes.  There was a photographer from my newspaper and they took pictures.
Q.	Are you aware of the contents of that interview?
A.	Yes.  After the interview, Alessandro Antico came to the newsroom and make me listen the tape where he recorded the interview, and basically were the same things that Father Seromba told me basically.
MS. ARBIA:
At this stage in the proceedings, Madam President, I would request the registrar to show the witness a document that was mentioned on the Prosecution list of documents, and it is the article published by the journalist Alessandro Antico.  This article was related -- it is the interview of Father Seromba that was published.  It is exhibit or document K0246430.  That's in the Italian documents, and it is the page number of the article in its original language.  The French version has the following number: K0246432, and its English translation has the following number:  K0246433.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, please.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Could you kindly ask the Prosecutor to give me a copy of that document because I don't have it.  I thank you.
MS. ARBIA:
Very willingly, my learned friend.  I would be obliged, Counsel.  I imagine you would be interested in all the versions.
MR. MONTHÉ:
The most exhaustive would be the -- most comprehensive would be the best for me. 
MS. ARBIA:
I would also request the registrar start to give copies to the Judges.  Perhaps I should repeat the 
K-numbers of the various versions.   

MADAM PRESIDENT:
It would make things easier for us, in as much as you made mention of such and such a document, because we have noted the various numbers.
MS. ARBIA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MS. ARBIA:
Q.	Witness, do you have this document before you?
A.	No.
Q.	Do you have it now, Witness?  Witness, as an Italian journalist, you are also in a position to read the original version of this article.  It is document number K0246430; that's the first page.  The second page is K0246431.  Could you please confirm that?
A.	Yes, I confirm it.
Q.	You have the English and French versions of this document, and the English version is of interest to you since you are speaking in English, and that is document K0246433. 
A.	Correct.
Q.	As regards the French version, I will repeat the K-number.  It is document number K0246432.  Witness, do you recognise this article?
A.	Yes, it was the article from Alessandro Antico, which was published in our newspapers. 
Q.	Is this the article that was published on the basis of the interview you made mention of a while ago?
A.	Yes, the interview made by Alessandro Antico.
Q.	Witness, before this article was published, did you acquaint yourself with the contents of that interview?
A.	Yes, I spoke with Alessandro Antico, and he made me listen the tape with the -- which was containing the registration of the interview.  Also because I wanted to speak about the interview to my colleague from the Sunday Times, which was also interested, so I had to listen about the tape.
Q.	Mr. Witness, are you able to recall -- now, in order that the Chamber should understand properly, are you able to recall the contents of that recording?
A.	Basically it's what you see here in the article.  Father Seromba refused the accuses (sic).
Q.	Wait a minute.  I will come to that more specific question later.  What I want you to say is whether you are in a position to recall the contents of that recording.
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, on the basis of the English text, which will facilitate understanding, that is, K0246432, I think about the 12th line.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Pognon. 
MR. POGNON:
As regards this witness, and specifically his presence here, he has stated that he had a brief conversation with Father Seromba.  I believe, as is the practice in journalism, the cassette recording of that interview should be produced so that he can be admitted as a witness before the Tribunal, even if it concerns only that brief conversation.  Secondly, it is the interview of a colleague of his, who is a journalist, which is produced here.  It is not his interview.  Before this Chamber, we are accustomed to obtaining cassettes of interviews because those cassettes contain both the voice and the subject of the interview, what the person interviewed said.  I know in the Media case, many cassettes were produced.  Particularly, when an article is not by the witness in question, the cassette would justify his presence here, and the cassette will determine whether he's an expert witness or a factual witness.  Those are the only two capacities in which a witness can appear here.  I don't know what we are doing here now.  Hearing a journalist and having him relate the contents of an interview conducted by another; whereas, we don't have a cassette justifying the audio-visual interview.  In any case, an audio recording.  So I object to the hearing of this witness in relation to the African Rights issue and in relation to the interview of Alessandro. 
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, Your Honours, we have already discussed the admissibility of this witness, and in language (unintelligible) the witness is here giving evidence.  He has already spoken in relation to his direct interview with Father Seromba, at least part of his interview.  He is now relating facts which he has personal knowledge of.  He is relating what he heard, the recording of an interview conducted by his colleague, which he heard with his own ears.  So there is absolutely no reason not to admit this evidence. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Pognon. 
MR. POGNON:
I must respectfully insist before this Court, in respect of the media, we have always had to use tapes, especially concerning interviews.  The translation -- transcription of these tapes or interviews are not a reflection of the interview itself.  So I would like to insist here and state that this witness -- that this witness should provide the tape of the brief interview that he claims to have had with Father Seromba, and, secondly, if he's unable to produce such tape, he cannot appear before this Court.  And even if he were to produce the tape, he can only give testimony about the contents thereof.  Concerning the interview of Alessandro Antico, it is absolutely necessary for us to have the tapes.  I think this is how we have always proceeded before this Court.  I object, and I say that the explanations that have been provided have no legal basis. 
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, I do not know to what jurisprudence my eminent colleague -- my distinguished colleague is referring to concerning the Media trial.  We are here under very simple conditions.  The witness has already given testimony about facts that he knows directly following his interview with Father Seromba at the time.  The witness is recounting facts that -- what he heard with his own ears in the tape.  It is up to the Trial Chamber to weigh the evidence, and based on Rule 89, the Trial Chamber can admit these elements which show the witness's direct knowledge.  If the Defence requires clarification or other items, it may seek to obtain such during the cross-examination, but the oral proof or oral evidence is the most important in a trial, and here we have a witness who is telling us orally what he knows.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, this is an interview.  This is not a written document.  The proof of the facts in the interview is on the tape and not on the document where the tape was transcribed.  That is clear.  The proof is -- the evidence is the audiotape.  It is not the document on which this was transcribed.  It is not possible.  It is not admissible. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, do you have this audiotape of your brief interview or conversation with Father Seromba?  Do you have a tape of it? 
THE WITNESS:
No, I don't have it because it was not an interview.  It was just a conversation.  We were planning to make the interview later on, and that's what happened.  After one half hour, two hours, they made the interview with Alessandro Antico, and that interview was taped.  That was just a conversation to see if it was available to make the interview.  In fact, I didn't write an interview about that.  I'm just telling you this meeting, how it was. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You stated that this journalist works with La Nazione; do you?  You also stated that you heard or listened to this tape and that this tape is a recording of what Father Seromba said to you during your brief conversation with him.  Is that it? 
THE WITNESS:
It's basically the same thing that he told me, but the tape was regarding the conversation between Alessandro Antico and Father Seromba, not my conversation; the conversation that he had with him.  But basically he said the same things, more or less.  The conversation with Alessandro Antico, I think, was longer. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
For the reasons that you have given us, we shall hear your testimony in this case.  Of course, this is based on Rule 89, and we shall weigh what evidentiary value we shall attach to your testimony.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Pognon. 
MR. POGNON:
I respectfully submit that the Trial Chamber recognise -- or should recognise that the Defence has contested, has challenged this journalist witness because he has not brought any audio-visual recording of the conversation that he claims to have had with my client.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
The transcript will show this, Counsel Pognon. 

Madam Prosecutor.
MS. ARBIA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MS. ARBIA:
Q.	So we shall begin with the English text of the article published by Alessandro Antico.  First, I shall ask you, as a reporter, can you confirm that this article is in question and answer form, that is, in interview form?
A.	Yes, it is.
Q.	I shall ask you to take up the document once more, which is K0246433 in the French. 
A.	(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Sorry, interpreter is sorry.  That was my mistake. 
BY MS. ARBIA:
Q.	Yes, this is the English version.  Please go to line 11.  This includes the title and the first lines.  In line 11, you will find the question which is as follows:  "...the massacre in the village of Nyange where you were parish priest."
MR. POGNON:
Objection, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Pognon. 
MR. POGNON:
This interview, which is reported on by Alessandro Antico, is not the work of this witness, and the Tribunal is allowing this to be placed before this witness, and he is answering questions based on that.  I would like the Court to register my objection.  I don't know what this is about.  This journalist is not the person who is conducting the interview, and he is going to be asked questions based on this interview.  This has never happened.
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, I do not think that -- there is no reason for me to answer because you have already given a decision on this matter.  The transcript will reflect the objections of the Defence, so with your leave, I would like to proceed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We take due notice of Counsel Pognon's submission.  Madam Prosecutor, you may proceed. 
MS. ARBIA:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours. 
BY MS. ARBIA:
Q.	So, Witness, I have quoted a question of the journalist in the text.  Can you confirm that you heard this question in the recording?
A.	Yes.
Q.	I shall proceed, and I shall quote the passage which apparently is the answer to that question, and it follows immediately after the question: "...the 14th and 16th April 1994.  But I left the village on the 6th April.  I wasn't there when the massacre was committed."  

Do you remember that this was the answer that Father Seromba gave from what you remember of the recording?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Later down -- or lower down in the same text, around the 26th line, there is another question, which I shall quote:  "You are accused for attending a meeting of the special committee for security before the massacre on the 13th April.  Is that true?"  

Witness, have you been able to find the passage in the text?
A.	I have it here.
Q.	Based on your recollection, did you hear this tape or this question on the tape?
A.	Yes.
Q.	I continue: "That is not possible.  I repeat, I left Nyange on the 6th April.  It is all documented.  How could I have been in Nyange on the 13th April?" 

Do you remember that this answer given by Father Seromba was on the tape that you listened to?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, I respectfully request that the article signed Alessandro Antico, whose K-number I have given but which I can repeat, if necessary, be entered as Prosecution exhibit.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objection on the part of the Defence?
MR. POGNON:
Of course.  Of course I object.  It is the very first time before this court that a document is given to a witness, and he is investigated -- or sorry, examined based on a document placed before him such as this.  It is the first time, and I object. 

Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Pognon, yes, you have the floor.
MR. POGNON:
Yes.  I have a duty to recall before this Court that in the morning we had a police officer here.  I produced a document from the Italian state police, and the Trial Chamber refused to admit this document; whereas, the witness himself acknowledged the collaboration between his department of immigration and the state police, so I would like to recall for the record and for this Trial Chamber that this was the case. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We should like to draw to your attention that the transcript will also show that this document was not recognized by this witness who's said that he had just seen it.  So in regard to this document, we shall enter it, but we are going to enter it as a newspaper article, and we shall determine subsequently what its evidentiary value is. 
MS. ARBIA:
First, this document will be entered as P. 18. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This document is entered as P. 18.
(Exhibit No. P. 18 admitted)
MS. ARBIA:
Thank you, Madam President.  Just one clarification. 
BY MS. ARBIA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, when and on what date did your conversation with Father Seromba take place?
A.	It was the day before the publication of the first article, so it was the 20 of November 1999.  It was in the parish where he was attending.  So the parish was the parish of Pieza dell' Immacolata in Montughi in Florence. 
Q.	If you are able to tell, on what date and where was the interview by Alessandro Antico conducted?
MR. POGNON:
It is written on the newspaper that he has before him.  It is there. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, please, please.  Right now it is Madam Prosecutor who has the floor.
MR. POGNON:
I am very sorry.  I am very sorry.  It gets on my nerves to see this.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is just important that it be included in the transcript.  You may put forth your point of view during the cross-examination of this witness. 
MS. ARBIA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MS. ARBIA:
Q.	You may answer, Mr. Witness.
A.	I want to say to the Defence, the article is not written when it was made.  It's written where it was made but not when it was made.  I can say when it was made; it was made the day before when it was published, so the 20 of November 1999.
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, Your Honours, I have no further questions in examination-in-chief.  I thank you, and I would like to thank the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We shall now turn to the Defence.  

Counsel Monthé, you have the floor. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, Your Honours, good afternoon.  

Good afternoon, Mr. Farruggia.
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Mr. Farruggia, you may or may not know, but I am called Patrice Monthé.  I am co-counsel for Patrice Monthé (sic) along with Mr. Pognon, lead counsel.  I am going to put questions to you regarding what you know about Father Seromba, and also based on the questions put to you by Madam Prosecutor.  If for any reason, you do not understand any of my questions, be so kind as to tell me so that I can rephrase it.  If you are ready, please tell me so that we can begin.
A.	Yes, I'm ready.  When you want.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Mr. Witness, you have told this distinguished Trial Chamber that you were a journalist at the daily newspaper La Nazione.  Can you tell us what were your duties as a member of staff of this newspaper?
A.	I'm a reporter.  I'm working, and at that time I was also working in the Roman office of La Nazione. 
Q.	Very well.  That means that you are not in any way involved in the management, are you?
A.	I am not involved in the management, correct.
Q.	Were you involved in the editing?
A.	No, I am not.
Q.	Thank you.  Can you tell us this Trial Chamber the circulation of your newspaper?
A.	The article's circulation, you mean the copies sold or the copy that we print? 
Q.	What you do sell; that's what I'm interested in.
A.	180,000 copies La Nazione.
Q.	And you stated that you are based in Rome, Bologna, and Florence -- Bologna, sorry, and Florence.  Is that correct?
A.	No, not correct.  In Milan, Bologna, and Florence, because we have three newspaper: La Giornale from Milan, Resto Del Carlino from Bologna, and La Nazione  from Florence. 
Q.	Please forgive the error.  I did not hear Milan and Rome.  Could you tell the Trial Chamber how many newspapers were distributed in Florence; that is, what was sold in Florence, the Nazione?
A.	Well, it's difficult to say.  I would say probably 60,000, more or less.
Q.	Thank you.  Sir, for how long have you been a reporter?
A.	Since 1987 I'm a professional journalist, but I was working as a journalist even before.
Q.	Very well.  For how long have you been interested in the events of Rwanda?
A.	As far as I know, I did not write any article about Rwanda before this article that I wrote in 1992 (sic).  I was writing not about foreign policy at that time.
Q.	You know that word -- the question is for how long have you been interested in Rwanda.  It is not the number of articles that you have written that I'm interested in.  So may I take it that when you wrote the article, you were becoming interested in the events in Rwanda?
A.	No.   I was reading about the events in Rwanda and knowing about the events in Rwanda, let's say, basically since the genocide of 1994.
Q.	Very well.  To edify this Trial Chamber and for the record, shall we say then that you became interested in Rwanda in 1994?  Shall we take it that way?
A.	Yes, as a reader and as a journalist, but this does not produce articles about it.
Q.	Very well.  May I also take it that your knowledge of Rwanda is based on what you gleaned from other articles, based on reports, that is?
A.	Yes, correct.  I have never been in Rwanda, unfortunately.
Q.	Very good.  But you are a reporter?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Very good.  As rule of a reporter in a paper, isn't it to go down to the field to follow the events?
A.	Only when my editor order me to do it.  I'm not the editor of my newspaper.
Q.	Fine.  Since you wrote that article, have you been to Rwanda?
A.	No.  As I told you, I have never been to Rwanda.
Q.	All right.  How many times have you met Father Seromba?
A.	Once.
Q.	Were you all by yourself?  Were you alone?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Very good.  At that time, did you interview him?
A.	I spoke with him, yes.  It was not a formal interview.  I would not call it an interview.  In fact, I did not write an article as an interview.
Q.	Mr. Journalist, let us be specific.  You are the journalist.  Did you interview him?  I think an interview principle is questions and answers.  Was that it?
A.	We can discuss about this.  As a journalist, for me, an interview is something that is finalised to be published in a newspaper.  That was -- I would call it -- I don't know the word now in English -- a speech with him for to understand if he was able to -- if he wanted to make an interview.  It was not a technical interview. 
(Pages 34 to 45 by Kelsey Farnalls)


























	1545H
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Okay.
A.	And because the Court asks me and I tell, but I did not write anything about that -- about this speech that I made with Mr. Seromba. 
Q.	Mr. Farrugia, I must ask you questions so that the Chamber can assess your statements, insofar as the credibility is concerned, so please try to listen to my questions which I hope will be interesting to you as well as for me.
A.	(Microphones overlapping)
Q.	Thank you.  And I am touched by that.  Now, for the record, should we admit that Father Seromba accepted to hold a conversation with you knowingly or was he -- or didn't he accept?
A.	Yes, he accepted.  He was --
Q.	Very good.  Thank you.  Tell me, you told us that, indeed, information on Father Seromba, you got them from the Sunday Times, one of your colleagues, I think the name is John Follane if I remember well, that he, himself, got information from the association African Rights; is that correct?
A.	John Follane told me that there was this paper from African Rights and I asked him to send me a copy.  He gave me a telephone number from African Rights.  I asked them a copy of their material and they sent it to me, if I remember, by mail, and then I saw the material.  It was not John Follane that gave me the material, but it was African Rights.  But, John Follane, yes, gave me the information that the material was ready. 
Q.	Very good.  You had the African Rights report with you.
A.	Of course.
Q.	Okay.  And what did you do?  Did you verify the information?
A.	I read the report and then I, as I told, I spoke with our former correspondent in England, former because we don't have any more correspondence in England, and asked information about this NGO.
Q.	Mr. Farrugia, the African Right report is sizable.  There are innumerable witnesses that were cited therein.  Did you take care to get in touch with those people or to go to the scene that the charge sheet No. 2 talked about?  Did you do that as a journalist reporter?
A.	Unfortunately, it was not possible for me. 
Q.	Very good.  We can therefore consider that you did not crosscheck the information since the people who spoke were inaccessible to you.
A.	Exactly.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, can you tell the Chamber, on the basis of a report that you had with you and people who spoke on that report for African Rights, you didn't hear them?  Can you say that you could write a relevant article -- or can you write an article on relevant issues using that material?
A.	I did not write an article where I say that Father Seromba was responsible.  I'd write an article where I said that African Rights says that he's responsible and that someone -- this was my (unintelligible) should check if what African Rights says is true or not. 
Q.	I can deduce from that that you, yourself, wrote something you did not know.
A.	I have a certain number of testimonies that were quoted from African Rights that say that.  I did not take the part of African Rights.  It is not my role.  I am a journalist.  I only refer that there is a report from African Rights.  Let's say that, and that maybe a court like is happening now should investigate on this.  I don't have the instruments to do it; the Court has.
Q.	You told me you became interested in the problems in Rwanda.  You learnt that Father Seromba was in Florence.  Where would you -- someone else, Mr. Antico, who is not here today, to go and interview Father Seromba instead, whereas, you're the one who was interested in the problems in Rwanda.
A.	Sorry, I don't understand the question.
Q.	I will repeat the question to you: you told the Chamber that you became interested in the problems in Rwanda and this is since 1994.  You got information coming from London and you acquainted yourself with it.  Why did you not conduct interviews, but you asked Mr. Antico to go and conduct an interview instead of yourself?
A.	It is an explanation of, let's say, editorial policy.  I am working -- and I am trying to explain myself -- I am working in a Roman office of my newspapers, with my three newspapers.  It's customary that all the issues related with something, that is, that happens in Florence or in Bologna or Milan, is written by a journalist from the newspaper that stays there.  So I had the news, so my newspaper wanted that I wrote the main story, but I also wanted that the journalist from the newspaper, from La Nazione, wrote the interview.  So on the same page we have an article made from the journalist from Redactione of Florence, the newsroom from Florence, and an article from the journalist who took the information which is me.  A sort of balance if you want.
Q.	That is it.  Indeed, we don't know but we call from here and there and we write an article.  That is what all the balancing is about.
A.	It's an internal balance of my newspaper.  That's it.
Q.	Mr. Farrugia, do you know the charter regulating the duties of journalists assigned in Rome on the 18th of June 1993 by the national council of journalists?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Does it prescribe many rules or principles to be observed by a journalist?
A.	Is it a question?
Q.	Of course.
A.	Yes, of course.  It prescribes that the information should be balanced and equilibrated and so on.  I cannot quote the -- now.  I don't have any --
Q.	If I were to refresh your memory, what does article 3 of that chapter state?  Doesn't it invoke the presumption of innocence?
A.	Yes, that's why we decided to make an interview on the same day to Father Seromba and not the day after; the same day.
Q.	Mr. Farrugia, I am going to show the Chamber because I think this is the only photocopy that I have that should make it -- that can be used, and I'm going to request from you that you tell us what the title of that article means in Italian. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Please, can you show that to the Prosecutor.  Unfortunately, I have only one photocopy.  We're always on the run.  I am sorry if I haven't been able to photocopy it in several copies.
THE WITNESS:
Shall I translate it in English? 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	For all of us to understand it, please, do that.
A.	It's in Italy.  The priest that killed thousands of Tutsis.
Q.	Very good.  Now, you have just told me that you read article 3 on the presumption of innocence.  And when you put a heading or title like that in your paper, do you think that your article is impartial?
A.	The article is absolutely impartial.  I have to tell you that I didn't wrote the title, anyway, but on the other part -- the upper part of the title, it is written, denounced from the daily English newspaper, Sunday times, and so, so, so.  It's quoted from the Sunday times, but I didn't wrote the title; I wrote the article only. 
Q.	Mr. Farrugia, if you did not write anything, then what have you come to tell the Tribunal?  You did not draft the title, you did not draft the interview.  In the end you didn't draft or write anything.
A.	I simply wrote the main article and I arranged the interview with Father Seromba, that's it.  The only thing that I didn't wrote was the title and the interview that is written by Alessandro Antico.  That's it.  I also have to say that on this page there are three articles and two articles reflect the position of Mr. Seromba.  Just one that does not.  This is regarding your question about the journalist in their duties.
Q.	Mr. Farrugia, when you receive information from the Sunday times of London, did you know that Father Seromba could be prosecuted for those offences or deeds?
A.	I did not know.  I supposed that it could be in theory, yes, but I did not know.
Q.	That is it.  That is it.  But when you put a title which says the priest who killed thousands of Tutsis, you didn't think for one second that that could have a legal or judicial consequences?
A.	As I told you I did not wrote any title, and I did not put any title.  And on the title there is written, the annonce is from the British newspaper.  It's probably because they had not enough space, they did not put the quotes on the left and on the right, but it is written on the upper part.  But the annonce of the English newspaper, Sunday times. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Farrugia.  Should I infer from that that the honour of a person can be compared to the space that a paper has available?
A.	As I told you, we found -- we had the sensibility to ask Mr. Seromba, the same day, his position.  It often happens that newspapers write things accusing someone, and then the day after ask the person his point of view.  We did it on the same day.  There is also, now, another article from Fides which is the Catholic church agency about the missions.  There is another interview to Father Bernard do Cervellera.  That said, the accused is from the African Rights association were not true.  So it was -- it is - there is -- Father Seromba that says it is not true and there is also the -- let's say, the Catholic church that says it is not true.  I think we balance quite well.  We should have put the quotes.  Maybe you're right, but for the rest it is okay.  It's my position.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Farrugia. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, after these questions I would like to pray your Chamber respectfully to enter this magazine article as Defence Exhibit under reference No. D. 38, I suppose.  Madam President, I am only quoting from my memory.  I think it should be D. 38, the reference number for this exhibit.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor. 
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, if I heard him well, this is a document in Italian, so to admit it into evidence I think the -- we must show some hesitance here because I don't quite see the use for admitting it into evidence since the official languages are French and English.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, this morning we heard somebody speak in Spanish and nobody said anything.  What she said was translated, and I think the same measures will be taken to ensure that the Italian is translated.  There should be no problem with that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This page of the newspaper is entered as Defence exhibit and reference number D. 38.  I will request the language services to do all to translate this document into one of the official languages.
(Exhibit No. D. 38, admitted)
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Mr. Farrugia, have you had your glass of water?  Can we go ahead?  Can you tell me -- the Prosecutor when -- in taking up an Italian document that was translated into French -- by the way, I see that the translation hasn't been certified.  We all have translation problems.  In one of the questions you gave the names of two witnesses.  Do you have the document before you?
A.	Just a second.
Q.	In the English document, I think, it should be question No. 15 for you.
A.	Yes, I have it.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, are you on that document already?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we are there. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Mr. Farrugia, I would like to understand, as the lay person I am, you are a journalist.  A priest is accused, and you are told that two persons said the following: did it occur to you to try to see those people whose names were mentioned?
A.	Yes, unfortunately, as I told you, it was not possible for me to do it, and it was not possible even to Alessandro Antico.  We asked African Rights if it was possible -- if they had the possibility to keep us in contact with them, and it was not possible, and we had not the opportunity for economic reason to go to Rwanda and try to speak with these people. 
Q.	You therefore took what African Rights said for granted under the circumstances?
A.	No.  We said that the newspaper and African Rights say that, and we asked Mr. Seromba to answer to what they say.  We don't say that this persons say the true, but we take seriously what they said, and ask to Mr. Seromba to give an answer to them to what they said.  That's it. 
Q.	I will like to understand and I believe the Chamber too would also like to understand.  You said that you did not consider the information as true, but you served it out to the public.  So in the spirit of your Italian readers, who read that article, didn't they understand that Father Seromba was guilty of those charges?
A.	No, I think and I really hope they understand that he was accused by an association to be guilty of terrible charges. 
Q.	Mr. Farrugia, you tell us that you were interested in the problems in Rwanda.  Father Seromba was the parish priest of the -- was the priest in the Nyange parish.  Did you try to obtain, at least, documentary information talking about the events in Nyange apart from African Rights?  Which newspaper or which document did you consult that had some authority before writing your article?
A.	I made a research on the internet for -- look for documents about the facts of Nyange, and I found documents that proved that they were - there was a massacre in Nyange, and no quotation about any role about Father Seromba.
Q.	But you say that he told you that he fled, he left Nyange by the 6th of April.  Is that what he told you?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Very good.  Now, how about your research on the internet.  Did your research collaborate that statement or that point which is very crucial?
A.	Not at all.  The search was only about the existence of a massacre in Nyange.  That's it.  I could not imagine to find on the internet anything about a role of the parish -- of the church of Nyange.  I mean, you can find nearly everything on the internet, but not on that scale. 
Q.	Thank you.  The Tribunal will weigh the evidence.  Since you were interested in the events in Rwanda, were you also interested in the subtlety of the Rwandan language that is called Kinyarwanda?
A.	No.
Q.	Very good.  So when you read witness statements in the African Rights charge sheets, you appreciated it from the standpoint of Italian?
A.	Yes, they were written in English, yes.
Q.	Were you able to know or to learn who were the persons or the clerics who were in the Nyange parish during the period of the events?
A.	You mean the persons that were inside the church?  They were Tutsi.
Q.	No, I was talking about clerics, members of the clergy, apart from Father Seromba.  In your research, were you able to learn whether there were other clerics or priests in the Nyange parish during the time of the events?
A.	I understand.  No, not at all.
Q.	Very good.  Thank you, sir.  Mr. Farrugia, you mentioned African Rights -- you said at African Rights.  How much credit did you journalists give to that newspaper?  Tell the Chamber this.
A.	How much credit did I give to African Rights?  Well, I took it as an NGO.  NGOs sometimes are reliable, sometimes not.  What they say should always be proved.  Anyway, I spoke with my colleague which was working in London and told me that they were respectable.
Q.	Thank you.  If I were to tell you that certain persons came here a few days ago and told us that African Rights did not write down what they told them, what do you say of the credibility, or do you maintain what you think of the credibility of that association?
A.	It is only possible.  I remember that a couple of years ago -- two or three years ago -- I wrote a quotation from Rapport de Reporters sans frontiéres that was saying that African Rights sometimes is too close to the position of the Tutsi and against the Hutu.  So it's not the first that I heard. 
Q.	It is not the first time that you're hearing that, but you maintained a sensational title all the same.  When I talk about you, I am referring to the newspaper.
A.	(Microphones overlapping)... sensational title that I did not wrote.  I was made quoting a research from African Rights and from the Sunday Times who said, "African Rights said this", and we made an interview on the same day with Father Seromba.  Yes, I think it was basically correct. 
Q.	Very good.  You have just stated that on the strength of a report or indications from Rapport de Reporters sans frontiéres which is a serious organisation for journalists, it would appear to me we agree on that because I see you acquiescing.  Do we agree on that?
A.	(No answer)
Q.	Very good.  Now, you read the name of Rapport de Reporters sans frontiéres and you know the proximity of African Rights and the powers or the authorities in Kigali, but you didn't have any reservations when you were preparing the articles in question. 
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, I realise that the question does not actually reflect the previous answer of the witness.
MR. MONTHÉ:
I did not understand your objection, Madam Prosecutor.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor, do you want to repeat your statement?  
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, I realise that this question does not reflect correctly the previous answer of the witness.
MR. MONTHÉ:
I still haven't understood.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Prosecutor is saying that your question does not follow correctly from the previous answer of the witness.
MR. MONTHÉ:
So I am going to repeat it.  

Madam President, what I heard from the witness, except I'm mistaken once again, I heard him say that he drafted or wrote a note on behalf of Rapport de Reporters sans frontiéres - on the account of (French spoken) frontiéres, and that information that he had from Rapport de Reporters sans frontiéres were stating that African Rights had positions that were close to the Tutsi as against the Hutus; is that clear?
THE WITNESS:
I read this, I think, two years ago.  So, basically, two or three years after the -- I wrote the article, I read it because I made the research when Father Seromba decided to submit to the court.  So I made research by myself on the internet to see if there was any update, and I found this article quoting Rapport de Reporters sans frontiéres that say that this association sometimes is too much close to the Tutsis -- more close to the Tutsis than the Hutus.  It was probably in 2001 or maybe 2002 that I wrote this -- sorry, that I read this; I didn't wrote anything.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Very well.  I thank you.  Did you continue your research on the internet since it is a toll of reference -- a toll of choice today?  Did your research confirm the fact that African Rights position is closer to that of the Tutsis than to the Hutus?
A.	I have no idea who said that.  And I should make a research on this.  And I had no time for do this.  And I should go on the ground and speak with the people and speak with the organisation and so on.  I'm not able to say now. 
Q.	I thank you.  Tell me, in appearing before this Chamber, to enlighten the Chamber in respect of Father Seromba, are you confident that they would deal with the tragedy that occurred in Rwanda?
A.	Yes.
Q.	You are aware that this Chamber was going to deal with the tragedy in Rwanda.
A.	Yes.
Q.	And you did not want to do research before coming here?
A.	(Microphone overlapping)... Father Seromba, yes.  You know, the case of Father Seromba is not only my activity; I have to work usually.  So I can do it as an activity, but not my main activity.  If I do it as my main activity, I should go to Rwanda and investigate on this, but I am not an investigator; I am a journalist.  I have to work on other things.  In my spare time I can also make my researches.
Q.	I thank you, but there is a problem.  You have been called to appear before this Chamber because you are supposed to know what you wrote about and enlighten the Chamber.  As you can see, I do not spend the whole year working on the Seromba case, and yet I am here.  What is of interest to us is that you should tell the truth so that the Chamber should be edified.  So if you do not know the truth you are not in a position to come and testify, Mr. Farrugia.
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, I object.  The counsel for Defence is arguing with the witness.  Counsel Pognon -- Counsel Pognon is seated.  I meant Counsel Monthé.  I am sorry.   
MR. MONTHÉ:
I am also sorry. 
MS. ARBIA:
Before this witness was called, the subject of his evidence was discussed and we thought the subject was clearly defined.  So he has to be questioned on the events that occurred in Rwanda in 1994 and I don't think we are outside of the field of that evidence. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I am the one who is asking questions here and I read the summary in which there was nothing.  You did not answer the question put to you by the Chamber, so allow me to continue cross-examining the witness.  And it doesn't serve any purpose if you keep hammering on that point.
THE WITNESS:
(Microphones overlapping)... I will answer to every question without any problem.  You can give me any question when you want and I will always answer to you.  Every question, no problem. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution.
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, I find it very surprising that my learned friend for the Defence says that I did not answer your question; I answered your question twice.  I say that it was going to be the subject of this witnesses evidence.  You can verify that in the transcripts and you will weigh the evidence for yourself. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This incident is closed.  I believe that this morning we took the decision after hearing both parties and would like to press on.  

Counsel, do you have any other questions for the witness? 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, Madam President.  I wish to wrap things up and I would like to proceed. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, the objection wasn't addressed to you.  I was merely responding to that objection from the Prosecution and I thank you for your readiness to answer my questions.  

Let me return to what I was saying.  In light of Seromba's case, were you able to find out the fate reserved by the Rwandan government to suspects who face the charges we mentioned a while ago?
A.	I presume to know the fate, yes.
Q.	Did you see the way judicial positions were prepared by the government of Rwanda?
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, I object to this question.  There is no basis established for this question.  There is no article written by this journalist, that has been mentioned by the Defence, so the question is not admissible. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you respond to the objection, Counsel. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I don't know what the Prosecutor wants to hear.  I asked the witness whether, in light of Seromba's case, he was able to find out how judicial documents and case documents are prepared by the authorities in Rwanda, that is in light of Seromba's case.  I'm speaking French, Madam President.  In light of Seromba's case, did he find out how the Rwandan government lays charges?  He is there and he can say yes or no depending on what he thinks of my question.
THE WITNESS:
No problem.  I did not read any document prepared by the Rwandan government about the Seromba case. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Very well.  Did you read or see other documents on trials?
A.	You mean in Rwanda?
Q.	Of course.
A.	I have not.  I have not. 
Q.	Very well.  Did you receive any information on relations between the clerics and the authorities in Rwanda in your research as a journalist, still in connection with the cases in Rwanda?
A.	Relations of which type?  Sorry, I don't understand.
Q.	I will simplify the question.  In your opinion, do you know what the relations between the state in Kigali and the church, or members of the church according to any research you may have carried out?

MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, the question is too vague, too broad, and it is not specific with regard to the era you are referring to. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
I want to point out to you that the genocide dates back to 1994.  He says that he has been interested in Rwanda since 1994 and that he was conducted investigations since Father Seromba was there.  I've asked them whether he's carried out research and knows the state of relations between the Rwandan state and the church.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, I believe you understand what I'm saying?
A.	Yes, I understand, but I'm not an expert in Rwanda.  I am used to say what I know.  And I don't want to make a speculation on things that I don't know, or that I don't know enough, or that I know as second-hand news.  I have my personal opinion about the relations in between the government and the militias, the former government, and this -- and my opinion about the relations in between the church and the government.  My opinions are not relevant about the Seromba case in my opinion.  I have any proof.  I mean, I have any proof.  And I like to speak about facts and proofs.

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, could the witness speak a little slower for the interpreters to follow?
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Very well.  As regards the issue of evidence, at any given time when you were writing your articles, apart from the documents of human rights, did you have any other materials -- did you work on any other materials, apart from documents from African Rights?
A.	About the case of Father Seromba, I found in recent times the transcripts of the trial which are on the Internet, and I read some books, but not referring to the Seromba case; some books on Rwanda, yes.
Q.	Mr. Farruggia, all the information you received, looking at it, did you have the feeling that it corresponded to the reality of the events that occurred in Nyange in 1994?
A.	Before the events in Nyange, I didn't found much material.  About the events in Rwanda, yes, I would say, more or less, it refers to the reality.  It refers to the terrible genocide that happened in that country, unfortunately.
Q.	Since that period, have you received other information on Father Seromba and, if need be, particularly with regard to Nyange, can you provide it to the Chamber?
A.	No, I don't have any other information about his presence in Nyange.
Q.	Very well.  So we end with the charge sheets of African Rights.
A.	Yes, that's it.
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  
A.	Consider that I wrote only four articles in three days about that, so it was difficult even for a matter of time to find something else.  Since 1999 to now, I didn't wrote any more about Father Seromba.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I thank you for your keenness to tell the truth.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, Your Honours, I have no further questions for the witness.  I thank you for your patience.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Counsel Monthé.

Counsel for the Prosecution, do you have any questions for the witness in re-examination?
MS. ARBIA:
No, Madam President, I have no questions in re-examination.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we thank you for coming forward to give evidence.  And you have been very patient to our questions.  We thank you for that, and we wish you a safe journey back home.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you very much.
(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, this brings us to the end of the evidence of the last witness for this session.  We would like to know whether the parties would like to hold the status conference tomorrow morning, in which case we could hold it at 10 a.m. if you do not mind.  Is ten o'clock okay for both parties?
MR. POGNON:
Yes, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So we thank you.  We meet tomorrow at 10 a.m. in this same courtroom.

Good afternoon to you all.

The Court stands adjourned.
(Court adjourned at 1650H)
