P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  Witness, we remind you that you are still testifying under oath.  And Counsel for the Prosecution will proceed with his examination-in-chief.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Ma'am President, please, we are having problems with the earsets.  There is a buzz in them.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, it is still buzzing.  If the problem could be sorted out by the technicians, we would appreciate.  Well, we'll try to start.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Nothing has changed.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Let us hope things get better.  We'll try to start.  Counsel for the Prosecution, you have the floor.
MR. TOWNSEND:
May it please the Chamber.  Thank you very much, Your Honours. 
WITNESS CBJ
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness CBJ, when you first arrived to Nyange parish seeking refuge, where did you sleep?
A.	I spent the night inside the Sisters of the Assumptions convent in Nyange. 
Q.	And where did you first stay when you arrived at the Nyange church complex?
A.	Could you please, Prosecutor, repeat your question?
Q.	On 10 April 1994, when you arrived in Nyange parish, where did you sleep?
A.	I spent the night in the presbytery where there is a catechism school.
Q.	At some point during your refuge at the Nyange church complex, did you sleep somewhere else besides the presbytery, yes or no?
A.	I slept only at the presbytery and nowhere else.
Q.	Were there other Tutsi refugees staying where you were staying when you arrived at the Nyange parish; that's at the presbytery?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did there come a time when you and other Tutsi refugees left that place for sleeping?
A.	Yes.  We left that place at one time. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, we did not at all hear the question, please.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, could you please repeat your question. 

MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	The question was, did this witness and the other Tutsi refugees from the presbytery at some point sleep somewhere else or move out of the presbytery, to which I think this witness answered yes?
A.	Yes.  At one time we had to leave that place in order to spend a night elsewhere.
Q.	Why did you have to leave that place?
A.	We left that place because of leaders of Interhamwe from Kivumu commune and because of Father Athanase Seromba and the gendarmes.
Q.	You mentioned Father Seromba.  Did you hear him say anything, yes or no?
A.	Yes.  He said something --
Q.	Please tell us.
A.	-- in that regard.  Before relating what he said, I would first of all request you to allow me to tell you what happened before he made those statements.
Q.	If you can explain briefly, please tell us the words you heard.
A.	First of all, the representatives of the Interhamwe and Father Seromba had held a meeting.  Thereafter, we harvested bananas from the priests' banana plantation because we were hungry.  Towards the evening -- excuse me, excuse me.  Towards the evening, we harvested those bananas.  The representatives of the Interhamwe, the priest, and the gendarmes were together.  And the priest told us to go inside the church because he said we were beginning to cause problems.  So we went inside the church.  Then he asked all the people who were in the various locations of the presbytery to go inside the church.  Those were the statements he made.  I therefore made a mistake because after we were shut up in the church, that was when they held their meeting, after we went into the church. 
Q.	Thank you.  What is the sacristy, or what is a sacristy?
A.	The sacristy is a place where chalices containing the Host are kept.
Q.	Did you ever go near the sacristy on that day?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And when you were there, did you see anyone else?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Who did you see?
A.	I saw Father Athanase Seromba.
Q.	What did you see him do, if anything?
A.	After asking us to get into the church, he came in, took the priests' psalters -- he took the chalices full of communion, and then he left the church. 
Q.	Did he take the chalices and Host or Eucharists only, or anything else?
A.	He also took the psalters that priests wear when they are celebrating mass.
Q.	Where did you see him go with those items?
A.	He went out with those items.  I did not follow him, but I heard it said, and I believe it is true, he took the items to the presbytery. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter would like to correct, psalter means cassock.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Yes.  Can you recall on which day that took place?
A.	It was a Thursday, 14th of April 1994, in the evening.
Q.	And the previous incident which you described in which Seromba asked the refugees to leave, do you recall on which day that took place?
A.	I have not quite understood your question, Mr. Prosecutor.
Q.	Earlier today you told us that Seromba said words to the effect that the Tutsis needed to leave the presbytery because they were causing problems.  Do you recall on which day Seromba said those words?
A.	Yes.  I recall the day on which he uttered those words.
Q.	Please say that date.
A.	It was a Thursday.  It was on Thursday, 14th of April 1994.
Q.	On the evening of 14 April 1994, was the front door of the church open, closed, or locked?
A.	After taking the items I made mention of, he immediately locked us up inside the church.
Q.	Can you say the name of the person who locked you up, please?
A.	The person who locked us up was Father Athanase Seromba.
Q.	Who had the key to that front church door?
A.	It was Father Athanase Seromba.
Q.	Did you see any other persons present with Seromba when he closed the front church door?
A.	He was in the company of gendarmes.
Q.	Anyone else, or that's it?
A.	I did not pay attention to what happened thereafter.
Q.	You mentioned earlier today a meeting.  Can you explain to the Court what you saw, please?
A.	Regarding that meeting, I did not attend that meeting, of course.  I was not near them, I mean those who were participating in the meeting.  But from where I was standing, I could very well see the participants.  I could see them.  Furthermore, when he locked us up in the church, it was to enable them to hold a meeting.  He locked us up so that we couldn't get close to them.
Q.	Can you please tell us the names of those persons you saw meeting, if you recall?
A.	Yes, I can give you their names.
Q.	Please give us the names. 
A.	First of all, there was Father Athanase Seromba; Ndahimana, Grégoire, the bourgmestre; judicial police inspector, Fulgence Kayishema; Telésphore Ndungutse; Gaspard Kanyarukiga, a businessman; Christophe Mbakirirehe, brigadier; and many others whom I was unable to identify.
Q.	Where did you see those persons gather?
A.	They were closer to Father Seromba, whom they found on the second floor.  What I was saying, therefore, was that I saw them while I was standing, and they were on the second floor. 
Q.	Where were you when you saw that?
A.	I believe if I were to give the answer to that question, it could reveal my identity.  I therefore do not know whether you will allow me to give my answer in closed session.
MR. TOWNSEND:
I'll ask that later, Your Honours, in a closed session, and I'll move to the next question. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	After the meeting, what did you see happen?
A.	After that meeting, at about 7 p.m., we saw a large number of people enter.  They were accompanied by gendarmes, and they came to search our belongings.  They took our traditional weapons, such as sticks and machetes. 
Q.	Were those gendarmes armed or not?
A.	They were armed.
Q.	Can you tell us where you were when you saw that?
A.	I was inside the church.
Q.	On what date did that seizure of traditional weapons take place?
A.	It was on Thursday, 14th of April 1994, in the evening.
Q.	I'd like you to turn your attention to the following day, Friday, the 15th of April 1994, and, yes or no, did you see Father Seromba that day?
A.	I also saw him.
Q.	What did you see Seromba doing?
A.	On the 15th of April 1994, the leaders of the Interhamwe of the Kivumu commune came back to look for Father Seromba.  Once again, they went up to the first floor and conferred with the priest.  After their discussions, they came back down and went to the Codekoki operative.
Q.	What did you see take place at Codekoki with those persons?
A.	They held a meeting at that Codekoki operative building, but this time around, there was a good number of people.  But those people were Interhamwe.
Q.	Can you estimate for how long you think that meeting lasted?
A.	The meeting lasted more than 30 minutes -- lasted for more than 30 minutes.
Q.	You mentioned seeing a large group of people.  Where were they?
A.	All those people were in front of the Codekoki operative in the centre of Nyange.
Q.	You mentioned Interhamwe.  What led you to believe that some of them were Interhamwe?
A.	Yes.  I maintain that they were Interhamwe because one hour later -- they spent one hour on that spot, and one hour later they started killing us.
Q.	After the meeting and before the attack, did you notice anyone arrive to Nyange?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Please explain briefly. 
A.	Other persons who arrived at Nyange are people like Edward Nturiye, a priest; another priest called Kayiranga. 
Q.	By what mode of transport did those people arrive?
A.	Those priests came in a bus from Kibuye, in which were also soldiers, Interhamwe.  When they arrived at the Nyange centre, they joined the group of the many other people that I mentioned earlier.  The soldiers also came down, and the priests came down and started talking to those people that they met at the place.  And sometime later, that is when they carried out the attack against us and started killing us.
Q.	After the meeting you mentioned at Codekoki, did you see the authorities go anywhere?
A.	Father Seromba came back after the meeting.  He returned to the presbytery, and after him, the -- or after the gendarmes started shooting in the air.  And that is how the soldiers or the gendarmes started killing us.  So it is Interhamwe who started killing the refugees.
Q.	Can you briefly describe what happened during this attack?
A.	At the beginning of the attack, they had first of all brought truckloads of stones.  They had thrown those stones in front of Codekoki in Nyange, and started by throwing the stones at us.  They threw stones at us.  So we took bricks and also started to defend ourselves.  And when they were throwing the stones, they were also retreating.  So we followed them.  And when we got to the Nyange center, a soldier -- a corporal called Rukara started throwing grenades in our midst.  Some of us fell, while others fled towards the church.  They followed us to the church.  I believe I can stop here for now.
Q.	You've mentioned already grenades and guns and stones.  What other weapons did you see used that day?
A.	They were also carrying spears, machetes, swords, bamboo stakes.
MR. POGNON:
At a certain point he said, "They followed us to the church."  I would like some clarification there on that "They followed us to the church."  I didn't understand at all.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, can you have the Witness clarify the point?
MR. TOWNSEND:
It would be my pleasure, Your Honours. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Can you explain what happened -- I'm not sure if I got the point, but I'll try.  You said that several persons fell from the grenade and others retreated.  Can you clarify or expand on that briefly?
A.	Thank you.  I was saying that they followed us.  They were stronger than us because they were throwing grenades at us, and the gendarmes and policemen were shooting at us.  So we fled towards the inside of the church.  We were throwing stones through windows and the windows were breaking.  Grenades were thrown inside the church, into the church, and at a certain point in the evening -- in the meantime, however, more than a thousand people had been killed.  Corpses were lying in front of the secretariat of the church.  And at that point, I saw, once again, people who were in the inner courtyard of the presbytery.  I saw gendarmes shooting at those people.  The major seminarian called Appolinnaire Hakizimana was shooting with a bow and arrow.  Father Seromba, who was standing on the upper floor and -- and was congratulating the Interhamwe.  Father Seromba was throwing down bottles of beer to them.  That was at the presbytery, and he was throwing bottles of beer to them as congratulations and was telling them that they should quench their thirst.  Towards the evening, Father Seromba came to the secretariat, and I saw him join the leaders of the Interhamwe, the gendarmes.  And then I saw Father Seromba said that they should bring a mechanical shovel with which to remove the corpses lest visitors come to the church and find the corpses in front of the church.  One other thing --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, can you be a bit slower.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The President is asking the Witness to be a bit slower.
THE WITNESS: 
One other thing, what was done on that same day after the death of those people who were killed on that Friday, Father Athanase Seromba, after having called in a bulldozer and the bulldozer was removing the corpses from the courtyard, Father Seromba gave jobs to some female Interhamwe to clean up the -- to clean up the blood that had splashed on the floor and in the walls as well as in the -- the walls of the secretariat of the presbytery.  During the night, the Interhamwe were still there.  We therefore spent the night inside the church. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness CBJ, to which ethnic group did those attackers belong?
A.	They belonged to the Hutu ethnic group.
Q.	Did you notice if some of the attackers wore any distinctive clothing or not?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What did you see them wear?
A.	They were wearing banana leaves, bush-dried and fresh banana leaves, and in what we call our area, mitanga.  They were also wearing or bearing marks. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness had just said the word in Kinyarwanda, and the interpreter was asking him to explain the word, and he was saying that it was some kind of mud which looks like paint and which can even give one the impression of being white, even though he is black.  Those are explanations that were gotten from the Kinyarwanda booth.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, can you clarify what you were saying -- what he was saying concerning the mud, because we didn't get the entire answer.
THE WITNESS:
They covered their faces with that mud, and they did this in order not to be identified.  It was one way of concealing their identities.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Can you estimate the highest number of Tutsis gathered there to seek refuge on the 16th of April '94?
A.	I was with them.  I can estimate their number to have reached between 2,000 and 3,000.
Q.	Earlier you mentioned bourgmestre Grégoire Ndahimana.  Did you see him during the attack?
A.	I saw him.
Q.	Please tell us briefly what you saw.
A.	Gregoire Ndahimana, at the time the Interhamwe were killing people, Ndahimana was shooting at the refugees.  He shot at us, together with the policemen and gendarmes. 
Q.	Earlier you mentioned seeing Seromba passing beer bottles.  Can you tell us where that took place?
MR. POGNON:
Objection.  The witness never said -- the witness never said that Seromba was passing with crates of beer.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If I heard well, I think he was saying that Seromba was sending bottles of beer to the Interhamwe so that they can quench their thirst with, but he never mentioned crates.  And the idea was to congratulate them.
MR. MONTHÉ:
I think he said both.  He said both, drink the beer and give them the beer to congratulate them and they can quench their thirst with.
MR. TOWNSEND:
I see co-counsel has overruled lead counsel's objection.  I will rephrase in an open way. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	What did you see happen with beer?
MR. POGNON:
There is no mention of crates of beer.
MR. TOWNSEND:
I said beer, not crates of beer.  (No interpretation)
THE WITNESS:
From the question that was put to me, in that regard, I did not mention crates of beer.  The Prosecutor did not ask me the question concerning crates.  I saw him take a crate of Primus beer and he was holding the bottles that he was throwing to the Interhamwe and we were being shot at at that time.  In any case, I did not quite follow the incident.  I saw him giving beer to Interhamwe and I was an eyewitness to this. 

MR. POGNON:
Madam President, there is a problem.  Either it is translator who insists on saying crates of beer, or it is the witness who, having said he didn't talk about crates of beer to the Prosecutor, just said that he saw him take a crate of beer.  I think the issue should be ironed out.  If the Prosecutor wants it to be crates of beer, let him just say so.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, can you clarify the point for us?  You just talked about a crate now, or did you talk of something else concerning the beer? 
THE WITNESS:
I did not talk about crates.  I did say that I saw him distributing beer, and it was Primus beer.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	When you say he gave beer, to whom are you referring?
A.	He was throwing bottles to the Interhamwe who was below the building, and those same Interhamwe were killing us. 
Q.	The Interhamwe received the beer from whom?  Can you say the name?
A.	From Father Athanase Seromba.
Q.	Do you recollect someone on the 15th of April named Miriam?
MR. POGNON:
Objection.  Objection.  The question, in itself, carries the answer because, so far, this is the first time we're hearing that name, and the Prosecutor brings up the name and is asking him if he -- the name rings a bell.  Of course he will answer yes.  So the question, in itself, bears with it the answer, and this is not normal.
MR. TOWNSEND:
The question may be responded in the negative, and, as such, is not necessarily leading.  Also, he's talking about a thousand victims, Your Honour.  If we're to make any progress, that question has to be allowed.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very good.  You may carry on.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Do you know someone called Miriam, yes or no?
A.	I know that person.
Q.	Did you see her on the 15th of April, yes or no?
A.	I did not quite get the date.
Q.	Did you see her at the Nyange church between the 10th and 16th of April 1994?
A.	Yes.
MR. MONTHÉ:
That is the same question.  The first question: did you see him on the 15th of April?  Now it is between the 10th and the 16th, so it's no longer the same question.  I think he should tell us.
MR. TOWNSEND:
I'm not sure if I heard a legal objection.  I'll carry on.  Was there an answer to that, Your Honours?  I'll repeat it. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Did you see Miriam when you were at Nyange church during your stay from the 10th to the 16th of April?
A.	Yes, I saw her.
Q.	Did anything happen to her?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you briefly explain?
A.	Yes.  Miriam was the wife of Jean Kariyanga, who was a businessman.  At the beginning, when people started fleeing and taking refuge at the church, she took refuge in the church after the death of Habyarimana.  But on the 14th -- or before the 14th of April 1994, Father Seromba -- the girls from Miriam's family and the people who were educated, in particular the teachers -- so Father Seromba had given to these people lodgings, accommodation at the presbytery.  But on the 14th, when they held the meeting, the purpose of which was to decide on our being killed, he sent away these people to whom he had provided accommodation.  So Miriam and her family joined us in the church.  I was together with Miriam and her family in the church.  And on the 15th, the doors were opened for us and we came out.  And after having gotten outside, during the attacks, Miriam went to the same building in which she was before, and Father Seromba, once again, sent her -- sent away the people who were in the rear court to the presbytery, and where these people were coming out, they were being shot at.  Miriam was captured after she had been sent away by Father Seromba.  She was beaten up in front of the secretariat, and I saw people bring her to the front of the church.  I didn't quite observe the scene, but subsequently I saw her mortal remains, that is the mortal remains of Miriam.  Her clothes had been stripped off.  She was treated very shabbily, and that is what I can say that I saw about Miriam. 
Q.	Did you see her clothes being removed?
A.	Yes, I was an eyewitness.  Her body was dragged on the ground.
Q.	Did you recognise anyone present or perpetrating that against her?
A.	Amongst those who were humiliating Miriam -- Mr. Prosecutor, is that the person that you want me to say if I saw any of those that were humiliating Miriam?
Q.	Yes, and if you did, please state those names. 
A.	Those I were able to identify, Kayishema -- Kayishema Fulgence, of the judicial police.  Miriam was dragged by a certain Murindanyi, but I do not know his first name.  The judicial police inspector,Kayishema, was holding Miriam's head and was banging it against the floor of the courtyard.  I saw them undress her and her legs were spread apart.  That was what I was able to see. 
Q.	You said that Seromba sent some people out.  Can you estimate the number of people sent out?
A.	If I can make an estimate of the number of people who were sent out, on Friday, I could say that those who were sent out on Friday were many more.  They were much more of them. 
Q.	And to which ethnic group were those persons that were sent out?
A.	Those people belonged to the Tutsi ethnic group.
Q.	And those others besides Miriam, what happened to them?
A.	Those other people -- I can give you the case of a teacher called Anicet Gatare.  On the 15th, after the killings had begun, I saw Father Seromba.  On the upper floor, certain people were climbing walls, and they were coming from the church and were going to take refuge at the presbytery.  And I saw Father Seromba stretch his hands, his arms, towards the gendarmes, who were close by.  He was complaining and was saying, "Where are these people going, these people who are climbing the walls?"  And all of a sudden, I saw the gendarmes in front of the corridor close to the ground floor.  I saw them shoot at Anicet Gatare.  And the major seminarian, who was in the company of Father Athanase Seromba, was shooting at people with a bow and arrow. 
Q.	Witness CBJ, in relationship to the occurrence of the attack on 15th April 1994, when did Seromba send out Miriam and those others?
A.	It was between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m.  There's a point I haven't quite qualified.  Miriam and the other people who were with her were on the first floor.  That is where the priests had given them lodgings. 
Q.	What was the job of Anicet Gatare?
A.	He was a teacher.
Q.	To which ethnic group did he belong?
A.	He was Tutsi.
Q.	Where on his person was Anicet Gatare shot?
A.	He was shot in the chest.
Q.	You've mentioned something earlier about cleaning up blood.  Can you say who said those words and give us the exact words, if possible?
A.	It was Father Athanase Seromba.
Q.	You mentioned a female to whom he said those words.  Can you give us her name?
A.	We were not only dealing with one woman.  There were many of them, but the one I could identify was a girl called Mujawamaria, Épiphane.  Regarding Épiphane Mujawamaria , Father Seromba compensated her or rewarded her by staying with her.  He fled in the company of that girl, and he held the bravery of that girl, saying that girl was far-sighted. 
Q.	Did she have a nickname, yes or no?
A.	She was nicknamed Nirimazu.
Q.	What blood was being referred to or cleaned up?
A.	It was the blood of Tutsis who had been killed in the parish.
Q.	You mentioned a bulldozer or mechanical shovel.  What did you see it do on Friday, the 15th of April?
A.	I saw the bulldozer.
Q.	Did you see it on the 15th of April, Friday, 1994?
A.	Yes, but it wasn't only one bulldozer.  There were two bulldozers.
Q.	What did you see happen with regard to the bulldozers?
A.	One of the bulldozers was picking up bodies.  First of all, those bulldozers were used to dig a ditch.  One of the bulldozers brought the bodies and threw them into three different mass graves.  Another that had tooth shovels brought the corpses round and grenades were being thrown. 
Q.	You mentioned three graves.  Can you tell us the locations of the three?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Please do.
A.	The first mass grave was dug in the priests' banana plantation where we had gone to harvest bananas.  The place was called Rugabano on the road leading to Kibuye.  The other mass grave was dug behind the building used by CARITAS and which was in the centre of Nyange.  The other mass grave was dug at the place where the firm called Astaldi had kept its machines.  And that firm was in charge of constructing roads in Gitarama. 
Q.	In what year did you see the grave or pit at Astaldi?
A.	It is at a place called Vungu, in Vungu in Nyange secteur.
Q.	In what year did you see the pit at Astaldi at Vungu ?
A.	It was in 1995, when we were exhuming the remains of our people who had been thrown inside those mass graves. 
Q.	Do you know a Boniface Gatare?
A.	I know Boniface Gatare.
Q.	What is his job?
A.	He is no longer alive.  He is dead.
Q.	What was his ethnicity?
A.	He was Tutsi.
Q.	Before his death, what was his job?
A.	He was a youth animator in Kivumu commune.
Q.	What happened to Boniface Gatare?
A.	On the 15th of April 1994, at about 7 p.m., afterwards they had hidden behind the rear courtyard of the presbytery, and at night I heard Father Athanase Seromba calling out to the night watchman called Canisius Habiyambere.  And he told him to search every where in the rear courtyard of the presbytery to see if there weren't any Tutsis hiding there.  All of a sudden, I saw Canisius was standing behind up in the presbytery, and shortly thereafter, Father Seromba came down accompanied by Father Edward Nturiye and Father Emmanuel Kayiranga, and major seminarian, Appollinaire Hakizumana.  I saw them run and pass near the kitchen door.  They were running.  They bought back Gatare, Boniface.  It was dark there in the kitchen.  I could identify them when they got very close to the water tank; they were carrying torches.  He left the presbytery crying in pain, "Why do you want to kill me?"  So they passed near the secretariat in the church.  I don't know where they killed him.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Your Honours, that's all the questions I have on the 15th of April.  I'm going to be turning now to the 16th and start a new line of questions.  I'm not sure if this is a good moment to take a break or if you'd like me to carry on.  I'm in your hands.  I'm happy to keep going.  I'm not sure what time you're normally taking your break, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Usually we take a break at 4 p.m.  You may continue, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
I thank you very much, Your Honours. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness CBJ, I'd like you to turn your attention now to Saturday, 16th of April 1994.  What did you see happen first on that day?
A.	On Saturday, the 16th of April 1994, on the night of the 15th, the Interhamwe did not achieve the objective of exterminating us.  They kept us all night.  They lit a fire outside and they surrounded Nyange church.  The next day in the morning, on the 16th of April 1994, I again saw the leaders of the Interhamwe arrive.  They walked up to Father Athanase Seromba.  They spoke with one another for a short while.  The conversation lasted less than 30 minutes.  Afterwards, they came down and they went to the Codekoki operative building.  

When they came back from that place, Bourgmestre Grégoire Ndahimana came carrying a firearm called SMJ.  There were attackers all around that area, but there weren't very many of them.  And all around, there was someone talking into a megaphone.  People were blowing horns and whistles, and on all the hills, it was said that -- this was on the 15th and the 16th, so people were saying come and help Kanyarukiga in the church.  At that time, Fulgence Kanyarukiga and Rushema Anastase came, as well as the deputy bourgmestre called Rupenda.  He had his own name.  I had saw Judge Habyiambere.  He was a canon court judge.  There were other people, one person called Telésphore Ndugutse; Gashug François, a businessman.  I saw them arrive in the courtyard, and they started talking in loud tones so that those of us inside the church could hear, and he was trying to raise our morale, saying that calm had been restored, that a communiqué had been read over the radio, a communiqué from the presidency, stating that we shouldn't continue killing and that survivors should not be killed because they had killed enough.  

But it was only a trick on their part.  It was a trick on the part of those officials and Father Seromba.  These officials and Father Seromba went around telling the various assailants and saying we who are inside the church should also hear what you are saying because we are trying to defend ourselves using bricks.  

Now then, we focus on the day of the 16th.  That was when they started telling us that there was pacification, that calm had returned, and after 10:00, the gendarmes again opened fire.  Whenever there was an attack, the opening signal was that gendarmes fired into the air.  We had thought that the gendarmes had come to protect us, but as a matter of fact, the gendarmes were acting in league with Athanase Seromba because they were working in close cooperation with one another.  At that time the assailants came.  They threw stones and tried to break the doors.  Grenades were thrown, firearms were used, and subsequently they tried to bring dynamite.  I don't know what you know what we're referring to.  Normally, dynamite is used to break rocks.  So they used all those weapons on the 16th.  Therefore, many people were killed.  But at about 3 p.m., they hadn't exterminated everyone.
Q.	If I can stop you there.  Going back to the meeting you observed at Codekoki, can you tell us the names of the persons you saw going to that meeting?
A.	As regards to that meeting, it had brought together many people, and one of those people was Father Athanase Seromba.  There was also Gaspard Kanyarukiga, businessman.  There was also the judicial police inspector, Fulgence Kayishema; the teacher, Telésphore Ndungutse; the judge, Habiyambere; alias Kutskabutelezi; a businessman, François Gashug, and many others who were working with those people I have just named. 
Q.	Was anyone else present around the Codekoki area when they exited that meeting?
A.	There were people there.  These were the assailants who were standing close by, waiting for the sign to be given so that they should go and kill us. 
Q.	Are you able to give us an estimate of how many assailants you saw there gathered then?
A.	I have not quite understood the question.  Are you referring to the officials or simply the assailants?  I do not know exactly the purpose of your question. 
Q.	I'm referring to the assailants you referred to as waiting for instructions, or words to that effect.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, we are listening to you.
THE WITNESS:
I have a problem.  Before I came into the courtroom, I talked to the Prosecutor regarding the wound I had which I sustained as a result of the Interhamwe.  My head is heated up, and I'm feeling confused.  This is the situation I am facing now.  I don't think I can understand the questions that are put to me now.  Perhaps to give you an idea of the problem I am having, if someone were -- if one of you were to come over to me and touch my head, you'd understand the problem I am referring to and which I am facing.

	1530H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  To enable the witness to rest a little, we will take the break now and the break will last 15 minutes.  

These proceedings are adjourned. 
(Court recessed from 1532H to 1550H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We've resumed proceedings. 

Mr. Prosecutor, you have the floor.  

Mr. Witness, are you feeling any better now?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Madam President. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you, Your Honours. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you estimate the number of assailants gathered outside during the Codekoki building that day, 16 April 1994?
A.	The persons who launched the attack against us were more than 50,000 in number.
Q.	You said that someone addressed the refugees and stated that calm had been restored or words to that effect.  Who said that?
A.	The person who made those statements was the bourgmestre, Grégoire Ndahimana, but he was assisted in that by Father Seromba and the other persons that I mentioned; that is, the leaders of the Interahamwe.  But the first person to make those statements was the bourgmestre, Grégoire Ndahimana.  As for the others, they broke up into groups and went and repeated the statements elsewhere.  In doing so, those of us who were inside the building were also hearing the words that were being spoken.
Q.	Did --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, can you ask the witness if, indeed, there were 50,000 people?  Probably, that was a question you wanted to ask. 

Mr. Witness, did you actually mention 50,000 people when you were talking about those who were in front of the Codekoki corporative building.

THE WITNESS:
Yes, I talked about 50,000.  If I had to refer to the assailants that were in the vicinity of the Codekoki, and if you add to that, the other people who were in the neighbourhood of the church who came to attack us.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Did Ndahimana carry anything in his hands at that time?
A.	I think I've already said this.  Ndahimana was armed with a Kalashnikov gun.
Q.	You mentioned words to the effect being broadcast on a megaphone, words of "The population should come and help Kanyarukiga", or words to that effect.  What did you understand that to mean?
A.	To begin with, I'd like to inform you that the said person, Gaspard Kanyarukiga was the leader of all the Interahamwe of the Kivumu commune, and this means that even people like Father Seromba, Athanase, were under his orders.  I will, therefore, continue by saying that the loud speaker and the other calls that were met with the populations on the hills were intended to call all the Hutus from all the hills to come and bring assistance to Kanyarukiga in church.  In fact, it was being said that Kanyarukiga was not in a good position compared to the Inyenzis that were in the church, so the calls were made to call those people to come and help exterminate the Tutsis who had taken refuge in the Nyange parish.
Q.	During the attacks by the assailants, did you see Seromba?
A.	I did not quite understand your question.  I don't know if you are asking me if I saw him in the attacks.  I don't quite understand your question.
Q.	CBJ, you mentioned that after some shots an attack was launched.  Did you see Seromba at any point during that attack; yes or no?
A.	During that attack, Father Seromba, Athanase, did not take part in the attack.  On the contrary, during that period, each time that the attacks were going on, he was on a high or elevated area and was watching, but from time to time he used to come down and talk with the assailants.
Q.	What we got was a high place.  Can you give us a name of that place where you saw Seromba?
A.	There is a storey building.  Generally, we talk about a storey building.  First of all, there is a ground floor and a first floor, an upper floor, and it is that upper floor that the priests sleep.  And often it is at that upper floor that he used to stand and observe what was happening. 
Q.	Did you see a bulldozer on that day, the 16th of April?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you estimate the time that elapsed from the start of the attack until you saw the bulldozer moving?
A.	The attack began after ten o'clock.  And at about 3 p.m. the bulldozer -- in fact, that is when the bulldozers arrived.  They arrived on the previous day.  And on the day that they arrived, they were parked opposite the road leading to Kibuye, that is, on the left side of the church of the Nyange church, that is, talking about where the bulldozers were parked.
Q.	While you saw the bulldozers move on the 16th of April, did you see Seromba; yes or no?
A.	I saw him.
Q.	Where?
A.	I saw him in front of the secretariat office of the priests.
Q.	Did you see him talking to anyone at that time and at that location?
A.	Yes.
Q.	With whom was Seromba speaking, or who else did you see present there?
A.	At that time, they held discussions close to the church.  I saw many Interahamwe including the driver called Anastase.  I saw those people go into the presbytery courtyard and they came out of it.  At that time, in front of the secretariat office, was -- Father Seromba was standing on the threshold of the door and he spoke to him saying, "Really, father, do you accept that I should destroy this church?"  I saw Father Athanase Seromba nod.  The driver spoke to him again, to Father Seromba.  And then for a third time, "Father, do you accept that I should destroy this church", and Father Seromba answered in these words, "Unless you, yourselves, are Inyensi, destroy it.  All we want is to get rid of the Inyenzi.  As for the rest of it, we the Hutus are many.  If we get rid of the Inyenzi, we will build another church.  We will build a new church."  
Q.	When you say driver Anastase, he was the driver of which vehicle?
A.	He was working in the Astaldi construction sites and he was the one who drove those tractors or bulldozers.  I would also add that when he spoke to Father Seromba in those words, I notice that that driver was afraid.
Q.	Did you see anything happen immediately after Seromba said those words?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Please explain what you saw happen at that location then.
A.	After he had uttered the words I have just cited, and I was referring to Father Seromba, Athanase, who spoke to the driver, I saw Father Seromba touch his pockets, and he once more -- that is, he dipped into his pocket and gave something -- put something in the driver's hands.  The driver smiled, Kayishema did the same.  He did it as if he was giving something to the driver.  The driver withdrew and started destroying the church.
Q.	After something was given to the driver, where did he specifically walk?
A.	The driver turned to the left-hand side of the church above -- on the road leading to Kibuye.  He started demolishing the left-hand side of the church, that is, left-hand side of the building.
Q.	Where was the bulldozer at the time of that conversation you've just explained?
A.	The bulldozer was parked on the left-hand side opposite the church.
Q.	When you say "left-hand side", can you specify whether it was towards the front or towards the rear of the left-hand side of the church?
A.	I have given you an example on this subject.  When you leave Nyange centre and you go up towards the main entrance of the church, when you are opposite the church, you look to the left above the road leading to Kibuye.
Q.	Was the bulldozer on the left-hand side closer to the doors -- the front doors of the church or closer to the back altar side of the church?
A.	He was on the side where the altar of the church is found.
Q.	Can you explain what you saw when you saw the bulldozer hit the church?
A.	It started by demolishing the left side which I made mention of.  There was still people alive inside the church, and gradually the church collapsed on those people.  He again tackled the other wall of the church on the side of the presbytery.  He again tackled the side, the wall on the side of the altar.
Q.	What was the last part of the church to remain standing?
A.	The answer I would give to this question poses a problem because from the answer I will give, my identity could somehow be revealed.  If you would allow me, I would request that we have another framework during which I could give the answer to this question.
Q.	Thank you.  Can you estimate how long it took to destroy Nyange church on 16 April 1994?
A.	The operation which consisted in destroying the church lasted, roughly, three hours.
Q.	Can you estimate the number of persons that died in the destruction of the church and the attack on it on 16 April 1994?
A.	The people who died in that place on the 16th of April can be estimated at over 1,500 people.
Q.	What were the ages of the people that were killed there and then?
A.	Those who perished in that place were composed of men, women, young boys and girls, there were children and even babies.  There were babies who were being carried by their mothers.
MR. TOWNSEND:
At this time, Your Honours, I'd move for a closed session as I seek to ask a question which will elicit answers which may identify the identity of this protected witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objection from the Defence?
MR. MONTHÉ:
No objection, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Counsel Monthé. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 18 to 29] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 14 to 17 by Roxane Lane)






1720H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, we are now in open session.  

Counsel for the Prosecution, you may proceed with the examination-in-chief.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you, Your Honours.  
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness CBJ, did Seromba or any church authority give you aid or assistance while you were seeking refuge at Nyange church?
A.	No assistance was given us.  If assistance had been given us, we would not have had to go to the banana plantation to harvest bananas, which brought us into conflict with the priests. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
For the interpreters, I am at question 129.  
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness CBJ, did Seromba give food to the refugees, yes or no?
A.	No.
Q.	Were there sick and injured among the Tutsi refugees at Nyange church?
A.	Yes, there were some.
Q.	Was medical attention provided to them?
A.	No.
Q.	What distance is the closest clinic to Nyange church?
A.	Between the hospital and the parish is a distance of two kilometres, about two kilometres.
Q.	Were the sick and injured allowed to go to the clinic?
A.	In answer to this question, I will say that I did not see anyone go to the hospital, but after the war I gathered some information -- some information on that subject.
Q.	While you were at the Nyange parish area, did you feel free to leave?
A.	It was not possible.
Q.	Why?
A.	I stated to you right at the beginning that when we left our homes we were attacked on the hills and killed.  When we got to the church no one could go any further than 30 metres from the church.  No one could leave the parish because the Interahamwe were killing people.
Q.	Do you know if Seromba took any action to stop those responsible for crimes committed at Nyange parish?
A.	Father Seromba did not say anything to come to our assistance and to reassure us since the time we arrived in Nyange, and the proof of this is that the church was destroyed while we were inside.  No door of the presbytery was smashed in.  None of the houses in the presbytery were destroyed.  This is evidence that he was cooperating with the Interahamwe.
Q.	Did Seromba take action to report or punish those responsible for crimes at Nyange parish?
A.	How could he have done that, whereas his intention was to exterminate them -- to exterminate us?  If someone showed you a scar sustained from an injury from a wound, if he tried to help us -- he couldn't have tried to help us; he was an Interahamwe.  All he did was to give reports on the number of people who were there so that we should be attacked.  He gave jobs to the Interahamwe.  He cooperated with them.  He baptised the children of Interahamwe, whereas they had committed killings, and he fled with them.  That is all he did.  What he did was to exterminate us.  He cannot show -- he cannot show any wound he, himself, sustained in trying to defend us.
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
Nothing further.
THE WITNESS:
I also thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you.  We now turn to the Defence.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, Madam President.  This is the Defence's answer.  Yesterday I made a hullabaloo.  We saw -- and the difficulties we encountered when the senior officials arrived.  We understood that cross-examination would not take place immediately following the intervention of the Prosecution.  I would propose that we resume cross-examination tomorrow in order to do what we have not been able to do because of the manoeuvres of the Prosecution.
MR. TOWNSEND:
I'm ready to proceed in direct with CBN.  It will take about an hour.
MR. MONTHÉ:
All you have to do is to tell us to leave the courtroom so that you can conduct the proceedings alone.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, we are trying to see whether we can meet all day tomorrow but, apparently, it is not possible.

We are going to adjourn now and try to give you more precise information because we, apparently, do not know whether we can sit all day tomorrow.  If it is possible, we will let you know in about 15 minutes because by then we should have some information.  But it would appear that it is possible for us to meet all day on Thursday, and it will also be possible for us to sit on Friday morning.  There we are.

The proceedings stand adjourned and information will be provided to you as soon as possible.

Good evening to you all.
(Court adjourned at 1734H)
