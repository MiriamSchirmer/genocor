MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is called to order, ladies and gentlemen.  We will continue this morning with the cross-examination of Witness FE27.

Prosecutor, can you proceed with the cross-examination of the witness?

I believe we were in closed session yesterday.
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR:
My apologies, Madam President.  Madam President, I have a problem with my voice, but I will try my best. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Sorry, I can't hear you at all, Prosecutor.  Just hold on a minute.

You can now proceed, Prosecutor.
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR:
Thank you, Madam President.
WITNESS FE27,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.
A.	Good morning, Prosecutor.
Q.	Witness, when the president of Rwanda was killed --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, could you speak slightly more loud than that?  We also want to hear you.  It would appear, Prosecutor, you have a problem.  It's difficult to speak louder?  We will try to follow you.  Let me just tell you that yesterday we were in closed session.  Now, if the questions you want to put to the witness this morning could be in open session; otherwise, we can go back to the closed session.
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR:
Madam President, I think we can start in open session and then we will revert maybe after half an hour to closed session.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, then.  We are in open session.  You can put your questions to the witness.
BY MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR:
Q.	Yes, Witness, when the president of Rwanda was killed, people in your commune said that the president was killed by Tutsis, correct, Witness?
A.	Yes, after the president was murdered most of the population did not know who killed him, but as time went by it was said that he was killed by the Tutsis, and virtually the majority of the population were saying that the president was killed by the Tutsis.
Q.	And, of course, Witness, this would have generated hatred for the Tutsi by Hutus in your area?
A.	Yes, during that period after the president died.
Q.	Witness, before I ask you the next question, let me remind you that we are in open session.  You will -- according to your evidence, you were on your way to work -- do not mention where you worked -- you were on your way to work.  You were told that the president had died, and you went home and you said that some people came to see you.  What date did these people come to see you?  Was it on the 7th or on the days thereafter?
A.	It was on the 7th.
Q.	And these people who came to see you, Witness, what did they come to see you about?
A.	Those were my neighbours who were moving around in the village to secure or obtain some information with respect -- or, in connection with the death of the president.
Q.	So, Witness, you were in your commune in April 1994.  You were someone that other people came to for direction and for information, correct, Witness?
A.	Yes.
Q.	When you saw Ndungutse addressing many people at the business centre, was he talking to Hutu men?
A.	He was talking to the Hutus, but there were Tutsis.  I believe I saw two Tutsis who were there.
Q.	And this Ndungutse, he was saying that the president had been killed by the Tutsis.  Is that so, Witness?
A.	Yes, that's what he was saying.  He was talking to members of the population who had come for a beer - or, for a drink at the business centre.
Q.	He was also talking, according to you, Witness, about going to attack the Ndakubana family, correct?
A.	Yes, that's what he said.
Q.	And in your professional capacity -- we are in open session, Witness.  In your professional capacity, you did not report what you had heard about the attack that was planned on this family; isn't that so, Witness?
A.	There was no report for me to take -- or, submit to anyone whatsoever.  It was in a period of war, and I promptly went back home.
Q.	Witness, this family, the Ndakubana family, they were Tutsis, were they not?
A.	Yes, they were Tutsi, neighbours to Ndungutse.
Q.	And they were not participants in any war; they were not soldiers of any kind.  Isn't that so, Witness?
A.	That's right, just his neighbours.
Q.	So you would agree with me that the attack on the Ndakubana family had nothing to do with war, wouldn't you, Witness?
A.	In actual fact, the war had not yet reached our location.
Q.	So, you didn't think, Witness, that these civilians who were being attacked when the war had not even reached you, you did not think it fit that you should report this?
A.	Well, that information got to me quite late.  It was around four o'clock in the afternoon, and they embarked on the operation at night.  We couldn't move because it was being said that there was a radio announcement that there had to be a curfew.
Q.	Since -- well, what time did you leave that business centre to go to your home, Witness?
A.	I got there about 4 p.m. and I left the place at 5 p.m.
Q.	Yet, you seem to be very knowledgeable, Witness, about the fact that the family was attacked at night.  How, Witness, did you come to this --
A.	It was just -- he was making those statements.  He wasn't that sure about going to attack that family.  He was saying it might just be possible that an attack be carried out against that family.
Q.	And this time you spent at the business centre, it happened on the 8th of April 1994, isn't that so, Witness?
A.	That's correct, yes.
Q.	So, yesterday, when you said that you remained home from the 7th to the 11th of April throughout, that was not the truth; isn't that so, Witness?
A.	That is the truth.  I remembered that I walked some two kilometres beyond my house, for a drink.  So, when I was saying so yesterday, it just meant that I didn't leave my home to go to my place of work.
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR:
Madam President, if I may be given a moment.

Madam President, I think now I am forced to go into closed session.  I have been trying to go around it, but I must now apply for a closed session to protect the identity of this witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Does the Defence have any objections to raise to Madam Prosecutor's question?
MR. NEKUIE:
No objections, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We shall go into closed session now in order to protect the identity of the witness and in the interest of justice.  Sorry for all those in the public gallery.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 4 to 32] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 1 to 3 by Verna Butler)




MADAM PRESIDENT:
	Fine.  We are now in open session, and I am going to hand down the two rulings that were taken by the Trial Chamber.  

The Trial Chamber taken by a motion by the Defence with a view to authorising -- to obtaining authorisation in order to review the list of witnesses, Defence witnesses, that is.  Unfortunately, I only have one copy of the document.  So I will speak more slowly.  I will start again.  

The Trial Chamber, seized by a motion on the part of the Defence entitled,"Motion from the Defence for the authorisation of reviewing the list of Defence witnesses", filed with the registry on the 7th of March 2006.   In view -- or, considering the response on the part of the Prosecution to the said motion filed or response provided on the 10th of March 2006, considering the additional brief provided by the Defence, entitled "Brief in response to - or, response given on the 12th of March 2006", rules as follows:  

On the basis of the brief filed by the parties in compliance with the provision of Article 73(A) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, the Trial Chamber, after deliberation, grants the Defence motion to revise the list of witnesses and grants the leave to withdraw witnesses FE27 and FE25 from the initial -- FE25 from the initial list of Defence witnesses, and allows the additional inclusion of witnesses PS1 and PS2 on the said list; orders for the witnesses PS1 and PS2 to be provided with protection as Defence witnesses, such as stipulated in the decision of 31st of January 2005, and informs the parties that a written decision will follow this oral decision.  

The second ruling:  

The Trial Chamber seized with an -- of an oral motion on the part of the Prosecution to have the Chamber order a visit of the sites in Rwanda, presenting in session on the 23rd of March 2006. Considering the response -- or positive response on the part of the Defence, considering Article 4 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, relevant to a session held outside of the Tribunal, in view of the interest of justice, rules as follows:  

Pursuant to Article 73 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, the Trial Chamber after deliberation, grants the Prosecution -- the Prosecution's motion and orders for there to be a visit to the site in Rwanda for a date that will be indicated to the parties at a later date, and invite the parties to submit to the Trial Chamber a list of the sites to be visited and ask for -- and ask the President of the Tribunal to grant authorisation to the Trial Chamber and to the parties to go to Rwanda in order to conduct these site -- or on-site visits and orders the registry to take all necessary -- make all necessary arrangements for this decision to be fulfilled.  

	Thank you.  So those are the two rulings to be handed down.  I think it is too late now for us to start with a new witness.  

Mr. Prosecutor, do you want to take the floor?  
MR. MOSES: 
	Just in relation to the second order that Your Honour has made, perhaps in one of the fastest compliances with a Trial Chamber order, I have a list -- proposed list signed by the Prosecution, copies for Your Honours, and one for the Defence of a list of places to be visited.  Your Honours will note at the bottom we've also ask or suggested that the Defence and Your Honours add to that list of other places that other party -- any party considers necessary to visit.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Maybe the Defence would like to add a detail. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
	Madam President, the Defence would simply like before we -- before leaving you in December, we had also included a report on the Witness FE36, I believe.  And, at that time, the report was to be produced within a reasonable time span.  Now, we have started our sittings again, and we don't know what happen to the report.  I believe it's important for the parties to know what's going on, because we are a little bit worried that nothing has happened about it.  Of course, the list of sites -- the Defence will, of course, add certain things to that list.  

	Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Monthé.  

Very well, we'll get back to you on the subject of that report, and we will wait for the Defence to give us the list of the sites that it would like to have the Trial Chamber and the various parties visit.  

As I said, we'll hear the next witness on Monday morning in view of the advanced hour.  Thank you to everybody, and have a nice weekend.  Court is adjourned.
