P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The session is called to order.  Ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry about the delay, but we had a series of unpleasant circumstances which made us become an hour late in our starting-off point.  I believe the Prosecutor would wish to take the floor before we make -- have the witness ushered in.  

Mr. Prosecutor, you have the floor.
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honours.  Two brief matters I want to raise.  The first has to do with disclosure.  I can confirm that, at about 7:30 on Wednesday evening, the Prosecutor received a list of names from the Defence for a number of their witnesses.  The list was not, however, complete, and there is one witness, witness number 25 on the list, with the pseudonym F for France, E for England, 25.  We received neither a statement, nor that person's name from the Defence.  It may be that that person no longer is to be a Defence witness.  If that is the case, then obviously we do not need any disclosure.  But at the moment, according to the witness order, the Defence witness order of appearance, that person is scheduled as witness 25 and we do not have the statement or name for that person. 

The second issue, which is also a brief issue, Your Honours, has to do with the forthcoming order of appearance from the witnesses.  The Defence has provided to Your Honours and ourselves the proposed witness order of appearance.  My friend made it clear to ourselves, and to Your Honours, that that was subject to WVSS providing and bringing those witnesses to testifying before the Tribunal.  At the moment we know who is going to be the witness following the present witness.  My understanding is that will be BZ1.  The list of order of appearance that we have been provided, the next three witnesses would be -- after BZ1, would be FE13, FE32, and CF4.  Because of the short notice in terms of being advised, those witnesses we are trying to prepare so that there will be no delay in terms of us carrying out our cross-examination. 

If, however, they are not the next witnesses to be called, and we are suddenly advised a day in advance that it is going to be witness 23 or 24, on who WVSS have brought, then that may be the cause of some delay.  So I'm really asking an indication from my friends whether WVSS have advised them who the next witnesses are so that we can prepare those ones, rather than spending time on witnesses who may be called later.  So those are the two issues that I wanted to raise with Your Honours at this time.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  

Mr. Monthé, can you give clarification, given what has been said by the Prosecution on those two issues, so we are dealing with witness number 25 and then your order of appearance. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, Madam President.  Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  I am reassured, because I thought that there were still problems, but now with regarding witness F25, this is a witness that can be called a character witness, same way as we had Mr. Materassi and Mr. Allessandro, whose surname escapes me, but we intend to have this witness appear because he is a man of good faith and he will say what he needs to say, so there will not be any statements regarding that person.  That's number one. 

Number two:  Regarding the second point, Madam President, Your Honours, we indicated to the Chamber that these are detainees, witnesses who are detained in Rwanda at the present moment and for whom we have initiated the procedure, the appropriate procedure, and the witness protection section has yet to indicate to us the fate reserved for our request with the government, Rwandan authorities. 

I can inform the Prosecution that the next Defence witness, which will be available, will be Y11.  Y11.  I believe we have been as exhaustive as possible.  I cannot say any more regarding the matters which have been raised, and I thank you, Madam President, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank Mr. Monthé.  

Mr. Prosecutor, do you want to add something?  Yes?  Please go ahead.
MR. MOSES:
So far as the first issue, namely, the identification of FE25, whilst there may be no statement that the Defence have in their possession regarding what that person is going to say, that does not, however, prevent them from giving the name and the details of that person to the Defence, which is part of Your Honour's order, that we are provided with that person's name.  If there is no statement, I take my friend's word at that, but that does not prevent them from providing the name and address of the person who is going to give character evidence, and we will need that in advance. 

So far as the translation of the following witness came through as Y11, that was the English translation of the witness pseudonym who was to be called next.  I don't know whether that is a correct interpretation, because I can see no Y11 on the list, but that was the English translation that came through. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  It is, indeed, YA1.  Maybe that was a mistake.  I did hear YA1 and he is number 22nd on your list?  

MR. MONTHÉ:
I, indeed, said YA1.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Furthermore, we also have Witness FE25 who is number 25 on your list.  Can you also indicate, please, the identity of this witness, if you don't have any statement for that person.  Yes, you are nodding, Counsel.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
I said a moment ago that, apart from the summaries that he is going to dwell on, there is no statement, so we have Mr. Farrugia, Allessandro, or Mr. Materassi.  We will do that witness as we did with the others and there is no difficulty.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So you will communicate or disclose the identity of Witness FE25 to the Prosecution; is that what you're saying?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Very well.  No problem, Madam President.  There's no problem. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Counsel, now, given what you have said, what about the order of the appearance of your witnesses?  The detainee witnesses are not here as yet.  Can you tell us who will be the next witnesses because you've spoken of YA1.  Will that be the next one after BZ1 and BZ2?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, what I understood, because Witness YA1 only arrived yesterday afternoon -- I think that's what I was told by the section, so it's not normal to have the witness appear immediately in Court.  So in my mind, and after the long discussions we've had, it was decided that BZ2 would be finished with and the Prosecution will begin with the cross-examination of witnesses already heard. 

This morning I had a meeting with the head of section of the witness section, and he was supposed -- she was supposed to tell me what was happening with the witnesses who I expected.  So I believe we are going to conclude with BZ2 and, given the commitments made by the Prosecution, I'm understanding that we're to move on to witnesses already heard with the cross-examination. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think, indeed, the Prosecution is going to begin with cross-examining the other witnesses, but that doesn't stop you from seeing what your order of appearance of your witnesses will be, and we want to know who will be appearing immediately after the cross-examination. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, Madam President.  As soon as Miss Bihegue is available, I will see her. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think everything is quite clear right now. 
Mr. Prosecutor, do you want to add anything?  
MR. MOSES:
Just so that I'm quite clear on what the order is, my understanding is that Witness BZ1 has yet to testify.  Oh, it was BZ8 who is no longer on the list.  Okay.  So the next witness may be YA1.  All right, thank you.  I'm clear now. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Can we ask the Defence to disclose to CMS documents which have been disclosed to the Prosecution?  This is for the case file. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, which documents are you referring to specifically?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This would be the list of witnesses that you have disclosed on Wednesday to the Prosecution.  In other words, information concerning those witnesses. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Very well, Madam President, we have taken note.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think we may now have the witness ushered in, Witness BZ2, so the examination in-chief of that witness may continue. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, Madam President, the Defence is ready. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Please usher in Witness BZ2, Registry. 

Mr. Prosecutor, I have a question.  Will you be able to cross-examine BZ2 immediately after his -- immediately after the examination in-chief?  
MR. MOSES:
Yes, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
(Witness entered courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Madam Witness BZ2.  When we left off on Wednesday, you were answering questions from the Defence.  I believe it was Mr. Monthé.  So, Mr. Monthé will continue with the examination-in-chief, and we remind you that you are still under oath and, after the examination-in-chief, you will be cross-examined by the Prosecution.  Thank you. 

Mr. Monthé, your witness. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President. 
WITNESS BZ2,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness BZ2.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	I hope you spent a good weekend and that you are ready to answer questions that I will put to you.  Are you ready, Madam?  
A.	I am ready, Counsel. 
Q.	Thank you.  When we adjourned on Wednesday afternoon, as far as I recall, we were dealing with one of the questions that I had put to you in reference to the members of the clergy, and I asked you whether you knew Father Jéan François Emmanuel Kayiranga, is that not so, Witness? 
A.	Yes, I know that priest.  That's correct. 
Q.	You said that you knew him well, and similarly, I asked you whether that priest had any relationship or any connection or involvement in the events that took place in Nyange, and you also responded in the negative, is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ2.  Now, after that brief reminder, Witness BZ2, I'm going to ask you my first question this afternoon.  Can you please tell this Chamber if you know of all these acts of violence that you saw, experienced or recalled, do you think that these acts of violence were previously planned by someone or by a group of persons? 
A.	As I heard, these acts of violence were not prepared or pre-planned. 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness BZ2, as far as I recall, I do not believe you answered my question as follows:   Why, according to you, did all these refugees, who were fleeing, went, rather, to the church and not elsewhere?  That's if you know.
A.	These refugees went to the church because they thought they were going to seek refuge with the clergy who normally would help them.  Even earlier when there had been a war, these refugees would go and seek refuge there.  So I was saying that these refugees went to the church because they believed that they would be safe there. 
Q.	Thank you.  This is only if you can answer.  Do you have an explanation why, this time around in 1994, the refugees did not find a safe haven in the Nyange church? 
A.	The way I see it, in the past these refugees had been saved because people were not furious because of the war.  But in 1994, when we looked at the Hutus, we realised that they were furious because of the actions carried out by the RPF, because of the behaviour of the RPF in the areas through which it passed, and this in regard to Hutus. 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness BZ2, there were many refugees who died at the parish and the Nyange church, and these were Tutsis.  Do you remember some names of the victims?  Please tell us if you remember any names and under what circumstances would those people have met their deaths in your opinion? 
A.	After the war I met people who had gone to the church and I would hear from time to time those people say or mention names, in particular, the name of a lady who was a friend of mine.  Her name was Miriam.  These people said that they had seen Miriam's body and the bodies of her children.  Mention was also made of the fact that a teacher named Gatare died at the church.  So those are the few names that I heard being mentioned by others who had gone to the church. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ2, for that clarification.  During those events and given this influx of refugees to the parish, can you tell us whether or not you saw or heard it said that roadblocks had been erected in your commune or in your neighbourhood? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  I learned that there had been roadblocks which had been erected, but I personally did not see them. 
Q.	Did you ever manage to know what was the purpose of those roadblocks or what was the intended purpose? 
A.	This was a period of war and these roadblocks were to be used in the control of movement of persons, and at given times combatants of the RPF would be intercepted in the flow of people who were being displaced. 
Q.	Thank you for that clarification.  What I want to ask you now is this:   If the attackers that you were able to see near or around the parish were armed in any particular manner, if you recall. 
A.	The assailant (sic) were often armed with traditional weapons, like clubs, spears and machetes. 
Q.	Witness BZ2, was it usual in Rwanda that people go out of their homes with these kinds of weapons in your opinion? 
A.	No, that was unusual. 
Q.	Still, if you know, were you able to have any explanation as to why these people were carrying these weapons and why they were going to the parish carrying those weapons?  Did the people in your neighbourhood speak about this event? 
A.	In any case, considering what we saw, they were going to fight.  That is why they were carrying these weapons. 
Q.	Since they were going to fight, do you think that those who had sought refuge at the parish also had weapons?  Did you know anything about that? 
A.	I don't know, but I learned that when they started fighting, the refugees defended themselves with the aid of rocks.  So they used rocks to resist the attacks of the assailants. 
Q.	Thank you, BZ2.  You indicated that you learned that these refugees were using rocks to defend themselves.  So from what you know, these people were not resigned to their fate; they fought to the bitter end, is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Thank you.  I do not think I understood your answer correctly, so I would like to ask you, in response to the question concerning the choice of the parish by the refugees, if I understand correctly, you said that in 1994 the Hutus were angry.  Why were they particularly angry in 1994, whereas they had not been so at other times.  Can you explain to us why they were upset? 
A.	I thought I explained this.  I told you that the Hutus became angry after the poor treatment that the RPF meted out to the Hutus in all regions through which the RPF passed. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did you observe this personally, Witness BZ2, or was this what was said around you? 
A.	These are things that were told to me.  Even on the radio it was said that RPF combatants had killed the Hutus that they had met in their path in a horrible manner. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ2.  BZ2, I'm going to ask you --
MR. MONTHÉ:
And Madam President, I don't know whether the registry kept the list that I had prepared for the witness and the Trial Chamber.  If the list is not ready, I shall provide another one. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry will show you the list and you will indicate whether this is the one that you are referring to. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, it is the list.  I would like to ask the Court that, regarding this list -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please proceed, Counsel. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
So, Madam President, four of the names on this list -- I can put questions about four of these names in open session.  For one of the other names, in view of the detailed responses that I expect, I shall request a closed session so that the identity of Witness BZ2 can be protected. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you think it would be dangerous to do what you did last week?  That is, in reference only to the names. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
I think that at least one of the names that is mentioned, that such is the case. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So you will start with the names that you can use in public -- in public -- in open session, and then we will move to closed session later.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
That is what I wanted to request of the Trial Chamber.  Thank you. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Now, Witness BZ2, now that you have the list of names before you, you will see that after every name there is a number.  So you have five numbers that go from 1 to 5.  I shall start with number 2 and I shall ask you whether you knew number 2.
A.	I can see names, but there is not a number at the end of every -- of these names.  I realised that number 1 should be a number 3.  Should I consider the names depending on their order, or depending on the numbers that you have indicated to me?  
Q.	No, you should consider the names based on the names that appear on the list and as I will call them out.  For those names that do not bear numbers, I will deal with them later.  It is because we wish to avoid any problems with the identity of the names that have been mentioned that we are going to use -- we are going to use the numbers.  Have you understood me, Witness BZ2? 
A.	Shall I look at the first name or the name that has number 1 next to it?
Q.	I do not know whether I am making myself understood.  You have before you a list of names.  Some of those names have numbers next to them:  1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  For the time being, that is what I'm interested in.  Do you understand me? 
A.	I have understood, Counsel. 
Q.	Thank you.  So I shall not call any names.  I shall use numbers.  So I am asking you, for instance, do you know number 2?  Then you answer "yes" or "no".  
A.	Yes, I have understood the procedure. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, are you ready to begin? 
A.	Yes, I am. 
Q.	Thank you.  So do you know number 2? 
A.	I know this person. 
Q.	Can you tell us the circumstances under which you came to know this person? 
A.	He was an office clerk in the commune. 
Q.	Thank you, BZ2.  Now, number 3; did you or do you know number 3? 
A.	Yes.  I knew this person well, as well. 
Q.	Did you meet this person during the events that are of concern to us in Nyange? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ2.  Now, I shall move on to number 4.  Do you know number 4? 
A.	No, I did not know this person. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did you know number 5? 
A.	I did not know the person indicated here as number 5 either. 
Q.	Thank you.  I am going to ask you the names of the people for which there is no numeric indication.  I shall set aside number 1 for the closed session.  Did you know Fulgence Kayishema? 
A.	Yes, I knew him. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court how you met Fulgence Kayishema? 
A.	He used to be a teacher.  After that he became a judicial police inspector for Kivumu commune. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did you see this gentleman during the events that we're discussing here? 
A.	I did not see him. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did you know someone called Gaspard Kanyarukiga? 
A.	Yes, I knew him also. 
Q.	Did you see him during the events? 
A.	I didn't see him either. 
Q.	Did you know Télesphore Ndungutse? 
A.	I know him, but at that time I didn't see him. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ2.  Can you tell us whether you knew Grégoire Ndahimana? 
A.	I know this man. 
Q.	Did you see him at the time of the events? 
A.	No, I never met him. 
Q.	Did you ever hear of Aloys Rwamasirabo? 
A.	I also know this person. 
Q.	Was this person present around Nyange parish in April 1994? 
A.	He lived near the parish.  He was a trader who owned a car. 
Q.	Were you told, at least for those of these people that you knew, were you told that any of these people were in contact with Father Seromba at any time? 
A.	No.  I heard no such thing. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ2.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, with the leave of the Court, I would like to move into closed session at this time so that I can put a series of questions to Witness BZ2. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right, Counsel.  Any objection, Mr. Prosecutor?  
MS. ALEXIS:
No, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.   We shall move into closed session in order to protect the identity of the witness and in the interests of justice.  We apologise to the public.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 10 to 17] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

(Court resumed at 1712H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The session is called to order.  
Madam Prosecutor, you have the floor for cross-examination of the Witness BZ2. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon.
Q.	Witness, in April of 1994, how many children did you have?  
A.	I had two children.
Q.	And was the age of the eldest child? 
A.	The eldest was born on the 27th of May 1991.
Q.	Very well, Witness.  You cannot assist this Court as to when Athanase Seromba came as a priest to Nyange parish; isn't that so? 
A.	Father Seromba came to the Nyange church towards the end of 1993.
Q.	Were you one of the persons who greeted him formally when he arrived, Witness? 
A.	He was introduced at church, and it was a church that I saw him for the first time. 
Q.	You very well, Witness.  You knew of course, Witness that there was another priest present at Nyange before Athanase Seromba, that is Father Straton; isn't that so? 
A.	Yes that's right.  
Q.	This Father Straton, he was a Tutsi; isn't it so? 
A.	I did not know whether he was Tutsis or Hutu. Priests were introduced to us, but we were not told whether they were Hutu or Tutsi.
Q.	So, if that is so, Witness, then would you know that Athanase Seromba is Hutu? 
A.	After the war, I came to know that Father Seromba is Hutu. 
Q.	Witness, before April 1994, did you hear that Father Straton and Athanase Seromba had a disagreement because father Straton had given food from CARITAS to some Tutsis; did you hear this? 
A.	I don't know anything about that. 
Q.	Witness, can you confirm that the first time you went to Nyange during the events of April 1994, was on the day that the church was being destroyed; is that what you said? 
A.	Can you please repeat your question?
Q.	My apologies, I will try to be clearer. I am merely trying to confirm.  Witness what you said in your evidence.  So this is my question:  Is it your evidence that in April 1994, the only day that you went to the church at Nyange was on the day it was being destroyed; is that your evidence? 
A.	I wasn't going to the church. I was on my own way going to the pharmacy, but since the pharmacy was near the church, I realised that there was some disorder at the church. I only went as far as Codekoki.
Q.	Therefore, Witness, would you agree with me that between the 7th of April 1994, and that day when you went to the Codekoki that you had never been near to the Court? 
A.	Between the 7th and day on which the church was destroyed; I went to the church in order to pray.  There were refugees there and it was on that occasion that I heard Father Seromba say, "You see the situation in which the refugees are in.  They have nothing.  Whoever has something can come and help them especially with pots and pans or things like that"? 
Q.	If you recall, Witness, on this day that you said you went to the church, can you tell us what was the date; if you recall? 
A.	At any rate, the church had not yet been destroyed. 
Q.	Do you recall the day of the week, Witness?  Was it a Sunday, for instance? 
A.	All of this happened a long time ago, I wouldn't be able to tell you whether it was a Sunday or another day in the week.  That was 10 years ago.  I am unable to be specific about the exact date of that day. But I believe it was on the 15th or the 16th of April. 
Q.	Witness, if I suggest to you that that the church was destroyed on the 16th of April 1994, what would you say in relation to that? 
A.	I went to the church in the morning.  Maybe church the was destroyed on that very day. 
Q.	Witness, isn't it true that you cannot tell this Court from what you saw on what day or date the refugees started to seek refuge at church? 
A.	One cannot be specific because there were refugees who were leaving clandestinely.  Some refugees would leave during the night and others would come there secretly.  The only person I saw coming there was an old lady who had lost her head and she was in the company of others who had brought her there.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Madam Prosecutor, I don't think we have the translation of your questions in French.  Can you repeat your question just for the record?  
MS. ALEXIS: 
Madam President, let me try to recall what the question was.  Perhaps I can speak to my case manager.  

Yes, Madam President, I am told that the question was: Is it true that you cannot tell this Court on what day or date the refugees started to go to the church.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
Very well, thank you, Madam Prosecutor.
MS. ALEXIS: 
You are welcome, Madam President. 
BY MS. ALEXIS: 
Q.	Witness, since you do not know or you can't recall when the refugees starting going to that church, you don't know, do you know whether they were armed or not; isn't that true? 
A.	I don't know whether the refugees were armed or not. However, I said that in confrontation, the refugees used stones in order to defend themselves. 
Q.	Witness, if I suggest to you that the refugees -- sorry --  the refugees, Witness, if I may suggest to you that on the arrival at church some refugees had traditional weapons and that the Athanase Seromba was amongst those who decided to disarm them.  What would you say? 
MR. NEKUIE:  
Objection, Madam President. I think Witness BZ2 did not dwell on these events and because the Prosecutor should limit herself to her cross-examination to only those events that were mentioned in the examination-in-chief. I request that the Trial Chamber should direct Madam Prosecutor to limit herself the events and only to the rule in respect of cross-examination. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, did you hear the objection? 
MR. NEKUIE: 
If I be granted leave, what is more Madam President, Your Honours, questions should not be leading, but there is a series of three questions that have been mainly leading and I should like the Trial Chamber to recall for the Prosecutor's benefit, the need to comply with the rules. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor. 
MS. ALEXIS: 
Well, Madam president, firstly, I respond to the last point:  The -- I am sorry to my learned friend, but I cannot recall his name, no disrespect to him, but the co-counsel in these proceedings has mentioned that I should be reminded that I am leading questions.  Well in that regard, Madam President, I should like the co-counsel himself to be reminded that this is cross-examination and not examination-in-chief.  And it would be remiss to ask a series of non-leading question in cross-examination.  

In response to the first objection, I would say this, Madam President, I have based my cross-examination or rather the ambit or scope of my cross-examination on 
Rule 90(G)(I) of the Rules of Procedure, and if the Court would permit me, I would read quickly what this session says and I read Madam President: "Cross-examination shall be limited to the subject matter of the examination-in-chief and matters affecting the credibility of the witness and where the witness is able to give evidence relevant to the case for the crossing party to the subject matter of the case".  

So that Madam President, in asking these questions which the witness did not dwell on, I stand squarely on the authority granted to the cross-examine party, by Rule 90, and that there are issues which I asked with a view to seeking whether they are issues which affect the credibility of the witness, and indeed, these are issues which are relevant to our case as the Prosecution so that in this regard I would submit in response to the objection by my learned friend, Mr. Monthé.  That the questions that I had asked for being impermissible fall exactly within the ambit of Rule 90, 
Madam President and I so submit. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, it's not Mr. Monthé, but Mr. Banyue kui whom I have introduced several times. He was the one who raised the objection, not myself. 

Thank you.
MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam President, Your Honours, the Prosecutor has just read the provision on which founded my objection and I am saying, Madam President, Your Honours, that the Prosecution should try and refrain from referring  to questions which deal with the credibility of the witness.  These are facts that the Prosecution is mentioning and tying them to her credibility and this should not be done because this is not the role of the Prosecution in cross-examination.  

Thank you.    
(Pages 18 to 21 by Petrus Chijarira)





















1730H 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please proceed, Madam Prosecutor.  You have leave to put the question to the witness. 
MS. ALEXIS:
I am obliged to the Trial Chamber.  Madam President, if I can kindly be given one moment to find out what was my last question, so that I don't repeat myself.  Thank you, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, do you remember the question that was put to you, Madam Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
If the Prosecution would be so kind as to repeat the question, Madam President.  
MS. ALEXIS:
I will, Madam President. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, my question was this:  I am suggesting to you that when the refugees arrived at the church some of them were armed with traditional weapons, and that Athanase Seromba was amongst the persons who decided to disarm them.  What do you say in response to that suggestion, Witness? 
A.	I think those are lies.  No one could think to take a weapon if he is fleeing.  These refugees expected to be well received, as usual.  And as I said, and Father Seromba said that these people were in trouble.  They had come to that place without bringing anything with them.  They had no property, they had no utensils.  And he never said at any point that these people had been disarmed.  
Q.	On the 10th and 11th of April 1994, Witness, isn't it true that you personally never attended any meetings at the communal office? 
A.	I never took part in any meetings. 
Q.	Witness, did you know that in Kivumu commune there was a security council?  Did you ever hear about this? 
A.	I don't think I know anything about that. 
Q.	Therefore, Witness, if I suggest to you that Athanase Seromba was a member of this security committee, you would not be able assist us; isn't that so, Witness? 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, I object.  This is not a question in the view of the Defence; this is a suggestion that Madam Prosecutor is putting to the witness.  I would like to add at no point in time did the witness mention her participation, or the Accused's membership in any security committee of any sort.  We object to the question being put in those terms. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor, can you respond to the objection. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Yes please, Madam President.  Madam President, yet again, I find recourse in Rule 90(G) of the Rules, which states that the cross-examining party should put its case to the witness.  Madam President, I have tried to familiarise myself with what was the nature of the case that we completed some time in January of this year.  And this, indeed, was part of our case.  And that is why I am making these suggestions.  

Madam President, if I do not put -- or if I do not suggest to this witness what was our case, then the witness may not be in a position to assist us as to what, if anything, she knows about the case.  So again, in synopsis, relying upon Rule 90(G), I felt obliged to, indeed, put my case to the witness.  And that is why I asked that particular question. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, with your leave.  The Prosecution really is reading Rule 90(G)1, but her analysis, her interpretation is faulty.  I shall read this:  "Cross-examination shall be limited to the subject matter of the evidence-in-chief, and matters affecting the credibility of the witness.  And where the witness is able to give evidence relevant to the case for the cross-examining party to the subject matter of the case." This is in view of the examination-in-chief.  So please read -- you are reading Article 90(G)1 and you are analysing it wrongly, which means that your suggestions are not, in this case, justified, and cannot be admitted by the Trial Chamber in our view.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may answer the question, Madam Witness.  

I believe the witness answers questions exactly.  I think it would be well to let the witness answer questions if such questions are put to her with a view to testing her credibility, or to determine what she might have answered if the question had been put to her in the first instance, and if the question is in relation to what has already been said.  

Let us, please, try not to object to all questions and trust the witness even, who was able to give an answer of what she knew to the previous question, and who is able to leave aside what she does not know.  
MS. ALEXIS:
Obliged, Madam President.  
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, did you hear that during the events at Nyange parish in April 1994 that there were some gendarmes present? 
A.	Yes, I heard.  I heard that gendarmes had come. 
Q.	And, Witness, I'm sorry if this seems repetitive, but merely for the record, on the two days before the church was destroyed you had not gone to the church, or near the church; isn't that so, Witness? 

MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, the witness said in response to that question that she had gone to the pharmacy near the church.  Why are they putting the same question to her; she has already answered it?  
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, the witness --  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor. 
MS. ALEXIS:
My apologies, Madam President.  I wished merely to say that the question that I asked, which counsel so correctly stated the answer of the witness, was whether she was there on the day the church was being destroyed; and that is when she said she went to the pharmacy near to the church.  I am merely asking her since -- and I was careful, since she said she couldn't remember the exact date on which the church was destroyed, I am asking her, on the two days prior to that day, whether she went to the church or anywhere near the church.  I'm asking that question, Madam President, to be fair to the witness because of a series of questions that I have to ask thereafter. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please proceed, Madam Prosecutor. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Obliged, Madam President. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Yes, Witness, I will repeat the question.  On the two days prior to your going to the pharmacy on the day the church was being destroyed, did you go to the church or near the church on those two days? 
A.	In the two days preceding the destruction of the church, you said that the church was destroyed on the 16th.  So, it means that it was on the 12th and the 13th.  And I can tell you that I never did go to that place. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  Witness, I am suggesting to you that -- that Athanase Seromba on the days before the destruction of the church asked the gendarmes -- or sorry, told the gendarmes to kill any refugees who went to get bananas from his banana grove.  Are you in a position to respond, Witness? 
A.	No, I know nothing about that. 
Q.	Witness, were you aware -- well, before I ask that question, can you confirm, Witness, that before    April 1994 you were a member of that church at Nyange? 
A.	Yes, I was one of the faithful of the Nyange church. 
Q.	Would you agree, Witness, that in Kivumu commune, at least 85 percent of the population was Catholic? 
A.	I do not know the percentage, but I remember that compared to the other churches that were around there, the Catholics were the majority in that region. 
Q.	Witness, can you confirm to me that -- or, sorry, let me rephrase.  Would you agree with me, Witness, that before its destruction, that the church at Nyange was an enormous church? 
A.	Yes, I agree with you.  I do not know whether you know that church but, yes, it was very big. 
Q.	And would you agree with me, Witness, that the seating capacity of that church at Nyange before its destruction would have been around 1,500 or thereabouts, Witness? 
A.	Yes, as a regular churchgoer, I saw that there were many people, but there was never an announcement made in church as to how many people were there.  What I can confirm is that many people in the area were Catholic, but no figure was ever advanced.  So you shouldn't ask me questions about the number of people who could have stayed or who could have entered and sit -- and be seated in the church. 
Q.	Witness, when you went to the Codekoki on the 16th -- well, sorry, when you went to the Codekoki on the day the church was being destroyed, did you hear that there were more than -- well, at least 2000 refugees inside of the church? 
A.	Really, I must apologise to you, you know, in regard to figures.  I heard that there were refugees, but I don't know that anyone went and counted the refugees.  So, I shall have to ask you not to put questions to me about numbers.  Even if you were there at the scene, you would not have been able to count the refugees; not even the refugees knew how many they were, nobody went to count them. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, when you went to that pharmacy at the Codekoki, can you tell us approximately how long you spent there? 
A.	I stayed for less than five minutes.  I wanted to go to the pharmacy, and I found a group or a crowd of armed people there.  I decided to withdraw, and I observed the scene from a distance.  After that, I went home. 
Q.	Witness, can you confirm -- Witness, can you confirm that you had gone to the pharmacy because your younger child was ill?  Was that your evidence, Witness? 
A.	Yes, I was going to the pharmacy to get some medication as the child was sick. 
Q.	These persons you spoke to, Witness, at the Codekoki, were they some of the attackers at the church, or were they mere spectators? 
A.	The people I was able to approach were spectators, rather, and these people were not armed. 
Q.	Do you recall, Witness, I know it was a long time ago, so I am just asking you if you recall, do you recall who you spoke to at that Codekoki? 
A.	I did not know this person, but this was a Rwandan citizen speaking Kinyarwanda, but I do not know the person's identity.  I just spoke to that person because that person could speak Kinyarwanda and so we were able to communique. 
Q.	At the Nyange parish, Witness, this church of which you were a member, did you know that before   April 1994 there was a parish committee made up of some members of the church? 
A.	Even -- even if I were a member of that church, I was still going to church like any other Christian.  And I was not aware of the existence of this parish council.  And, in any case, I was not involved in these activities.  I must also say that I come from a region from the mountains. 
Q.	I'm sorry, Witness, in your response I heard something about you being from the mountains.  I did not quite understand what I had heard.  Did you say something about being from the mountains, Witness? 
A.	Yes, distance mountains I said.  
Q.	So is it, therefore -- so, is it, therefore, your evidence, Witness, that since you were from the mountains, you did not know whether there was a parish committee; is that your evidence?  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, that is not what the witness said.  The witness made no connection between the parish council and the mountains.  So, it is the Prosecutor who is drawing her own conclusions on that basis. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, would you please rephrase.  That is not exactly what the witness said. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President -- well, I would try to rephrase but the difficulty is that I asked whether the witness knew there was a parish council.  The witness said, she did not know and then proceeded to talk about the mountains, when I asked nothing about the mountains.  So my question was one of clarification to, in fact, ask the witness -- I'm not suggesting it to her, I'm asking her to clarify if, in fact, the reason she mentioned the mountains in response to that question, that is as to -- as to whether there was a parish committee, whether she meant that being from the mountains, she would not know whether there was a parish committee. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But the last part of your question is a bit of a problem, you see. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Very well, Madam President.  I will rephrase. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, you mentioned being from the mountains.  Can you tell us what that reference -- what did you refer to when you spoke about being from the mountains? 
A.	I thought that you were asking me if in grassroots communities that were near the church, I was a member of the committee; or perhaps, if you wish, you might repeat the question and put the question to me regarding the parish council, and then I'm going to think about it and give you an answer. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Okay, Madam President, I would follow the instruction of the witness.  
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	As a member of the Nyange parish church, did you know that there was a parish committee which was formed from some members of that church, and I'm speaking of before April 1994? 
A.	Yes, I knew this. 
Q.	And for the record, Witness, can you confirm that, in fact, you were not one of the members of this parish committee? 
A.	Yes, that is true.  I was not a member of the parish council.
Q.	Isn't it therefore true, Witness, that since you were not a member, you were not in a position to say what decisions were made at that parish committee? 
A.	That is correct, I could not know what decisions were taken inside of this council if I were not a member of it. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, I am looking at the time.  I have a series of questions which, if I begin them, would take us well over the time of 6 p.m.  So, if at all this is a convenient moment for the Trial Chamber, it will be a convenient moment for me, if it pleases the Trial Chamber to take the day's break at this time. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Monthé.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, I would like to say in the interest of the Accused and the Trial Chamber is aware of, there is a problem with late returns to the detention centre, and security matters that you have had to make decisions on in this Trial Chamber.  So, I think Madam Prosecutor is quite right, and for once the Defence would agree with her. Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber is of the same opinion because you have the interpreters and a great number of people who have to be able to leave here at an appropriate time.  But the question is whether we are to start at 2 o'clock or 2:30 p.m.?   If the parties would be so kind as to wait with us, we are going to see, in consultation with the registry, whether it is possible to meet with the -- to start at 2 o'clock instead of 2:30, if that is all right?  

Madam Witness, you may well be tired after these questions and I wouldn't be surprised.  We are going to stop work for now.  And tomorrow you will still come to court for the continuation of the cross-examination of the Prosecutor.  We thank you and we would like to remind you that you are still under oath.  You may not discuss this case with anyone whatsoever.  Thank you.

Good evening, everyone.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.   
(Court adjourned at 1806H)
