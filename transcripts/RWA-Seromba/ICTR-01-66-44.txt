P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
   This session is opened.  Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.  Witness good afternoon to you. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
CF14, Prosecutor, rather Counsel Nekuie, will you please go ahead with the examination of the witness. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, the Defence has some problems.  We have just received a work programme concerning the organization of the sessions. I think I must say we have been surprised.  This is an unusual procedure and probably I might even say it was discourteous because we always come here to work on a programme that has been agreed upon.  Once in, we might be accused of not being correct, but I think the Chamber has not taken into account some of the elements that I gave concerning the programme of the witnesses - - concerning the difficulties we meet especially W - with the Witness Protection.  Once again, I am surprised by this message.  So I thought I should bring this information to your notice Madam President, Your Honours.  This is a major concern to us. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, we were just talking about this particular issue because we - - are of the same opinion as yourselves, because this information should not have been circulated before we the parties agreed on it, that is the Prosecutor and yourselves.  We were trying to find a way of catching up with the -- on the days that we are unfortunately going to lose - - that is Monday 5th and Tuesday 6th December, because I have to go to The Hague because I have a session there.  

I will, unfortunately, not be back until Wednesday.  So, we were trying to look at -- with 
Presiding Judge Byron on the Rwamakuba affair - - Rwamakuba case how we could work out the programme.  As a matter of fact, this programme should not have been distributed as before. 
MR. MONTHÉ:  
Madam President, may I ask whether I should consider this problem as not being valid?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It's not conclusive.  This is a proposal that we want to discuss with you first. 
MR. MONTHÉ:  
Thank you, Madam President. Madam President, thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If you will, can we start with the witness.  And during the break would like to meet the parties so as to agree on this work programme.  

Thank you, Counsel Nekuie, you have the floor. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, Your Honours, I would like to continue with my examination-in-chief of Witness CF14 and your -- Witness CF14, I --. 
WITNESS CF14
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. NEKUIE: 
Q.	Witness CF14, good afternoon.
A.	Good afternoon to you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nekuie, we just want to draw your attention that this is an open session. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yesterday, I understood that the Chamber decided to go into open session in spite of the concerns of the Defence. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we were going to ask you to be very -- to answer attentively, to listen attentively to the questions that are going to be put to you and to request you not to disclose any names of people or of places which might lead to disclosure of your identification because we would not like anybody outside this Tribunal to know who is testifying now.  
THE WITNESS: 
That is right. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
May I continue, Madam President?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please go ahead. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Madam.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness CF14, I hope you are still in the same condition as  you were in yesterday and I will go ahead then and ask you questions.  Is that okay? 
A.	Yes, you are right. 
Q.	Very well. In order to remind ourselves of what happened, I would like to remind you that, yesterday, by the time we went for our break, I was asking you for the number of days during which the refugees managed to get foodstuffs at Nyange parish.  And if I recall very well, you said that they managed to go on that way on the 3rd and 14th and 15th of 1994.  Would you like to confirm that please? 
A.	We started from the 12th because I know that on the 12th when the bourgmestre brought the refugees to the parish in the morning and which he did also on the 13th, I know that by then, the refugees were able to go and find food.  They could go to the market, to the trading centre. In addition, friends of those refugees or their friends would bring them foodstuffs.  Let me add also that the refugees could cook their own food somewhere. I, personally, saw where they were cooking their food from as such on the 12th and the 13th; the refugees had food to eat. It was on the fourth day that I came to learn that an attack led by Ndungutse had been led against the refugees, but I heard of that later. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When you say that they could go to the market on the 12th, the 13th and 
	the 14th, if I understood you well, does that mean that there was no obstacle between the parish and the place where they went to buy food? 
A.	Well, I think-- I don't think there was any obstacle whatsoever except on the 14th when an attack was launched,  but I just heard of that, but I remember that on the days preceding the attack, they could go to the market without a problem.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And, we were told, in this Chamber where you are testifying now, that roadblocks had been erected around the church to prevent the refugees from going out of the church.  Would you say "yes" or "no" to those allegations?  Where there roadblocks - - according to you, were there roadblocks around that church? 
A.	Regarding this issue of roadblocks around the church, I am able to confirm them -- to confirm it because I never saw them. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You're saying that on the 14th, there was an attack, were you able to know who launched that attack and did you ever get to know how that attack was launched? 
A.	Look, you asked me not to mention names. Now, you were asking me questions as to who attacked and where the attack came from.  Must I mention the names?  What should I say?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam President, can I make a proposal to the witness to perhaps mention the titles of the persons who were involved, perhaps it could help us out?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We don't see any difficulties with regard to that question, due to the last question.  He may mention names if he so wishes. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
All right, madam President. So I will tell the witness to describe the attack by mentioning, if he so wishes, the names of the people involved. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:  
Q.	Witness, you can go ahead and mention the names of those who were involved? 
A.	Regarding the attack of 14th, I was not present, but I was told that Ndungutse led that attack and that the attackers had come from Murambi.  There were Tutsis who were inside at the church and who were killed by the attackers during the attack of the 14th.  When the attackers arrived at the church, they found the refugees inside the church.  I came to learn that the attackers went to the communal brigadier to give them weapons and he refused to do so, but I want to point out that I was not an eyewitness to this, I was told of the story by some other people. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness. This Ndungutse, you are talking of Witness CF14, who was a military leader in the commune? 
A.	This said Ndungutse was a teacher.  He was a teacher in a school somewhere in Kigali.  He was also one of the members of the MRND committee in the commune.  That's all I know about that Ndungutse. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And the witnesses who were heading towards the church, were they the same who attacked the old Mwendezi whom you talked of yesterday in Nyangndara? 
A.	No.  The attackers who killed Ndakubatana and his family members, including one Ruzirabova, were the first attackers who killed people in Kivumu commune and they are the ones who killed the members of the Ndakubatana's family. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness CF14.  Were you able to know whether during the attack of 14th of April 1994, there were any gendarmes among the attackers? 
A.	Well, in any case, there some gendarmes at the church.  They didn't do anything to protect those who were being attacked and I learned that the attackers went to ask for ammunition from the commune brigadier and he refused to give them ammunition.  That's all I came to know about. 
Q.	Thank you.  According to you, the gendarmes who were at the church, were they working under the instructions of Father Seromba? 
A.	Are you talking of the 14th?  Well those gendarmes, in my opinion, well, this is my personal opinion because I was not there, but I -- those gendarmes were not being commanded by Father Seromba.    They were sent there by the government, but they did not do anything to protect the population that was there.  That was why they had been posted there.  I don't understand how father Seromba could have been one - - the one to give them orders, the orders they came with.  They came with their orders from Kibuye. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Since you talk about those gendarmes, can you tell this Chamber about how gendarmes would be posted to work in a particular place at the time? 
A.	In my opinion, the coordinator of the activities of the gendarmes was the judicial police inspector, the criminal investigations officer and the bourgmestre who ordered them. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  So if I understand you well, the main authorities in the community, you said it already, but would you like to confirm it once again, that it was the criminal investigations officer and the bourgmestre? 
A.	The main authorities in the commune as I said yesterday, were the bourgmestre, the communal brigadier and the criminal investigations officer.  Those were the main authorities in the commune. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Was it the bourgmestre who had the power to solicit for gendarmes to work in their commune, was it like that at the time? 
A.	Yes.  It is clear, it was the bourgmestre who went to look for those gendarmes to come and give us support to provide security starting from the 11th.  Trouble broke out.  The gendarmes even went to the Gojo secteur and they noticed that there was instability there.  The bourgmestre asked for assistance and they refused.  That is when people noticed that there were gendarmes, but they were not doing anything.  What was happening, as far as I am concerned, those gendarmes who came from Kibuye did not come to restore order?  They came to kill.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Since you were not there, I would, all the same, want ask you whether you came to know whether during the attack of the 14th April 1994, there were victims both among the attackers and the refugees.  
A.	By then nobody had been killed because the attackers went to look for guns and ammunition to -- from the brigadier.  They asked for firearms and ammunition and he told them that he did not have - - he was not authorised to give them what they were asking for.  So the refugees remained at the church. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  Then we come to the next day, 15th of April 1994, did you ever go to Nyange church? 
A.	On 15th of April, I went to Nyange church in the afternoon.  On arrival there, I noticed that the situation was castrophe, people had been killed.  People had been killed following a grenade that had been thrown by a reservist.  I found the criminal investigations officer of the commune, there was also Ndungutse who had grenades.  There were of course some other people.  I saw also************** I am sorry, I thought you had asked me not to mention names, but I am again beginning to mention one name too many.  Can I continue?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Indeed, we need the names, because if you find such persons, you mention might identify you. 
THE WITNESS:
Okay. I understand well, I found there are many people, as I said, and they were saying that they had tried to burn the doors to the church, but their efforts were so far in vain.  That's the situation I found on the ground when I got there. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nekuie, don't you think that he is able to write down the names of some of the people? 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam President, I mentioned yesterday that my witness does -- is totally illiterate; he can't read or write, not even in Kinyarwanda.  And if you will remark -- you will notice that he will be obliged to mention names practically throughout the time he will be testifying. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is it possible that one of the interpreters can assist us from the Kinyarwanda booth?  Can you please sit next to the witness and assist him in this exercise?  Registry, kindly gives them a sheet of paper and something to write with.  

Counsel, we are going to make an attempt. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam President, may I understand what, exactly, are we going to be doing?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, instead of saying the names out loud, the witness is going to whisper the names to the interpreter.  That interpreter will write those names down.  Now, of course, we are going to put numbers next to each name written down.  After that we can tender the document into evidence.  So let's begin with number 1.  Interpreter, please write the name that is given to you and you put a "One" next to that name. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Yes, Madam President. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam President, if you have already established a name of -- a list, rather, of names for this witness that will facilitate this exercise because if the witness whispers a name to the interpreter, the interpreter could kindly check off that name on the pre-established list. 
MR. MONTHÉ:  
Madam President, with your leave, let me go back over this procedure, just to bring out the truth.  The transcripts are authoritative. We all must be aware of what he is saying at the same time.  If a name is written down on a piece of paper and if that is tendered into evidence, how are we going to evaluate both we and the Prosecutor, what he said?  What I suggest, Madam President is we are making this complicated when it is very easy.  We simply can go into close session and deal with these matters.  As soon as we finish with these matters, we can go into open session.  This exercise seems very complicated and fraught with difficulties.  Pardon me for saying that, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Yes, the microphones have come back, it appears. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, do you have any observation, Mr. Prosecutor?  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, I don't know whether it will assist because it may not contain all the names that my learned friend wants to refer to but I have prepared a list of names which certainly includes, I believe, the name which the witness was about to refer to and in open session.  I don't know if that list does assist the Defence.  I am happy for them to use it.  It has a list of names of people with numbers beside them and certainly I believe that list, if my friend looks at it, will refer to Number 15 on that list as being the name of the person.  

Now, I am simply tendering it, I have given my friend a copy. I don't know, it may not contain all the names, but I think it will contain at least a certain number of them that they may wish to refer to and if it does assist him, I am happy for them to use that document. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Madam President, Your Honours.  We certainly appreciate the Prosecutor's efforts, but I am wondering if it might not have legal consequences and prejudice us. I don't see Madam President, how during the testimony of the Defence witness the Prosecution finds it normal to furnish the Defence and thereby contribute to how the examination is conducted.  It seems difficult to me, but I simply leave this matter up to the Chamber. 
MR. MOSES: 
I will take the document back, Your Honours, but I was trying to assist - - but if it is not going to assist, if he could please return the document and I will use it subsequently. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  

I believe that the interpreter is someone that we can all trust and if the interpreter writes down the name, you would agree with me, that, indeed, that is the name that the witness gave.  I don't see how or why the interpreter would write down a name that that the witness did not give.  That document will be tendered into evidence in this case.  And, of course, you will have an opportunity to see the document before it is tendered.  We have done this on many occasions before this Tribunal before, believe me. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, I'm not doubting your honesty or good faith. If we have this audio system, it is indeed to enable us all to hear at the same time what is said.  In the interests of the manifestation of the truth, I have nothing against this interpreter who is a very nice person, but as an attorney in good faith, I don't want to lead to these kinds of issues.  That's why I have reservations. I just think we are running some risks.  There would be a problem if I am not certain that is the name that the witness gave and then I will have to raise legal issues with the Chamber.  Madam President, now of course, you are in control of these proceedings.  It is your responsibility.  We will simply take notes and raise these issues if there are any. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We understand, Mr. Monthé very clearly. 

Mr. Interpreter, thank you very much.  We apologise, but so as not to run any risk whatsoever, we are simply going to go into closed session, that way the witness can say the names out loud.  That is to avoid any risks. 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: 
Thank you, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
 We are going to move to a closed session.  We're doing this for the protection of this witness and for the interest of justice. 

Mr. Nekuie.
