P R O C E E D I N G S 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Proceedings are called to order.  Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.  

Before we hear Witness BR1, we are seeking information about the next witnesses intended to appear next week.  And for that information, we should like to hand the floor to the representative of WVSS.  

Could you kindly tell us which witnesses will be arriving and, if they are not here, what are the reasons for that. 
MR. KALUMO:  
Thank you, Your Honour.  I'm the head of security movement unit, and the colleague who is dealing with this matter, calling witnesses from wherever they are, is Mr. Essombe, the head of support unit.  And right now he's in another meeting with the registry.  And I propose, if it is possible, that after this session -- after the break that he comes and gives the Chamber the information that is required.  

Thank you, Your Honour.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We do not understand why no one can give us information about witnesses who were planned for next week.  We seek this information as quickly as possible.  It is inadmissible (sic) for us not to have information for witnesses who are supposed to appear on Monday and it is Friday already.  So as -- at the latest, at 11:15 at the break, we seek this information with regard to these witnesses.  

We are going to begin now.  We've lost a lot of time for nothing.  Kindly bring in the witness.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Madam Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, you are protected Defence witness.  You shall be referred to as BR1 before this Court.  That is to avoid revealing your identity.  You will first be questioned by the Defence and then cross-examined by the Prosecution.  It is also possible that the Defence conducts a re-examination of you, and it is also possible that the Judges ask you questions for clarification.  Witness, we ask you to listen attentively to the questions that are put to you and to answer them as briefly and concisely as possible.  

Before you begin answering the questions, we should like to ask you to take a solemn declaration. 
(Declaration made by Witness BR1 in Kinyarwanda) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Witness.  

Mr. Monthé, are you going to examine this witness? 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You have the floor, Mr. Monthé. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, Your Honours, good morning. 
WITNESS BR1,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Madam Witness, good morning.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I seek leave from the Chamber to have the registry collect a document.  It shall be distributed to the parties.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness BR1, before you you have a document that contains information about your identity.  Could you kindly read that document and indicate to the Chamber whether or not the information on the document is true and correct.  
A.	The information on this document is indeed true and correct with regard to me. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, with regard to that confirmation of that information by the witness, we kindly request that this document be tendered as a Defence exhibit.  It should be marked D. 61.  And we request that it be placed under seal, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, any objections? 
MS. ALEXIS:
None, please, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No objections.  Very well.  We thank you.  

The identification sheet for Witness BR1 is tendered, admitted, and marked as a Defence exhibit.  It shall be marked D. 61.  The document is placed under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. 61 admitted, under seal)  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  Without further delay, I should like to begin the examination-in-chief of BR1.  Madam President, with regard to the orders you made previously, I should request that we begin the examination-in-chief in a closed session.  
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, Your Honours, even if this issue has already been discussed, I think it would be a good idea to have this mentioned for the record.  Mr. Monthé, if he has issues with this, can argue his motion in closed session, but otherwise we should have the proceedings in an open session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Monthé, we, in fact, wanted to ask, indeed, did you have a problem submitting your arguments in an open session with regard to why you want a closed session? 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, Madam President.  I did not want to begin there.  We've already dealt with this issue, I believe.  My concern, which is also that of the Chamber and that of this Tribunal, is to make sure that the witnesses who come here to contribute to justice do not have their identity revealed, which may compromise their security.  That is why, after I spoke about these matters with the Office of the Prosecutor, I mentioned that this witness would talk about some persons who were even here and some names.  Without a doubt, by mentioning those names, that will reveal her identity.  The Defence does not want to take any risks and, out of an abundance of caution and out of respect for this witness, the Defence requested that this hearing begin in the closed session.  After that, we will see the development of the examination to see whether or not we can move back to an open session.  

That is why, Madam President, I requested a closed session.  Myself, I prefer an open session, but for this particular witness, we wanted a closed session.  

Those are my reasons, Madam President.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Monthé.  

Madam Prosecutor, do you have any objections?  
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, Your Honours, in principle there is no objection.  Each time there are questions that deal with the identity of the witnesses, a request for a closed session is certainly justified.  On this issue there is no objection.  But to request a closed session for the entirety of the witness's testimony, in our view, is not justified.  Certainly there will be questions that may be risky and reveal the identity for -- of this witness, but this matter should be dealt with on a rolling basis.  

The questions that may reveal this witness's identity are the only ones that should be put to the witness in a closed session under the control of your Honourable Chamber.  But to ask off the bat for a closed session, in our view, is not justifiable.  

If the Defence has particular reasons for why it requests a closed session now, it should explain those to the Chamber.  Perhaps those issues can be dealt with in a closed session.  And nothing is prohibiting the Defence from asking for a closed session to deal with those matters.  Nevertheless, the Defence must expose its reasons for why it requests the closed session.  That request must be justified.  

For the time being, the Prosecution does -- is not convinced, does not have the arguments for why the closed session is being requested.  As such, I am opposed to a blanket closed session, and we await the Defence arguments specifically, even if they must be dealt with in a closed session.  As such, the Defence's submissions will be put on record, the reasons why it is requesting a closed session for this particular witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The Chamber is going to order a closed session.  

Counsel, perhaps you might explain in detail in that closed session why you wish to have the testimony of this witness in a closed session.  We also ask you to group all of your questions that should be put in the closed session together so that we may move to an open session after those questions are dealt with.  

We are now going to move to a closed session.  Registry, kindly assist us.  

We are going to move to a closed session for the protection of this witness and in the interests of justice.  We apologise to any inconvenience caused to the public.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are now in an open session.  

Counsel, you may continue with your -- with the examination-in-chief of this witness. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness BR1, so you were from Nyange.  Was there a parish in Nyange? 
A.	Yes, in Nyange there was a parish. 
Q.	Thank you.  Can you please tell the Chamber whether you were -- ever went to that parish in 1994? 
A.	Yes.  In 1994 I would attend Mass there. 
Q.	Thank you.  Were you one of the faithful of this parish, Witness BR1? 
A.	Yes, I was one of the faithful of that parish because I was born there, and I was one of the faithful until I went into exile. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BR1.  When you used to attend Mass at that parish, can you please tell us, or tell the Chamber, who was the parish priest.  
A.	That depends on the period of time.  Because from time to time, the parish priest would change.  I remember the last parish priest, and he was called Straton.  I do not know his surname, but his first name was Straton.  There was also Father Boniface Sinyenzi. 
Q.	Thank you.  If I were to ask you who was a priest of Nyange parish in April 1994, what would your answer be? 
A.	It was indeed Father Straton. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, in 1994, was there another priest apart from Father Straton, who was the parish priest?  Was there another priest? 
A.	I didn't quite understand your question.  Can you please repeat it for me.  
Q.	I will do so, Witness BR1.  I was asking you this question:  Apart from the parish priest who was Father Straton, was there any other priest at Nyange parish in 1994, April 1994? 
A.	Of course, the parish priest -- priest was Father Straton.  There was another priest, who was Seromba, and he was the vicar.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness BR1.  Did you ever have the opportunity to get into -- to get in touch with Father Seromba during that period of time? 
A.	Throughout the period that Seromba was in Nyange, each time there was a Mass, I would meet him at the end of Mass.  Because at the end of the Mass, the faithful would greet the priest, and I did have some discussions with Father Seromba. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BR1.  So you who often discussed with Father Seromba, can you please tell this Chamber what was the nature of the relationship between the parish priest, in other words, Father Straton, and Father Athanase Seromba.  
A.	The relationship between the two priests was not good.  There was a conflict based on supplies from CARITAS.  CARITAS was a humanitarian organisation which was distributing aid to the poor, and CARITAS would distribute these supplies.  So Father Straton, instead of distributing the supplies or assistance to the poor, he would rather distribute it to his friends.  He wanted to have this aid benefit his friends rather than the poor.  And I think that was the basis of the conflict between Straton and Seromba, because they didn't understand one another on the way in which the assistance should be distributed. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BR1.  Can you please tell the Chamber whether the conflict between Father Seromba and Straton did not have a -- an ethnic background to it.  Wasn't it because Father Straton was Tutsi? 
A.	The conflict between them was not based on ethnicity.  Because Father Straton did not only have a conflict between himself and Father Seromba.  Father Straton had conflicts with other priests who came to that parish, and there was another priest, Father Eugene, who fought with Father Straton.  And it was due to a conflict, whose details I do not know and into which I cannot go.  

And that is -- it is known that Father Eugene and Father Straton fought.  But Eugene was Tutsi.  There was Kayiranga, Irba (phonetic), and all these priests.  They would only spend a -- a year in Nyange because Father Straton was a difficult person.  He had a bad character, and he would malign the other priests. 
Q.	Thank you.  When you say that he would malign the other priests -- priests, can you please give us an example of that malignment of the other priests by Father Straton.  
A.	I remember very well that it was on a Sunday.  It was towards the end of January.  Father Seromba had gone to Ruhengeri for a meeting.  I do not know why he did not come back to the parish, as had been expected.  But at the parish there was supposed to be two Mass services, as usual.  

Father Straton said the first Mass, and during the time when the information was being given to the faithful, he said that there was not going to be a second Mass because their vicar had become a rogue and he was not present.  So the second Mass took place at the central office and not in the main church.  And it was Father Straton who said that Mass.  He said that the vicar had disappeared and that he had become delinquent.  

So you would, therefore, understand that the parish priest should not have spoken such words.  So there must have been, of necessity, difficulties with his colleagues.  In any case, if there was a problem, he should have discussed this with his colleagues and not mention it publicly to the faithful.  He knew very well that Father Seromba had gone to Ruhengeri for a meeting. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BR1.  Should the Chamber understand from that, Witness BR1, that the parishioners were aware of the conflict existing between Father Seromba and the parish priest, Father Seromba -- Father Straton? 
A.	The officials of grassroots communities and the CARITAS officials were aware of this fact.  Generally speaking, everyone was complaining and wondering why the parish priest, Father Straton, could not be on good terms with his colleagues.  And they were wondering why every year there was a new priest because that situation had never happened before.  The parish priests had previously been on good terms with their priests.  But from the arrival of Father Straton, there were -- was an -- a new arrival of priests every year.  And when Sinyenzi, who was a priest, who was the parish priest when Straton was a priest, and it was compared with the time when Father Straton, being the parish priest, fought with Sinyenzi. 
Q.	Witness, can you please tell the Chamber, if you know, why Father Straton had Father Sinyenzi beaten up.  
A.	I did not get to know why the conflict between the two priests, but Father Straton plotted against Father Sinyenzi and had him beaten.  And amongst those who beat him up, there was one Kabundi (phonetic). 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BR1.  Do you know -- did you get to know what was the ethnicity of Father Sinyenzi? 
A.	Father Sinyenzi was a Tutsi. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BR1.  Witness, when did you get to know about the destruction of President Habyarimana's plane, and where were you? 
A.	I learnt of the destruction of the plane of President Habyarimana in the afternoon of the 7th of 
	April 1994, and I got to know this on the news on Radio Rwanda. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness R -- BR1.  What did you do when you got to hear that news on the radio? 
A.	Through the information that came out on the radio, there was a communiqué saying that we should remain at home.  

But, given the nature of my job, I would like to answer this question -- answer this question in a closed session, if possible.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President.

1010H 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Monthé, we shall reserve the answer from the witness to this question for a bit later, and you can continue with your other questions. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness BR1, please keep a small space in your head for the answer to that; we will come back to it later.  Witness BR1, can you please tell us what happened; what was the atmosphere in your commune when the destruction of the presidential plane was announced and the announcement also of his death? 
A.	After the destruction of President Habyarimana's plane, many members of the population were aware of the news and were concerned and were afraid; others were wondering the outcome, what the outcome of the situation would be.  The inhabitants of that commune seemed to be pitted against one another.  There was tension between Hutus and Tutsi. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BR1.  Why are you saying that there was tension between the Hutus and Tutsi; did you know why? 
A.	It is because everybody was afraid; Tutsi thought that they were going to be killed.  And Hutus were also afraid because the war was ongoing in the country.  Some people were saying that it was the Inkotanyi who had attacked the country; others were wondering how to behave given the death of the president.  And there were so many problems, such that the inhabitants were afraid.  The inhabitants of the country were afraid. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BR1.  Could you please indicate to us the dates which this incident occurred; obviously, only if you remember? 
A.	After the president of the republic's plane was destroyed the inhabitants were afraid, and around the 10th, since Tutsi were afraid, and some Hutu were also afraid, and I can mention my own example, but I will come to the explanation a little bit later because that might reveal my identity.  
      
Now, Tutsi, people went to seek -- Tutsi went to seek refuge at the church, and others who also were afraid went to seek refuge elsewhere. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BR1.  When the Tutsi began to go and seek refuge at the parish, can you please tell us exactly when that occurred, if you recall? 
A.	The ones that I saw for the first time when they were on their way to the parish, I met around the 10th.  There were some, whom I met, and I spoke with them and they told me that they were going to the parish. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you ever get the opportunity yourself to go to the parish during this period of time? 
A.	I went there because I had gone to attend Mass at the church. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When the refugees went to the parish, were the latter attacked when they got there; and if so, could you please tell us exactly when they were attacked. 
A.	The refugees at the parish were attacked.  And I believe they were attacked around the 14th.  It was on that date that the first attacks occurred.  And these attacks continued. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When you say that the initial attacks took place on the 14th, this is, indeed, the 14th of April 1994; isn't it? 
A.	Yes, quite so, I'm speaking about the 14th of April 1994. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you witness those attacks, or were you only told about them? 
A.	There are some which I saw myself and others which were related to me. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BR1.  Now for us to be systematic and chronological, I would like to start with the attacks that you saw yourself; could you please tell us about them? 
A.	The attack which I witnessed myself was that of the 15th of April, and it was around 10 a.m.  I was an eyewitness. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BR1.  Since you experienced these events, could you please tell the Chamber how that attack of 15th of April 1994 actually took place? 
A.	I did not see the attack, when it started or when it ended.  I came to the place when I was on my way to the burial of one Ntawuruhunga.  We were on a vehicle and I would like to give you details in closed session, but I can tell you a little about that now.  We were on a vehicle with some other people and when we came to the statue of the Virgin Mary we found many attackers who were in that place, such that the vehicle could no longer advance.

The Hutus were down below in the square, near the statue of the Virgin Mary, whereas the Tutsis were on the road going up towards the parish.  We were unable to proceed any further and we had to turn back to find another way to the main road so that we can continue on with the burial of that doctor.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness BR1.  Could you please tell us who was this Dr. Ntawuruhunga?  For the record, Madam President, the last name is spelt N-T-A-W-U-R-U-H-U-N-G-A, and the first name is Juvénal.  

Witness BR1, let me repeat my question.  Who was this Dr. Juvénal Ntawuruhunga? 
A.	Dr. Juvénal Ntawuruhunga was a native of my commune.  He had his practice at the -- at the CHK, the central hospital in Kigali, and he was from this commune.  All of the inhabitants liked him, especially those who had the means to be able to benefit from treatment at the Kigali hospital.  He would help them to get appointments and to get in touch with the appropriate doctors.  Particularly, he helped the members of the family of one person who was hospitalised in Kigali, especially in providing supplies.  He was a doctor who was liked very much in our area.  He had good morals. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BR1.  Now, did you ever get to understand under what circumstances this doctor died? 
A.	The news that we heard spoke of how this doctor was killed by Inkotanyi. 
Q.	Thank you.  Can you please inform the Chamber whether the announcement of this doctor's death created a lot of sadness in your commune, and whether the community was distressed by his death? 
A.	This news saddened and annoyed the members of the population, and something happened to me on the day of the burial, I was an eyewitness of an incident.  We were on a vehicle which was going to the burial; we met many people, more than 30 or 40.  And these people were carrying traditional weapons, such as machetes, spears and clubs.  And when they saw our vehicle, they were unable to identify us and they stood on the road and blocked our way.  The driver had to stop the vehicle.  And these people identified me, although they were unable to identify the driver, who was not from Nyange, I was identified together with another person whose name I shall not mention for fear of my being identified.  
      
So these people identified us and then they asked us where we were going.  And we said we were going to bury Dr. Ntawuruhunga.  They said, "Go ahead to his burial.  We know those who are responsible for his death, and we shall also bury them."  So we continued on our way.  And most of those who came to his burial were women.  There were a few men.  We would hear shouts, and the men were shouting and seemed to be on a hunt.  So I was an eyewitness to that incident. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BR1.  Witness BR1, on the 11th of April, did you go to Mass at the parish? 
A.	Yes, I went there. 
Q.	Thank you.  On that occasion, Witness BR1, did you meet Father Athanase Seromba? 
A.	We met at the end of the Mass.  Furthermore, we spoke as we were going into the inner courtyard of the presbytery.  He asked me -- he was saying that we could have a discussions after having done one particular job which was urgent.  If you wish, I can tell you about it.  It is not a secret.  I went into the inner courtyard of the presbytery with Father Seromba.  We had written a pamphlet to him, which said "Father Seromba, if you continue to shelter Tutsi, we shall kill you with them."  So he was in a hurry to go and inform the Bishop of the situation which was prevailing.  I was present; he informed the Bishop about the pamphlet.  And the Bishop asked him to ensure that those people were safe and sound. 
Q.	Thank you, BR1.  Now, you talked about the circumstances of the attack of 15th April that you witnessed; were you also there when the church was destroyed? 
A.	I did not see the church being destroyed.  But there was shouting and noise.  And from the hill you could hear the noise.  There was a a very loud noise, booming, and that was when the -- when the tower came down.  At the time I was quite close to the communal office. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BR1.  Witness, can you tell the Chamber if, during the events at Nyange, which are of interest to us here, you remained at home or -- you remained in the same home, or did you change homes? 
A.	I think I can give that answer in a closed session. 
Q.	Thank you, BR1.  BR1, during those events were any roadblocks erected in your commune? 
A.	Roadblocks were erected very early.  When there was tension between the Hutus and Tutsi, roadblocks were set up.  The people thought that the Inyenzi and Inkotanyi could infiltrate the communities, so the roadblocks were set up to stop such infiltration of Inkotanyi and Inyenzi, so there was roadblocks.  And I remember there was one at the marketplace, there was another one at a place called Kucyapa (phonetic). 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BR1.  Witness BR1, you said that roadblocks were used to stop the infiltration of Inyenzi and Inkotanyi; what do you mean by Inyenzi and Inkotanyi?  Who are they? 
A.	During that time of insecurity, those who were referred to as Inyenzi or Inkotanyi, were Inkotanyi who came from outside of the country, they had attacked our country.  However, Inyenzi, was a term used to refer to Tutsi.  The terms were sometimes mixed up. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You talked about roadblocks; do you know whether or not Father Seromba was involved in setting them up or manning them? 
A.	Father Seromba never went to a roadblock whatsoever. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BR1.  BR1, it was said that meetings were organised in Nyange, both at the parish and at the Codekoki building and the purpose of the meetings were to exterminate the Tutsi in the commune.  And the meetings, it was said, were organised by Father Seromba.  Do you know anything about this, Witness? 
A.	In my view those meetings never took place, I never saw any meetings being held at the communal office.  I went there several times, even at the parish when I went to Mass I never saw any meetings being held there, meetings that would be held to exterminate the Tutsi, in the commune I was never a witness to such meetings. 
Q.	Witness BR1.  So what do you say about those who say that the extermination of the Tutsi was planned in the commune? 
A.	I would say that those people are lying, that never happened.  Maybe we can talk about the fact that certain people were angry with one another and there were confrontations or unrest, but no one prepared anything or planned anything with regard to that unrest. 
Q.	Thank you BR1.  BR1, you were a regular at the parish, can you tell the Chamber that if, besides  Father Seromba, during the time of those events were there any other priest at Nyange parish? 
A.	There were other priests, namely Edwourd Nturiye, François Kayiranga, and Father Balthazar. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you personally know those clergy members? 
A.	I knew Father Nturiye and Father Kayiranga, I saw Father Balthazar at that time, but I didn't know him prior to that time. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness BR1, it was said that those -- let me repeat my question; it was said that those clergy members participated in the events at Nyange; what do you say about that? 
A.	People who say such things are liars.  Father Nturiye and Father Kayiranga lived at Nundu^.  I don't know where Father Balthazar lived.  They came from Nundu^.  I don't think they are on their way to kill, so those who say such things are lying. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  

MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, I am moving towards the end of my examination in chief, but I do have three or    four remaining questions.  For the witness to answer them fully, we may need to move into a closed session and I apologise for being right sometimes, and we, unfortunately, have to do this. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, counsel.

Madam Prosecutor.  
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, this is very appropriately done, and we have no objections. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are going to move into a closed session.  This is for the protection of this witness and in the interests of justice.  
MR. MONTHÉ:  
I thank the Chamber, Madam President.

(Pages 12 to 16 by Donna M. Lewis)



















MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are resumed.  Mr. Essombe is here as representative from WVSS.  

Mr. Essombe, you have the floor immediately.  And please tell us if we will have witnesses for next week.  We heard that there may be some difficulties.  You have the floor, Mr. Essombe.
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, Your Honours we do have, in fact, some difficulties.  Before I speak about them I want to give you an idea of what is in store for later.  We have         Witness NA1 who will arrive on the 1st of December; Witness FE25 will be here on the 9th of December; Witness PA1, as a result of some difficulties will not be here until the next session.  These are administrative difficulties.  The plan for bringing the witnesses, as it was implemented, had detained witnesses coming here this weekend.  They were supposed to begin to arrive.

Where we stand today, it turns out that only today can we have the official answer from the ministry of justice.  We were promised an answer a while ago.  That never happened.  This morning -- and, in fact, after I got out of the meeting I was in this morning, I called our colleagues in Kigali.  They told us that they finally received the response from the ministry of justice just this morning.  That is the situation, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
A week ago, it seems, we were at the same stage; so from what I understand, there have been no new developments since.
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:
Madam President, I wouldn't exactly present things in that manner.  There has been, certainly, a slow development.  You will remember last week I told you that some jurisdictions decided to change the procedure.  But since we were not told officially, we had hoped that things would proceed as they always had.  Given that, there has been some development. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So, if you receive the response from the ministry of justice today, will the witnesses begin to arrive as early as Monday?  
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:
No, Madam President, in fact, we need an order. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
According to 90 bis, that order we can sign it immediately as soon as WVSS confirms that they have received an answer from the ministry of justice.  We want to know if we can receive witnesses next week.  I have been able to hear the witnesses that are here.  And there is only one remaining and that will be a cross-examination.  We will certainly have finished with all of those witnesses by Monday and what are we to do Tuesday, Wednesday, et cetera?  We have to work next week. 
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:
If an order is made today, Madam President, the normal procedure has it that the immigration services in Rwanda will react in ten days.  We have asked them to react more quickly.  However, it will not be less than five working days before they respond. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are in a very difficult situation.  Apparently, we will not be able to sit next week, save for Monday, to finish the testimony of FE36.  After that we won't have any witnesses, and we had planned to sit up until the 16th of December.  This is an enormous problem.  
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:
With your leave, Madam President; with your leave, Madam President, if we count working days, and hoping that we will have the full cooperation on the other side from the authorities, we believe that as of the 5th, we will be in a position to bring witnesses from Rwanda.  In the meantime, FE25 will be here. 

I'm sorry, Madam President, NA1 will be here.  That is the first witness to arrive.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, did you have something to say?  
MR. MOSES:
Yes, having discussed the matter with my learned friend, there is also, can I say, potential problem with NA1.  NA1, from our understanding, has to return to where he is living on, I think, the 9th or               10th of December.  If he arrived on the evening of the 1st, which is next Thursday, Your Honours, we are not sitting next Friday.  The following two days of the weekend we have already got the schedule between the 1st and the 9th.  We only have two half days, namely the 7th and 8th.  

I think we are in agreement, my learned friend and I, that the evidence of NA1, it may take the two half days, in fact, even in the evidence-in-chief.  He is a witness from -- if you look at his statement, is someone I think in the pre-trial brief was estimated to have be taking -- two to three days -- or two to three half days, or days for his evidence.  So I think it is unrealistic, to be blunt, that that witness will be concluded in two half days; whether WVSS wants to bring -- it is a matter, obviously, for my learned friend.  He may wish to comment in respect of that, but it seems there could be difficulty in concluding that witness's testimony.  And I think it is nigh on impossible that that witness will be concluded in two and a half days.  

My learned friend may wish to comment on that, but that would be my indication, and I think it is best that we give those indications to Your Honours and to WVSS now, instead of when the witness arrives and says, I have to go.  We get into the situation that we have now, with witnesses needing to leave and in a hurry.  So, I wanted to bring that to your attention, and you may want to hear from Mr. Monthé, but I think we are in agreement that witness would not be concluded in two half days. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank the prosecutor.  

Mr. Monthé, can you give us some information concerning Witness NA1?  He is arriving on the           1st of December and he has to go back by the 9th; that is correct?  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, he is not going back on the 9th.  He is going back on the 10th.  This witness has said, from a long time ago, I have repeated this and I have shouted this in all languages.  It is only in Babalakie (phonetic) that I didn't speak, that this person could only in stay in Arusha for ten days.  It so happens that this witness is coming here for our trial and for Military I.  So I cannot, Madam President, go beyond the availability of someone who is coming here in order to testify on his own will.  It is imperative that this -- this timeframe be respected; and Mr. Essombe knows this.  We are taking this witness in the timeframe that has been indicated to us.  We have no choice.  We have been told when he is coming and when he is going, and we can't go anything else.  Even yesterday, he said that if he doesn't leave here by the 10th, he will not come.  So that is a situation, Madam President.  

And this is something that we have said right from the beginning, and for this witness and Witness PA1.  And that is why PA1 is not here.  We are speaking about NA1, but I'm saying that the same applies to PA1; and that is why he has not been able to come. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, NA1 should appear in the Military I trial; what dates, do you have the dates for that trial?  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President.  My learned friend, Mr. Ogetto, who is responsible for the witness, and he is representing Nsengiyumva, the accused.  And since we are not sitting on the 5th and the 6th, he will take him for those days, and I will take the witness back from the 7th, because we have priority.  But now I understand that the Prosecutor is pre-occupied and I agree that his pre-occupation is justified.  This is an essential witness, and we cannot have him not say what he has experienced.  So we will have a certain amount of the time available.  But I cannot estimate correctly how much time we will need with him, because it will depend on his answers.  
The Prosecutor wanted to talk to me about this.  And I explained to him what I was going to say to you.  And I don't know how much time the Prosecutor will take, but I know how much time I will need because he was there; and you also know that there is the Kibuye trial in which he is involved.  So this will take us all a certain amount of time, Madam President, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So, if he is coming to testify, we need to take the time necessary.  If on the 5th and 6th, he is going to testify in Military I, we can only take him from the 7th and the 8th; and you know that the 9th is a holiday.  So if he needs to go back already by the 10th, this going to cause problems, unless you are able to examine him and cross-examine him on the 7th and the 8th December; that is only solution. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All of this is very unfortunate, but we shall endeavour, where we are, to find a solution which would provide a little more time.  But we would have to negotiation for that, especially with regard to witness NA1.

Now, we would require that order to be issued.  So if you have a reply today, you need to immediately inform the trial coordinator so that the order can be signed today by the judges.  This would enable us to initiate that process or procedure, which, according to your information, takes the minimum of        five working days.  So, we will try and organise ourselves and we will inform you as to how the follow-up of this matter appears to be -- appears to us.

1130H
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I thought I heard the Chamber mention the date of the 16th December.  I already have said on behalf of the Defence that I will not be able to be present on the 16th of December.  During our informal meeting I have said this, and I also mentioned this to the Prosecutor, that the 16th of December I have to be at home and for reasons I have explained to the Chamber.  I am here from the 5th of October without taking into account the fact that I had come here earlier, and I cannot be present here on the 16th of December.  I'm saying this so that no one is taken by surprise. 

I have mentioned this to the Prosecutor, and I think he also has the same concerns as I do for the 16th of December.  I'm saying this to the Chamber so that we are all in the clear about this matter.  I thank you one and all. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Monthé.  But if you cannot be here, maybe Mr. Nekuie can remain with us until the 16th of December.  If we begin with a witness which we will not have completed with, it would be a good idea, at least, for us to be able to sit up to Friday in order to conclude with that witness. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, Mr. Nekuie is old enough to tell you what he intends to do, but I will not be there on the 16th of December, and I believe that the Chamber will recognise that I will have said enough in this case, and I cannot change my schedule because this has made me suffer a great deal since I have been here.  So I will leave the floor to Mr. Nekuie for him to say what he needs to say.  I think he also has some concerns, but I will leave the floor to him. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Mr. Monthé, Your Honours.  It is unfortunate I am also unable to be in Arusha on that date of the 16th December.  Because it does appear that a case within which I am dealing with in Cameroon, dealing with the release of a client, I have already taken obligations, and I will not be able to be present because I have to be there to defend the other client.  I had committed myself to the judges of that other trial, and I cannot possibly see how I would be able to negotiate that situation. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Nekuie.  I am now turning to the Prosecutor.  Do you have the same problem as regards the 16th of December, according to what Mr. Monthé has said to us?  
MR. MOSES:
I personally do, Your Honours, but we would ensure that someone was here on behalf of the Prosecutor, if there was a sitting on the 16th.  We would ensure that there was someone representing the Prosecutor here.  But from a personal point of view, I do, but that doesn't prevent someone else from the Prosecutor's office representing us. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  I think now we have dealt with all the issues, we have all the information we require, I believe we can have the witness ushered back in for the continuation of the proceedings, in other words, the cross-examination.  

Thank you, Registry.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
For the record, all that has been said since we resumed the proceedings after the break was for an open session.  Now we are moving into a closed session.  Madam Prosecutor, the questions that you have, do you want to have them in open session or closed session?  
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, what I will do is, I propose to start in open session.  I don't wish to start in closed session and then there may be questions that will require a closed session, and then we will have to return to closed session.  So I will ask as many questions as I can in open session, so that when I ask for the closed session, it will be all the questions that I have in closed session to make this issue run smoother.  So I will begin in open session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objection from the Defence?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
No objection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  So we shall be sitting in an open session to begin with. 

Madam Prosecutor, you may proceed with the cross-examination of this witness, Witness BR1. 
MS. ALEXIS:
I am obliged to you, Madam President, Your Honours. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, I will remind you that we are in open session.  I am going to ask you some general questions, and my apologies, good day, Witness.  You said that in Nyange there were two schools, Nyange A and Nyange B.  Do I understand you that these were primary schools? 
A.	They were two primary schools which went from year 1 to year 8. 
Q.	And isn't it a fact, Witness, that both these two primary schools were church schools affiliated to the Roman Catholic Church? 
A.	These two churches were under the control of the Catholic Church -- two schools, I beg your pardon. 
Q.	And isn't it true, Witness, that the church, that is specifically the Catholic church, with respect to both Nyange A and Nyange B, paid the salaries of the teachers? 
A.	All the teachers were paid by the government. 
Q.	I am suggesting to you, Witness, that materials was (sic) provided by the church; what do you have to say in response to that, that is, teaching materials? 
A.	Most of the equipment was supplied by the government, and the peoples (sic) bought others supplies -- other supplies.  If the church were to have supplied the equipment, it had to go through the government; in other words, through the inspectors, the education inspectors, and the headmasters. 
Q.	However, Witness, you would agree with me that even if, according to you, the church had to go through school officials, that the church, that is the Catholic Church, did at various points provide both at Nyange A and Nyange B with materials; isn't that so, Witness? 
A.	During the time************************************, I never saw anyone from the parish supply equipment.  If there was any materials to be received, we would take them -- ************************************, ************************ to collect them.  At any rate, teachers did not know who had provided the material, be it the government or the church. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  In any event, Witness, isn't it true that -- and can you confirm, that those two schools fell under the authority of the Catholic Church? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness has already answered that question.  She said that both of the schools were under the Catholic Church.  So could you please move on to the next question, Madam Prosecutor?  
MS. ALEXIS:
Very well, Madam President. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, you spoke of Fathers Seromba and Straton at great length, and I now wish to ask you questions in relation to this matter.  Isn't it true, Witness, that Father Straton left, as a matter of fact fled, Nyange in March 1994? 
A.	Each time I went to the parish I didn't see him there.  I didn't see Father Straton there, but I do not know whether he had fled or not.  Sometimes the peoples would go on holiday -- the priests would go on holiday, and I wouldn't have known whether he had fled.  Maybe he had fled, given that there was a conflict between them, but I wouldn't have been aware. 
Q.	Did you first notice that Father Straton was not there when you went to Nyange in March 1994? 
A.	I never became aware of his presence or absence.  What I know is that the priests would relay with one another when they were dealing with a Mass.  You could go there and there would be one priest saying Mass, and then you would go there at another time and another priest would be saying Mass.  I never wondered why he was absent. 
Q.	In April 1994, Witness, would you agree with me that whenever you went to Mass at Nyange, before or even after the destruction of the church, that you never saw Father Straton? 
A.	I never saw him. 
Q.	As a matter of fact, Witness, would you confirm that, according to your evidence, the only priest you saw celebrating Mass in April 1994 at Nyange was the Accused, Athanase Seromba? 
A.	The Masses that I attended before the destruction of the presidential plane were said by Father Seromba.  Maybe there were other Mass services which were said by other priests in my absence. 
Q.	After the destruction of the presidential plane, did you go to Mass? 
A.	Yes, about twice.  I went to one Mass on a Sunday, and I attended another Mass on the 11th. 
Q.	Therefore, Witness -- I'm trying to understand your evidence -- did you go to Mass on the 10th and 11th of April 1994? 
A.	I attended those two Mass services.  If I am not mistaken, I believe the 10th was a Sunday, and it was rare for me to miss Mass on Sundays. 
Q.	The Mass you attended on the 10th of April 1994, was Athanase Seromba, the priest, celebrating that Mass? 
A.	Yes.  He was the one. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us, if you recall, what time did you go to Mass?  What hour Mass was it that you went to on the 10th of April?
A.	The Mass began after 10 a.m., so I attended the second Mass. 
Q.	When you attended that second Mass, did you see any other members of the clergy, apart from Athanase Seromba? 
A.	What I know is that after the president's plane crashed, there were other priests, including, for instance, Father Balthazar. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness, but perhaps I can restate my question.  My question was this:   On the 10th of April 1994, when you went to that Mass, did you personally see any other members of the clergy, apart from Athanase Seromba? 
A.	I didn't see any other priest on the 10th.  I only saw Father Seromba.  But I heard it said that Father Balthazar was also present at the parish.  I do not know whether those who made that claim were speaking the truth or not. 
Q.	Does that evidence hold as well for the 11th of April; that is, that the only member of the clergy that you saw was Athanase Seromba? 
A.	At the end of the Mass I left, together with Father Seromba, and we went to a place where he made a telephone call, and I didn't see any other priest there. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you attend Mass in the -- in a building at the parish after the destruction of the church? 
A.	After the church was destroyed, we would attend Mass during the weekdays in a building which was said belonged to Shimte (phonetic), but Sunday Masses were held in the Jubilee square. 
Q.	After the destruction of the church, and still in April 1994, how many Masses, approximately, did you attend, either on a weekday or a Sunday.  Generally, how many Masses did you attend? 
A.	I don't know whether you are asking me the number of Masses that were celebrated in April, or whether you're referring to Masses celebrated when I was in Rwanda. 
Q.	I'm speaking specifically of April.  From the time or the date when the church was destroyed until the end of April 1994, approximately how many Masses did you attend -- you attend, yourself? 
A.	I no longer attended Masses, but I attended Masses later on in the month of May. 
Q.	When you attended Masses in the month of May, can you confirm that it was Athanase Seromba who celebrated -- who was the priest who celebrated those Masses? 
A.	When I was attending Mass, the priests would come one after another -- would take it in turns.  There was Father Seromba, then there was Father Nturiye, and Father Kayiranga.  I even saw Father Balthazar. 
Q.	Witness, I'm suggesting to you that the problems -- well, before I move on to that question, you spoke of when, according to you, Father Straton said that Father Seromba had left and that he did not know where he had gone.  My question is this:   On the return of Father Seromba, did you hear Father Seromba say that Father Straton was speaking in the language of the Inkotanyi? 
A.	I never heard Father Seromba say any such thing. 
Q.	But you would agree with me, Witness, that from your evidence, Father Seromba was a priest to whom you were close? 
A.	Yes.  That's quite true, because after having lost my husband, Father Seromba was among those who would listen to me and help me when I asked him for help.  When I did so, he would comply. 
Q.	So am I to understand, Witness, that Father Seromba was a priest to whom you felt loyalty and trust; is that so, Witness? 
A.	Given what I saw of him, I held him in high esteem, and I shared my problems with him. 
Q.	And in your personal experience of Athanase Seromba as a priest, when he gave instructions to you personally, because you liked him, you felt that it was proper to follow those instructions; isn't that so, Witness? 
A.	I don't know where you're getting to, because I didn't quite understand the meaning of your question.  You were speaking about liking, and I do not really understand what you mean.  I considered Father Seromba as a priest, and it was custom in our country to console people who had lost their kith and kin, and he did the same. 
Q.	My question to you is this, Witness:   You've given evidence that Father Seromba was a priest, and I'm not suggesting anything untoward, Witness.  You have given evidence that, as a priest, you felt loyalty and trust for Father Seromba.  My question to you is this:   Since you felt this loyalty and trust to Father Seromba, was that relationship -- and I do not mean an improper relationship -- was that relationship such that, if he asked you to do something, that you would comply? 
A.	I often asked him for advice in relation to prayers.  He often would tell me that I should put myself in the hand of God, and he would say that God would help me.  That is how he gave me advice. 
Q.	According to you, Witness, Athanase Seromba was a priest who, in fact, though he was at Nyange parish from 1993, he was very well liked by the community; isn't that so, Witness? 
A.	Father Seromba was liked by the faithful in Nyange, but mostly because the believers had discovered the bad behaviour of Father Straton.  And when there was a new priest, the faithful would trust the new priest who had come to Nyange. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, would you agree with me generally in Rwandese culture that priests were well respected; would you agree with that statement? 
A.	Yes.  Christians respected priests.  Nonetheless, rogues or delinquents could feel scorn for priests who are integral persons like these ones, those priests.  Let me add that those who did not believe in the Catholic Church did not see Father -- did not look upon Father Seromba kindly. 
Q.	Witness, a witness who came to give evidence here on behalf of Father Seromba gave evidence that approximately 85 percent of Kivumu commune was Roman Catholic; do you agree with that estimation? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness's microphone has been turned off. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, your microphone is turned off. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could you kindly repeat your answer?  We didn't hear it, Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  In our commune, most people were Catholics.  I've never tried to figure out the percentages though.  I don't have the statistics. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Another witness who came to give evidence for Father Seromba said that generally in Rwandese culture, priests were obeyed.  Do you agree with that, Witness?  I'm speaking about generally.  
A.	I believe I answered that type of question just a few seconds ago. 
Q.	I have asked you, Witness, if priests were respected.  Now I'm putting a different proposition to you.  I am telling you, Witness, that a witness who gave evidence in this trial for Athanase Seromba said that, in Rwandese culture, priests were generally obeyed.  It's a different matter, Witness, and if you can, can you answer it? 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Objection, Madam President.  (No interpretation)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
There is a problem with the interpretation booth.  We are listening to this in Kinyarwanda, and not in French. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The English interpreter was also hearing Kinyarwandan and could not interpret. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Monthé?
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, Madam President.  I object.  The witness has already answered the question put to her by the Prosecutor.  She said that, indeed, in Rwanda, priests were respected by believers, but that thugs or rogues, criminals, did not respect priests or other people of integrity.  The Prosecutor is, in essence, asking the same question which has already been answered by the witness.  I would kindly request the Chamber to ask the Prosecutor to rephrase her question. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, the issue is related, but it is my submission that it is not the same issue.  Someone can be well-respected and not obeyed.  And, further, I am pulling (sic) evidence that has been given from Defence witnesses.  So this is the case for the Defence, and I am merely suggesting it without getting into any details which would breach witness protection orders, but I am suggesting to this witness what other witnesses said to see if this witness can confirm or not.  It is not a complicated question, and neither is it a trick question.  It's a simple question, and I'm certain that the witness is well able to respond and understand the difference, and the nuances of differences between the two questions. 
THE WITNESS:
Everyone has their own opinion, in my view.  Perhaps that's how that witness saw the matter.  I think that priests were obeyed, but there were criminals and thugs who didn't respect them.  Perhaps people from other denominations wouldn't respect Catholic priests.  So I hope that is a satisfactory answer for you, Madam President. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	It is indeed, Witness, thank you.  Witness, as well, with respect to the relationship between Fathers Seromba and Straton, a witness who gave evidence for Athanase Seromba said that Father Straton supplied goods from CARITAS to Inkotanyi in Ruhango, and he suggested that this was the cause of the difficulty between Fathers Seromba and Straton.  Did you ever hear of this?  
A.	With regard to the distribution of supplies he gave to the Inkotanyi, Inkotanyi didn't take the supplies.  The supplies were simply given to people who didn't deserve them.  They were distributed to friends of Father Straton.  One day I saw a vehicle come by very close to where we were.  It allegedly had taken supplies from CARITAS. 
Q.	Witness, can you confirm that it was your evidence that, when you speak of Inkotanyi, you're speaking of Tutsis? 
A.	No.  Personally, when I'm talking about Inkotanyi, I'm not speaking about Tutsis.  When I say "Inkotanyi", I mean people who had attacked Rwanda.  Tutsis are Tutsis; Inkotanyi are those who attacked Rwanda. 
Q.	Would you agree with me, Witness, that these people who had attacked Rwanda, who were the RPF, that the RPF was made up mostly of Tutsis? 
A.	That's public knowledge.  Most RPF attackers were Tutsis. 
Q.	Witness, tell me if I am wrong in my understanding, therefore, of your evidence.  Is it your evidence that Father Straton gave goods from CARITAS to undeserving people, and that these undeserving people were Tutsis; is that your evidence? 
A.	I never said that the vulnerable people were Tutsis.  I said that the supplies were supposed to go to vulnerable people.  I didn't make any ethnic distinction.  During the distribution I said that Straton gave the supplies to his friends.  They were not vulnerable people. 
Q.	Did you ever hear, Witness, that according to you, these friends of Father Straton, that they were Tutsis? 
A.	Some of his friends were Tutsis. 
Q.	Are you Hutu, Witness? 
A.	I don't believe it's necessary for me to tell you which ethnic group I belong to.  If that's of some importance to you, please tell me. 
Q.	Are you Hutu, Witness? 
A.	I belong to the Tutsi (sic) ethnic group.  Let me repeat:   I am a member of the Hutu ethnic group. 
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  According to you, Witness, Father Straton knew that Father Seromba had gone to Ruhengeri; wasn't that your evidence? 
A.	I can confirm, Straton knew that he left to Ruhengeri.  He went there for a Catholic church meeting.  He was sent by the parish.  He wasn't alone.  There were two who went there.  They were sent by the parish.  Straton knew that full well.  It's unfortunate to see that Father Straton spoke poorly of his colleague in public like that. 
Q.	Is it your belief, Witness, that priests should not share personal and private information about other priests with mere parishioners? 
A.	In my opinion, a clergy member or a priest, when they speak about one of their colleagues, may say things to other clergy colleagues, but they should not say things about their colleagues in public at Mass.  They shouldn't try to tarnish the interpretation of a -- the reputation, rather, of others, and the reputation of the church.  

	Let me give you an example.  If I'm teaching, I have a conflict with a colleague, I won't go before my students and talk about that conflict.  Maybe we had a fight in a bar.  Would I talk about that in front of my students?  Here in the Tribunal, say an employee has another problem with a staff member; they have a fight.  Can one talk about that fight in public?  Can he talk about his colleague like that?  I don't think so.  Pardon me for using an example with regard to the Tribunal, but that's the only kind of example I could come up with. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Thank you.  However, isn't it your evidence that when Father Seromba received this leaflet, even if other priests were present, *************************************** this information? 
A.	And yet the pamphlet doesn't have anything to do with the colleague.  ***************************** during unsafe times.  I was shown the pamphlet.  I saw it. 
Q.	Witness, in any event, whether it was Father Seromba at fault or Father Straton at fault, you would agree with me that there was tension between Fathers Seromba and Straton.  They were not getting along; yes or no?  Do you agree with that proposition? 
A.	The relationship between the two was tense.  That is true. 
Q.	Therefore, Witness, since you agree with me that the relationship between the two was tense, you don't know if Father Seromba told Father Straton where he was going, how long he was going for, or when he was coming back, don't you? 
A.	I'm well informed.  Before they went to a meeting, we were informed there was a meeting in Ruhengeri.  We knew that.  Other parishes sent delegates to that meeting and I was informed. 
Q.	And were you informed by your friend, Athanase Seromba? 
A.	No.  He was not the one who said he was going to the meeting.  Father Straton was informed of the meeting.  That's what I'm saying.  When there was a meeting or if the priest had to go on mission somewhere, people were informed.  They knew.  It wasn't the priest himself who told me, but we knew. 
Q.	Did someone named Agnes also go to that meeting? 
A.	Agnes Maria -- I remember her first name, Agnes, but the last name, I think it's Mujawamariya.  She's a teacher, I know that, and she did go with him to that very same meeting. 
Q.	And was Agnes someone who was divorced, whose husband -- well, ex-husband worked with CARITAS? 
A.	Agnes didn't work at CARITAS. 
Q.	I'm sorry, Witness.  Perhaps my question wasn't clear.  What I asked you was this:   Did Agnes's ex-husband work for CARITAS, not Agnes herself? 
A.	I'm not understanding.  Whose husband -- CARITAS?  Can you repeat the question for me?  I'm sorry. 
Q.	No problem, Witness.  I'm asking you a very simple question.  This Agnes Mujawamariya who you knew, did her husband, or her ex-husband, I think, did he work for CARITAS? 
A.	Here's what I know:   Her husband was a medical assistant, but for the rest, I don't know. 
Q.	Were you a member of the parish council of that church? 
A.	No.  I was an ordinary believer.  I went to Mass on a regular basis, but I was never a member of the parish council. 
Q.	Did you hear, Witness, that after Father Seromba and Agnes returned from that meeting, that Agnes -- sorry, that Agnes said that Father Seromba was going to break up the Akazu of Father Straton? 
A.	I never heard that.  Never. 
Q.	Witness, let's talk about this pamphlet or this leaflet that you spoke of.  Is it your evidence that when Athanase Seromba showed this leaflet to you, that no one else was present? 
A.	Yes.  There were two of us.  I needed to speak to him.  He told me that we could talk about it after dealing with an urgent matter that had to be dealt with immediately.  He told me to wait for us to be able to talk about it. 
Q.	And when, according to you, Father Seromba had to go and make this phone call, it was inside the presbytery, isn't that so, Witness? 
A.	That's correct.  He phoned from the presbytery building. 
Q.	And during his phone -- 
MS. ALEXIS:
My apologies, Your Honours.
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Yes, Witness.  During that phone conversation between a priest and the bishop, you were present; isn't that so, Witness? 
A.	I was there.  I've already told you that. 
Q.	Witness, without mentioning any names -- we will get to a closed session eventually in which we will be more particular as to names -- would you agree with me that, from what you had learned, some educated Tutsis were evacuated to the parish? 
A.	There were some Tutsis who went to the parish.  I gave you the name of one person who told me that he had been evacuated.  If we look at that example, some people were evacuated, if, indeed, the information I received is genuine. 
Q.	And this -- sorry, Witness.  
A.	Personally, I never saw that evacuation or transfer of persons.  I'm simply basing myself on the information I received, and I conclude that certain people were evacuated.  In the case that information is incorrect, my conclusion, therefore, would also be incorrect. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  But according to your information, the persons who were being -- who were being evacuated to the parish were Tutsi intellectuals; isn't that so? 
A.	As I have already said, I'd talk about that person's responsibility or duties, the person I spoke with.  It's clear, you can't have such duties if you're not an intellectual. 
Q.	Witness, did you ever find out who were the authorities who were evacuating, or who were proposing an evacuation of some Tutsi intellectuals? 
A.	In fact, the person I spoke with said the communal officials evacuated them.  According to the information I obtained later about the death of some people, I learned that anyone who wanted to be evacuated was evacuated.  According to the information I received later, it was not simply the Tutsi intellectuals who were.  Anyone who wanted to be evacuated, was. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  But the particular Tutsi intellectual with whom you spoke, did this person tell you the names of the communal authorities involved in the evacuation? 
A.	He didn't give me any names.  He simply told me, and he was to be evacuated in a communal vehicle. 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, when you gave the -- well, can you give us the date, approximately, on which you gave the gendarmes (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal)? 
A.	I brought them those (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) on the 14th of April 1994. 
Q.	And even if it was a long time ago, can you tell us, Witness, did you take a lot of (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal)?  Did you take (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal)?  Approximately how many (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal) did you take to the gendarmes? 
A.	Forgive me.  I think these questions are of a nature that they may reveal my identity.  Perhaps we can stop with these types of questions and wait until we go to a closed session.  
      (Pages 25 to 35 by Jennifer Spring)






























MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let it be expunged from the record, the fact that the witness said she (By order of the Court, this portion of the evidence has been extracted and filed under seal).  That should be expunged from the record.  

Madam President -- Madam Prosecutor, we are dealing here with a protected witness, and you must pay attention. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Very well, Madam President.  I will shift those series of questions to the closed session.  
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, on the 15th of April 1994, you attended the burial -- you were one of the many people who attended the burial of Dr. Juvénal; isn't that so? 
A.	That's correct.  I was there for his burial.  That's correct.  I've said that. 
Q.	And you did not return to your native commune on the day of the burial until late evening or night; isn't that so? 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, Your Honour? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Monthé? 
MR. MONTHÉ:
I believe that it may be time for the Prosecutor to ask for a closed session for this witness.  We are running into some problems.  These types of questions really should be put to the witness in a closed session.  I don't have any objection with regard to the questions, but when we start talking about the funeral and the commune, I start to be concerned, Madam President. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, I've been trying to be careful.  I did not ask the witness which was her cellule.  A commune is a fairly large geographical area.  I'm not asking the witness particular questions, but I have no objections, if it would make Defence counsel feel more comfortable, with going into closed session.  And if the Court so rules, of course, I have no difficulties in going into closed session, Madam President.  But I can proceed for a bit more in open session, but I'm in Your Lordship's hands.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, do you have any problem with that particular question?  Do you think that you can answer it without giving information about your identity?  And, if so, please answer the question; otherwise, reserve your answer for a later stage when we'll be in closed session.  
THE WITNESS:
*************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************.  I am ready to proceed, but, with your leave, I prefer to go into closed session, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, do you have questions for the witness that are not at all of a nature to disclose the witness's identity?  And, if so, deal with those matters now.  We will be very vigilant.  Is it possible, Madam Prosecutor? 
MS. ALEXIS:
I had thought so, Madam President, but the witness, it appears to me, is not at all comfortable.  And if it would facilitate matters, then perhaps at this moment we can go into closed session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  As the parties prefer a closed session, we are going to move into one.  

We apologise for any inconvenience caused to the public.  We have to go into a closed session for the protection of this witness and in the interests of justice. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 38 to 46] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
