MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber is now in session.  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  Registry, could you kindly announce the matter before us.
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Vaz presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, 10 May 2005, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor v. Seromba, Case No. ICTR-01-66-T.

Thank you, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, registry.

We now should ask the parties to introduce themselves, beginning with the Prosecution.  Do you have a problem?
MS. ARBIA:
No, it is okay for me, but I see that there is a problem with my colleague's headset.  Please pardon me, one moment.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, go ahead, Madam Prosecutor.
MS. ARBIA:
Good morning, Your Honours.  On behalf of the Prosecutor appears myself, Silvana Arbia, Jonathan Moses, and we are assisted by Tolulope Olowoye, case manager.  Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecutor.

We now ask the Defence to introduce themselves.  Yes, Mr. Pognon, you have the floor.
MR. POGNON:
Alfred Pognon, former bâtonnier, counsel.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you alone for your team, Mr. Pognon?
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, Patrice Monthé has indicated that he will not be here today.  He will be here on about the 12th, according to the last message I had from him on Friday.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Has he indicated the reasons for his absence today?
MR. POGNON:
He said that that there were professional matters that he had to attend to.
THE ACCUSED:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, the Accused Seromba wishes to take the floor.  One moment, Mr. Seromba.

Any objections from the Prosecution?  The Accused wishes to address the Chamber.
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, Mr. Pognon has indicated why his co-counsel is not here today.  I don't see at this stage why we shouldn't object to the Accused taking the floor.  As such, we object.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Pognon, do you have any objection to the Accused being heard by the Chamber?
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I've always believed that the Accused should have a full and entire defence so, no, I would not object to him taking the floor.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you.  We now give the floor to the Accused Seromba.
THE ACCUSED:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, because I do not have counsel, I wrote a letter to you saying that I could not be here today in court.  But out of respect for the Chamber and for the Judges, I came to explain my problems to you so you can take measures to safeguard my rights.  Here is the letter that I wrote to you.

"To Andrésia Vaz, Presiding Judge, Trial Chamber III.  Subject: Resumption of trial in May 2005.

"Madam President, in this letter I have an opportunity to tell your Chamber that I may not come to trial on 10 May 2005 to resume my trial because I have no indication about the intentions of Mr. Alfred Pognon, who has stopped all of the defence work in my case since January 2005.  I would like to draw the attention of your Chamber to the content of my letter addressed to Mr. Pognon in April 2005 and his response dated 18 April 2005.  Mr. Pognon officially notified me that he would be leaving my case:  'I have noted that, under Article 19(A) of the Statute, that I am no longer your counsel.  I accept that I'm no longer your counsel and that as of 18th April 2005 I no longer represent nor do I assist you.'"

"Now, I have not had any contact with Mr. Pognon since January 2005 so that I don't see how I can trust in his counsel in presenting my defence case.  In my April (sic) of 29th April 2005, I clearly opposed unsigned documents that were tendered with the registry by Mr. Pognon, at a
time when he had already withdrawn from my case and already notified the Chamber and the Registry and myself of his intention to leave the case in his letter of 18 April 2005.  Madam President, nor am I informed of the intention of Patrice Monthé, my co-counsel, even though he was informed of the chaotic situation I have been in for some months.

"Madam President, I am asking you to take measures to safeguard my rights as guaranteed by Article 24(b) of the ICTR Statute.  Thank you, Madam President.  Sincerely."

Thank you, Madam President, and the only reason I came this morning is, indeed, to indicate that I do not have counsel.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We have heard the Accused Seromba.

Mr. Pognon, do you have any remarks to make at this stage?  Yes, you have the floor.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, from the very beginning, I would like to thank the Accused for confirming here before us now that, upon his request -- his request, I accepted to withdraw from his case, and today my relationship with him does not allow me to consider myself his counsel.  I am before the Tribunal, and the tradition says that I should be able to express or respond to what he has just said.

The Registry received his letter and asked me for an explanation.  I told the Registry that, as counsel, I have nothing to say to the registry, and that I would respond before the Tribunal, or before the order of council in Benin, with regard to the faults, perhaps, I have made in respect to his case.  I am no superman.

Now, I can say and explain what the situation is.  Everything else is something that is between the client and counsel; it's privileged.  The Accused has just taken the floor.  He spoke of a date, 31 December.  He also mentioned another date.  He mentions January.  These are the dates that, for him -- according to him, his case was no longer going forward.  December -- 31st December, I received a letter which was a response, a direct one from the Accused, to a letter that I wrote to Patrice Monthé, my co-counsel.  In working with my co-counsel, it appeared to me that certain things did not seem to move as I would have liked them to as lead counsel.  We were in trial in September and in October for the first Prosecution witnesses and I did not appreciate my co-counsel's method of cross-examining, not that I'm some kind of master cross-examiner, but cross-examination does require certain things.  We spoke about this.  He poorly received what I told him, very poorly received that, and, as such, there was a rift between us.

You will remember that in January we had four last Prosecution witnesses.  I wrote to my co-counsel to tell him and, furthermore, he is very busy at home, and I said, "As you are very busy, if you want I will deal with the last four Prosecution witnesses; I will cross-examine them."  When the time comes, we must say -- tell things as they are.

At that point in time, co-counsel wrote a letter on 31st December opposing the fact that I could cross-examine those four Prosecution witnesses, me, Alfred Pognon, who has been counsel for years.  The Accused said, "No, you will not cross-examine those four, witnesses; Patrice Monthé absolutely must cross-examine them."  When I met him in the detention facility, he even went as far as to tell me that, "If Patrice Monthé does not cross-examine them, I will not come to trial."  I didn't dare to tell him that he was the one in prison -- in detention, not me.  Nevertheless, I came here.

The Accused wants this work to be divided up, and not me to cross-examine the four witnesses.  I arrived.  The Prosecution reduced its list to three, instead of four witnesses, and so I told my co-counsel, "Go ahead cross-examine the first witness.  I will deal with the second one; the third is for you.  We will switch off like that."  He said, "No; go ahead, continue", and so we did.

That hearing ended.  The Prosecution finished with the presentation of its case and witnesses and, from what I remember, the Accused was satisfied with the way things ended.  I remember during our last status conference there was an issue of resuming on the 1st of March.  Of course, we had very strong debate between the Prosecution and the Defence.  It was all fair.  But, to be honest, we weren't ready; we really weren't ready, and, thank God, the WVSS supported us when it came here to say, "This is when we can present the witnesses.  They need so much time for their travel documents and, as such, 1st March could not be possible."  We weren't ready and we hadn't even finished investigating the witnesses in Rwanda.  Our assistant had to return to Rwanda to meet with those witnesses.  We weren't ready, to such an extent that we hadn't received some documents; there was a document from - chapeau de roue, and we needed that document whilst Prosecution witnesses were still testifying.

In this Tribunal's tradition, witnesses are extremely important because the -- Prosecution witnesses are extremely important because the Prosecution has to charge the Accused.  We weren't ready.  We discussed with the Accused.  We agreed that we needed until May.  Perhaps he remembers this; perhaps not.  Sometimes it seems like there is amnesia, but we said we need at least until May; yes, we need that time, indeed.
We started to work.  There were some motions that we still had yet to file at the time.  There was a document regarding the witnesses; how do we say?  It was a file -- I remember it, but I don't remember what it was called -- a very important file regarding some allegations regarding the United Nations investigations, 450 pages, that we needed to receive.  We had to wait for those before we could begin to work on them.  We began to work from January until now.

My co-counsel was dealing with witnesses from the (By order of the Court, this word was extracted and filed under seal).  At that time he still had not given the documents regarding those witnesses.  He still hadn't sent his notes taken in (By order of the Court, this word was extracted and filed under seal).  He still had to go back to (By order of the Court, this word was extracted and filed under seal) a second time.  He did so.  But at the time he had not yet done that.  As such, we were not prepared.

When 1st March came around, strong debate within the Tribunal; the problem was laid out.  I filed a motion for an extension of time limit.  In the same motion, I asked for a few documents that Prosecution had not yet disclosed.  In the meantime, as that motion was pending, my co-counsel, Patrice Monthé, told me that trial would resume on 4th April.  To me, we would still not be ready for the 4th of April.  Our assistant still had not gone to (By order of the Court, this word was extracted and filed under seal), and the documents that we asked for, we still had not received them.

I filed a second motion for extension of time limit.  There were objections to the effect that I had to appeal and that the decision was definitive.  I gave my professional opinion on that point of view.  And we were not ready on the 4th of April.  I wrote to the President of the Tribunal saying that I could not come to trial if I was not prepared.  The documents finally came in and we began to work.  We began to write our pre-defence brief and to do everything that we needed to under Rule 73 ter.

Then came the 5th of April.  A few days before that, the Tribunal advised me that the hearing for 4th of April would be, indeed, a status conference.  I had to be in my office ready to have that status conference over the telephone.  I asked my co-counsel to be present as I was very busy in my office back home.  Co-counsel was here.

We had the status conference and it was agreed trial would resume on this day.  I was asked if I would be ready and I said, yes, I would be ready -- we will be ready.  Why do I say "we"?  We met with the few witnesses.  We heard them.  We know that a working session with the Accused would be enough to accomplish a few things.  The Accused has documents that he must give us.  We knew that the assistant, upon her return from Rwanda, had to meet with the Accused and take those documents.  And we would take them to build a case.

As counsel, there is a certain number of things that I have to do and I don't need, necessarily, to be with the Accused to do them.  So I was waiting for those documents.  And during the hearing of the 5th of April we said that we would be ready for today.

Madam President, Your Honours, Mr. (sic) Prosecutor, Madam Prosecutor, we are ready today.  Simply, the Accused does not want things to begin today.  Let's take the date of 5th of April.  There was the status conference via telephone.  It was 2 p.m. or perhaps noon in Benin.  I was with my wife at the table.  The Accused called.  It was the 6th of April when he telephoned me.  "Yes, yes, it was yesterday", I said.  He said that he was satisfied with the result of the status conference, via telephone.  And he wanted to be sure that we, indeed, would be ready for the 10th of May.  I confirmed that we would, and he told me that he was satisfied.

Then came the 12th of April.  At my home I received a fax.  It was a letter, dated 9th of April, in strange terms and it said that -- the title was "Your disinterest in my trial."  Everyone received that.  I think it's gone throughout the Tribunal.  "Your disinterest in my trial."  Instead of telling me, he said, "Why didn't you show up to such an extent that the Tribunal had to organise a teleconference for the status conference?"  And he said he was fed up with that situation.  He listed certain things, and I consider all that as defamation.  And I drew the conclusion, and told him I wouldn't like to continue to defend him as lead counsel.  The letter is there.

On the 6th of April the Accused called me to congratulate me.  On 10th April I received a letter which had been written three days earlier, and he poured scorn on me.  What do I have to do in view of such a schizophrenic situation?  All I have to say is, "All right, I didn't know I was disinterested in your trial.  Secondly, I take note of the fact that I can no longer defend you in this case and I thank you.  Conclusion: consider that from now, henceforth, I am no longer your counsel."  He was the one who decided and I acquiesced, and I am following this tradition in the profession whereby a relationship between a client and his counsel is like a marriage that has to be renewed every day up to the end of the trial.  It doesn't matter who erred.  The fact of the matter is that there is no confidence.  Whatever the considerations, by the way, which are not such that they cannot be redeemed -- but when you have a problem of confidence, there's nothing you can do.  I answered the letter and I copied all those to whom he had sent a copy of that letter.

On the 15th of April I received another letter wherein the Accused continued insulting me, copying the Registry and informing the Registrar that he should do all he can to ensure that co-counsel should be the person to save the situation -- to rescue the situation, and he said that four times.  As a professional, that is not a manner to conduct a trial, and on -- he said four times, "That is a person who will be my counsel."  He said, "You will have to choose another lawyer so that myself and the co-counsel can rescue the situation."

That was the letter of the 15th April.  I don't know how the Registry received all that, but I got a letter from the Registry, and in that letter I was -- the Registry said, "This cannot go on; your trial has cost so much.  You cannot say that your co-counsel or lead counsel should disqualify himself."  So I was written -- they wrote to me as lead counsel and asked me, "What do you think about this?  Know that you are the officially assigned lead counsel and what the Accused says has nothing to do with us."  I responded to that letter as required by practice in this profession in which I have worked for such a long time, a profession in which I will die.  When I die, I will be buried in my robes in my coffin.  I answered, saying that, "You assigned me to defend the Accused.  If the Accused withdraws his confidence, your assignment collapses; you have to get someone else.  Whatever the case, it is not up to me to defend an accused person who has withdrawn his confidence.  That is clear."  It is not at the end of my career that I will betray my convictions."  That was the response I sent to the Registry, but I told the Chamber that I would be ready on the 5th of April, and I am ready; I am ready vis-à-vis the Tribunal.  I have done what I had to do, in spite of the obstruction of my counsel, of my Accused -- my client.

The notes he brought back from (By order of the Court, this word was extracted and filed under seal) were written so badly they were illegible, and I wrote to him and I told him, "Co-counsel, I cannot read your notes.  Please, have them typed and then send me the summary of those notes."  I phoned him; I wrote to him; I told him all this, but he did not budge.  I had to assign three workers in my chambers to decipher his notes in order to be able to glean the minimum substance from the notes he brought back from (By order of the Court, this word was extracted and filed under seal); that is, that I summarised and sent to the Tribunal.  The co-counsel was acting in connivance with the Accused.  When the Accused is talking of January -- it is in January that the -- I was -- I asked him to give me the file.  He is a traitor -- he is a priest, but he didn't do that.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, please.
MR. POGNON:
I am giving examples, Madam President.  If you want me to explain things, I will.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I wanted to remind you, Counsel, you are right, but he is not there.
MR. POGNON:
I am trying to explain the situation, Madam President.

I'm explaining the situation because it is the last time I am explaining this before this Tribunal.  If the Chamber is not ready to listen to me, I will leave and go back home.  That is clear.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you are right.  Co-counsel was supposed to be there today.  He is not there.  We thought that we should adjourn so that he should be there so that they didn't say, later on, that everything was said in his absence.  We have finally decided to allow you to respond, since the Accused took the floor.  We are simply asking you to refrain from dwelling on what concerns the co-counsel since you will have the opportunity to do so later.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, as a lawyer, I want to state that I will not return to this Chamber in the matter of Father Seromba.  That is clear.  There is a sign -- there are many things, assignment of counsel -- but there is also my liberty and my honour as a lawyer which is jeopardised by the priest, a priest of the Catholic Church who is a priest of my church.  I want to state that I'm not coming back to this Chamber.  That should be clear.  I am doing my work.  If we meet to say that Counsel Pognon didn't act properly, I accept that.  Beyond that, I am doing my work.  I am speaking once and for all.

My story with this priest started since Florence up to this date.  The co-counsel boycotted the preparation of the documents that had to be disclosed on that Rule 13 ter, but -- he has boycotted.  But he did that in connivance with the Accused.  For a long time he has been doing everything to make sure the trial is not expedited, as required by the Tribunal within the Tribunal's time limit, within reasonable time, according to international instruments -- legal instruments.  If I have not submitted documents today under Rule 73 ter, it is because those documents are in the custody of the Accused.

Of course, my assistant returned with some documents, some materials, but these are not essential for this case.  As a matter of fact, if he hadn't stopped me mid-course, I would have come here 10 days earlier and gone through all the work that was done by him.  And I would have agreed on the disclosures we have to make.  As a matter of fact, we disclosed many documents during the Prosecution case.  So, he kept those documents and he did what he wanted to do.  Of course, as you say -- as he says, I do not follow his instructions because he wanted me to call certain persons as witnesses, and I deem that, in view of the status of the case, those witnesses should not be called.  And it is my absolute right, and I learnt this in law school.  I practice this.  I have also taught it to others, that, indeed, the lawyer should be independent with regard to certain issues and vis-à-vis the Accused.  Consequently, I have come because, although -- he said I was disinterested in his case and he has sacked me as his counsel, but I came nonetheless, because I took him from somewhere.  And we are of a confessional tradition.  He cannot say that I do see him -- that I did not go to see him since people have to go and see him to make their confession.  I went to see him.  Yesterday, I was at the detention facility.  I waited for 35 minutes.  The security guard came to tell me that he had refused to see me.  I don't know what I did to him.  I don't know.  That is it.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor, you have the floor.
MS. ARBIA:
Thank you, Madam President.  The Prosecutor does not wish to reiterate all the arguments that were already made during the 5 April status conference.  I wanted us to simply note that the terms of reference given to Counsel Pognon and Co-counsel Monthé are not a private matter between the Accused Seromba and lead Counsel Pognon and Co-counsel Monthé.  Furthermore, the Rules that are binding in various countries are not applicable here.  We should simply refer to Rule 45 ter as far as we are concerned.  I remark on them; that is, Rule 45 ter of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  It is up to the parties to decide when and how to present their case.  We are before an International Tribunal that is governed by a Statute and Rules of Procedure and Evidence, and Directives.  As far as the Accused is concerned, he waited up to the 9th of April to express his discontent, his lack of confidence, his complaints vis-à-vis his counsel.  The date fixed for commencement of the Defence case was changed three times and, today, we are still facing disagreements between the Accused and his counsel, and we are still facing a situation which neither the Accused nor the counsel are presenting a situation -- the circumstances in which the Accused is accusing his counsel and lead counsel is saying, "Today, it's all over."  Rule 44 of Rules of Procedure and Evidence -- very clear.  As far as the Accused is concerned, subparagraph (H) states as follows: Under exceptional circumstances, at the request of the Accused or his counsel, the Accused may assess or consider the situation and rule on -- if exceptional circumstances obtain and assess the circumstances in view of its decisions.

And it states that - Your Honour, we are, therefore, dealing with an assessment which is in the interest of justice.  Only the Chamber is authorised to decide.  Having heard the counsel for the Accused, lead counsel decides unilaterally and spontaneously that, "I am no longer your counsel."  All this is not admitted -- all this is not acceptable.  The Rules are clear.

Regarding the terms of reference the Rules are also very clear.  Rule 44(I) states: "It is understood that Counsel will represent the accused and conduct the case to finality."  This is the obligation of the assigned counsel.  "Failure to do so, absent just cause approved by the Chamber ...," so it is still within the remit of the Chamber to approve or not to approve the reasons given by Defence counsel who presents to the Chamber the circumstances under which he can no longer fulfill his assignment, and I mean lead counsel and co-counsel.

These are covered by the Rules.  They cannot decide, unless their reasons are approved by the Chamber, to put an end to their mandate -- or their assignment.  Your Honours, in the opinion of the Prosecutor, those exceptional circumstances do not exist in this trial.  Accused Seromba informed the Chamber only on the 9th of April that he no longer has confidence in his lead counsel but that he has confidence in the co-counsel, and this is obvious.

So, there are conditions -- the conditions for continuation of this trial obtain.  We cannot leave it to the discretion of the Accused to take measures that obstruct the conduct of this trial.  Accused Seromba has shown proof -- neither shown proof of exceptional circumstances, nor has counsel presented to the Chamber reasons that can be approved, in the opinion of the Prosecutor.

The Accused chose his counsel.  And in the pre-trial phase there were even delays because the counsel chosen by Accused Seromba was not available.  In light of what lead counsel has told us today, Seromba was satisfied with the work, the activities, of his lead counsel up to the 6th of April, and the 6th of April came after the status conference during which the Honourable Judges scheduled the date for commencement of the Defence case, which is today.  And it is still this morning that Accused Seromba refers to other difficulties, saying that he did not have to be here, but that he came to express to the Chamber his excuses and certain circumstances.

The Accused should know, Your Honours -- he is not a lawyer, but he should know this.  He should know it through the instructions and the orders of the Chamber that, here, we are dealing with a trial against Father Seromba, and the trial is conducted according to the Rules laid down in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  The trial was supposed to recommence today.  And, as far as the Prosecution is concerned, it has to start today.  The Accused and his counsel had all the latitude necessary to prepare the Defence case.  They had all the time as well as the means to do so.  All those matters were discussed during the status conference.  There is no further reason why this trial should be delayed.  Pre-trial briefs have been filed.

It is true that the Prosecution has suffered prejudice since personal particulars of the witness have not been provided and the statements of the witnesses that were mentioned on the Defence witness list have not been provided, and all this is in violation of your order of the 13th of April 2005 wherein you gave a time limit up to the 19th of April, by which date the identity and statements of the witnesses had to be filed.  All this has not been received.

But the Prosecutor requests that the trial, at this stage, should continue according to your orders, Your Honours, and in keeping with the interests of justice.  There are witnesses.  There are summary statements of witnesses who have to appear.  All other matters should be kept out of this trial.

The Prosecution has taken all guarantees to make sure the rights of the Accused are defended.  As regards his presence here today, the Accused claims that he doesn't have counsel appearing for him and he cannot appear.  Not only does he have counsel; he has two.  This Tribunal has made provision for both counsel, lead counsel and co-counsel and -- a co-counsel, and according to Rule 45 ter ought to be precedent.  In the opinion of the Prosecutor, his absence is not justified.  And I request the Chamber to take the necessary measures.

Madam President, Your Honours, it is evident that there is an attempt here to delay the proceedings.  There is no reason to replace lead counsel.  There is no justification on the part of counsel that is likely to be approved by the Chamber, no justification why this counsel should not continue defending the Accused Seromba.  I don't want to repeat what was stated, but it is very important.  The Rules are clear, and it would be very easy to leave it at the discretion of the Accused -- the morning which the proceedings should continue, how a Defence case should be presented, and all this would obstruct the work of the Tribunal.  The Judges are there.  All the guarantees have been provided.  The conditions are ripe for this trial to continue.

If Accused Seromba thinks he doesn't have any counsel to defend him and that the trial can no longer continue, that he has no defence case to present, the conclusion would be very simple: we'd have filed a motion to the effect that, in the absence of Defence witnesses, the Tribunal should set a date for closing arguments and completion of this trial.  There is no other solution, Your Honours.  This trial started in September 2004.  The Prosecutor called 15 Prosecution witness and since September -- since January.  September, October, the Prosecution presented its evidence.  The Defence was well aware of the Defence case, and since that date it was in a position to prepare the Defence case.  All the disclosures were made.  Even the documents regarding two priests before the court of appeal in Rwanda, all that has been disclosed.  Only a small portion of the documents in that trial still have to be produced in French.  The Prosecutor has discharged all its obligations and has scrupulously observed all the decisions and orders of the Chamber and, although the Chamber said there were no disclosure obligations, the Prosecutor disclosed all that was requested by the Defence, beyond its obligations under the Rules.

I would like to emphasise, Your Honours, that this trial cannot be delayed.  It is very important, in the interests of justice and, also, in respect of the dignity of the work that all of us are doing, that the Statute and the Rules of the Tribunal have to be observed.  I emphasised this point during the status conference.  Now, it becomes extremely important to demand that all parties respect the Rules of Procedure and Evidence in their entirety and that your orders should also be respected.  How are we to move this trial forward?

I pointed out that the Prosecutor does not have the witnesses' personal particulars, but solutions can be found.  We could start with the first group of witnesses and, perhaps, the Prosecutor will do her best in order to be ready to cross-examine those witnesses, even though their personal particulars may be provided belatedly, but not after 20 -- 21 days of the examination.  So, we shall safeguard the Prosecution rights in each case.

The Prosecutor also commits herself to cross-examine, even although the 21-day time limit may not be respected.  This is very important.  I repeat it because it is very important and I want to repeat it as forcefully as possible.  I want to point out that this trial cannot be discontinued or postponed at the behest of the Accused and his counsel and that no reasons have been given for change of counsel or delay.  I thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you, Madam Prosecutor.  We would now like to have the point of view of the different sections involved in the preparation of the Defence case and their witnesses.  We should also like to hear from the registry; in other words, the person representing the Registrar.  We would like to hear from them because there has been a motion filed by the Accused.  Is the Registry representative here in the courtroom?

Mrs. N'gum, you have the floor.  Could you kindly give us a summary of the situation?
MS. N'GUM:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Lordships.  I do not want to waste time by repeating what Mr. Pognon has already said because, as far as we are concerned, this is how the events took place.  What I would like to reiterate is that, after receiving the letter of the accused person requesting for the withdrawal of his counsel, the Defence Counsel and Detention Management Section wrote to him and explained to him that it was not for him to make the decision to withdraw the counsel, but it was the Registrar's prerogative.  When we received Mr. Pognon's letter, dated 18th April, in which he was saying that he was also withdrawing himself because of the request of the accused person, the Defence Counsel and Detention Management Section reminded Mr. Pognon of his mandate and of the directive of assignment of Defence counsel.  In fact, we reminded him that, under Rule 45 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, Rule 45(I), counsel has to be assigned until the finality of the case; therefore, his mandate is to represent the accused person until he is withdrawn by the Registrar, but not because he has received letter from the accused person.

In fact, before writing that letter, I telephoned Mr. Pognon and brought these matters to his attention.  I reminded him that he was supposed to file documents by the 19th of April, in accordance with what had been decided at the status conference.  I also brought to his attention a similar matter in the case of Hassan Ngeze that, although the Accused had written several letters requesting the withdrawal of his counsel, the counsel in that case continued to represent the accused person until he actually filed the appellate brief on the day that the Registrar withdrew his representation.  Therefore, as far as the registry was concerned, Mr. Pognon's representation of the accused person had to continue until the withdrawal had been filed.  And even after the withdrawal is filed, according to Article 20(A) of the directive on the assignment of Defence counsel, counsel has to continue the representation of the accused person until the replacement counsel has been assigned.  So, although we did write to him that letter, we also wrote to him requesting for his comments on the letter that the accused person had written, requesting him for his withdraw.  And, as you are now aware, Mr. Pognon did file the requisite documents on the 19th of April.  And, in fact, he did send to us a work programme whereby he was expecting to come to Arusha 10 days before today so that he would see if it was possible to have a conference with the accused person and attempt to resolve matters amicably.  Unfortunately, although the work programme was approved, due to problems in Togo it was not possible for counsel to travel on the date that he wanted to come to Arusha.  And also we were informed that it was not possible for them to travel until the following weekend.

So, when they arrived, I had a meeting with Mr. Pognon, yesterday, and he informed me that he attempted to meet with the accused person, but the Accused had refused to meet with him.  We also received a letter from the accused person yesterday which he read in court this morning, in which he was stating that he was not going to appear in court.  But it is the Registry's belief that it should be possible to resolve this matter amicably and allow lead counsel to continue with the case.  However, in the event that the matters cannot be resolved amicably, then the Registrar will still have to consider the application of the accused person for the withdrawal of his lead counsel.

But, as Mr. Pognon stated, we have also reminded him how much the Registry has already spent on this case.  In the event that this counsel -- lead counsel has to be withdrawn, experience has shown us that it is not possible for someone else to step into the shoes of lead counsel and proceed with the case immediately.  Moreover, there's a Registrar's circular and the policy of the Registry that in an event where it is -- there is a likelihood of co-counsel having colluded with the accused person for the withdrawal of lead counsel, co-counsel can then not be assigned as lead counsel.

In that case, unless exceptional circumstances are shown, a new lead counsel would have to be appointed.  In that case, Your Lordships, it means that the new lead counsel would have to start with the case from scratch.  Our experience is that the new lead counsel would usually request for at least two months, minimum, to read the case, the documents involved in the case, and also to visit the witnesses before he can present them before the Trial Chamber.  Your Lordships, that would mean that there will be delay in that case if the lead counsel is withdrawn.

But then, it is not for the Registry at this moment in time to state what should happen.  We revert to whatever Your Lordships will decide in the matter.  Under Rule 45 ter, the Trial Chamber can request for the withdrawal of lead counsel or, at least, request for him to continue in the case in the interests of justice.  So we leave it with the Trial Chamber.
Thank you, Madam President, Your Lordships.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Aminatta N'gum.  We would now like to give the floor to the victims and witness protection section.

Yes, sir, you have the floor.  Joseph Essombe, you have the floor.  In particular, we want to know if the witnesses are here and if they are not here, for which reasons.
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:
Madam President, Your Honours, before directly responding to your question -- pardon me.  I have a request: I would ask that anything -- that during this hearing any reference to the residence -- the place of residence of the witnesses, which may have been mentioned by the counsel, should be expunged from the record.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Such will be the case.  The names -- or the pseudonyms of the witnesses have not been given, however, we have said that some witnesses reside in certain places.  Very well; we will expunge the names from the record.  I don't believe that is very important but, nonetheless, it will be expunged from the record.
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:
Thank you very much, Madam President.

Now, regarding the presence of witnesses here at the seat of the Tribunal, unfortunately, the answer is, no, they are not here.  We can assure you that all measures were taken to make sure those witnesses were present, but we lacked the most essential element; in other words, authorisation for bringing those witnesses here.  To be brief, Madam President, these are Defence witnesses.  Only the Defence, as such, can instruct us to bring them.

A bit over a week ago I spoke with Mr. Pognon.  We spoke at length over the telephone.  He explained to me that, given the circumstances which he explained earlier, it was impossible for him to ask the WVSS to bring those witnesses to Arusha.  Sometime thereafter, Madam President, I called Mr. Monthé.  He, in basically the same words, said the same thing, and so there was an impasse.

We could not bring the witnesses even though we had already contacted authorities in their countries of residence, international authorities ready to work in this kind of situation, and we even took other measures to make sure that if the Chamber asked us to bring the witnesses, we would be prepared to do so.  If the Chamber takes such a decision it would, perhaps, be better for it to know what was going on as the witnesses must be prepared.
Another situation which has made us hesitate, Madam President: in the case we bring the witnesses to Arusha and that -- we are told that these witnesses are not ready for one reason or another to appear before the Chamber, someone must assume the financial consequences of such a situation.  In brief, Madam President, Your Honours, this is the situation as it stands.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Essombe.  One question: in the case the Chamber decides to bring the witnesses, how much time would you need, given the measures that you have already taken?
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:
Madam President, we simply could put them in the plane and they could be here tomorrow morning.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, thank you.  How many witnesses are there currently who are prepared?
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:
Right now, there are 10, eight of which could be brought tomorrow in the plane.  The ninth is further away from where the plane lands and where the plane takes off.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you very much for that information.  I don't know if anyone else needs to intervene or ask questions of Mr. Essombe.  Very well.  Thank you very much, Mr. Essombe.

Mr. Pognon, have you asked for the floor?  Yes, you may proceed.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I say this in all seriousness with which I have always conducted myself in this profession.  I have understood that for some people, they can come and speak before the Tribunal.  In doing so, it can seem like it is being forced upon them against their own will.  As I explained in my letter, the Accused has a free conscience; he is a human being who can freely think and he works with counsel, and that relationship must be described as a marriage based on trust.  That is for the Accused.

Now, as for counsel, he is a human being as well, who also has freedom to act, and when he acts, he does so with his own conscience.  I don't want to give a philosophy course here, but simply say that he is a human being, fully with his own personal identity.

There is no test in the world that obliges counsel to continue.  You must continue even though the Accused has rejected you, because in such a case we would not be dealing with human beings, but animals, and I don't know if such a test applies to animals.  That test applies to human beings.  This is dehumanising.  What is said from the other side is dehumanising; it is completely ignoring my being.  It's not only an insult to the profession, but also an insult to the man himself.

1035H
MR. POGNON (continued):
Happily, from time to time, before this Tribunal, and this isn't the first time, the Tribunal has considered that counsel and the Accused are human beings who have dignity and they are allowed to go when the relationship of trust is broken.  

There are accused persons here, detainees here, who have conducted their trial with three different counsel; the last was Ferran, my friend from Montpellier, who was rejected by his accused.  The Accused said he was not satisfied with his work.  Perhaps he was more experienced than I, was calmer than I, perhaps.  He said that this could be explained by professional and cultural differences between him and his client.  He used those calm words.  Everyone doesn't necessarily consider me calm, but my wife knows that I'm calm and that's enough for me.  Now, Counsel Ferran from Montpellier left.  But, perhaps, the colour of my skin -- things are different here.  I am a colonised -- country -- forced work was -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel -- counsel, please.  
MR. POGNON:
I say it and I say it loud.  I am forced to work, and this is insulting to me.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel.
MR. POGNON:
I'm telling the Prosecutor, "Stop insulting me."  Throughout this whole trial I have been insulted. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, if you proceed in that manner, I will ask you to sit down.  
MR. POGNON:
You ask me to leave.  You can simply authorise me to leave.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Calm down, Counsel.  If you wish to speak -- 
MR. POGNON:
We are not in colonial times.  They cannot force me to work.  The Rules of Procedure and Evidence are there as an international instrument.  Each year it's modified in favour of the Judges and the Prosecutor and I'm imposed -- obliged to stay here.  I refuse to be insulted.  I say this clearly: Ferran left.  I am counsel just as he is.  He is my colleague from Montpellier.  We are often in the same meetings together.  I consider myself as have left -- as I've left as well.  Simply ask the registry to appoint a new counsel.  The situation that the registry has just described -- they say they have incurred a certain number of expenses.  I did not incur those expenses.  I began to work.  I have my witnesses ready; some are there.  My notes are still there and -- paid up until November 2004 and paid peanuts in a currency that continues to fall, but I kept working.  And even all the time I took those -- the time I took to take those notes was lost time.  I will write this and I will say it loud.  

The way I see things ethically in my profession, my ethical vision of the profession simply must deal with human dignity - human being, and that has been violated by what the Prosecutor has said.  And the situation that -- has been manipulated at leisure.  This will not be tolerated by Mr. Alfred Pognon.  I no longer defend Athanase Seromba, the priest, and that is his will.  

The Prosecutor can do what he will with that and say what he will of my work.  Everything they have done up until now.  And it's their problem, their responsibility.  My wish is simply to meet again in more favourable circumstances one day.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, then, if there are no other statements, the Judges have consulted with one another.  We are of the opinion that, under the present circumstances, we should wait for the registry to proceed with the mediation mentioned and that a decision should be taken, more so as a motion has been filed with the registry regarding the disagreement between the Accused and his lead counsel.  

In any case, we hope that the matter will be resolved because the Chamber has done everything possible to expedite these proceedings.  Unfortunately, we have encountered many difficulties and now that the situation is apparently moving in favour of continuation of this trial, with the presentation of the Defence case, we have this problem which has arisen between the Accused and his lead counsel.  

Today the co-counsel was supposed to be present.  He is not here.  Lead counsel has told the Chamber all he had to say.  The co-counsel, of course, has a right to respond.  He will receive the transcripts of this hearing and he will also be able to react.  

We are expecting the registry to react and to take the necessary measures to move this trial forward.  Everyone will be informed in time, of course, when the Chamber's decision will be taken.  We thank you.  

The Court is adjourned. 
(Court adjourned at 1055H)
