 MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is in session.  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  

Good morning, Witness. Are you feeling well this morning?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Madam President, the interpreter is under the impression that the witness is not listening to the to the Kinyarwanda channel. 
THE WITNESS: 
Good morning, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  I believe you do hear us now?  
THE WITNESS: 
I hear you perfectly, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Mr. Witness.

Mr. Prosecutor, you have the floor for the remainder of the cross-examination of this witness. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, I just want to begin by clarifying a couple of points.  The first is in relation to the account that you gave of your friend Everiste, whom you say was shot.  Now, my question for you, without you having to give us a description of what you have already done, can you just tell the Court where -- where do you say that Everiste was shot - the place -- can you tell us the place?  Thank you.  
A.	Madam President, Your Honours; my friend Evariste was shot on the road leading towards the church, next to the place where the bodies were piled up. 
Q.	So, approaching from the Gitarama main road, you go past the statue of the Virgin Mary, and then there is a road leading up to the church, are you saying it was on that road that your friend Evariste was shot? 
A.	My friend Evariste was killed at the location the Prosecutor just indicated.  We had gone past the statue of the Virgin Mary and were close to the headquarters of CARITAS and of the shops of the Nyange trading centre. 
Q.	And this was some time after 9 o'clock in the morning on Saturday, the 16th of April 1994; is that right? 
A.	Evariste was shot between 9:30 and 10:00, because when he was shot, I had not yet seen the Zairian citizen -- or replaced, rather, the Zairian citizen who was driving that machine. 
Q.	Without asking you to estimate the exact number of people who were around the church at that time, would you agree with me that there were a great number of people who were surrounding the church at that time? 
A.	In answering the Prosecutor's question, I will say that I never denied the fact that there were many people coming from different locations and who were at the church.  I could not identify them by name, but it is true that there were many people there. 
Q.	Yesterday, in your evidence-in-chief, you, I believe, had said that if anyone had to say that I was not coerced into destroying the church, they would be lying; is that a fair statement of what you had said yesterday? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I would like to reiterate that if anybody affirmed that I had not been coerced into destroying the church, that person would be lying.  And, I might add, that the person who was with me and who refused to execute the orders given was killed. 
Q.	Would you agree with me, Witness, that the judges in Rwanda did not believe your story of your friend being shot and your being coerced; did they? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, as I asserted previously, when I was interviewed by the first deputy, Gaston, he used it as a pretext and ruled that I had not been coerced into destroying the church.  But the other witnesses, who had testified before that chamber, did say that I acted under duress.
Q.	The judges -- which was my question, Witness, the judges in Rwanda, both at the trial and appeal, did not accept the story of your friend being shot, did they? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And it would surprise you, Witness, that we have heard many, many, accounts both from witnesses from both the Prosecution and the Defence describing the events of the morning of the 16th of April, and no one describes anyone being shot on the road, by you, walking up to the church.  Does that surprise you, Witness? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours.  This proposition made by the Prosecutor comes as a great surprise to me, because before Friday and even though I was not present on the site, when the bodies were being buried, using the bulldozer, those were the bodies that were on the road leading to the presbytery.  When I got there, I found a Mitima -- one Mitima, who was burying the bodies. 
Q.	You have been talking a lot in your evidence in-chief about the truth, Witness; the truth is that you made up that story about your friend being shot in order to downplay your own involvement.  That is the truth; isn't it? 
A.	As regards the death of Evariste, we asserted the fact that Evariste had been killed at Nyange.  So, there is not doubt what-so-ever that Evariste was killed at Nyange and that we were together.  And that whoever does not believe that thing would be lying, because my friend was killed while I was there, and he was the victim of a crime that was perpetrated by other people. 
Q.	Well, I want to move on to another account, Witness, with relation to the people who were inside the church when you bulldozed it; is it your evidence that the people who were inside the church were alive or dead at the time you bulldozed the church? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours; I have explained previously that there were people in the church who were already dead, as well as people who were still alive, but I provided explanations by saying that no one had survived, and I did not deny that fact.  The drivers of the bulldozers were going towards the locations, or, rather, were going inside the church where the people were hiding.
Q.	Is that the story you gave the court, Witness, in Rwanda?  Did you tell them that some people were alive and some people were dead -- or did you give a different story to the court in Rwanda? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I was not able to reach an agreement with the judges in Rwanda, because they were using the evidence that had been tainted by the soldiers who coerced me that there were 2000 people in the church, and that I had brought the bulldozers and that I had killed them.  I was not able to agree with the judges in Rwanda, because I had said that on the previous Friday, grenades as well as dynamites had been thrown on the church as well as other traditional weapons, and I said that when I got to the site, there were some people who were still alive and others that were dead, but the judges wanted me to say that I was the one who had killed the 2000 people who were in the church. 
Q.	Is it the case, Witness, that you told this Court that everyone in the church was dead at the time you bulldozed it?  
A.	I wish to explain to the Prosecutor that there is a document, or, rather, that on some documents your statement are contained, but are expressed in a different way.  I have stated throughout, that there were people who were already dead in the church, but I also said that there might have been people who were still alive.  The authorities were showing the drivers those places where they were to go with the bulldozers, and that is the reason for which I apologised to the Rwandan authorities, and that I said I was coerced into doing what I did, and that there was nothing else I could do.  I was coerced into destroying the church. 
Q.	All right.  We may come back to that later.  What I want to move to now, Witness, is the prime line of your movements, and this is after you were arrested.  Am I correct in saying that you were arrested in Rwanda on or about the 13th of February 1995? 
A.	I remember having been arrested on the 13th of February 1995.  Yes, indeed, that was the date on which I was arrested. 
Q.	Now, I don't recall you saying so, but my learned friend, Mr. Monthé, indicated to the President, yesterday, that according to your evidence, you were in a hall for weeks; was that right?  You were placed in a hall for two weeks? 
A.	That is true.  I spent two weeks in a hall.  I was in there for two weeks.  However, in my case file it is stated that I was in a communal jail during that period.  They didn't state that we were in a hall.  They wrote that we were at the communal jail.  If you carry out investigations, you will observe or note that that was what was being said at the time.  They didn't say that we were the hall; they said we were at the communal jail. 
Q.	And then you remained in the -- yes, Witness? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
Yes, Witness?  
THE WITNESS: 
I want to say something about a hall so that things are clear.  If there is anyone who carried out investigations at the time or with respect to that period.  There was somebody -- a white man, by the name Christophe, and he was able to pull several people from that hall, because hose who were in the hall, who succeeded in coming out, were pulled out by Christophe, and that white worked for the 
Red Cross. 
Q.	And it was -- and I believe it was September 1997 that you entered into a confession that you were telling us about yesterday that was not accepted, according to you, by the deputy prosecutor in the confession box, and according to you, because you had refused to make any statement against 
	Father Seromba; is that correct? 
A.	As I had already stated, I was summoned to the public prosecutor's office, and the first deputy prosecutor, by the name Gaston, told me that my confession had been rejected because there were some details that were missing, for instance, the fact that I had not mentioned the role played by Father Seromba in what happened at the Nyange church.  He then suggested that I draft a confession for myself, and I refused.  On that occasion he told me that he was going to seek a death sentence against me.
Q.	So, according to your evidence as of the -- I think it is 24th November -- I apologise, I said September.  As of the of the 24th November 1997, you had refused to cooperate with Gaston, the Prosecutor Gaston, in respect to implicating the Accused Seromba?  
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I notice that the Prosecutor now has the correct date on which that incident occurred on which that incident occurred.  As far as I am concerned, we did not receive any copies, and if he refers to that date, I agree with him.  I am not trying to challenge that or deny that.   
Q.	When was the initial judgment against you from the Kibuye court rendered?  
A.	The judgment was handed down on the 17th of April 1998. 
Q.	And the appeal judgment, do you remember when the appeals judgement was rendered? 
A.	I won't to be able to tell you that I was the only one who faced -- who had problems with courts in Rwanda, with respect to the appeals chamber.  There were lots of people who launched appeals and whose matters were not dealt with.  There was a certain Jean-Pierre, who dealt with our case files at appeal.  He kept calling us Interahamwe, and he said that what we wrote was baseless.  He would say, for instance, that we should be satisfied with the judgment of the specialised branch of the court of first instance.  He would say, for instance, that the appeals were received, but for most people he would say it would not be necessary to appeal.  You asked me for explanations, and I would like to ask,
	Madam President, if -- I do have a small problem to put to her. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, the question I put to you was the following:  Was the date you gave us, that of the appeals judgment or when after the court of first instance judgment was delivered, was the matter handled at appeals level, and the decision of the court of first instance was on what day?  The appeals judgement was on what day?  And, at the same, please explain to us and then make the comment that you want to make.  
THE WITNESS: 
Madam President, Your Honours, I told you that the court of first instance delivered its judgment on the 17th of April 1998.  As for the Ruhengeri Appeals Chamber, we appealed, but we didn't manage to know when judgment was delivered.  Notice was not served on us as to whether our appeal had been admitted or entertained.  We were, merely told, orally, I believe it was in the year 2000, 2001, we were told that the judgment had been rendered, but a list of people was brought, that is, those who were tried.  There were several people.  I cannot mention all their names.  There was a certain 
Kayumba, Seratierre, and we were told that some of our appeals had not been received and others had been handed over to the appeals chamber.  So, that is the explanation that I wanted to provide to that question, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.

Prosecutor, you may proceed. 
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honours.
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, yesterday you were shown, by the Defence counsel, a document D. 79, stating a letter you had written to the minister of internal security in Kigali; do you remember being shown that letter? 
A.	Yes, I do.  Actually, it was a letter that I wrote requesting that I be transferred from the Gitarama - sorry, from Kibuye prison yard to that of Gitarama. 
Q.	The date of letter was the 30th of January 2001.  I am wondering, bearing in mind the date of that letter; was that letter written before or after you had been advised that the appeal -- your appeal had been unsuccessful? 
A.	I drafted that letter after the messenger of the Ruhengeri Appeals Chamber informed us of the judgment that had been delivered.  He came and held a meeting with the prisoners who had already been tried, and it was on that occasion that he gave us that information.  I don't know whether the Prosecutor is satisfied with the answer that I have just provided.  But again, I had sought your permission to state a problem here.  I don't know whether I am allowed to do so?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we told you that you are allowed to state whatever you want to say before the Court.  
THE WITNESS: 
Madam President, Your Honours, thank you.  I find it interesting to be cross-examined by the Prosecutor, but if I go by some of the procedures as they apply in Rwanda, I would like to say that there was a letter that I wrote to the Supreme Court in Rwanda.  I believe it was in 2001.  There was another letter that I wrote on the 25th of February 2002 and again, addressed to the Supreme Court.  In those letters I was asking that the judgment rendered by the court of appeal be overturned, and I was never told whether my request was entertained.  We were told, merely by word of mouth, that the judgment rendered had to stand, and that we should place our fate in God.  I think, therefore -- I think, therefore, that in view of the fact that the Defence counsel never brought this document before this court to question me on it, that document should no longer be considered, because the Rwandan authorities never wanted that that document be used.  And so, I merely wanted to say to you that no one should rely on a document that the Rwandan authorities never wanted to be used.

That is the problem I wanted to submit to you -- to raise with you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is duly noted, Witness.

Prosecutor, please proceed.  
THE WITNESS: 
Madam President, I thank you. 
BY MR. MOSES: 
Q.	Witness, I was left a little unclear from you evidence yesterday, and I am wondering if you can assist us.  In that letter you were referring to the fact that you if you were referring to the fact that if you were transferred it would not stop you from assisting the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and my understanding of what you had said yesterday was that at that stage as at January 2001, you had not yet assisted the Rwandan Judicially or the ICTR, is it my understanding correct? 
A.	Let me answer the question the Prosecutor just asked me.  Let me say this, that until now, I don't know whether he said that my transfer was going to enable me not to appear here to testify.  I would like to know what he said -- I would like him to ask that question again, because I don't believe I made any such statement yesterday.
Q.	All right.  I will repeat it.  In the letter which we have had produced it is said that -- it is recorded that this is what you had written:  "Hence if I were to be transferred to the said prison, it would mot prevent me from continuing to assist the Rwandan judiciary and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda."  Now, yesterday you commented on that particular sentence, and my question for you is; as at the date of writing this letter had you already commenced to assist either the Rwandan judiciary or the ICTR, or was it only after that date? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I believe you do know when the ICTR was established.  I believe yesterday we discussed certain statements and already in 2001, I had made certain statements to the officers of the ICTR, if I am not mistaken.  I am not sure that you can assist me, but you can always refer to those documents and then they can clarify matters for you.  And I am saying that I was prepared to work with the ICTR, and that I would be ready to assist the Rwandan authorities.  You know that at the time the government of Rwanda was searching for those involved or implicated in the genocide so that such persons appear as witnesses. 
Q.	All right.  Now, you also, in the course of your evidence-in-chief that at there were problems which we don't need to go into, but you had described in great detail that you say you had encountered with certain Rwandan authorities, and, in particular, the prosecutors.  And you also indicated that the situation improved and that the situation was improved and that you were able, as you say, express yourself more openly.  What I am wanting you to advise the Trial Chamber is:  When did the situation improve, according to you? 
A.	I would like to answer the questions -- the question just put to me by the Prosecutor.  I know for now that the senior official of the country have urged us to tell the truth.  That is the reason why the Gacaca courts were established.  So, you shouldn't seek to compare the current situation that of 2006 and what prevailed in 1995.  Now, people come together and they discuss, and if there is someone who accused his or neighbour falsely, such a person can deny or dispute it, and that is the reason why I decided to appear here just to tell the truth.  We meet in Rwanda, we discuss, and we tell the truth.  If you were to go to Nyange, you will find people who are testifying for or on behalf of people who had already been incriminated.  And, by the way, I learnt that you intend to go to the location, and in that way, you will see for yourself. 
Q.	Listen carefully to the question, please, Witness.  When did the situation, according to you, improve?  Was it in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, or 2006?  When is it, according to you that the situation improved so that you felt, according to your evidence, able to be open with the authorities? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I will answer the Prosecutor's question and to tell him that the situation started improving as from when it was said that anyone who accepted to confess could be released.  I know that you cooperate with Rwandan authorities, and they do hand over some case files to you -- some documents to you.  You could consult those documents and you would be able to notice when the situation started improving. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, are we to understand that you are not in a position to tell us the date, or you do not want to tell us the date.  You are on the ground, you can answer the question, and you can answer the Prosecutor's question. The Prosecutor wants to know as from when the situation changed, that is, along the lines that you mentioned.  
THE WITNESS: 
Madam President, Your Honours, if I am not mistaken, I would say it was in 2003 that some people who had accepted to confess were released, at least those who were telling the truth.  It should be stated that those who did not tell the truth were not released.  So, it was from 2003 that there were some problems of concern to you.  So you can remember the dates, but the others won't be of any interest to you. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.

Prosecutor.
BY MR. MOSES: 
Q.	When was the time that you met the representative from the Defence for Seromba; which year was that? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, before answering that question, I would like, again, to crave your indulgence, I won't be specific because I am not in good health.  And I think that the very first time that I met with the Defence team, that should be in 2004.  That would be the very first time that I met them.  I do not remember the date or the month.
Q.	All Right.  But it was before you travelled to Arusha, wasn't it?  Before you travelled to Arusha to testify for the prosecution? 
A.	I met with the Defence team after all the Prosecution witnesses had testified before this Court.  I did not meet with the team before that period.  I would like to be more specific.  When the Defence team approached me, I told -- I asked them whether they wanted me to come to Arusha once again, to be faced with the same situation which I was faced with before, and they told me that I was free to come and testify before the court, because the court needed me.  I had never met them before.  It was on that occasion that I was first contacted by them. 
Q.	All right.  Could we now -- I would ask you to please be shown Defence Exhibit 81 -- Defence 
	Exhibit D. 81, and I will ask that you be shown the Kinyarwanda version.

Now, yesterday the -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, you may proceed.  
MR. MOSES: 
I sent copies for Your Honours, if it would assist.  There is one English copy and two French -- two French copies.
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, Witness, yesterday, you were read the first paragraph of this document, and what I want to do is go throughout the remainder of the document with you.  First of all, can we confirm that 4th of March was less than 10 months after -- or around 10 months after the events at Nyange parish in April 1994? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I would not like to insist on this document.  As the Prosecutor did say, the document was drafted 10 months after the events that had taken place in the Nyange Church. 
Q.	Well, let us see what it says under the passage which reads:  "This is what I did."  Using the bulldozer, I pulled down the walls and roof on the people and they died.  After they died I was ordered to dig mass graves to burry them.  I picked up the bodies with the bulldozer and dropped them into mass grave to bury them.  I then put the soil back over to cover up the grave.  After completing the job, 
	Father Seromba gave me 6,000 Rwandan francs, and Rabaud gave me 30,000 Rwandan francs. I confess and admit that I committed these crimes."  Now, that is what you first said to the Rwandan authorities at the beginning of March 1995, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, I do see the document that was given to me and this only proves what I had said previously.  I told you that I had been coerced into making such a statement.  The document was drafted by a soldier named Emmanuel.  I see that mention is made of 6,000 Rwandan francs and 30,000 Rwandan Francs that would have been given to me.  When the document was drafted, I was in a room which was used as a clinic for the prisoners.  Some documents were drafted regarding my case, and I always remember those who drafted the documents.  This document is not a document I wrote myself, which means that it does not reflect any statement I might have made.  This is a pack the lies.  Nobody ever gave me money and proof of that matter is that at that date, Rabaud was not in Kivumo.  Mention was made of 30,000 Rwandan francs which would have been given to me, but I believe this document is baseless.  It was drafted by a soldier called Emmanuel and another one called Imusa who hailed from the Rwamatamo commune.  The two individuals were questioning me.  Besides, there are other documents such as the ones that were drafted when I was in SONARWA the documents were drafted by the authorities and not by myself, and I thereby disagree with the contents of these documents. 
Q.	Well, do you disagree that you, using the bulldozer, you pulled down the walls and the people died?  Is that a pack of lies? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I am not denying the fact that the church was destroyed, and I am not denying the fact that I destroyed the church either, but I was coerced into doing so by the authorities.  Of course, the walls did collapse, but as I said before this Court, on the 15th grenades had been thrown on the church, and some people had been killed on the 15th.  It's true that I destroyed the walls of the church, and I do believe that there were people inside the church who were sill alive.  I am not denying that fact.  If one could go to the church, one would realise that the church no longer exists. 
Q.	So, it is not all a pack of lies that is contained in here, then, according to you? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I confessed that I destroyed the church, but I was coerced into doing so.  But I disagree on the number of victims which was mentioned; 2000 people, is a number I cannot accept.  I also disagree with the fact that Seromba would have given me the order to destroy the church and that 6,000 Rwandan francs or 30,000 Rwandan francs would have been given to me.  Those are the facts I deny.  I believe the name of the person who interviewed me should also have been mentioned.  I do know that when ICTR investigators come and meet with you, they put their names on the statement.  On the statement I have before my eyes, I do not see the name of the person who questioned me.  I don't know if it is the time that I spent in prison, but I do not see the name of the person or persons who questioned me on this statement.
Q.	Witness, this whole story of being coerced into making the statement it is not something that you have either alleged to the Rwandan authorities at any stage, is it?  Nor is anything that you ever alleged to either the ICTR investigators nor is it something that you ever told the Defence counsel in any statement that you gave to him that you had been coerced.  It is simply a story you have made up to try and explain away the fact that you implicated the Accused Seromba, that is why you made up a story about being coerced, isn't it? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, if I laughed, it is not because I am laughing at the question that was just put to me.  May I tell you that the events that took place in the church touched me.  If I laughed is because I see that the Prosecutor is persisting in saying that I was not coerced into doing what I did.

Mr. Prosecutor, I met with a member of your team, and I told him that I had been coerced.  I remember the conversation we had.  He told me, I believe you cannot be held responsible for your acts, because you were coerced.  But I do know that when the Prosecutor's team meet, and that there is material that might be of an exculpatory nature, then they do not mention it in the statement.  And I know also that there were people who had told me that they had forgiven me because I was Tutsi like the others.  So, when I remember all this, it makes me really sad. 
Q.	Witness, I am talking about you making that statement.  Not only on the church, I am suggesting to you that you have never, in any statement, either to the Rwandan authorities or the Defence, you never mentioned at any stage that you had been tortured or coerced into making any statement in Rwanda.  First time you ever mentioned that was in the last couple of days? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, when I address an audience I always start by saying that I was coerced.  I wonder why the Prosecutor persists in saying that I made no such statement in front of the Rwandan authorities.  I do know that there is a team of journalists that presented a movie, a film, on the work that is being done here at the Tribunal.  We watched that film in June 2002, which recounted the activities or events occurring here at the Tribunal.  There are a number of facts on which we were not able to agree.  One Kagenza disagreed with me, but he did accept the fact that I had been coerced.  So if Kagenza, himself recognised this, I was coerced in doing what I did, I do not see how the Prosecutor can deny that fact.
Q.	Well, I we will leave that fact.  No doubt, my learned friend will point it out to you the statement where you have made allegations against the Rwandan authorities that I have not been able to locate.

I will now refer you to a new document, one that you haven't been shown during your evidence-in-chief, it is a document dated the 19th of April 1995.  
MR. MOSES:
I just want to make sure that my learned friend has of the French and Kinyarwandan copy of the statement. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, Witness, that is the statement that you gave on the 19th of April 1995, isn't it, with Mr. Mbera, M-B-E-R-A, of the public prosecutor's office? 
A.	Could you be so kind as to repeat the date that you just provided, counsel, so that I might check if it is, indeed, the date I am thinking of?  
Q.	The first line, I think it is in French or the Kinyarwanda copy, but it is the 19th of April 1995.  
A.	Thank you.  I see the date of the 20th of April, rather, the 22nd of August.  That is the date I see on the document.  I do not know whether this is perhaps not another document, but I do I see on the document I have in my possession, the date of 22nd August 1995. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registrar, could you, please, show the document to the Prosecutor?  Could you please take the document from the witness and show it to the Prosecutor?  
MR. MOSES:
The French booth have the Kinyarwandan original.  The first paragraph is in French, the introduction with the date, and I ask if they could just read out the first sentence. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the Kinyarwanda booth has the document in its possession, but did not understand what the Prosecutor requested.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It was asked that the first sentence in the Kinyarwanda document be read out in French.  In any case, perhaps it will perhaps it will be necessary to give the document to the French booth, for it to read out the beginning of this document, and then that way, the witness will be able to follow.  
MR. MOSES:
Madam President, that is not possible because we use the same channel.  
BY MR. MOSES: 
Q.	I could perhaps try reading.  I will try not to do much damage to the French language and read out the first sentence. "1995, on this 19th day of April," you follow, Witness?  Do you accept that that is the document that was made by you as a result of an interview with Mr. Mbera.  Do you remember meeting Mr. Mbera and making that statement?  
A.	Madam President, Your Honours; in 1995 the Prosecutor says that there were Prosecutors in Rwanda?  That cannot be possible.  In 1995 there were agents called PCs, and there were also deputies.  So, in Kibuye, where I made such a  statement in 1995, and more especially in April, I was still imprisoned in Kibuye.  The soldiers were those who were taking care of the judicial activities.  I do not believe there was a public prosecutor at the time.  So, I was not interviewed by a member of the public prosecutor's office.  If you take a close look at this document, you will not find my signature on it.  I am convinced that there was no public prosecutor in Kibuye in 1995.
Q.	Your name has a thumbprint on it at the bottom of the second page, Witness. 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, ever since I met with the public prosecutor in Rwanda, I have never put my thumbprint or a fingerprint on any document whatsoever.  I have always signed.  I was being requested to sign the documents as proof or authenticity.  I would like to say or to tell the Prosecutor, that there is another statement which was prior to this one, and you will note that there is no fingerprint on that statement.  I believe that you have just taken a fingerprint from somewhere, but I do know that I never put my fingerprint on this document. 
Q.	Do you agree with me that there is your name on it, and that you are the son of Rubashangabo?  
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, the judge knew me, and the soldiers were the ones who drafted those documents.  Those soldiers knew me very well, they knew the names of my parents, and I am telling you truthfully, that when I was in the Kibuye prison there was no public prosecutor.  When people were arrested in Kibuye, they were sent to Gitarama prison, and once in Gitarama, they would meet with the judicial authorities such as the prosecutor.  I persist in saying that I never put my fingerprints on this document. 
Q.	You never made a statement on the 19th of April 1995 - that would be this document -- you never made that -- or any statement on the 19th of April 1995? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, and the statement I made before the soldiers are many.  I disagree with the Prosecutor, in that there are statements I made myself which I do admit that there are some statements contained in the document which were, indeed, made by myself, but I disagree with the Prosecutor regarding the fingerprints.  I remember that I was coerced or forced to sign documents and I signed so many documents that my fingers were hurting.  So, I do not understand why I should be told today that I put a fingerprint on a document. 
Q.	So, did you tell someone who interviewed you under coercion or otherwise, that you had co-perpetrators killings at Nyange or the bourgmestre of Kivumo commune who was in exile, Kayishema the communal investigations officer of Kivumo commune; one magistrate of the tribunal de canton, whose name you didn't know.  Those are the people who came to see you at the camp site and ordered you to take part in the killings.  They are the ones who ordered you to bring the bulldozer to excavate pits for burying the bodies, but you did in the company of the Nyange parish priest.  Is that something you told soldiers and investigators?  I know you have given a lot of statements; is that something you said, previously? 
A.	Let me just give you some proof.  Unimpeachable proof.  I admit, and I do acknowledge the fact that the authorities just referred to by the Prosecutor, did have a role to play in the demolition of the church, and that I, myself, participated in the demolition of the church.  But I would ask the Prosecutor to forget about a particular name among those that he mentioned.  I am referring to father Seromba.  He never gave me the order to demolish the church.  As for the names of the other officials mentioned, I told you that they were the ones who told me to demolish the church, and I make mention of this in several documents. 
Q.	In several documents you also refer to the fact that Father Seromba was one of your co-perpetrators, don't you?  In fact that is one of the documents in which you do so; isn't that so? 
A.	At the very beginning of my testimony, I believe I did explain why I did mention Father Seromba's name. Torture, my stay in the hall when electrical shocks were applied in my body, I believe I spoke at length about this before this Court.  You have all of that in your documents; documents of the Prosecutor and of the Defence.  And I have always said that I have come before this Court to testify freely, and now that I have the opportunity to come before this Court to speak freely, it is necessary for  you to take into account my evidence -- my testimony here, not documents drafted while I was being coerced.  So, I said in my testimony or evidence that it was not the priest who asked me to demolish the church.
Q.	Later the Defence will show you the statements that you gave to the Defence, and they will point out the parts that you say you gave to them where you say you were given electrical shocks.  But, now I would like to go to another exhibit, Exhibit D. 82 a document you recognised and was produced by the Defence as the statement dated the 22nd July 1997 
MR. MOSES:
Do Your Honours have copies of that document?  If you don't, I will give you copies. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you give us a copy, because we don't have.  All right, we checked.  Thank you 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, you may recall yesterday you were asked questions Mr. Monthé for the Defence in relation to an answer you had given to question six in the statement, and it was in relation to a passage where the answer recorded in the statement was that you had -- when I asked Kayishema what was going to happen now that people had been killed in that church, that he went to rear courtyard of the presbyterian with Father Seromba:  "The priest asked me to destroy the church and added that they were going to build another one."  I put the following question to him, "Are we going to destroy the house of God?"  And he replied, "Destroy it.  We will build another one." I demolished it starting from the other side of the door."  It goes on to say, "I shoved the bricks to the side, in order to be able to reach the courtyard and to burry them.  I worked for three days.  Now, you had given, to the Trial Chamber yesterday, your account -- how that was a statement that was coerced from you.  Now, is it my understanding -- can you please tell us; are you saying to the Trial Chamber that those are words that you used or are these words that you put down by the investigations officer who was trying to get you to implicate Father Seromba? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I wish to say that I have answered that question on several occasions.  I was asked questions about a number of people in the church; how I drove the bulldozer right up to the church, how I destroyed or demolished the church; I spoke of the capacity of the church, something between 1,500 and 2000.  To all those questions; I provided answers.  You telling me that I never told the Defence team that no electric shocks were applied to my body?  Well, in the course of my interrogations, and if in my testimony I made reference to that incident, it is not mistake on my part.  You can come and question me and I can provide you with some information, and if there are other information that I did not remember or that I did not provide, I do have a right to provide such information before the Court.  As for these statements, I have told you time and time gain, that I made certain statements in order to please some people who wanted me to implicate Father Seromba. 
Q.	Well, this statement was taken by the criminal investigations officer, Gaston Nsengimuremye, this is the person who you have talked about in your evidence-in-chief.  Is it your evidence that this person was not interested in your account of what happened and only wanted you to be convicted and also Father Seromba? 
A.	Gaston was a major impediment in this matter and he was not alone -- a major impediment, not only in my case, but also in the case Father Kayiranga.  He wanted to use me all the time to ensure that 
	Father Seromba is convicted.  He said to openly.  He said so to people, and he said, "If 
	Father Seromba is convicted, the Catholic Church's involvement would be proven."  So, he did everything in his power to ensure that charged are brought against Father Seromba.  I also wish to say that there was a captain who came to Nyange to carry out investigations, but when I pleaded guilty, we noticed that a copy of the investigations carried out by the captain had disappeared or was missing.  Which is to say, that Gaston Nsengimuremye was not a serious person; it was someone who did not like his job.
Q.	Well, I think you referred, to a question put to you yesterday as well, who was the one who encouraged you to destroy the church, and the answer you gave was, "Kayishema and Father Seromba."  Would you agree with me, Witness, that this statement contains, on the face of it, very, very strong allegations against Father Seromba?  I am not saying whether you accept it as true or not, but on the face of that statement, it makes very strong allegations against Father Seromba, don't they? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, regarding this document and the question put to me by the Prosecutor, you are saying that these allegations made by myself against Father Seromba are serious, but have you heard me in this Court - before this Bench accusing him or bringing such allegations against him?  If there weren't these allegations, he wouldn't be here in this prison or in detention.  It's obvious that there were allegations brought against him.
Q.	These are allegations you made in the statement to Gaston on the 22nd July 1997, correct? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, the Prosecutor is asking me whether I didn't make any allegations against the priest.  Prosecutor, why have I appeared ere?  Why haven't I taken off?  My purpose was to clearly state before the Court that Father Seromba is innocent in spite of what I stated earlier. 
Q.	All right.  Witness, just listen to my question.  At the moment, I am not asking you about what you have said in Court today.  All I am asking you is a simple question.  Do you agree that on the 22nd of July 1997, you gave a statement to Gaston Nsengimuremye, where you made strong allegations against Father Seromba?  A simple question; yes or no? 
A.	Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  Let me answer the Prosecutor's question.  I always told you, Prosecutor, and I tried to explain the aims of Gaston.  Gaston's purpose or aim was to bring allegations against Father Seromba.  We spoke of some other statements in which Father Seromba's name does not appear, and I told you that the public prosecutor's office rejected my guilty pleas and my confession, because I did not mention Seromba's name in the document. 
Q.	Which is exactly my next question, Witness.  You told this Trial Chamber that the same Gaston, in November -- 21st November 1997, few months after this statement was recorded in front of him, you said he did not accept your guilty plea because you did not -- you refused to implicate Seromba.  You would have got in front of us, a statement made by you, made in front of Gaston -- the same Gaston, where you strongly implicate Seromba.  So, what I am saying to you -- suggesting to you, Witness, is that you are lying -- not telling the truth when you are saying that the reason Gaston refused to accept your guilty plea was because you refused to implicate Seromba, because clearly, that is not exactly true; isn't it? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours let me reply to the Prosecutor.  What Gaston was saying was based on allegations or he relied on documents that received from the soldiers who were interrogating me while I was in the hall.  And where we went, wherever we went, we were with the soldiers, we were being interrogated and Gaston had to produce some other document.  I know that he questioned me and that he had some other documents, and that document his sole purpose was to bring charges or make allegations against Seromba.  Gaston was telling us, "You the detainees, once you get to prison, you start denying the crimes that you committed.  But let me remind you that I was not above the law or above those authorities who were pursuing particular ends which amounted to Father Seromba being convicted."  But I have appeared before this court to say that Father Seromba could not have played any role in the demolition of his own church. 
Q.	But, Witness, you had told the Trial Chamber, yesterday that your guilty plea was not accepted because you refused to implicate Seromba in front of that same investigations officer who refused to accept your guilty plea, you did implicate Seromba.  What I am suggesting to you is that the refusal to accept your guilty please had nothing to do with the fact of mentioning Seromba in your statement or not.  It was simply, he didn't accept your story and particularly that of Evariste being shot? 
A.	The Prosecutor is asking me questions about Gaston, and he is telling me that I had modified my statement.  When I met Gaston the first time, he brought all the documents which were prepared while I was being questioned by soldiers, and he asked me whether I was the one who made those statements, and, of course, my answer was yes.  I could not explain to him that while I was in the hall the soldiers had forced me to say a number of things.  So, when I was questioned by the soldiers and then by Gaston, it was one and the same thing.

1100H
MR. MOSES:
I've just about finished with this document, Your Honour.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	I have -- can I refer you to question 10 in that statement, Witness.  The question reads, "At the time you destroyed the church" --
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	All right.  I'll read it out to you:  

"At the time you destroyed the church, weren't the persons inside it still alive?"  

"A.  I saw nobody alive in there."  

"If some people were to contend that there were people still alive inside the church and that not even the killers were able to go inside, what would you say to that?"

"A.  If that were the case, I would be guilty."  

Now, Witness, earlier today you told us that you hadn't said that people were all dead inside the church.  It seems to contradict what you have said earlier.  Can you enlighten the Trial Chamber on why you had said that earlier today and why this statement appears to contradict what you have said?  
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I will provide an answer to the question of the Prosecutor.  And I will be specific.  It is stated here that people were dead.  That's right, there were people who had been killed.  I know that there was a 16-year-old boy who alleged that he survived the massacre at the church, and the said child stated that when he left the church virtually everyone inside the church was dead.  I personally had never seen that child and I could not rely on what he said.  What I know is that when I got to that place, they had started killing the refugees, but inside the church there were people who were still alive.  Where I do not agree with you is that when the bulldozer arrived and started demolishing the church.  Within the church there were -- or, all those who were within the church were still alive.  No, that was not the case.  There were some people who had not yet been killed.  
Q.	One final question on this document:  Witness, this morning you told the Trial Chamber that you saw some people alive inside the church when you were destroying it, and here you say, "I saw nobody alive in there."  Which is the truth, Witness? 
A.	Prosecutor, to tell you the truth, I know fully well that it is difficult to interpret from Kinyarwanda to French.  I know that even when I was at the public prosecutor's office in Kibuye I never said that there were people still alive in the church.  I did say that there were people who had been killed.  Those who were supervising the killings were standing close to the church.  They were the ones pointing out where people were and the parts of the church that had to be demolished so as to bury those who were inside.  I never said before this Court -- make any such assessment before this Court.  Thank you.  
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour.  Is this an appropriate time to take the morning break?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  If I understood you correctly, you do not intend to tender into evidence this document dated 19th April 1995?  
MR. MOSES:
I was planning to do that at the end of his -- end of the cross-examination, Your Honour, but I'm happy to do that.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If you are done with this document, which you have just used, we shall give this document back to you.  

Court is adjourned for a few minutes.  Thank you. 
(Court recessed from 1110H to 1135H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is back in session.  

Prosecutor, could you please proceed with the cross.
MR. MOSES:
Thank you.
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, I now want to move on to the ICTR statements that you gave.  And I want to hand to you two documents, which I'll ask Mr. Registrar to -- 

Now, Witness, I'd ask you to look at the top document, which is the one dated the 27th of July 2000.  First of all, do you recognise your signature down the bottom left-hand side of the page there, on pages one, two, three, four, five, six and seven?
A.	Yes, it is my signature. 
Q.	And on the last page it's also -- your signature appears under a statement in Kinyarwanda and also under the certificate of interpretation; correct?
A.	I see my name appearing there, Anastase Nkinamubanzi, and I recognise the signature. 
Q.	And this was the statement you gave to the investigators of the Tribunal on the 27th of July 2000, isn't it?
A.	I do admit having met the investigators on the 27th of July 2000.  Well, if you wish, you may ask me questions regarding the interview that I had with them and I will answer.  
Q.	Well, first of all, can I get you to confirm that once the statement was taken, it was read back to you, it was translated from French to Kinyarwanda, and you then signed it as being true and correct, didn't you?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours and the Prosecutor, occasionally the investigators would appear, record a statement, and then would not ask you to sign.  Then, subsequently, some investigator would appear and tell you that he works for the ICTR, maybe remind you that you met this or that person, mentioning the name of the person, and stating the date, and when you say "yes", he would then ask you to sign the statement, but the said statement is not reread to you -- or, read back to you.  It was not for us to put questions to him since they were there with their interpreters -- or, the interpreters given to them by the officials who established the contact, as it were, between us and the investigators.  So our main concern was to find out whether these were, indeed, interpreters or investigators of the ICTR. 
Q.	Witness, listen carefully.  I'm talking about this statement.  This statement was translated to you, wasn't it, and there was a certificate signed not only by the interpreter, but also by you on page 7 of that document?  And I'll have the fourth paragraph of that --
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I would ask the Prosecutor to ask me questions on those documents and I'll answer.  
Q.	I am asking you a question, Witness.  You signed that statement, as having been translated to you and it being a true and accurate translation, and you were happy with the translation, and you signed the last page of that statement accordingly.  Are you looking at the right document, Witness?  It is K0144169.
A.	Yes, I'm there. 
Q.	Do you see the certificate of interpretation halfway down the page, Witness? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And it's your signature alongside the bottom right-hand part of that box, isn't it, Witness?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you were acknowledging that that statement -- I'm not talking about any other statement, I'm talking about that statement -- was translated to you and you were happy with the contents contained in the statement as being true and correct, weren't you?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, when the ICTR investigators appear before you, they do not translate the contents of the statements; they are drafted either in French or English because that is the language used by the investigators.  You will notice that there is no cosigning of these types of documents.  So I'm wondering why the investigators would draft their own document in Kinyarwanda, why was the statement not cosigned in Kinyarwanda also?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Proceed, Prosecutor.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	You agree that the investigators had a Kinyarwanda interpreter with them, do you?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And on that occasion it was Jean Marie Gatabazi who was the interpreter, wasn't it?
A.	That's correct.  I remember that individual. 
Q.	And that individual has certified that they translated the document from French to Kinyarwanda in your presence; that's correct too, isn't it?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, that individual by the name of Gatabazi interpreted into English or into French.  I would speak to him in Kinyarwanda, but the documents were prepared in the language spoken by the white who interviewed me.  And I felt that upon appearing before the ICTR I would then speak the truth.  And a document drafted in Kinyarwanda was not shown to me.  You could see this space in -- on this page.  Anything can be put in there, and so I'm wondering why you're dwelling on this particular page, Prosecutor.  
Q.	Because, Witness, it contains your signature as accepting that that document was translated to you and it was true and correct.  And that's what happened, isn't it? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, the investigator who came with Gatabazi -- I do remember, by the way, that it was the very first statement that I made to the investigators of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.  When he came, there were copies that he brought from Kigali.  His purpose was to interview us on Seromba alone.  I do remember some of my companions who were interviewed on Seromba alone.  The investigator didn't want us to speak freely; he just wanted us to talk about Seromba.  He put his questions in the language that he spoke and Gatabazi would interpret into Kinyarwanda.  So I don't know why this document is not drafted into Kinyarwanda from the first to the last page.  However, I do recognise that I did put my signature on this document.  
Q.	All right.  And then, again, in 2002, 4th April, you were shown a statement which was produced as a Defence exhibit yesterday and I -- I apologise for not having the number.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
D. 80, Prosecutor.  
MR. MOSES:
Thank you.  

Show the witness.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And on page 4 of that statement, you will see your signature, once again, underneath the Kinyarwanda box.  
A.	That's correct, I can see my signature, Prosecutor.  
Q.	And, once again, in the box for the certificate of interpretation, your signature appears down there as well, doesn't it, on page 4?  
A.	That's correct, I can see my signature. 
Q.	And not only that, you -- it was a different interpreter that time, wasn't it, it was a Richard Kayanga, who translated -- who was interpreting on that occasion.
A.	Prosecutor, I notice you know the names of the interpreters.  I'm not going to change their names.  But I also wish to tell you that the interpreter has a purpose.  He's not interpreting in the interest of the Accused or of the detainee.  He has his employer who's asked him to come along to interpret.  If the Prosecutor comes to ask you to bring charges or to make some allegations against some people -- we do not trust the interpreters.  
Q.	It's your signature there, isn't it, Witness, and every page of that statement?
A.	Prosecutor, I have not denied that I signed this document.  There could be a thousand or more.  The main thing, as far as I'm concerned, is to use the document to ascertain the truth as it appears in this document.  As for my -- the agreement that I had with you, with the Prosecutor, if I saw that I was misled, I can change my mind.  Even in countries, after they signed agreements, they can change their minds. 
Q.	Looking at page 3 of that document dated 2002, the third paragraph, also -- in the French beginning with the words "Après avoir".  And I'll read out the sentence on page 3, Witness.  It reads:  "After listening to the interpretation of my statement of July 2000 by the interpreter Richard Kayonga on 4 April 2002, I did not make changes." 

Now, Witness, do you agree that in April 2002 you had that previous statement of July 2000 read out to you again, and that you didn't make any changes to it? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I want to tell you the whole truth so that you can make the required amendments.  The documents that the investigators have come from the public prosecutor's office, that is, even if you have changes to make, that investigator will not agree to insert such changes, and that's why occasionally you will tell him to correct some statements and he doesn't do it.  He refuses to do so.  I did face a serious problem.  People of the MRND are the ones who made me engage in this despicable conduct.  And when you are before the investigators, they want to compel you, they want to force you to do things.  You don't know who to plead to.  Occasionally, your life may be at risk.  Occasionally, you may be required to opt for something.  Is it of -- obeying the laws of man?  You would prefer to obey the laws of God by telling the truth.  All these people who wanted me to tell lies, I decided that I will no longer listen to them.  I prefer to be on the side of truth so that I can enjoy an eternal life. 
Q.	So it is your evidence that if you asked for changes to be made they wouldn't make any such changes; is that right?  You don't need to look at the moment, Witness.  Do you agree that's your evidence that they -- the investigators wouldn't make any changes if you asked them to?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, when investigators come -- and let me repeat what I just said.  We don't have any particular relation with them.  Sometimes when you refuse to talk to them they go, and look for the Prosecutor who's going to compel you to speak.  And the Prosecutor is going to tell you, "You got to speak.  Come with me."  And so -- most times this didn't happen to me, but some of my colleagues did have that experience.  Sometimes the prosecutor will come, the very first time, he will compel you -- or, force you to tell lies.  And, for instance, if you have been saved -- if salvation has come into your heart, you tell the prosecutor that you don't want to tell lies anymore, and the prosecutor doesn't understand.  And sometimes, when he appears before the police -- the public prosecutor's office, or before the judiciary, or courts in Rwanda, it's not easy to change your mind.  And even in this Court, some witnesses who appear, they change their minds because they are able to speak freely and willingly because they don't run any risk.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, let me remind you again to try and answer in a specific manner and to avoid digressing.  If you feel that you've already explained a particular point, you've already addressed a particular problem, you don't need to go back on it because it is already on the record.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.  I am bound to repeat myself sometimes and to provide lengthy answers because what I have noticed is that I'm asked the same question two or three times, so I have the feeling that I was not understood, and that's why I engage in such lengthy replies.  Now, I have understood.  I agree with you.  I will attempt to be brief in my answers.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	You can hand that document back.  And I'd ask you to look at the document I'm just going to have shown to you.  What I'm going to show you now, Witness, is that same statement from April 2002 was reconfirmed on the 11th of February 2003.  Do you remember how investigators and an interpreter came back and reread that entire statement and you signed it again down at the bottom left-hand page of each page?
A.	Yes, I do recognise my signature on the different pages of this document on the 4th of February -- on the 4th of April, rather.  I have in my possession the document dated 4th April 2002.  Let me specify that when the said document was established, I was in Gitarama.  
Q.	Witness, if you look at the bottom left-hand side of each page you will also see your signature, not only dated the 4th of April, but also the 11th of February, 11/2/003 (sic); correct?
A.	Yes, indeed, I do see those dates. 
Q.	And it was reread out to you, yet again, for you to make changes, wasn't it?
A.	I thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  With regard to this document established after my arrival at the Gitarama prison, on the said date, the investigators came back to me with this document, a lady and a Canadian -- who was a Canadian investigator.  I remember having met with her.  And when we read -- when the document was read back to me, I asked her to stop reading it first to be able to converse with one another.  I explained to her that when we would meet with the investigators of the ICTR, it was different from when we meet with national authorities, and I asked her that the name of Father Seromba be deleted from the document because he had never ordered me to destroy the church.  The investigator then told me that she was not in a position to amend the document and that whoever had interviewed me, in the first instance, was the person who could amend or expunge the name of Father Seromba from the original document.  
Q.	A couple of points on that:  Firstly, if you look at page 5, do you note that there was an alteration made to the document in the margin?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I do see that the alteration made to the document has to do with the name of an individual which I had forgotten to mention.  So on that occasion, I said that that person was responsible for everything that had happened.  So I did make this alteration.  And I don't think there's any problem with that.  
Q.	You say it was a woman who reconfirmed the statement?
A.	Yes, I do believe -- my apologies.  In Gitarama, it was not only a lady, there was also another investigator, a man who had come to Rwanda before to carry out investigations.  So he came along with the lady I mentioned and, as you can see, when you are making mistakes I can also provide guidance to you which proves I have come here to tell the truth.  I remember having told them that I was not ready to tell lies on anybody.  So on that occasion there were two investigators. 
Q.	Now, I want to show you a document, Witness.  This is an internal memorandum from the Office of the Prosecutor, which records that the investigators who confirmed -- reconfirmed the statement were one Pierre Duclos and another Patrick Oudet, neither of whom, I can assure you, are women.  Might you be mistaken? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I believe I am not mistaken.  When I was transferred from the Kibuye prison to the Gitarama prison, I believe I was interviewed by a man who was accompanied by a woman, and she explained to me that she was Canadian.  When she read my file, she was wondering why Rwandan jurisdictions had not received my confession, my guilty plea.  So I can assure you that when I was at the public prosecutor's office, I was interviewed by both a man and a woman in Gitarama.  
Q.	All right.  I now want to take you to the statement and what is recorded there.  Can I first ask you, please, to look at the original statement of 27 July 2000.  The passage I'm going to be referring to, in the French, starts at the top of page 5, with the words "Jai constaté" and, in the English, it is on page 6, the third paragraph commencing the words, "I noticed".  I want to read what is being recorded that you've said on three occasions, Witness, and ask for your comments.  I want to go through it bit by bit to see whether or not you remember saying these things and whether they are true.  

"I noticed the presence of several authorities who were watching this macabre scene.  Among them I noticed the following:  Ndungutse, a teacher; IPJ, Kayishema; Joseph Habiyambere; Grégoire Ndahimana; Védaste Mupenda; and Father Seromba."  

Now, that's what you told the ICTR investigators, isn't it?  Yes or no, did you tell them that?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I note that mention is made of the authorities -- or, the officials who were present on the site of the church when it was destroyed.  He is right.  But I would like to specify that on that occasion, Seromba was in his home.  He had been attacked.  But he had left his home.  And I believe this is what you want to lead me to.  
Q.	Witness, I'm going to keep on asking the questions.  My question wasn't where was Seromba.  My question was simply:  Is that what you told the ICTR investigators, yes or no?  It is a simple question.
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, yes, indeed, I recognise having said such a thing.  
Q.	We'll move on.  "I was able to recognise these people thanks to Rindiro, the watchman, who told me the names of those I did not know.  I knew Father Seromba before because he used to bring his Suzuki vehicle for repair at the Astalde depot."  Is that statement true?  And did you say it to the investigators of the ICTR? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, the truth has to be told.  And you should be made to understand that most of the statements we made, we made because we were coerced in to doing so.  I am not the only one to have made such statements, but I would like to specify that Seromba never used a Suzuki vehicle.  I do know that Seromba never came to Astalde to have his vehicle repaired.  I do know that a plan was hatched and that the authorities wanted us to say a number of things, so when you are under duress you accept everything that is proposed to you.  
Q.	So you consider that quite a damming statement, did you, that Father Seromba used to get his vehicle repaired?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I know that I was urged by you to be as brief as possible whenever a question was put to me.  In order to tell the truth, I shall try to do so.  Let me tell you that Seromba never came to Astalde to have his vehicle repaired and, besides, no vehicle of the presbytery was ever sent to Astalde for repairs. 
Q.	Let's move on.  It goes on to say:  "When I finished clearing the bodies, assistant bourgmestre, Védaste Mupenda, called me by my first name.  I went towards him.  And I heard him say, 'Now that the cleaning is over, go ahead with your job and demolish the church.'  I replied and I repeated it three times, at the top of my voice, that, 'It is impossible for me to destroy the house of God.  I cannot do that.'"  Now, is that what happened, Witness, and is that what you told the ICTR investigators?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I am not denying what occurred, but one has to say what, indeed, occurred.  When I am mentioning Kayishema and Mupenda, I believe there is a contradiction.  Yes, Mupenda called me, and I went towards the church.  When I got there, I found Fulgence Kayishema.  Kayishema was the first person who had ordered the church to be demolished.  He was a very influential member.  While we were there, he left, and it is Rushema who stayed on site.  I know that when interpretation is provided, the interpretation is not necessarily faithful.  The interpretation provided contains some of the material which I've mentioned.  I told you that when I refused to demolish the church, someone tried to throw two sticks linked by a chain on me, and it is at that moment that Rushema told me, "Why refuse the order?  You should execute the order."  So it is not the person's whose name you mentioned who said those words.  So this has to be clear.  
Q.	Well, it's not who I mentioned, Witness.  This is your statement.  It is who you mentioned, isn't it?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I would like, at this stage, provide some explanations to the Prosecutor.  It was not Mupenda who gave the order to destroy the church.  I believe it is the interpreter who made a mistake.  The person who gave the order was Fulgence Kayishema, and then it was Rushema.  So this is what I can say before this Chamber.  
Q.	Moving on to what is recorded, Witness.  You say:  "Noticing that I had refused, Mupende, Kayishema and Ndahimana and the gendarmes, went to the presbytery and came back with Father Seromba walking ahead of the group.  He came directly to me and said" -- Rwandan words literally translated -- "'It has been decided that indeed has to be destroyed.  We shall build another one.'"  Now, firstly, is that what you said to the ICTR investigators?  Not what you have -- not the account that you've given in Court in the last few days, but is that what you told the ICTR investigators?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I would like to seize the opportunity I am given today to rectify whatever is contained in this document, and so that instead of telling lies, I might be able to tell the truth.  Seromba never gave the order to destroy the church, and that another one would be built.  One has to take into account what had occurred or what had been said on the 13th of April 1994.  As I told you before, when investigators are in front of you, they come with documents established by the Rwandan authorities -- 
Q.	No (Microphones overlapping)
A.	-- and they submit all these lies to you and ask you to confirm them. 
Q.	My question was a simple one and you are not answering it.  We are going to be here for far too long if you don't answer my question.  My question was simply:  Is that what you said to the ICTR investigators, yes or no?  It is not a difficult question.
A.	On the matter of Seromba having given me the order to destroy the church, I would like this to be rectified once and for all.  Seromba never gave me such an order. 
Q.	Did you tell the ICTR investigators that Seromba did give you the order? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I believe I explained that when investigators come to you they have one objective, regardless of the explanations you provide on the way things occurred.  They do not believe you.  I specified that Kayishema was the one who gave me the order to destroy and not Father Seromba.  I said a thousand times that Kayishema was the one who gave me the order to destroy the church and not Father Seromba. 
Q.	So you're saying that what is recorded there is not what you told the investigators in 2000 and read back to you in 2000 and 2003? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I stated that the investigators first went through the public prosecutor's office, and that the public prosecutor's office has its own objectives.  So you cannot afford to deny whatever the public prosecutor's office says.  Sometimes the documents the investigators have have been provided to them by the public prosecutor's office.  I do know that this document was, perhaps, based on the document which was drafted when I was being tortured, but once I decided to draft my own confession, I asked that all this be changed so that the person who indeed ordered the church to be demolished be known.  
Q.	Just by the by, would you agree with me, Witness, that the authorities that you have mentioned, and we'll put to one side Seromba at the moment, but that they were powerful and that they were giving orders?  Would you agree with that?  
A.	I thank you, Madam President, Your Honours, Mr. Prosecutor.  The people who appear in the document, the officials you've just mentioned, were prominent people.  They could give an order, and the order was to be executed.  
Q.	So, in your opinion, Witness, for there to be any suggestion that the authorities were overwhelmed by the circumstances is complete nonsense.  They were in control and they were ordering what was going on, weren't they? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, the question put to me by the Prosecutor is quite interesting.  I would like to answer it in a satisfactory manner.  The officials were not overwhelmed.  They were the ones giving orders.  Weapons had been issued to the reserve officers by the same authorities, which means that the officials were not overwhelmed by the circumstances at all and never prevented anybody from demolishing the church.  If, for example, a policeman was on the site and did not even try to shoot at a person who was attempting to demolish the church, how could such a policeman pretend he had been overwhelmed by circumstances?  That was certainly not the case.  
Q.	Right.  One final passage from this document and then we'll leave it.  
MR. MOSES:
And for the French booth, it is also on page 5, approximately halfway down, there is a sentence commencing "Après avoir terminé".  And, in the English, it is on page 7, and it commences, "When I was" in the first paragraph, about two thirds of the way down, in the first paragraph, the sentence commencing, "When I was through". 
BY MR. MOSES
Q.	I want to read this for you, Witness, and ask you -- whether this is what you told the ICTR investigators:  

"When I was through with the second aperture on the right-hand side of the wall near the tower, I stopped the engine, for I thought I had done enough demolition to the church.  Father Seromba came to me and said" -- and there are some Kinyarwanda words there which mean -- "Destroy all those walls.  Nothing must be left standing.  And I handed over the seat to Morris to continue with the demolition."  

Once again, my question is not to have a lengthy explanation of what did happen.  My question is, Witness:  Is that what you said to the ICTR investigators?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, as you can see, the person who was interpreting did not do so correctly.  You are talking about the second aperture.  I believe this did not occur after the church was demolished.  After the church was destroyed, the bodies were piled up into lorries and was sent to another location where they were buried.  So the episode which is mentioned in this excerpt did not take place at that time.  
Q.	So when did Father Seromba tell you to destroy all the walls and that nothing must be left standing, Witness, if it wasn't at that time?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, before I answer this question, I would like the Prosecutor to understand that when we made the second aperture, it was not -- or, rather, the Prosecutor should understand that it is not at that time that the second aperture was made.  Madam President, Your Honours, Father Seromba never gave me the order to destroy the church.  
MR. MOSES:
Your Honours, perhaps we can break there.  If I can give an indication, I except to be complete by the afternoon break.  I only have one more document to put to the witness, and then some more general questions, but I expect to be complete by the afternoon break if that assists the organisation in terms of getting any other witness here.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecutor.  We shall now break for lunch.  Mr. Witness, we shall resume at 2:30, at which time you will be questioned by the Prosecutor in cross-examination.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  I shall be ready at the said time.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court stands adjourned. 
(Court recessed from 1237H to 1437H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The session now resumes.  Good afternoon, everyone.  

Prosecutor, can you proceed with the cross examination.  
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, this morning you referred to the -- in one of your answers to the fact that you had written to the supreme court of Rwanda regarding your case and that you said you hadn't heard back regarding that.  Do you remember saying that?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, Prosecutor, I believe I spoke to you about this matter.  I believe I gave you adequate information with respect to my -- or, that application.  
Q.	All right.  Well, what I want to show you is a copy of the letter that you wrote to the appeals court on the 7th of November 2001.  
MR. MOSES:
And I have translations of that in French and English and I have provided a French copy and the Kinyarwanda to my learned friend.  

MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Monthé.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
I merely, for clarity on the record, 7 November 2001 is not sent to the appeals court, but rather to the supreme court.  Prosecutor talked of the court of appeal.  I heard court of appeal.  So let's be specific with respect to this document.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecutor, maybe you should clarify.  
MR. MOSES:
To be honest, I can't remember what I said now, Your Honours.  I thought I had said the supreme court, but I may not have.  And I apologise if I had done that.  It is a letter, that my friend quite rightly points out, is sent to the supreme court in Kigali.  And, as indicated, I have copies for, Your Honours, in French and in English.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	All right.  Now, Witness, do you recognise that as a letter that was sent to you by the supreme court on the 7th of November 2001?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I told you that this letter was not received by the supreme court.  We only saw a circular.  This tributed (sic) to all the prison yards in Rwanda.  I'm not saying that we should not make reference to this letter.  And if the letter was not received by the supreme court, I now wonder why the Prosecutor is relying on the letter, unless he can produce some document to testify to the fact that this letter was received by the supreme court.  
Q.	Witness, that's the letter you wrote though, isn't it?  Whether it was received or not, do you accept that that's what you wrote?  It is a letter, in fact, you gave to the Prosecutors when they visited you in Gitarama prison.  That's what you gave them, a copy of what you had sent.
A.	Prosecutor, let me tell you that an investigator who came to see me at Gitarama and to whom I showed this letter that I had sent to the supreme court -- I explained to him that I could no longer -- I could no longer be a witness for the Prosecution because the supreme court had not accepted my letter and did not agree with what I had said; in other words, that I had been compelled to say what I had said, and that there would not be any mitigation of my sentence.  So that letter was not received.  And if the Rwandan authorities didn't want to receive that letter and did not want to rely on it -- I don't know why you're insisting on it, except you would want this Court to get in touch with the Rwandan authorities, so that my judgement can be considered, otherwise I'm not prepared to dwell on this letter. 
Q.	Witness, if you just concentrate on the question.  Don't worry too much about why questions are being asked.  If you simply answer the questions, and I think you, in the course of your answer, did accept that this is, in fact, a letter that you sent to the supreme court; that's correct, isn't it? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I did not deny that I sent this letter to the supreme court.  But the supreme court didn't want to rely on it.  And so this letter, my letter was not received.  
Q.	All right.  But this is a letter that you -- you wrote.  It's not one that was drafted by the Rwandan authorities or the ICTR.  It is something that you wrote, isn't it?
A.	Prosecutor, let me tell you, I'm not denying that I wrote this letter.  I merely wish to state that those to whom I address the letter didn't want to rely on it.  They did not deem it admissible.  If it had been deemed admissible, one could lend credence to it.  
Q.	All right.  Well, listen, let's -- let's --
A.	The issue is one of ascertaining why they did not want to rely on it.  I don't know why the Prosecutor would want to use it.  
Q.	Well, let's have a look alt what you said to the supreme court of Rwanda about the events at Nyange church, shall we.  
MR. MOSES:
And for the Kinyarwanda interpreters, hopefully you have the French version with you as well.  In the French version, I'm looking at page 2, the very first paragraph which commences "Lors de ma défense", and going down five lines to "la première".  

I believe in the Kinyarwanda version it commences -- there's a heading a third of the way down the first page, and then four lines down, in that following paragraph, with words "nyuma yol" (phonetic) a sentence starting there.  

And for the English, it is also page 2, the first paragraph.  And I want to read you what you wrote, not what the IPJ, or what the ICTR investigators wrote, but what you wrote.  It says:  

"After the presentation of my defence, it became clear that I could not be held responsible for their massacre.  The truth admitted before the court in which I still stand by up to today, is that I demolished the church with a bulldozer in execution of the order issued by the commune and church leaders at the time."  Now, that's what you wrote, with your own words, to the supreme court of Rwanda; is that correct, or did you lie to the supreme court of Rwanda?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, your question was to find out if I had lied to the supreme court.  In answer, I would like to say to you that there was an officer of the supreme court who came and told us that the letter that we sent to the supreme court had not been received, so I do not know why you want to rely on a document that was not even received by the Rwandan authorities.  I do not agree to engage in any discussion based on this letter unless I'm shown some document indicating that this letter was received.  I don't think you should rely on this document unless you produce a document to indicate that that -- this document was received.  In that case, I would be prepared to discuss this letter.  My application was not entertained.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You can proceed, Mr.  Prosecutor.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, the reason why this is an important letter is because, you see, you have said you had been tortured, threatened, coerced into making all sorts of statements, and this is one you've written yourself.  And in it you said you demolished the church in execution of an order issued by commune and church leaders at the time.  I want to know whether that is what you had written there, in your own writing, is true?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I believe I told you that each time I intended to write any letter whatsoever regarding what happened, well, this was not allowed for as long as I did not mention the name that was suggested to me.  Once again, let me state that if somebody should use this letter, that person would also have to produce a letter or a document indicating that the letter was received.  And if you ever had approached the judicial authorities, I believe you might have asked them to also show a document indicating that this letter was admitted.  You want to entrap me.  If you don't have the document to indicate that this letter was received, otherwise I won't be ready to engage in any discussion with respect to this application. 
Q.	Witness, can I make it quite clear, it doesn't concern me one way or the other whether the document was received or not.  My concern is that you have acknowledged properly that it is your document.  And I want to ask you questions about your document.  All right.  

My next question is regarding the following sentence to the one which has just been read out to you.  And it says here:  "However, there were no living persons inside the church at that moment."   

Now, Witness, that's what you wrote in the letter which was sent, whether it was received or not, that's what you wrote to the supreme court of Rwanda.  Yet, today in Court you've said that there definitely were people alive in the church and you saw them.  How are you able to explain the fact that you've written something completely different in this document?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I don't think there is a contradiction.  The Prosecutor is relying on the fact that this letter was written by myself but, as I have asked, Madam President, and I believe -- I have explained that I'm not prepared to engage in any discussions on this letter because the supreme court of Rwanda and the Rwandan authorities were not prepared to admit or receive this application.  I'm not prepared to discuss a matter that has not even been received by the authorities.  When you forward a request to someone, and that person provides no answer, that means that person does not attach any importance to what you've said.  And, again, this document was made available to you by the public prosecutor's office, and I don't know why the public prosecutor's office did not also give me a document, according to which or indicating that this letter was received.  This application was rejected by the supreme court, so I cannot rely on it.  I don't attach any importance to it. 
Q.	Isn't the reason you're not prepared to discuss this letter, Witness, the fact that it shows that you've not been telling the truth in Court?  
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I see that the Prosecutor is pointing an accusing finger at me.  I have already told you that this document was not received by the Rwandan authorities.  They are the ones who gave you this document.  Now, how can you rely on a document which, even the authorities of our country fail to attach any importance.  I don't think you should unduly delay or dwell on it, otherwise you can refer to the person who gave you this letter and ask whether my application was received or not, and in that way we can discuss.  
Q.	If that's your answer, Witness, I'm going to move on and see what you have to say about other passages in the document.  
MR. MOSES:
I'm referring to the French, page 2, paragraph 3, which commences "C'est le jour suivant"; and page 2, third paragraph of the English on 15 April 1994; and, for the Kinyarwanda booth, it's -- there's a sentence beginning "buke ye bwa" (phonetic), which is about six lines beneath the end of the passage which we've just -- had translated. 
(Pages 16 to 30 by Roxane Meena)




















1500H 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	This is also what you also wrote, Witness.  "On 15th April, 1994, they held me and my friend 
	Everiste Ntahokiriye, We were at Kimbari, Byumba, we were brought in and ordered us to destroy the church, but we refused.  Immediately they killed him, my friend on the spot.  Having witnessed that, I felt weak and carried out their orders.  They just had Father Seromba brought in, and later informed us that that was the decision that had been taken".  That's what you wrote in November 2001, yourself, isn't it? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, this time around I notice that the Prosecutor is trying to say that the church was demolished on the 15th.  I don't agree with you.  You will need to check your documents.  I know that a lot of witnesses have testified with respect to the demolition of the church.  Well, then in that way we can discuss and determine the date on which the church was demolished. 
Q.	Are you refusing to answer my question, Witness? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I believe I have not refused to answer the Prosecution's questions.  I answered his questions as I understand them.  If you haven't understood the answer, I have given, you can put the question to me again and I will answer it and then we can proceed. 
Q.	We just had a passage from your letter read out and translated.  My question to you was -- which I didn't get an answer, was, is that what you wrote to the supreme court of Rwanda? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I would request the Prosecutor to read out to me again the passage he is referring to and then I will answer his question.  This shouldn't take too much time. 
Q.	"On the 15th April 1994, they had me and my friend Everiste Ntahokiriye -- Kigali, Byumba brought in order to destroy the church but we refused.  Immediately they killed him, my friend, on the spot.  Having witnessed that, I felt weak and carried out their orders.  They just had Father Seromba brought in, and later informed us that that was the decision that had been taken".  You can find that in the document in front of you, also, Witness, your document? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I see that reference is being made to the date of 15th April 1994, in this document.  I am wondering whether that is indeed the date.  If you persist in saying that it was the 15th, I would like to correct it and say that it was on 16thth.  I went to Nyange church on the 16th of April.  My colleague Everiste was killed there on the 16th of April and not on the 15th, I would therefore invite the Prosecutor to make that correction. 
Q.	Well, subject to that correction, do you agree that what is being read out is what you wrote to the Supreme Court?  It's a question? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, if the Prosecutor agrees that it was not on that date, I have told you that when someone wrote a letter at that time without mentioning the names that had been suggested to you, the letter wouldn't be accepted.  That was the rule during that period.  The situation has changed but at the time that wasn't the case.  Your letter could not be approved by the Prosecutor or approved by the Prosecutor if the letter did not contain the names that were suggested to you. 
Q.	Oh, I still don't have an answer to my question, Witness.  Do you agree that you wrote that letter which is being read out, yes or no? 
A.	Prosecutor, I am the person who wrote it.  I was assisted by someone else.  I have pointed out to you that an error was made and I would like that error to be corrected. 
Q.	That's all I wanted, Witness, that you had written it.  We didn't need all those explanations I just wanted to know that you had written it.  Similarly, I want to ask the next paragraph in the French and English to be read out.  The following word in the Kinyarwandan version.  It says:  "The decision was taken at the meeting held on the 19th April l994.  Furthermore, Father Edouard Nturiye and Francios Kayiranga, they had confessed that they had attended the meeting.  This proves that I did not participate in the incident which occurred before 15th April.  I was, therefore, surprised to learn that the court of appeal had acquainted the priest who had taken the decision to destroy the church at their meeting and I, who was forced to demolish the church got life imprisonment".  

Now, once again, Witness, a simple question, all I am wanting you to confirm or deny is that, that's what was recorded in your letter sent to the Supreme Court? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, with your leave, I would like to explain what happened because I have been asked to be brief.  Regarding the matter concerning Nturiye and Kayiraga, they admitted that they attended the meeting but that meeting was aimed at or the purpose of that meeting was to prepare for the burial of bodies.  The bourgmestre was there and he said that he had to go and get drivers who would help bury the bodies.  What I was trying to explain was that during the Trial of both priests, the circumstances under which bulldozers were brought to the church were explained.  But if I put myself in the place of the priest, I would act in the same manner.  The priest could not have buried the bodies without the assistance of communal authorities. 
Q.	I am going to ask the question again.  "They, therefore, used the bulldozers to bury the bodies and demolish the church".  The passage that was read out to you is that what was recorded in your letter to the Supreme Court?  Yes or no?" 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I have admitted to having written this letter but I say that my request was not admitted before Rwandan courts.  Why does the Prosecutor continue to rely on this document?  In my opinion -- in my opinion this document has no value.  You are coercing me -- you are bringing pressure to bear on me.  Just like when you appear before Rwandan courts, I believe there is also the form of coercion. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, I believe you are appearing before a Court that doesn't allow coercion.  Questions are being put you, but you are not answering them.  There's no coercion here.  Have you understood what I have said?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours, I have made this statement because up until now the Prosecutor is trying to force me to give explanations on a document that was rejected by the Rwandan court.  I would like to point out that the Prosecutor is continuing to ask me to provide explanations on this document.  If the Rwandan courts had accepted that I acted under coercion, I wouldn't have had any problems before the Rwandan courts.  Madam President, I don't mean to say that you are forcing me to give explanations but I would like to tell you that the document on which the Prosecutor wants me to make remarks has been or was rejected by the Rwandan courts. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, you said this, and I repeat and on each occasion it was placed on record.  What you have said had been noted. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.  Thank you for understanding that Rwandan courts did not attach any importance to this document.  Now the Prosecutor can proceed to put questions to me.  Mr. Prosecutor, please proceed. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	In the same later you outlined what you -- or described as a serious (inaudible) arguments -- 
MR. MOSES: 
And item 2.3 at the bottom of page 3 of the French version of the statement, Your Honours, 2.3.  And in the English it's at page 3 under the heading, "Serious (inaudible) arguments, No. 3."  And in the Kinyarwanda, it's on page 2.  It's item 2. 3. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	This is what you wrote, Witness, to the Supreme Court.  "The Court did not pay any attention to the statements made by the Prosecution witness who testified that he saw IPJ, Kayishema, when he brought me and forced me to demolish the church.  I refused to comply until the arrival of 
	Father Seromba.  After that the church was destroyed".  Do you agree, Witness that that's in complete contradiction to the evidence you have given to this Court in the last few days in the course of your testimony? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, regarding this paragraph, I believe the sentence is very clear.  Perhaps it isn't clear enough because it is someone else who helped me to write this document.  In reading this document I should point out that Father Seromba arrived on the scene but he did not issue orders that the church be destroyed.  It should be pointed out that he arrived later.  What I am saying is that Father Seromba resided in Nyange parish.  You should bear in mind that when you prepare a document like this, and the receivers of this document do not find the name, they are looking for in the document, they reject your application.  However, since I am able to appear before this court and Father Seromba is here, present I would like to tell the Chamber that Father Seromba played no role in the destruction of the church.  He was attacked by all those communal authorities.  I continue to say that if a person wishes to be released, he must mention in the document he is preparing the names of persons that the authorities are looking for. 
Q.	I am sorry, to suggest otherwise, Witness, but we have heard a good deal of evidence in this trial about the trial in the appeal of Fathers Nturiye and Kayiraga, who neither of whom it appears implicated in a great extent Father Seromba and they were acquitted on appeal, weren't they.  This tends to undermine totally what you are suggesting to this trial court and the only way that an appeal would be entertained is if you implicate or you are going to implicate Father Seromba? 
A.	Thank you, the Prosecutor has just said something which I find satisfactory.  The Court of appeal indeed acquitted Fathers Nturiye and Kayiraga, who were co-accused with Father Seromba.  If those priests had made any accusations against Father Seromba and were innocent, you should explain this to me very clearly.  If the Court of appeal acquitted Fathers Nturiye and Kayiraga, whereas 
Father Seromba was accused with them, there's no indication whatsoever or nothing written to the effect that Father Seromba went to get attackers to come and destroy the church. 
Q.	All right.  We will move on.  Just a few -- 
A.	Yes, I agree with you, we should proceed. 
Q.	Now, do you agree with me that there was a roadblock at the bottom of the church -- the road leading up to the church? 
A.	I do not deny that that roadblock existed.  That roadblock was there.  I did not work at that roadblock but it was near Kanyasinda but there was another roadblock set up right in the middle of the business centre.  I do agree with you that there were therefore two roadblocks. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, the account that you gave the Court, of Seromba running to where you were on the bulldozer, and then you have described how a person by the name of Makoba presented firearms.  What sort of firearm was this?  Was it a pistol, a riffle? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I do not know whether the Prosecutor properly pronounced the name of that person.  He is Mahoro.  He was carrying a Kalashnikov riffle.  I don't know whether he was the one you are referring to.  He had another weapon.  I don't know what type of weapon it was. 
Q.	What exactly did he do with this weapon? 
A.	That weapon is used and you have to go round in circles. 
Q.	Is it a firearm or some other type of weapon?  The one that goes round in circles? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, it is not a gun.  It is pieces of wood.  Two pieces of wood that are linked by a chain and it is used in circles.  I don't know how you call that kind of weapon.  I see white persons using that weapon, but I do not know its name. 
MR. MOSES: 
All right.  Now just for the record.  Mahoro is it spelt M-A-H-O-R-O? 
A.	Makoro.
Q.	So it that, M-A-K-O-R-O?
A.	Yes, that is, indeed, how it is pronounced. 
Q.	Sorry, did this Makoro have a Kalashnikov in one arm and the other weapon in the other hand? 
A.	Yes, that was the same person who pushed the priest with the butt of his gun. 
Q.	So, he pushed him with the butt of his gun, which part of his body did he push him from?  His chest, his head? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, he hit him with a butt of the gun in the ribs and forced him to turn back and go where he had come from. 
Q.	And this was all in front of everyone standing around the bulldozer?  It was all in open view for everyone to see, according to you? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, this incident occurred in public, before a large crowd.  As I have told you the church was surrounded and a large crowd of assailants had assembled in front of the church. 
Q.	Now you had also referred to words that you say Father Seromba spoke to Rushema.  You didn't need to repeat those words but you agree with me that you had spoken about Father Seromba having, I think grabbed Rushema by the arm and said to him, "I forbid you yesterday to kill people here, and you have just demolished the church".  Is that right? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I said that the priest came immediately and was (inaudible) when he was speaking to Rushema.  It is obvious that he was saddened by the events unfolding in the church. 
Q.	Would you agree with me, Witness, that in all the statements you have made from 1995 up to, including 2004, and 2003, you have never made any accusation or any statement implicating Rushema and being spoken to by Seromba and that the first time you have ever mentioned this was in the statement you gave to the Defence at the end of last year? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I do remember that well before I did say that Rushema was among the attackers and there was no way I could have excluded him or forgotten about him in the documents.  When I was interviewed with respect to my initial statement, I remember having mentioned Rushema's name.  So I am surprised to hear that his name does not appear anywhere.  If by some chance I might have forgotten him in one statement there's no way I could have forgotten him in another one. 
Q.	Well, then, Witness, can I suggest to you that you never mentioned Rushema as having been the -- together with Rushema which never appeared until you gave the statement to the Defence at the end of last year. What do you say to that? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, if I understood him clearly the Prosecutor is saying that I have never mentioned Rushema's name.  I don't agree with him.  Everyone is talking about him including those confessing in Rwanda.  Those appearing before the Gacaca court.  How could I have forgotten him.  If you have a document in which Rushema's name does not appear, that might have been a mistake or an oversight.  I have always mentioned Rushema's name.  If I mentioned his name, it is not because I wanted to accuse him falsely but because I was aware of the crimes that he committed. 
Q.	I am suggesting to you, Witness, that exactly what you are trying to do is falsely accuse and implicate Mr. Rushema on matters which he was not responsible for.  I am not saying he wasn't there.  I am simply saying that you are adding things on now having spoken to the Defence for the first time that's then that you stated to make extra allegations against Mr. Rushema? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I would like to tell you that I didn't start talking about Rushema when I was approached by Seromba's Defence team.  In fact, during my Trial at the specialised Chamber in Kibuye, I always mentioned Rushema's name.  And when he was summoned as a witness, when he was questioned the very first time he denied having been at the church and then subsequently when he agreed to a confession and to enter a guilty plea, he did acknowledge the fact that he did participate in the actual events at Nyange church.  So I am not attributing anything to him that he was not involved in.  He was leading the attack.  I hear you intend to go to Nyange church.  When you get there everybody will talk to you about Rushema. 
Q.	Summarily, Witness, would you agree with me that the first time you have ever mentioned the story of the person, Makoro, having had a gun, pointing at -- pushing, Father Seromba, the first time that has ever been mentioned was in your defence statement given to the Defence last year? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I would like to take you back to the -- I would like to take you back to evidence that is given.  When somebody is engaged in investigation and you try to exculpate the person concerned, the Prosecutor in Rwanda is not interested in what you are saying.  All I want to say is that this is not the first time that I made mention of that incident?  I even told Gregory who is sitting behind you and I also made mention to the lady who was here yesterday.  And I believe I told her that on the 28th of February 2004.  In March and again in 2004, I did make mention of it.  Particularly when I was getting ready to testify here.  So don't try to convince me that I never spoke of Rushema. 
Q.	I will move on to your discussions with the Prosecutors.  The truth of the matter is, Witness that you always confirmed in each and every meeting you had with Prosecutors from the office of the Prosecutor.  That you only commenced the destruction of the church after you had been given the order from Seromba and that that was your account on each and every occasion you spoke with Prosecutors from the office of the Prosecutor.  That is the truth, isn't it? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, the presiding Judge here in the Court asked me to be brief but I would want again to clarify a matter.  Currently, Gacaca court sessions are taking place in Rwandan and the authorities have told us that if by some chance we engaged in giving false testimony or if we had preferred any -- or made any allegations that amounted to lies, during the Gacaca court session that would be the opportunity to correct them so that those court sessions can proceed smoothly.  You said that when I met the Prosecutors of this Tribunal, I told them that Seromba was involved in the demolition of the church?  Well, I want to tell you the truth but you don't want to listen to the truth because when you notice that the truth is exculpating the person, you don't want to listen.  Prosecutor, I think I have always submitted arguments here to point to the fact that Father Seromba was innocent 
Q.	You are not really asking this Trial Chamber to accept, are you witness, that the Office of the Prosecution flew you over here to testify for the Prosecution in the knowledge that you were going to say, that everything you had said in the last ten years was not true, that Father Seromba wasn't involved?  Is that what you are asking the Trial Chamber to accept? 
A.	I thank you, Prosecutor.  Madam President, Your Honours, I think the Prosecutor has just said something quite interesting.  He has just said that I spent ten years making statements.  Let me also tell him that the ten years that have elapsed has assisted us a lot.  It has made it possible for us to witness change.  I am very pleased that I have not died prior to the trial of Father Seromba because if that were going to be the case you were going to rely on these false documents and I am sure that Seromba would not have escaped.  So, Mr. Prosecutor, you have said something quite interesting.  Well, after ten years, we now have the opportunity to tell the truth and that is the truth that I am telling here.  I believe Seromba should not be held liable for what happened at the church.  It is the communal authorities who supervised everything.  Let me thank you, Prosecutor. 
Q.	The truth is that you have never mentioned to any Prosecutor of this Tribunal, this story that you are telling of Makoro, threatening Father Seromba, that's the truth, isn't it? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I felt I had the right not to disclose Makoro's name to the Defence team because the main thing for me was not to talk to the Defence but rather to come here to say what I had to say in other words tell the truth to the Court.  And so, if I didn't mention Makoro's name that could be understood.  You can appear before me and then you say, "Let me make a statement", and I could refuse to make such a statement.  I could say to you, "Let me say what I have to say to the Court".  So this is an opportunity we have to be able to explain everything. 
Q.	As you said in your evidence in-chief, you have been in prison for the last few years with Seromba's brother, haven't you? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, Defence Counsel asked me a question about Seromba's brother, whether I was in detention with that person, I said:  "Yes.  But then, I stated that I got to know that individual when I was coming back from here.  And because there were some detainees or some prisoners who where detained some where else but who has been transferred to Gitarama recently. 
Q.	Come-on, Witness, for heavens sake, you are in prison with the Accused's brother, in Gitarama prison for many years.  You are not clearly suggesting that you didn't know him until you came back from this Court, are you -- or is that your evidence? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, let me inform the Prosecutor that Gitarama prison has more than 8,000 inmates.  He is asking me a question about Seromba who comes from Kibuye préfecture.  I come from Gisenyi préfecture.  So how could I have known all the prisoners who were in Gitarama?  That would be engaging in some futile exercise.  I have never taken the trouble to find out whether there was Seromba's brother detained in Gitarama prison yard.  What benefit would I derive from that?  
Q.	Well, you told other prisoners when you got brought over here in 2004 to testify for the Prosecution that you were being paid to change your earlier testimony from the last nine or ten years, and that all of a sudden you decided you wanted to give your statement in open court, but you weren't given the opportunity were you, witness, because the Prosecution decided not to call you having received that information.  
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I would want the Prosecutor to explain to me what he has just said.  He has asked me -- and he has asked whether I never received monies so as to be able to testify for Father Seromba.  So that money, could it have been given to me by the Office of the Prosecutor or by someone else?  Maybe if you explain to me I would be able to answer your question.  
Q.	I go it more, simply, for you, Witness.  When you were in the detention facility in Arusha, in 2004, you told some of the other detainees that you were being paid to change your story about Seromba's involvement, and that you planned to do so when you were called to testify for the Prosecution. 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours.  I want to say to the Prosecutor that if there's some detainee, some prisoner, who might have told him, the Prosecutor, that monies have been given to me for me to change my testimony that is a lie.  And I would like to answer the question that, Madam President, please allow me to provide some explanation.  While we were here, Gregory came and met a certain witness.  I could even give you his name.  His name is (by order of the Court the name has been extracted and put under separate cover) ).  I was sick and when that witness discussed with the Prosecutor -- 
MR. MOSES: 
(Inaudible)
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Prosecutor, could say what you said because we didn't even hear you. 
MR. MOSES: 
Sorry, Your Honour, I was just wanting the name that was mentioned to be strike from the record.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, not to strike from the record but placed under seal, rather. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
So that name would be placed under seal. 
THE WITNESS: 
So, let me continue, Madam President, Your Honours.  I am not going to mention that name again.  So when that person came, he met me in bed.  And he told me, "I have just said that it was 
	Father Seromba who was supervising you, and who told you that you should act with caution, so that the ramble* does not injure you.  Now when he told me that I didn't continue to discuss with him.  I told him since you want to appear as a driver of the bulldozer, I won't talk to you any more because of the fact that you said you were the bulldozer driver."  And that's when I refused to testify and that's when they started saying that I was somebody who didn't want to tell the truth with respect to Seromba.  And that's when they also started circulating the story that I had taken money in order to testify for 
	Father Seromba.  So, that's what I wanted to tell you, 
Madam President, Your Honours. 
Q.	And at that very same time you signed as you indicated earlier a document indicating that you were happy to give your evidence in open court without any protection.  Isn't that right? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, when I came to Arusha on that date I believe before we were shown where we were going to sit, I was asked whether I could testify as a protected witness.  So, I said:  "No, I wanted to appear not as a protected witness".  Then WVSS told me that it would be submitting the matter to the Trial Chamber.  And so when I came here I signed a document indicating that I would testify in the open.  And I was told:  "If you intend to testify in the open, you will be responsible for your own safety and security."  And I said:  "Well, our protection is not provided by human beings but rather by God.  So that was no concern of mine.  My concern was the opportunity to tell the truth as to what happened". 
Q.	And it wasn't you, who decided you were going to testify for the Prosecution it was the Prosecution who decided that they weren't going to rely on your testimony.  Isn't that the case? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, as I have already explained, on the 25th when I met Gregory, I believe I did not tell him that I was not ready to testify.  What I said was that there was some point about Father Seromba ordering that the church be demolished, that some other church would be built, and that the Hutus were numerous in number.  I wasn't in agreement with him.  So Gregory told me that if that's what I was going to say, I would have to go back to Rwanda.   And it would no longer be necessary for me to be summoned here."  So I said, "Well, that's life."  So, I didn't know whether I was going to appear.  But what I know is that he had told me that when he would be back here in Arusha, he was going to summon me. 
Q.	Witness, you have given us -- the Trial Chamber accounts of torture by the Rwandan authorities, pressure and coercion by the Rwandan judiciary, and judiciary investigations officers. Coercion by African Rights, coercion by the ICTR investigators, false allegation -- well, sorry, that the ICTR investigators and all the interpreters deliberating misconcocted (sic) evidence for you to sign.  That the ICTR Prosecutors wouldn't accept what you had said.  Witness, all these stories and I use the word stories advisedly, are something made up in an attempt by you to explain away the consistent evidence and testimony that you had given over a eight or nine year period, implicating Father Seromba, who did order you to bulldozer the church.  That's the correct situation isn't it? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I think before this Court, I did explain all the problems that I faced, whether it be before the public Prosecutor's office.  The soldiers behind SONARWA*, I believe I did explain everything.   I am here, and I am wondering whether you see me or you view me as someone who has come to tell lies.  I know that you don't have to joke with the court.  I have come here to testify freely.  I am not forced to do so and I am only telling the truth. 
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, this is the end of my cross-examination which I think is just about on time.  I do have some documents which I want to tender.  I don't know whether you want to do that now or after the break.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It will be after the break, Prosecutor.  You would like it to be done in the presence of the witness, isn't it?  It is possible that the Defence may want to re-examine the witness.  We will go on break now.  

The proceedings stand adjourned for a few minutes 
(Court recessed from: 1600H to 1630)
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session.  Mr. Prosecutor, you have the floor. 
MR. MOSES: 
I wish to tender -- the first is the document dated the 19th of April, 1995.  There's an original in Kinyarwanda and a French and in English.  And it would be Prosecution Exhibit 54. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No, objection from the Defence?  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
No objection regarding the document of 19th April, 1995, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, this document dated 19th April, 1995 is admitted as a Prosecution Exhibit under the number 
P.  44.  A, for the Kinyarwanda, B for the French and E (sic) -- and C for the French.
MR. MOSES: 
The English come through, P. 44.  It should be P. 54. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very, well, we want to make the correction.  That is, P 54 and not P. 44. 
(Exhibit No. P. 54 admitted) 
MR. MOSES:  
The next document, Your Honours, is the ICTR statement, dated 27th July 2000, the original was in French and I have an English translation, and that would be Prosecution Exhibit 55. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objection from the Defence?  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
No objection with regard to the document of the 27th of July, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This document dated 27th July 2000 is admitted a Prosecution exhibit.  The exhibit number is P. 55.  A, for the French and B for the English. 
(Exhibit No. P. 55 admitted)
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, the next document is the reconfirmation of the same - the 2002 statement which was reconfirmed on the 11th of February of 2003.  It is only in the original French.  It is basically the same document as the previous one except that it has the initials of the witness on the bottom left hand corner of each page and also the alteration which we referred to in cross-examination.  That would be Prosecution Exhibit 56. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No objection from the Defence? 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, excuse me, I haven't quite understood what the Prosecutor said regarding the document he wants to tender into evidence.  We admitted the document of the 27th of July.  I do not know whether we are talking of the same document or another document. 
MR. MOSES: 
The document of the 27th of July was reconfirmed.  So it was resigned by the witness on a different date. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Was that of 11th February 2003?  There's no problem with the admission of this document? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  This document dated 11th February 2003 is a reconfirmation, therefore, of the document of the 27th of July 2000.  It is admitted as a Prosecution exhibit and the exhibit number is P. 56. 
	(Exhibit No. P. 56 admitted)
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, the last document is the letter of 7th November 2001.   And there's a Kinyarwandan, French and English.  And that would be Prosecution Exhibit 57.  That would be the last document we are going to produce.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Yes, Madam President, regarding the Kinyarwanda version of the text, K0261486.  It's in three pages.  Does he observe that this document is not signed by the witness?  Is it the same document I have?  The last page?  The K-number is 261488.  This document hasn't been signed by the witness.  Agreed?  It is in Kinyarwanda. 
MR. MOSES: 
(Inaudible) the one sent to the Supreme Court. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
No, I do not refute that.  It is a letter dated 7th November 2001.  It is attributed to the witness.  It was sent to the Supreme Court.  But it is not signed by the witness.  Do you agree with me?  Is that the document you want to tender into evidence?  Are we agreed that it is not signed? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, the Prosecutor indeed states that this Kinyarwanda version of the document has not been signed by the witness.  So, there's no objection from the Defence?  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
No objection, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This letter dated 7th November 2001 is admitted as Prosecution exhibit -- and the exhibit number is 
P. 57, A, for the Kinyarwanda, B for the French and C for the English.
(Exhibit Nos. P. 57A, P.57B, and P. 57C admitted) 
Mr. Prosecutor, have you ended your cross-examination? 
MR. MOSES: 
Yes, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecutor.  Is it Counsel Monthé who will re-examine the witness?  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Yes, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, proceed.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Thank you, Madam President. 
RE-EXAMINATION  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, good day.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	Do you feel in proper shape so that I can ask some questions before we adjourn? 
A.	Oh yes, you can ask your questions, I have no problem, and if I have answers to provide to them I will do so. 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, I want to be sure that I clearly understood what you said.  You told the Court when being cross-examined by the Prosecutor that you had appealed against a decision that was rendered in Kibuye sentencing you to life imprisonment and you said your appeal was never forwarded to the Appeals Chamber.  They just came and told you in prison as same as others that your appeal had been rejected or dismissed? 
A.	I was told that I had appealed but that my appeal did not get to Ruhengeri.  I wasn't the only one.  I had said there were many of us.  There were detainees whose appeal was dismissed and I was one of them.  One of those whose appeal had been dismissed.  There were others whose appeal never got to Ruhengeri. 
Q.	I hope I have made myself understood.  Did your appeal not get to Ruhengeri?  In other words, the appeal that you draw up in prison did not get to the Court of Appeal in Ruhengeri or the Court of Appeal dismissed your appeal for being inadmissible for instance.  That is the question or clarification I am seeking? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, no letter got to Ruhengeri and we were surprised at that.  And let me thank you for asking me that question.  The prison officials were not doing their work in the proper manner, and we weren't able to know what happened to the letters that we had written.  I wasn't the only one who faced that problem.  There were very many of us who faced that problem at the Kibuye prison yard. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Thank you, Witness.  If I understood you clearly, you did indeed submit a formal appeal but it wasn't sent by the prison management to the Ruhengeri court of appeal, is that what you are saying? 
A.	Absolutely, the superintendent of the Kibuye prison yard did not forward the Appeals that we had prepared, and the officials were saying that we were Interahamwes.  We were neglected.  We were treated with contempt.  And so we were faced with some sort of a deadlock and of course when the time limit expired, we couldn't raise any questions and even when we sent our files to the 
	Supreme Court, we didn't know how those case files were forwarded there.  We couldn't -- we had no means of checking at what stage they were. 
Q.	Thank you.  Let me ask you one last question on this aspect.  Is the Court to understand that the prison officials deliberately refused to forward your files to the Ruhengeri court of appeal? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I don't think I want to answer that question before this court.  I think it is in Rwanda that this kind of problem should be raised.  When we raise the problem we are told, oh the time limit or the dead line is passed, and so I am raising the issue here so that you know that we were victims of some injustice and when we asked the officials at the prison yard what happened, they tell you be patient. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, at this juncture I would like, with your leave to use the judgment of the Ruhengeri Court of Appeal of the 25th of October 1998 which was tendered as a Defence exhibit under a number which I cannot remember now.  Maybe a memory lapse.  Possibly with the assistance of the registry I would be able to get that number and I would be giving out the pages of concern to me, namely pages 13 and 14, a matter that was discussed at length before this court in previous sessions during the presentation of the Prosecution case.  It was 25th October 2000, please.  25th October 2000.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
D. 21.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Obliged, Madam President.  So, I would like to use that Exhibit D. 21, so that we don't waste too much time.  I am going to ask the registry to take up the photocopies that I have produced and the main documents are in the record of the Tribunal.  Maybe the Court might wish to review it but I have it before me.    But I would like to move straight to using it if you allow me. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  I don't know whether you have photocopies of those pages.  I would also like to have them. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
I was waiting for your permission.  The documents are still with me.  I would want the registry to come and pick them up.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Registry, could you please get those documents from Counsel Monthé. 

MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, Your Honours, I think all the parties to this trial do have the said document.  I will, therefore, now proceed to use it. 
	In the course of the cross-examination by the Prosecutor, he indicated that the witness here, had lodged an appeal and that his appeal had been dismissed by the Ruhengeri Court of Appeal.  Now the witness says that his appeal never reached Ruhengeri.  I would like to draw your attention that in the judgment of the court of appeal, there were a few co-accused.  There was the witness here and several others.  Kasongo, Jean-Francois, Emmanuel Kayiraga, Edouard Nturiye.  Now on page 13 of this document, Madam President, you will see, I think on the 5th paragraph one can read.  I am going to read it under your supervision.  "Considering that not satisfied with the said judgment, Edouard Nturiye and Jean Francois Kayiraga lodge an appeal before this court respectively on the 23rd of April 1998 and 29th April 1998.  And also reference is made to Anastasia Kinamubazi.  On page 14 of the said document, the Court of appeal says as follows:  And I am quoting, Madam President, subject to your guidance, "Having heard the appeal by Edouard Nturiye, transmitted to the Court on five different dates.  22nd April 1998, 22nd June, 1998, 23rd November 1998, 4th January 1999 and 8th February 1999.  Having heard the appeal of John Francois Emmanuel Kayiraga, transmitted to the court on three different dates, 29th April 1998, 15th July 1998 and 3rd July 2000.  Having heard the findings communicated to the court by Counsel Arsene Rutiyomva, counsel for Edouard Nturiye and 
	Jean Francois Emmanuel Kayiraga, having heard the findings communicated to the court by Mr. Birwero (phonetic), member of the team of advocates without borders, Counsel for the appellants, having heard the Officer of the public Prosecutor's office in the north communicated to the court and admissibility under appeal.  Madam President, it appears, based on that judgment that Anasthase Nkinamumbanzi wasn't able to appeal against the judgment of the specialised chamber of the court of first instance of Kibuye because the Court of appeal never received his appeal."  

Now, based on these two pages I am requesting that this document which is the judgment of the court of appeal which has already been admitted as exhibit D. 21, I am asking that a special reference be made to those two pages because the witness has stated that he wasn't able to lodge an appeal due to the problems that had been alluded to earlier.  I am proposing that these documents be tendered as Defence exhibits D. 83, if there's no objection on the other side of the Court? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, yes?  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, the document is already in evidence as a Defence Exhibit.  I see no reason for it to be readmitted on a second occasion and what my learned friend wishes to comment on is a matter of submission that he can properly make at the conclusion of the Trial but it's not necessary in the Prosecution's submission for the document to be re-entered into evidence.  It's already in evidence. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Well Prosecutor, the Witness is here.  He says that he lodged an appeal from the Kibuye prison yard and he said he never reached the Court of Appeal.  And I am trying to prove that this is a credible testimony being provided by the witness because yesterday this was challenged and I am saying that pages 13 and 14 do collaborate or support what the witness has just stated.  And so I am highlighting what appears in those two pages. It may escape the attention of a legal assistant that is in charge of that case file and that is why I am saying so. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Monthé
MR. MONTHÉ:
 We don't think that this document should be admitted in view of the fact that the judgment itself is already part of the record.  You read certain excerpts that are of interest, there should be no fear.  There might be some notations by the Witness. The whole document already been admitted and you have already read out the document of concern to you, so we don't deem it necessary to have it 
re-admitted. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madame President, the determination will lay with you.  Of course, be that as it may I wish to refer to the rather concrete or practical nature to the statement made by the witness.  Madam President, I now wish to conclude with that judgment of the Ruhengeri court of appeal. To take you back to one aspect of a matter that had been raised earlier. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Now, Witness, you told us or you told this Court in the course of your evidence in chief, that you had made mention of Anasthase Rushema during the Kibuye trial; is that correct? 
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, right from the beginning of the trial the issue of Anasthase Rushema came up.  And he was summoned to appear.  So at every stage of the trial, Rushema was a matter that was raised. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, since the need does not arise for me to provide copies of the said judgment, I will subject to your guidance, read out the last but one paragraph of page 9 of the said judgment, of the Court of Appeal of Ruhengeri.  Now, the Court Rules as follows: having noticed that the confession and the guilty plea of Anastasia Nkinamumbanzi can not be admitted by the court, because the accused does not fulfill the requirements.  He is not telling the truth and he is lying, referring to the fact that Tabumukiye had been killed, whereas Rushema and Telesphore who appeared on his behalf said they did not learn of the death of that individual.  Merely to point out to the fact that the witness here did make mention of the fact that Anasthase Rushema was referred to by the Kibuye court of first instance. I have now concluded with respect to the judgment of the Kibuye court of first instance's judgment.  I now wish to move on to the document that has just been admitted.  Document produced by the Prosecutor it bears the number and it is in Kinyarwanda language K0261488 believe, It bears the number P --  it is a letter dated, 7th November 2001, written allegedly by the witness and addressed to the President of the Supreme Court it bears the number P. 57. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, you told this Court that you did not go far in your studies, is that is correct? 
A.	I didn't go far in my studies and I can confirm that before this Court. 
Q.	Thank you, did you study in law? 
A.	No, I did not study law.  Madam President, Your Honours.  In my country I am considered as a peasant, so, I didn't study law when I was in School. 
Q.	Thank you for that clarification, Witness.  Now the letter dated 7th November 2001. And the original of which is in Kinyarwanda and it bears the number 0261486 and in French, 0270489 which is addressed to the Supreme Court.  Are you the one who drafted this document or were you assisted by someone at the prison yard? 
A.	I agree with the Defence Counsel that I used the services of a third party, who assisted me in drafting this document, otherwise I am not able to do so. 
Q.	Yes, thank you.   Witness, the third party whose service you sought, was that someone outside the prison or someone from the management of the prison? 
A.	We don't have the right to call on someone from out of the prison.  And let me remind the Defence Counsel that we are detainees, so it was another detainee who assisted me in drafting this document. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now when he assisted you to having drafted this document, do you remember having signed this document? 
A.	I think I signed the document unless -- unless I am mistaken. Otherwise, I think most documents are signed. 
Q.	Do you remember that document shown to you by the Prosecutor earlier on or would you want me to show you the document so as to be sure it is the same document? 
A.	I remember the document but please, if you can show it to me again so that this matter can be dealt with once and for all. 
Q.	Thank you? 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, can I ask the registry to come and or to take up P.  57.  I think it is better that you take the one that is on the record there, in the documents so that I am not accused of anything whatsoever. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ: 
Q.	 Well, Witness, you have the document with you. Could you go to the last page that is K 0261488 last page.  Have you looked at the document carefully? 
A.	Yes Counsel.

1730H 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	When you write to judicial authorities in Rwanda, when you send a document of this nature to them, is it -- can it be taken by prison officials for transmission without your signature?  
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, this is an impeachable evidence.  We were not allowed to send out documents that were no signed.  Unsigned documents are viewed as traps, and I am surprised to see these documents today, and I am surprised that it has been admitted as part of this record here? 
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I wish to draw the attention of your court to the most recent exhibits of the Prosecution which were used here.  Now, in referring to this letter dated 7th November 2001, I must confess that I am surprised.  Now, I have several letters of the exhibits of the Prosecutor, worded in various ways, addressed to the same persons, but of different dates.  Now, regarding the documents tendered by the Prosecutor, there is K0261489, dated 7th November 2001, and the purpose is an appeal for review of case RPCPHSS 014/01/RMP50919.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Could Counsel Monthé be requested to read slowly, because there is no way he can be interpreted.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Now, let me go back the document K261489, it is an application for review of Case 
No. RPCHSP-014/01/98 RMP-50919/S4/GN/KBY/98, which was used by the Prosecutor earlier on.  Madam President, on that same date, 7th November 2001, addressed to the president of the 
supreme court of Kigali, the number is No. K-02471478, subject:  Application for review of Case 
No. RPCHSP-0140198RMP/50919/S4/KBY/98, and we have, finally, Madam President, the document bearing the number K-0261492 -no, 472, it is an application for review of Case 
No. RPCH/SP/014/01/98/RMP50919/S4/GN/KBY/98 and the English version of the same document that I have just quoted, now Defence's concern is as follows, now these various documents the allegation each time differs -- differs from what was referred to in the document produced by the Prosecutor.  So, my question to the witness is as follows?
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, how many applications did you address to the Supreme Court while you were in prison?  
A.	I believe I wrote only one letter.  I never wrote two letters.  And we were summoned and informed on the basis of the two letters that our application had been denied.  Since our applications were denied, the Court should not rely on those letters whereas they are not valid. 
Q.	Perhaps you have not quite understood my question, my question was this:  On the 7th of November 2001, did you write only one application to the President of the supreme court of Rwanda through the administrator of your prison?  Did you write only one letter or two letters on that date? 
A.	I wrote only one letter on the 7th, and it was addressed to the court of appeal -- to the Supreme Court.  While I was at Kibuye prison, I wrote only one letter which was addressed to the Supreme Court. 
Q.	How do you then, explain, Witness Nkinamumbanzi, on the 7th of November 2001, that in your case file in your country, several applications bearing the same date and addressed to the Supreme Court with the subject being different in each of those letters; how do you explain that to this Court? 
A.	When letters were forwarded, only one letter was forwarded, but that letter could be in three stages: We would explain the subject of the letter -- I, myself do not understand how you were able to obtain those letters bearing the same date and which I sent, allegedly, to the President of the Tribunal?  All I know is that I wrote one letter.  As for the others, I do not know where you got them from. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, could you request the Registrar to assist me in showing the letters to the Court -- the letters which were disclosed to me by the Prosecutor?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, please assist counsel.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, they are not -- they all go together.  They are all part of the same document.  They are not different copies.  Madam President, these are different applications dated 7th November 2001 and purportedly written by the witness.  They were disclosed to me exactly as you see them by the Office of the Prosecutor.  I would be obliged if the Registrar could obtain this letter from the Prosecutor who kindly disclosed them to me.

Madam President, the Defence's concern is that we have observed that the witness here present, wrote on the 7th of November 2001, an application to the Rwandan Supreme Court and in the documents disclosed to us regarding the same dates, there are different subjects, and the date remains the same.  So, Madam President, in order to show how strange this procedure is, I would like to tender this document as a Defence exhibit, to the effect that on the 7th of November 2001, the witness here present submits that he wrote only one letter, and that none of the letters were signed by him, be it in Kinyarwanda or any other language because an application for review is different and cannot be based on the same subject.  That is why I would request that it should be tendered and admitted as Defence exhibit, unless the Prosecutor objects.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, do you object? 
MR. MOSES:
I don't understand either, but if my learned friend wants to tender it, I am not going to object.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, are you requesting that the three documents in French be admitted, because there is a fourth document in English?  

MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, my working language is French.  I had received those documents as a translation of the Prosecution Exhibit P. 57.  It is in English, it's not necessary for me who speaks French.  As for the three other documents which are in French, I would request that they be admitted as Defence exhibits.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecutor.  
MR. MOSES: 
As I indicated, I am not quite really following what my friend is getting at.  If this is a separate document and there is an original Kinyarwanda, and we have that in our possession, and clearly I would be wanting that admitted.  We have only been shown the translation of a document, we don't -- it doesn't seem he is in possession of the Kinyarwanda original.  It looked to be very similar to the document -- the translation which we have already entered into evidence, but I am not really understanding what my friend wants to go on -- and it is all in the name of the witness before us.  I don't know if the witness can recognise, if that is really our concern, because it is in French, and he has not been shown the document as yet. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I did not think we were doing to legal arguments on this document, which was disclosed by the Prosecutor himself.  The Prosecutor gave me these documents to me exactly as they are.  The Prosecutor does not seem to have heard my submissions.  This is the purpose of the submissions.  The Prosecutor stated, and having the exhibit P. 57 admitted, that is the document of the 7th of November 2001 purportedly written by the Supreme Court.  We examined the witness before the Bench and asked him how many letters he wrote on 7th November 2001, and he stated that he wrote only one with the assistance of someone else.  He said customarily he assigns documents, but he did not sign this one.  The issue that I am concerned with is this, Madam President:  As a legal person I am shocked that the document sent to the Supreme Court cannot be a document for review -- as an appeal document and a document for annulment, and it was written in the same day with different subjects.  That is why the witness told the Chamber that he didn't know who the author was of that document, and I am requesting that these documents be admitted by the Court, They were disclosed by the Prosecutor with a K-number.  So the Prosecutor knows these documents very well.  I don't want to go into any arguments with him on the nature and origin of these documents today.  This is what I would like to say, Madam President, to buttress my request which is well founded in law and is a conventional request.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecutor, very briefly.  
MR. MOSES: 
It does appear to be another document which was disclosed with the witness's signature in Kinyarwanda on the same date of 7th November.  So if counsel wants it in, it can go in.  No problem, I have got the original signed by the witness. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Mr. Prosecutor, you would agree with me that I can only have what he disclosed to me.  I am not accustomed into going into your office.  So, if you had disclosed this document I would have had it, but I did not admit it in Kinyarwandan, and I would very happily receive this disclosure from you.
MR. MOSES: 
We sent it to them and it has disclosure numbers from the registry on the top -- it was disclosed on 10th of August 2004.  So, I am happy to give it to my friend.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
	Thank you for your kindness. 

Madam President, I would like to tender this document signed by this witness.  I want to show him this document.  Furthermore, this document is in Kinyarwanda.  At this stage I cannot seriously appreciate its contents, and only the witness can do that, and that is why I would like the registry to show the document to him.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ: 
Q.	Witness, please look at this document carefully and tell us whether it is the document for appeal that you purportedly wrote and signed.  
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, regarding the contents of this letter, the Prosecutor has shown me several of my signatures, and now he is showing documents that are not signed.  Do you want to know whether this document that is signed and not signed is from me?  This is my answer.  The prison administration did not allow us to send unsigned letters.  You are arguing on this document, and I wondering why you are arguing on letters that were not signed and that have been tendered into evidence.  How can you give any value to the unsigned documents? 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I would like to reiterate my request to the Chamber regarding the admission of the three documents I showed you a while ago, concerning the documents or appeals, annulment and review, and these documents have different subjects.  So I stand by my request, reminding the Chamber, that as the witness has just said, the Kinyarwanda version of that document of the 7th of November 2001, which was admitted as Prosecution exhibit, has not been signed.   It does not bear a signature and I pointed out that to the Chamber sufficiently.  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, the document shown to the witness is not the Prosecution exhibit, it is 57, and it's a different document.  It is a document that has the signature on the date -- it has a signature.  It is not the same. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, does that document you have just looked at bear your signature?  

THE WITNESS: 
Madam President, Your Honours, this document indeed bears my signature, but what I find surprising is the fact that the version letters on the same subjection, but the letters are not signed.  Let me point out again that we were not authorised to send unsigned documents.  I have stated on several occasions that I always signed my documents.  If you wish to admit these unsigned letters into evidence, it is your right, but I am wondering how these unsigned letters got to the offices of the persons concerned. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registrar, could you, please, bring back the documents to us?

Counsel Monthé?
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We note that the document that has just been shown to the witness is same as the one that was shown us a while ago in Kinyarwanda, but there is a page missing in one of the documents.  We have all the pages in one of the documents and another one has a missing page.  

Witness, we would like you to know that we have admitted the documents, and we will determine the probative value of each of those documents.  That is how we proceed. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, from a practical stand point, since these documents that he did not signed have been proposed by the Prosecutor and he did not request admission of the document, I have requested admission of three documents.  Now, I do not know which document you want to admit. The one admitted by the Prosecutor is not signed, and you are saying that we are dealing with the same document.  I don't know whether we will be in a position to distinguish between the two documents.  

Madam President, before you raise this problem, at this stage of the proceedings, the Prosecutor has completed his cross-examination -- what I am saying is that the Prosecutor at this stage has completed his cross-examination, so he cannot have any document admitted.  I do not want the Prosecutor to have admitted the documents he has referred to.  I have requested that the three documents be admitted.  The Prosecutor has not requested that the document be admitted.  I don't know what the problem is at this stage in our proceedings.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber admits the three documents tendered into evidence by the Defence.  All three documents, bearing the same date, 7th of November 2001, one bearing No. K0261472 Exhibit number D.  83.  The other is K0261478, Exhibit No. D. 84.  There is another one, bearing number K026147489 and Exhibit No. D. 85.  The Chamber finds that for purposes of clarity, the Chamber pro prio motu admits two documents, one bearing number K0261470, and indicated as Exhibit Chamber (1), and another is K0265372 and it is entered as Exhibit Chamber (2).  We have also admitted these two documents.  
(Exhibit Nos. D. 83, D. 84, D. 85 and Exhibit Nos. Chamber (1) and Chamber (2) admitted)
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President, I still have a series of questions to put to, Witness Kinyambazi, and I will propose that we adjourn since we have gone beyond the normal time.   So, we can end with him tomorrow and then take F13, who has been waiting for the past three days.  I thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The court stands adjourned today.  We resume tomorrow at 9 a.m.

Witness, you will still appear before this court tomorrow morning in order to take questions from the Defence, still as part of your re-examination.  

Good evening to you all and thank you.  
(Court adjourned at 1740H)
