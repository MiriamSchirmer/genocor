MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is in session.  

Good day, ladies and gentlemen.  We note that the Defence is not present for the continuation of proceedings.  The lawyers to whom the notification of our decision of 21st September 2004 was given at the end of the day have not responded.  

We, therefore, note that the proceedings against the Accused, Athanase Seromba, cannot continue in the absence of the Defence.  

Consequently, the proceedings are adjourned to Monday the 27 September 2004 at 2 p.m. 

Are there any remarks?
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, Your Honours, what has just happened is not something that is easy to understand.  Perhaps with your assistance, it may be clearer.  There is your order which you issued yesterday with a warning to the counsel.  And, apart from that order, there was the notification of the registry which has assigned the counsel and co-counsel -- that is, Counsel Pognon and 
Counsel Monthé -- to represent the Accused.  There has been no response from the part of counsel. However, there is an obligation under Rule 44 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, which requires counsel assigned to represent the Accused until the end of the trial.  

In the absence of any approved justification, and I emphasise "approved", the Accused or the counsel of the Accused, Seromba, have not, at any time, requested leave to withdraw from the case.  They are supposed to continue to represent the Accused until they are replaced.  

Your Honours, my opinion is that the conduct of this counsel is very much against the interest of justice.  It slows down the procedure and should be punished.  

I should also like to point out that there are major problems.  In order to ease the proceedings, the Prosecutor had notified or disclosed to the Defence the names of all the witnesses it intends to call; that is, names, identity and all other particulars.  This means that we are in a situation where all the Prosecution witnesses, as well as their particulars, are in the keeping of the other party.  We are not aware whether this party is -- or parties are still required to represent the Accused because the counsel did not request leave to withdraw; did not fulfil the obligation of continued representation up until the end of the trial; sought no authorisation; did not respect the order of the Judge; and did not respond to the invitation of the registry following the order issued by the Judges.  I think, therefore, that the situation is very serious and should be punished, and it should be considered as contempt of court.  All the conditions are present so that this contempt of court is punished.  

Apart from all these remarks, the Prosecutor would also like to know how things would proceed from now on: what is going to happen on Monday and under what conditions shall these activities take place?  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor:  

The Trial Chamber has stated before we cannot continue proceedings without the presence of Defence.  The Trial Chamber had already applied sanction against the lawyers.  The registry has written to the already assigned counsel -- that is, those who were here -- to notify them that he intends to reassign them or to write to them again, and they need to respond to this notification.  I said that the response has not been forthcoming so far.  Notification was issued today to the counsel.  We are aware of this, because we received a copy of this notification.  

You also said that you do not know how proceedings will continue.  We believe that next week either with these lawyers who will, by then, have accepted to represent the Accused or with other assigned counsel.  We shall begin hearing witnesses in the order that has already been proposed by the Prosecution.  

Consequently, we shall, I believe, be hearing the investigator first. 
MS. ARBIA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I would like to find out whether it is possible -- during this weekend, is it possible to have a meeting so that we can define the situation.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If we understood you correctly, are you asking us to hold hearing during the weekend? 
MS. ARBIA:
If it is possible, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, we have said that the matter has been adjourned to Monday, 27th September.  So we shall not be holding any hearings during the weekend.  However, we shall see in due course, if necessary, whether it is possible to sit all day if there is a courtroom available or, possibly, on Friday, and we shall notify you at the right time. 
MS. ARBIA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you also, Madam Prosecutor.

Court is adjourned.
(Court adjourned at 1435H)
