MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  

Before we bring in the witness, it appears that Mr. Monthé has some remarks for the Chamber.  

Yes, Mr. Monthé, you have the floor. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Yes, Madam President, Your Honours.  I wanted to make a statement in closed session to your Chamber.  This is an issue that deals protection of our witnesses.  I believe the Chamber should be informed of this issue, given how serious it is.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
Mr. Prosecution, any objection? 
MR. MOSES:   
No, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Very well.  We are going to move into a closed session, and this will enable Mr. Monthé to raise the issues he mentioned regarding the protection of Defence witnesses.  We apologise for any inconvenience caused to the public.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, our investigator has the right to stay because, in fact, you already issued an order to that effect.  I see that he is being ushered out of the courtroom, and I am a bit surprised by that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Could you kindly verify if the investigator is present?  It appears he has been ushered out of the Court; perhaps it is because the registry is not familiar with him.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript pages 2 to 4 was extracted and sealed under separate cover as the session was heard in camera)

THE WITNESS: 
Good afternoon, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
We wish to remind you that you are still under oath, and Mr. Nekuie of the Defence team is going to continue with his examination-in-chief.  Do you feel better today?  
THE WITNESS:  
Yes, I have no problem, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nekuie, you may proceed. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Madam President.

WITNESS YA1
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. NUKUIE: 
Q.	Witness YA1, good afternoon.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	The Defence is reassured to know that you are feeling well today, and if that is the case, we may continue with the exercise which we began last week.  Are you ready to proceed? 
A.	Yes, we may proceed without any problem. 
Q.	Thank you.  In order to refresh your memory, do you confirm that when we adjourned last week, we were dealing with the 8th of April 1994, your 8th day on that day in Nyange? 
A.	Yes, I recall. 
Q.	Very well.  Before we move into that day of the 8th of April 1994, can you please indicate to the Chamber with precision, the kind of trade you were practising at the time? 
A.	Thank you.  I was involved in trade of various articles.  I was a retailer of ***********************
, and articles of that nature.  In other words, I was moving about and I was a hawker. 
Q.	Now, in your hawking, do you remember the locations to which you had the habit of going or frequenting? 
A.	A moment ago, I was saying that I moved about here and there, and I shall mention names of places I visited, the marketplace in Nyange, and quite close to the statue of the Virgin Mary.  Those are the names of the places which I can mention to you. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When you say close to the "Virgin Mary statue," you mean in other words the Nyange church? 
A.	Yes, I would get to the church.  I would get to the marketplace and the statue of the Virgin Mary and many other places. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did it occur that you went to the presbytery of that church in Nyange? 
A.	Yes, I would go there quite regularly. 
Q.	Very well.  Were you then able to know the priests and other clergy members who lived there? 
A.	Yes, I knew them. 
Q.	Can you mention a few of them for the benefit of the Chamber? 
A.	You mean the priests? 
Q.	Yes, the clergymen that you met in that period of time when you were moving about up to and including the presbytery. 
A.	The priests that I knew at the Nyange parish at the time would include Fatter Seromba and 
	Father Straton. 
Q.	Thank you.  Father Straton, do you know what exactly was his function at that church in Nyange at the time? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you please tell the Chamber what functions he carried out? 
A.	I think at the time the - - Father Straton was a parish priest. 
Q.	And Father Seromba, if you recall, for how long had you been meeting him regularly at that church? 
A.	I don't remember very well.  However, I believe I began to see him there from the month of October or November of the year 2003. 
Q.	You mean 1993 or 2003? 
A.	Yes, it was indeed that 1993. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Without mentioning any names, did you know the non-clergy employees who worked there? 
A.	Yes, I knew some. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  Did you ever hear it said that at the time that there were refugees at 
	Nyange church? 
A.	No, I don't know about that.  I didn't hear anyone say anything like that. 
Q.	Very well.  Let's come back to the day of the 8th of April 1994.  What did you see in particular at the commune office on that day? 
A.	I saw refugees there who had come to seek refuge there. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, these refugees, were they escorted by anyone or did they go there by themselves, if you recall? 
A.	I didn't see anyone escorting those refugees. 
Q.	Very well.  Did you notice at the time whether these refugees were armed, and if so, with what weapons were they armed? 
A.	I did not see any weapons. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Until what time of day did you normally have the habit of seeing what was being done, what was happening at the commune office? 
A.	I was able to make those observations because I passed by there, within the framework of my trade. Otherwise, I wasn't responsible for monitoring what was happening there on a continuous basis. 
Q.	Very well.  Now, within the framework of your trade, and since you passed by there, were you able to see or hear it said that Father Seromba had gone there on that day of the 8th April 1994?
A.	No, I didn't see him go to the office either, and I didn't hear anyone say that he had gone to the commune office. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  Were you able to see the same Father Seromba on the following day, in other words, the 9th day or days thereafter at the commune office? 
A.	No, I never saw him at the commune office. 
Q.	Very well, Mr. Witness.  Were you able to hear it said that some of the refugees were sought after in particular, and, if so, can you tell us what refugees would have been involved? 
A.	I never heard it said that there were refugees who were being particularly sought. 
Q.	Very well, Mr. Witness.  From when, from what date were you seeing the refugees who were at the commune office leaving that place to go to Nyange parish? 
MR. MOSES: 
I would just ask my friend if he could not lead so much with his questions. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nekuie. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
It is indeed Nekuie, Madam President.  Madam President, I don't understand the observation made by the Prosecutor, and I do not know whether it is in the form of an objection.  When he is talking about leading, I would like to find out from him which are the leading questions and how far they are leading. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:   
Mr. Prosecutor, very quickly, please, can you please respond. 
MR. MOSES:  
Very quickly, Your Honour, this question said, "When was he able to know that the refugees went from the communal office to the Nyange church?" I don't believe we have had any evidence yet that the refugees did go from the communal office to Nyange church. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nekuie, can you reformulate your question, please?  In other words, did you hear what the Prosecutor said?  Because you mentioned the departure of the refugees from the communal office to the Nyange church, and the witness has not yet made any such mention.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
I believe that the examination-in-chief also deals with his written statement, his written statement.  And also the interpretation of my questions by the Prosecution seems to me a bit erroneous because I did not I ask him when he went to the Nyange church to see the refugees going there.  I think that it goes without saying that I will withdraw that question as it was, and I am ready to reformulate my question. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:  
Q.	Witness AY1; were you able to see the refugees who were at the communal office moving from that place to another location? 
A.	Yes, the refugees who were at the communal office left that place to go to the parish. 
Q.	Thank you.  Thank you, Witness.  So from what date did you see them leave the communal office for them to go to the parish, as you said? 
A.	I started seeing the refugees leave as from the 9th. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  So, in your observation of this movement from the commune officer to the parish, were you able to notice whether someone encouraged them to do that or whether they went there of their own accord? 
A.	I don't know whether someone asked the refugees to move.  I don't know anyone who would have done so.  All I realised was that the refugees were going to the parish, and as they left the 
	commune office. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Were you able to tell or did you get to know how they were received at the parish? 
A.	The refugees were well received. 
Q.	Very well.  Mr.  Witness.  Can you please clarify that answer, in other words, that they were well received?  Can you explain that further? 
A.	I testified that the refugees were well received because, if my memory serves me right, Father Seromba encouraged people to come to the assistance of these refugees, to bring them, in particular, foodstuffs and other kinds of assistance 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  Since you were in a trade which enabled you to move about throughout the area, after they settled down at the Nyange church, were you able to see under what conditions they were living there? 
A.	Yes, I was able to see some refugees outside where they were.  They were cooking, and from that observation, I realised under what conditions they were living. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Under what circumstances did you realise that Father Seromba was encouraging people to come to the assistance of these refugees? 
A.	I knew about this on the 10th at the parish and even on the 11th.  On that day, on the 11th, I didn't go to the church, but I heard others say so. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  Now, that appeal by Father Seromba, according to you, was it listened to by those to whom he was addressing himself?
A.	Yes, some responded to his appeal. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  But tell us in real terms what they were actually able to do in response to that appeal. 
A.	Some of members of the population brought foodstuffs to the refugees, and others brought firewood.
Q.	Very well, Mr. Witness.  So for how long - - if you recall - - for how long do you think this assistance lasted between the 10th -- and how long you - - for how long the food was being brought, this assistance was being brought to the refugees? 
A.	I think that this assistance was provided to the refugees for a period of two days; this is my estimate. 
Q.	Very well, Mr. Witness.  Now, was there any particular reason for that assistance supply to be interrupted, or did the people themselves just merely decide not to bring it anymore? 
A.	The disturbances intensified.  And people were saying that Father Seromba was sheltering Inyenzi.  So, given the intensification of the disturbances, the assistance that was being provided was interrupted because the objective was to do wrong to the refugees, these Tutsis. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When you saw that the disturbances intensified, can you give us an explanation of how that intensification manifested itself? 
A.	There were people who were armed with machetes, spears, and sticks who wanted to kill those Tutsis. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you ever get to know why they wanted to kill those Tutsis? 
A.	It was said that those Tutsis were Inyenzis.  Furthermore, it was said that the Father in question was the one who was providing them with shelter. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  According to you, what do think they meant by the term "Inyenzi", such that they decided that Father Seromba, who was also providing the refugees with shelter, would be someone to be killed? 
A.	When they spoke of Inyenzi, what they meant was the Tutsis. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Do you think this term "Inyenzi" is a word which was made up by the Hutus to be used in reference to the Tutsis?  Do you really know the origin of that term? 
A.	With regard to the origin of that word, "Inyenzi", I know it was used to refer to the Tutsis.  Later on, they were known as Inyenzi-Inkotanyi. 
Q.	Thank you.  So, the Tutsis gave themselves that name; is that what you said?  They called themselves Inyenzi-Inkotanyi? 
A.	I believe that that was my understanding.  That is what other people say.  They said that the Inyenzis were Tutsis.  They were Inyenzi-Inkotanyi, in other words. 
Q.	Very well, sir.  Since they had machetes and they were making threats to Father Seromba, as you said, did they carry out the threats?  Do you remember? 
A.	At one point the attackers carried out their threat. 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, can you tell the Chamber when you saw those threats being carried out completely? 
A.	If my memory serves me well, I believe I saw them around the 14th.  They were armed with sticks and machetes and clubs.  But on that particularly day, they didn't do anything.  They went home without perpetrating any act. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  Did you hear that attacks had been planned ahead of time, that day of the 14th? 
A.	I never learned that attacks had been planned at any point in time. 
Q.	Very well, sir.  On the 14th of April 1994, you said they did not attack the refugees at the church; was that correct?  You said they went back. 
A.	Yes, I said they were close to the statue of the Virgin Mary.  They had sticks, clubs and machetes, but I said that they did not carry out any attacks on that day. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  Did you see the attack on those refugees on the other day? 
A.	Yes, I witnessed an attack on those people, and it was on the 15th.
Q.	Very well, sir.  Did you know the people who were attacking on that date of the 15th? 
A.	With regard to those attackers who attacked on the 15th, they had come from Rushongo, Gashumbi, Kibederera, from all over. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  So you didn't know them at all? 
A.	I don't know them, but I was able to identify a few of them, especially Ndungutse, and even Kayishema.  I could see them as part of the attacks. 
Q.	Very well, sir.  Can you tell the Chamber who Ndungutse was, and who Kayishema was? 
A.	Kayishema was a criminal investigations officer at the communal office in our area.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Was about Ndungutse?  What did he do? 
A.	Ndungutse was a teacher. 
Q.	Very well.  Did you ever hear that on the 15th of April 1994 whether or not those assailants had any connection whatsoever with Father Seromba? 
A.	It's clear, Counsel.  There couldn't have been any links between him and the assailants.  He was with refugees.  He asked for them to be helped, and, consequently, it is obvious that there was no link between Seromba and those attackers. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  So you saw them attack on the 15th of April 1994, they attacked the refugees who were there?  Please describe the scene for the benefit of the Chamber as it unfolded before your eyes. 
A.	This is what I saw:  It was in the afternoon; a grenade was thrown.  I saw that some people had been killed; it was a horrible situation.  At that point, I decided to go home.  I became afraid, in fact.
Q.	Very well.  Did you see whether or not those assailants had any leaders among them? 
A.	Among the attackers, I told you I saw Ndungutse and Kayishema.  I even saw some gendarmes. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  Witness, you said that you saw some gendarmes; can you tell the Chamber what exactly they were doing?
A.	The gendarmes were also part of the attack.  They took part as well. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  With regard to those gendarmes, did you ever see them prior to the 15th of April and even after, or did you ever hear they were with Father Seromba? 
A.	I never heard such a thing. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  On the 15th of April 1994, you decided to go home, as you have just told the Chamber.  Do you remember what time you decided to do so? 
A.	I don't remember what it was.  I told you after the grenade was thrown in the afternoon, I saw that some people had been killed.  I was frightened, and I decided to home, but I don't really remember what time it was exactly. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, do you know who threw the grenade that you mentioned? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Very well.  The next day, the 16th of April 1994, did you see anything on that day?  And, if so, please tell the Chamber what you saw. 
A.	I heard that the church had been destroyed.  To leave home, I had to go without my parents seeing me, and I went to the church.  I could see that they were in the process of destroying the bell tower. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, of course, you can't be specific with regard to the time.  Nevertheless, you decided to go to the church.  Can you tell us whether it was in the morning or afternoon? 
A.	It was in the afternoon.  I went to the church in the afternoon. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  You saw the bell tower being destroyed; how was that? 
A.	When I arrived on site, I could see people using a bulldozer to destroy the tower. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You said people were using the bulldozer.  Were those the same attackers as on the previous day? 
A.	I said that I went to the church.  On my arrival, the church had already been destroyed.  Only the tower was left standing.  And in order to destroy that tower, people were using a bulldozer. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  You were able to identify who was using the bulldozer? 
A.	No, I was not able to identify those people. 
Q.	Thank you, sir.  Did you see Mr. Ndungutse and Mr. Kayishema amongst those people? 
A.	Yes, they were there as well. 
Q.	What exactly were they doing if you were able to see it? 
A.	They participated in all the attacks, and I told myself and believed that they were the leaders of the attacks. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you ever hear that Father Seromba was involved in the destruction of the church or had ordered the destruction of the church? 
A.	I never heard such a thing.  I never heard anyone say that he had any role whatsoever in the destruction of the church. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did you see Father Seromba on that day on site? 
A.	On that day, I did not see him. 
Q.	Very well, sir.  Did you see any other clergy members on that day on site? 
A.	No, none. 
Q.	Very well, sir.  For how long were you there watching the destruction of the church, and did you see the tower go down while you were there? 
A.	The tower fell while I was there, but there were many people there as well.  There was lots of dust that blew around when the tower fell.  After that, I left the area. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  The people destroyed the church and then destroyed the tower in front of your eyes.  Do you remember how many there were on that day? 
A.	I have no figure to give you.  I didn't count the people who were there. 
Q.	Sure.  Can you simply tell us whether they were many of them, few of them or neither one or the other? 
A.	There were many attackers, but I can't tell you how many exactly. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Can you tell us what their state was?  I am talking about the assailants.  
A.	Counsel, I do not understand your question.  Do you mean how they were dressed?  What do you mean?  I am not sure what you are asking me. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  Let me rephrase it so you understand it better.  Talk to me specifically about their attitudes.  What type of attitude did they display while they were destroying the church? 
A.	They were smiling; they were angry.  They were mean-spirited, and it was that meanness that led them to do that. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  With regard to that attitude, do you believe that it would have been possible for anyone to stop them from committing the crime they committed? 
A.	Counsel, I told you there were officials among the attackers. Those officials were the people who were supposed to stop that kind of thing.  If they weren't going to do to, who else could have? 
Q.	I thank you, sir.  Do you believe that those officials that you mentioned had any link whatsoever with Father Seromba? 
A.	I don't believe there was any link.  If such a link had existed, those authorities could not have participated in the destruction of the church. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Do you believe, therefore, that outside of those officials Father Seromba could have stopped the church from being destroyed? 
A.	Counsel, Father Seromba had no power to stop the church from being destroyed.  In fact, people were saying that he was the one who was housing the Inyenzis.  And, let me tell you, not everyone respects a priest.  Not everyone has to respect a priest.  
MR. NEKUIE:
I didn't receive the translation.  Madam President, I didn't receive the translation. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You didn't hear the witness's answer? 
MR. NEKUIE: 
No, not at all, Madam President.    
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can the booth repeat the response? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness answered the Father Seromba had no power to stop the church from being destroyed.  And, furthermore, people don't always respect priests.  Not everyone respects a priest.
BY MR. NEKUIE: 
Q.	Thank you, sir. However, Witness, it seems to me that in Rwanda people say that priests are revered.  Didn't you know about that? 
A.	I stand by my statement.  People are not ordered to respect the priests; only those followers will respect the priests.  People are not obliged to respect the priests.  
Q.	Very well, Witness.  After the tower was destroyed, were you still on site? 
A.	I said that when the tower came down, I had left immediately. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  Were you able to find out what happened after you left? 
A.	Counsel, I told you that the tower came down while I was there and I had left immediately.  After that, I did not go back to the place. 
Q.	Yes, I have understood, YA1, but what I am asking is whether or not you heard anything about what happened after you left. 
A.	I don't really understand the sense of your question.  I believe that I am talking about the things that I witnessed myself. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness YA1, if you left Rwanda, how long ago did you do so? 
A.	I went into exile in 1994.  To this day I am still in exile.
Q.	Thank you, sir.  Before you left, did you ever see Father Seromba again? 
A.	I never saw Father Seromba again. 
Q.	Very well, sir.  If you ever were to come across him, would you be able to identify him? 
A.	Yes, I can identify him.  He was a priest at my parish.  I know him; I can identify him.
Q.	Very well, sir.  Witness, I am going to ask you look around this room and, in looking around the room, tell us whether or not you see Father Seromba in the room.  And if you do see him, please tell the Chamber where exactly he is in the room and attempt to describe him for us. 
A.	Counsel, would you grant me permission to greet him?  It's been a long time since I saw him. 
Q.	I understand, Witness; however, in this Chamber, you are not allowed to do that.  We might make other provisions for you to do that at a later stage.  Right now, I am simply asking you to tell us where he is, if you see him, and describe him for us. 
A.	Thank you.  From where you are, he is the third person. 
Q.	What do you mean starting with me?  From where I am? 
A.	What I mean is that he is the third person.  He is a priest who is wearing glasses. 
Q.	Very well, sir.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam President, Your Honours, can the Chamber record that the witness has recognised the Accused? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Let the record reflect that Witness YA1 has identified Father Seromba in the courtroom. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Madam President. 

BY MR. NEKUIE: 
Q.	Witness YA1, can you tell the Chamber what is your denomination, the denomination of your religion? 
A.	I am a Catholic. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  Are you a practising Catholic? 
A.	I am a Catholic.  I am a Christian.  I was baptised in church, in the Catholic Church, and my confirmation also took place in the Catholic Church. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  In your capacity as a Catholic and Christian, did you -- can you testify that you came here to testify and speak the truth? 
A.	Yes, I am speaking the truth.  I am relating facts of which I was an eyewitness. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam President, Your Honours, given that answer from the witness, the Defence comes to an end to its examination-in-chief. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
 We thank you, Mr. Nekuie.

Mr. Prosecutor, you may proceed with the cross-examination of this witness. 
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honour.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness YA1, can you confirm for me that the first time that you spoke to the Defence about the matters that you have testified to in Court was in February of this year? 
A.	Whom are you referring to in terms of the Defence teams?  Whom exactly are you referring to?  
Q.	Very well.  I have a statement here dated the 23rd of February of this year, which we have been told was a statement made by you to members of the Defence of the Accused Athanase Seromba.  Now --
A.	Yes, that was the date. 
Q.	All right.  And did you sign that statement? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, a couple of times during your testimony, you said words to the effect that "If my memory is correct."  Now, is it fair to say that it's now some 11 years since these events took place and your recollection might not be as good as it once was? 
A.	When your memory fails you, you should not testify.  So, I am testifying to what I recall. 
Q.	Very well.  Do you agree with me that when you spoke to the Defence that it was almost 11 years after the events that you are testifying to in Court?  Do you agree with me? 
A.	I don't quite understand the meaning of your question. 
Q.	All right.  You have been testifying about events that took place in April 1994.  I am saying to you the first time you made a statement about these events to the Defence was in February 2005. That's almost 11 years later.  Do you agree with me? 
A.	I take as point of reference the date on which I met Defence counsel and the date on which I went into exile.  I think that kind of time has gone by. 
Q.	Would you agree with me that your memory as of this year is not as good as it was about these events as it would have been some years earlier as opposed to the time of these events? 
A.	I don't agree with you because I am saying and I am relating about incidents I witnessed myself and facts which I remember properly. 
Q.	So, it's your evidence that your memory is as good today as it was several years ago; is that right? 
A.	I am recalling events which I was a witness to, an eyewitness.
Q.	That doesn't actually answer my question, Witness.  My question was:  Are you saying your memory is as good today as it was several years ago about these events which you are testifying to?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam President, the Defence wishes to make an objection regarding this kind of question from the Prosecution.  It is not for the Prosecutor to test the aptitude or the ability of this witness.  He should cross-examine the witness on the events he has testified to before this Tribunal, and he is inferring that the witness has failing memory because of passage of time.  He should not use that as a premise for his questions. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Prosecutor, what is your response to that objection, or would you reformulate your question? 
MR. MOSES:   
No, Your Honour, I believe it is a perfectly fair question for the witness.  Testing his aptitude is, in fact, one of the reasons people are cross-examined, to test their recollection.  And it is also a matter which can affect credibility, whether a witness gives a reasonable answer to what might be considered a reasonable question.  I believe that I have asked a reasonable question, whether this witness's memory - - whether he has testified to the fact that his memory is as good today as it was several years ago.  The answer to that question may be relevant, not only to his overall evidence, but also, Your Honour, to whether this witness is attempting to give fair and reasonable evidence before Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, can you answer that question which has been put to you by the Prosecution?  
THE WITNESS:
I said that I am recounting events which I recall as it happened and these are facts to which I was an eyewitness. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Yes, I heard that answer, Witness.  My question is a separate question, that is, whether you are saying to this Trial Chamber that your memory is good today as it was several years ago when remembering these events in Nyange parish in April 1994? 
A.	My memory is good. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Mr. Witness.  

Can you please proceed, Mr. Prosecutor? 
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, you told my learned friend in your evidence in-chief that you hadn't heard that Father Seromba had been involved in these events.  Now, I take it that you are now aware that people have accused Father Seromba of being involved in the events in Nyange parish; do you agree with that? 
MR. MONTHÉ:	
Madam President, I raise an objection.  This is not a question; that's a comment. You know that
 Mr. Seromba came from Nyange parish, what do you say about that?  This is an observation that the Prosecutor is making, and can the Prosecutor reformulate his question?  He is not here to make observations, and the witness is here to say what he heard and what he saw.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Can you respond, Mr. Prosecutor? 
MR. MOSES:  
I don't know whether it was a matter of translation, Your Honour, because my question was, are you aware that people were saying that he was -- that Father Seromba was involved.  He gave evidence that he didn't hear that Father Seromba was involved.  My question is, is he now aware that people have said that father Seromba was involved.  I don't know whether there is a translation issue.  I wasn't making a comment; I was asking the witness a question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you hear the question, Mr. Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
I told you that Father Seromba did not play any role during these events, and I stand by the fact that he asked for assistance for these people who were at the church.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Well, I will rephrase my question because it doesn't answer my question, Witness.  You have - - have you not now heard that people are saying Father Seromba was involved in the events at Nyange parish during April 1994?  That's correct, isn't it? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I do not understand the meaning of your question because I have repeatedly said that, as far as I know, to my knowledge, and given what he did, Father Seromba asked for assistance for the benefit of these people.  He wanted to come to their aid.  I don't know what answer you are looking for. 
Q.	Witness, you know the reason that you wee asked to come along and give evidence at the 
	Trial Chamber here is because people are saying Father Seromba was involved?  You are aware of that aren't you? 
A.	I'm not amongst those who are accusing him; I know that he played no role in these events. 
Q.	You have come along to testify to help Father Seromba; is that correct? 
A.	I understand very well. 
MR. NEKUIE:
The Defence is once again raising an objection, Madam President.  These are questions which are to budge the witness and to intimidate him.  He cannot be asked if he came here to help Father Seromba. And other question - - the earlier question was also inappropriate because the accusation for -- against Father Seromba does not go along with what people are saying.  So we need to look at the presumption of innocence which Father Seromba enjoys, and this is all tantamount to intimidating this witness and to stop him from testifying calmly. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What do you respond to-- what's your response, Mr. Prosecutor?
MR. MOSES: 
I do not understand the objection.  It's not a legal objection, with the greatest respect to my friends.  I have asked him a simple question, which the witness is able to understand.  I am not seeking to budge the witness; I have simply asked whether he had come here to help Father Seromba.  On what basis -- on what legal basis is that question objectionable?  I certainly know of no basis in law for such a question to be objected to. 
(Pages 5 to 17 by Petrus Chijarira)

















1600H 
JUDGE HÖKBORG:
Mr. Prosecutor, can I just ask you a question because we are having certain problems with, let's says, with what you actually mean.

Now, in French this is witness à décharge, which means it is a witness for the Defence.  Now, your question, whether he was here to help Father Seromba or not, we presume that question is the same as that, that he is a witness for the Defence; but if -- well, what is the difference?  Thank you.  
MR. MOSES:
One of the issues sometimes counsel for either party will want to establish is that of potential bias, especially if it does emerge, or it should happen to emerge that the witness has, for example, added things in their testimony to that which they have said previously; now, it is accumulative.  Sometimes a matter, which I decide during cross-examination, they may want to build up evidence which they can then rely on in their closing submissions to make submissions about a particular witness, and how a trier of fact, such as Your Honours, may view such a witness.  So, it is -- certainly though the purpose of the question is to go beyond simply saying, you are a witness for the Defence, it goes beyond that into the motive for the person coming to testify.

Your Honours, if I can also say -- if I can also say in the context of a witness who is not merely coming along to say what they saw or heard, but to -- as they have been led in their evidence-in-chief, to say that a particular person is innocent.  Now, in the light of that type of evidence, it is -- it is proper that the Prosecution should challenge the basis and the potential bias of such a witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I am going to reformulate the Prosecutor's question to you so that you can properly understand what he wants to know.  He wants to know whether you came here to testify or whether you came here, in particular, to assist the Accused.  
THE WITNESS:
I came here to testify on the events which I was an eyewitness to. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, now you have said in your evidence-in-chief on one, if not two, occasions that people said that Seromba was the one housing Tutsis.  Do you remember saying that in your evidence-in-chief? 
A.	I didn't understand your question.  Could you rephrase it or repeat it for me?  
Q.	In your evidence-in-chief did you say that people said that Father Seromba was the person housing Tutsis? 
A.	Yes, I do remember saying that people said that Seromba was the one housing the Tutsis.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the interpreters did not understand the last part of the answer that the witness gave. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, could you repeat the last part of your answer; you were not clearly heard?  Could you please repeat it?  
THE WITNESS:
You are asking me to confirm that I said that I heard people say that Father Seromba was housing the Tutsis; I believe that was the gist of the question.  And I responded that; yes, indeed, people did say that Father Seromba was the one who was housing the Tutsis. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Who told you that?  What was the name of the person? 
A.	I said that among them you had people like Kayishema and Ndungutse. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, this may be an appropriate time to take the break.  Do you still have a long time to take with this witness?  If so, we may adjourn for a few minutes.  These proceedings are adjourned. 
(Court recessed from 1607H to 1634H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are resumed.

Mr. Prosecutor, you may continue with your cross-examination.  
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honours.  I wonder if, before I do, I can place on the record that before the break during the course of argument I said that there, perhaps, had been a translation error.  That in no way was meant to be a criticism of the translators.  And I certainly apologise if it was taken as such.  We have exceptionally good translators in this courtroom and their work is appreciated.  And I understand that, in fact, there had been no such error of translation.  So, I just wanted to put that on the record before I recommenced. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, before the break I had asked you who had said that Father Seromba had been protecting refugees.  And you said Ndungutse and Kayishema.  Are you saying that it was Ndungutse and Kayishema who were the ones making this comment? 
A.	Yes, it was Ndungutse and Kayishema who were saying that Father Seromba was housing the Inyenzi. 
Q.	Witness, you never told the Defence investigators, in February, anything at all about an allegation made against Father Seromba that he was housing refugees, did you? 
A.	I believe I answered depending on the questions that were put to me. 
Q.	Well, do you agree with me that you never said to the Defence investigators in February of this year that attackers were saying that Father Seromba was housing Inyenzi? 
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Nekuie.  
MR. NEKUIE:
The Defence wishes to raise an objection to this question unless the Prosecutor can reformulate the question, because he is asking the witness whether he remembers having failed to say to the investigators of the Defence that people were saying that Father Seromba was sheltering Tutsis.  If that is the question, Madam President, the Defence objects because this is not what came from the witness's testimony, and the Prosecutor knows this.  

If we can read one paragraph from this statement, on page three, it is said:  "Some Hutus claimed that President Habyarimana had been killed by the Inkotanyi, Inyenzi and were furious to see that assistance was given to Tutsi refugees.  And they launched attacks on the later."  From this statement, it is clear that the witness was referring to Father Seromba because he is the one who gave -- who had launched that appeal for assistance to the refugees. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is that how you formulate your objection to the question, Mr. Nekuie?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Madam President.  I'm asking that the Prosecutor reformulate his question because he cannot say that the witness failed to say that Father Seromba -- or that some people claimed that Father Seromba was sheltering Tutsis in his parish. 
MR. MOSES:
Does Your Honours want to hear from me, because my friend has read out the quote and nowhere in there does it refer to Father Seromba, which is exactly the point I am making.

With respect, it is not for my learned friend to add in comments, explanations about what is in the statement.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You can proceed, Mr. Prosecutor. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, I will repeat my question.  Do you agree that you did not tell the Defence investigators that attackers were saying that Father Seromba was housing refugees, or Inyenzi? 
A.	I confirm that I stated that it was being said that Father Seromba was sheltering Tutsis who were referred to further as Inyenzi. 
Q.	But you didn't say that, did you, when you spoke to the investigators in February of this year; that is correct, isn't it? 
A.	I believe that appears in my statement and I think I told them that people were saying that             Father Seromba was sheltering Inyenzis. 
Q.	When you say "you think you told them" did you tell them or not or your memory is not as good about the events back in February as it is now? 
A.	No, I didn't forget.  These words can be found in my statement. 
Q.	Well, we look forward to finding them.  I will move on.  Do I understand from your evidence that you were a traveling salesman selling various items of food stuff? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And on the 9th of April, how long did you spend at Nyange church? 
A.	On the 9th of April I told you that within the framework of my hawking, I didn't have to remain in a particular location for a long time.  I would move about here and there, and I couldn't remain in one given place for a long time.  I don't know whether you want to ask me if on the 9th of April and at a given point of time I went to the church; I don't know whether that is your question. 
Q.	My question is, how long did you spend at Nyange church on the 9th of April? 
A.	I don't think I ever said that on the 9th I went to the Nyange parish. 
Q.	Can you tell the Trial Chamber now; did you go to the church on the 9th of April or not? 
A.	I don't know whether you are understanding me properly.  I told you that on the 9th, the Tutsis were leaving the communal office in order to go to Nyange parish.  And I also told you that I saw them when they were making that transfer from the commune office to the Nyange parish.  Maybe you want to ask me -- you want to ask me the times during which that transfer was being done.  I don't know exactly where you were going. 
Q.	No, I will ask the questions, Witness.  On the 9th of April, simple question, did you go to Nyange church; yes or no? 
A.	I never went to the parish on the 9th of April. 
Q.	What day of the week was the 9th of April, Witness? 
A.	It was a Saturday, the 9th of April was a Saturday. 
Q.	Now, on the 10th of April, did you go to the church? 
A.	Yes, on the 10th I attended Mass at Nyange church. 
Q.	What time was the Mass that you attended? 
A.	Are you asking me the time, Mr. Prosecutor?  
Q.	Yes, that is right.
A.	I attended the second Mass. 
Q.	And was it Father Seromba who gave the homily at that second Mass? 
A.	He was the one who preached during the Mass.  And it was on that occasion that he called upon Christians to come to the assistance of the refugees who were at that parish. 
Q.	So if Father Seromba was to say, in fact, that it was another priest who spoke at the second Mass on the 10th of April, he would be lying, would he?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can the Prosecutor repeat his question for the benefit of the booth?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you please repeat the question, Mr. Prosecutor, for the interpreters?
BY MR. MOSES: 
Q.	If someone were to say that it was not Father Seromba but that it was another priest, namely,       Father Balthazar Habimana who spoke at the second Mass on that Sunday, the 10th of April, would that person be lying? 
A.	That would be that person's version of the facts, but as far as I am concerned it was Father Seromba who officiated during the Mass.  And he made an appeal to people on that occasion to come to the assistance of the refugees who were at the parish. 
Q.	Well, is it possible that you are mistaken, due to the length of time that it has been since the             10th of April, Witness, is it possible that you are mistaken and it wasn't Father Seromba who spoke on that occasion? 
A.	You know, Mr. Prosecutor, if a priest expresses himself by asking that the refugees be assisted, I cannot forget the person who spoke.  This was something involving a concrete issue, refugees who were there at the refugee -- at the parish, and I cannot forget that. 
Q.	And is that clear in your mind, is it?  It is very clear in your mind that it was Father Seromba who spoke? 
A.	Maybe you want me to repeat this term 1,000 times; Father Seromba said that people needed to do all they could to help the refugees.  And on the following day, even though I didn't attend Mass, he once again appealed to the Christians to come to the assistance of the refugees. 
Q.	Well, if Father Seromba were to say that on the Sunday morning, April 10, Father Balthazar Habimana returned, celebrated the second Mass and during the homily asked the Christians to be peaceable towards each other, would he be mistaken?  
A.	I didn't see that priest that you are speaking of. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  Now, in the days following the 10th of April up until, let's say, the 15th of April, if I can ask you to focus on that time period.  Now, did you go to the church every day? 
A.	Are you telling me that I should be at church every day?  No, I told you that I moved about in all corners of the neighbourhood within the framework of my trade, and I could not be at the church all of the time.  Furthermore, I indicated to you the times at which I was in church.  Take, for instance, the 11th, I told you that I didn't go to church on that day.  And if you want to ask me about the 12th, please go ahead and I will answer you. 
Q.	All right.  The 12th, did you go to the church in the course of your sales duties, did you go to the church on the 12th? 
A.	On the 12th I didn't go to the church; however, on the 13th I did go to church. 
Q.	All right.  On the 13th, how long did you spend at the church? 
A.	I told you, Mr. Prosecutor, that I was concerned about my trade.  I wasn't determining beforehand that I would remain at a particular place for a certain amount of time.  What I need to tell you and what you need to understand is that at a given point in time I was at the parish. 
Q.	How long did you remain there at this given point in time? 
A.	Do you want me to express that time in terms of hours and minutes?  
Q.	If you were there for hours, please say so; if you were there for minutes, also, please say so? 
A.	I remained there for a certain amount of time but I am unable to tell you for how long in terms of minutes because then I wasn't thinking that I would be asked questions about that.  Maybe you can ask me whether I saw anything at all. 
Q.	No, I think I will stay with how long you were there for, if you don't mind?  Now, were you there for less than half an hour or more than half an hour? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, if I were to try and estimate the time for which I remained there, I may even begin to tell lies.  You could even ask me what I saw while I was there, but as for the time, the amount of time I spent there, I wouldn't be able to give you any estimate whatsoever. 
Q.	Well, can you assist us in this way; were you walking passed the church, or did you stop and go inside of the church?  Were you selling things?  Can you give us a little bit more detail as to what you were actually doing there? 
A.	I was doing my sales, and I reached the church on the 13th; however, I wasn't looking at the watch or clock for me to determine how long I stayed there because that would presume that I knew how much time I was spending at all of the places through which I went. 
Q.	All right.  Let's move on to the 15th, shall we?  Have you any idea what time it was that you arrived that day, at Nyange? 
A.	I never went to the parish on the 15th.  However, I was somewhere close by the parish, more specifically, at the statue of the Virgin Mary. 
Q.	All right are you able to give us any indication as to how long it was that you had been at the statue of the Virgin Mary before the grenades were thrown? 
A.	I arrived in the afternoon. 
Q.	How long after you arrived did the grenades get thrown; was it is a short time, less than half an hour, a few minutes, a copy of hours?  Could you give us some idea? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, you are making matters difficult.  Ask me a question about whether or not I was there when the grenade was thrown, that is the type of question, otherwise you are making matters difficult with your questions. 
Q.	Well, you have told us that you have got a good memory of events.  I'm simply asking you to give some indication as to how long you had been there before the grenades were thrown.  Are you able to assist the Trial Chamber or not? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, even if you were to ask me how much time went by since I have been testifying here in this courtroom, I wouldn't be able to answer you.  Really, I can't answer that question, even less so can I answer the question of how long I was there before the grenade was thrown.  You can ask me a question about what I saw and whether or not the grenade was thrown, but not that other one. 
Q.	Now, you were, you told us, by the statue of the Virgin Mary; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I told you I was in front of the statue which is at the trading centre. 
Q.	Would you agree with me that there were thousands of attackers in the commercial centre and around the church, I'm not asking you to put a specific number, I'm just suggesting to you that there were thousands of attackers; would you agree with me? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I will confirm that there were many people, but I can't give an estimation.  I could see lots of people.  I don't know if there were thousands, there was no count taken of the people who were there. 
Q.	Just one point of clarification; your ethnic group is that of Hutu, is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I am a Hutu. 
Q.	Were there -- you have told us that there were many people?  Were these people between you and where the church was? 
A.	The people I could see were there near the statue that I mentioned. 
Q.	Were there many people in front of you, between you at the statue and where the church was? 
A.	If I told you that at the trading centre where there was the statue there were many people, I don't think I ever said that they were in front of me.  I said there were people.  I don't understand if you want to know if there were a lot of people in front of me or behind me.  Because of my job, I moved around a lot, but I'm not quite sure what you are talking about when you are talking about people who were in front of me. 
Q.	I'm talking about the position that you were at the statue and the church.  Between you and the church were there many attackers, or were you at the front of the group of attackers? 
A.	I was never at the head.  I said that I was at the statue. 
Q.	Well, if you weren't at the head would you agree that there were attackers between you and the church? 
A.	I don't know what you are expecting of me.  I told you there were many people where the statue was, so I don't know what you expect.  I told you there were people around the statue.  Maybe I don't understand your question.  I said there were people, but I was talking about the place where the statue was.  That is where there were lots of people. 
Q.	Were they -- those people by the statue, were they the attackers? 
A.	Yes, there were attackers around the statue. 
Q.	Were there any attackers in front of where the statue is, that is near the shops at Nyange commercial centre which are between the statue and the church, were there any attackers there? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, did you understand the question that the Prosecutor asked you?  
THE WITNESS:
I don't really understand the question.  I have repeated that there were many people around the statue.  I said that there were many people at the statue.  I said, "Yes there were," but I also said that I couldn't give you an estimation of how many people were there.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	The focus of my question now isn't about around the statue.  I'm talking about the area in front of the statue by the shops which lead from the statue up to Nyange church.  Now, were there any attackers by those shops? 
A.	Yes, I saw the attackers.  I had told you that a grenade was thrown while I was there, there were some attackers who threw it, I saw it. 
Q.	The attackers who were by the shop were they between where you were standing and the church? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I told you that I moved around with various items for sale.  The grenade was thrown while I was there.  I told you that when it was thrown I was there at the statue.  For the rest, I don't understand your question. 
Q.	Well can I suggest you listen carefully to the questions, please, Witness, and try to answer the questions.  From where you were standing in front of the statue of the Virgin Mary, could you see the area in front of the secretariat -- I'm sorry, that is the church secretariat? 
A.	I'm not sure if you are aware of how the area is laid out.  Someone who was at the statue would be in a position to see farther up at the parish.  
Q.	Is it your evidence that you could see? 
A.	No, anyone at the statue would have a view of the parish. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, I must admit -- yes, we have an objection, Madam President.  We don't understand the Prosecutor's question.  He is asking the witness, "Could you see?"  Could you see what?  I must acknowledge that I am a bit surprised by the nature of his question.  Could he rephrase it so that the witness can answer it.  He is not clear as to what can and cannot be seen from that site. 
MR. MOSES:
All right.  I will ask that the witness be shown a photocopy of Prosecution Exhibit P. 3-16. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, can you see -- what -- can you recognise the scene that is shown in that photograph? 
A.	The photograph in front of me is not entirely clear to me.  I don't understand it fully. 
Q.	You don't recognise the scene shown in that photograph? 
A.	The photograph is unclear.  I can see that the photograph is unclear. 
Q.	It has been a long time, Witness, since these events back in 1994.  
A.	That is not what I said.  Even though the photograph is unclear, I can recognise the site of the Codekoki.  There are some buildings I don't see on the photograph that were there at the time; some buildings are not represented on this photograph.  That is what I can say. 
Q.	Can you please mark for us where the Codekoki building is in that photograph?  Perhaps if you can put the number 1 next to the building you say is the Codekoki building?  
A.	I can also see -- or, in fact, I am not able to locate the spot where the statue was.  I know the place, and I can identify the spot for you but I don't know if you want me to.  Do you want me to point it out for you?  I have seen it now. 
Q.	Yes, if you could put the number 1 on the building that you say is the Codekoki?  Have you done that, Witness?   Can you please write the number 1 on the building that you say is the Codekoki? 
A.	I keep looking at the photo, it is still unclear.  I can't find my way around.  I can see the site of the statue of the Virgin Mary. 
Q.	Well, can you please mark --  
A.	I can identify the spot where the statue of the Virgin Mary was.  But with regard to the building that housed Codekoki, I can't find it.  There may have been some changes.  There are some buildings that I don't see any more.  The only spot that I can identify for you is that where the statue was. 
Q.	All right, can you mark there then; mark the place where the statue was?  And before you pass it, are you able to see in that photograph or point in the direction where the church was before it was destroyed? 
A.	Yes, I can show you the direction of the church. 
Q.	All right, if you could write the number 2 on that document in the approximate position where you say the church was?

So just for the record, the number 1 indicates where you say the statue was and the number 2 is where the church was before it was destroyed; am I right?  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Objection, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, what is your objection?  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
My objection is that I have not yet seen the photograph.  The Prosecutor asked the witness to indicate the direction the church was in and not the location of the church itself.  You asked the witness to indicate the direction of the destroyed church.  Don't say now that number 2 indicates where the church actually was.  That is my objection, Madam President. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, as you are the one testifying --  
MR. MOSES:
Can it be handed back to the witness, please?  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	As it is your evidence that is important, what does number 2 indicate? 
A.	I believe that I told you that I am a bit uncomfortable with this photograph, it is a bit dark.  The place that I have identified correctly is the place that I have identified; otherwise, I did express some reservation, because the photograph is a bit dark.  I also have a problem with my eyesight.  Just ask me questions and I will explain things to you.  I can describe the area, or please give me a clearer photograph. 
Q.	Just -- perhaps if you put your glasses on, if that will help your eyesight, Witness.  What I'm interested to know is the number 2 there, is that -- what have you marked as number 2? 
A.	Is there another more clear version of this photograph; it would come back to the same thing?  
Q.	I don't know if the one that has just been handed to you is any clearer, if it is, by all means.  Just so we are all clear, could you just tell us what number 1 indicates and number 2 indicates on the copy that you have just marked so that there is no dispute at a later time? 
A.	Number 1 indicates the location of the statue of the Virgin Mary.  However, I am not able to see the buildings that were below the area where the statue was, there were buildings there at the time. 
Q.	All right, and number 2? 
A.	Number 2 indicates the road that leads up to the church and parish.

1730H 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Okay.  Well, using--
A.	Your photos are unclear. 
Q.	Well, they're the best we've got at the moment, Witness.  Are you able to now mark, using the pen, a number 3, indicate where you recall the church being back in 1994? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, Witness, do you hear me, Witness?  If you see that place on the photograph, please indicate it.  If you do not see it, please say so.  Please put a number 3 if you see that location. 
THE WITNESS:
I will say once again that the photo is dark and I have a problem with my eyesight.  I am able to identify the spot where the statue was; however, I do not see the buildings that were below the statue.  But I can confirm this is the spot where the statue was.  With regard to the other sites, it's unclear to me. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Objection, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Monthé?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I don't know what they're trying to get out of this witness.  He's already given the answers, and he expressed reservations with regard to the quality of the photograph.  He also said that he has problems with his eyesight.  I don't know what the Prosecutor is trying to get out of him.  He says, "I have indicated the direction of the church."  He doesn't know more than that. 
MR. MOSES:
If he knows no more than that, well, that's fine, and it's a matter which no doubt we will all take note of.  Your Honours, that's my response to my friend's question.  I'm happy to move on with my next question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Do you still wish to ask him about the photograph he has with him, or are you moving on to something else?  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, are you able to see in that photograph the building which was the church secretariat building? 
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Nekuie?  
MR. NEKUIE:
The Defence has the same objection.  The question is the exact same one.  He has been asked to identify on this photograph -- to identify where the church was, or the secretariat was.  It's the exact same question.  We cannot now mention the secretariat in view of the church.  If you can see the church, obviously the secretariat as well.  It's the same question. 
THE WITNESS:
The photograph is not clear.  If the Prosecutor wishes, I can explain the layout and say where the secretariat was.  I'm saying that the photograph is not clear and that I have a problem with my eyesight. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Did you have this problem with your eyesight back in 1994, Witness?  
A.	My problem with my eyesight has been there for only six months. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, yes, you want to ask another question?  
MR. MOSES:
I'm moving on from that. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, just to confirm one point -- final point about this -- the matters on the 15th.  Is it -- am I correct that you didn't see any other priests, any priests at all on that day, on the 15th, at any time? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I believe I have sufficiently explained to you about this date.  I told you that when I saw the priest for the last time, I saw the priest on the 10th and on the 13th.  I don't know whether you want me to incessantly repeat my answer. 
Q.	That's fine.  Where did you see Father Seromba on the 13th?  Where was he? 
A.	(No interpretation)
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, objection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Monthé?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
The witness never said he saw the priest on the 15th.  He said the 10th and 13th. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, but you are referring to the 15th, Mr. Prosecutor.  Maybe it's been the interpretation, because we heard the 15th.  You spoke of the 13th, did you?  It should have been the 13th and not the 15th. 
THE WITNESS:
I indeed mentioned the 10th and the 13th.  It was on the 13th that I saw him when he was asking people to come to the assistance of the refugees.  I wasn't asked whether I saw him on the 15th.  That question has not yet been put to me. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Where did you see Father Seromba on the 13th?  Where was he? 
A.	He was quite close to the building housing the secretariat.  He was visibly quite sad, very sad. 
Q.	Well, I'm concentrating at this stage on where he was.  When you say he was close to the secretariat, was he outside the priests' compound?  Do you understand my question? 
A.	If I told him -- if I told you that I saw him on the 13th in front of the secretariat office, this means that he was not inside the church.  I told you that he was in front of the secretariat. 
Q.	So if it was to be suggested in this court that Father Seromba didn't leave his premises, namely, the priests' compound, from the 10th of April to the 16th of April, that wouldn't be correct according to what you saw? 
A.	Can you repeat your question, please?  I didn't understand its meaning.  I told you when I saw him.  I don't know whether you need further explanation. 
Q.	If someone was to say that the priests were in the rectory where they were hiding, in fear, from April the 10th until April the 17th, would that statement not be correct, according to you? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I told you that I'm relating to you facts of which I was an eyewitness, and I told you that I saw him on the 10th and the 13th.  And if I say that, it means that I, indeed, saw him.  Now, coming to that suggestion, this deals with another person.  But as for myself, I'm telling you what I (microphones overlapping) -- unless you're saying that someone allegedly suggested that I saw the priest on the    15th and the 16th.  But as far as I can tell you, I'm saying what I saw, and I saw him. 
Q.	All right.  Let's move on to the 16th, shall we?  Did I understand your evidence correctly that you did not arrive in the vicinity of Nyange church until the walls of the church were destroyed; is that right? 
A.	Let me repeat it.  When it was said that the church had been destroyed, I went to Nyange in the afternoon and, indeed, I saw that the church had been destroyed and that it was only the bell tower that remained.  The bulldozer came in to destroy the bell tower, and when the bell tower fell, I immediately left. 
Q.	Were you in a similar position to that which you were in the previous day, or did you get closer to the church? 
A.	On that day I went to the church, and I told you that I was supposed to go there without my parents knowing.  Now, on the 16th I was at the church, at the Nyange church, in the afternoon. 
Q.	Would you agree with me that you couldn't get very close to the church, to the situation at Nyange church, because it was very dangerous, and the assailants were very many in number? 
A.	I don't know whether you understand.  When I speak about the church, and when I said that I went to the church, it means that I went there.  I saw the events that happened at the church.  I got there and I witnessed the events, and I've told you what I saw. 
Q.	Will you listen to my question, please, Witness, and answer my question.  Would you agree with me that you could not move very close because the situation was very dangerous, and the assailants were very many; is that statement correct or not? 
A.	That wouldn't be the truth. 
Q.	Well, didn't you say those very words to the Defence investigators when you met them in February last year -- sorry, February this year? 
A.	What words were those?  On the 16th I got to the church after it was destroyed, and it was only the bell tower that was standing.  I got there when the bulldozer was destroying that bell tower, and the bell tower came down while I was there.  I believe I stated this, and these are events that I witnessed myself. 
Q.	Witness, I'm going to have a passage from your statement that you made earlier this year to the Defence read out to you.  
MR. MOSES:
Your Honours, if I can refer you, please, to page 4 of that statement.  It's the fifth paragraph on that page and it begins, "En vérité," and I will just ask that the statement's taken to the French booth so that they can translate it for the witness.  If I could ask the French booth to read out that paragraph. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
This is the reading:   "In truth, I could not get too close because the situation was dangerous, and the attackers were very many.  However, I saw the caterpillar destroy the bell tower of the church, and the attackers had made a queue on both sides of the machine."  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	That's what you told the Defence when you spoke to them in February of this year, isn't it? 
A.	I have something to say about that extract.  I don't know whether you asked me whether I had seen this or not.  In fact, there were many people, and this did not stop me from seeing what I saw.  It is true that there were many people who had participated in the attacks, but I think that it is quite clear that it was the bulldozer which was destroying the bell tower.  I'm, indeed, telling you that I saw the bulldozer as it was destroying the bell tower, and I stand by my statement according to which I said -- I said that I saw the bulldozer as it was destroying the tower, and I think, according to the reading that has been done, there is no difference.  I do not know whether you want to tell me that there were many people who would have stopped my -- seeing what was happening.  Well, that was not the case, because I saw what happened, and I have said as much.  If, from the reading, you claim that I saw the bulldozer as it was destroying the bell tower, yes, I'm confirming that I did see it. 
Q.	Have you finished, Witness?  I don't want to interrupt you.  
A.	Yes, I'm done. 
Q.	I read to you from your statement, didn't I, a passage which said that you could not move very close because the situation was dangerous and the assailants were many.  I said, "Would that be the truth?"  And you said, "No, it wouldn't."  That's just what you said to the Defence, isn't it, in February of this year, no?  That's correct, isn't it? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I never stated that I did not see what was happening.  But seeing and not getting close is different.  There were many people.  I didn't observe from very close, but I was nonetheless able to see what was happening.  I didn't want to take the risk of getting too close to the place.  But from where I was, I could well see with my own eyes what was happening, and that's what I testified to -- that's what I stated, I beg your pardon. 
Q.	And there were people surrounding the caterpillar; is that right? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I really don't understand what you mean by "surrounding".  I told you that there were many people.  I don't know if that's what you mean by "surrounding".  From the reading which you have just had done, mention is made of the fact that I saw the bulldozer.  I don't know whether you thereby mean to say that the people had surrounded that bulldozer and, therefore, I couldn't see it.  I don't know whether that's what you mean to say. 
Q.	There were lots of attackers, weren't there, who were surrounding the bulldozer?  That's my question.  Do you agree with me or not? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I do agree with you that there were many people present, but I do not agree with you when you say that those people could stop me from seeing the bulldozer.  I do not agree with that suggestion you're making. 
Q.	Now, who was the bourgmestre of your commune at that time, 1994? 
A.	I have forgotten the name.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Said the witness in a low voice. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	If I was to suggest the name of Grégoire Ndahimana, does that assist you? 
A.	Very well. 
Q.	Well, do you remember it being Grégoire Ndahimana or don't you? 
A.	Yes, he was the bourgmestre. 
Q.	He was the most important communal official, wasn't he, in the commune? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I don't know what you want to suggest thereby. 
Q.	I'm not suggesting anything.  Can you please just listen to my question.  I'm not trying to trick you.  It's a simple question.  Would you agree with me that the bourgmestre was the most important communal official "yes" or "no"? 
A.	Indeed.  The bourgmestre is the highest authority in the commune. 
Q.	Did you see him on either the 15th or the 16th? 
A.	I never saw him.  Amongst those whom I saw, I didn't see him.  I didn't have the intent of knowing everyone who was present at the time. 
MR. MOSES:
Your Honours, that's -- those are all the questions I have for cross-examination. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. MOSES:
Before I do sit down, if we could have the photograph which is marked, produced, formally as Prosecution Exhibit 32 or 33, I believe. 
THE WITNESS:
I don't know whether I can add anything to what I've already said.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness?  Yes, Mr. Witness?
THE WITNESS:
I would like to ask you to continue searching for the truth so that those who are innocent can be released and for criminals to be arrested.  That is my request, and I would also request that I be able to greet the priest, and I also wish to have from you a certificate according to which I have testified before this Chamber. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you will see Mr. Monthé regarding your requests.  I think Mr. Monthé has begun to do the needful (sic) so that this helps all the witnesses here.  We are here to seek out the truth, and that is our role. 

Mr. Prosecutor, you were asking the admission of this document as an exhibit for the Prosecution?  No objection from the Defence?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, the Defence has an objection concerning this document.  The witness said on several times that this photograph wasn't clear, so I do not see how we can have any submissions on this because he has challenged the quality of this document.  He said it is not clear and he cannot find his way about.  So I am a bit surprised that the Prosecution wishes to insist that this document be admitted, because the witness has dwelt at length on the poor quality of the photograph, and I wish to have this placed on the record. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What you have said has been placed on record, indeed.  The document is admitted as Prosecution Exhibit --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sure Your Honour wishes to say --  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is a Prosecution document; it's not a Defence document; and it is P. 33. 
(Exhibit No. P. 33 admitted)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you wish to have re-examination of this witness, Mr. Nekuie?  
MR. NEKUIE:
No, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  We thank you. 

Mr. Witness, you have come to the end of your testimony before this Tribunal.  We thank you sincerely for having come, and for having answered the questions put to you.  We wish you a safe return home.  Thank you very much. 
THE WITNESS:
I also wish to thank you.  
(Witness excused) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
With regard to the witnesses that we have had here, I believe there is only one who has yet to be cross-examined by the Prosecution; that's BZ5.  Tomorrow I believe we can proceed to the cross-examination of that witness, BZ5, and then which would be the next witness, Mr. Monthé, for the Defence?  I believe it's FE14 and FE25, FE26. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, FE35, FE36, and CF14 are present, and they only speak in Kinyarwanda and, given the difficulties we had with them, BZ5 will pass tomorrow, and I believe we will be able to do something with the witnesses who are there.  I don't know because we have a very tight schedule.  They arrived much later than had been expected because they had delays in leaving Rwanda, so we do have some management problems, given our timetable. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor?  
MR. MOSES:
Last week I understood the Defence to say that the witness BZ8 was travelling and would be the next witness to testify.  But it may have been that BZ8 is simply not here, but it was our understanding that BZ8, who had been unwell and couldn't travel with the initial six or seven witnesses, and the Defence had been advised that he was now in a position to travel, to give evidence this week.  So I simply want some clarification, if I can, from my learned friend as to whether or not BZ8 is to give evidence and, if so, when. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I believe that wasn't the object of the question you put to me.  You asked me whether FE35, FE36, and CF14 were here, and I said that I'd already respectfully said that they would arrive, and I'm confirming that they are present.  I was informing the Chamber of the situation, which was an obvious one, and one needs to check this with them.  These were detainees, and they have just been released, and we haven't had the time to see them as we had intended.  

Now, I can respond to the Prosecutor concerning BZ8.  As we were in session, the WVSS told me that BZ8 had arrived.  I don't know what state he or she is in and, therefore, I cannot say anything.  But I can, indeed, confirm that apparently Witness BZ8 has come.  Now, as for management issues, I'm just informing you that these are serious problems and we have to deal with this in the best way we can. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  I believe tomorrow may be the cross-examination of BZ5 -- will not take all of tomorrow afternoon, will it?  No?  Very well.  So, Counsel Monthé, if you can kindly determine who will be the next witness for tomorrow; among the four that you have mentioned, what would best suit the Defence so that we can continue and not interrupt our session tomorrow afternoon, if possible.  We thank you all and we are now going to adjourn.  We wish you a good evening and we will see you tomorrow at 1430 (sic).
