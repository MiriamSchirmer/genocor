P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody.

Mr. Registrar, could you introduce the proceedings? 
MR. FRY:  
Yes, Your Honour.  

Trial Chamber III, of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Short and Judge Kama is now sitting in open session, today, Monday, the 24th of October 2005, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor vs. Karemera et al, 
Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.

Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.

Now, we are in a new courtroom, Courtroom IV as supposed, I think we should just take appearances 
MR. WEBSTER:  
     Good morning, Your Honours.  Good morning to the Defence, Bench and to the Registry.

     Prosecution is today represented by myself, Don Webster.  Also present is our associate 
legal officer, Takeh Sendze, in essence the appearances are the same as the events since the beginning of the trial, but we are represented today in the courtroom by two counsel.

Thank you.   
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.
MR. SOW: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  And good morning to Your Honours.  My name is Moussa Felix Sow, co-counsel for Mr. Edourd Karemera.  I am assisted by Leopold Nsengiyumva.  I take this opportunity, Mr.  President, Your Honours, to inform you that I am sitting to represent Mr. Weyl and Ms. Chantal Hounkpatin who are absent and they represent Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  
 
      I thank you, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Good morning, Mr. President, members of the Trial Chamber.  Peter Robinson for Joseph Nzirorera. I am also assisted by Leopold Nsengiyumva and our interns will be arriving some during this session Russell Hopkins and Georgina Mensah-Datsa.

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Mr. Witness, again I call you FG.  I do not have as yet a report on the matter I undertook to make.  We are moving forward with that and I will expect that we have a report soon.

Yes, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President, I have a brief application with respect to Mr. Mbonyunkiza, the issue of his passport and that is, I would like to enquire if the Trial Chamber have received information concerning charges pending against Mr. Mbonyunkiza, or issues related to his being wanted by the Rwandan government, and then of course of its inquiries that should be disclosed to the Defence as potentially excupulatry material.  I have some information that leaves me to believe that the reason that the passport is being withheld from Mr. Mbonyunkiza is that the Witness Victim Section has information that there are charges pending or other matters within Rwanda that led them to want to retain his passport.  If that is the case, those communications and information has been communicated to either the Prosecutor or the Trial Chamber.  I believe that that should be provided to the Defence, that it might be relevant to the credibility and to the cross-examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We had not thought it necessary to say what - - where we were at this stage, but in view of enquiry, I should inform you that we have not had any formal information up to now and the actual step that is being taken at the moment is to require the registry to supply submissions.  We think, however, those submissions should be supplied, confidentially, once we receive them we will decide whether they should be disclosed.  So that is the state of our knowledge at the moment.  I would assume that the Prosecutor would be complying with their disclosure - - with their applications, but I can't comment on what, if any information, the Prosecutor has. 
MR. WEBSTER:  
Perhaps I should comment briefly, Your Honour.  I am aware that there was an allegation of an episode that the witness perceived to be one of intimidation in Rwanda months ago.  And as a result of that an investigation was undertaken locally in Rwanda, and I do not know the nature or extent of the investigation.  I know the entire episode is rather complex, I don't have complete information.  It's a matter that I addressed with WVSS, and they basically took the ball and wrung it.  It's an issue which I think is going to confuse matters in this trial.  I don't have any information to disclose.  WVSS has been the custodian and recipient of all the information and this is something I would prefer we would not bring into the trial, but at the extent Mr. Robinson has raised it as an issue; I felt compelled to respond briefly. I rely on the court's discretion as to whatever documentation they receive from the President or from the Registry.  And, we will proceed on as directed to proceed.  But based on my limited knowledge of the matter and based on my conversations with the witness, this is an episode which is as confusing as which would merit a mini-trail in and on itself and has nothing to do with the substance of the issues that we were addressing in this trial.  So, I would prefer that it be dealt with as a completely separate issue, but I will limit myself to that and I am willing to follow any directions that, I receive from the Court in this regard. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Webster.

Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:   
Mr. President, listening to what has been said over the last few minutes, is very confusing for me; both Mr., Webster's comments and to some extent the trail Chamber's.  If there is information that this witness -- there is some allegation of wrongdoing by this witness, whether they are true or not, whether they are confusing or simply that information has to be supplied to the Defence, I have no idea what 
Mr. Webster just said, what he is alluding to, an episode is confusing.  If this-- if there is an allegation of wrongdoing by this witness it goes to his credibility and it needs to be disclosed.  Here I am, and I thought it might be the last day of my cross-examination, and there is now-- finding out material that nobody has been forthcoming about and it is -- in my opinion, if Mr. Webster has something about some confusing episode that relates to this witness's credibility, it should have been disclosed under Rule 68; it's a violation of the Rule 68, to be here on my last day of cross-examination, trying to read the 
tea leaves to what Mr. Webster is trying to say.  So, I would ask the Trial Chamber to, number one; order Mr. Webster to disclose all information that might affect the credibility of this witness, whether he deems it confusing or not.  

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, the problem we have in making an order is that you have not crossed the threshold of demonstrating that Mr. Webster has information which imposes an obligation under Rule 68.  Now, we feel that if Mr. Webster has information under Rule 68, he should disclose it.  But we can't make an order because it has not been shown that he has information which he has not disclosed. But I don't know if he can say anything more at this stage. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay, I understand that, Mr. President, and I would ask at this time if you could enquire to Mr. Webster directly, if he has any information that affects the credibility of this witness concerning the confusing episode which he has alluded to.  I don't have the right to go into his files and check what he has to make the showing for you.  I think it has been enough, from what Mr. Webster has said, to coerce the Court to make further enquiries, and I would ask that you do that so that we can have some clarity on this.  Otherwise, we would be dealing with this matter of Rule 68 material after the witness has left. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I don't think I should ask Mr. Webster anything.  I think the matter is on the table.  We have to respect Mr. Webster's personality.  And, if he has anything to disclose, he would do it.  I think that the matter is sufficient on the table for us to rely on the exercise of his professional discretion. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I simply want to make one brief comment.  I believe I stated this a few minutes ago; the issue that 
Mr. Robinson is alluding that under that, the Court maybe addressing, quite frankly, I don't know what the Court is addressing with WVSS, but the incident that I assume, Mr. Robinson is referring to came to my attention as a matter of witness intimidation and in addressing the issue of witness intimidation, I raised the issue with WVSS.  I released the issue to them and WVSS has been dealing with it.  I have nothing in contact with anyone in Rwanda about this issue.  As I understand it, the communication has been between WVSS and anyone that has information relevant to this issue.  So, I have nothing to disclose other than my own knowledge of the incident, and my knowledge is incomplete because it's based on piecemeal conversation with the witness and with WVSS.  But I would be happy to follow the Court's instructions:  As far as I know; I have lived up to our obligations under Rule 68. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I ask the Trial Chamber then to make an order that the WVSS should provide to the parties, the Defence and the Prosecution, any information it has concerning the incident referred to by Mr. Webster, since the WVSS is under the auspicious of the Trial Chamber for disclosure purposes, rather, than the Prosecutor.  And since Mr. Webster isn't willing to disclose anything.  I think that seems to be the most appropriate course of action as to have disclosed - - to dispose to the parties and to the 
Trial Chamber, the facts, so that we can decide whether or not they can be used for credibility.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, as far as I know, the WVSS is not a party to these proceedings.  So, if Mr. Robinson wants to rely on Rule 68, and any of the rules of disclosure to reach out and find information, Rule 68 is certainly not the vehicle to do that.  Rule 68 governs the relationship between the parties.  WVSS is an independent entity to the registry; their primary concern is the safety and well-being of witnesses.  My submission is that this Court, based on Mr. Robinson's application, does not have the authority to go and order the WVSS to do anything in relation to this witness.  Now, we are all here for-- to advance the wheels of justice.  Prosecution is not suggesting that anything be hidden from the public or from the Defence or from the Court, for we also have to keep our eye on the ball here, and the issue for us is the substance of the issues in this trial and what I suggest is that Mr. Robinson seems to be on a fishing expedition to move to shift the focus in this witness's testimony away form the evidence that he has to give, the issues that are really extraneous to his testimony.  So, I will simply conclude there that I would not wish to see this issue become the centre of this witness's testimony in the centre of his trial, and our focus should be on the events that this witness has to recall in relation to '92 and '93, and '94. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, in view of your application, we have already indicated that we have decided to ask the registry to make submissions.  We don't think another order is justified.  We expect that-- we expect compliance with that.  And once that has been -- compliance has been made, it will put us in a position to make a reasoned decision as to what the next step should be, reasoned and informed. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay, Mr. President, I will await that and I am ready to go forward with my cross--examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.    
AHMED NAPOLÉON MBONYUNKIZA
CROSS EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Mr. Mbonyunkiza?
A.	Bonjour, maitre, Robinson.
Q.	So, I am ready to ask you some more questions about the incident in which you were assaulted in 
	May of 1992, and you told you us you went to see Mr. Ngirumpatse at his office in the Kabuga building.  And when we left off on Friday, I had shown you your interview of 2001 in which you had said that you had gone to see him at the ministry of justice.  And I believe you have testified that that was a mistake by the investigators; is that correct? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, we are not able to speak on the mike when we have the Kinyarwanda booth on.  So, I think there is a technical breach somewhere. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You have problems, there? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Yes, I think we are on; maybe we could try with the witness.  No. Try again.  Kinyarwanda booth, is testing, we are on A.  Okay.  Yes, we can hear you now.  This is the English booth receiving the Kinyarwanda booth loud and clear.  Can the floor hear me from the English booth?  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, we have been informed that we can get English on channel four, and I have been hearing it now.  I don't know if -- 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  Thank you, Mr. President.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I am just going to re-ask this question to you because I didn't get your answer in English, and that is that you have told us that the reason the ministry of justice has mentioned on your statement as the place you went to, when you were injured in early May, was because of a mistake of the investigators; correct? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel Robinson.  Before we continue, I have something to say about what you were discussing earlier.  Don't blame the government of Rwanda for anything; the witness section has made a terrible mistake.  I had indicated that I was going to explain all of this, but I don't want to get ahead of myself.  I believe that some of you are even involved in this matter, but we should not blame the Rwandan government for anything, because as we begin to deal with these matters, people start to think that the Rwandan government is looking for Ahmed Mbonyunkiza, and that is not true.  I have no problem with the Rwandan government, and that should be clear because as we start to look at the problem, people will end up thinking that there might be something very serious, and in fact that is not the case.  I said that I had problems, but in fact, I did not want to explain them earlier on.  I am concentrating on the testimony I have to give.  I can also talk about those problems at the appropriate time.  So it almost seems that in this Tribunal there is some type of intimidation.  We have seen the same in Rwanda when they use other people to do so, but, in fact, in this case, the Rwandan government has nothing to do with that intimidation that must be clear.  I can say it in public.  Someone in the witness section is involved in this matter, and we have to look into that to shed light on this matter.  But now, let's move on with my testimony.  I saw that you were talking about a problem and it seems that the explanation that was given was not sufficient.  I am telling you the truth.  I have no problems with the Rwandan government.  That should be clear.  Otherwise, I think that I will have an opportunity later to talk about those problems to the competent authorities.  It's a complicated matter, Counsel.  I don't know what the staff in the witness section is doing.  They contradict everyone and I am very surprised about that.  You said that you had some information.  Certainly, you have sources, Counsel, for that.  I have seen that there are all kinds of forms of intimidation and as the situation moved - - on, I said that I wasn't going to seek to get the passport back, and that we would look at the issue gradually, but there are people who were just making the situation worse.  We began that matter, I told you, Mr. President that I will expose my problem which I have and serious problem, but you, you have - - say led me quickly to tell Mr. President that there is something which is not in a good way.  I am telling you there is a problem which is done by you persons here, there, in Kigali, and the things I explained to Mr. President, so you give me an appointment with him, I will explain to him, but he is not going to bring here that witness to show his security and so on.  I don't have any problem with the government of Rwanda, my friend, I am telling you.  And I wrote to WVSS since June, when I heard that intimidation, since June my friend and WVSS:  There is a lot of things to say.  I don't enter into detail.  I will tell Mr. President and the persons who are responsible to take decisions accordingly, but not to bring these things to disturb here - - this courtroom to disturb the courtroom and to enter to disturb also my security also inside of court.  Mr. President, I am obliged to tell you that, but I am very sorry because today I came to continue and at least finish what brought me here to finish that.  It is not to come every day everything, small things.  I have a problem, I have problem my problem which is serious even if I was going to be killed and you have to know that and perhaps it is your persons who came there, but, 
	I am telling you is not the government of Rwanda.  That I want to underline that.  Listen, to inform this courtroom that the government of Rwanda is not following me.  Is not looking for me, but something is being organised by you, by those guys of WVSS openly.  I say that if you want to know, and I will explain in the future, and the future will tell us.  But don't intimidate me in this courtroom.  Those things which I want to underline.  And Mr. President, sorry for that because it's a big way and a big serious big way to eliminate my life and my family also.  The reason they asked or where is -- what is the name of your wife?  What is the name of your children?  What is the name of your relatives and so on?  And you remember your mum, your advocate, your colleague; she asked me - - she told me that the reason why the government put you outside the reason to come, and charge our customers here or client she told that.  You remember she said that the government released you because of coming here check - - 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr.  Witness, Mr. Witness, time to get focused again, on why you are here, and at the moment you have to respond to the questions put by counsel.  You understand that?  Okay. 
THE WITNESS:
I do understand, Mr. President, and pardon me, but I wanted to get that message through.  I have been patient and I have always wanted to testify and get my testimony across, but I am having problems.  I have told you that I am facing many different problems, and now counsel has come back to these issues. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, I think you should just be patient and answer the questions you are asked.  The issues will be addressed properly in due course.  Okay.  Yes. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q. Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I just want to tell you first of all if I said something which is not accurate about your current  situation with the government of Rwanda, I apologise to you and honestly I don't have  any sufficient information to even ask you questions about that right now.  That's my problem.  Okay, because apparently, you, the Prosecutor and to some extent the Trial Chamber know what the situation involves and I don't.  And you have seen me in my cross-examination I have your prior statements, I have my information, and I am able to question you intelligently about matters, about your testimony, because I have that kind of preparation.  On this big problem that you are alluding to I have none of that.  Okay.  If I said something that was inaccurate, I apologise to you, and I am seeking from everyone, from Mr. Webster, from the Trial Chamber, from WVSS, to put the Defence on equal footing so that we can have an intelligent cross-examination of you, and we could complete that today.  
Now, the Trial Chamber has told us that we will work on that problem, and we will come back to it.  But, if I had said anything that offends you in any way, I can assure you that it's not intentional on my part.  And, I will assure you that there is no intimidation of you coming from Mr. Nzirorera or me in anyway.  In fact, I have been hampered by the fact that I have not been able to do a decent investigation in Rwanda on your allegations.  So, I want to assure you that there is no intimidation coming from the Defence, and I hope that we will finally get enough information about your situation that you have been alluding to, to  conduct a proper cross-examination on those matters.

But for now, let's come back to the things that I am prepared on, that I do have information on, and that involves the incident concerning your assault in May of 1992.  Okay? 
A.	Are you referring to May 1992?  Are we still talking about that event in May 1992?  Yes, we can go back over it if you wish.  With regard to that other matter, we can get back to it later, but we have to tell the truth.  Sometimes we conceal the truth; we have to tell the truth.  You are the one who brought that up and you said that you don't know anything, I am very surprised.  Perhaps it's not you or Nzirorera but someone else on the Defence side, the fact remains, and the situation is there.  Let's go on with the other questions.  There are competent bodies to conduct an enquiry and protect me.  I trust this Tribunal and the Rwandan government.  I think that, together, they will shed light on this issue.  So let's move on, Counsel Robinson, we can put that issue aside for now.  I think that the Tribunal has the authority but we must understand there are other issues that are problematic in these proceedings.  I don't want to dwell on this.  I want to get into my testimony.  In fact the people who confiscated my passport are distorting the issue.  In all respects, let us now talk about this incident in May 1992.  Let's move forward if you want to.
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  So, you again have told us that the fact in the statement of January 2001, it was stated that Mr. Ngirumpatse, you had gone to see him at the ministry of defence, was a mistake made by the investigator.  Now, what I want to ask you is that you again met with the investigators on the 30th of May 2003.  And during that time they showed you your statement of January 2001, and they gave you the opportunity to tell them if there was anything that needed to be corrected.  Isn't that true? 
A.	Mr. Robinson, please understand what I am telling you:  I am a truthful witness.  I have no interest in telling lies.  Furthermore, that is why you should always look for similar and credible witnesses.  I am not here before the Chamber to tell lies.  There are some things that I have corrected.  Let's first talk about 2005.  When I arrived here, I had some mistakes that I had to point out.  In a statement, they said that Karemera had financed some activities that I talked about.  They wrote that Mathieu financed the RTLM that is not correct. That is not what I said.  I said that they set up the Interahamwe movement and they coordinated its activities.  With regard to Karemera, he provided funds or distributed funds for awareness building of the MRND party.  Those are some of the mistakes that I pointed out and corrected.  I did not say that he financed all of the activities of the genocide.  These things were put down on paper in 1993.  And you are asking me if I made corrections?  What I am saying is that I am right here before you, physically, in front of this Chamber.  I am telling you the truth.  Don't simply rely on the document because there will be mistakes therein.  You are, Counsel for Joseph Karemera, you are there and if you rely on what is said about Karemera and his financing of the genocide, are you going to consider that information as truthful?  Let's look at Ngirumpatse, do you know all about RTLM?  Are we going to blame everything the RTLM did on Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and of admonish all those who worked for RTLM?  No, I am here to tell you the true.  Let me repeat myself:  I am not going to change my testimony.  I am truthful.    If a statement was taken down, and in the statement there are mistakes, those mistakes are attributable to those who took the statement.  I am telling you that I am here before you, and I am telling you the truth.  Do you understand me, Counsel?  I am telling you the truth.  I will tell the truth until the day I die. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The Chamber will allow you some freedom to express yourself, but your role here is to answer the questions that are put by counsel, not to involve in discussion or argument.  Okay?  And we will control you to the extent that you will answer the questions that are put and not continue to make additional speeches.  It's better for everybody including yourself, that you just answer the questions that are put to you.  Do you understand that? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understand, Mr. President.  But everything depends on the questions that are asked of me.  If the questions require me to give an explanation, I have to be professional in my approach. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This is exactly an example of what you are not supposed to do.  The question that you understood, the answer that you understood, what I said was a sufficient answer to my question and the additional speech you made was quite unnecessary. 
THE WITNESS:
Okay. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, is it true that on the 30th of May 2003 when you met with the investigators from the ICTR, you were given a copy of your statement from 2001, and you were asked if it was accurate, and in fact you confirmed that the statement was accurate, and you gave them some additional information none of which pertains to the fact that you had seen Mr. Ngirumpatse after your injury at the ministry of justice.  Is that correct? 
A.	The truth of the matter is that after I was hurt, I went to see Mr. Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	Yes, and you told the investigators in 2001 that you went to see him at the Kabuga building, but somehow they wrote down the ministry of justice; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And then in 2003 when you read what they wrote down and you had the opportunity to correct it, you didn't correct it; is that correct? 
A.	When they asked me those questions, I remember it was in the evening.  They were in a hurry it seems.  And so I didn't have an opportunity to reread the entire statement.  I thought that the statement was correct, and that the truth was reflected in the statement.  That is the reason, Counsel.  I trusted that they had correctly written down what I said.   
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, with the assistance of the registry, I would like the witness to be shown a document which is entitled, "Note, investigators' notes concerning a meeting at the contact of May 2003, the French document is K0348852, which is what I am going to show to the witness, and the English is K0354383 and these are contained in the disclosures of the witness's statement that were made by the Prosecution witness on electronic form to the Trial Chamber.   
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, we placed in front of you the notes of the investigators after they had an interview with you at the Miles Coline hotel, on the 30th of May 2003.  And if you look at the first paragraph, it says that the witness himself reread his statement taken by the ICTR investigators on 
	11th January 2001 and confirmed the entire contents, and then there are seven additional paragraphs of additional information which the investigator say, that you provided on that occasion.  So, it's true, is it not that on this occasion you had the opportunity to reread the entire statement of 11th January 2001.  And you did so and you said that it was all correct including the fact about the ministry of justice? 
A.	You are saying that the mention of the ministry of justice is correct.  I don't see that unless we set aside those notes, but I don't understand.  I don't see any mention made of the ministry of justice.  I don't see any link between this document and the ministry of justice.   Let's talk about this document that we have before us.  Maybe then we can deal with the issue of the ministry of justice, I am not sure I understand. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I think you should wait for the next question and then answer that, if you can. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, isn't it true that on the 30th of May, 2003, when you were presented with your statement of January of 2001, you confirmed its entire contents, and you made no mention of any error concerning the fact that you had seen Mr. Ngirumpatse at the ministry of justice on the day that you were assaulted in May 1992? 
A.	That's correct.  But let me tell you one sentence was left out.  The MRND office was in Muhima at that time.  At the time as it turns out, the minister of justice was Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The witness is correcting the interpreter saying that he was the minister of justice at the time. 
THE WITNESS:
That is why I am telling you that they left out a sentence or part of a sentence.  I went to the MRND office but at the time he was the minister of justice.  That is the reality of the situation, Mr. Robinson. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, Mathieu Ngirumpatse was not the minister of justice in May 1992.  Okay?  And my point to you, though to you, is when you read the statement or that you went to the ministry of justice on that day, in May 1992, you didn't make any correction of that; isn't that right, it's very simple? 
A.	What I am saying is that during the time he wasn't minister of justice, I agree with you he wasn't minister of justice in May.  However, in April, when the MRND congress was held, he left the ministry of justice before the congress was held.  Now, with regard to statements, this is what the investigators said when they mentioned the ministry of justice and when he took that ministry over I know very well about that.    He was one of my friends.  He offered me a job and he helped me.  That's the truth I am not lying.  I can tell that you are trying to cross-examine the witness and always fairly, but what I am telling you is the statement that I made at that time and you look at it, you should look at the one before it.  That's my answer, Counsel. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I think you are talking too much.  It would better for the progress of the trial, for you, for everybody, if you answered the question that you are asked and then stop speaking.  Okay.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
My Lord, if I can just offer a brief comment.  I understand the court's frustration, and with the slow pace of this line of questioning, but could I raise the issue, this was the point that was raised thoroughly in cross-examination by Mr. Robinson.  Mr. Robinson addressed this point.  Substantively, a few minutes ago, and we are still huffing on the same issue, and the witnesses have responded to the question.  So, I think things would move a lot faster if Mr. Robinson would move on in his questioning because the witness has answered the question, and we are stuck with this issue because Mr. Robinson wants a very specific answer when the point has been made.  So, I am not trying to contradict the Court I am simply requesting that if more control was exercised with the cross-examination, the witness would speed along as well.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please continue.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I think the best thing I should do right now is to ask that the witness statement of the 30th of May 2003, be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ41A, and the English version which I have now, I give to the registry to be admitted as D. NZ 41B, and then I will move on. 
(Exhibit D. NZ41A and D.NZ41B admitted) 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I would like to express some concern on this point.  As a matter of principle, there is nothing in that statement that the Prosecutor is afraid of having come into evidence, but we are going to end up with a situation where the record is simply flooded up with documentary material that is not necessary.  To begin with, well, this is not a statement cover of the witness.  The witness did not sign this investigator's note.  We have not even established the witness has ever seen this investigator's note prior to ten minutes ago.  He was asked about the contradiction, he admitted the contradiction.  What is the basis of introducing this investigators note at this point?  I will rely on the Court's discretion on this matter, go down the path. Where the work is going to be flooded with material that is absolutely unnecessary to establish the point, but we are going to see what the accused is trying to make here.  What is to be gained by admitting this?  It's not harmful to the Prosecution.  The witness has already admitted the point that the witness - - Mr. Robinson is trying to make, and there is other information on it which is actually helpful to the Prosecution.  So, I am not trying to shape the evidence, I am raising an issue of procedure. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, I am sorry - I really didn't want to get to Mr. Robinson; I think you are the one I should apologise.  I wanted to address Mr. Webster.  Was the investigator's note signed by - - anybody?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
No, Your Honour.  This was, if you recall, there was a long debate about what qualifies a document as a witness statement.  I will bring it within the confines of Rule 66, and we referred to the need to get the Appeals Chamber's decision.  In fact, there was an internal or a memo that was sent to CMS and to the parties and Trial Chamber under this very issue and it had to do with the disclosure.  And we made a decision, a policy decision in our office to disclose all investigators' notes if they fell within the definition of a statement under Niyitegeka Appeals Chamber decision.  So, we made a decision at that time under a flood of information that was then disclosed, not only to the defence in this case, but to the Defence in other cases.  For we had never considered the witness statements.  This document was never shown to the witness.  So, this is something that is generated internally. We cannot even establish when this particular document was generated whether it was on the same day that investigators spoke to the witness or a week later or month later or months later. I myself have generated investigators' notes internal memoranda but I made two months after having spoken to someone.  But all of those materials were disclosed.   Because we were trying to make the most complete disclosure possible but not to take that internal memorandum, and characterise it as a witness statement and place it before the witness and try to introduce it in evidence, at this point as a prior inconsistent statement to me it is problematic.  Now, the practical matter of this particular memorandum is actually helpful to the Prosecution.  So I m not trying to keep something out of the record because I think it hurts the Prosecution's case.  I am raising this as a matter of procedure because with this first witness in our trial, we are setting the tone for the rest of the trial, and what I see happening down the line are innumerable documents being entered into the record when they shouldn't be.  So, I leave it to the court's discretion because it actually does not - - Prosecution at all.  What it does is send signal to the Defence that all of these internal memoranda should be entered into the record - as prior and inconstant statements. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson the issue which I think the jurisdiction is trying to protect is the fact that the Prosecutor is obliged to give notice of the testimony that the witness is going to give.  Now, if the Prosecution takes interviews of witnesses, it's their obligation under the rules to disclose it.  And the Prosecutor has chosen this method of disclosure and yet you are saying that this method of disclosure is not proper because the Prosecutor did not say that or did not show it to the witness.  I am at a loss to understand how the obligation to disclose which has been discharged by the production of it afterwards is still a document which you say is not a matter which the Court should see when it is considering recording it with the witness because the purpose of these documents is to test whether the witness has made prior inconsistence statements to support witness's credibility.  I do not really understand how this could be a record of only an interview, the only interview, and yet the Prosecutor has one document which says it's not admissible for the purpose of credibility assessment... 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Actually, if it would assist matters, Your Honour, what I could do is withdraw my objection and consent to the document going into evidence and share with the Court this internal memo that was not an internal memo but a memorandum that was sent to the parties for distributions that concerns this issue and we can come back to it after the break or at a little time that the Court can give us some guidance and on how we can proceed in the future. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Does it have a sender's signature? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
This is something from our Prosecution team the documents what we decided to disclose investigators' notes as part of our Rule 66 disclosure, and in spite of the fact that they were not signed by the witnesses, so, it just gives the Court an additional background to look at the issue, and this is not an issue that I raised to hold the proceedings up.  I am simply just trying -- you know, I would hope that we get some guidance through the testimony of this witness so that we don't confront the same issue repeated with other witnesses.  If I could ask the Registry assistant to show this to Mr. Robinson.  it's something that he has already received, and the Court can consider it - in light of my comments.
JUDGE SHORT: 
Mr. Webster, is it your practice that the investigators don't sign the investigators notes? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
The practice in the office was that, investigator's notes were internal memoranda that were covered by Rule 70, they were work product and they were never to be disclosed.  They were internal memoranda and as the jurisprudence developed, and particularly with Niyitegeka, the 
Appeals Chamber's decision on the issue of disclosure; we made a decision to disclose everything. We have gone in the direction of making everything available to the parties, including the electronic disclosures strips, we put all our public documents there, we were putting witness statements in there, and we were putting investigators notes there.  So our position has shifted over time with the development of the jurisprudence.  And, now, everything is literally placed at the disposal of the Defence.  But having done that, it doesn't mean that it's appropriate to take an internal memorandum, characterise it as a witness statement, show it to the witness, tell him to agree with it or disagree with it and enter it into evidence. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, when you say your position has changed, do you mean that your position has changed in order to comply with the jurisprudence?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
No, Your Honour.  Our position has changed to provide the greatest possible disclosure because even -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You are saying that the jurisprudence is not required to disclose the record of questions and answers put to a witness? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Questions and answers, yes, because that is -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That is what this document is. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
	No, it's not because there are no question on that document.  And that is precisely the issue that -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, in fact, you see that means also if you say that a document which you called an interview of witness is not a record of the questions and answers that are put were put down.  What is it? It's an entitled interview? 
MR. WEBSTER:  
No, Your Honour, it's, an entitled - note indicative
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, because it's notes of an interview of a witness. 
(Pages 1 to 14 by Petrus Chijarira)











1115H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So this describes an interview. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, this is the interpreter, the English interpreter.  It is difficult for the French booth to interpret properly when the exchange or should we say the discussion between counsel and the President are going on at fast pace.  If a gap were observed, it would enable the French interpreters to do their job properly.  Thank you, sir.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for the reminder.  You see, I thought the jurisprudence on this was already clarified.  I didn't realise that there was a dispute about it. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
In an attempt to avoid any dispute on the issue of what should be disclosed, we disclosed expansively.  So, something that I would read and not consider to be a witness statement is simply disclosed to the Defence because it is a recorded interview -- a recorded -- a statement that was generated by an investigator.  So, we don't hold back internal memorandum, that document information from a witness, anymore; all of that stuff is disclosed.   The question I have is not -- is not with the jurisprudence itself; it is the propriety of now taking this internal memorandum that the witness has never seen and confronting him with it as a prior inconsistent fact.  Now, this witness has acknowledged that either he made a mistake or the investigators made a mistake.  And on the record, in his recorded testimony, he has acknowledged the inconsistency.  If he has acknowledged the inconsistency in his testimony, what is to be gained by now admitting this writing into evidence? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It enables us to see, when we review the evidence, what the inconsistency is.  
MR. WEBSTER:
	Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
	And if --
MR. WEBSTER:
	Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
     It provides information on the consistency; that is its purpose. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't see it as having a greater or lesser value than that. 

MR. WEBSTER: 
All right.  Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, so we have decided to admit the document.  

Yes, Mr. Registrar -- yes, Mr. Witness, you can speak. 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, it would seem to me that I am being prohibited from providing details on a number of issues.  What I want to say is that this document had been given to me, it was withdrawn.  I had provided explanations because there is information in that document showing that Mathieu and Karemera financed the genocide.  I corrected that point.  And I would like everything to be clarified.  If we look at the first paragraph, and all of the contents of the document -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness -- 
THE WITNESS:
Then we must note that I have provided further explanations, and take into account what I have just said, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think you have said that several times this morning and we understand you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And just to clarify matters for the court, Your Honour, so that the record is complete and, perhaps, this will allay some of the witness's concerns; there is another document that we served, it is called a will-say of the 16th of September of 2005.  And if we look at page 2 on that will-say statement, there is a paragraph D.  And that paragraph is entitled, "Remarks -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You don't have to read it. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
No, I'm not reading the contents, I'm reading the caption: "Remarks concerning the document, L002-8057 of the 30th of May, 2005."  And it lists six corrections. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. -- you don't have to give us the contents.

We have decided to take the short break, as well. 
(Court recessed from 1130H to 1201H)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we -- without giving any comment on how you should conduct your cross-examination, we thought we should let you know that if your cross-examination was concluded before we were in a position to deal with the matter we addressed this morning, that we would want you to be assured that you would have an opportunity for further cross-examination, so it is not necessary for you to protract your cross-examination to assure that --  
MR. ROBINSON:
I appreciate that.  And I assure you that I wasn't doing that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, we weren't accusing you of doing that; but I thought it was better to put it on the record. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, I know.  I am not going to delay for that reason. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you may continue. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, not only you were given the opportunity in May of 2003 to correct your statement, but it is true, is it not, that again on the 18th of February 2004, you met with investigators of the ICTR at the Salt and Pepper restaurant, and were once again shown your statement of 2001 and giving an opportunity to make corrections? 
A.	That is a relevant question, Counsel, but I thought I already answered that one.  Perhaps I can address the President.  Earlier when I answered a question I was told that I was too lengthy in my responses, and now you are asking a question that I have already answered, so if the Court wishes, I will answer it again. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sir --  
THE WITNESS:
I think the President reminded me on several occasions to be brief in my answers. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If the answer has already been answered, that should assist a more concise response at this time. 
THE WITNESS:
As I said before, I said that I trusted the OTP investigators.  I said that I trusted this Tribunal.  So, I added that you should take into account what I am saying during my testimony; otherwise, you are drawing out these proceedings.  I understand that that is your work, but perhaps you should take into account the explanations that I give in response to questions.  

It is true; I confirmed the content of the statement that I made.  However, after that was done some mistakes were made.  Those mistakes were corrected when I arrived here.  I am a human being, Counsel, I can be mistaken sometime, perhaps, with regard to a word or phrase.  But with regard to the mistakes that were pointed out in this statement, and I am talking about the one in 2003 and 2004, if I confirm the content of the statement, it is because I wasn't -- I didn't have, rather, an opportunity to point out the mistakes.  But I can explain where I was at different times, and I explained to you how the mistakes were made, that is true.  It is true, many mistakes were made.  And we should add that I trusted the people who were working for the Office of the Prosecutor.

So, if this happened, and now I am before the Chamber, and if I speak about events that I experienced, you should consider that.  Sure, there are some things in the statements that lead to misunderstandings that are mistakes.  You talked about how some colleagues did the same thing, and I agree with you, there are mistakes.  And if they were made, it is because those in the Office of the Prosecutor are responsible.  

Simply take into account what I am telling you, if you want to rely on something else; if you want to rely on this document more than you want to rely on me, that is fine.  I'm speaking about the statement in 2003.  There was an issue of whether Ngirumpatse and Karemera funneled money to the RTLM.  And you asked me whether or not I confirmed the statement of 2004.  My answer will be the same, it was the same, and you keep coming back to it.  I told you about the circumstances, about how I was injured to the head, and I told you how I went to Mathieu for assistance.  And, in fact, he was not the one who helped me; it was someone from the PL Party who did, on the contrary.  If you know something about your client, Mr. Nzirorera, or if I know something, I will tell you.  But I'm not in a position to tell you about something that I don't know about.  

He doesn't even know me, perhaps he can tell you, I have no doubt about that.  He doesn't know me, Mathieu, he is there, and he does.  Maybe I was too young at the time, and since I was young, I was not a big man.  And perhaps today I have changed in appearance, even they have changed with regard to their physical characteristics, but I know very well that Mathieu knows me.  That is what I want to tell you; I never lie, Counsel Robinson. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, don't you think that the issue of the inconsistency has been addressed to the extent that it will enable us to address it. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, what I am hoping to do is to show that he was given this statement in 2003, he read the contents and he said there was --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we understood that -- 
MR. ROBINSON: 
And then again --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We understood that.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have seen the material and we have heard what you have said. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
And then again in 2004, the same, I want to establish that it is -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sure it is --  
MR. ROBINSON: 
That is what I was trying to do.  I moved to 2004, but I believe he is still talking about the 2003 statement. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can put that in. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
But maybe if the registrar could show him another document, this is dated 18th February 2004.  It is the subject, "Interview of Ahmed Mbonyunkiza, by the crime analyst of the OTP." And it has KO357088, is the French, and I'm -- there is an English translation at KO348826. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Where is the end of the document?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I believe it is just a two-page document. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, is that, in fact, correct?  There is no indication at the bottom that it is the end of the document. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm still trying to find the document because it was, if you give me a moment, please. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
We all have this electronically; this is part of the bundle -- of Witness G's -- I mean part of this witness's statement. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Would you mind if I had a look at the document that is actually being tendered, and that way I could -
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, are we waiting for Mr. Webster?
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry, I was just waiting, I wasn't sure exactly what for.  

Mr. Webster, did you have a chance to verify the document?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, the document consists of two pages.  It is unsigned.  I haven't seen that among my files, but clearly it is a document from the OTP.  I have the English translation in front of me but I have no doubt about its authenticity.  As for its admissibility, I have the same concerns that I expressed previously but the Chamber has already dealt with them. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Thank you. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would move that this document be admitted, the French version that the witness             has --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but you haven't asked the witness anything yet. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I was hoping to make a shortcut here. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I know, but part of the problem is that Mr. Robinson has -- Mr. -- oh dear -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
You've changed my name. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster acknowledges authenticity, but I still think the issue has to do with his credibility; so I think we need his answer on it. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, isn't it true that on the 18th of February 2004 at the Salt and Paper restaurant in Kigali, you were once again giving your statement of 11 January 2001 to read; and you confirmed its full content, and you made no correction to the report that you had gone to see Mathieu Ngirumpatse at the ministry of justice, after you were assaulted in May 1992? 
A.	Mr. Robinson, you are talking about a statement made in 2004.  Look at the second paragraph where it says that I confirmed the content of the statement made on 11 January 2001.  You will see that there is no mention of the phrase he read -- the witness, or deponent read the statement.  You should look at that statement.  In the phrase where you have the date of 11 January 2001, nowhere does it say that I read the document.  That shows that I trusted those who were working for the Office of the Prosecutor; and I thought that they correctly took down what I had said.  There is only one word you keep coming back to, the fact that I went to Kacyiru.  It is only one word, and you keep coming back to it.  I don't see any contradiction concerning this statement of 2003.  

As I said before, there is no mention to the effect that the witness or deponent read the statement; in which case you could have told me that I read and confirmed the content of the statement.  That said, when I appeared before this Chamber, I was first shown the different statements that I had made.  There was one of them in which I saw several different things; and I think that is the statement that you mentioned earlier, I'm talking about the statement of 2003.

Look at the different corrections made to that statement.  And I'm sure you understood under which circumstances the corrections were made.  Now, with regard to the word in question here, it didn't get away from me.  And at any rate -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the Kinyarwanda booth is raising an issue.  What is happening is that the witness is listening to the French interpretation as he is talking, and intervening and making comments on the interpretation?   
THE WITNESS:
It is because the interpretation is contrary to what I am actually saying, that is why I am tuning to the French channel.  I think Mr. Robinson raised this during the last hearing.  I'm given explanations, and sometimes they lead to confusion, the same goes for interpretation.  Now, they are asking me to stop but you won't understand.  He is not aware of the technical aspects of this.

Excuse me, Mr. Interpreter, but I will proceed now, Mr. President, pardon me.  I am not trying to make the Chamber's life difficult here.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. and Mrs. Interpreters, we think that it is the witness's testimony and he has the right to comment on the translation if he wishes.  If there is a problem, it should be drawn to our attention and we will deal with it.

You may continue.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I want to go back to your statement that you didn't have a chance to read the January statement when you met with the investigators at the Salt and Pepper restaurant on the 18th of February 2004.  And I'm going to read to you the second paragraph of that document that is in front of you, and maybe this is a translation problem, but for what the English says is this, it says, "First the witness was given to read his statement, K0056296, dated 11 January 2001.  And he confirmed its full content."
Now, did you read the statement of 2001 when you met with the investigators on the                         18th of January 2004 at the Salt and Pepper restaurant? 
A.	I didn't read it as such.  I was shown the document, and they said, "Do you recognise it?  Do you agree with its contents?"  I said, "Yes" because it was my own statement.  Nevertheless, I did not have an opportunity to read the statement, to make any possible corrections if I had to.  But, yes, I confirm that it was my document. 
Q.	But then in the document that is in front of you, there were 16 additional paragraphs in which you spoke of items contained within your statement of January 2001, and you elaborated and provided precision about your statement.  And it is your testimony then that you did that without referring to the statement of January 2001?
A.	That is correct.  I added some clarifications, and furthermore, no one asked me any questions about those clarifications; the Office of the Prosecutor did not nor did the Defence, no one asked me questions about that.  Only when you elaborate on an answer, I can do that, but the President has asked me to be more brief.  Some things were said, and they were said with regard to the events that took place at the time and with the reigning situation at the time.  So if I continue to provide information, we will get back to the different events and it would take us at least two months to go over it.  Every paragraph will require me to give lengthy explanations.  That is why I would like to ask Mr. Robinson to ask me questions about each paragraph; I am prepared to answer you about the various paragraphs.  We lived through these things, Mr. Robinson.  We are not inventing anything here. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So can we agree that on the occasion of the 18th of February 2004 you made no mention to the    Office of the Prosecutor that the information that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was at the minister of justice when you went to him in early May was incorrect? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry, I am going to lengthen the proceedings by objecting, but this is exactly what I was referring to earlier, Your Honour.  The Court has already instructed -- or has made the observation that the issue of inconsistency had been addressed extensively; and here we are still stuck on the same issue.  Look at the length of these statements and look at the length and breath of this witness's testimony, and we are focusing on whether the witness went to the minister of justice instead of to the Kabuga building to have a conversation.  Is that really what we need to focus on in this trial?  Look at everything that has been said in this witness's direct examination and in every other cross examination.  How much time do we need to establish where a particular conversation took place?  We are not even talking about the substance of the conversation.  This has gone on for over an hour.  

So, I'm objecting to the form of the question.  The question has been asked and answered multiple times.   
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, Mr. Robinson we agree with Mr. Webster but from a different point of view.  You see the witness's position is clear.  We understand what -- and it is a matter for us to evaluate it.  I think -- I don't know if you are going to get any additional information from further questions.  I think that the matter has been thoroughly, thoroughly explored, and it is up to us to decide how we review his answers. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Very well, Mr. President.  I would like to offer this document as Exhibit D. NZ42A being French, and 42B being the English. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ42A, D. NZ42B admitted) 
MR. WEBSTER:
If I could just look at both documents again, because there is a question about the translation.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson -- I don't -- things are not your fault, things are not going very smoothly this morning.  How much more time do you think -- 
MR. ROBINSON: 
That is a difficult question, I thought that I would finish today, but I'm not sure I will finish today.  It is possible that I may finish today, but at this rate it is going to be difficult. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, you know, since we are not on video link, we'll revert to the schedule where we break for -- this might be an appropriate time, at 12:30 and resume at 2 o'clock; this may be an appropriate time to break now.  We will take our luncheon break now.  
(Court recessed from 12:30H to 1414H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.

Mr. Witness, before we resume this afternoon, a problem had developed this morning where the issue of your speaking directly to the interpreters about your perception that there were problems with the accuracy of their translation; what we would like to direct is that any such comments you make to the Bench, that you are not to speak directly to the interpreters on these matters.  If you have a problem with the quality or accuracy of the interpretation, you draw it to the attention of the Bench, and we will see that it is promptly addressed; do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have understood Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Yes, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President, over the lunch hour I received an e-mail which contained the order for submissions that the Trial Chamber had made with respect to the registry and this witness's passport.  And I would like to make an application that that order be amended or supplemented to request that the victim witness section provides copies of all correspondence from this witness.  He testified earlier today that since June he has been writing letters to the witness victim section about the issue that had been alluded to but not explained.  And I think that it would facilitate everyone's work if the Trial Chamber were to get all of the relevant material before it, and then we would not be delayed in having additional materials produced. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take that into consideration. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you very much, Mr. President.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, my understanding of the Court's order was that those materials would be brought to the attention of the Trial Chamber alone; and that the Trial Chamber would first make an independent determination whether they were relevant to the trial or not.  So, assuming that Mr. Robinson is referring to that portion of the order as well, I bring those concerns to the attention of the Court.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take that into consideration as well.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Mbonyunkiza? 
A.	Good afternoon, Mr. Robinson.  Before you proceed, there is something that you raised a moment ago.  You say that you have received an e-mail, but you didn't explain anything about it.  What I would like to say --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay -- go ahead --  
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, this matter is in the capable hands of the Bench, so you just proceed with your testimony. 
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Your Honour.  My problem is that this is a matter that deals with me.  It is outside of the issues that we were dealing with here.  It is a matter concerning my own person; it is a personal matter, Your Honour.  I wouldn't wish you to have the impression that I want to complicate this Chamber's task.  These are personal issues.  I wouldn't want Mr. Robinson to raise this issue which is of direct concern to me.  And this is why I had requested to meet the President of the Tribunal personally.  These are serious matters which could even affect my life.  You are trying to brush the matter aside, and sometimes you speak about it in veiled terms.  I don't know, it is an unhealthy situation, and I told you that I was going to speak about this matter at the end of my testimony.  This is what I wanted to underscore and reiterate to the Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, counsel was not speaking to you, he was speaking to the Bench.  Very often when counsel raises a legal matter, we ask the witness to take off the headphone.  You were not really involved in the question he asked.  It was a legal question relating to a judicial order that we had made.  So you made a legal submission which we will consider, and we will give a judicial ruling on it.  It is not a matter which really involved you.  Do you understand?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have understood, Mr. President.  If that is of no concern to me, then I have no objection. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, we have talked this morning about the report of 2001 in which it was stated that you had gone to the ministry of justice to seek assistance from Mathieu Ngirumpatse in May of 1992.  And I have shown you your statement for 2003 and 2004, when you were interviewed by the Office of the Prosecutor.  And I have pointed out that you did not correct that portion of the statement on those two occasions.

Now, you came to Arusha here in September of 2005, and you once again met the Prosecutor, and he once again showed you that statement of January 2001; correct?  
A.	I believe, Mr. Robinson is asking questions which are intended to delay the proceedings.  Let me address myself to the presiding Judge, this was the instruction given to me.  What I'm saying is the following.  I think I have explained this at length.  If he has other questions to put to me, I would rather ask him to put those questions to me.  I'm speaking now to the presiding Judge, I'm not speaking to counsel.  Since it is the presiding Judge who is under the control of the proceedings, he will indicate to me what conduct to adopt because we don't -- we don't want to go back into the details that we have already provided. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You should have noticed that that is the subject matter which the Bench is interested in.  It is our duty to monitor this, so we are doing it.  Once we think a line has been crossed, we will do something about it.  Now, although this subject matter has been addressed, quite substantially, we think you can answer that question.  And there is a short answer that you can give to that question.  It will save a lot of time if you do that.  
THE WITNESS:
Regarding that statement of 11th January 2001, it is true that that document was shown to me.  However, the statement on which we dwelt on regarding amendments to be made is the statement of 30th May 2003.  That is the statement which had several mistakes in it.  And that was the statement on which you based yourself previously in the questions that you put to me.  I think that is the answer I would give to you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, isn't it true that when you were interviewed in September 2005 here in Arusha by the Office of the Prosecutor, they showed you your statement of 11 January 2001, and you told them that the content is exact, but there were some precisions necessary to make.  And you, thereafter, gave them precisions about that statement.  And in doing so, you made no mention whatsoever that the statement going to the ministry of justice was incorrect? 
A.	That is a good question.  It is good for you to put that question to me.  You stated that when I came to Arusha, I was interviewed by officers of the Office of the Prosecutor.  However, there is no statement which has been signed by me.  That is what I want to mention.  Now, regarding that detail about the ministry, I am here, present here, physically, you can see me; I can provide you with any explanations you may require.  I told you that there was a mistake.  There were even other mistakes.  And it was the same mistake on which you are basing your questioning.  

Let me say this to you, I was a victim; I was beaten to the head, and I went to look for assistance from Mathieu in his office at the MRND, and not the offices of the ministry of justice.  You are coming back incessantly to this question, but I'm not going to change my statement.  I, indeed, said that if there had been a mistake when the statement was initially taken, I should have been challenged with the fact that there was no correction made by me.  In that instance, I would understand you.  What I have said before the Chamber is that there were mistakes in that statement.  I believe there was a document that the Prosecutor had wanted to tender before the Chamber, and the Chamber had said that he should not do that.  Maybe it is because the presiding Judge was aware of this matter, but I don't know anything about that.  I said that there were mistakes, but I think you should believe the explanations I'm making.  

I am here in front of you, and I experienced these events and I am telling you the truth.  I also believe that you are looking for the truth, unless I am wrong; but I'm also sure that you are looking for the truth about events that took place.  If that is the case, please refer to what I am saying in my testimony.  I believe that there is a Latin proverb which says that (Latin spoken), if I am not wrong.  But let me tell you, they made a mistake and this is what I have said.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness --  
THE WITNESS:
You had adopted that technique which stopped me from explaining to you further as best as I could. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the rules of our court permit a lawyer to put a question to you which suggests that on some occasion in the past you made a statement which was different to what you said in court.  Now, there is one particular issue counsel is addressing, and he is trying to put to you a number of occasions when that statement was contradicted.  Now, we have heard your speech, your explanation several times, but let's get on with the real questions.  And you can give a short answer to the questions and let us move on.  I think we've understood fully what the issue is now, and it doesn't need continued repetition. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I would like the registrar to show this witness a copy of the French version of his -- the will-say statement of September 2005.  I don't have an English version for this. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, what has been given to you is a document that was provided by the Prosecution after you met with them when you arrived here in Arusha.  And in this document, it reflects that they reviewed with you each of your statements; including the statement of January 2001.  And it reflects that you said, with respect to that January 2001 statement, that it was exact but some further precisions were required.  And then you went on to make a series of precisions about that statement.  And that is all right in front of you that you are looking at right now.  And I want you to agree with me, if it is true, that among the precisions you made was -- there was no mention, whatsoever, about correcting the portion of that statement in which you claim to have gone to the ministry of justice to see Mathieu Ngirumpatse after you were injured in May 1992; can you confirm that? 
A.	It is a good thing that you are showing me this document. I believe this is a document that the Prosecutor had wanted to show to the Defence.  Now, I have seen this document and it is being used officially in the discussions, in the proceedings.  I, indeed, spoke of the role of the RTLM in the genocide.  This document is an authentic one.  I, indeed, said that there were clarifications that I needed to provide; you yourself have said that.

I'm sorry I'm beginning to mix up my languages.  If those clarifications are in the document -- no, they are not in this document.  I am here, before the Chamber there was some clarifications that I provided whilst I was making this statement; and, subsequently, I am now present before the Chamber, I can give further clarifications if need be.  I, indeed, said that there were some clarifications that required to be made and that I would provide such clarification during my testimony.  
It is good for you to have notice to that term, "clarifications", clarifications.  I'm here now to provide clarifications on statements on which there may have been errors; even if the clarifications I may give today have not been mentioned in this document, I somewhat support the contents of the statement of 11th January 2001.  And I am providing clarifications, because I want to help in the manifestation of the truth regarding these events. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you remember what the question was?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What was it?  
THE WITNESS:
The question which was put to me is the following; the will-say statement was put before me, I was asked to admit that I recognised its contents.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. 
THE WITNESS:
It is, indeed, true. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If that was the question, couldn't you have answered it with one word?  
THE WITNESS:
No, I have to explain at length because he had mentioned the term "clarification", precisions.  I, therefore, would like us to have a complete document, which is placed before the Chamber.  He is the one who reminded me that the term precisions was to be found in this document.  So I must be grateful to him for that.  And maybe you should tell him that in my stead. 
(Pages 15 to 28 by Donna M. Lewis)















1430H 
MR. ROBINSON. 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I would like to offer Exhibit D.NZ43.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Admitted.
	(Exhibit No. D. NZ43 admitted) 
MR. WEBSTER: 
This was a document that was never placed in our evidence, and if he could just tell us how many pages it is, and maybe, we could find some way of -- what I would like to offer is that I would provide the Court with a clean copy.  This seems to have some writing from Mr. Robinson on it, and it's not a particularly good copy.  If we -- if you give me the opportunity of providing the Court with a clean copy tomorrow morning or later on this afternoon, I can do that, or Mr. Robinson has a clean copy. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would appreciate that he can provide a clean copy.  My copy has some numbers of the paragraphs so that I can keep track, but if there's a clean copy available, then that could be better. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. The offer is accepted.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, you want me to continue while your computers are being serviced. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyukiza, now let's forget about what you said before.  Let's just move on in a narrative, and I want you to go back and remember this day in May when you sought Mr. Ngirupatse's assistance.  So, you are now at the Kabuga building, you are bleeding.  Tell us what happened from that point on. 
A.	Pardon, me, Mr. Robinson, this is a month of fasting for me, and so it's difficult, sometimes when you are hungry, it is difficult to work in certain conditions and even remember sometimes, but I shall attempt to answer your question.  Please, bear that in mind when you put your questions to me.  

	Let me answer you briefly.  The date was the 7th of May.  That is the same day that Madam Agathe was assaulted unless I am mistaken.  After the demonstrations were organised to denounce the attack against 	Agathe Uwiliyingimana, who at the time was minister of primary and secondary education, later on, when she was killed during the genocide, she was prime minister at that time.  So, the demonstration was organised on the date that I mentioned. 

	Pardon me, Mr. President, but I have been asked a question that requires me to give a lengthy answer.  From time to time when I answer the questions, I can see that the Presiding Judge disapproves of the way I answer the question, but sometimes I am wondering if I am going beyond the limits.  But this particular question requires a lengthy answer and that is why I asked counsel to bear in mind that this is the month of fasting for me, and that I shall attempt to answer the question bit by bit.  So, please, 
	Mr. President, Your Honours, pardon me, for that. 
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I think it could be better if you start the narrative later.  We don't need to go back to what preceded.  I am asking you to tell us what happened in the office of the Kabuga building.  It's better not to go back to cover the grounds, what led up to that.  Just start when you were in the Kabuga building and tell us what happened.  That's the easiest. 
A.	You know, Mr. Robinson, they say there's no smoke without a fire.  You are asking me to tell you what happened at the Kabuga building, but how can I not mention the preceding events?  It would be impossible.  Let me try to answer in the way you want me to.  Here is the situation.  I was hurt and I went to see Mr. Ngirumpatse, seeking medical help or assistance with that.  He said, "We are not in a clinic; this is not the hospital."  He made no gesture to help me.  Why?  I think I explained why. This is someone I met on several occasions, even in his office when he was minister of justice, I can even describe the layout of his office.  He had a very large desk.  There was a carpet, but I don't remember which colour.  

	With regard to that MRND office, in the Kabuga building, he kicked me out when I wanted to speak to him.  Someone showed up who had a vehicle and there was a PL flag on the vehicle.  He could see that I was bleeding.  He took care of me and brought me to Nyabugogo where there was a small medical office.  I don't know who the woman, who treated me still lives in Kiyovu.
	I am not certain of that.  I remember the daughter of Sandahuwimana (phonetic) who was my classmate.  Today, she is in the United States of America.  I found out those details later on.  I was given some stitches in that medical office and then I went home.  Do you understand someone from the PL party seeing me in an MRND cap?

I ask you that the translator did a -- mistake now.  He says that I was keeping my hat of MRND, but it is not the truth.  I had putting in my pain here, when the blood was -- what can I say in English?  My English is not better but I am trying to explain to you, but she said that I was with my hat, the hat, but is not the truth. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I suggest that you repeat your sentence in Kinyarwanda. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I had the hat which I used to cover the wound.  I wasn't wearing the hat as you suggested.  I was covering the wound with it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, now that has been clarified, you can go on. 
THE WITNESS:
That's the situation, Mr. Robinson.  So, I was covering up the wound with my hat, and I went to seek treatment. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, now, when you went to see Mr. Ngirumpatse in the Kabugo building, what floor was his office on? 
A.	Thank you, for that question, Mr. Robinson.  If I would ask you on which floor the people who were killed at the World Trade Centre were on, would you be able to tell me?  There are some things you can't remember.  You can't remember things about unfortunate events.  What I can tell you is that it is difficult to remember certain things.  These events occurred in 1992, more than ten years ago.  I can't answer again by telling you that it was on such and such a floor, but I have forgotten.  What about the pressure I am under?  I am not in a position to invent anything.  I simply don't remember.  That's my answer. 
Q.	Okay, that's perfectly okay.  It's not a problem.  If you don't remember something, you can just say,
	"I don't remember" and I go on to my next question.  Don't feel bad about that.  Can you remember when you arrived in the MRND offices?  Did you go directly into Mr. Ngirumpatse's office or was there some secretary or receptionist or someone else, who you encountered before seeing Mr. Ngirumpatse? 
A.	I am telling you the truth.  Given how powerful that person was, I don't know if I am describing the situation accurately.  I was bleeding, the secretary opened the door, I went immediately inside.  I couldn't wait.  That was the situation, Mr. Robinson. 
Q.	And tell us please, what did you say to Mr. Ngirumpatse and what he said to you? 
A.	Does that mean that you didn't understand what I said?  I thought that I gave you an explanation.  I want to point out, earlier I said there was no hesitation in my answer.  And I don't hesitate when I answer questions.  

Mr. President, I gave these explanations because sometimes verbs are used in the interpretation towards French from Kinyarwanda.  And in the meantime, in that exercise the meaning of what I am saying is lost somewhere.  When someone says, "I think", they could lead to confusion.  This is a witness who is sure, who is giving specific information.  So the verb, "I think", creates some doubt before this Chamber.  I simply wanted to point that out, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, then the record has noted that. 
THE WITNESS:
Maybe, we can move forward with Mr. Robinson. 

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Yes, can you tell me, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, what you said to Mathieu Ngirumpatse and what he said to you? 
A.	I showed him the injury I had incurred during the demonstration which was organised in front of the Vedasta Rubagura's building.  I told him that he should give me some money so I could go and get treatment because at that time I did not have a job.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse told me to get out of his office and that was his answer.  Let me remind you, just a few days before that I had resigned as the deputy administrator of credits at the ministry of justice.  Do you understand now?  And let me remind you, Mathieu Ngirumpatse was the minister in that ministry.  Prior to that, we had met one another, prior to him forming that genocidal group.  And given all of that, I must say that's why in answer he kicked me out of his office.  And so I did leave.  These were the important things that were said to my mind.  I don't know if we should continue for me to give more explanations, but that's what I have to say right up to you. 
Q.	Was anything else discussed between you and Mathieu Ngirumpatse in his office as you were standing there bleeding, besides your asking for money to help with your medical situation? 
A.	I had nothing more to discuss with him at that time.  Did you think I was going to sit down with him and talk about the MRND programme?  I had just been wounded. 
Q.	I agree with you completely so that's why I want you now to look at your statement of January 11th, which is Exhibit D. NG3A, and if you could be shown that by the registry? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. Fry, this is Exhibit D. NG, an exhibit for Mr. Ngirumpatse. 
MR. FRY: 
In French. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, if you could show him the French.  And Mr. President, if you are following in English, this will be - if you are following the English, I am going to direct your attention to page 7, the last paragraph of this statement.  
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
And Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I want to direct your attention to page 6 of the French version of your interview in January 2001, and I am going to read to you what you said on that occasion.  It says, "I was attacked and wounded by one of the demonstrators in front of the MRND office in Kigali.  I went to see Ngirumpatse in his office at the ministry of justice, to show him my injury and urge him to do something to stop people from confusing our movement, the JMRND, with the newly formed militia group.  I tried to explain to him that the JMRND could exist without being confused with other -- with the newly formed militia group, with each one having a specific role to play.  Youths wanting to join the militia group could do so of their own free will.  He became irritated and chased me out of his office."  

Now, you have just us told that you had no other discussion with him except your injury, but you told the Prosecutor in 2001 that you had this discussion with him about the JMRND.  So tell us which is the truth. 
A.	It's a good thing that you pointed out that passage.  God bless you for that.  Look closely at the document.  You asked me a question when I didn't have the document, but now I have it.  We are now talking about how I was injured.  During that demonstration I was attacked in front of the regional office in Kigali by the demonstrators.  Do you see?  I have just read the passage.  I went to see Ngirumpatse, in his office at the ministry of justice to show him my injury and urge him to do something to stop people.  With regard to that passage, I explained this to the investigator, they wrote down what I said.  They have mixed everything up.  It's clear here.  With regard to my meeting with Ngirumpatse.  I was still at the ministry of justice when I told him that they should not mix or confuse the movement of the JMRD with the party.  I was still at the ministry of justice when the conversation took place.

Now, when I went for help, for treatment that happened at a different place, but the investigator did not take the time to find out the detail.  He didn't ask me even those questions; instead, he makes the events up.  In other words, he mixed up the meeting I had with Ngirumpatse and the time I went to see him when I was injured.  He has mixed.  He has put it all in one bowl.  It is true; I met with Mathieu prior to that.  I told you that I was chairman of the JMRND and that I was also a member of the MRND committee in Nyarugege commune.  Even before I worked in that office, I had a lot of meetings with him.  You can see in this paragraph that everything has been mixed up.  There's a sentence that ends with a period and then a new sentence begins.  And here I am explaining a great many things.  Do you think, Mr. Robinson that someone who was wounded very much so, could have the luxury of talking about these other things?  I was looking for medical treatment, and you are going to start talking about other things as mentioned here in this passage?  It's a great thing that you showed me this document, now that I have it in front of me.  That is why I am telling you that what I am saying in my testimony is true.  I am clarifying the events for you.  I spoke about the meetings I had with Mathieu.  I also spoke about how I was injured at one point in time, but the investigator here has mixed everything up.  That's the problem.  That's the explanation that I can give you.  This is all quite logical. 
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, you keep blaming the investigators and the interpreters but you had three occasions to review the statement, 2003, 2004, 2005, and you never, once made any correction to this paragraph which you now say is very mixed up.  So can you tell us why you, not other people, but you, failed to make this collection when you had the opportunity? 
A.	What I am telling you, Mr. Robinson, and please understand me, is that; I am realising that you are seeking to confuse the issue instead of looking at the truth of the matter.  The reason I say this, is because I am here before you.  I am talking about events that I witnessed and I am telling you the truth about them.  I am trying to demonstrate that the person who took down the statement did so, and there is truth in the statement, but what I am telling you is that he mixed up the events; that's what 
I am telling you.  Otherwise, the facts contained therein are true.  This is the type of clarification I am trying to provide about this document that we are discussing, be it before the Prosecution or before the Chamber.  I clearly said that I was going to provide clarification.  You can even see that in the document you gave to me.  

Now, since the investigator took down the statement at the time I was in prison, there are genuine events that are written down, but they are mixed up.  But it doesn't remove any of the truthfulness, if you will, from what he said here.  Yes, I did meet with Ngirumpatse at one point in time but we have to locate when, exactly I met with him and what happened at that specific point in time.  You were asking me if the facts described in this document are not true.  I am telling you, yes, they are but things are mixed up in the document.  

Now, with regard to the corrected version of 2003, I gave that statement when I was a free man.  I was no longer in detention.  And later on, when I came here, I provided further clarification.  At the time, I believe that everything I said was correctly taken down.  But later on, I realised that was not the case.  All of these events did take place at one time or another.  That is what I wanted to tell you, 
	Mr. Robinson.  That is the truth.  So, please remember the clarifications I am providing with regard to these different events.  I had a meeting at the ministry of justice and what happened during that meeting is written down here, but at another point in time I was injured.  That's what I told you right here in front of the Chamber.  But the investigator went taking down the statement, but was not focused on the individual who had been injured.  He was rather more concerned with Mathieu Ngirumpatse that is what is more problematic here.  Have you understood me, Mr. Robinson?  The President prevented me from providing further clarification; otherwise, there would have been something else I would have wanted to say.  That's why I am deciding to stop here.  I am going to stop here. 
Q.	So, before you were injured, is it true then that while you were employed at the ministry of justice 
Mathieu Ngirumpatse, had thrown you out of his office when you attempted to discuss the JMRND? 
A.	That's what I am telling you, Counsel. 
Q.	Okay, so in February of 1992, you heard Mathieu Ngirumpatse say he wanted to exterminate Tutsis.  In April, 1992 you had him throw you out of his office when you discussed the JMRND.  And then in
	May 1992, when you were injured and bleeding, you went to the office of the same man, 
	Mathieu Ngirumpatse for help, is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is true.  The Presiding Judge prevented me from going into details and I will abide by the Chamber's instructions, otherwise there's a lot of information I could have provided, but I would rather stop here until the Chamber states otherwise. 
Q.	Okay, and now after Mathieu Ngirumpatse had refused to give you medical -- money for medical assistance, later in the month of May, you got a job at Petrorwanda.  Correct? 
A.	Yes, that's true.  And I told you that, first of all, I had to sit an exam or go through an interview before I obtained that employment. 
Q.	And on the fourth day of your new job, you requested to take a day off so that you could attend a demonstration of the MRND, correct? 
A.	Yes, that is true.  I am going to repeat the event to you.  Given the circumstances of the time, given the power and the weight of the MRND, one wouldn't have been able to be absent without asking for permission to be excused.  And then Murenzi was no longer a member of the MRND.  I am giving you further explanation.  I think I am falling into the same trap and I have already mentioned this on another occasion. 
Q.	And on that day, the 28th of May 1992, you marched along with the other MRND militants.  Correct? 
A.	That is correct.  I told you that, before I made that decision, I had to be careful.  I could not come to that decision precipitously.  To go back a little -- no, I am not going to do that because the Presiding Judge said that we would touch on that matter on another occasion.  You must listen to me, I did tell you that I attended that demonstration and I am taking God as my witness.  I am telling you the truth.  I cannot lie, Mr. Robinson. 
Q.	And when you look at the communiqué from the MRND after that demonstration, you said that it was false and that, in fact, it was the Interahamwe who had attacked members of the PL and other parties during that demonstration is that correct? 
A.	You are quite right.  I can even produce evidence for you.  There's a document that was drafted by one of the MRND leaders who also signed the MRND statutes.  The person in question was the conseiller of Kimisangara and he represented the Interahamwe there, in Kimisangara and on that date of 
	the 28th May, people were beaten up and were wounded.  If I am not mistaken, you can go and consult the documents that are in the offices.  The office of the prosecutor in Kigali, and that the ministry, you will realise, there was also a letter written to the MRND.  These were things which were being said.  Secondly, there were newspapers which were published.  You can consult them, too, can you not?  It's not Ahmed Mbonyunkiza who has been given the pseudonym, GSJ, who is going to be lying.  I am not inventing anything.  I resigned immediately I became aware of these events.  And this is included in my resignation letter which I wrote in 1992.  I mentioned these events which took place on the 28th.  I did not know that this Tribunal was going to be established, Mr. Robinson.  At the time that was the decision I came to.  Furthermore, I was persecuted for that. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
What we heard in the English was a reference to the conseiller of Kimisangara as a "he".  I don't think there was any mention of a name.  There was a personal pronoun here and I am asking if that's what the witness said or that's an error in the translation. 
THE WITNESS:
Which pronoun did the interpreter use?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
The interpreter used, "he" in reference to something in relation to the conseiller of Kimisangara. 
THE WITNESS:
I used the term "elle" I can give the name of the conseiller, rather, I should have said "she".  Her name was Rose Karushara.  She signed the statute of the MRND and you can see that for yourself.  But you are stopping me from giving you adequate information.  I am able to give clarification when we are talking about the events of the 28th.  

Mr. President, you had asked to limit myself in my explanation.  I cannot do otherwise.  I must respectfully obey the Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I am grateful -- (inaudible) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I think what you are referring to is a document that you showed me and the other parties.  On the first or second day of your testimony, after the end of your session, you showed us a document which I believe was a communiqué by the MDR party in which they were alleging that Rose -- the MDR party which they were alleging that Rose Karushara had participated in demonstrations on the 28th of May and was responsible for violence.  Is that correct? 
A.	The interpreter has just made a small mistake.  The MRND and the MDR were not the same.  It was not the MRND which denounced what Karushara did.  It is rather the MRND which challenged what 
	Rose Karushara had done.  I think that the MDR is the democratic movement.  I am giving you examples of what had happened, and I am providing you with evidence.  This is tangible proof which 
	I am giving you in my capacity as a person who was present during those events.  It should be clear that I am telling you about what happened.  And I am giving you evidence to support what I am saying.  You can experience an event, and you know that there are witnesses who can talk about this, and you would be surprised if you take that witness to the stand.  I am telling you about tangible proof.  I am not here to tell lies.  Do you understand me, Mr. Robinson?  On the 28th of May 1992, if you were to consider what happened at SORWAL and the headquarters of the PL, you would be shocked.  And this is because of the demonstration by the MRND, which was led by Mr. Mathieu, who was minister for justice.  I think that he had left that ministry and he had become secretary general of the MRND.  I am telling you about the events we lived through.  We lived through these events, and I am not here to invent.  I do not want to invent anything.  I have many things in my head and this is why they want to decapitate me so that I am hindered from providing ways of finding the truth.  Even if my head were to be cut off, I would not be stopped from saying the truth, and I would say the truth at the appropriate moment.  Mr. Robinson, I am telling you what happened to me, and I am telling you the truth.  That's what I would like to say to you.  Please understand this as I have said it, and please consider this as being the truth.  Furthermore, I have not said any lies about your client Joseph Nzirorera.  I did not see him.  We didn't have any contact.  I cannot tell lies.  I owe it to myself to speak the truth, tangible truth, and that's why I am here.  And after my testimony I will go back home to Rwanda.  That is the situation. 
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, in the interest of truth, would you be willing to allow us to have a copy of the MRND communiqué in which they were accusing the conseiller so that we can make that an exhibit in this case? 
A.	By leave of the Presiding Judge, I will do that, and I cannot do it without his saying so.  I owe due respect to the Tribunal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are entitled to do something of your own free will to that nature, if you wish.  
THE WITNESS:
Do you want me to show you this document or do you want copies to be made of the document, since I cannot give you this copy for you to keep? 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
What I would ask you to do is give to Mr. Issa the original, and even while you are sitting here, he will go and make the copies, then we will give you the original back and then one of the copies will be marked as Exhibit D. NZ44, and I will offer that into evidence. 
THE WITNESS:
	There is no problem. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I understand that the registry is going to make copies for the parties at the same time, because I would like to be able to look at the document overnight, if that is possible. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Mr. Mbonyukiza, while we are making copies of this document, I will ask you some other question and we will move forward, and I thank you for making that document available.  Is it true that the various parties were making claims about the events that had occurred on May 28th 1992, each accusing the other of responsibility? 
A.	Mr. Robinson, please, could you repeat your question for me? I am sorry, it's because I want to understand it better. 
Q.	Is it true that concerning the events of the 28th of May 1992, the political parties were accusing each other of bearing responsibility for the violence which occurred that day? 
A.	The MRND could not organise these demonstrations, and the objective that Mathieu Ngirumpatse announced as the MRND's objective when he came to the Prime Minister's office, he said that the office of the MRND had been occupied.  I am not lying about Ngirumpatse.  He said, "This building hosted the office of the MRND and now Nsengiyaremye is occupying this building, but we shall not allow him to continue occupying that building."  He was applauded and he add -- I am sorry, Mr. President, I am going to continue to provide explanation for the benefit of Mr. Robinson. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Go ahead. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Ngirumpatse personally stated that he didn't want mention being made of the JMRND and that the youth wing had become an Interahamwe but this had not yet been approved by the MRND.  If you wish, you can go and consult the archives of Radio Rwanda.  There were recordings and you will realise this.  At that period of time we are not going to accept this.  And he spoke, and he shouted at, as I am doing.  We are not going to accept that this office of the 
Prime Minister which previously was our office, to continue to be occupied by 
Dismas Nsengiyaremye.  I am quoting him.  I do not want to continue raising my voice because it's not good.  He is older than I am.  So, he added that the JMRND had become Interahamwe, that the youths of the MRND had become Interahamwe.  Do you understand me, Mr. Robinson?  I think that I have explained the events that took place at the roundabout at the headquarters of the PL, the liberal party.  

Now, the demonstrations came to an end, but please consider what followed, what the Interahamwe did subsequently.  And I explained this when I was referring to events that took place at SORWAL.  People were beaten and some died.  I explained a number of things.  Consider, therefore, the sequence of events in the various secteurs.  People, including Rose Karushara, did certain things.  And I mentioned this in the document.  Fortunately, I have this, document with me and I mentioned my resignation.  Let me tell you this.  I am telling you this rather, I am telling you this because people are trying to speak ill of the Rwandan government in order to say that I am wrong.  Mr. President, I would like the interpreter to be more precise.  I, in fact, wanted to say that it is said that the present Rwandan government is looking for me.  What I am telling you, Mr. Robinson, is the whole truth.  Even if I were to be decapitated, I would still speak the truth.  With regard to the events of the 28th of May 1992, the MRND went ahead of others and Mathieu wrote a communiqué in which he spoke about Mugenzi, that Mugenzi was behind these events but later on they became friends.  You shouldn't take lightly the events that took place.  If Mathieu Ngirumpatse had not created the Interahamwe there wouldn't have been any problems.  He helped the Interahamwe, he helped their programmes come before the congress and they were approved.  If that had not been done we wouldn't have experienced the difficulties that we had in the country.  There was in the establishment of the power wings.  There was the Mugenzi power wing.  They were writing letters to one another as you said.  You said that one party was accusing the other.  However, was it stated that Mugenzi was at the root of the problems?  Let's consider the cases of Mugenzi and Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Later on, they became friends and that brought about the loss of Tutsis and those who were opposed to the MRND.  They wanted to continue to exterminate people.  

Mr. Robinson, I am not afraid of anyone.  I am only afraid of God.  However, I cannot expose my life if I realise that there's imminent danger.  This is why certain measures have been taken.  And I would request the Chamber at the appropriate moment as well as the Rwandan government which is being challenged here.  Yes, you said this.  You said that you have opened the file.  You have challenged the Rwandan government.  And we shall request the ambassador to come here and say whether the Rwandan government has instituted any proceedings against me.  I do not fear anyone.  At the appropriate time, we shall consider this issue.  What I am telling you is that on the 28th of May 1992, the MRND -- let me specify that it was rather, Mathieu, who was the coordinator of all the MRND's activities at the national level at the time.  
(Pages 29 to 39 by Judith Kapatamoyo)





























1530H
A.	Now he was behind these events and he went ahead of the others by drafting a communiqué accusing Mr. Mugenzi. 

Mr. Robinson, do you want me to tell you something else which you are unaware of about Macho?  

Mr. President, I am still referring to the events of 28th May 1992, these have explanations which I am providing.  There is information which was not provided here.  I do apologise to you, Mr. President, Your Honours. 

The president of the republic, Juvenile Habyarimana invited Mathieu together with his choir members, and do you know what happened?  Did he tell you -- did he speak to you about this, Counsel?  Well, I am going to tell you about it myself.  During the time -- I will tell you what happened so that you can better understand Mathieu.  His choir was made up of Tutsis and Hutus, and when they went to sing at Habyarimana's place, he forbid the Tutsis from taking part.  
	
	So you'll understand that there are things that are known but which are not necessarily spoken of.  You would be surprised if I tell you one of those things.  In order to make things amply clear, I would simply like to ask you to call on the other witnesses.  I am not the only witness to testify on what happened with that choir.  I am asking the Prosecutor to go back to Kigali and inquire or investigate from the survivors so that they can confirm this event that I am talking about.  And I am also asking the President of the Trial Chamber to order the Prosecutor to conduct those investigations to clarify this matter so that no impression can be given of blackmail or whatsoever.  The President has stopped me from providing details but there are things that bother me.
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, the witness has talked at length about the choir in relation to Mr. Ngirumpatse.  These are excerpts that do not concern us, and I believe that the reminder which you addressed to the witness is quite necessary, otherwise, we would waste a lot of time delving into matters that are totally irrelevant.  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
Well, Mr. President, I had asked leave of you to delve into these matters. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the way I expect these proceedings to function is that you answer the question that has been put to you.  We don't expect you to make speeches over that; just answer the question, that is all. And trust the proceedings to deal with matters promptly.  Other questions that request for explanations, if they are necessary, we welcome them; you should not be the person making those decisions; just answer the question as concisely as possible, okay? 
THE WITNESS:
I agree with you, Mr. President, but he asked me a question on the various letters that were being written among the parties and I tried to provide details as to the facts as they occurred at that time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
An explanation is not necessary.  Just listen to the next question and answer it concisely. 
THE WITNESS:
Very well. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyukiza, now that -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That same suggestion that we take a break at 4 o'clock. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyukiza, now that we have copies of the documents that you have provided for us, I just want to go to look at that document for a moment.  And can you tell us, is this in fact a communiqué from the MDR at Kimisagara concerning the events of 28th of May 1992.  
A.	That is correct. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would like to offer this communiqué as Exhibit D. NZ44.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
	(Exhibit No. D. NZ44 was admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Mr. Mbonyukiza, the document that you have in front of you may I cite was an original.  It had -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
I am sorry to interrupt.  Before Mr. Robinson goes on to the next question.  We have admitted the document, but it seems to me that the only person that knows its contents is the witness.  I have no idea what the document says.  I can't imagine that Mr. Robinson would know what the document says since we all just received it and he doesn't read Kinyarwanda.  So I think at this point it would be appropriate to have the witness read the document or to have the interpreters give us a translation, but how do we admit something that we don't even know its contents? 
MR. ROBINSON:
He can read the document, Mr. President, if you think that's a useful use of our time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible) 
MR. WEBSTER:
Even if it is not going to be read word-for-word, I would like to understand what it says, so at least you can ask the witness to summarise it or something.  But, you know, I have commented on the way that we admit exhibits in the past and I am still concerned about that.  I won't understand what the document says, but I can't read it now, and now it is in evidence.  So what's the point of introducing it in evidence and nobody knows its content or its value. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I believe I had asked the witness just for the communiqué issued by the MDR in which they were accusing the conseiller of the MRND of the -- relating to the events of May 28th, 1992.  For my purposes, that was enough information; that is, if the Trial Chamber feels like it wants to have the witness read the document so you can know its exact content, I don't have any objection to that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
In general we don't think that's a suitable use of trial time unless there was a specific reason that made it desirable. 
MR. ROBINSON:
So I am going to go forward and if Mr. Webster wants to cover this, there is re-examination; he is free to do that.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyukiza, when you showed me the original of this document, the one you have in front of you, I notice that it had an original signature and an original seal of the MDR party, and I was wondering if you could explain to us how it was that you came into possession of an original document of the MDR party? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel Robinson, for that question.  Counsel Robinson, a short while ago you asked me to read that document, but given the present circumstances -- or the circumstances at the time such communiqué were released regularly.  Whenever an event occurred, a communiqué of this nature could be issued.  Now, this is communiqué number 1 which we have before us.  What I can say is the following:  Even though the MDR subsequently adopted the ideology of genocide because some of its supporters were involved in the genocide, later on the bad seed that was sown did produce bad fruit and the consequence was that the party was dissolved following this ideology of genocide.  However, at the time of the events the MDR had not yet demonstrated that it adopted an ideology of genocide.  It was under those circumstances that I obtained that communiqué.  

	I was in possession of other documents as well, but during the genocide, I told myself that if such documents were found in my home during a search, I may be killed.  I take, for example, the video cassette of my wedding, there were songs about the Inkotanyi, and during that time I was forced to hide all those documents.  I got married in 1993.  At the time I was not a member -- I was not a member of the Inkotanyi, but there were songs about Inkotanyi on my tape that was edited to include songs about the Inkotanyi.  So during that time, I was forced to get rid of those documents and to dump them somewhere.  I buried them, come to think of it.  

Well, Counsel Robinson, as far as this document is concerned, I believe I have given you the circumstances under which I obtained the document.  Now one needed to analyse these events and that is why I needed to come into possession of all these documents and analyse all aspects of the events.  It is on those grounds that I decided to withdraw and to resign from that party.  So I was able to see Mr. Mathieu's letter in which he blamed Mugenzi for all these facts.  But you would understand that they subsequently became friends, good friends at that.  That is the situation, Counsel Robinson. 
Q.	And so when we look at this document D. NZ44 issued by the MDR in which they are blaming the MRND, and then we look at the document which is in evidence, P. 2, which is the communiqué issued by the MRND in which they blame the other parties, it is true, is it not, that from the events of the 
	28th of April -- 28th of May 1992, the political parties were blaming each other for the violence, correct? 
A.	I did not keep the MRND document.  Maybe there was a mistake in the interpretation.  I didn't keep any document from the MRND.  So there must have been a slight mistake in the interpretation.  What I am saying is that -- you have said that the parties were blaming each other.  Well, let us find out why these parties were blaming each other.  That, I believe, should be the key issue to consider; why were these parties blaming each other?  

	If people were killing others, we must try to find out who had the power at that time, so we need to analyse the events of 1993.  But I want to crave the indulgence of the Trial Chamber.  Please do not interrupt me.  A question has been put to me and I am trying to explain the events as they unfolded.  If I am not mistaken, it was in 1992 or was it '93, '92, that's when events took place in Bugesera.  During that -- those events Tutsis died.  Did you receive any information to that effect, Counsel Robinson?  Are you aware of that?  Do you know -- do you know who was minister of justice at the time?  Do you have any information of that person?  Because justice should have been done in the matter of the loss of life by Tutsis during those events.  I do not want to drift away from the question on the parties blaming each other.  What we need to determine is who held power at that time.  I do remember a cartoon in a newspaper which I do not quite remember, some kind of a cartoon depicting President Habyarimana throwing Rwanda into a big hole.  I was not the author of that cartoon, but let us analyse these matters and try to find out why people were blaming each other at the time. 

Now, let me tell you something.  You are an intellectual.  Have you ever tried to find out what happens, for example, when a dictatorship introduces multiparty politics?  Do you know what happens?  I believe that you'll monitor these issues closely.  So let me explain.  Now, I am speaking in general terms, but I will revisit the question later on. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, move to the next question.  
THE WITNESS:
Now to be very specific, Mr. President, let me say that at that time when Habyarimana was requested to share power with political parties and the parties asked the MRND to share power with them, the MRND resisted.  It did not want to give away an iota of its power.  And, Mr. President, I believe I am answering the question that was put to me.  So at that time the MRND used all available forces, all the authorities and officials to ensure that it remained in power.  Several organisations were set up even within the army.  And without going into any details about the army, we can still wonder who provided training for the Interahamwe; who provided military training for the Interahamwe; it was either soldiers or former soldiers.  So my illustration would be of who held power at the time.  And if you look at the communiqué you would see reference to the effect that members of the PL attacked members of our party.  But what happened in reality, I will tell you the truth.  Even Defence witnesses who shall come before this Court will tell you that Interahamwe received military training and this would be confirmed by all witnesses who will come before this Court.  If they fear God and God only, and if they are ready to tell the truth, they will tell you that the Interahamwe received military training.  So military training for these people and the provision of uniforms to people who were civilians, well, those are things that occurred on a daily basis.  They were provided food.  They were provided training.  And then how was it that we can talk about parties blaming each other so lightly?  Don't you think you are taking things rather lightly?  We must look at reality in the face, and let us ask ourselves whether Tutsis did not die throughout this time up to the 1994 genocide.  Did these training -- did this training take place?  If we look at that, then we might come to the conclusion that this document which was drafted by Mathieu was an authentic document that contained the truth.  It is true that the Interahamwe were attacked by members of those parties, then maybe we could say that the document is telling the truth.  But we must go on to find out whether the person who is being blamed for these events, Mugenzi, did not become his friend and belong to the Power wing.  

I am still answering the question.  Mr. President, please, don't think that I am getting out of topic.  I am still within the question, Mr. President.  

So, Counsel Robinson, you say that the parties blamed themselves, they blamed each other and that letters went to and fro among the parties.  Now we have in this document the name of Rose.  Rose's name is included in this letter.  So I will ask you, for example, to go to Kimisagara and investigate.  Maybe you would want to find out about that name, and you will, indeed, find out that the names of these persons are names of persons who had been beaten up and who were subsequently taken to the hospital.  Maybe you would say that GFJ fabricated this document and also fabricated the MDR seal and what have you.  It is not of any interest for me to do any such thing.  I cannot change my testimony.  There are witnesses who may change their testimony, but I cannot.  If the President were to grant me leave, I would tell you a lot more on what happened to me before I came to testify before this Court, but I cannot accept anything whatsoever in relation to these bloody events that affected Rwanda. 

Mr. President, the interpreter did not interpret me properly.  What I said was "I cannot eat the blood of Rwandan children and subordinating myself or subjecting myself to corruption at the same time.  That was the situation.  And, you see, those who corrupted people and who are involved in corrupt practices, well, that is their lot.  I do not do that. 

Mr. Robinson, I invite you to go to Kimisagara to conduct investigations and ask questions on this document.  That was prior to the party's adoption of genocidal stance.  You will then see for yourself the treatment that was meted out to these people.  Well, that was, generally speaking, my answer to the question as to parties blaming each other through various documents and through various letters; that was the situation. 

I am sorry for the introduction of this morning, but because of that, I am bound to refer constantly to what was said this morning without needing -- well, I presume that you are seeking the truth and that you pray to God.  Even as I look at your face, I can tell that whatever the case may be, the last word is the word of God, whatever may obtain. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, before we take our break, the next document that I am going to use with this witness is a report by the public prosecutor for Kigali, Francois Xavier Nsanzuwera about the events of the 
28th of May, and I would like to furnish a copy of this document to the witness so that he can read it over the break so that we can expedite our proceeding when we return. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission granted.  We take the recess now. 
(Court recessed from 1601 to 1628H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  We resume.  We will sit until 5:30 this afternoon. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I have previously distributed the letter that I am about to discuss with this witness in the bundle of the packet of the exhibits I was going to use with this witness a few weeks ago, but I have distributed copies again in case it's not handy. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So Mr. Mbonyukiza, have you had a chance to review the letter of 
	Prosecutor François Xavier Nsanzuwera? 
A.	(Microphone not activated)
MR. ROBINSON:  
Can we have some translation of witness's answer, please?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, his microphone is not on, so he cannot be heard. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have read the letter. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So the first thing I would like you to do is to read the letter out loud so that the Trial Chamber can understand its contents because it is just only in French; it is not such a long letter.  So can you please read the letter slowly and then I am going to ask you some questions about its contents. 
A.	Thank you.  Before I read this letter, I would like to inform you that the Prosecutor had asked me to read a letter in Kinyarwanda and Mr. Robinson should have done the same, but that was not done.  So I would request that the translation of that letter be made so that all the parties can become aware of the contents of that letter. 
(Pages 40 to 46 by Sithembiso Moyo)



























1630H
THE WITNESS (continued):
Now, I'm going to read the letter given to me by counsel.  The subject is a detailed report on the political disturbances of the 28th May '92.  "Honourable Minister, I have the honour to bring to you the detailed report on the disturbances which were political in nature, which took place in the capital during the days of 28th and 29th May 1992.  On the 28th of May 1992, the youth of the MRND Interahamwe made a march from the roundabout to the prime minister's office in Kimihurura.  The letter in advising the préfet of the préfecture of Kigali-ville is dated 19th May 1992, and the permit was provided on the 27th of May 1992.  

"During the same day of 28th May 1992, there was to be a rally of the PSD, the Social Democratic Party in Nyamirambo.  That march and the meeting unfortunately led to disturbances of a political nature.  Youths who were members of the association -- associations of youths affiliated to political parties carried out acts of vandalism and looting.  The disturbances between the youth of the party allegedly began at the Kigali roundabout before the beginning of the march by the Interahamwe of the MRND.  The confrontations also took place in Kimicyanga (phonetic) on the road of the Interahamwe.  

"In the meantime, there were also confrontations between the various youths and there were attempts to loot the headquarters of the party, MDR and CDR, and the headquarters of Petrorwanda company were ransacked.  Vehicles belonging to individuals were also damaged.  The vehicles that were most affected were those whose registrations included HB and GB." 

"Why would people from these préfectures be subjected to the anger of these gangs of youths from the capital?  Gangs of youth who are natives of poor préfectures, who are also overpopulated in the south, namely, Gitarama and Butare."  That was a question.  So there's a question mark at the end of that sentence.  

"That is the crux of the matter.  I do not know the ethnic composition or regional or political composition of this capital, but, nonetheless, the Interahamwe are not tolerated.  

"The other observation to be made from the events of 28th May 1992, is that the forces of law and order aided in the con- -- looked at the confrontations without doing anything.  It is true that the gendarmerie behaved well during the various stages the capital has gone through, and it is unfortunate that the demonstrators are still carrying bladed weapons during the demonstrations.  With regard to the proceedings that have been instituted, it should be noted that 44 people have been arrested by the gendarmerie and -- and they are being detained in prison.  After questioning, the Office of the Prosecutor has placed under arrest 19 individuals whereas 25 were released.  The first group will be brought before the Trial Chamber tomorrow, 4th of June 1992.  Those who are arrested have been prosecuted for vandalism of property and aggravated theft.  Mr. Minister, these are the -- this is the information I wish to bring to your information."  

And the document is signed by the office -- by the Prosecutor, François Xavier Nsanzuwera, and it bears a signature.  The letter is also copied to the Prosecutor General of the Court of Appeal in Kigali.  The letter is also marked confidential on the first page at the top.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Mbonyunkiza.  That was an excellent job.  And can you tell us, does this accurately report on the events of the 28th of May as far as you're concerned?  
A.	Thank you for your appreciation, Counsel.  It was a simple letter.  It's not an excellent job.  It's just a normal job that I did.  I would like to inform you, what I can tell you is that I think the interpreter did not interpret what I stated.  May the interpreter -- excuse me, I had started my statement in French.  

Let me say one thing, Mr. Robinson.  As this letter stands, it even includes the day of the 29th.  So you will understand that there were events which followed or came after the demonstration.  And these went on during the night and the following day.  In fact, the letter is speaking of the 28th and the 29th, and you should bear that in mind.  

Let me say something regarding this letter.  It is giving a report of what happened.  And I'm going to speak to you about someone who is not neutral, and yet he works for justice.  He is trying to say things in the way that they happened.  First of all, you need to know who François Nsanzuwera was.  You need to know the position he occupied and who gave him that position.  And then we shall examine this letter.  For the time being, that is the answer I can give you.  
Q.	As far as you're concerned, are the contents of this letter accurate?  
A.	The contents of this letter is not correct.  There is no neutrality that we can see in this letter.  There's no neutrality that can be seen from this letter.  Furthermore, the author falls short of speaking the whole truth.  He is saying that it's the youths of the parties which -- who began the confrontations.  If we were to analyse this letter on a paragraph-by-paragraph basis, you will realise -- you, in your capacity as an attorney, in your capacity as someone who safeguards the law, you, yourself, will realise the same.  We are going to analyse this letter point by point so that we can understand it.  We are going to see what was said during these events and what was done.  There you are.  
Q.	Now, the Prosecutor, François Xavier Nsanzuwera, was he not a trustworthy individual at this time?  
A.	You cannot put that question to me because you have the letter.  Maybe I can put the question to you, but I do not have that right.  It's up to the presiding Judge to do so.  This is evidence that you have before you.  It's your own evidence.  Maybe you can come tell us how François Nsanzuwera was, what was his position, as I have done myself.  I have shown you things in detail, and this could help in the discovery of the truth here and now.  
Q.	Okay.  Well, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, can you tell us then what's the -- what was your assessment of François Xavier Nsanzuwera and his trustworthiness or credibility at the time of this letter?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Excuse me.  I think this question lacks foundation.  Can we establish if the witness was personally acquainted with François Xavier Nsanzuwera, if he knew him by reputation, if he knew him as a public figure.  I think we're a bit premature to lance -- to go right into the issue of his assessment of this person without establishing whether he knew him or not or how he came to know him.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, it's not a problem.  I can do that.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, can you tell us, did you know François Xavier Nsanzuwera personally or by reputation?  
A.	You can even get to know François Xavier Nsanzuwera through this document.  What I can say is that I heard mention made of him.  I didn't have any legal matter with him.  I think that's what you -- that's how you refer to it in law.  I have not even had any conversation with him.  However, if we analyse his letter, we can get to know who François Xavier Nsanzuwera is.  That is the answer I can give you.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, we're trying to assess the accuracy of this letter, okay?  So we want to understand what you believe about the author and what you believe about the contents.  So my first question -- and Mr. Webster has asked me to bring this out -- is what you know about the author.  So can you tell us what you know about François Nsanzuwera that bears on how we should treat the contents of this letter?  
A.	You are speaking about what I know about Nsanzuwera.  What I know about Nsanzuwera, if I'm not mistaken, is that there was an event which took place within the country, and he had to flee the country.  That's if I'm not mistaken.  I don't remember the event very well because it took place a while ago.  He didn't flee during the Habyarimana regime.  Rather, it was during the present regime, Pasteur Bizimungu's regime.  I know that he fled the country, and that's all I know about him.  I can see his name on this letter.  However, this letter can reveal to us who François Nsanzuwera is.  How was he brave enough to write such things?  As a lawyer or a man of the law, he should have been unbiased.  You can see the contents of the letter yourself.  I am not the author.  I can show you a paragraph, and through that paragraph, you will realise who François Xavier Nsanzuwera is.  Even if I were to see him, I wouldn't be able to recognise him.  However, we can tell who François Nsanzuwera is through this letter which he referred to as being confidential.  
Q.	Okay.  
A.	We shall examine the letter so that we can understand it, and you did well to bring this letter forward.  
Q.	Well, let's look at the letter and the first paragraph that begins with the words "On the date of 28 May 1992," which is the second paragraph of the letter, that indicates, does it not, that the Interahamwe had authorisation for the demonstration on the 28th of May; correct?  
A.	Please can you repeat your question so I understand you better.  
Q.	In the second paragraph of the letter, it indicates that the Interahamwe had authorisation for the demonstration of the 28th of May; correct?  
A.	Yeah, there's no mention made of the person who requested for authorisation in order to be involved in that demonstration.  I would ask you to read the paragraph -- this paragraph properly up to where it states 27th May 1992.  
Q.	And does it not say that the prefect of Kigali had provided authorisation on the 27th of May 1992, for the march of the Interahamwe?  
A.	I'm going to read the letter over again, especially this paragraph.  "The youth of the MRND Interahamwe carried out a march from the roundabout towards the prime minister's office in Kimihurura.  A letter advising the préfet of the préfecture of Kigali-ville is dated 19th May 1992, and the authorisation allegedly was given on the 27th May 1992."  Mr. Robinson, you cannot say that the Interahamwe had received authorisation to go on the march.  Let me proceed.  It is from this passage that you see that mention is not made of anyone.  Maybe it's a nuance and he wanted to refer to the Interahamwe.  You made my job difficult right from the beginning.  I intended to say that when someone makes your job difficult, you can do likewise, but here -- here the author does not refer to the Interahamwe.  Maybe we can take that for granted, so that we can make your job easy.  I'm going to make your job easy, and in this paragraph there's no mention of Interahamwe.  There's nowhere where you see "Interahamwe," and it is said nowhere in this paragraph that the Interahamwe asked for authorisation.  Let's take it that the Interahamwe (sic) was granted to the Interahamwe, shall we?  But if we were to go along that direction, we will be lying.  This is why I have asked you to bring out the truth about everything.  If the MRND had asked for authorisation and Mathieu Ngirumpatse had asked -- had signed the request for authorisation, he's the one who named the youth of the MRND "Interahamwe." So you'll understand, we are going to look at these issues and we shall realise that this letter reveals who Nsanzuwera is and his way of going about things.  I do agree with you regarding the question that you put to me, but don't let's speak about the Interahamwe.  Let's say that it was the MRND who had requested for authorisation to go on the march, but we also need to make observations on this letter.  That's what I can say.  That way we can proceed.  
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, turning to the next paragraph in this report, it indicates that the vehicles which had been damaged have certain letters in their license plates, HB, and GB.  Do you see that?  
A.	Exactly.  That's what I wanted to say to you about François Xavier Nsanzuwera.  As you can see in this paragraph, there is HB and GB, and mention is also made of Gitarama and Butare.  So you will understand how, in his view, he saw people from Gitarama and Butare who were ransacking the town.  François Xavier Nsanzuwera had, therefore, asked for identity cards for him to be able to know the native areas of these people, and it's from that that he was able to reach the conclusion that those who were damaging vehicles, whose vehicles bore HB and GB, he came to the conclusion that that was the crux of the matter.  

And this is why, furthermore, he wanted that this letter remain confidential.  Was he able to ask these people from Gitarama and Butare to show him their identity cards?  As a man of the law, he should not have made such a statement.  This is the answer I can give you, Counsel.  We are going to look at this letter step by step, and you will understand.  
Q.	Before we -- 
A.	If you go further down -- 
Q.	Excuse me.  
A.	I will stop.  I was going to give you another answer, but I'll stop here.  
Q.	Okay.  I just want to interrupt you, and so the Trial Chamber and all of us know, "HB" is cars from Ruhengeri, and "GB" is cars from Gisenyi; is that correct?  
A.	It's very good for you to provide that explanation.  It's clear that you were told about this, and you have made an analysis because you have given an answer.  I understand that you have had a discussion with your client about this matter.  So consider these letters, HB and GB, and consider the préfectures of Gitarama and Butare.  As a lawyer, you can confirm something after seeing tangible evidence.  With that evidence in hand, you can place that on a piece of paper, and you will sign your document.  But how is it that he was able to say that the youths from Gitarama and Butare came from poor areas?  

And he is despising them.  You can understand this yourself.  This is a document which was written by a lawyer, and this is not what people were thinking at the time.  There was division.  And even this lawyer has labelled people, saying that these people come from such and such a place.  That is the clarification I wanted to provide, and I invite you, Mr. Robinson, in your capacity as a lawyer, to reflect on what I've said.  
Q.	Just so we understand the import of this letter, it's true, is it not, that what Mr. Nsanzuwera was saying is that the vehicles which were damaged were from the north, and the people who were doing the damage was from the south; is that correct?  
A.	That's not correct.  We have to be clear.  Perhaps I'm not able to make myself understood.  You're defending some people.  But the truth is this:  How was that person able to identify those people?  Someone throws a stone and he asks for their identity and finds out that they're from Gitarama.  Someone else is asked to hand over their identification after they attacked a car, and that's how we can tell where they're from.  I don't agree with that.  I can't agree with that.  I can't say that it was the HB and GB cars that were attacked.  I cannot agree with you.  

However, we should ask ourselves about the events and about what happened at that time.  Attacks were launched against some people who were opposed to the MRND and who were Tutsis.  These activities were not as widespread as they were in 1994.  What I can tell you is that the content of the letter illustrates that person's position on these matters.  

If I were a lawyer, I would try to phrase things differently and talk about how people ask for authorisation to organise a demonstration and how the demonstration got out of hand.  I would say that enquiries would have to be conducted to know more.  At the end he doesn't say anything about what happened.  They don't say anything about the origins of those people, if they were from Gitarama, Butare.  What about the 44 persons from Gitarama?  Do you think they would want to organise the demonstration alone in Kigali?  It would have been better if Nsanzuwera mentioned the people and showed the photocopies of the identity cards of those persons so he could be able to say that people from such and such a region committed these various acts.  Without having to generalise and simply say that people from that region or this region who are poor or they're criminals, this is the type of language that shows that there was division in the country.  That's all I can say about this man we are referring to now.  
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, what I get out of this letter is that the public prosecutor conducted an investigation and determined that the Interahamwe had authorisation for their demonstration, that those who attacked were from areas primarily from the opposition, Gitarama and Butare, and those who were victims were primarily from the north, Ruhengeri, Gisenyi, where the MRND was strong; and that it's his conclusion that the Interahamwe were not tolerated during this demonstration.  Now, would you say that that -- that that -- that Mr. Nsanzuwera accurately or inaccurately accounted for the events on the 28th of May?  
A.	Very well.  I would like you to tell me whether there were political parties known as Butare and Gitarama -- sorry.  I would like you to tell me whether you were aware of the existence of parties known as HB and GB.  You see, you are talking about opposition parties and referring to Gitarama and Butare at the same time.  Now, if there were to be a party identified as Gitarama and Butare, then one could say that the parties known as Gitarama and Butare attacked the other parties known as Gisenyi and Ruhengeri.  We would, therefore, conclude that that was the origin of the problems that Rwanda encountered at that time.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't want to -- to object, but what I observe is that the witness is being asked the same question repeatedly.  Because he's actually given a very complete answer to the initial question, and Mr. Robinson rephrased the same question which is what is opening up the issue for more debate when the witness's answer a while ago was actually quite complete.  Mr. Robinson re-read his understanding of the letter and put it to the witness again, and the witness had already stated that he did not agree with this characterisation.  He gave a very lengthy explanation and a nuanced explanation why that was.  So we can continue down this line, but the only thing that's going to happen is that the witness is going to keep reiterating his position, and everyone is going to be getting tired.  Now the witness has given a full answer.  We can move on to something else, or we can discuss this ad nauseum, but the witness is not going to be moved.  He has an analysis of this letter that the Defence -- or Mr. Robinson does not share.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I can move on here.  And I think first I would like to offer this letter as Exhibit D. NZ45.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ45 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, just -- I hope the last question about this letter -- are you aware that François Xavier Nsanzuwera has been employed and is employed by the Office of the Prosecutor here at the ICTR?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting to that question as being irrelevant.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Do you want to hear from me on this, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  We'll permit the witness to answer.  
THE WITNESS:
This is what I can say.  I don't know whether there is some intimidation or not.  Now, whether he's an employee of this Tribunal or not, I stand by what I have said, and I do not intend to budge.  When you want to tell the truth, you do so openly, publicly, and officially.  Maybe this is the system that is in place and which is functioning and which I am not aware of -- well, I don't know whether he is a staff of this Tribunal or not.  I do not know.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, that last sentence could have been your entire answer. 
(Pages 47 to 53 by Wendy Molnar)












     1712H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, now we are going to turn to the Bible, which is your letter of the 9th of June 1992, which is Exhibit P. 4, and I want to ask you some questions about this letter.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Now, the Prosecutor has now supplied me with an English version of this letter that he says is accurate, and what I would like to do is offer the English version as Exhibit P. 4A -- excuse me, the French should be 4A, and this would be P. 4B. 
(Exhibit No.P. 4A and  P. 4B admitted)
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, I did distribute the translations -- the revised English translation a few minutes ago, and I gave the first set of copies to Mr. Robinson and asked him to distribute them to the other Defence counsel.  But when I reread it, I am still dissatisfied with this translation and I raised the issue in the booth with the language section, and we can look at it -- I didn't distribute it to CMS or to the Court because two paragraphs have been repeated and there are inaccuracies still in the translation.  So I have what was given to me this morning as the revised translation.  I can distribute that.  But, quite frankly, I think it needs to be revised yet again, and I'm going to do that, or we can serve what I have received. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, we will take what exists, but you understand the reason why it is unnecessary to be heated on these language issues.  They are administrative issues and they can best be resolved in a probative manner.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I was trying to resolve them administratively twice, Your Honour, by bringing it to the attention of the language section directly, both here and up on the seventh floor, and I can show you what we have received and I can correct it orally.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's not necessary.  We accept it now, and if there is an agreed corrected version that's produced at a later stage, then we will replace it here. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  No problem.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But this is an issue which should be resolved in a non-contentious manner. 
MR. WEBSTER:
There is no contention.  In fact, Mr. Robinson -- I gave it to Mr. Robinson.  He was happy to receive it.  It's only after I gave him those copies that I reread it and realised there was additional -- there was additional need for revision. 

MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I think this might be a good time to appreciate that, when the Accused have some problems with the official versions done by the language section, there may be some basis for that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is what I was referring to. 
MR. ROBINSON:
If the Witness --
MR. WEBSTER:
Not to extend the discussion, I am referring to the same thing because I met with Mr. Robinson on several occasions, and I met with the language section on several occasions, and there is an exchange of correspondence that goes back several months on this issue.  So we have been doing everything possible to resolve it administratively, both with the language section and with the Accused, but we arrive here because there was no consensus. 
MR. ROBINSON:
If the witness could be given the French version.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And perhaps, it's up to you, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, if you want to refer to your original; if you have that in front of you, you can do that.  But we are going to now read your letter of resignation and go over that in detail.  So if you prefer to just look at the original, you could do that, or if you would like to receive the copy from the registry, we can do that, but the exhibit is P. 4.  
THE WITNESS:  
Mr. President, with your leave, I would like to locate this document in my own files. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I think the witness would like to look into his binder and find his original and refer to that, while we look at copies, which is fine with me. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  You are permitted, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:  
Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
For the benefit of the Court, I can hand up two of the revised -- the more recent revisions of the English text to -- to Judges -- to the Presiding Judge and Judge Short. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We just need one extra copy. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, what we are going to do now is just like you did a little earlier with the letter of Mr. Nzirorera.  I am going to ask you first to read the French, and that way we will be able to get an accurate English translation from the booth.  And then after you've done that, I'm going to ask you questions about the elements of your letter.  
A.	Are you asking me to reread the letter?  Or does he have to leave it here, or should he take it back?  I didn't quite understand.  I didn't quite understand what you asked me to do, Counsel. 
Q.	I'm asking you to just read your own letter now.  We've finished with the letter of Nzirorera, but just slowly read your own letter.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel Robinson. 

"Mbonyunkiza, Ahmed, chairman of JMRND in Kigali-ville préfecture, member of Nyarugenge communal committee --"  

I was reading the caption, the title.

"-- of Mbonyunkiza, chairman of JMRND in Kigali-ville préfecture, a member of Nyarugenge communal committee, Kigali.  

Kigali, 9 June 1992. 

The national secretary of the MRND in Rwanda, Kigali. 

Subject:   Resignation. 

Sir, in spite of the elections of 19 December 1991 and of 5 January 1992, electing me to the position of chairman of JMRND and member of the MRND, or member of the communal committee of the MRND in Nyarugenge, following the events which signaled incompatibility between certain leaders of the Interahamwe committee who want to sow seeds of discord between members of the MRND and opposition parties, particularly the MDR, the PL, and the PSD parties, following the events of the 28th of May 1992 between persons referred to as the Interahamwe and the youths of the MDR, the 
PL, and the PSD parties, following a serious injury to my head caused by one of the demonstrators of the MDR, the PL, and the PSD during the women's demonstration which took place recently, and in respect of which I requested your assistance to enable me to purchase some medication because I was yet to obtain a job, a salary job, and that you willfully disregarded my insistence following the personal insecurity I am presently facing from supporters and members of the MDR, the PL, and the PSD, because of those persons known as the Interahamwe, and despite the fact that I demonstrated my innocence and made efforts in favour of all the youths from various parties, irrespective of whether they were from the opposition or from the MRND itself, of which -- a youth wing of which I was chairman, I am not citing the inner pictures of the national secretary, but the truth.  You wanted to give the entire MRND youth a name and you wanted to call it "Interahamwe", whereas you did not know exactly -- you did not know yourself exactly where that name and its objectives come from. 

I take this opportunity again to remind you that the JMRND started before that organisation or organ of the MRND party.  It should remain an organ, Mr. National Secretary.  It should remain an organ of the party, but not the youth wing of the party. 

You knew, and even know yourself, that the objective of the JMRND was to peacefully collaborate with all youths of the country through MRND propaganda without political, ethnic, or regional discrimination as desired by the chairman of the party himself. 

Despite the efforts made, the courage and bravery demonstrated by the JMRND committee to all youths of the party, that is, the JMRND, and considering that the name "Interahamwe" has taken a turn for the worse at the national level, as well as at the international level, for those reasons, 
Mr. National Secretary, I wish to officially submit my resignation with effect from this day, 9 June 1992.  This is what true democracy is all about."  

Signed, Ahmed Mbonyunkiza; copy, chairman of the MRND party, national level, Kigali; chairman of the MRND in Kigali-ville préfecture, Habyarimana, Jean; and chairman of the MRND in Nyarugenge commune, who was at the time (inaudible); and the chairman of the MRND committee in Cukiro, whose name I forget; and the chairman of the MRND in Kicukiro who at the time was (inaudible) in Kigali.

That is the word-for-word content of my letter.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I would like to thank the interpreter for an excellent job.  That was word-for-word how I read the letter when I look at it in French and interpret it in my head into English.  And what I suggest is that we simply rely on the transcript, and we can make a copy of that transcription and enter it as an exhibit at a later time. 
MR. ROBINSON:
That's fine, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Mr. Mbonyunkiza, this letter, first of all, it's true, is it not, that the letter is critical of the Interahamwe? 
A.	That is correct.  There are two issues or, may I say, three points in this letter.  The first is that it demonstrates how the Interahamwe brought about tension between the various youth wings of the parties because the Interahamwe went after youths of the youth wings of other parties. 

Secondly, it demonstrates that Mathieu Ngirumpatse had christened the youth wing of the MRND as the Interahamwe.  And the third point is that it demonstrates how Mathieu Ngirumpatse did not come to my assistance on the other circumstances which I described. 

In a nutshell, the letter clearly gives reason why I had to dissociate myself from those people and from the killings they were involved in.  I read all those points from this letter.  That is what I can say in respect of this letter.
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I put it to you that this letter is also my Bible, and it's my Bible because, in giving all of the reasons for your resignation, you not once make any mention of any plan by Mr. Ngirumpatse, or anyone else, to exterminate Tutsis, correct? 
A.	Well, it's a good thing you put that question to me, Counsel.  As someone who was not very interested in these ethnic issues, I could not talk about it up front, so you must note that I said he had christianed (sic) the youths of the party as being Interahamwe.  

There is a sentence which, ironically, conveys my thoughts.  "You knew, yourself, clearly, where this name and these objectives came from."  That is ironic because he referred to it as, well, because of this letter, let me speak in another language.  What I'm saying is that, as far as the content of this letter goes, it was my prediction of what would happen, and you subsequently found out what happened, and that is why we are sitting here today.  It is because of what the Interahamwe did, the facts, as we know them, that were the result of the actions of the Interahamwe.  Why are we sitting here today?  That is why we are sitting here today.  Had it not been for that, we could all have dismissed (sic), and even these Accused persons could go back to their homes, because I know that their families need them too.   But things happened.  Events did occur, and these were events committed by 
Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and that is why we are sitting here today.  

That is the answer I can give to your answer -- to your question, rather.  But there is another point, Mr. Robinson.  Is it always a good thing to respect people?  Even if someone hurts you or even tries to kill you, you can still give him some milk, even if you know that that person is about to kill you.   Jesus said if someone strikes you on one cheek, please, show him the other cheek.  Well, if you are able to run away and save yourself, you may as well do so. 

So let us set aside these proverbs.  You see, the content of the letter, the underpinning content of the letter, don't you believe that people died, killed by the Interahamwe, Counsel Robinson?  The Interahamwe who were trained and who received weapons, and that was done by 
Mathieu Ngirumpatse?  Of course, in alliance with other persons.  

So what I'm trying to say is that I could not write down all the details in this letter.  And by the way, I didn't know that this Tribunal was going to be set up some day.  So that is the reality as I am depicting it to you, and I pray you to accept it as such.
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I think just one last question and we will take a break.  But I'm suggesting to you that this letter contains the real reasons for your resignation, that the JMRND and you were pushed aside by the Interahamwe, and that your assistance for money for your medical care was turned down, and that's really why you resigned, isn't that true?  And isn't it true that this whole business of the extermination of Tutsis and axes and songs is something you made up after the fact when you found yourself in prison in Kigali and you're looking for a way out?  
A.	Well, I don't know whether I am allowed to laugh in court.  I'm really sorry.  Mr. President, I'm sorry.  Well, oh Lord, Jesus Christ, there are some things which really -- which are difficult to understand.  You say that to leave prison, you think that I could have negotiated my way out of prison?  No.  No.  I'm telling you the truth.  My trial was a public trial.  The government of Rwanda was never involved in my trial.  I never negotiated anything with whosoever to come here as a Prosecution witness. 

Now, what I'm telling you is the truth.  And by the way, this is what I can tell you further.  I have been told things by the witness section.  They asked me to communicate with them and that I should not disclose these things to anybody, not even to the government.  Even my wife, with whom I have had three children, I haven't told her why I have come to Arusha.  I just told her that I was coming to provide some explanations to the Tribunal as I had been requested.  But she was funnily surprised because somebody from the witness protection section went to visit her, and she then found out that I have come here to testify.  Well, there are many problems that arose, and now the witness protection section is doing its level best to sort those issues out.  

But, notwithstanding, let me tell you that the government of Rwanda never interfered in my -- or with my trial.  I was acquitted and released, and I never even thought that I would be coming to testify against Ngirumpatse and others in this trial.  Really. 

Now, when I was detained, I had just been previously involved in other activities; namely, providing assistance to genocide survivors, to orphans and what have you.  So I was associated with issues that I had not been involved in.  But once I was in prison, I noticed how deplorable the conditions there were.  I saw mothers suffering to provide food for their close relatives and husbands who were in prison, and at that time Mathieu and the others were living rather comfortably while others were suffering.  So I thought that I could make a contribution, either in respect of those persons whom I was helping, or regarding those persons whom I have met in prison and who were living in inhuman conditions.  
Counsel Robinson, let me tell you that there are people working in this Tribunal who have worked with human rights associations and who know how much I put in to provide assistance to orphans.  They provided us some goods.  You see, some people had thought that I had died in prison, but they were surprised to see me later on.  

Now, if you consider how I was received when I got to prison, you would be surprised.  I noted that people were suffering here and there.  Seriously, and so my conscience led me to make a contribution.  
So the Rwandan government has never asked me to come here to testify against these people.  It would really be an absurdity for the Rwandan government to ask me to come and testify and then begin to -- and then I would still be a wanted man by the Rwandan government.  This is what is happening.  

Now, before man or, rather, before God, Counsel Robinson, I want to tell you that I showed the Habyarimana regime the truth, and I will still stand for the truth before this government.  I am not afraid of anything.  I cannot lie.  I would rather die than lie.  So rather than lie, I would prefer to die.  That is in my nature, and that's how God created me.  And I say this to you again:   The government played no role what so ever in my release.  I was detained.  I was tried and subsequently released.  If you want, I can give you the documents -- the release note.  You can look at it.  Maybe you can use it as an exhibit.  I am ready to provide everything, and I am ready to tell you the truth, and that is it, and that is the truth, the raw truth, nothing else, nothing else behind all of that.  

Please, don't entertain any thoughts of the government in one way or the other assisting to release me.  I want to insist on that point.  Maybe you -- you -- you -- well, one of you said that I was a super witness, and that's why I'm making these comments.  

I have finished, Mr. President. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. Mbonyunkiza, that was a very long answer, and I think your letter speaks for itself.  

On that note, I would ask, Mr. President, if we could take our adjournment for the evening and we will come on to something else tomorrow. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much time do you think you have left?
MR. ROBINSON:
I think a few hours.  It's not much material, but it takes a while.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  What we are going to do tomorrow morning is that we are going to continue in Courtroom 3 at 8:45.  The cross-examination of this witness will continue, and then at approximately 10 a.m. Mr. Sow will take the floor to cross-examine the Witness G from The Hague.  So that's basically our scheduling for tomorrow.  We take the adjournment now. 

MR. WEBSTER:
I think you should communicate that we would gather in the afternoon, Your Honour, possibly with this witness again. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  (Unintelligible) Mr. Robinson said a couple of hours.  We will have a bit less than that, and I thought I would wait until 10 o'clock before we can make that assessment.  

Yes, Mr. Witness?
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, may I take one moment to explain something?  With your permission, I would like to meet with you.  I don't believe that we can proceed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness -- 
THE WITNESS:  
By sowing seeds on rock.  I have serious concerns about these proceedings. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's -- it's -- it's -- you will have to rely on us to determine how and when we should meet.  We have made an order requiring the registrar to provide certain information, and we do not think it is appropriate for us to meet with you before that occurs.  We expect that order to be complied with tomorrow -- during the course of tomorrow morning, and at that stage we will be in a position to give a further direction as to how we will dispose of this matter.  But at the moment we cannot accede to your request to meet with you at this time.  

I think we can take the adjournment now. 
(Court adjourned at 1744H)
