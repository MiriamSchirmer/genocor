P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session, today, Wednesday, the 27th of May 2009, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al., Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.

Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Registrar. 

The appearances are the same. 

Good morning, Mr. Karemera.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:  
How are you this morning?  
THE WITNESS:
I am well, Mr. President.  I am not too tired yet. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

And Mr. Webster smiles.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I thought the Court was going to ask me how I was doing and if I was too tired as well. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You have a reputation, Mr. Webster.  I don't have to ask that question. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay.  Your Honour, before we get started this morning, I wanted to raise something with the Court.  It's actually the matter we addressed when we concluded yesterday, and it's about the time standards, because we've been at it with Mr. Karemera for several days now, and I am a bit concerned that I have not covered the ground that I had anticipated to cover at this stage.  And while -- judging by the updates from Mr. Hometowu, I have a little over four hours left.  Quite frankly, I -- looking at my outline and looking at the pace by which we are proceeding, I have serious reservations about being able to complete the cross-examination within that period.  

So before I get started, I wanted to address the matter with the Court and get some guidance from the Chamber about how long I'll be allowed to proceed.  If I am going to be limited, I'd prefer to know that at the outset so that I can abandon some aspects of the outline that I had put together.  And if not, I would still use the information that the Court could give me at this stage to plan -- to plan how I move forward.  Now, I'm sure the Court --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just to tell you a preliminary -- as you know, we don't -- we have never applied these rules inflexibly.  So you have to give us an indicative -- indication of what your application is in more precise terms.  We think that -- that you have contributed to the -- the time, because the process has been rather argumentative.  

You made a comment at the commencement of your examination-in-chief which did seem to me to suggest an unreal assessment of what -- of what equity meant.  You seemed to suggest that you thought that cross-examining each of the Accused for three times the examination-in-chief would be roughly -- give you roughly parity, which didn't seem to -- to follow logically to me.  

So I don't know exactly what it is you're requesting. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Well, let me restate that, Your Honour, because that was not my intention.  In fact, I've never tried to project what would be an equitable relationship between the length of time spent in direct and the length of time spent in cross, even with respect to Defence.  I -- if I recall, my comments were really an attempt to compare the way we are proceeding now during the Defence case with how we were operating two years ago when we were in the Prosecution phase.  

So let me withdraw that comment or clarify it.  I'm not suggesting that I should have three times the amount of time that the Defence took.  All I'm suggesting is that I have an outline that I think is concise and that I'd like to cover it in its entirety.  It does not cover every aspect of our case, but it covers the salient points.  And at the pace that we're proceeding now, I don't think I can do that within the four hours that remains.  

Realistically, I think we should budget the entire day for the completion of my cross-examination.  Now, that's not to say that I intend to take every minute that's available to me during the course of the day.  I'm going to move forward as expeditiously and as quickly as possible.  And if I can finish before the end of the day, I would be quite pleased and I would have met my target.  

But in term -- for planning purposes my suggestion to the Court is that I not be limited today, that I be allowed to use the entire day, if I need to use it, and that tomorrow be reserved for the redirect, to the extent that the Defence teams would like to conduct a redirect.  So that's the application.  

I'm going to move as quickly as possible.  I've -- I will try to be less provocative in my questions to Mr. Karemera.  But realistically, that's -- that's the forecast that I see. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Diagne, before you respond directly to Mr. Kare -- Mr. Webster, I wanted to know if you already have an idea of the extent of your redirect examination or what it's likely to encompass. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, good morning.  Your question is difficult for me to answer for two reasons.  Firstly, because the redirect subsequent to the cross-examination, you know -- it will be premature for me to answer your question.  A time -- the estimates are not very precise enough.  That is why I may not be in a position to answer your question for that reason.  

The other reason is that I am unaware of what he is going to cover today, how he is going to do it, and what we will need to do.  He talked about obtaining a target, and my goal will be to protect my target.  So I think it will be not cautious to answer that question.  I know that you answered that question in view of organising the activities of the Chamber.  

But if you allow me to answer the Prosecutor's request -- I was telling you yesterday, Your Honour, that Mr. Karemera is a witness but he is also an accused.  And to authorise the Prosecutor to have a certain lat -- some latitude with he -- regard to him, allows him to adjust himself -- adjust at all times.  And that is not very normal.  I don't quite understand this Prosecutor and his disorderly requests and his disclosures whenever he wants.  

I believe that at the time, from the first year when he was arrested, everything was already in place.  And I don't quite understand what is going on now, and I am a bit disturbed by that one.  I'm more or less Mr. Karemera's spokesperson, and he's quite frustrated.  It seems that people are still researching, and that is not something that is a good thing.  And I cannot condone this.  

So I would like to pray you to maintain the four hours that are remaining.  Mr. Karemera is not like the witnesses that have been brought.  He is both a witness and an accused.  And everything ought to have been ready with respect to him.  And I'm telling you, Your Honour, that -- insist that it would be unfair for you to give the Prosecutor one more minute to -- and by answering your question, I will consult with Maître Sow, and during the day I will provide you the answer which you expect from us.  

We were perplexed and skeptical because we don't know exactly what the Prosecutor is going to use his time today for.  It is true that it is a bit an -- a bit odd with respect to the way which our redirect is going to be carried.  But I'll consult with Maître Sow, and I will give you a satisfactory answer during the day.  And I'm excuse -- and I would like to excuse myself for not having answered you directly. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, what we think is reasonable is this:  That we will -- as I said, we -- we don't want to be inflexible.  But we don't want any abuses either.  Now, we are thinking that it might be possible to allow you to go up to the mid-afternoon break.  So that would be the sort of limitation.  

Because the four-hour session would normally have ended around lunchtime today -- or, roughly around lunchtime -- or, just after lunch.  So we are thinking that -- making an extension up to the mid-afternoon break.  But we'll be monitoring and see how -- how you -- that the time is properly used.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
All right.  Thank you.  So, once again, good morning to everyone.
ÉDOUARD KAREMERA, 
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued) 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And good morning to you, Mr. Karemera.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
Q.	I'd like to pick up with your diary or your handwritten agenda, which was distributed to the parties as document R2.  It's a document that is already admitted into evidence.  R2 is actually a typewritten version of your notebook, Mr. Karemera.  If you would prefer to refer to your own handwritten text, I'm sure the registry could provide you with the exhibit that was admitted in evidence.  Perhaps you could tell us which you prefer, the typewritten text or your handwritten text.  
A.	I would rather use the handwritten text, because when a text is typed, necessary (sic) you have typos. 
Q.	The handwritten text is P. 56 in evidence.  I did provide a copy in the bundle.  The copy is R1, but it's on a smaller page format than the document that was in -- admitted in evidence.  Perhaps simply giving the witness P. 56 would be the best solution.  
A.	I have it. 
Q.	Okay.  If you turn it a few pages in -- because the document that you have now, which is what I disclosed to the parties, has several repeated pages.  But if you turn in by three or four pages, you'll see that the entire diary is reproduced, two pages per sheet.  
A.	I have it. 
Q.	I'd like to begin by looking at the page that bears K number KA010403B.  The way that all of these pages are identified is really by a letter of the alphabet, because they all bear the same K number, but then after that K number, it follows a -- 
A.	I got it.
Q.	Okay.  I just say that for the clarity of the record, because I'll be referring to each page by an alphabet.  
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	So looking at the B page, your entry states -- this -- and reading in French, "Decisions made", and under item number 1 you have, in French, "Sent a note to the prime minister on the advancement of the implementation on his directives with respect to civil auto -- civilian autodéfense."  

My question to you is:  Did you eventually do that?  Did you submit anything to the prime minister about how the progress of the civil defence was going?  
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  Let me answer that question.  

But, Mr. President, I can see we are moving to a new chapter with -- compared to what we discussed yesterday, and without having sought -- without trying to destabilise the Prosecutor, I would like, with your leave -- clarify something.  Yesterday during lunch break the Prosecutor challenged me with respect to the answer I had given him on Lieutenant Ruzibiza's book.  And I had told him -- I indicated to him that Ruzibiza had written in that book that Kagame seemed against RPF soldiers, to go and assist soldiers -- militant -- active militants in the area controlled by government.  

The Prosecutor proposed to give me a copy of Ruzibiza's book so that I should show both to him and to the Chamber, Your Honour, the pages, the references -- the pages which I had referred to.
Q.	Mr. Karemera, let me interrupt you for one second.  Because my recollection of our exchange yesterday was that I asked you if you could find in Ruzibiza's book where the author says that there were clandestine brigades in Kibuye and RPF combatants in Kibuye, that you could point that out to us, and that doesn't seem to be what you are about to do now.  So my suggestion to you is to wait until your Defence attorney is re-examining you, and then you can address what you'd like to address at length.  But clearly, what you are about to go into is not -- doesn't have any relationship to my suggestion to you yesterday.  

So let's go back to your diary and to the question that I asked you just two minutes ago.  So, once again, I --
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I was talking to the President.  I wanted to know if the Trial Chamber would allow me to take up the challenge which you made to me, by providing those references.  And I'm going to give this indication -- see, I am not going to use up your times, but I don't want you to overlook those essential issues which are essential to me.  
You are going to ask me:  Did you set up the civil defence?  I promise you I will answer you.  But the civil defence was the result of the violence perpetrated by RPF combatants.  And I stated that RPF combatants, including Ruzibiza who was an RPF soldiers - soldier, complained that contrary to what their superior officers who were leading the RPF had -- he had promised and what he had said on Radio Muhabura to the RPF supporters in the enemy areas.  So -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, if I could interrupt one second.  Your Honour, would you kindly intervene and give us some direction at this point.  Should Mr. Karemera continue with his response, or should I ask my question?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Karemera, you've been following the way all the proceedings have been involved with.  And we want to control the duration of the examination.  So Mr. Webster is under some pressure at the moment.  Now, we all do think that you should have an opportunity to take up the challenge.  But we think you should do that, reserve your comments until the completion of his cross-examination.  And then we'll give you an opportunity at that stage to address this issue. 
THE WITNESS:
Okay, Your Honour.  Thank you. 

Mr. Prosecutor, I am now -- would you be so kind as to repeat the question?  But, in any case, what I understood was you were -- you wanted to know if -- it is not a suggestion.  Indeed it is a conclusion that -- that I had drawn after the meeting I held with some collaborators in the ministry of the interior is the meeting of 9 June 1994.  So the question you were asking is:  What is written in the first point was actually implemented?  Is that it?  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Yes, that's correct.  I want to know if you prepared a note or prepared a memo for the prime minister on the progress made in putting in place or implementing the directive on civil defence.  
A.	No.  It was not prepared, because we were in Bulinga.  Bulinga is spelt B-U-L-I-G-A (sic).  

When Bulinga on 9th June -- and on the 12th of June, Gitarama fell. 
Q.	Mr. Karemera, please.  I believe you've already answered the question.  I asked you if you prepared the note, and you said no.  So let me ask my next question, please.  
A.	Okay.  Please carry on. 
Q.	As a subset to number 1, you also indicated that, in substance, drawing the attention of the government to the impatience of the people who were relatively mobilised in order to confront the enemy -- but it was waiting for the support of the military.  So I'm asking you now:  Which population were you referring to when you made that notation? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, that memo was dated 9 June.  And I told you that my first priority was to convene a meeting of the préfets, and we discussed it on the 28 of May, from the 28 to the 5th -- 25 May 1994.  And in a meeting with the préfets and the prime minister and myself, we talked about how the préfets and their collaborators, bourgmestres, conseillers, were mobilising the population to -- for it not to carry on fleeing before the RPF advance.  And it is that population I'm referring to, that is, the 
	Rwandan people as a whole.  

So within that population we planned to organise, select and trained (sic) youth who were strong and valide in order to face up -- face the enemy.  And the population indeed answered positively to the prime minister's call, that while they were working they should work when, if necessary, they should lay down the hoe.  And if you need to react to any misattack (sic), that has to be done.  And that is the population I'm referring.  There's no other one.  It's the Rwandan population.  And when I'm saying that it was relatively mobilised, it's based on information that the préfets had provided to the prime minister and to myself during the meeting of the 28th.  

But I would like to specify forthwith that the people -- population had been called, because the RPF had its infiltrators everywhere.  We (sic) continued to perpetrate violence, and the people were of the opinion that the soldiers were not doing enough to protect it.  And that is why I stated that the population was not going to confront an enemy because they were not trained for that sort of thing, because the -- and the soldiers had to indicate what they were going to do to contain the enemy, especially the enemies that I'm talking about and the infiltrators who were found everywhere.  And that is what the army was expecting from the population in order to be able to understand -- to assist it.  That is how you should understand that.  
Q.	You also say -- there is also an entry -- I think it is the third bullet point down -- where you mention the recensement, which I assume is an accounting or an evaluation of -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Recensement is census. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Census -- sorry -- "Evaluation of youth that is mobilised for the civil defence should be made commune by commune under the supervision of préfets and brought to the attention of the secteur commander."

Wouldn't this entry tend to suggest that your civil defence programme was up and running and that, in fact, your entry in your diary on the 9th of June documents steps that you were taking to further the civil defence programme?  
A.	No, Mr. Prosecutor.  Maybe I'll go back to the answer that I gave to your previous question.  I had told you that it was a meeting with the -- some officers from the ministry of the interior whom I had been able to mobilise in order to associate them with my attempt to face up to the situation as it presented itself.  So you will then understand that it was not myself who was going to sit down and write down these notes.  And you will understand that the colleague whom I asked to prepare this note on the progress in the implementation of the directive was not going to do that from nowhere.  

So it was necessary -- well, because we didn't see that matters were going to speed up as they did.  The directive was signed on the 25th.  I signed on the 25th the measures for the implementation of that directive.  All of this was sent to the préfets with instructions for them to spread all this downward to the bourgmestres and the conseillers.  And I explained this with the table concerning what was supposed to be the operation of civil defence.  Once this information was spread down to the grass roots, the follow-up was to go and see how the directive was being implemented.  And it was necessary.  

Well, I wasn't going to wait for the government to call upon me on the matter to begin -- to prepare a response.  This is why the first meeting with the officers, I indicated in what direction they needed to write the notes so that I don't have any problems with the -- the colleagues to whom I gave the responsibility to go on the ground and to ensure what was being done.  

So please don't confuse the bullet with the result of the indication.  This is the information I was giving to the colleague so that he could write down the note.  And in my first answer to your question, I had said that the events speeded up and the officers dispersed, and we didn't have the time to implement the directive. 
Q.	If we go to point number 5 on the next page, which ends in the letter C, it says -- and I'm going to read in French, "Notes on the utilisation of 50 million Rwandan francs, which were released in order to be used for the -- leading the population for the implementation of the civil defence programme." 
A.	Yes.  I'm with you. 
Q.	I suggest to you that that entry indicates that the money was already made available in order to mobilise the population for civil defence.  Do you agree or not?  Or you can tell us how that money was used.  

In your memo of the 25th -- excuse me -- 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	-- in your instructions of the 25th of May, there is a whole list of things that can be -- that should be the subject of expenditures for the civil defence:  Buying weapons, paying for transportation, buying food and refreshments for the civil defence workers.  Was that how this money was used, the 
	50 million Rwandan francs that you indicate there?  
A.	Which workers?  You talked about workers.  Which workers?  
Q.	I was referring to your civil defence cadre or recruits or Interahamwe or however you wish to characterise them, those who were incorporated into the civil defence.  
A.	No.  No, Mr. Prosecutor.  Well, since you have what is written, please read what is written.  What you're referring to is the directive on the use of funds for the civil defence.  And this -- it's not the notes here.  So I think you're confusing the two.  

But, as for the amount, I'll explain what it was used for and how I spread it out.  And I'm going to clarify this for you so that no one is misled.  At the time the Rwandan franc was about 140 -- was about $1, $1 American.  It was about 140 francs for $1 at the time.  So it's around $300,000.  

So please don't use a false premise that Édouard Karemera received a certain amount from the government to organise the implementation of the civil defence throughout Rwanda and that this amount was sufficient for that operation -- $300,000 for the whole country, attacked from all sides.  

So we had, in fact, decided to ask, both at the préfecture and commune level as well as at the secteur level, for the leadership in the implementation of the prime minister's directive on civil defence.  But the means to be used was the responsibility of the national committee for civil defence of which I was chair.  

And the first matter that I put to the ministry -- ministerial meeting on the 10th of May was to find out with what means, what resources, the préfets were going to implement the directive.  And I made them understand, the members of government, that we cannot ask the préfets to organise operations that we were asking them to do without giving them the resources.  The government didn't have much money, but they were convinced by what I said.  And they said that we can always depend on the population because it's for its defence.  But I'm explaining -- 
Q.	Let me refine my question.  Was the money actually disbursed and used?  Just answer that question.  
A.	Yes.  That's what I was trying to tell you.  So the amount of 50 thou -- 50 million dollars (sic).  
Q.	Going on to the next page.  
A.	But it was used for what?  
Q.	Going on to the next page, page D at item 4.  
A.	Mr. President -- Mr. President, I don't understand.  The Prosecutor is asking me a question:  Was that amount used?  And since he wants to say that it was used to pay workers, he doesn't want me to say for what purpose this amount was used.  Is this fair?  No.  I don't think it is fair.  

Because he wants to draw conclusions which suit him after having prevented me to say for what purpose this 50 million francs was used for.  Now he wants to say how it was used.  But how was it used?  To pay workers, as he is putting it to me?  I am saying that that is not the case.  

And this is not what you have to make me say, even if you are in a hurry.  I have been in prison for 11 years.  So please do not disturb the discussions.  I am the one who is supposed to answer your question, so please tell me if I have nothing further to do here.  Ask me your questions, and I'll answer them.  But you should draw -- you should not draw conclusions that you wish that suit you, and this is not fair. 
Q.	Going on to the next question.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, we agree with Mr. Karemera.  We think he should be allowed to explain, because it's quite clear that you're going to be using this as a means of drawing inferences, when he can give direct testimony on the matter.  

Yes.  We have ruled. 
THE WITNESS:
May I respond?  Thank you, Mr. President.  

So I was saying that the 50 million Rwandans francs corresponded more or less to $300,000.  And in order to be able to convince the préfets that they were need -- they were to be involved in the implementation of the prime minister's directive and that they should commit the population to be involved in this task, it was necessary at least that the government provide the example.  It was the government which had taken the measure to launch this operation, and it was the government to give the example.  

And the example that I was asking the government to provide is at least to place at the disposal of the préfets a minimum amount to open an account for civil defence in each préfecture.  And one can only open an account with some money.  And the préfet could not take money from their own pockets and open that account for civil defence.  This is why this amount of 50 million francs was spread out between the 11 préfectures, depending on the number of communes that there were in each of the 11 préfectures and also dependent on -- with the -- we gave priority to the préfectures which were the most exposed to the front, to the war front, so that the implementation of the directive can be done as quickly as possible with the initial amounts.  

So this 50 million Rwandan francs was shared between the different préfectures, and the Prosecutor has our correspondence which was written to all the préfets, asking them to open accounts and telling them how they needed to manage those accounts and also indicating to them, by way of example, the operations that could be financed through these accounts.  

This is the supplement of my answer that I needed to give to the Prosecutor without taking too much of his time and also -- also to answer directly to the question.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Going on to the next page, ending in D, at item number 4, you mention a meeting of the political parties in Gisenyi on the 7th -- 
A.	One second, please.  I am -- I'm not with you.  

Yes.  It's not the following page.  It's the following column.  Yes.  I'm with you, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	There is reference to a meeting of political parties that took place in Gisenyi from the 6th to the 7th of June 1994.  My question to you is:  Who represented the MRND at that meeting? 
A.	But, Mr. Prosecutor, I am going to take you back.  I'm going to take you to the beginning of the note, page KA01403A (sic), the first meeting, meeting of the five political parties participating in the government from the 6th to the 7th of June.  And I myself represented the MRND, and the decisions that were taken can be found in that first column of the page that I have given to you just now. 
Q.	Was Mathieu Ngirumpatse or Joseph Nzirorera present? 
A.	They were on mission abroad.  Neither was there. 
Q.	Did you have an opportunity to discuss with either Mathieu Ngirumpatse or Joseph Nzirorera the progress of the civil defence in June of 1994? 
A.	No.  
Q.	This was not something that was discussed with them at any time during the month of June; is that your testimony? 
A.	No.  Why?  It was a matter for the government.  Did I have any business in it with the parties?  No.  We didn't discuss this at the party level. 
Q.	Did you have any discussion with Mathieu Ngirumpatse or Joseph Nzirorera about the problem -- the problems in Bisesero? 
A.	No; never. 
Q.	Let's move on to page ending in F.  
A.	Yes.  I'm with you. 
Q.	There is a number 4 at the top of the page, and it says in French "Appointment to the 
	ministry of the interior".  
A.	Yes.  I can see that.  I am with you, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Number 2 on that list is a reference to Juvénal Kajelijeli in Mukingo.  My question to you:  Was this -- was that the first time that Kajelijeli was being discussed at the cabinet level -- and this is for your meeting of the 17th of June -- or were there previous discussions? 
A.	Which meeting of the 7th of June?  Did the interpreter misinterpret you or not?  We were talk -- she said the 7th of June, but we were talking about the 17th. 
Q.	My question was with regard to the 17th of June, as is indicated on the previous page, the cabinet meeting of the 17th of June.  Was that the first time that Juvénal Kajelijeli was being discussed at the cabinet level as a replacement -- or as a -- to be appointed a bourgmestre in Mukingo? 
A.	But what do you mean to say?  Because I am the one who presented the matter on the 17th of June.  I had already been asked on the 10th to make that presentation, but on the 10th I had not proceeded with the necessary verification to ensure that the candidates I was going to name were going to be ready to assume that task.  So the first time that this matter was discussed, at least in my presence, was on the 17th.  And that was the first time that we mentioned Kajelijeli, unless you think that there was another meeting of the counsel of ministers which discussed this, but I was -- I wasn't there. 
Q.	Did you not attend the meeting on the 10th of June?
A.	But on the 10th of June, I was there.  But the matter was not on the agenda, because the prime minister had wanted to include it.  When he asked me the question, since I was the one who needed to present the matter, I said that I had just started my functions and I could not support the proposals that the directeur de cabinet had tried to bring about before my appointment and that the prime minister certainly was aware of this.  

And I said that I could not go and make a presentation before the council of ministers on something which I -- I'm not in full control of.  So he didn't put it on the agenda.  But in the meeting it was recalled in the AOB that the minister of the interior needed urgently to finalise a matter concerning the appointment of bourgmestres and present it during the next council of ministers, that is, on the 17th, and that is what I did. 
Q.	Didn't Augustin Ngirabatware, the minister of planning, participate in that discussion on the 10th of June?
A.	The 10th of May -- of June -- sorry -- 10th of June.  The 10th or the 17th?  
Q.	My question to you was:  Was Augustin Ngirabatware present during the coun -- the cabinet meeting on the 10th of June, and did he not discuss this issue, the appointment of Juvénal Kajelijeli in Mukingo? 
A.	No.  You are asking two questions.  Now, for the first question:  Did he attend the meeting of the 10th of June or not?  I cannot answer that question.  

You asked me the question already yesterday.  And do you think that I didn't remember the answer I gave you yesterday?  I am not trying to lie to you.  

I wasn't responsible for the attendance of ministers at the council meeting, and I don't have sufficient -- in my memory to recall whether he was there or not.  So I cannot tell you whether he was indeed there or not. 
Q.	Augustin Ngirabatware made an entry in his diary for the 10th of June for the cabinet meeting that took place and which included a discussion of whether or not Juvénal Kajelijeli should be reappointed bourgmestre of Mukingo.  Having said that, does that jog your memory? 
A.	No.  That doesn't remind me of anything, because Ngirabatware's diary is not mine.  I have my notes.  And fortunately, I was taking notes, because on the meeting of the 10th of June, on the previous page, I can read you what is written there. 
Q.	Mr. Karemera, I can read -- 
A.	At point 3, point 3 of the previous page which ends with the letter D, delta, the "wish to see the file on the nomination of bourgmestres and sous-préfets with the relevant information the following Friday."  And what I said, "Mr. Prime Minister, this item is not on the agenda.  I cannot defend it before I have made the verification."  This is what I said, and this is what is written on my diary.  

Now, if you have Ngirabatware's diary and you want to bring me also the diary of Nyiramasuhuko or Kambanda -- you know what I believe.  These are their diaries.  Ngirabatware is going to be here, and you will have the opportunity to question him.  So why do you want me to answer questions regarding Ngirabatware's diary?  And it is not my diary.  I don't know what's written in there.  All I know is what I wrote on my diary -- or, rather, my notes, because I didn't have the privilege of having a diary. 
Q.	Mr. Karemera, isn't it true that the préfet in Ruhengeri wanted to -- wanted to appoint Semahane as the bourgmestre from Mukingo and that instead of following through with his recommendation, the interim government appointed Kajelijeli? 
A.	First of all, Mr. Prosecutor, I wish to tell you that I do not know Semahane, and I didn't receive any report from the préfet, because the préfet did not -- does not have any will to express.  He made the proposals to the minister of the interior, and the decision is not on the minister of the interior.  He just verifies what he receives, and he forwards the proposals to whom it may concern.  

And I explained to the Chamber why the procedure was what it was at the time.  The préfet did not make any proposal to me concerning the man you are mentioning.  He sent me -- sent me a word, and he explained that, rightly so, he was able to bring together the communal development council for Mukingo commune.  And within that council meeting, people expressed their views in order to put forward the application of Kajelijeli.  And this is what he told me, and this is what I submitted for the government for discussion.  

Semahane, whom you mentioned, I don't know that person.  I don't remember that there was any 
report -- that there was any report presented to me by the préfet in the direction you are take -- you are saying.  At any rate, I didn't have any proposals regarding Semahane. 
Q.	But you do know Juvénal Kajelijeli, don't you? 
A.	Today I know him, but at the time I did not.  I knew him by name because he was bourgmestre previously.  But to tell you the truth, I had never met him.  Never.  The first time that I saw Kajelijeli was here at the UNDF.  When he was brought, he found me there.  

But he was already famous, because when Nzirorera was arrested, there was a mistake about Nzirorera, because Kajelijeli at the time had just come out of the UNHCR prison.  You are not saying that, Mr. Prosecutor.  

Kajelijeli had been imprisoned under the instigation of the High Commissioner for Refugees of the United Nations for several years in Kinshasa.  And when he came out of prison, when Kinshasa fell, he was picked up by his compatriot, Nzirorera, who is furthermore from the same commune at -- as himself.  He welcomed him well -- where he was in exile in Benin.  

And when Nzirorera was taken, his reputation was that he was a big man.  And so they took Kajelijeli instead of him, and this is something that you certainly know.  So he appeared before Judge Kama, and you recall what the Prosecutor said.  He was added on the list, Mr. Prosecutor, and this was beyond my control.  Kajelijeli's name was added to the list so that he appeared -- because we were arrested without any indictment, without any arrest warrant, and you had said, "Arrest the big man."  And when you took -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honours, the witness is speaking too fast for the interpreter.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Karemera, when you speak so fast -- 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
The interpreter -- no.  The point -- there is no point, because it's not interpreted.  And so it's not --
THE WITNESS:
I'm sorry.  The reason is that the Prosecutor is -- is behaving as if he doesn't know things he knows.  When Mr. Nzirorera was arrested, Kajelijeli had just been released from prison in Kinshasa, and he didn't leave prison because his file was complete.  The reason he was released was that Kinshasa was falling.  And when the city falls, people who are in prison disperse.  That is the same thing that happened to us in Kigali.  So he was picked up by Nzirorera, who, at the time, you know -- was probably his friend.  In any case, he was his compatriot, and they were the natives from the same commune as Nzirorera.  And he was in Benin.  

So when they came to arrest us -- because we were arrested from the court.  There was no warrant.  There was no indictment.  There were only Kambanda's statements.  I was arrested in Togo, Mathieu in Mali, and Nzirorera was arrested in Benin.  

When the people of the OTP, accompanied with Beninese police arrived to Nzirorera's, they thought that Kajelijeli was Nzirorera and that Nzirorera was Kajelijeli.  So they asked Kajelijeli what time to -- arrest him by saying that he was Nzirorera.  He protested but -- using -- but -- by all means.  But they did say in French, "Attachez le gros," meaning "Tie up the big one."  And they tied him up, and they put him in -- threw him in jail.  For one month we waited for us -- to be transferred from our various prisons, I in Togo, Nzirorera in Benin, Mathieu in Benin (sic).  

And on the 10th of July 1998, when they took us, starting with Mali, then Togo and Benin, to collect Nzirorera, I didn't know Kajelijeli had been arrested.  That is when I learned that Nzirorera had spent one month in prison with Kajelijeli and that Kajelijeli had not been taken away because the Tribunal had no justification for him to be brought.  We came here to UNDF.  We stayed there for one week -- wasn't the initial appearance.  But we were in this hall before President Kama, where we presented to the Judge, where we complained because we had been arrested without any warrant or indictment, and the Prosecutor knows it because he was already involved.  

President Kambanda (sic) stated that -- and this is on the 16th, you -- the President said, "You return in ten days, and if there's any indictment against you, I'm going to release you (sic)."  And we returned in ten days.  And the indictment was not there yet, but the president did not release us.  He granted the Prosecutor -- Prosecutor's plea that he had all UNDF archives to sort out before presenting the indictment.  Finally, on 29th of August 1998, we received the indictment -- 28th August.  And in that indictment --
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Karemera, if I could interrupt you for one second.    
MR. WEBSTER: 
And I'll direct my enquiry to the Chamber.

	Your Honour, is this the type of response that is being provoked by an argumentative question on my part? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Karemera, wait just a moment. 
THE WITNESS:
Okay.  Thanks.  Thank you.  I answered his question.  And I reminded him that Kajelijeli was not on an indictment.  He was added in handwriting, and that he knows. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Karemera, you are well aware that in 1993, Kajelijeli was the bourgmestre of Mukingo and he was removed after an investigation and at the insistence of all of the parties that were negotiating the Arusha Accords, because he was a notorious killer, an abuser of human rights.  He was removed from office in 1993; isn't that true? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, allow me to tell you that it was at the request of the RPF that he was dismissed and that the RPF was supported by the MDR, the PSD, the PL, which had, on 3rd June 1992, arrived at a cooperation agreement to topple Habyarimana and his clique. 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)...the coalition between the RPF and the opposition.  My question was quite simple and quite direct.  You know, do you not, that Kajelijeli was removed --
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Your Honour -- Mr. President, excuse me.
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour -- 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. Karemera, one minute.

Mr. President, I think there's some concern.  The Prosecutor asked him:  Do you know that Mr. Kajelijeli was dismissed because he was a killer?  By showing him a document in which it states that Mr. Karemanda (sic) proposed Mr. Kajelijeli as bourgmestre during the cabinet meeting of the 17th.  

You should not insult our intelligence, Mr. President, and Mr. Karemera, because those suggestive questions are understandable to Mr. Karemera.  And I congratulate him for that.  

And he's explaining to the Chamber that Mr. -- no.  Mr. Kajelijeli was not dismissed because he was a killer.  He was dismissed because the RPF so requested.  And he is giving him the background, because he seems not to understand the background to Kajelijeli.  

If you don't allow him to give those -- such answers, well, then let him withdraw his question.  I mean --but you understand.  

I mean, we're not animals.  We are intelligent people.  So they should let him answer.  And he should be allowed to explain why Mr. Kajelijeli was dismissed and why he was able to present him during this meeting -- cabinet meeting of the 17th, because that is where -- that's the crux of the matter.  It isn't anything else. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Does the Chamber want to rule on Ms. Dior Diagne's baseless objection?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We think that it was not necessary for Ms. Diagne to intervene.  But we think Mr. Karemera should be allowed to give an explanation. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

So the Prosecutor was putting it to me that Mr. Kajelijeli had been dismissed in 1993 because all the parties that were negotiating in Arusha had so requested.  And I was answering.  I don't know why he doesn't want me to answer completely.  I was saying that indeed the parties that were negotiating in Arusha were the RPF and the RPF had reached an agreement with the FDC.  And the FDC, as the -- as (inaudible) was made up of the MDR, the PL, and the PSD.  

They had reached an agreement or an accord with -- through a communiqué of the 3rd of June 1992.  In that communiqué it is stated that they would do everything to topple Habyarimana.  And the first thing that Kanyarengwe, who was the president of RPF, knew to destabilise Habyarimana was to -- to dismiss the efficient bourgmestres that were liked by the population and the civil servants.  

So here in Arusha we were sent with the complicity of the head of the Rwandan delegation -- who unfortunately died, and I pay respects to him.  We went to the same school, Christ-Roi -- Boniface, and we both worked at the presidency.  And when he led a -- the Rwandan delegation to those negotiations, he became the accomplice to the RPF, following an arrangement which had been arrived in Brussels.  And that is how officers of the army and the bourgmestres and préfets had to be dismissed for the negotiations to carry on.  

And the government, which was led by the MDR under Dismas Nsengiyaremye, set up an evaluation commission for civil servants, which asked the dismissal of people on -- led by the RPF.  Many people were listed on it, and I can actually quote -- cite names to state that I know them.  They were not dismissed because they were killers, but it is because that is what the RPF was asking in order to carry on negotiations.  And since they were -- they had the complicity of the leader of the -- of the 
Rwandan delegation, this happened.  All these people were dismissed for nothing. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Wasn't there an international commission that investigated human rights abuses in Rwanda in January of 1993? 
A.	Pardon me?  I didn't understand the question you were asking.  The commission?  What commission are you referring to?  
Q.	My question to you:  Was there not an international commission of various human rights organisations, including human rights organisations in Rwanda and Human Rights Watch, Africa Watch, FIDH, at least four or five different human rights organisations that put together a consortium and came to investigate human rights abuses in Rwanda in January of 1993? 
A.	But the commission was an invention, indeed an instigation of your late witness Alison Des Forges.  They stayed in Rwanda for 15 days.  They concluded there had been a genocide.  They stayed in the areas controlled by the R -- AFR (sic) for about two hours, and they found that the RPF had done nothing.  I mean, we all know that, both you and I.  So carry on with questions on that report.  But you'd have to give me -- give it to me so that I would also indicate to you what we did with it.  The draft was already referring to genocide.  
Q.	Your -- 
A.	Mama genocide. 
Q.	I'm sorry?  
A.	No.  That's all. 
Q.	The report --
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	-- referred to killings of the Bagogwe in Ruhengeri, killings of Tutsi in the Bugesera in 1992, killings in Kibilira, and --
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	-- and specifically addressed the accusations that were made against Juvénal Kajelijeli in Mukingo.  So clearly, you're well aware of the reputation that Kajelijeli had in 1993.  
A.	Do you know that report was not adopted?  This report, the draft report, was submitted to the Rwandan government and the president, Habyarimana, alongside Premier Nsengiyaremye -- jointly signed a letter denying a lot of things that were contained in that report.  And for having signed, Mr. Prosecutor, alongside Habyarimana, that document which -- denied many things in that report.  

Nsengiyaremye lost the trust of the RPF.  And that is when *******************took centre stage.  And that is why, Mr. Prosecutor, that Nsengiyaremye raced against the clock -- that was in 1993 -- to complete the negotiations here in Arusha.  And he had to cheat in order to become prime minister in the broad-based government.  But unfortunately for him, he fell into the trap.  Because the parties which had delegated Ngulinzira (sic) to negotiate here reminded them, the MDR leading -- because Nsengiyaremye was only vice-president.  The vice -- the president was**********************************.  

Rugenzi (sic) was the PL president and was still together.  And they were in the democratic forces for change.  And in the PSD Nzambonamoye (sic) was a notorious FPL (sic), and the RPF alerted his associates in Rwanda that the minister of foreign affairs, under Dr. Dismas Nsengiyaremye -- that Ngulinzira had -- betraying -- were overtaking them, because he had come with Nsengiyaremye's candidacy -- and that he was ready to cede to the RPF and the minister of the interior on condition of the addition of Nsengiyaremye's name into the agreement as prime minister for the broad-based government.  And that is how the name of the person who was to be prime minister was added in the protocol agreement.  

But he was caught up by his lies.  And since the RPF preferred***************************, the -- it broke up -- the MDR broke up into factions.  You don't know these things, and I have to tell you.  And the basis of which is that report, which we don't want to give in -- but parts of which I know and which was rejected by government and which -- you -- and you know there was a joint letter signed, both by Habyarimana and Nsengiyaremye, denouncing the methods used by Des Forges.  Off the cuff, let me cite Canadians, Carbonare, Kagame's current adviser, who has always been his adviser for a long time.  
You had Gilles, I believe -- Counsel Gilles -- you have the list.  I mean, you can give me that list.  I will explain that to you clearly.  

So, Mr. Prosecutor, the findings of that report were l'avant-goût of the genocide which you are defending, and I understand that you would like to refer to the source, the origin.  But at the time it had not been accepted, and the reporters had had to fall back on the United Nations 
Human Rights Commission.  And I'll remember the name of the person who was sent to Rwanda later on.  He was sent to Rwanda.  But somebody was sent to fill the gaps, because the report had been rejected. 
Q.	Mr. Karemera, you sound like you're very familiar with the report.  I assume that you read it when it was issued back in early 1993.  
A.	I -- I -- I don't seem to be.  I know it.  I'm talking about things I know.  I don't seem to be.  I'm telling you about things I know.  I am not fabricating anything.  If you -- I had a time -- if you had the time, I could give you the details of those things which you are trying to defend with false arguments.  I'm telling 
	you -- talking to you about something I know, because that is what destroyed my country, and that is what destroyed me.
MR. WEBSTER:
For the Court and the parties, the document that we're referring to was circulated in the bundle as document number 10G.  It's also already identified in our record with an IP number.  I don't recall it offhand.  And it's entitled "The report of the international commission of investigation on human rights violations in Rwanda since the 1st of October 1990."  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And, Mr. Karemera, at page 3 of that report, it states in the middle of the page, "The commission concluded" -- 
A.	And I don't have the document.  I don't have the document.  I cannot -- I don't have the right to have the document?  

Because I know the way you read.  You read what you want, and you set aside what does not suit you.  I want to be able to follow what you are saying since you have it.
MR. WEBSTER:
The document is identified in our record as IP4.  It's in English.  

I have no objection to the registry providing Mr. Karemera with a copy, and I'll continue.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	In the middle of page 3, it states, "The commission concluded that both the government of Rwanda and the RPF had been guilty of human rights abuses."  So your claims that the report is biased, at least in that respect, don't seem to be quite correct.  But "Among other findings" -- and this is the report that I'm reading, "Among other findings, it determined that" -- and then there are several bullet points.  And among those bullet points, it states, "The Rwandan government has killed or caused to be killed about 2,000 of its citizens."  And this is back in January of 1993.  January to March of 1993 is when the report was drafted -- when the investigation took place.  Excuse me.

"The majority of the victims have been members of the minority group, the Tutsi, and they have been killed and otherwise abused for the sole reason that they are Tutsi.  Authorities at the highest level, including the president of the republic, have consented to abuses."  It goes on.  Further down on 
page 4:  "The Rwandan army killed civilians during attacks on the Bagogwe and in Bugesera.  It slaughtered hundreds of others in the course of a military operation in Mutara."  

There are many other allegations. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, would Mr. Webster be so kind as to read more slowly.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, would the -- would the Prosecutor be so kind as to tell us where we can have the references to the documents. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
As I stated earlier, it is document number 10G, which is in the second binder of documents that I distributed yesterday or the day before.  It's also a document that we've all looked at before, since there have been previous discussions with other witnesses with the document.  But I'm not going to go into detail.  

Mr. Karemera has been helpful insofar as he's told us that he is familiar with the document.  So I'll go on to my next question. 
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, Mr. President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, as you know, you are not a witness, so what you have said is not really so important at this stage.  

You read something.  And Mr. Karemera hasn't said anything about it. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Mr. Kare -- I can't imagine that Mr. Karemera is not going to say something in response, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I know.  But you said you're going to move on to your next question.  I think that's what he was trying to find out.  
Was -- was there a question attached to your read -- your reading or not?  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Karemera, would you like to respond to what I just read into the record?
A.	No, Mr. Prosecutor.  Firstly, let -- allow me to answer -- what you did not say.  I told you that I don't have the document.  And while we were trying to get the document to me, you read.  I didn't follow you.  I didn't follow you.  

And now the document has been given to me, and you are telling me that you are going to the next question.  That is what shocked me.  Now that I have been -- just been given the document, please, first of all, tell me what part of that document you are referring to and what you would like -- to read it, since it is in English, and allow the interpreters to interpret what you are reading for me.  And then I would comment, as required.  

Otherwise, I don't quite understand how you could feel that you can progress in the manner in which you are -- as a matter of fact, you -- we are going around in circles.  You are not progressing.  

And I'm saying this without any viciousness.  I mean, you are running against time.  I have been waiting for you for 11 years.  Do you realise that?  

Now you are running against time.  You are reading things you don't even allow me the time to put in a word, and then you're going to draw your conclusions.  And fortunately, the Judges are -- are professionals, and they have written that in many of their answers to my requests.  And I trust this Court.  

Now, if you distort this -- this is the basis of the hypothesis, your (inaudible).  And I'd like to discuss it.  But it is in English.  Allow me the time as -- for the things that you are saying to be interpreted to me so that I can answer you.  

I am no longer in a hurry.  I am ready to discuss with you step by step on any aspect that you are putting against me.  But you need to give me the chance to answer you and not to run, because you're escaping the discussion, and that is not fair. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I won't take too much time.  Quite simply, I would like to state to the Court that, to my understanding, we are -- are at the core of this trial with this document.  And since the evidence is being presented by the Accused, you have to give time for this to be disclosed, because it has been the onset of all the incriminations that motivated the indictment of this -- of this -- of this -- of the OTP.  Everything started from this document, and this is a golden opportunity today to discuss it.  
And the witness who is there -- and he is the one who is providing evidence -- has to be given a chance to explore this document right to the marrow, because you have to clear all ambiguities in this document, and we all should be able to look at all the ambiguities in the hypothesis of the -- of the Prosecutor.  That is my conviction, Mr. President. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, to support what Counsel Nimy has just said, this is a 57-page document.  And as Mr. Webster has made us -- has done in the past, he is going to try to have one, two, or three page -- paragraphs to be commented.  And these paragraphs are specially selected in view of distorting everything else, which is exactly what happened yesterday.  It is what happened yesterday with 
	Sindiku -- President Sindikubwabo's speech, where he read three extracts, three paragraphs, and then kept the rest aside.  

And my fear here is that we are going to see the same falsification of the entire document by selective reading of extracts, which will not allow Mr. Karemera the chance to fully comment this document after having read it in whole.  You cannot have this document to be commented by extract when it is useful only as a whole.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Rather than commenting on whether the interventions are necessary, I think we'll simply rule that it's time for our mid-morning recess.  So we'll take a short break now.
(Court recessed at 1030H) 
(Pages 1 to 22 by Tanya West)

















(Court resumed at 1105H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
In light of the exchanges just before we took our mid-morning recess, we have thought that it might be reasonable to reconsider our time schedules and allow you the remainder of the day for cross-examination, Mr. Webster.  And Ms. Diagne, tomorrow morning we will allow approximately 
one hour for redirect, if you would require it.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, have you changed your decision?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  What I was saying was that in light of the -- we took special note of the comments made just before our adjournment, and particularly in relation to Mr. Karemera's request, that we give him full opportunities for responding to issues which he thought were relevant.  And we thought that in the light of that we should not appear to be rushing him to give his answers.  That's basically the motive of our adjustment. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, I consider that you have reconsidered your decision without any additional request from the Prosecutor and without any chance for me to counter that.  So it seems you came back from the break with a gift for the Prosecutor.  Further, you have informed me that you are giving me one hour.  
Thank you, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, if that really was intended to start a discussion -- because you had not, in fact, made any proper assessment as yet.  And we started the discussion of the topic because we thought that the redirect will take place tomorrow.  And that was really a matter of a definitive.  It wasn't intended to be a definitive order, but we are starting the discussion by suggesting that if you needed any time for redirect, we suggested one hour, but it wasn't intended really -- that wasn't intended to -- really to introduce the topic rather than to deliver a different order.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Well, Mr. President, before -- if I understand, you grant me leave because, as a matter of fact, earlier, I did not dare. I thank you for granting me leave to do so.  I, therefore, contest that decision, since you had given additional time to the Prosecutor, especially on the basis of length or, in any case, size of his questions.  That is to say, Mr. President, what has always prevailed in this Chamber is mastery of time on the cross-examination.  When the Prosecution puts -- makes suggestions -- 15-sentence suggestions to the witness and he expects a comment, that doesn't concern the witness.  And you would understand the witness that it is because he has been limited in time.  And it's not fair.  It is necessary for the Prosecutor to master his time.  We don't have to teach him this.  

The method that he is using is not right.  I don't believe that it was not incumbent upon you.  It was not your duty.  He took that route.  It has been applied up until now.  And what I asked you, Mr. President, was to apply to the letter because it is a witness who is a witness who is almost special, because it is the Accused.  

And when the Prosecutor causes problems each time, as he has been doing without getting to the crux of the matter, then he just have to state that there's no file and then he ends his cross-examination.  But to grant him leave, as you have just done, to add to his cross by several hours, I don't believe it's a good decision, if I can be allowed to express myself that way, because, as you understand, you are not the person whom I am complaining about it.  It's actually the decision which I believe is unfair with respect to my client.  

I, therefore, apply to you, Mr. President, that you should apply your order to the letter in this Court, especially with respect to this witness, who has been accused for very long and who has suffered for very long and who is undergoing an abnormal reason.  All of this has to be taken into account, 
Mr. President.  That is why I would apply for you not to revert the order you had already taken, especially since this request has not made the Prosecution to take note of it, the Defence as well.  I can't see what is it that made you make change, because maybe we shall start keeping you in the court, because every time you take a break you come with decisions which at times, I must say, are quite -- maybe not exaggerated, but I would like you to stick to your positions because there's no justification for you to change it, as nobody had asked you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't think it's true that nobody asked.  As I mentioned to you, they were influenced to some extent by the remarks of Mr. Karemera himself.  And we thought that was an element to increase the facilities and time for the presentation of his defence.  

Mr. Webster, you may continue.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	Mr. Karemera, I assume you've had an opportunity to read through the document, because I saw you seriously going through some papers during the break.  Is that the case? 
A.  	Yes.  That's okay.
Q.	I would like us to turn briefly to page 19.  It bears at the top K number K0020204.  
A.  	No.  That's not how it is going to be.  A while ago, I told you they had just given me the document, and you had drawn a conclusion while the document was being handed to me.  And when we took our break, I am very pleased with the order of the Court, after the -- when we took the break, the intention was for me to react, and I am going to react now.  I will react now, and then you can ask me the 
	next question. 
Q.	I am going to ask you a question, and then when I've completed my question, you can take that opportunity to respond to the passage that we read and anything else in the document that you care to address.  I am directing our attention to page 19 in the English text. 
A.	Okay.  That's okay.
Q.	There are two paragraphs in the middle of the page.  I'm going to read both of them.  The 
	first paragraph that I will read starts with the words, "The RPF took Ruhengeri".  Mr. Karemera, you let me know when you find the page and I'll begin. 
A. 	A minute please.  Okay.  I am with you now.  You said in the middle.  Okay.  I can see.  Now I am with you. 
Q.	"The RPF took Ruhengeri, the most important city in the northwest, in late January 1991.  They held it only for a few hours, but during that time they managed to free all prisoners from jail.  Their success, though short-lived, was a shock to Rwandan authorities, who sought to react to it by accusing local Bagogwe and Tutsi of helping the RPF. 

	"In Mukingo Bourgmestre Juvénal Kajelijeli sent communal police and forest guards, usually retired soldiers armed with guns who protect the forests and national parks, to collect local Bagogwe in the communal pickup truck together with teachers and a director of a local school a communal conseiller, and other ordinary citizens.  They then killed the Bagogwe with stones, spears, sticks and guns."

Continuing to the next paragraph.  "Three Bagogwe women, accompanied by their children, who tried to reach the communal offices to enquire about the fate of their male relatives, were stopped at the barrier of Agasagara secteur where authorities stripped, beat and raped them in front of their children.  Later, the women and children took refuge with a congregation of nuns at Busogo.  When they were able to return home, they found their houses destroyed and their goods pillaged."

Now, my question to you, Mr. Karemera, is, were you aware of these facts in 1994 when you decided to reappoint Juvénal Kajelijeli as bourgmestre of Mukingo when he had been relieved of those duties because of accusations of this nature?
A.	Let me answer you, Prosecutor.  I would answer you, and it is going to be the end of my answer, because I am going to react on this document firstly -- firstly, because I contest the fact that you tried to introduce it for no reason into my trial, and I will try to state it as clearly as possible and as brief a manner as possible and in the most concise manner.  

	Let me start from the beginning.  The cover page, you see the associations that comprise -- which are supposed to have ordered this report.  But I would like to explain to the Trial Chamber, as this is something I knew, that these associations were -- or had approached the Rwandan government, especially the International Human Rights Federation, FIDH.  And the Rwandan government had agreed that, indeed, a commission of enquiry should come, but at the investigation of the 
	Rwandan government to carry out the investigations.  But what happened, Mr. Prosecutor, is that in spite of that government decision, the minister of justice at the time, Mr. Stanislas Mbonampeka -- let me spell, M-B-O-N-A-M-P-E-K-A, Mbonampeka, Stanislas, who was the minister of justice, which was in the government which was set up on the 16th of April 1992 under Dr. Dismas Nsengiyaremye.  Nsengiyaremye, I have spelt that several times, but let me spell it again.  Spelling, N-S-E-N-G-I-Y-A-R-E-M-Y-E.  Dr. Nsengiyaremye.  

	So the minister of justice was a member of PL, and the minister of justice was a member of the CLADHO association.  He was -- prior to being appointed minister of justice, he was member of CLADHO.  He was a lawyer.  And instead of dealing with these issues through this association, through the FIDH, he preferred to have his association do it.  I refer you to page K0020198.  At the bottom of the page, you have K0020188.  At the bottom of the page, "Rwandan association for rights of the person and public liberty, the association of volunteers for peace, the Christian league for defence of human rights in Rwanda", LICHREDHOR.  "You have the associations that comprised CLADHO and the minister of justice had been the chair of that group, such as the democratic forces for change.  These democratic forces for change had urgently set up associations that were said to be human rights defence associations but which, indeed, were political associations supporting the opposition against the Habyarimana regime, which denounced human rights violations but which also denounced development actions which President Habyarimana had succeeded through the organisation of Umuganda and so on and so forth.  

	So Mbonampeka desisted for CLADHO, and at the time the chairman of CLADHO who had replaced Mbonampeka was Mr. Nkubito, Alphonse.  Spelling of Nkubito, M-K-U-B-I-T-O (sic).
	Alphonse Marie, Nkubito.  He was the chairman of CLADHO, and he was the prosecutor general of Kigali.  Mr. Mbonampeka designated Nkubito as a correspondent for the people who were going to investigate in Rwanda, which is not a bad thing.  But it would turn out to be critical.  And I will get to that without losing much time.  

Now, let me talk to you about the composition of the commission.  We are on page K0020 -- K0020188.  And, Mr. Prosecutor, the middle of the page -- I wouldn't read in English -- Jean Carbonare from the association known as together for human rights, Paris.  You have Philippe Dahinden.  You have Mr. Degni, René, Segui.  You also have the late Alison Des Forges.  I know her home.  I have been right to her house, at her invitation.  

	You have Paul Dodinval; Éric Gillet, International Federation of Human Rights, member of the 
	Bar of Brussels.  You have Rein Odink, jurist, Amsterdam.  And you have Halidou Ouedraogo, 
	President of the Inter-African Union of Human Rights.  Ouedraogo.  And he was the judge of the administrative chamber supreme court of Burkina Faso.  Andé Paradis, director general of the 
	league of rights and liberties, Montreal.  Vous avez William Schabas, professor of law, 
	University of Quebec at Montreal, member of the Bar of Montreal.  

	Why did I read this list in its entirety to you?  To state to you that, Mr. Prosecutor, Jean Carbonare, after the victory of the RPF and even before -- and it is a noted fact -- he was President Kagame's adviser.  Philippe Dahinden set up Radio Gatasha, and he was your witness in the Media trial, and you know what he said about Ferdinand Nahimana and Jean Bosco Barayagwiza.  He was, and still certainly, in your camp.  

	René Degni-Segui from Côte d'lvoire, he is the one who submitted the report on the basis of which this Tribunal was set up.  Alison Des Forges, we, the prisoners, used to call her Mama Genocide.  And I believe that ever since she died -- and this is unfortunately for human nature -- many people say the same thing as us.  But while she was alive, people appreciated her action, except the victims of her lies.  

	Éric Gillet, you know him.  I am not going to say too much about him.  I will keep those.  

	William Schabas is French.  He has an association to defend the survivor -- the genocide survivors.  You know him.  He is a Frenchman, and he is very active in arresting Rwandans who had sought refuge in France.  

So when I was telling you that you cannot overlook this report, I believe this is the very foundation of your hypothesis.  And I am surprised that you waited till the end of my testimony to submit -- I mean, I don't know how to describe it, to submit it and maybe to ask the Chamber to admit it while nobody knows what it really implies.  

I carry on.  The commission came to Rwanda.  I was in Rwanda.  I was not in exile yet.  I was no 
	longer in government, but I was following on what was going on in the country.  He stayed for 
	15 days -- maybe 20 on the outside, no more -- 15, Mr. Prosecutor -- 15 days to conclude this draft -- because this is not a draft -- to conclude in that draft that there was genocide in Rwanda.  This was in 1993.  

	During those 15 days the commission acknowledges it, and I will read it very quickly, you know, the United Nations document.  Before going into detail, they have a synthesis, because they know that people are intellectually lazy and they are not going to read the entire document.  And so there's usually a summary, which I can also make, and there's a summary.  I am sure you read it.  I am not going to read it once again, but what I am going to tell you is found on page K0020190.  

	At the bottom of the page, footnote 3.  "Given the limitations, the commission was able to examine only some of the human rights violations charged against the Rwandan government and the RPF.  It was unable to investigate conditions in prisons outside Kigali, the conduct of trials and harassment of the press or questions which have been raised in previous human rights reports on Rwanda, nor was it able to travel to Uganda to interview displaced persons who might have provided additional testimony on abuse by the RPF.  But it remained for two years in the RPF zone.  That -- she stayed in the RPF zone for two years, and she says, I am going to get there."  She stayed two years -- two hours; I beg your pardon, two hours.  And this is at page K0020195.  

	And at second last paragraph:  "The commission travelled and conducted its interviews with official escort -- without -- without official escort except in the following circumstances:  A military escort, provided by the minister of defence, accompanied the commission on days when it was excavating the sites of mass graves; a policeman escorted several members to the commune of Kanzenze when they interviewed the local bourgmestre, mayor; and officers of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, RPF, accompanied the commission during its walk in zones which they control."  And I testify that the document doesn't specify that they remained in the zones controlled by the RPF at the time for 
	two hours.  But I am saying that it was two hours.  It was not one day, it wasn't half a day, but it was 
	two hours.  And they came to those conclusions.  

	And in that tour, the two-hour tour of the RPF controlled zone, they were not accompanied by 
	soldiers -- by policemen but by soldiers.  

Let me continue.  "Their draft" -- because this is how international organisations function.  Before I became a prisoner, I would read all these documents.  When there's a commission that is established, the first thing that it does is, of course, to carry out investigations.  And when those are concluded, 
	they write a report.  And if there are investigations concerning the government of sovereign 
	countries -- but I am going to conclude.  I am about to finish, Mr. Prosecutor.  Please, can you just be patient for two more minutes.  

	So they wrote the draft before they published the final report.  This report is submitted to the 
	Rwandan government so that it can make its assessment.  And that's diplomatic courtesy.  And the appreciation of the government is here.  

	I do not want to read it, but I am going to give you the reference to it, statement -- statement of the Rwandan government regarding the final report of the international commission of enquiry on 
	human rights violations in Rwanda since October 1, 1990 -- 1994.  But as you can see in the document, I am going to go speak under the control of the presiding Judge.  The document was signed on the 
	7th of April 1993 by the president of the republic, Habyarimana, Juvénal, who was a general major.  And it was signed by the prime minister, Dr. Dismas Nsengiyaremye.  

Mr. President, if the registry can kindly show you this document.  I am not seeing it for the first time, but it is signed.  

In order to gain time, Mr. President, I am not going to dwell on the content.  "The Rwandan government" -- let me summarise in two words. "The Rwandan government did not say that everything the commission wrote in its report was false or wrong, because the Rwandan government was not composed of saints.  But Rwanda was a country which was exceptionally keen on human rights.  There were human rights violations in Rwanda, just as there is everywhere, like the United States, the country of the Prosecutor.  And this can be testified to, given the problems that President Obama is having with Dick Cheney.  Guantanamo, one is for the other, and the other is against, and both are Americans.  

	So in Rwanda also the situation was not necessarily of unanimity.  There were violations of 
	human rights due to the arbitrary actions.  There were violations of human rights also due to the poverty of the country.  There were violations because of its political weakness.  And even when we were there, there are accusations which have been made in these documents -- allegations which have been made in this document which have not been verified, and they are serious allegations.  And this is why the government through its executive, the president of the republic and head of government, contested quite a number of things in some secteurs and they even asked for assistance in order to improve on the situation.  

Let me continue, and I will conclude on that note.  The commission, having received the observations made by the Rwandan government, withdrew, Mr. Prosecutor -- withdrew from its draft conclusions 
	which dealt with genocide because they had already taken judicial notice.  But we didn't know that judicial notice existed in Rwanda because we deal with common law.  But they had already noticed this.  And when the government observed to the commission that in its conclusions -- or it had gone quickly to the task by condemning the state -- because it was not Kajelijeli that the commission condemned.  It was the president, the prime minister.  So the commission took the document and removed what seemed to be inacceptable (sic) to the government, and it was brave enough to sign -- to put what it had included in the initial report.  

	Because in the United Nations circles, in all circles of friends, one helps one another.  In the organisations of human rights, there is self-help.  People help one another.  So Alison Des Forges, René Degni-Segui, Éric Gillet, William Schabas and -- I was going to say they plotted.  And their accomplices, Mr. Prosecutor, is known as Bakre Ndiaye.  Bakre Ndiaye, at the time, I don't know whether he was secretary general or president.  At any rate he was the rapporteur of the 
	human rights commission of the United Nations in Geneva.  

	And I think a month or three months later, because he finally joined in the middle of June 1993, he landed in Kigali in a beautiful Senegalese outfit, attire.  He arrived at the Hôtel des Mille Colline.  He remained there for 15 days with the beautiful Rwandan girls, and then he took in his turn the draft which had been prepared by Alison Des Forges, as the head of the group, Éric Gillet, René Degni-Segui.  

	And let me specify that at the time when he was -- when she was in Kigali, Alison -- when 
	he was in Kigali, Alison Des Forges was in Kigali.  She was working with the liberal party with 
	Madam Agnès Ntamabyariro.  I am saying this without any deviation because, before that, we had made a trip to the United States with Agnes Ntamabyariro for the PL, ************************for MDR, 
	Émile Nyungura to PSD, Nayinzira Jean-Népomuscène for the PDC, and Counsel Édouard Karemera.  At the time I was secretary -- I was national secretary of the MRND.  

	So we had a two-month trip at the invitation of the ambassador of the USA to Kigali.  And the representative of the ambassador in the US was Alison Des Forges.  There were 15 states, and we spent time in the home of Alison Des Forges in New York State at Buffalo.  We even stayed at her home because she said, "I am Rwandan like yourself, and I know that in Rwanda, when they visit one another, they speak about themselves and they spend time at home."  It's something that I understood because I had been warned beforehand.  It was in order to have her report discussed at length with her.  So we stayed for three days at her home.  

	I understood, Mr. Prosecutor, that Bakre Ndiaye - 
Q.	Mr. Karemera -- 
A.	I am finishing.
Q.	It has gotten to the point where I cannot take it anymore.  Now, I assume that the Court finds what you are saying very interesting and useful because you have been speaking since 11:16 and it is now 11:51.  So well over half an hour with one response that has not addressed the question that I asked.  And in the past I have tried to orient you and to exercise some discipline in the way that we relate to each other, and the Court seems to suggest that you should be given a free reign to say whatever you like.  

	But I asked you one question.  The question I asked you was whether you were aware of the 
	human rights abuses that Kajelijeli was alleged to have committed in 1993, and you have spoken for 
	36 minutes and you haven't said one thing in response to my question. 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, let's not get all worked up.  You asked the question, and you referred to page 19.  I haven't reached page 19 yet.  And I am going to answer your question.  And I am methodical.  You cannot orient me.  You cannot direct me.  It's not your role.  You can ask me questions, and I can answer them, but don't orient me. 
Q.	The question is:  Did you know of those allegations when they were made back in 1993?  Just answer that question and I will go on to something else. 
A.	No, I am going to answer you, Mr. Prosecutor.  The theory that -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I appeal to the Court for some direction on this point.  Should Mr. Karemera continue for another 36 minutes to complete his answer, or should the Court intervene to direct him to simply answer the question directly?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, the way you had originally put the question, it cannot be answered yes or no.  We agree that Mr. Karemera has been going on too long.  

Could you kindly abbreviate your answers.  

But he has to give an explanation in view of what you've said. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, there's no dispute that the witness should be allowed to give an expansive answer.  But my experience in this trial is that an expansive answer is around three or four minutes.  It's not 
	36 minutes, and that's how long we have spent on this one response.  So I appreciate the Court's concern to give the witness ample opportunity to be responsive, but there are also time limitations that I am operating within.  So having said that, I think Mr. Karemera understands my position.  I understand his.  And if I could please request the Court to direct Mr. Karemera to come to the point of his answer, and we will go on to another line of questioning. 
THE WITNESS:
But I am going to answer, Mr. President.  Please don't get too tired, Mr. Prosecutor.  But I want to send you to the title, because the paragraph that you read on page 19 is -- and please allow me to go there quickly to tell you because I do read documents myself, and then I talk about them.  

On page 17, at the top of the page, you have "The tragedy of the Bagogwe".  That is the title, "The tragedy of the Bagogwe".  And, Mr. Prosecutor, you know about the tragedy of the Bagogwe because that is your theory.  It is not an isolated case in the theory that you presented when you drew up the indictment against Karemera initially.  You know this.  You had indicated in your indictment that the repetition of the genocide -- the evidence for the repetition of the genocide were the massacres in Kibilira in October 1990; the massacres in Bugesera in February, March, 1992; the violence that took place in Kibuye in August 1992; and the massacres of the Bagogwe in Gisenyi, Ruhengeri in 
March 1991.  That was your theory.  

Now you're no longer talking about the repetition of the genocide, and you want to prove this without bringing out the evidence.  And you have disregard -- introduce this document which is the basis of your theory.  You have produced this document, and you don't have a complete mastery of it because -- but Alison Des Forges does, because she was the one who wrote it.  

In the Military I trial, opposite Mr. Degli, who was counsel for Kabiligi -- and he was 
secretary general, FIDH when Alison Des Forges spoke about her book, No witness should be --
Leave None to Tell the Story, because in the interim the Tribunal was established, and this is what she wanted to use in order to have the Hutus condemned.  And she introduced this report, and she found on her way Mr. Degli, Counsel Degli.  And you know what happened to the President of the Chamber, 
the presiding Judge, Mr. Williams.  He resigned, Mr. Prosecutor.  We are intelligent.  We do not know the secrets of God, but we do not know why Judge Williams resigned and left his place to Judge Møse.  Judge Møse was elected president of the Tribunal when he took over the trial.  

You know this, Mr. Prosecutor.  Please let me say this and conclude by that.  Kajelijeli was not the Rwandan government.  He is mentioned on page 19, but it is by incident that he is mentioned.  What was of interest to the commission was not Kajelijeli, Mr. Prosecutor.  It was not Gatete nor -- or Semanza.  It was Habyarimana, Juvénal, General Major Juvénal Habyarimana, the president of the republic.  And the commission had plotted with Nsengiyaremye to bring down Habyarimana.  Unfortunately for them, Nsengiyaremye withdrew.  And he withdrew, Mr. Prosecutor, and he signed with Habyarimana the letter which I have just tendered.  And when he signed that document, he fell in disgrace in the ranks of the RPF.  And he was replaced by********************************.  And let's leave Kajelijeli to the side.  Kajelijeli was nothing for the commission.  That is my answer.  So over to you for your question. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
All right.  Your Honour, I would like to have the record reflect that I completed my question at 11:15, 
Mr. Karemera began his response at 11:16 and he has now concluded at one minute to noon, 
	44 minutes of a response which ends with the suggestion:  "Leave Kajelijeli to the side.  Kajelijeli was not the government."  I can only hope that when we examine the evidence in case, that response and the time it took to deliver it will be helpful.  
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	Mr. Karemera, in the passage that I read to you some 48 minutes ago, there was a reference to Bagogwe women being raped after the authorities directed attacks against their community.  Were you aware that rape was part of the attacks that were directed against the Tutsi population in 1993? 
A.	No, I didn't know that, because this document, I didn't receive it at the time.  I wasn't in the government.  I was not supposed to receive the report.  And when I arrived at the UNDF prison, I came to know of it.  And there are many things which are said in this report, as you no doubt know.  But I did not know -- since you are asking me whether at the time when it was written I knew it, I did not know it, because it was not distributed, and I wasn't a part of any human rights association.  I wasn't in the government, and so I didn't know. 
Q.	Didn't you tell us just one hour ago that you knew the report, that you were aware of it, that it generated some response from the government, that it was denounced, and then you even brought your own document to indicate how the government responded to this report? 
A.	Yes, I read it in the UNDF.  Yes, indeed, I read it at the UNDF.  And you know I have been there 
	for 11 years.  That's different from 1993.  In 1993, I was not in the UNDF, and that document had not yet been distributed -- disclosed by the Prosecutor.  Those are your numbers, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	What is different, Mr. Karemera, is that you gave your response in the morning session, and then you had a half-hour break to consult other documents and your attorney and your co-Accused, and then you came back after the break with a long discourse and a different answer to the same question. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, you don't think you are wasting time if you had asked the same question again? 
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	Mr. Karemera -- 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:  
Mr. President --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's try and just start to conduct cross-examination, and let's move forward. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, sorry.  I will take my seat. 
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	Going back to your diary on the page with letter L, you have an indication there, and I will read it in French:  "The news as well as the images are not favourable to us."  
A.	You were talking about the page that ends by what?  I am sorry.  I don't follow you.  What letter did you mention?  
Q.	It ends with the letter L, and there are two entries that I am interested in where you say -- and I am going to read it in French -- "The images and the news are not favourable to us -- are not favourable to us, and we have to denounce them." 
A.	Can you refer to the page?  Can you carry on now?
Q.	And then you go on to suggest that you had to manage the journalists.  And then at the bottom of that same page, there's a reference to make -- and I am reading in French --"Message to the préfet not to disclose the weapons and the grenades".
A.	And what is the question?  
Q.	My question to you is:  What was the point of those entries?  To me it seems as if you are trying to hide what is actually happening in Rwanda from the journalists that were reporting on it. 
A.	No, Mr. Witness (sic).  I would refer you to the preceding page, to state that we are on 
	the 27th of June 1994.  And you have said Patrick de Saint-Exupéry was on the field.  And you are the one who brought those documents, so nothing was hidden to him, since you are the one who presented him as a witness though he did not appear.  So we are on the 27th of June 1994.  And I had --

Mr. Prosecutor, take a look at the page I just showed to you.  I had had an interview with 
Kabengera, Jean-Marie Vianney, a journalist.  Spelling of Kabengera, K-A-B-A-N-G-E-R-A (sic). Kabengera.  That reporter, that journalist -- I had granted a long interview to that journalist on the case of the roadblocks and the civil defence.  And in that interview that was broadcast on Radio Rwanda, which I am sure you are unwilling to give me so that I could use it to state what my position on that issue of roadblocks was, I had dealt with the report which I presented on the 2nd of June 1994 following the meeting of 28 May 1994.  Both on the 28th of May, the 2nd of June and the 27th of June, I had talked about those roadblocks which had to be lifted because they were disorderly, because, in addition to disorderly roadblocks, you had roadblocks that had been imposed or decided upon by local administrative authorities, that is to say, the bourgmestre, in agreement with the secteur conseiller and the members of the cellule committees.  

And at those roadblocks, both those that were disorderly as well as the civilian ones, things were happening which were unmentionable.  People were being killed.  People were held to ransom.  And everything was being done, save that was expected of the roadblock.  But I, Édouard Karemera, as minister of the interior, was against that, and I had publicly requested in a lengthy interview the 
préfets and bourgmestres to stop and fight these unlawful roadblocks and to better manage the roadblocks that they had set up.  

And what you don't know -- and I understand you.  That is not my position, but it's a reflection of the discussions that were held in cabinet meetings.  Because when I go there, I don't speak there as myself.  I give a synopsis of the discussions in the cabinet meetings.  And there are people who took the floor and said that, indeed, in roadblocks some people, indeed, had weapons and they had grenades.  These unlawful roadblocks are what I denounced.  And they said -- those who took the floor during the discussions said that.  And I thought that it was something significant, and that's why I noted it.  So it was not to hide anything, rather, I believe, in order not to be overtaken by the French soldiers who were going through those roadblocks.  If that is what you referred to, if you believe that you did not want the French soldiers to see this, well, that's what was written, and that's what was discussed.  But my position was that on roadblocks there were things that were happening that were inadmissible and which I denounced as minister of the interior.  

I believe that my counsel, if they had had the privilege of having obtained from you the interview that I made, they would have used it.  But on the contrary, they know the position that I took on the 28th and which I carried on within the report I gave to the meeting with the préfets on 2nd June 1994.  You may want to refer to that.  That was my position on the roadblocks. 
Q.	How often did you discuss the problem of rape committed by soldiers or militiamen in cabinet meetings? 
A.	Never. 
Q.	Is it your suggestion that you were not aware of the massive and systematic rapes that were going on across the country perpetrated by soldiers and militiamen? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, do you know what war is?  Do you know what soldiers are in war?  Come on.  Do you know soldiers in a war?  Have you seen a soldier returning from the front after having spent 15 days there?  Have you seen one?  I believe no.  So do not ask me if I was aware.  Don't ask me if we punished them.  I was not a minister of defence.  I was not a prime minister.  I entered the government on the 20th of May, and the number of cabinet meetings I attended, I found in my diary, that issue did not arise.

But ask me, Édouard Karemera, what I meant and to tell you that soldiers in -- during war do not rape women.  I find that ridiculous.  I believe you know what is happening in Iraq with American soldiers, or maybe you no longer know.  You are talking about -- don't tell me that you are so concerned about genocide in Rwanda that you don't know what's happening elsewhere in the world.  During wartime soldiers rape women, and that is regrettable.  But don't ask me.  I was not in charge of punishing soldiers who raped women.  Quite to the contrary -- to the contrary, Mr. Prosecutor, I denounce soldiers who run away from the front and came back to rape women and pillaged.  I denounced this in my reports and my meeting of the 28th with the préfet.  And in the report that I sent -- I made to the population, I denounced that.  I did what you're asking me to do that -- I asked the minister of the defence to sanction those soldiers, those people, who go into the population and created insecurity, especially by raping women.  I denounced that and have the proof that I did so. 
Q.	And you were aware of the militiamen, Interahamwe raping Tutsi women during -- over the course of April, May, June and July; isn't that so?  It's not just the soldiers.  It was the Interahamwe and the militiamen that had been incorporated in the civil defence.  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, the civil defence, we already discussed that.  Now you are placing it in April while I gave you the background.  The Interahamwe, the militia or the soldiers who raped women, who pillaged during the war, do you want me to say to this Chamber that I counted them or that I followed them where they were raping?  The question I would like to ask you, rather, is that:  Why do you think that I, Édouard Karemera, should be responsible for these confessed criminals?  What is my responsibility to this?  If you had been there, what would you have done?  And when you heard that they were raping women, what would you have done?  I was not in charge of Interahamwe, one.  Secondly, I was not in charge of the soldiers.  Thirdly, the power was -- there was lawlessness.  The bandits had taken over the law because -- if that's what you are calling the Interahamwe, I agree.  

Now I put my hand -- finger to the fire.  It was not the Interahamwe za MRND.  It was what was attributed to that based on your files.  Now you know what the Interahamwe means, so you do not talk to me about Interahamwe without specifying what you are referring to.  If these are the bandits, I denounce them, and it proves they are there, and you are the one who distributed them, and we discussed it.  Now if you want to come back to it by -- then let me have the same documents on the basis on which we discuss, and yet you are going to say that I am the one who is wasting the time. 
Q.	So, Mr. Karemera, when on page ending in alphabet 'N' of your handwritten diary or your agenda N.M.N --
A.	Letter N or M?  One minute please.  Give me a sec.  I have it. 
Q.	In the middle of the page, at the fourth bullet point where you write in regard to the weak points, 
	"points faible".  And I will read it in French.  "The violence perpetrated by some soldiers and pillaging, rapes and revenge".  I am assuming, since you are writing this, that you are reflecting on or you are commenting on the discussions that were held in the cabinet meeting of the 1st of July.  So, looking at your own handwritten notes, wouldn't you agree with me that the fact that you wrote it in your handwriting should indicate that rape was being discussed in a cabinet meeting when you were a member of the interim government at least once, as it's indicated in your notes? 
A.	No.  But when you asked me the question, Prosecutor, I referred you to the date of the cabinet meeting.  But now you have also stated -- you have acknowledged that we are on the 1st of July.  Now, since you are following the notes -- and that's what chronology means, unless that's what you usually do, by ambushing people.  You kept that for the last.

	But let me firstly tell you that that was not my position because I have just stated what my position was, what my answer with regard to that pillaging, those rapes and those settling of scores.  And if you didn't know it, let me tell you.  The minister of defence had brought with him the army chief of staff, and he was the one who was analysing the strong points and the weak points of his army, and he was the head of the army.  And he was informing the government that it is indeed among the weak links in the army, which were a source of concern for him with regard to the likelihood of losing the war.  You have those -- those are the soldiers who were speaking, not Karemera, Édouard, who is speaking.  And my position is well known.  

So if you have any further questions, you are free to ask it.  But I didn't say that I was for that -- those violences.  I didn't deny them.  And if I don't notice that, you kept that ambush, and on the 21st of July we talked about this as well.  I give in to you.  But I can't say -- going to look at all the dashes that are found in this diary -- although I say that I can acknowledge it, which is true, because I am the one who wrote it.  And you can read it or understand it.  You do not have to bring the Guichaoua expert, as was required in the Pauline Nyiramasuhuko diary.  My diary is clean and clear.  It is maybe my shortcoming to be a perfectly clean and clear person.  Maybe that's why I am here. 
Q.	And what I suggest to you, Mr. Karemera, the problem of Interahamwe raping women had 
	gotten to such enormous proportions that even on RTLM, towards the end of the violence in June, Ananie Nkurunziza had to address it during his broadcast of the 21st of June 1994.  If you look in the French text of document 1B in the second bundle of documents that were circulated, this is a transcript that was admitted in evidence in our case.  It's P. 253.  The English text is 1A; the French text is 1B.  In the English text, I am referring to page 4, which would be page 6 in the French text.  And I think we can both read this to ourselves.  I am not going to take the time of reading the whole paragraph into the record since it is in evidence. 
A.	What page?  
Q.	Page 6 in the French, starting with the words "On parle toujours".  And there's a dark line above that paragraph.  It should be very easy to find the paragraph that I am referring you to. 
A.	Yes, I found it. 
Q.	Ananie -- if you read it to yourself, I will continue to ask the question.  He seems to adopt the same analysis of what's going on as you do.  Everything that is unlawful that the Interahamwe are doing is because they are infiltrated.  When he talks about rapes by Interahamwe, he is suggesting that it is the infiltrators within the Interahamwe that are raping.  But look at what he says.  You can read the paragraph to yourself. 
A.	No.  I don't have to read it.  I don't have to read it, because let me tell you -- who is Ananie?  Who is Ananie?  What have I to do with Ananie?  When Ananie spoke to the RTLM, did you find a single contribution made by Karemera on RTLM which you could add to this file?  There was none.  And maybe during the break you'll look for one.  Now you are bringing Ananie.  Who is Ananie?  I don't know Ananie.  I didn't spend my time to listen to RTLM.  What do you want me to do with Ananie?  And I do not know Ananie.  And you probably don't know Ananie either.  So let's carry on.  Ananie, Kambanda, Nyiramasuhuko -- all those people who spoke, you just have to indict them or bring them here.  If you believe that they are good witnesses, then confront me with them, and I challenge them.  But don't bring me pieces of paper that you pick from here and there and ask me to comment.  Why should I comment on them, Ananie's discussion on RTLM?  Tell me why. 
Q.	Mr. Karemera, wasn't it your suggestion earlier on and in your book that RTLM was a useful arm of the republic in its fight against the enemy? 
A.	Well -- but what page in my book?  My book is here.  Tell me which page I should read for the interest of the Chamber.  Give me the page.  I will comment on it.  Because this is something we can discuss on.  Yes.  That's the answer.  I gave you the answer. 
Q.	Would you kindly just answer the question? 
A.	Yes.  I ask you, Counsel for the Prosecutor, to indicate where I wrote that.  That would allow me to tell you why I wrote it, because I don't deny.  Maybe I wrote it, but if you refer Karemera, the book -- you have it, and I have it.  It's here.  Refer to the page.  So let's discuss on the same level, simply on level ground.  Do not say things you cannot -- you cannot justify by references.  That's why I brought these things, and we are going to get that in a while. 
Q.	Is it your position that RTLM was a useful arm to assist the republic? 
A.	Did the RPF have a tool which helped government?  The RPF?  Is that what you are suggesting to me?  Could you rephrase please, because what I heard is completely shocking.  I am -- Mr. Prosecutor, I am stunned.  RPF as a tool of the Rwandan government?  Maybe you are tired.  Then ask for a break.  
	As a matter of fact, indeed, I would like to ask leave from the President for a short break to go to the washroom.  That way you can cross-check with the interpreter what he interpreted. 
MR. WEBSTER:
	I see, Mr. Karemera has already disengaged from his headsets.  So I am assuming he is not hearing me now.  
THE WITNESS:  
Mr. President (microphones overlapping).
MR. PRESIDENT:
I heard you, Mr. Karemera.  I heard you.  We are considering whether to take the luncheon adjournment now.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  So it is just five minutes before lunch.  I think we will take the luncheon adjournment now.
(Court recessed at 1224H)
(Pages 23 to 38 by Judith Kapatamoyo)










(Court resumed at 1405H) 
MR. WEBSTER:
Good afternoon to everyone.  Good afternoon to the Court, the parties --
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	And to you, Mr. Karemera.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	We are going to go on to something else.  I'd like to start by asking you when the interim government abandoned Kigali on the 12th of April and relocated in Murambi.  The minister of defence did not reside with you in Murambi, did he? 
A.	The minister of defence had found a room at the bishopric in Kabgayi.  He was not in Murambi.  You are right.  
Q.	But he travelled back and forth to Murambi, as was needed for government affairs.  Would that be right? 
A.	I would not know about that.  I was not in charge of the monitoring of his comings and goings.  And it is not only between Murambi and Kabgayi.  He would also move between Gitarama and Kigali.  And he would also go to the Rwandan armed forces positions.  That was his job.
Q.	Do you know where the army chief of staff was based?  Was that in Kigali or Murambi or elsewhere? 
A.	This was a military secret.  I was not a soldier and I was not interested.  
Q.	But, in any case, you are aware that the minister of defence would go and visit with the army 
	chief of staff.  I believe that's what you just stated anyway.  I can move on.
A.	But it could also -- it could not be otherwise. 
Q.	Would the minister of defence have access to military vehicles and escorts probably with greater ease than you would have had, even as minister of the interior? 
A.	But, Counsel for the Prosecution, the minister of defence was the minister of defence.  He could have the escorts he wished, indeed.  But let me tell you that the army did not belong to him.  It was a war situation, and he did not need to monopolise soldiers when the front line -- when there were battles taking place on the front line.  But he had, indeed, a reinforced escort because he was more in danger than all of us because of his position.  He was on the front line with the soldiers, so he needed extra protection compared to the others -- ministers, I mean. 
Q.	And did he have access to any of the four helicopters that were used by the Rwandan army at the time? 
A.	Obviously. 
Q.	And he was not the only minister that had access to helicopters.  Wasn't there a time -- or there has been testimony in this trial that Casimir Bizimungu, who was your minister of health, I believe, travelled from Murambi to Gisenyi soon after he arrived from Kigali with the interim government on the 12th of April.  Were you aware of that? 
A.	Yes, I am aware of that. 
Q.	And getting from one end of the country to the other would have required no more than an hour or so by helicopter; wouldn't you agree? 
A.	Do you know Rwanda?  I wonder in the final analysis whether you have been to Rwanda.  Clear across the country in a helicopter would take one hour?  How can you imagine this?  Do you think that Rwanda is Zaire?  To go from Gitarama to Gisenyi using a helicopter, one might spend 25 minutes; to go from Gitarama to Bujumbura, it might take 40 minutes or so; and to go from Gitarama to Cyangugu, 30 minutes.  And I'm taking the places that are the most diametrically opposed to one another.  So unless the helicopter pilot wanted to engage in acrobatics between the two points, no one could spend an hour flying by helicopter from one point of Rwanda to the other.  Rwanda is just a small country, unless Kagame has enlarged the country and it now englobes Kivu.  But you are talking about the Rwanda of Paul Kagame which has been extended to a major part of Zaire.  But Habyarimana's Rwanda was very small. 
Q.	If one were travelling with an experienced military escort, even by road, wouldn't you agree that the voyage would probably be faster with an experienced military escort than if one were simply travelling in one's own vehicle because of the experience of the driver and the facility of getting through checkpoints or roadblocks that would be on the road? 
A.	No.  Even with the military escort, we would stop at all the roadblocks.  I am positive.  Even with military escorts, we had to stop and the control would take place.  But there were some people who would get killed at the roadblocks and they would not continue on their way. 
Q.	That's true, Mr. Karemera.  The roadblocks were a notorious killing location for the Tutsi population after the 6th of April, so I agree with you on that point.
A.	You added Tutsi, and that was not my testimony.  
Q.	So a road trip from Murambi to Ruhengeri could probably be accomplished within two or three hours if conditions were favourable; wouldn't you agree? 
A.	What do you mean by favourable conditions?
Q.	If you had a good vehicle, if you had a good driver, and if there wasn't too much traffic on the road.  
A.	But with regard to traffic, there was no problem.  Between Gitarama and Ruhengeri there is no highway, so there is no traffic.  It's not Arusha.  But as for the road, that is something else.  Even using four-by-four vehicles, when you leave the Gitarama-Ngororero road -- and I assume you know the 
	place -- to go to Ruhengeri, then it might take you close to two hours.  But from Gitarama to Ngororero it might take one hour using the tarred road.  So three hours, that was possible.  Three hours, it's feasible, but not less than three hours to go from Gitarama to Ruhengeri, especially if it is during the rainy season. 
Q.	And a helicopter would be able to accomplish the same distance in around 25 minutes, from your earlier response; would you agree?  Or less than 25 minutes.  
A.	No, 20 to 30 minutes.  20 to 30. 
Q.	Well, is that what happened on the 18th of April, Mr. Karemera?  Because I suggest to you that you were -- if you were, indeed, in Gisenyi or Ruhengeri on the 18th of April, that you either travelled by helicopter or with a very effective escort because evidence in this trial has established that you were present in Murambi at least until the early afternoon.
A.	Who has established?  Who is we?  Is it you or is it me?  Which witness established that?
Q.	How did you travel from Murambi to either Gisenyi or Ruhengeri when you claim to have been with the minister of defence on the 18th of April? 
A.	But, Counsel for the Prosecution, that was not how things happened.  We were on a mission in the Gisenyi préfecture and in the Ruhengeri préfecture.  We would not move between two points to go from Gitarama to Gisenyi or from Gitarama to Ruhengeri.  That was not how things happened.  I explained that we had a mission to carry out in the Gisenyi préfecture and in the Ruhengeri préfecture.  We travelled by road, not by helicopter.  

And at the time, Minister **************** wife was already in Gisenyi.  When we arrived in Gisenyi it was towards the end of the day on the 18th because we did not do what you are suggesting.  To go from Gitarama to Gisenyi, we crossed the whole of Gisenyi.  When you leave Bulinga you arrive in the Kibilira commune.  When you leave Kibilira you arrive in Satinskyi commune.  You pass through Kayove commune, through Karago -- no, before you pass through Giciye, Karago, Mutura, before reaching Rubavu.  If I may --   
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. Karemera, could you spell out the names, please, at every stage.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, let me start all over again.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Take your time, Mr. Karemera.
A.	I need time.  Me, I'm here since 11 years.  And I'm not asking for this information.  I know Rwanda.  I know all the names.  I'm not the one to ask that they be spelt out.  If you don't want me to spell them out, I will continue.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. Karemera, this is for the record.  Kibilira.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I will not have counsel speaking to each other.  Please address the Court.
MR. WEBSTER:
What I do notice, Your Honour, is that every time Mr. Karemera gets a challenging question, somehow there's always an objection or a request for spelling from his Defence counsel, so that's my concern.  These are the same names we've been bandying about for the last several days. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, please stop making those kind of remarks.  If you think that the record does not require spelling assistance, you can simply say that.  
THE WITNESS:
What should I do, Mr. President?  Should I spell the names out or should I just not do it?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think it's safer if you spell the names out.  It assists the record to be more accurate.  
THE WITNESS:
I am much obliged, Mr. President.  

So let me repeat.  When you leave Gitarama -- I don't need to spell it out because it's been done already, Bulinga either.  But Kibilira -- I should spell out -- is written K-I-B-I-L-I-R-A, Kibilira.  When you leave Kibilira, you reach the Satinskyi commune.  This is very complicated.  I'm not even sure I will be able to spell it out, but let me try.  S-A-T-I-S-N-K-Y-I (sic) -- Satinskyi -- Y-I-K-I (sic).  Satinskyi.  

When you leave Satinskyi, you arrive in the -- I cannot remember.  There is another commune before reaching Giciye, and Giciye is spelt G-I-C-I-Y-E.  

After Giciye you pass through the Karago commune, K-A-R-A-G-O.  And when you leave Karago, you reach the Mutura commune.  Mutura, M-U-T-U-R-A.  

After Mutura, you reach the Kanama commune, K-A-M-A -- K-A-N-A-M-A, Kanama, before you reach Rubavu commune, R-U-B-A-V-U.  Rubavu.  And those are the communes.  I have not listed all the communes because there's Kayove commune that has a common border with Kibuye and then the commune at the bottom, and then there is the other commune, the name of which I cannot remember at this stage.  

So when we left, one of our concerns was to take account of the situation that was prevailing in that préfecture, which had just spent three months without a préfet.  And the préfet on the other side was being installed.  When Counsel Diagne examined me, I explained that the purpose of the mission was to respond to the criticism that had been made of the MRND party because of the unofficial resignation of the minister of the interior, Faustin Munyazesa, and of the director of the cabinet, 
	Enoch -- 

Counsel Webster is assuming that we left Gitarama as if we were running a race to go directly to Gisenyi in the Rubavu commune without trying to determine what was happening, especially since there were those other concerns we had.  

When we reached Gisenyi, we remained there, and the minister of defence seized that opportunity to visit his wife and his children who were in Gisenyi.  I stayed at the Méridien Izuba hotel, and the following day we did not wake up early in the morning.  We woke up at a normal time.  And we had made contact with the local authorities to make sure that the préfet who had been appointed was getting ready to be installed.  And when we were going back, we went through all those other places I mentioned.  

So we did not use a helicopter.  We were on a mission.  We did not go from one point to the other.  It was a mission that we carried out during two days.  You can make any suggestions you like, but I am telling you how things happened, and this is what I can say, Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	You spent the first night in Gisenyi.  Where did you spend the second night? 
A.	On the 19th I retraced my steps.  And I believe we also had a problem when we were going back because it was in April.  There were very heavy rains.  And when leaving Ruhengeri, because we left from Gisenyi, the minister of defence stopped at the Mukamira camp.  You know where the 
	Mukamira camp is located.  It is not -- it is in the -- it is between Karago and Nkuli in Ruhengeri.  I am not from the region.  I am not certain, but I believe it is on both communes.  So he stopped there. 
Q.	My question was very to the point.  Where did you spend the next night?  I'm not asking you where you went from one place to the other now.  Just tell me where you spent the night.
A.	But, Counsel for the Prosecution, before spending the night somewhere, one has to arrive at a destination, and I am explaining to you for us not to waste any time how we carried out the mission.  If you do not want me to give you such information -- let me say that the first day we left from Gitarama we stayed in Gisenyi.  The minister of defence spent the night at his wife's house.  He had sought refuge there.  The following day we continued with our mission, and when returning towards 
	Gitarama -- we arrived in Gitarama during the night, and I spent the night in Murambi on the 19th.  And the following day, on the 20th, I made the report that you have at your disposal.
Q.	What night did you spend in Kigali? 
A.	In Kigali?  In April?  I don't understand. 
Q.	Isn't your report dated Kigali, the 20th of April? 
A.	Oh, because it was written in Kigali, it means I spent the night in Kigali?  No.  We would put the address of the government because we were not proud to be displaced by the war in Gitarama.  You know that we were not in Kigali, but we also knew that the headquarters of the government was in Kigali.  That is all.  As simple as that.  And I do not believe that because this is written here means that one would have spent the night in Kigali. 
Q.	So it's your testimony that you only spent one night away from Murambi, and that would be the night of the 18th; is that correct? 
A.	That was my testimony.  What else do you want me to say?
Q.	All I want you to do is listen to the question and answer the question.
A.	But I have already answered.  I do not know why you are repeating the same question.  It's just in order to save time. 
Q.	Do you know a person by the name of Louis Nizeyumukiza? 
A.	I don't know him, especially in the way in which it was translated.  It will not be very helpful for me to know whether I know that person or not.  Could you spell it out, and then I will make an effort to know whether I know that person or not, but I don't think the name you gave is the right name, or at least what the interpreter gave.  It is not understandable.  I did not understand correctly. 
Q.	I am referring to the bourgmestre of Masango, Louis Nizeyumukiza, N-I-Z-E-Y-U-M-U-K-I-Z-A.
A.	I do not know him personally, but I know his name.  The name rings a bell, but I have never seen him.  I don't think I have ever seen him, and I don't think he has ever seen me either.  But I know about him.  I know that he was, indeed, the bourgmestre of Masango commune and that he replaced -- or, rather, his predecessor was Mpamo Esdras.  Mpamo, M-P-A-M-O.  Mpamo Esdras.  Nizeyumukiza as a bourgmestre, the name rings a bell, but I do not know him personally.  I never had the opportunity to meet him.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Karemera, on the 22nd of February 2007, Peter Robinson, Defence Counsel for Joseph Nzirorera, interviewed Louis Nizeyumukiza in the presence of a representative of the Prosecution.  And it just so happens that I was that representative and I was assisted by one of our interns at the time.  And that intern took notes of Peter Robinson's interview, which was later formalised in an interview report which was circulated to the parties in my second binder as document 2C.  I only have a copy in English.  That interview report reflects the substance of Peter Robinson's interview of Louis Nizeyumukiza.  

And, as documented in that report, Peter Robinson identified himself as a Defence investigator for Joseph Nzirorera and asked Mr. Nizeyumukiza about the meeting of the 18th of April in Murambi and what happened at that meeting and who was present.  And in his response to Peter Robinson's questions, Mr. Karemera, the bourgmestre of Masango, said that you, Édouard Karemera, were present at that meeting on the 18th of April and that you encouraged the Gitarama bourgmestres to support the Interahamwe.  And the account that he gave to Peter Robinson was substantially the same account that Witness FH gave to this Chamber when he testified in this trial.  

So in addition to FH and to*************************, here we have a third person that reported to another Defence counsel that you were present and that you encouraged the bourgmestres to support the Interahamwe that came from Kigali.  What do you have to say about that?  
A.	Mr. Webster, why are you showing me the investigation information from Mr. Nzirorera?  You know, that Nizeyumukiza was your witness.  I know that you know this because you disclosed his statements of 2003.  And you know that the bourgmestre of Musambira commune who was in prison 
	with him -- Musambira is spelt M-U-S-A-M-B-I-R-A.  Musambira, who was also in prison at the time, was your witness.  You know this.  There were four of them.  There was*************************, FH, Nizeyumukiza -- the pseudonym I can't remember -- and the other.  But, in any case, there were four of them from Gitarama who came to speak of my presence on the 18th.  

You appeared -- you compared the statements because you are very intelligent, and the four were contradicting one another, and you preferred to bring ********************and FH and the two others, you withdrew them from your list.  Now you are bringing something which is dated 2008 or 2009 -- I don't know because I can't see the date -- and you want to make me believe that you do not know that he was your witness.  Knowing -- is that what you want to make the Chamber believe?  Why are you not showing me his first statements?  And you are expecting Counsel Peter Robinson for his interview on behalf of Mr. Nzirorera to put to me what he told Peter Robinson.  Bring the statements which he made in 2003, since he was your witness, and you know and I know the content.  And if you wish, I can refresh your memory.  That is my observation. 
Q.	The question in my mind, Mr. Karemera, is how you managed to travel from Murambi in the afternoon of the 18th of April to wherever you went with the minister of defence that brought you to Gisenyi the following day.  What I would suggest to you is that it was possible to be both in Murambi in the morning and the early afternoon on the 18th and to be in either Gisenyi or Ruhengeri the following day or even later that same night.
A.	But, Mr. Prosecutor, when you had asked me whether I had spent the night of the 18th in Gisenyi, which night were you referring to in the final analysis?  Were you talking about the night of the 
	17th to the 18th?  There was a misunderstanding if that's what you intended to say.  I left from Gitarama very early in the morning of the 18th, and we spent the night in Gisenyi, Minister Bizimana with his wife in one house, which belonged to the Belgian corporation, and I spent the night at the Méridien hotel.  That was the night of the 18th to the 19th.  

Now, on the 19th we did the return trip, and we went through Ruhengeri commune.  You didn't ask us where we passed.  And we arrived at nightfall in Gitarama the night of the 19th.  And now you're telling me, or you are putting it to me things which have nothing to do with what I have already told you.  But you can always make proposals to me, but there must be some kind of coherence in your questions and the answers that I have given.  Otherwise, there will be no coherence. 
Q.	Mr. Karemera, you are the only one that knows where you spent the night on the 
	17th or the 18th or the 19th.  And where you spent the night is really not an issue in dispute in this trial.  What is in issue in this trial is where you were in the morning and in the early afternoon on the 18th, and that's what concerns the Prosecution.  So all I am suggesting to you is that wherever you were the following day or that night is irrelevant, but evidence in this trial suggests that you were in Murambi with the interim government and with the Gitarama bourgmestres on the morning of the 18th and on the early afternoon of the 18th.
A.	But that is written in the indictment, and the evidence is which?  You must provide the evidence.  Is it Witness*********?  Is it Witness FH?  Is it Witness Nizeyumukiza, who you failed to call to the bar?  So what evidence are you referring to, Mr. Webster, so I can explain myself?  Because you're the one to provide the evidence.  You can't just say it like that, ex cathedra, that there is evidence.  All the time you are saying, "We.  We."  And I'm asking you, Who is "we"?  And now you're saying that there is evidence.  Where is this evidence?  What evidence is it?  Is it documentary evidence?  Is it testimonial evidence?  What kind of evidence are you talking about, Mr. Prosecutor?  There is none, and you know that.  This is why you are putting to me incoherent proposals in relation to the responses which I have given you, and you want to displace the night which I spent in Gisenyi to say that I spent the night in Gisenyi on the night of the 17th or the 18th.  No, I said we left Murambi on the 18th in the morning, and I wasn't rushing.  I was on mission to get to know the situation prevailing in that préfecture.  I wasn't hurrying to go and sleep, contrary to what you're saying.  But if the Hôtel Méridien is better than the room one was occupying in Murambi, I went there for an official mission.  Rather, let us discuss with you this report because you are once again wasting your own time in suggestions which have no meaning.  
Q.	The explanation that you gave to Maître Diagne, when you were examined in chief, is that you would not have been a part of that meeting on the 18th because that meeting on the 18th was of the préfectoral council in Gitarama which would only have concerned the préfet and the bourgmestres and the heads of the departments in Gitarama.  

And what I'd like you to respond to is how this meeting was described on Radio Rwanda the following day.  This is -- I'm going to refer to another document that has been circulated.  It's document 2A.  It's already in evidence.  It's P. 105, B for the English, A for the French, and at the bottom of page 5 in the English, Hyacinthe Bicamumpaka, who was the Radio Rwanda journalist, reported as follows -- and I will read one short paragraph:  

"The prime minister, His Excellency Jean Kambanda, yesterday presided over a meeting in Gitarama grouping representatives of religious organisations, leaders of all of the political parties in the country, the bourgmestres of the communes of the Gitarama préfecture and all of the heads of services of that préfecture. 
A.  	Can you please let me have the correct page because I -- just a moment.  I have to change my spectacles.  I didn't follow what you read.  I'm sorry.  I was looking for the document, and now I have to change my glasses.  
Q.	For the French text, it's document 2B.  I have even numbered the paragraph.  That's my indications in handwriting on the left-hand side, and I am referring to paragraph number 11, so it should be very easy for you to find in the French text.  It's on page 8 -- page 8 of the French text, paragraph 11.  
A.	All right.  I am with you, Mr. Prosecutor.  I'm with you. 
Q.	And what I'm suggesting to you is that you were wrong when you testified in direct that you would not have been invited to that meeting because it was restricted to the préfectoral council of Gitarama, because, as reflected in the broadcast made on Radio Rwanda the following day that reports on that meeting, the journalist stated as follows.  And I just read it, but I will read it again, since it's a very 
	short -- it's not a particularly long passage.  

"The prime minister, His Excellency Jean Kambanda, yesterday presided over a meeting in Gitarama grouping representatives of religious organisations, leaders of all of the political parties in the country, the bourgmestres of the communes of the Gitarama préfecture, and all of the heads of services of that préfecture."  

So my suggestion to you, as reflected in this broadcast, is that if you were present in Murambi, as we suggest you were, you would have been invited or expected to be present in that meeting on the 18th.
A.	But, Mr. Prosecutor, do you want to inform the Chamber that you no longer believe in what your witness, ********************, préfet of Gitarama, said before this Chamber?  And let me remind you what he said, because I'm sure that you know it, but let me remind you so that this will be on the record.  ********************said that he was the one who called the meeting and that his meeting was taken over by Prime Minister Kambanda.  The Defence witness, Jean-Paul Akayesu, who was bourgmestre of Taba commune, who was one of the guests and who was convicted, as you made him shed tears here, he was condemned to life imprisonment because he testified in my favour because he no longer had nothing to lose, as you will recall.  

He had been a guest at that meeting, and that meeting, which was to take place in the building of the Gitarama préfecture, had been transferred at around 6:30 p.m., where the people who were invited had already assembled to be transported to Murambi at about 10:30, 11.  And now you want to give me the reporting of a journalist who didn't even attend the meeting to come to the testimony of your witness who had called this meeting.  

Let me add -- let me add, Mr. Prosecutor, that there was a journalist, a permanent journalist -- a permanent journalist, Gaspard Rwakana -- and Rwakana is spelt R-W-A-K-A-N-A, Rwakana -- and he was a Tutsi.  Unfortunately, he is deceased, Gaspard Rwakana.  He was the permanent representative of the ORINFOR in Gitarama, and he was the one doing the reporting.  So why are you bringing the reporting brought by -- made by Hyacinthe Bicamumpaka who probably was in Kigali and who was not in Gitarama?  Because the reporting was done by a journalist who was a resident in Gitarama, Gaspard Rwakana, and you have this.  

Well, you can take what suits you, use what you have used from your witnesses, and you can say Kambanda invited me.  But I am coming to it.  How could Kambanda invite me?  In what capacity could he invite me?  The préfet of Gitarama said that he called all those whom he thought were responsible in Gitarama, or officials in Gitarama, so that they could speak about the security.  So he invited the chairmen of parties which developed from Gitarama.  So you are now telling me of a paragraph which was misreproduced by a journalist who wasn't there at the meeting, and you want to conclude that Kambanda invited me.  Why would Kambanda have invited me?  He was not the chairman of the party in Gitarama.  I was not a member of his government.  In what capacity would he invite me to attend that meeting which, by the way, your witness confirmed that he had taken over for reasons which I am unaware of because I was not there.  Let me stop there.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
	(No interpretation)
 MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there a problem?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Mr. President.  I didn't switch on my microphone.  I'm really sorry.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry.  We did not get the interpretation of your submissions.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
That happens, Mr. President.  I will repeat.  

The Prosecutor said -- or, he challenged the witness with a statement from the bourgmestre of Masango.  Now, first of all, I want us that we re-establish the facts, and I was saying, Mr. President, Your Honours, that I didn't want to be accused of having interrupted the witness from answering.  This is why I am speaking now.  This document which is bearing the reference 2C is signed by Mr. Don Webster.  And Mr. Robinson who -- my colleague Robinson, whom he said attended the interview -- and I'm not denying it -- did not sign the document.  And it is said -- no signature from the bourgmestre of Masango.  And this was for the record, and this was my first comment.  

My second observation, Mr. President, Your Honours, to the contrary, we have a signed statement from the bourgmestre of Masango.  And, Mr. President, please allow me to say how pained I am when I see the Prosecutor behaving in such a manner and trying to abuse the witness.  We are here all in order to discover the truth.  The bourgmestre of Masango who signed the statement which was disclosed to us, that statement is dated 20th August 2003.  It says exactly the following, Mr. President, that in the month of May, in May, Mr. Karemera, who had become minister for the interior, attended a meeting.  I'm going to read to you literally.  "During that month of May, Édouard Karemera, who was occupying the post of minister for the interior for some time, was living in Kilinda and crossed my commune to go there.  He remained there even after the departure of the interim government in the beginning of June for Gisenyi."  
And that is the reason why the Prosecutor withdrew this witness from his list.  And he, Mr. Webster himself signs a statement which he comes to put before the witness by telling him that it was the bourgmestre of Masango who made that statement and who signed it.  

For the record, I would wish it -- that it be known that what has come to happen before your eyes, and the witness did not know all this.  He just told you that he knows why this witness was withdrawn from the list, because on the 18th of May -- it's not certainly the month of May -- he said he knows why 
he was -- the witness was withdrawn, and he is being shown a statement of May which was signed by Mr. Webster.  And the documents are there.  All the reference numbers are there.  The statement signed by the bourgmestre is bearing the number 2D, and the one signed by Mr. Webster is 2C.  And I would like to conclude by telling you that I am, indeed, disturbed by this kind of conduct.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I simply wish to inform you that the famous document 2C which Ms. Dior has just referred to, we don't have this document in our files.  In the set of documents that 
	my learned friend Webster gave to us, as if by chance, 2C, where Mr. Robinson is mentioned, is not there.  You can understand that I had wanted to speak earlier, but I would like to speak about what I know.  I have not seen the document in the file.  And in our pile of the documents which we received from Mr. Webster, we have been unable to intervene.  Can he give us this document so that we can also make our submissions.  
MR. WEBSTER:
All of the binders were produced exactly the same way.  We have extra binders here.  Mr. Issa can access any one of those and get a duplicate statement if it doesn't -- if it's not in Mr. Nimy's binder.  And if it was a lapse on our part, I apologise for that.  

But with respect to Ms. Dior Diagne's comments, I am a bit surprised, quite frankly, because if she had been listening to how I articulated my question she would have heard that I made it quite explicit that an intern that was assisting me took notes that were formalised in an interview report.  I did not state to this Court, and it should be obvious, since all of the documents were circulated to all of the parties, including the Court, that it was an interview report, same thing as an investigator's note.  It was never represented to be a witness statement.  

She should also take note that the witness statement from 2003 was also circulated to everyone, and I had no intention of using it.  But to make an honest presentation of the situation, it was included in this bundle so that anyone that wanted to refer to it could do so.  So I am a bit surprised that she brings all of this to the attention of the Court as if something underhanded was being done when I made every effort to be quite clear about how the information from this particular person was documented.  

Thirdly, as to the reason for the interview report in the first place, it's because this witness was anticipated to be a Prosecution witness.  But in our efforts to reduce the number of witnesses that were being called, we dropped him because his evidence was not as compelling as other witnesses.  But Mr. Robinson, with his usual very diligent and aggressive manner, wanted to see every witness that had ever been listed by the Prosecution and arrange for an interview with this witness, for which I was present, and he was quite surprised to find out that the witness had much more information than was reflected in his original witness statement in 2003, and that is what was documented in the interview report that I referred to.  
(Pages 39 to 50 by Claudette Ask)





























1500H
MR. WEBSTER (continued):
That is the chronology, and I'm a bit surprised and disappointed with Ms. Diagne's submission, because it would be clear for anyone who's thinking about the issues that the reason for placing the witness statement in the binder was so that everyone could see how the issue developed if it was of interest for the purposes of this cross-examination.  

Mr. Weyl has something to say now.  
MR. WEYL:
But, Mr. President, the explanations by Mr. Webster may represent some relevance, but if we had never been one time faced with the same procedure -- because this is a procedure when it's made to believe that there's an interview, when it is, in fact, a document that Mr. Webster established himself in an attempt to create evidence which the Prosecutor is doing himself.  It's exactly what happened during the new examination of BTH, when Mr. Webster attributed a document to a witness; whereas, it was a document from his crew, and he -- it had his signature.  And he took this away from the witness because it came out that the signature was his.  

Now, if Mr. Webster is simply passing quietly over this issue, another -- it is being said that this is an interview note of the 5th of June 2008 at Gitarama prison.  It is not presented as a report which was established after the 22nd of February 2007, but you are made to believe that this is a document of an interview taken on the 5th of June 2008 at the Gitarama prison with the identification of the witness.  And there's even a cover note.  It's not a report which was drawn up by Mr. Webster.  It's a document which is presented like all the interviews with witnesses, where we have a cover page to make us believe that there was a witness, Nizeyumukiza, Louis, who was heard on the 5th of June 2008 at Gitarama, signed by Mr. Webster.  And this is a falsification.  I'm done, Mr. President, Your Honours.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President -- Mr. President, I wish to draw the attention of the Trial Chamber to what Mr. Webster said.  He says that he was transparent when he disclosed the two documents, that of 2003 and that of 2008.  But I believe, in the interest of transparency, Mr. Webster should have told the witness, when addressing him, these are the statements of the witness in 2003 and in 2008 and not merely refer to the 2008 document.  Because in doing so, on purpose, he wanted one to believe that that witness had provided evidence that Mr. Édouard Karemera was present at the meeting of the 18th of April.  

And as I was saying in cross-examination, it is not normal to present a false hypothesis to the witness.  This is prohibited, and this is telling with regard to the unfairness or disloyalty shown here.  

When a witness is interviewed or examined, one has to put questions to the witness on specific facts and not on fabricated facts.  And this is the issue we're raising here.  For a long time, we asked that Mr. Webster be sanctioned, and I believe it is high time for him to be sanctioned.  I thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I think the problem is that the document is only available in English -- we don't have a French translation for it -- because anyone that could read and understand the text would realise that everything is quite clearly documented in the substance of that interview report itself.  

So I refuse to take offence at remarks that are clearly offensive, because I am assuming that neither Dior Diagne or Félix Sow or Frédéric Weyl have understood the text that they have been trying to read.  But I'm sorry that we don't have the translation.  I'll continue.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President -- Mr. President, this is the Defence of Mr. Karemera that is addressing you.  This is evidence on a specific issue of the indictment, the meeting of the 18th of April, which has been discussed extensively.  

It seems that we do not understand much as the French speakers.  Mr. President, we quite solemnly request that this issue be dealt with, because it seems that we have not understood, and we accept that.  We are not experts.  We accept that we have shortcomings and shortfalls.  

We are not going to continue, Mr. President.  It is not normal for us to continue because we have been told that evidence could be admitted into evidence with regard to the presence of Mr. Karemera on the 18th of April provided by the bourgmestre of Masango.  And since the witness is answering questions on a self-fabricated document, we are not insulting anyone, Mr. President.  We are civilised people.  We are not insulting our colleague.  He is our learned colleague, and we work with loyalty.  

He self-fabricated this evidence.  Even though there was another piece of evidence that was available, he did not tell the witness that such a document was -- existed.  And it is on the basis of this document that the witness is working, Mr. President.  

So the Defence of Mr. Karemera is solemnly asking on what basis Mr. Karemera should answer the questions of Mr. Webster.  We are tired of hearing him say "I shall proceed" every single time he is caught red-handed.  I believe this should be clear.  I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, we don't wish to hear any more on this subject.  
MR. WEBSTER:
May I continue?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We think that the examination can continue now.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Karemera, you were suggesting that somehow it was -- you were suggesting that the evidence from ************************was contradicted by the Radio Rwanda broadcast that I put to you.  And I would suggest the contrary.  It's not contradicted.  In fact, on the issue of how the meeting started, Mr. Akayesu and Mr. ************* and Mr. FH and Mr. Nizeyumukiza are all consistent, because the 
	Radio Rwanda broadcast does not address how the meeting started.  It simply addresses what happened at the meeting.  

But, beyond that, we also have the account of that same meeting provided by Justin Mugenzi in his trial and Pauline Nyiramasuhuko in her trial.  And you will agree with me that Justin Mugenzi was a minister, as was Pauline a minister, on the 18th of April.  And both of them had been invited to that meeting and attended it and provided consistent accounts of being invited to attend that meeting by the prime minister.  What do you have to say to that?  
A.	But, Counsel for the Prosecution, I am going to answer your question, but I also wish to make a request to you.  What would be the interest of Counsel Peter Robinson to go and investigate?  It was in order to charge Karemera?  Is that what you want me to understand, that Peter Robinson went to assist you in order to come up with the evidence you are producing here?  

I would have expected -- of course, I am not raising an objection because I'm not a lawyer here, but I'm your prisoner.  But I would have expected you to put questions to me on the result of 
	Peter Robinson's enquiry because you are starting -- I do not read English that well, but I am going to try.  "February 2007.  The undersigned senior Prosecution counsel was present -- was present when Peter Robinson, Defence counsel for Joseph Nzirorera, interviewed Louis Nizeyumukiza in the Gitarama prison." 

I shall stop here.  Why don't you bring the interview?  Why don't you bring Peter Robinson's report?  Because that would be credible.  He was the one who went to conduct the investigations.  I did not know that he was an investigator.  I knew that he was the lead counsel for my co-accused,
	Joseph Nzirorera.  You are stating in that document that he went to investigate and that you assisted.  

Have you become Peter Robinson's secretary so that you would -- the two of you would forge evidence against Karemera?  Is that what you want the Trial Chamber to understand?  I'm surprised.  
Now, with regard to your question you have asked me -- you have asked me -- 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, if I may.  
My apologies, Mr. Karemera.  
THE WITNESS:
But I'm defending myself.  I am the one in the stand.  
MR. NIMY:
I concur with you, and it is in order to support you that I am taking the floor.  
THE WITNESS:
I would rather let -- I would rather you let me answer the Prosecutor first, and then you will defend me later on, Counsel Nimy, because I am angry now.  I am angry.  

When counsel for the Prosecution dares to come and mislead the Trial Chamber by saying that he has become Peter Robinson's rapporteur, that cannot be done, Mr. President.  I am an accused person.  I am a prisoner.  I am nothing.  But I do understand things.  

	What I understand is that the Prosecutor went to Gitarama with Peter Robinson, who became Nzirorera's investigator, and that Peter Robinson interviewed one Nizeyumukiza, Louis, and that Webster was taking notes, and that, contrary to Kayishema, he signed alone.  Why did you not sign with Peter Robinson?  Why?  

You are asking me whether ***********************made a mistake with regard to my presence when the report was made on Radio Rwanda.  I put a specific question to you.  This document is in your case file.  Gaspard Rwakana, do you know him?  Have you ever heard of him?  Gaspard Rwakana was the representative -- the permanent representative of the Rwandan information bureau in Gitarama.  He reported on this meeting.  Hyacinthe Bicamumpaka was a presenter on Radio Rwanda.  He reported the information that was sent to him from Gitarama, and he was not there, from what I understand, because there were -- there was only one representative of ORINFOR in Gitarama.  I am positive about that, and I know the two of them.  I know Rwakana.  He has died, unfortunately.  As for 
	Hyacinthe Bicamumpaka, I don't know, but he probably also died in the forests in the Congo.  

Now, tell me why it is that you're not bringing to me the report made by Gaspard Rwakana.  Why?  Why?  

Your witness*********************, who was the préfet and who was****************************, came here and talked about that meeting.  He complained that Kambanda had, in fact, monopolised his security meeting.  It is in the transcripts.  And I have perused the transcripts, if you want to know.  
	**************************never said that Kambanda was the one who convened the meeting.  

And also, Counsel for the Prosecution, sadly, you are now bringing Mugenzi and Nyiramasuhuko, and you are stating that during their trials, they, indeed, admitted that, upon invitation -- the invitation of Prime Minister Kambanda, they attended the meeting that was monopolised by Kambanda, and which did not take place in Gitarama but, rather, in Murambi.  But it is only normal because Mugenzi and Nyiramasuhuko depended on Kambanda.  They were his ministers.  Was I a minister of Kambanda on the 18th of April?  Did Kambanda have any authority on the vice-president of the MRND to convene him to a meeting which he had not convened but that he monopolised?  

Is that what you wish -- is that what you want the Trial Chamber to believe?  I hope that the Trial Chamber will not follow you in your error, because you are erring, Counsel for the Prosecution.  

Nyiramasuhuko was the minister for family affairs.  Mugenzi was the minister of trade.  Karemera was first vice-president of the MRND.  On the 18th of April, he was facing criticism from those who were complaining that the MRND could be an accomplice of the RPF since it did not want to provide candidates for the position of minister of the interior when the situation required that such a position should not remain vacant.  Édouard Karemera was confronted with the requests of the ministers who were members of the government but who were MRND members, and, more particularly, Minister Bizimana of defence, who was being criticised because of the accusations against Ruhigira, or at least his suspicion of Ruhigira and Munyazesa.  And that is the reason for our mission in Gisenyi.  You might not believe it.  You might not believe me.  That is your right.  

	But what you're bringing here does not correspond to anything.  It is like Kayishema's draft that you brought here yesterday.  And I'm sorry, but this has not been signed by its author, except for you.  And since you did not interview that gentleman and that it was Robinson who interviewed it, what I could deem to be credible is the report of the interview signed by the person who was putting questions.  

You didn't ask any questions.  You just seized the opportunity to forge.  As your learned colleague said, forged.  You forged it.  You should acknowledge it, Counsel for the Prosecution.  You forged this document.  And this is serious, because you need to acknowledge that you have nothing against Karemera, Édouard.  It would be more honest, Counsel for the Prosecution.  But I know you will not do that.  But I have full trust in the Judges. 
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	Mr. Karemera, do you recall encountering General Ndindiliyimana and General Rusatira on the 22nd of April 1994 in Murambi?  
A.	I do not remember.  I do not believe I met with Rusatira, but it -- I might have met with Ndindiliyimana because he had established his headquarters in Gitarama, and Gitarama is small.  He would be at the hotel between Murambi and the préfecture on the same road.  So our paths might have crossed.  That is for sure.  As for Rusatira, he was in Kigali, and I cannot say that I met him.  I don't see how -- where I would have met him.  As for Ndindiliyimana, it is possible.  For Rusatira, it is almost impossible.  
Q.	Well, I'm referring to an incident that was in -- that was the subject of testimony from ***************  when he gave evidence in this trial.  You should be familiar with that incident because you addressed it through your direct examination with Maître Dior Diagne.  

So I'm referring to the meeting -- actually, it was not a meeting.  It was an encounter with you on the grounds of Murambi, which he placed as occurring on the 22nd of April.  

And your defence to that evidence, as I understand it from your direct evidence just last week, was that such a meeting was a military meeting, and it would not have incorporated a civil -- a civilian person like yourself.  That's my recollection of your evidence.  If I've misstated it, then certainly you will correct me.  But this is something that you discussed with Dior Diagne just last week.  
A.	Let me correct you immediately, and I wish for the draft transcript to be brought to us, because I think your memory is failing you.  I never said that it was a meeting of soldiers.  I am positive about that.  I said that it was a security meeting.  And security and the -- and the soldiers are two different things.  

I said that prior to the war, we had in Rwanda what we called interministerial committees, and there was then a security committee, an interministerial security committee that was turned into a 
	national security council or committee.  That was what I said.  And I said who were the members of this committee or council.  I said that there was the prime minister, the minister of the interior, the 
	minister of defence, the minister of justice, the director general of the central intelligence department, among other people.  So that was my response to Counsel Diagne.  

I did not say that it was a military meeting.  You are inventing, Counsel for the Prosecution.  Refer to the transcripts, give us the page, and tell the Trial Chamber what is the correct version of my testimony.  Otherwise, when you're quoting off the cuff, you are misstating my testimony.  And you're doing this on purpose, which is unfortunate.  
Q.	You, perhaps, have a better recollection of what you said than I did -- than I do.  But, in any case, you described a meeting, a formal meeting that involved military personnel.  And what I'm suggesting to you, Mr. Karemera, is that when General Ndindiliyimana and General Rusatira came to see members of the interim government and political party leaders on the 22nd of April, they simply came to look for civilian authorities.  They were not coming to a meeting.  And that's reflected in General Ndindiliyimana's testimony in his own trial from the 18th of June 2008.  

	And a portion of his testimony in his own trial was made available to the parties, at document 4C.  And there are two pages in English and two pages in French.  And I'll read an excerpt of what he says in relation to that meeting that -- not meeting but that encounter that he had on the 22nd of April.  He claims that he went and found the préfet to help him resolve some sort of problem.  And at the bottom of page 17 in the English text -- 
A.	May I be given a copy of the document?
Q,	Yes.  
MR. WEBSTER:  
	The registry can give the witness document 4C.  
THE WITNESS:
Could you wait until the document is given to me, otherwise we'll have to start all over again.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And in the French text, it's in the middle of page 18, but there are -- the two pages of transcript are stapled together, and both are identified as 4C in the bundle.  
A.	Yes.  I now have the document, and you can refer me to the appropriate paragraph.  
Q.	So in the French text, which is what I assume you're reading, on page 18, in the middle of the page, there's an R, which means response.  And it says "Donc, de là".  That's where I'm reading from in the English text, which is at the bottom of page 17.  
A.	Yes, I'm there, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	General Ndindiliyimana says, "So I went to see -- I went to the préfet of Gitarama préfecture and asked if he could intervene, particularly in respect of dealing with those members of the population who had come in and were creating a problem throughout the secteur."  

He's finishing off an account of something else.  The other thing that he describes is really not germane to our enquiry, so I've started it in the middle of his account, actually.  

And then Ndindiliyimana is asked to spell Kamonyi, which is a word that he had used previously.  And he spells it K-A-M-O-N-Y-I.  And he continues in his testimony.  "Kamonyi is located between Kigali and Gitarama, some 16 or 20 kilometres away from Kigali.  There is a small centre in that city which has developed around the activities of nuns and clergy who had settled in that area."  

And then he continues with his account saying, "So I went to see the *******and told him that there were some problems.  Together with the*********, we went to the meeting with the government along with General Rusatira.  I was the messenger or the message bearer, and after that incident with the journalists, as well as all of the crowd that was outside -- some were heckling while others were saying words of encouragement -- it is straight from that context that I went into the meeting and dealt directly with the crux of the matter, namely, extending the message from the armed forces calling on the government to increase its efforts towards pacification of the country."  

	And he continues.  "I refer to the problem of Interahamwe, who had now left the capital and were operating in various displaced persons camp and to move from those camps into the community at large to steal and commit other kinds of crimes.  
"I do think that, in fact, what happened is that Colonel Rusatira, who was in my company, again spoke of the situation and highlighted the situation of the soldiers who were at the battle front.  There was a time of reflection and discussion and remarks, and then we left."  And then he continues.  

You have the text.  You can see it and read it in context and appreciate it for yourself.  

The point I was simply making to you, Mr. Karemera, is that General Ndindiliyimana gave an account of going to Murambi in the company of General Rusatira, along with the préfet of Gitarama, which is substantially the same evidence that ******************gave when he testified in this trial -- in this trial.  

The only distinction is that Ndindiliyimana was not asked who he spoke to, because it was not an issue for him.  It was not an issue in his trial.  It's an issue in our trial because ******************says that he spoke to you or that you were among the political party leaders that were present in Murambi when he was brought into a meeting with them by General Ndindiliyimana and General Rusatira.  Do you have anything to say in response to that?  
A.	I have many things to say.  And please do not interrupt me, because I have many things to say on this matter.  

First of all, Ndindiliyimana, has he now become your witness?  Why did you not bring him here?  Because you have found these transcripts at a time when you no longer could have access to him or what?  You could have brought him here if you believe that he is a credible witness for your case.  You could call him to testify.  But his trial is not my trial.  

Secondly, your witness, ******************, if you remember well, did not know the date.  He said on the 14th or the 15th.  He said, "I believe I was going to Nyakabanda to Nyabikenye."  And he said, "No, it was not Nyakabanda; it was Mugina on the 20th, on the 20th."  And he said that the meeting with Rusatira and Ndindiliyimana had taken place at the *******************and that they had met there by chance.  Him, *******, was having difficulty finding petrol, and he was begging for petrol at the *********** **********************that -- those were his words -- when the two colonels -- and at the time they were generals.  I have demoted them, I'm sorry.  The two generals arrived there.  

I'm reporting -- or, rather, I've become a storyteller now for your benefit to remind you of what your witness said.  When the two of them got there, they said -- and this by chance -- "Oh, well, Mr. ********, we have met the prime minister, and probably you would be interested.  Would you not want to come with us?"  
This is the version provided by your witness, Counsel for the Prosecution.  And I'm being faithful to the transcripts.  We can refer to them.  

But ********************did not know on what date he met the two generals.  That is the second point.  

Third -- thirdly, these transcripts, that I do not accept -- did Ndindiliyimana say anywhere, because that would have been evidence, that among the people he met, there was Karemera?  I do not need to read this.  I know that it is not contained in this document.  If that was contained in the document, you would have focused on it.  But you know that Ndindiliyimana did not say that I was there.  

Thirdly, you're saying that Ndindiliyimana is saying that he was the message bearer.  Whose 
	message bearer was he?  When I explained the situation to Counsel Diagne, when she was asking -- putting the question to me, I said what follows.  And let me repeat it slowly for it to be faithfully reported.  

I said that, within the framework of security, the headquarters -- the chiefs of staff had met in Kigali, and they had realised that there was a deterioration of the situation both in Kigali as well as throughout the whole country.  And at the end of their meeting, they were of the opinion that it was necessary to call a security meeting of the national security council presided by the prime minister.  

And in order to help the minister for defence, who was a civilian -- Bizimana, Augustin was not a soldier.  He was the minister for defence, quite simply.  It was decided that the two generals with the minister for defence would go to present the situation that prevailed to that committee or 
	national security council presided by the prime minister.  And that was my explanation.  And since the minister for the interior was not yet there, he had declined, without so saying -- without so saying because he was constituting alibis so that you don't prosecute him.  And I think he was sly.  The minister for the interior was not there, but the minister for defence was there.  And he was a minister who came from our ranks.  This is Bizimana, Augustin.  

After that meeting in which there was mention made mainly of the Interahamwe, he came and found us, Nzirorera and myself.  And, first of all, he reported to us the concerns of the government, and he asked us whether we could do something in regard to the young Interahamwe za MRND, because it is only the Interahamwe za MRND that we addressed.  

	And we have -- we produced a communiqué going in the line with the -- the wishes of the government.  And that was all we could do.  We did not have any prison for the Interahamwe, the seditious Interahamwe.  We had no other possibility than to bring them back to order through a political message.  And we made the communiqué - or, wrote the communiqué of the 23rd April.  
So Ndindiliyimana -- well, it wasn't to you that he said this.  He defended himself as he did.  It was his trial and not mine.  But I'm merely mentioning that he did not mention Karemera being there.  So why are you saying that?  Even if politicians had been invited, why would it be needful for Karemera, himself, to be there and that you would draw that conclusion from your proposals?  Well, it's a matter of a good war being waged.  

But Prime Minister Kambanda did not have any injunctions to make of me.  He made an invitation.  ********************didn't invite me.  And, furthermore, I was not in Gitarama, so I did not have to explain myself on statements made by Ndindiliyimana to ************************** (sic) or to yourself.  

Those are my comments, and I believe I have been quite complete in them.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And one last thing, Your Honour, it should take only two minutes, I hope.  You will have to time the witness.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And to facilitate matters, rather than asking Mr. Issa to look for this document in the bundle, I'll ask him to just show you my copy, Mr. Karemera. 

This is document 4A.  It's a peripheral matter.  But this is a page from the diary of Jean Kambanda for the 22nd of April, where he has in his writing, his handwriting, the notation, (French spoken) -- I'm sorry.  To the interpreters, I'll be speaking in French.  "Meeting with the major general of the EM government headquarters", which I understand to be a reference to the general of the gendarmerie.  E/MGN, "état-major gendarmerie", which is a reference to Ndindiliyimana, and General Rusatira.  
MR. WEBSTER:
So if Mr. Issa could show this document to the witness.  It's highlighted in yellow where I'm referring to.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	But what I would suggest to you, Mr. Karemera, is that these are just bits and pieces of circumstantial evidence, that there was, indeed, an encounter between -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, you said the phrase "evidence".  What does that mean in our trial?  Is this evidence in our trial?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I believe it is admitted in evidence.  Let me -- I'm sorry, I don't have the exhibit number to hand.  But the -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I asked and you gave an answer also.  Let's move on.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I notice that -- when Mr. Karemera has an opportunity to look at the page and give a response, then I would request that we take our break.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I have the document.  Please repeat your question to me.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	My question, Mr. Karemera, is:  Do you have anything to say about that, that Kambanda's diary entry seems to indicate that he did have some sort of encounter with Ndindiliyimana and Rusatira on the 22nd of April?  If you don't accept it, that's fine.  If you do, whatever you have to say about it is your response.  
A.	But, Mr. Prosecutor, I've always said, and I'm going to say to you:  Do you, the Prosecutor, believe that this is a credible document?  What tells you -- what tells me that this comes from Kambanda?  If you were given such a document, this document which you claim is from Kambanda, do you think that you can believe that this comes from Kambanda?  Do you honestly believe so?  

Now, what about me?  I, who have been said to be the renegade in the witness box, can you want me to agree with you that this comes from Kambanda and that it can commits me -- it commits me?  Where is he speaking about Karemera?  If you had something where he indicates that, well, delegations of political parties with the MRND represented by Karemera, that would have some meaning.  But this doesn't have any meaning, and you know it.  You are -- you're totally lost, and it's unfortunate for me to have to say this to you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I think we can break now, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We take the mid-afternoon recess now. 
(Court recessed at 1545H)
(Pages 51 to 61 by Alannah Murray)











(Court resumed at 1643H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon again, Mr. Karemera.  Is everything okay now?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I saw Dr. Epée and she reassured me, Mr. President, that I may continue -- that I can continue.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, are you also okay?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm not sure.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I hope you don't want to see Dr. Epée as well. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I think it will take more than Dr. Epée. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Let's go.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Karemera, was there a time -- was there a time that you visited your home, your commune of origin in Mwendo, in the company of General Ndindiliyimana?  And, of course, I'm speaking about the period of April to July 1994.  
A.	No, at no time.  
Q.	You do agree, though, that his family was living with your family -- his wife and children were with your wife and children at your parents' home in Mwendo during the period late April to mid-May? 
A.	No.  They did, indeed, stay there for about ten days, but this was not until the middle of May, I don't believe.  Rather, it was end of April, beginning of May.  And my wife herself said -- stayed at the Ndindiliyimana home before they left together.  I can confirm that part. 
Q.	But you yourself claim that you never travelled with Ndindiliyimana to Mwendo during that period.  
A.	No.  Whilst her -- his wife and his children were at my home, he never went there to see them; and even I myself, when I arrived on the 2nd on my way to the meeting of the 3rd in Kibuye.  So, when I went there, where I spent the night on the 2nd of May, the eve before the pacification meeting in Kibuye, Ndindiliyimana's wife and his children were there.  I found them there.  But Ndindiliyimana was not with me. 
Q.	All right.  I thank you for your response.  We'll leave it there.  I'm sure you're aware that a 
	Prosecution witness has claimed that he saw you in the company of General Ndindiliyimana at some point during the period April to May of 1994.  But since you deny that, we'll move on to something else.  

Did you write a letter to General Ndindiliyimana on the 26th of April 1994 where you criticised him for having Tutsi among his personal escorts? 
A.	That was the Ndindiliyimana counsel who was saying that, and he was talking about 
	Augustin Ndindiliyimana.  Otherwise, the letter doesn't criticise him.  It was, rather, advice that I was giving him as a friend.  You know Ndindiliyimana is the godfather of one of my children -- or one of my sons.  And from then we've spent a lot of years within the government.  Even here at the prison we are friends.  So at the time -- at the time, I wasn't criticising him at all.  I was making him think, as I had done with others.  And I do recognise that letter -- it is my handwriting -- but you can show it to me if you want me to comment on anything.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Can we display document 4D to the witness, please.  This is a document that was disclosed -- excuse me, circulated to everyone.  It's a handwritten letter from Mr. Karemera dated the 26th of April 1994.  He has just acknowledged it, because, of course, it was an issue in Ndindiliyimana's trial.  I'm sure he is aware of it from that context.  It was typewritten to make it easier for us to read.  I only have it in French.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	It seems, Mr. Karemera, the only dispute that we would have is the interpretation of what you're saying in this letter.  
A.	It's a dispute between who and who?  Is it you and someone or me and Ndindiliyimana?  
Q.	I'm suggesting to you that the only disagreement that you and I may have is over what you intended by this letter, but we'll read over certain passages together and then you can explain yourself.  But you start out by saying -- and I'm going to read in French the first paragraph and then a portion of the numbered paragraph 1 and the numbered paragraph 3.  
A.	Very well.  
Q.	And so that the English speakers can understand it, I'll start off with the beginning paragraph.  

"General, following our meeting from yesterday evening, during which I gave you my assessment, and that was the only -- on the only possibility of bringing an end to the killings which continued to make numerous innocent victims, I owe it to myself to give you some information on a personal basis for verification.  I did not want to speak about them in front of your colleague yesterday evening in order not to bother you pointlessly if they were ever to be found without any grounds." 

Let me stop for a moment.  Mr. Karemera, when you refer to his collaborator, are you referring to the minister of defence?  And if not, who are you referring to?  
A.	But the minister of defence cannot be a colleague of his subordinates or collaborator.  It's, however, the minister of defence.  He was the hierarchy -- superior of the chief of staff of the army and of the gendarmerie.  He was one of the officers of his chief of staff.  I'm not sure, but it was someone who had come from Kigali to give him a report on the prevailing situation, I believe, and he was with him.  And when I was with him, he -- I wasn't invited.  He wasn't expecting me.  And when I arrived, we spoke, but I didn't go into the crux of the matter of my visit because, in fact, there was this person who was his 
	co-worker.  He was an officer, a gendarme.  Maybe Ndindiliyimana himself will remember who it was, but I didn't even know him.  But since he was an officer -- I believe he was a major or a colonel -- I believe I didn't want to share anything personal in his presence.  And neither did I want to ask him to leave.  So I preferred to come back the following morning -- to come back on the issue the following day.  
Q.	Well, then, in that case, this person that you refer to wasn't his collaborator; it was his subordinate, right? 
A.	Yes.  Better.  Better.  That was someone he worked with, a co-worker. 
Q.	You objected to -- or you question -- queried when I suggested it may have been the 
	minister of defence, because then it wouldn't have been a collaborator.  It would have been a superior.  But now you seem to be suggesting that a lower-ranked officer was his collaborator and not his subordinate.  
A.	That's not what I said.  I said that he was certainly his subordinate because he should have been an officer who was part of the gendarmerie chief of staff.  And since he was the chief of staff of the gendarmerie, his subordinate was someone who he was working with.  I'm not saying anything to the contrary. 
Q.	Thank you.  The first paragraph -- the numbered first paragraph:  "A large part of the political officers and -- both within the government and who were present in Murambi" -- 
A.	I can help you, if you wish. 
Q.	I'm not struggling with it, Mr. Karemera.  I'm simply waiting for the interpreters to translate it.  
A.	Oh, I do beg your pardon.  I thought that you had difficulty in reading my handwriting. 
Q.	--- "present in Murambi continue to criticise your decision to bring here persons who assured the guard of the prime minister, Uwilingiyimana, and Mr. ******************************.  It would seem that the 
	ministry of defence, which was informed of this concern, has still been unable to do nothing in order to change it." 

So what was the problem for you?  
A.	No, the problem wasn't mine.  Rather, it was for Ndindiliyimana.  I didn't have any problem because it wasn't me who was being criticised.  But maybe I had that problem because Ndindiliyimana was my friend and that I was somewhat sad that he was being unjustly criticised.  And the problem for him, as for those who criticised him, in fact, was a matter of security.  The gendarmerie was being seriously criticised because it had ceded many positions on the war front, especially at Mt. Jali.  Jali is spelt G-A-L-I (sic).  

They had scattered too quickly.  And the same thing happened in Rwamagana.  And in Kigali town the judicial guard held by the gendarmerie was the first post to fall into the hands of the RPF, so they were trying to say to everyone that the gendarmes -- or some people were saying that these were accomplices of the RPF, and others were saying that they were -- that we were cowards, and they were often attacking the positions.  And this is why they were not sure that the unit which was at Murambi, ensuring the security of the VIPs, were going to hold strong if the RPF elements came down there.  

So they were saying to themselves that it was not sure -- it wasn't certain, because this unit was the same unit guarding Agathe Uwilingiyimana and*******************, and since Agathe Uwilingiyimana had, unfortunately, died, but Twagiramungu had joined her and UNAMIR -- and everybody knows very well that *****************and the RPF were hand in hand or in cahoots.  So they were saying that those who had been ensuring the security of Agathe Uwilingiyimana and Twagiramungu were not constituting a danger.  And that is the criticism that was levelled at this unit and indirectly to the general, Ndindiliyimana, who was their leader. 
(Pages 62 to 65 by Sherri Knox)


























1700H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Let's look at the enumerated third paragraph.  And I'll read again in French. 

"It would seem that you had chosen a Tutsi officer as your personal" --
A.	I'm sorry, Mr. Prosecutor.  Where are you?  I've lost you.
Q.	I'm going to begin again.  

"It would seem that you had chosen a Tutsi officer as secretary and that your personal escort is dominated by Tutsis.  Even some members of that escort are very much bothered by this, but they don't dare speak to you about it.  However, they are not less worried about your security or theirs because of these Tutsi elements about whom they are not so sure." 

It sounds, from your suggestion to Ndindiliyimana in this letter, that you have a problem with Tutsi being part of the military.  Could you explain that for us, please, and why you think that the tone of the letter is not threatening?
A.	But, Mr. Prosecutor, I don't know whether the interpretation made to you in English -- I don't know.  Because you're saying that my counsel were not understanding what you had written in other documents earlier.  So I'm going to also tell you that you don't understand French.  

"It would seem."  Where is the threat in that phraseology?  It's French, Mr. Prosecutor.  And I understand you because you don't understand French, just like I don't understand English.  And I think you need to go and fish in different waters.  

I am not saying anything.  I'm not confirming anything at all.  I am drawing his attention to the rumour that was circulating in Murambi.  And I'm doing this because he was a friend.  It's not in order to threaten him, not at all.  To the contrary, it was because I wanted him to know and that he knows from a friend what is being said about him.  

And I have no difficulty, neither with him, nor with any Tutsi who was in his escort team.  And I tell 
him -- and you did well to begin from the beginning, where I tell him that it is my duty to provide you with these few info -- this few information on a personal basis for to you verify or for verification.  

There is no threat there at all.  It's quite the contrary of a threat.  But I know where you're drawing that from.  It's because his lawyer wanted to produce this document as a proof to show that Karemera was an extremist, whereas, Ndindiliyimana was a moderate.  But that was their defence.  It's not my defence case or theory.  
You know what you have proposed, Mr. Prosecutor.  And I'm saying this with all due respect to -- with all the respect I owe Ndindiliyimana.  You know that the Prosecution asked him to cooperate and he refused, because everyone thought that Ndindiliyimana is a moderate.  And that's why the ambassador of Belgium, Mr. Dallaire, and everybody cut themselves up into pieces to try and take him away, whereas, all the others were unable to be welcomed.  Yet he was received with open arms in Belgium at the invitation of the Belgian government.  And that's how he went there.  

And upon the -- and with the assistance of -- I don't know whether it's his friend.  But, at any case, regionalism being what it was in Rwanda, with the assistance of Kambanda and Sindikubwabo for sure, following the criticism which was levelled against him, they found a way of removing him from the scene and they appointed him ambassador to Germany without respecting the procedure.  

Because, before you appoint an ambassador, you ask the country to -- which -- he will -- is going to be accredited if they accept him as ambassador.  And he was not accepted, even despite the fact that the government had decided to appoint General Ndindiliyimana as ambassador to Bonn, who was to replace Colonel Muberuka, whom you know of.  Ndindiliyimana left with all the facilities that no one else had benefited from right up to Belgium.  

But when he was asked to go back to Kigali in order to go to serve -- to -- to -- he refused to go there when he was asked to go and serve elsewhere.  And his misery, his difficulties, recommenced, just like my friend, Ruhigira, who was accepted in Belgium.  Enoch Ruhigira and Ndindiliyimana spent miserable times in Belgium in the months following the victory of the RPF, because there had been a mistake made about them.  It had been thought that they were moderates who were going to legitimise Kagame's power when they were going to be asked to occupy posts, and they were given easy access or entry into Belgium.  Enoch almost had himself expelled, and Ndindiliyimana almost found himself on the streets, even though he had been a general.  

So do not believe that I'm saying so with pride.  But what I'm proud of regarding General Ndindiliyimana is that he was never a traitor.  He was mischaracterised.  And the Prosecutor was among those who made a mistake and asked him to cooperate.  And you know what was -- what his answer was?  You know how many years were proposed to him?  A sentence of 20 years for someone who had not committed any crime.  The proposal was, "We will sentence you for 20 years, and then we shall no longer talk about it."  

So that is the procedure adopted by the Prosecution, and -- well, let me stop here.  I believe I have answered your question.  
Q.	You've responded to the text that I read, which was only two paragraphs.  But you did correctly recount how this letter surfaced in -- in his case, referring, of course, to General Ndindiliyimana, because it was introduced and read in its entirety during his examination by his Defence counsel.  And it was raised in a way to suggest that the letter was threatening to him.  

And you've clarified your position and your understanding of what you wrote and what you meant so that this Chamber can understand your position on the matter.  And at the appropriate time, this Chamber will be able to read the entire letter in translation and make its own appreciation of whether it's threatening or not.  

But, clearly, General Ndindiliyimana, in his own trial, attempted to characterise it as a threatening letter on the 18th of June 2008, at page 33 in the English transcripts.  A portion of the transcript was included in the bundle that I circulated, 4E.  I don't have it in French.  And I'm not going to spend any more time on this issue.  But, of course, if your Defence counsel wants to return to the issue, she can do so in her redirect. 
A.	But, Counsel for the Prosecution, could you authorise me to comment on the paragraph that you deliberately skipped?  Because it is the most important paragraph, paragraph 2.  You skipped it, Counsel for the Prosecution, whereas the document you distributed earlier on, when he went to Murambi on the 22nd, that was what was alluded to in this paragraph, the document you gave me that is referring to the people who were talking behind his back.  I had thought that when you were referring to this letter you were going to put questions to me on that paragraph.  I'm surprised that you have skipped it in order to go to paragraph 3.  Let me tell you that, at the time, what I'm writing here:  

"The RPF continues to base its argument to divide the army on the ill-treatment of officers 
from -- hailing from the south, among which you are."  

So that was the threat.  General Ndindiliyimana was probably threatened because the RPF was trying to use him, and to make Rwandans believe that General Ndindiliyimana was on their side -- on the side of the RPF.  

So let me continue.  "Even if such an assertion had some basis" -- and you will understand, for me, it had no basis.  "Even if such a statement had any basis, your current position of a senior officer would not make it credible."  

If this is what you call a threat, well, then I take responsibility for it.  But I consider that this is rather a comment made by a friend who is being frank and open about problems.  And what was the problem?  The problem was that regionalism in Rwanda, Counsel for the Prosecution, was still the order of the day.  In spite of the war, in spite of the battles, people were still thinking that the country had been destroyed between the south and the north.  Since the advent of the second republic, there was -- there was disagreement and there were strong rivalries.  

The RPF had specialists and propaganda who had targeted General Ndindiliyimana, who was an elite soldier, who was very appreciated by President Habyarimana since he was his minister for youth.  He was his minister for transport and communications.  And, during the war, he was called at the president's office as minister in charge of security.  And when we formed the first government, Ndindiliyimana was the first minister -- military minister who was appointed by Habyarimana.  

General Ndindiliyimana was a -- was minister of defence in the previous government.  And if you want to know the truth, Ndindiliyimana was faced with real problems.  He had problems with Rusatira, who was one promotion before him and who was claiming that, since he was in a class that came before Ndindiliyimana, he was Ndindiliyimana's senior and Ndindiliyimana could not be his chief.  Rusatira thought at the time that he was minister of defence, since President Habyarimana was president of the republic, president of the MRND, and also chief of staff, as well as minister of defence.  

So that was too much for one individual.  And those who were his deputies considered -- and rightly so -- that they were, in fact, holding such responsibilities.  So Rusatira was identified with the 
minister of defence because he was the secretary -- he started as a secretary and then he became the director of cabinet of the ministry of defence.  And he was the one doing all the work.  

So Ndindiliyimana was probably one of the officers that were the most appreciated by 
General Habyarimana.  That was not the issue.  But, since the RPF was aware of that, it tried to say that Ndindiliyimana was the victim of regionalism.  And, during the events, it had been announced on Radio Muhabura around those dates -- I believe on the 20th or the 21st -- that Ndindiliyimana had been killed by the officers from the north.  And it was not only Ndindiliyimana.  An announcement had been made also about Colonel Rutayisire, who was his deputy at the general staff of the gendarmerie.  And mention had also been made of Colonel Alphonse Nteziryayo, who also hails from Butare.  

And it was what made the news.  It was in the headlines.  And when Ndindiliyimana refers to it in relation to the famous mission he was to carry out in Murambi, he says that he was walking hesitantly because he did not know what could happen to him.  

So I wish to draw your attention to that paragraph, which was, in fact, the real threat for him.  And that threat was due to the RPF false propaganda broadcast on Radio Muhabura, which made people doubt the commitment and faithfulness of General Ndindiliyimana to his country. 

So if you're looking for a threat, and if your learned colleague, the Defence counsel for Ndindiliyimana, had tried to identify the real threat, it would have been at that level.  But that was not what he was interested in.  What he was interested in was to describe Ndindiliyimana as a moderate and Karemera as an extremist.  Perhaps, Ndindiliyimana was not firm enough, vis-à-vis, his counsel.  But I know that he knows that I'm not an extremist, for one thing.  And, second, he knows that I am a sincere friend.  And it is because I am a true friend that I told him what I'm saying here.  He will know it.  And I will repeat it.  

But this was the reason why I said that.  If I had been called as a witness, I would have explained it in this manner.  But Lurquin didn't want me to come and explain myself, because I would have been able to explain why such a letter could have been a threat to Ndindiliyimana.  He did not do so.  

You are drawing your own conclusions and you are entitled to do so, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	Well, thank you for your very elaborate -- I think it was a 15-minute response there, Mr. Karemera.  But let me continue.  We'll go on to something else.  The Court will have the opportunity to read the letter in its entirety and decide for itself whether it was threatening or not.  

Now, you testified that you were at home on the evening of the 6th of April when Enoch Ruhigira called you -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Has it been admitted?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Has it been admitted? 
THE WITNESS: 
The director of cabinet --  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I can move it into evidence now, if that would correct the -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No.  No.  No.  That's not what I -- let's deal with it later.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Karemera, you testified -- you testified that you were at home on the evening of 6th of April when Enoch Ruhigira called you to tell you about the president's plane crash.  And you also testified that you remained at home until the next morning, that you didn't leave your home, but that the following morning you left for the first time with Mathieu Ngirumpatse to meet Colonel Bagosora.  

But, of course, you're aware that when your wife was interviewed in 1997, she told Belgian investigators that you left your home that evening and that you came back around 3 a.m. in the morning and that when she had spoken to Rose Ngirumpatse over the phone, Madam Ngirumpatse had told her that the two of you had left somewhere together.  But then, when your wife testified in this trial, she claimed that you left home on the evening of the 6th of April and you never returned home, that the next time she saw you was two or three days later at the Hôtel des Diplomates.

So what happened really?  Is it your account or your -- the first account that your wife gave or the second account that she gave here in this Chamber?  Where were you on the evening of 
the 6th of April?  
A.	First of all, I wish to make a correction, Counsel for the Prosecution.  Because when you're saying that it was an accident, I disagree with you.  It was an attack.  And you know that this is no longer in discussion.  It was an attack.  And the person who perpetrated that attack is known.  And that person is not being prosecuted; I grant it to you.  But please do not talk about a plane crash.  

You know that it was a terrorist attack against the president of Rwanda, who was elected, an attack that killed two heads of state who were coming back from a peace mission here in Tanzania.  
Counsel for the Prosecution, you're aware of that.  So please do not talk about an accident.  Do not tell me about an accident. 

Now, let me come to your question.  My wife, as any asylum seeker -- and since you're clever, you have understood that all the witnesses who come have difficulties explaining the statements they made when they were seeking asylum.  I did not seek asylum anywhere.  But I'm sufficiently clever to understand what is happening.  I am not saying that my wife lied and that it is the reason for which, since she is in Belgium, she has not yet been granted any specific status.  But the version of events she gave is a version that she repeated here in -- in the -- before the Trial Chamber.  And the version she gave in Belgium was, as you reminded us in 1999, that is to say, five years after the events.  

She had no agenda or anything -- or diary, rather, or anything.  And she was not involved in politics.  And, in addition, she is a mother and she was traumatised by the situation befalling her country, but, more specifically, because of her children's fate.  At the time we had three children.  We now have four.  My eldest daughter was ten years old.  My son was eight years old, and the other one was one.  
Q.	Is that on the issue?  

First of all, to correct you, Mr. Karemera, I'm referring not to an interview for asylum or an immigration document.  I'm referring to an interview that she -- that was organised by the parquet fédéral in Belgium.  And it was an investigation into Ndindiliyimana, so it had nothing to do with asylum or refugee status.  It was a formal investigation into General Ndindiliyimana's conduct during 1994.  That's why she was questioned.  And that's reflected on the first page of that document, which I'm sure you've already seen.  

And the issue is really where you were on the evening of the 6th of April after you learned about the 
de la chute de l'avion, or the crash, or the demise of President Habyarimana.  Because, not only did she tell Belgian investigators back in 1997 that you had left home and were not present in the home after you got the news, that's what she told this Trial Chamber just a month or two ago.  

So I can appreciate that people can make mistakes when they provide their accounts of events from the past.  But your wife gave the same information twice.  She gave it to Belgian investigators back in 1997, and she gave it to this Trial Chamber when she said that you left home after receiving a call from 
Enoch Ruhigira.  And when she testified in this trial, she said she didn't see you again until 
two or three days later at the Hôtel des Diplomates.  

So deal with the issue of where you were.  I'm not concerned so much about what your wife said.  Where were you after you heard that the plane had crashed?  
A.	First of all, let me congratulate the effort you made.  You're no longer talking about an accident.  You're talking about the crash.  I don't know what difference you make between the two.  But I wish to maintain that it was not a plane crash.  It was after the terrorist attack against our president, which led to the death of our president, as well as the president of Burundi.  

Secondly, if you're putting my spouse aside and you're asking me to answer you, I will answer you.  But if you want to compare my wife's statement with what I stated, which I'm going to repeat, then let me explain to you why my wife made such a statement in Belgium and why she repeated it here.  

First of all, let me tell you that ever since I was arrested by you, I never saw my wife and my children again.  I had to wait for her to come -- to be brought here under escort to see her again, 11 years after the fact.  

So do not try to mislead the Trial Chamber to say that I might have told her about my version of events.  You don't have any evidence to that effect, because I did not even see her in any case from the time when she was a witness.  And you know how you operate.  The only way for me to communicate with her would have been through the telephone.  The telephone conversations are recorded.  Any mail goes through a screening process at the detention centre.  So I have not tried to influence her in any way whatsoever.  

The version she gave in Belgium, as you're saying, was not during a statement given for the request for asylum status.  I believe you have never been through such a process.  She arrived in Belgium, passing through without any papers.  And during that same week, she was summoned for an examination.  And you are making a distinction between the statement she was making.  

Do you believe that my wife worked at the public prosecutor's office, like you, and that she knows what is the difference between an interview for refugee status, or asylum status?  And her examination within the framework of Ndindiliyimana trial, it was the first time she was being interviewed, and she said what she said.  And, subsequently, she also made statements.  I am telling you that those were memories five years after the fact.  

But since I was responsible for my act -- actions and the telephone calls I would take, let me tell you that after Enoch Ruhigira's telephone call, I was on the phone practically all the time, until 3 o'clock in the morning, when Mathieu Ngirumpatse told me that he had just received a telephone call from Colonel Bagosora, who had come back from a meeting with the special representative of the 
United Nations Secretary General.  But I took a shortcut.  Because, when Mathieu called me, he did not tell me that.  But the following day when we went there, he gave us all the details.  I am going to give you -- I'm giving you the full information.  
Q.	Okay.  Let me interrupt you for one second.  Let's go back to the issue that I'm trying to bring to your attention, which you seem to sidestep, which is that even when your wife testified in this trial, she said that you left home and she didn't see you again, which was consistent with what she told the 
	Belgian authorities.  

Are you suggesting to this Court now that your wife deliberately lied when she came to court to testify on your behalf?  She lied in order to protect you, and at the time that she was lying to the court, she thought that she should repeat what she told the Belgian authorities?  Is that what you're suggesting?  
A.	But if she had wanted to protect me, she would have said that I stayed at home.  She would not have said that I had left.  Because I believe she's clever enough to understand that if I left and that she did not know where I had gone -- she was worried.  That's what she stated.  But you are saying that she came to lie to protect me.  No.  She recounted here in the witness stand what she also recounted to the Belgian investigators.  And I explained to you that I influenced -- I did not influence her in any way.  And I explained to you that what she had said was based on memories five years after the events and that she had made a mistake.  

I have repeated this since we started.  You also make mistakes on a regular basis, and then you apologise.  She did not apologise, but she did not lie.  She recounted the information as she had recounted it because we had not yet seen one another and she did not know what my version of events was.  Now I'm giving you my version of events.  And if you consider that you should believe my wife rather than believe me, you are free to do so.  

But I remained at home.  I received telephone calls from everywhere.  I was answering the telephone, including the telephone call from Mathieu Ngirumpatse announcing to me that Bagosora had just had a meeting with André Booh-Booh (sic), and that we were to meet with him at the ministry of defence the following morning from 6 a.m.  And I even specified that the escort arrived shortly before that, probably in order to avoid the RPF -- the RPF soldiers who were there and could have shot at us.
Q.	Let me make things plain for you, Mr. Karemera.  I don't think your wife was -- was lying about you leaving home.  I think she was telling the truth when she -- I think the most truthful account she gave was when she spoke to Belgian investigators back in 1997.  And I think she shifted things a little bit.  And maybe she was mistaken, or maybe she was deliberate.  But the aspect of her account that's consistent, which is that you left the home after hearing the news about the president's plane crash, that portion of her evidence is truthful.  It's your evidence today that is untruthful.  

I don't think you remained at home on the evening of the 6th of April.  I think you got the news and you left home and you went somewhere else with Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  And why you're trying to conceal where you went is a mystery, because there's nothing illegal or incriminating about going out with a friend.  And you've described Mathieu Ngirumpatse as a friend. 

So the question that rises in my mind now is:  What were you doing on the evening of the 6th of April that you're so afraid to admit?  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, you, yourself, said that my wife had said that I -- that she had spoken to Mathieu's wife on the phone.  If I was at Mathieu's place, his wife was there.  Why would she have called my wife to tell her that I had left with Mathieu and that I did not go to their house?  If you're saying that your -- since your imagination is running wild and you're thinking that I left my house to go to talk with Mathieu and go to Bisesero to exterminate a few Tutsis and then come back the following morning to go to the ministry of defence -- your imagination is running wild.  I believe this is your imagination and nothing else.  And I wish you good luck with your imagination.  

Please tell me, where do you think that I went?  In your investigations, were you told that I left my home?  And I went where?  To Mathieu's house?  Is that what you were told?  Is that what Mathieu said when he came to testify in the Bagosora trial?  
Q.	Did you go out to Kanombe, to the residence -- to the president's official residence that evening, the 6th of April, after you heard about the plane crash? 
A.	Did you follow Z's trial, Protais Zigiranyirazo, the president's brother-in-law?  Did you find any trace of Karemera in the residence of President Habyarimana in Kanombe?  That is the best witness.  And I advise you to go and call him.  Please -- you have his case file -- go and check.  

If, amongst the investigations done in the Protais Zigiranyirazo trial -- please go and check in the Agathe Kanziga Habyarimana, who is being dragged in the mud and is being prosecuted.  If anywhere it is mentioned that Karemera came to bow before the remains of President Habyarimana, then I would have been glad to do that, because I'm not denying if I had been able to go there -- were I able to go there.  But I did not go there.  I was not there.  And I am not regretful, because most people would have wished to accompany him in dignity, and we were unable to do so.  We were unable to do so.  

I'm very sure that wherever he is -- because Habyarimana was a practicing Christian.  Wherever he is, I'm convinced that he is in heaven, and he is seeing me being in the process of defending the truth, Mr. Prosecutor.  And he is proud of me.  Habyarimana is proud of me.  I'm telling you where he is.  Because he and I, we believed in someone who is superior than what you -- you are trying to defend.  And that is a count of truth, Mr. Prosecutor.  

May Habyarimana rest in peace, wherever he is.  He is proud of me.  I was his adviser.  I was his minister.  I was unable to go and bow before his remains.  But this makes me sad.  And this is maybe an opportunity for me to, once again, bow -- once again, in the memory of the victims of the Rwandan tragedy, including His Excellency Juvénal Habyarimana.  

Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  You have allowed me to carry out a -- a loyal task and -- because I am like the son of Habyarimana.  And I will never deny -- whatever may happen, I will not be a traitor.  And who -- however -- now they are in hiding -- or, rather you are pushing them.  Let me tell you, you are pushing them to hide themselves, because you know Habyarimana did not plan his assassination.  Because you know if he had done so, it would have been with Munyazesa, with Rusatira, with whom he would have done that.  And you know that those were his right-hand men.  

And I was -- I was unconditional, and I remain that.  And I want the world to know this, that -- Kagame should know this:  Habyarimana is dead and unjustly so because he was a man of peace.  He was a man of peace, Mr. Prosecutor.  You were young in relation to him.  You don't know that.  You didn't know him.  I knew him.  I worked with him.  And I'm crying.  I'm mourning his death because it was an unjust death.  And people continue to say that it was his wife, the mother of his children, mother of eight children -- it is being said that it is the mother of his children who killed him.  The world is unjust.  And -- but God is great.

1735H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Did you have any contact with his widow, Madam Habyarimana, before she left on the 9th of April? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
	Please, could the Prosecutor repeat what he stated. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Did you have any contact with Madam Habyarimana, the widow of Juvénal Habyarimana, before she left Rwanda on the 9th of April? 
A.	You want to say that she came to my place in Kicukiro?  Because I have told you that I wasn't in Kanombe.  Now you are saying that we were in touch.  On the 8th -- on the 7th we were at the ministry of defence.  On the 8th we were also at the ministry of defence to set up the government that you do not like.  On the 9th was the day of the swearing in.  I told the Chamber that on the 8th General Gatsinzi, who was chief of general staff, told us go back home.  So you want to say that Madam Agathe Uwilingiyimana -- no, I'm sorry -- Agathe Habyarimana Kanziga came to see me at my home in Kicukiro.  Or do you say that he came to see -- you're asking me questions to know whether I met her.  I told you I was unable to go and bow before the remains of the president.  And you are telling me, "Did you meet his wife?"  So does that mean that she came to see me?  You have a logic which disgusts me. 
Q.	I think my suggestion to you, or actually my question, Mr. Karemera, was quite straightforward and quite direct.  Did you have any contact, by telephone or by any other means, with Madam Habyarimana before she left the country? 
A.	No.  No. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, it's 20 to 6 now.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  Your Honour, this is a good time to break.  I would make an application to have the first half of the morning session tomorrow to complete my line of questioning.  My request, or my application, to the Chamber is that I be allowed to complete my cross-examination tomorrow morning.  

We took an hour's break this afternoon.  We left the courtroom at quarter to four and came back 
quarter to -- I'm sorry -- at quarter to four and came back, I believe, an hour later.  We had one question from Mr. Karemera, which took a whole 45 minutes to get a response.  We had a 20-minute colloquy with the Defence about an interview report, which was quite obvious on its face.  And under the circumstances, I'm suggesting or I'm asking the Court to allow me to finish the line of questioning that I have begun that has been interrupted now because we have run out of time for the day.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President --
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will continue this tomorrow morning.  We have to rise now.  We have to rise now.  We also make commitments, you know.  We have to rise now.  We will take our adjournment now.
