P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding; Judge Emile Francis Short; and Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, the 28th of June 2006, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera, et al., Case Number ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

And -- oh, appearances this morning.  Is there any development that needs to be noted on the record? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I think the most important development is the arrival of Ms. Diagne-Mbaye to the Karemera team, so I'm sure we all welcome her.  

As far as Mr. Nzirorera's presence is concerned, he said once again he's not going to come today, in solidarity with some of the other Accused, who are also not appearing today, for the first time, but he will be back tomorrow.  And he allows me to proceed in his absence. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.  

Ms. Diagne-Mbaye. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  Good morning, the Office of the Prosecutor.  

I'm happy to be once again with you and also to tell you, regarding my client, Édouard Karemera, in solidarity with his fellow detainees, he will not be here today.  But we'd like to inform you that tomorrow things should return to normal.  

Thank you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  Good morning, everybody.  

I am going to say exactly the same thing for my client, who is absent from the courtroom today, in solidarity with the other Accused.  And, in principle, tomorrow he ought to be present to participate in the debate.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Ms. Diagne-Mbaye, we would just like to welcome you back to the hearing, and we hope that your tour of duty on this occasion will be satisfactory to you.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Merci.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we are going to recommence your testimony.  I remind you that you are still on the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began.  

And Mr. Robinson will continue his examination. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  And if the witness could be shown document number 3 in my packet of exhibits.  

While he's doing -- while that's being done, I want to thank Judge Kam for making the extra effort to appear with us today.  
WITNESS XBM,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (Continued) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness XBM, (Kinyarwanda spoken).  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  All is well. 
Q.	At the end of the day on Monday, you told us that you had never made a statement to 
	Leonard Mukeshimana, L-E-O-N-A-R-D M-U-K-E-S-H-I-M-A-N-A, and I've had placed in front of you a document which appears to be a statement you made on the 8th of June 1995 to Leonard Mukeshimana on behalf of the prosecutor's office in Gisenyi.  Do you recognise that document that has been put before you? 
A.	Could you give me some time to enable me to have a look at the document?  I would like to make sure that the person you referred to is the one whose name appears in the document and if, indeed, the content of the document reflects what I declared.  

I have just gone through the whole statement, and I note that the content of said statement agrees with what I stated.  I think that the officers from the public prosecutor's office are complementary.  Mukeshimana, Leonard, was an assistant prosecutor.  I think that the person who put questions to me was acting in his name.  But I notice that the content of the statement is a reflection of what I said.  There were no major additions.  
Q.	And is that your signature at the bottom of the statement? 
A.	That is correct.  I told you that I acknowledge the content of the statement.  If I acknowledge the statement, it is that the signature accompanying the statement is my own.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would offer this exhibit as D. NZ159, under seal.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.
 (Exhibit No. D. NZ159 admitted, under seal) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, are the contents of this statement true? 
A.	Yes.  I note that the content of the statement is correct.  I told you the role I played during the genocide, and I note that this statement proves what I told you when I was here with you the last time.  Therefore, it's obvious from this document that I was present at the scene of the crime but that I did not play any role in the commission of the crimes.  And I think that the person who disclosed this statement to you gave you sufficient explanations on it.  
Q.	Looking at the second question in the statement, you were asked, "How can you plead not guilty when your elder brother," and it gives his name, which I won't repeat here, "has already said that, after the murder of the victim at the residence and his burial, he saw you among people who were at the crime scene?"  And your answer is that your elder brother was wrongly accusing you.  Did you give that answer? 
A.	Indeed, I gave such an answer because my brother could not say anything that was not right or correct with respect to me.  

And regarding what happened during the period I referred to, there was an attempt to extort statements from people.  I can refer you to the first statement in which you do not see the name of the person who collected the statement, which statement, for me, was obtained under torture.  You may have noticed that, in order to get out of a scrape, in order to escape torture, everyone had to confess.  And that answer is to be found in the statement I have before me and is proof that I did not make a confession, because I recognised having perpetrated the acts I was accused of in an attempt to save my life, given that before other authorities I would have a chance to explain what actually happened.  Therefore, I categorise my elder brother's statement in that group.  He made that statement in order to save his own life.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, could you give us just a moment, please?  

Mr. Robinson, you may continue.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness XBM, looking at the fourth question that you were asked, it says, "Do you mean he did not find you on the crime scene?"  And you answered, "When I arrived at the crime scene, the victim was already dead, and I did not even find this," and it gives the name of your elder brother, "who is accusing me."  Was that true? 
A.	The question put to me had hidden malice on the part of the accusers.  It was a trick question.  The investigator had a specific intent because he wanted to prove to me that my elder brother had seen me commit the crime.  He asked me a trick question.  I gave him a trick answer, because the investigator was trying to tell me that there were people accusing me, including my elder brother.  

If you were to show me a statement by my elder brother in which he accuses me, I could respond to you.  Otherwise, the wording of question four is linked to the tricks used by the investigators in their attempts to implicate the person they're investigating.  

In short, I answered the question in the way it was put to me.  I was asked a trick question.  I gave a trick answer.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, you can continue. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness XBM, in the answer to that question, you have two elements:  The first, you said, "When I arrived at the crime scene, the victim was already dead."  And the second, you said, "I did not even find my elder brother, who is accusing me."  

So I want to just take those two things separately.  When you said, "When I arrived at the crime scene, the victim was already dead"; was that the truth? 
A.	It is true that, upon my arrival, the victim had already been killed.  No one can contradict me, because I was present at the site, and when I arrived, that is how the situation was.  

And, returning to the question that was put to me, the objective was not to know who was at the scene of a crime.  The question was intended to identify the perpetrators of the crime.  And, in this vein, I answered the question. 

I am not sure if the fact that I said this or that or -- or, that we were in such-and-such a place could in any way save me.  I answered the question put to me, but I noticed that what I was saying was not enough to satisfy the investigators.  And the investigators were forced to ask other people questions, that is, persons who were at the scene.  As far as I know, for me, what I am saying here is correct.  
Q.	Okay.  Well, I want to be clear on that because you've told us now that, when you said that when you arrived at the crime scene the victim was already dead, that that was a true statement, right? 
A.	What do you expect me to say?  That is my answer, unless you have other information that differs from what I am giving you. 
Q.	Well, I -- I do have other information, and that's why I'm -- wanted to make sure of your answer.  So I'm going to be asked that you be shown document number 7 in the packet of material.  

Now, Witness XBM, what's been placed in front of you appears to be another statement that you made to the Rwandan authorities, and it bears your -- it looks like it bears your signature on the bottom.  So why don't you take a minute to read that, and let me know when you have done so.  
A.	I have read through the document.  I am not the author of this document.  I am not the author of this document.  I did not sign this statement.  In fact, I can write well enough.  I cannot say that this signature on this document is mine.  It is, indeed, not my signature, so I don't see why or how somebody would draft a statement of this nature and try to ascribe it to me.  Even if the content of the document is not of a nature as to incriminate me, let me say that I am not the author of this document.  

You see, when someone has a case file, people may try to introduce various documents into the file in order to incriminate the suspected individual.  Although this document does not incriminate me, let me say that I am not the author of this document.  It does resemble the first document we looked at in that it does not state the person who took down the statement.  

And, furthermore, as I have already said, I am not the author of this document.  I have seen another document which was written in my own hand, although I have not yet read it, but it is different from this one.  I know how to write, and I don't need anybody to help me or to assist me in writing down anything on my behalf.  

In a nutshell, therefore, I do not know under what circumstances this document was drawn up. 
Q.	Have you ever seen this document before? 
A.	If I don't know this document, how could I have seen it elsewhere?  I only saw it here today.  
Q.	Now, in this document it states -- well, first of all, the document has your name at the bottom and a signature next to it, correct? 
A.	I have told you that everybody knows my name.  Even you, you have already seen my name on this document.  You are not my neighbour, yet you know my name because you have seen it on this document today.  I cannot stop anybody from writing anything they want to write.  I, for example, can write down your name and attempt to imitate your signature.  

By the way, let me say that I am -- the content of the document, in itself, is not very incriminating, but I do not want to acknowledge things which I did not do.  
Q.	Okay.  Well, let's -- in the content of this document, it describes the murder of the person who is listed in that piece of paper, D. NZ157, and it says that -- and this is in the third paragraph that I'm reading -- that "Where I reached the place he was staying in, I found a big number of assailants who have encircled him.  He was laying on the ground.  A certain Jean-Damascène Banzirikiri (phonetic) was pulling him in order to throw him in the toilets."  And it said -- then it gives the name of the victim -- "grabbed the hoe Banzikiri (sic) was holding and told him he was still alive, in these words, 'Don't harm me.  I am still alive.  We used to keep cattle together.'  And so Banzikiri took immediately his machete because he was coming from the garden, and tried to slash (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept funder separate cover) --" excuse me, "tried to slash the victim --" 
MR. ROBINSON:
If we could redact that, what I just said, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The name is redacted. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	"-- claiming an Inyenzi he thought was dead was about to kill him." 

And then you describe how your elder brother snatched the machete and ran away with it:  "And so Banzirikiri took a club and inflicted several strikes to the victim until he died."  

And then on the bottom, you say that -- well, the person who wrote this says that "I recognise the offence of having been present at the crime scene where the victim has been killed without providing any assistance to him."  And you beg -- the person begs pardon to God, the Rwandan government, and all Rwandans.  

And you're telling us that this is not your statement; is that correct? 
A.	I have already explained to you that, even if I was going to be paid a salary for things which I did not do, I will not take that salary.  From what you have just said in relation to this document, it is obvious that I did not play any part whatsoever in the killing of that individual.  

Furthermore, there is no reason for asking for forgiveness because any witness -- or, any person who was part of a crime does not have to ask for pardon as if they had been the author -- or, the perpetrator of the crime.  So the issue is not very clear.  

I -- I think that the manner in which these documents have been pieced together, from the first page to the last, is rather disjointed, and I do not acknowledge authorship of any document, even if it does not incriminate me.  I have read the document.  It is in Kinyarwanda.  It does not incriminate me, but I have told you that I have read through it.  I am not its author, and I do not know the author of this document. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would ask that that document be marked as ID. NZ30. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification. 
MR. ROBINSON:
And now if the witness can be shown number 8 in my packet of exhibits.  

Mr. President, this document exists in Kinyarwanda, French, and English.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness XBM, what has just been placed in front of you is a record of confession, guilty plea, and asking for forgiveness in the Rwandan court in Gisenyi.  Do you recognise that? 
A.	I will need some time to look at the document.  
Q.	You could take your time.  I would point out to you, however, that when we met, before you gave your testimony, and I offered to discuss with you your testimony, I was prepared to show you these documents at that time so that you could have read them and could have saved us some time in court.  But you were dissuaded from doing that by Mr. Webster, and it's unfortunate that we could not have saved the time during that meeting.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, I have a very different recollection of that encounter, and perhaps -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. -- Mr. -- Mr. Webster, please.  It is not necessary to (inaudible).  We have already heard both of your (unintelligible) about this meeting. 
MR. WEBSTER:
The witness is on the stand, Your Honour -- 

MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)...no, no, no, we have already explained our position.  We -- we are not interested in making an assessment of what transpired.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, I don't think you should have raised this issue in view of what we said earlier about this matter.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I understand.  
THE WITNESS:
Well, I do recognise this document, but regarding what you have just said in relation to the opportunity which you may have given me -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping) 
THE WITNESS:
-- earlier on, I do understand that you strayed beyond the limits -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are not permitting questions to be asked about that meeting, so please address the questions concerning our trial now.  
Mr. Robinson, please continue.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness XBM, is this a document which pertains to your guilty plea and confession in Rwanda?  
A.	As I have already explained previously, and I believe you are not the only person present here, I told you already that Rwandans who were under detention, or who were witnesses of some events in 1994, I said that those people had a way of explaining their experiences. 

Now, as far as I am concerned, I provided explanations relating to the events I witnessed, or I became aware of, but, you see, when someone explains events, that person may not be aware of what may have transpired one hour or ten minutes prior to the time at which his own testimony begins.  Therefore, one only can testify from the time relating to the events that one witnessed with one's own eyes. 

Briefly speaking, therefore, the content of this document relating to my confession and my plea of guilty remains valid because you would note that, even here, I have not confessed having been party to any killing, and the prosecutor's office in Rwanda confirms this position through this document.  
So what, then, is your question, Counsel, relating to this document?  
Q.	Is this your confession? 
A.	That was a mere formality under the circumstances prevailing at the time.  That was the main objective, but, as you can see, this document contains a testimony, not a confession.  And I believe that those who drafted the document understand the document better and may be able to answer your question better.  Now, I may have been at a location where something happened, and I provided my explanations as to what transpired.  Then the prosecutor's office would look into my statement in order to determine whether what I was saying did dovetail with the -- or, the findings of the investigation that had been conducted in my case.  And on the basis of that analysis, they would be able to assess my statement and weight it accordingly.  It is under those circumstances that this document was drafted.  

And you will see that, at the end of the document, the prosecutor's office said that my explanations did tally with the events I was blamed for.  That should be your understanding of this document.  But, as you can see clearly in the document, there is no reference to my having committed any murder of any nature whatsoever.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would offer this document as Exhibit D. NZ160A for the Kinyarwandan, 160B for the French, and 160C for the English, all under seal.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.
 (Exhibit Nos. D. NZ160A, D. NZ160B, and D. NZ160C  admitted, under seal) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness XBM, I want to turn your attention to the page of this document that contains your explanation of what happened at this event, and that's page 5 of the document.  So there is a handwritten paragraph that I'm going to read, and I'm going to ask you if, in fact, that's correct.  It says that "On 8 April at 12 noon, Rukira --" that's R-U-K-I-R-A, "-- and Gakuru --" G-A-K-U-R-U, "-- arrived home from the border, saying that an Inkotanyi, who was hiding in ************'s house --" that's ************-'s (sic) "-- from where he was refusing to come out, had been discovered.  Many people rushed to see the said Inkotanyi.  When it had stopped raining, I also followed them.  
"When I arrived at the scene, I saw a large crowd around someone who was lying on the ground.  Banziniki --" that's B-A-N-Z-I-N-I-K-I "-- then emerged from the crowd and grabbed the leg of the victim in order to throw the body into a latrine.  The victim told him that he was still alive.  That was when Banzariki (sic) took a machete to cut him to pieces, but my elder brother snatched it away from his hands.  Banzariki then took a club and struck the victim several times.  He hit him nine times with the club before throwing his body into the latrine.  Then he took a hoe and covered the latrine with soil, but the victim was still alive because he was moving.  After burying him alive, he selected an ox and left the other two cows for those people who accommodated the victim at the border."  
Now, was that your statement? 
(Pages 1 to 9 by Ann Burum)

1000H 
THE WITNESS:
Yes that indeed was my statement, but I would like to know what your problem. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	My problem is that statement is virtually identical to the statement you denied being the author of in another exhibit, D. NZ, Exhibit 30.  How do you explain that? 
A.	Well as I told you earlier on, I will not acknowledge what I did not say.  If I have said that this one is my statement it is, indeed, my statement, and I signed it.  Although the document before me bears no signature, I am still ready to acknowledge it as being my statement.  The other document you showed me did bear a signature, but I did not recognise that document.  So I cannot confess to something I did not do.  And in both documents there is no incriminating factor, whereas your thesis is that I am a criminal. 
Q.	My second problem is that you testified under oath, both on Monday and this morning, that the victim was already dead at the time you arrived.  Yet in your statement that we have just looked at, you clearly indicate that the victim was still alive.  Would you like to explain that? 
A.	I believe that the statement does not say that at the time of my arrival the body -- or the person was already buried, that is one thing.  The person was not yet buried.  Now, if I said that I saw his body, that doesn't mean that he was already buried.  

Secondly, the statement -- you see, when one is being questioned the interviewer is seeking to obtain a number of things from the interviewee.  You may want to note that by the time I got to the site of the crime, or the scene of the crime I arrived alone; whereas there were other persons who were already at the scene.  So I arrived after those other persons.  

When one is making a statement, one narrates all what one saw, witnessed or heard, and that is what amounts to the emergence of the truth.  I was an eyewitness and only to a few events.  Some of the information was narrated to me by those who were present at the time some of the things were happening.  So my statement includes what I saw with my own eyes and what I was told by others.  

When I got to the scene, those who were there explained everything to me because they had no reason for which to hide any information from me.  And that is why, in my statement, I referred to what I saw with my own eyes and what I was told. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, have we exhausted this issue as of yet?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Sorry, Mr. President?  

MR. PRESIDENT:
We have had the different versions of the witness and we have had his explanation.  Is there much to be gained from continuing on this particular line?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I can wrap up this particular line of questioning. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So Witness XBM, we have discussed a crime in which you confessed to committing in 1995; you subsequently denied committing the crime later in 1995.  And then in 2003 you made a confession and a guilty plea to the crime of murder and genocide; is that correct? 
A.	I would like to provide some further explanation but I am sure that the President of the Trial Chamber has asked you to put questions to me in order to clarify this matter.  Briefly speaking, let me say, first of all, that you cannot speak exhaustively of what happened in Rwanda because you are not a Rwandan.  All you work with is information that has been provided to you, but you know that much is lost in translation because translating is often incomplete.  

Now even through people may have told you what happened, it cannot be exhaustive.  You have conducted investigations to contradict what I have said.  I know that the prosecutor's office in Rwanda conducted its investigations, and you are seeking to contradict all of that.  I told you that by the time I got to the scene the person had been killed and was being buried.  I have told you the circumstances under which I got to that place.  I have told you that I spent nine years in prison for that issue.

What I simply did was to tell the truth for the authorities to determine whether I should be convicted or acquitted.  So I told the state officials the full and the whole truth.  And I told them exactly what I had experienced at the crime scene.  If there was anything that I should be convicted of, it is simply my presence at that crime scene.  And I'm ready to take punishment for that.  

And by the way, I was not the only person present at the crime scene but they were not convicted for that crime simply because they were present at the scene.  All I know is that somebody, unfortunately, was killed.  But one cannot be guilty simply for being present at the crime scene.  So this is the position that the government, at the time, may have taken.  But I believe that each individual is liable to answer for their own actions.  It is our duty to tell everything.  And if the government of the day is convinced that the person testifying deserves some punishment, then that person is punished.  But if it is of the opinion that the person should be acquitted, then the person is acquitted.  

So my question then is what is it that I did or what is it that the government did not do?  I have told the whole story.  I have been clear enough stating that I did not play any role in the killing of that victim.  This appears in all of the statements.  There is no reference in any of the statements that I am the one who killed the victim.  So I hope that we are not here the pry into my past.  There are people in Rwanda who were aware of my past, who knew me from the time I was young up to this day.  And they know very well how things transpired from the beginning to the end.  They know how I spent time in jail and they know I was released.  

Now you, who were not even in Rwanda at the time, you seem to be more concerned about these things than those who were present.  Well, that is your business.  And I believe that you are just wasting the Court's time, except you have other interests in the background.  So I believe we should not dwell too much on these things that are not important because they do not in any way assist your client.  
Q.	Well, Witness XBM, these are matters that relate to your credibility.  And we have seen that you     made -- in one statement in which you said that you committed the murder.  You made another statement which said you didn't commit the murder.  You told us under oath that you weren't present when the victim was killed; and you made statements in Rwanda so that you were present when the victim was killed.  Now you have attributed that to translation, or to the circumstances in Rwanda.  

And I want to read to you from the interview that you gave to the prosecutor on the 26th and             27th of February 2003, and I'm reading on page 13 in the English version, in the very first paragraph.  And it says that, "Around 1 p.m., I went home.  I went around my secteur to check on the situation.  I went to -- and then you give the name of the cellule -- "and I saw Banziriyiki," and spelt here B-A-N-Z-I-R-I-Y-I-K-I, "and Sebacumga" spelt here S-E-B-A-M-U-M -- excuse me S-E-B-A-C-U-M-G-A "hitting a Tutsi named --" and then you have the name of the victim -- "with clubs."  

So the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICTY has also recorded you saying that you were present at the time the victim was being hit by clubs, and that you saw it.  Now, what is your explanation for that? 
A.	Regarding the time, first of all, I would like us to begin with the time that you mentioned.  I would like to point out that even now I do not have a wristwatch so that I cannot even tell you what time it is now.  As you know one uses a watch to know exactly what time it is.  I had no watch.  

Secondly, you mentioned the names of those two people, and I said to you in Rwanda there are two ways of expressing one's self, or telling a story.  One may recount events one witnessed personally, and things one was told.  As you have seen, some people said they saw me on the scene of the crime.  I believe you understand that one may recount either what one witnessed with one's own eyes or what was reported to one.  What I did was tell all, so that people would understand what happened.

You are saying I am lying.  I see that you are well versed in the subject.  Like everyone else here you are a man of the law.  And you are, therefore, well aware that when investigations are conducted on you, you have to explain yourself.  You cannot explain everything when you are being interrogated.  You cannot tell the story from A to Z, but as the case advances you can explain yourself.  So it is not something that is done in one hour or a day and then concluded, other things may be added.  

I could give you an example.  For instance, what I am telling you now is not exhaustive, there will be a follow up.  
Q.	Well, Witness, when you signed this statement to the Office of the Prosecutor, and you represented that you saw these two individuals hitting the victim with clubs, are you now telling us that you did not see that, in fact, with your own eyes? 
A.	If that is the question on your mind, I would like to tell you that when I arrived they were burying that person, so that we could not go and ask the victim, or speak to the victim.  Only I can tell you what happened.  If you are not satisfied, there is nothing I can do about it.  I just know that that person was killed by those two persons.  Unless you are going to bring other people to challenge me -- I see you have my case file, and I wonder why you did not try to get hold of those two people so that you could challenge me with them. 
Q.	Well, Witness XBM, what I am challenging you with now is the fact that you told the Prosecutor that you saw something that you didn't really see; isn't that correct? 
A.	Counsel, you ought -- we ought to try to understand one another.  Let me give you an example; if, for instance, we were asked about everything that had been said here today there are people who would not be in a position to recount it exactly the same way.  Therefore, I think what you ought to have done was ask me if, for example, I said that those people had not killed that person then you would be right in saying that I am lying.  But what I said, what was noted by the public prosecution office is the same thing, that those individuals killed that person.  If you read the documents carefully you will realise that there is no mention that I am a criminal, that I played a role.  So I wonder what is your problem?   
Q.	Well my problem, XBM, is that you have given testimony about many things you claim to have seen, Anatole Nsengiyumva at Mugende university, meetings of Mr. Barayagwiza at the stonelaying,      Mount Muhe, many other  things that you told us that you saw yourself.  And now we are finding out that when you tell the Prosecutor you saw something with your own eyes you don't really mean that; you mean, maybe you heard it from somebody else.  

So I'm asking you, when you told the Prosecutor in February of 19 -- of 2003 that "I saw these two people hitting a Tutsi named --" and you give the name of the victim, was that true? 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, you have asked this question several times.  Whether the explanation given by the witness is acceptable or not, it is a matter for the Bench.  Don't you think it is time you move on from this particular incident as to whether he was present and saw some people hit the victim, or whether he participated in the -- or whether he was not present when the victim was killed?  

MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, I was feeling that I wasn't getting a direct answer, that he was talking around the question.  I was trying to get the answer on the record.  But if you think that that is not necessary, then I could move on to another question. 
JUDGE SHORT:
I think you could. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness XBM, I want to read to you your testimony under oath from the trial of Colonel Bagosora and Anatole Nsengiyumva, on the 14th of July 2003, on page 44.  And you were asked by the Prosecutor, Mr. Rashid, "What was the ethnic group of the victim?" And you answered, "He was Tutsi."

And then you were asked, "And where was the victim at that point?  Where did you see him?"  And you said, "He was being stretch out -- he was stretched out on the ground.  He was being whipped with clubs.  He was being hit with clubs."  

Question:  "And who was hitting him?"  Answer:  "A certain Banziriyiki, Jean Damscéne."

So, did you not testify, under oath, to another trial in this very building to having seen something that you actually never saw? 
A.	But, Counsel, I see that it is very difficult to convince you.  You, it seems, want to dwell on this point, the fact that Banziriyiki was hitting him with a club.  I never told you that I did not find that person hitting him, but before that, something else had happened which was reported to me.  

Banziriyiki's name is featured on almost every page of the statement.  Do not dwell on it, Mr. Robinson.  I do not understand why you are refusing to understand me.  I did not lie when I said that when I saw him Banziriyiki was hitting him.  That is what I said in the public prosecutor's office, and it is record in a document that Banziriyiki was hitting him.  You cannot keep hammering on about that.  I never said that I had not seen them.  I told you that by the time I arrived the victim had not yet been buried, he had just been killed.  It is Banziriyiki who was hitting him.  If you had Banziriyiki's statement before you, you would be in a position to know what happened. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, would you like to take the mid-morning break at this time?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, are you going to be putting this document into evidence?  

MR. ROBINSON: 
I am, yes, the contradiction I will bring it in French and English. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see the thing is, the inconsistencies have been demonstrated.  We have the witness's explanations.  You've spent a lot of time on that.  Don't you think you have exhausted the issue?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, I do.  I am finished with that issue. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take the mid-morning break now. 
(Court recessed from 1032H to 1128H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can continue now. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness XBM, when you gave your confession and offered your plea of guilty on the ************************2003, you did so because you believed that you could be released, correct? 
A.	I did not do anything special, I did what I was supposed to do and I declared what I was supposed to declare. 
Q.	And you understood by doing that, you would be making it possible for you to be released under the laws that were then in effect in Rwanda? 
A.	But you, rather, as a legal expert, what did the government do for me in particular?  What did the government grant me that I did not deserve, according to you?  
Q.	Well according to my information, you were released eight days after you made your confession after having been in prison for almost nine years.  So, did you make your confession and plea of guilty so that you could be released? 
A.	Quite simply, I told the truth.  It was not a matter that related to me directly, on the contrary.  The government wanted all of those detained to tell the truth.  It is not a favour that was granted to me as an individual.  I am just a citizen, and the government did what it had to do, as it did for other citizens.  The fact that the government sought to know the truth, and that is what I did.  If you think I hold any information other than what I declared, just prove it, and if I had -- I had forgotten to say anything. 
Q.	Were you, in fact, released on the ***************2003? 
A.	I was released on the*******************. 
Q.	And did you then go to a solidarity camp at Mudende university grounds? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And at that solidarity camp, did you have re-education concerning the genocide in Rwanda? 
A.	Again, my answer to you is, yes. 
Q.	And it was at that solidarity camp that the investigators from the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICTR found you and interviewed you on the 26th and 27th of February 2003, correct? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And can you tell us how it was that you came to the attention of the Prosecutors?  How did they know to contact you as opposed to the other residents of the solidarity camp. 
A.	I saw the investigators from the Prosecution office arrive at the place where I was.  They told me that they had information to obtain from me because they had learned from others that I had certain things to tell them about the reprehensible acts committed by government officials of the previous government. 
Q.	And who was it that you had told that you had information about these reprehensible acts, was it the prosecuting authorities in Gisenyi? 
A.	To answer you, I would like to ask you not to dwell on this matter because I have the impression that it is your habit.  Generally no one invites investigators to meet with them.  Quite simply, I saw the investigators arrive.  They asked me questions.  I was, moreover, surprised.  But since I knew that I had some information on the events I had experienced, I decided to talk to them.  I did not ask them why they had come to see me; who had told them where I was.  

I think you know the investigators; it is likely their names are to be found in my statement.  Actually, I think they should be asked that question. 
Q.	Who had you told prior to meeting the investigators that you had information about the reprehensible acts of authorities during the genocide? 
A.	I told you that this is a question you should have asked the investigators.  I saw them come to the place where I was. 
Q.	So my question to you was not who told the investigators about you, but who you had told that you had information about reprehensible acts during the genocide? 
A.	I have the impression that again you are going to dwell on this issue for hours; and for me, that would be a waste of time.  This is what I can tell you, I cannot answer in place of those other people.  If you cannot get a hold of the investigators, you can tell me, and I will tell you that this is not a question you should be asking.  You are asking me to explain how the investigators came to find me.  I do not know who told them.  As a matter of fact, they were not supposed to know where I was.  You should be asking this question to the investigators.  You are asking me a question that you ought to be putting to others.  I think you are going overboard. 
Q.	Prior to the 26th of February 2003, had you told any person in authority of the government of Rwanda, including prosecutors, or their employees, members of the judiciary or their employees, about any information you had concerning reprehensible acts of authorities during the genocide? 
A.	I would like you to understand me once and for all.  The fact that I met judicial officers or other authorities or officials did not in any way add or subtract from the information that I held.  When I decided to testify, no one suggested I do it.  It was my own initiative to decide to provide information, because I noticed that it could be useful, especially because many people do not understand a number of things regarding what happened in 1994.  It is true that some officials took part in the events.  Therefore there was a problem, if a citizen or several citizens were to be jailed for acts committed by the officials.  It was therefore obvious that the role of the officials had to be known, because if the officials had not supported the massacres they would not have taken place.  At least those officials would have condemned the reprehensible acts committed.  Unfortunately that did not happen.  

In fact, the officials supported the massacres, and encouraged members of the population to take part in the massacres.  When the officials lost the war, they fled and members of the public were forced to answer for the officials.  Therefore, there was no reason to keep the secret, or remain silent about the officials who had driven the public to commit reprehensible acts, namely, the massacres.  
Q.	And to whom had you made known these reprehensible acts prior to meeting with the ICTR investigators on the 26th of February 2003? 
A.	As for the circumferences under which I provided the information, I can tell you that I did not speak to anyone about the information; but if you have been observant, if you have been following the events in Rwanda, all that was done was with full knowledge of everyone, massacres were committed in broad daylight, because the officials, the authorities supported the massacres.  

	Now, as for the meeting with the people that you alluded to, it is possible that people who saw me in certain places showed a willingness to say something to the Tribunal, in particular, the investigators.  Therefore, I think the investigators cited my name as I cite the names of other people.  The people the investigators met might have mentioned my name, because I myself mentioned some names.  And you will find the names of those persons in my statement. 
Q.	So, can we agree that the first time that you recounted the events of 1993 and 1994 concerning the actions of authorities was not until the 26th of February 2003, some nine or ten years later? 
A.	I grant it, it is true because that is when I was meant to answer questions about the events, and besides it was on that occasion that that sort of question was put to me. 
Q.	Now, you have told us that you were****************************************************, correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And you testified that you became **************in 1991 and that you stopped being ******************in 1992; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And you told us that in 1992, you joined the CDR party from -- as a result of coercion; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Now on the 26th and 27th of February of 2003, you told the prosecute -- the investigators that you had been *************************from 1991 all the way through 1994; did you not? 
A.	I would like to ask you not to continue conflating issues.  I would like to ask you to orient your questions precisely.  As for the fact that I was***********************, that is correct, I was from 1991 until 1992.  In 1992, there was a dispute to have -- gain members.  Force was also used, and some people even lost their life, in the process, if it was noticed that someone enjoyed or was popular, that person could       be -- could be someone who could get members.  So members of the CDR and MRND came to recruit me.  However, I was obliged to join under beatings.  I was seriously beaten before I accepted their proposal, and this happened in broad daylight, in front of everyone.  

	I was grabbed -- rather my MDR membership cards, ***************************************************, were grabbed from me.  And some MDR members who were with me, who were carrying the same type of cards, were beaten up as well.  For my security, I did not officially continue to campaign on behalf of my party.  Deep down I still had my party.  I could also engage in discussions about party activities with people who had the same views, but in secret, in hiding, because there was a need to avoid -- again, being attacked or being killed.

Mr. Robinson, I would like to explain, if you carefully followed events in Rwanda, I know that I am not the first to tell you, and you will have other witnesses.  It seems to me you are a good lawyer who has had experience in investigating.  With the advent of multiparty politics, in order for someone to leave Gisenyi and get into Kigali, one could not hold the MRND membership card in the same way for someone who came from Gitarama.  It was forbidden to enter Gisenyi préfecture holding a MDR membership card or PL or PSD.  It was even necessary for one to be armed with three different types of membership cards, even four.  

When you were -- when you had problems, when you encountered problems, if you came across youth gathered in a particular spot, youths who were partisans of a certain party, in order to get passed those youth, you were obliged to show them the membership card of the party those youths belonged to.  It was the only way of being allowed to go on one's way.  A few metres away if you came across another group of youths, you would display yet another membership card in order to continue on your way.  The situation, Mr. Robinson, had deteriorated.  And you may obtain information from other people.  I am not lying to you.   I am telling the truth.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if the witness could be shown his statement in French of the 26th and                            27th of February 2003.  I have a copy here.  I would like to direct his attention to part of that. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness XBM, on page two of that statement, number 13, isn't it true that it indicates that you were ********************************************for the period 1991 through 1994, and that you signed that page on the bottom, certifying that what was contained there was accurate? 
A.	That is true, Counsel.  It is true that I was***********************.  It is true that at one point I stopped campaigning for that party because of the security issue that had arisen for me.  As for******************* **********, no one took my place and no one in my secteur would tell you that I was replaced.  I desisted from the campaigning activities on behalf of the party, but that did not stop me from continuing to be an activist of the party; although you would understand, obviously, I was not a very important activist.  

I did not have the strength to do my work because there were a lot of people discouraging me, and these people benefited from government support.  Please understand it as I say it.  You are someone in my opinion that has a certain understanding.  And, therefore, I do not understand why you dwell on this question.  I -- I explained the situation prevailing as far as political parties were concerned in Rwanda.  Therefore, you ought not to insist on such a question if you do not know what situation prevailed at the time.  Otherwise, you will fruitlessly waste time because you have no idea about the situation prevailing at the time.  

I tell you this, in places where the MDR held its meetings -- meetings or rallies, in Gitarama, Butare, Gikongoro and Cyangugu, if at any one of these places supporters of the MDR noticed that one was an MRND member, the MDR activists would take that person out of their office, forcing them to wear the colours of the MDR, forcefully.  And at that time it was noticed that even bourgmestres were subjected to pressure as a result of the force or strength of the more important party in their commune, because each party had varying degrees of influence in different areas.  I was, therefore, not the exception.  I had to take precautions to stay alive. 
Q.	Witness XBM, we have heard testimony about Kubohoza and what was going on in Rwanda.  But my question is, if you told us that you resigned as **********************************because you were forced to join the CDR, why did you tell the Prosecutor on the 26th and 27th of February that you remained ************************through 1994?  
A.	In short, I think I have given you enough explanations on that.  While it is true that in 1992 I stopped the recruitment activities because my safety was under threat; on the other hand, my party was still in my heart.  And I think that is what is recorded in the statement. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, the witness explained this situation in his examination-in-chief, and he has repeated this explanation to you in cross-examination. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  And I have put to him an inconsistency between the explanation that he gave in examination-in-chief and --
JUDGE SHORT:
Well, he explained the inconsistency where he stated, in reality he was the chairman of MDR until 1994, because of threats he stopped campaigning for the party and was forced to join the other party. 

MR. ROBINSON: 
That is correct, that is his explanation. 
JUDGE SHORT:
He gave that explanation in examination-in-chief and he has given that explanation also in cross-examination. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness XBM, did you ever become an official of the CDR party? 
A.	Regarding the CDR, this was a party that worked closely with the MRND party.  As for the post -- the leadership position, it was never given to me.  I was closely monitored by people who at one point sought to give me a leadership position.  And that is why whenever a meeting or political rally was held I was informed about it.  And I had no other way of ensuring my safety.  I would have to participate at every meeting I was invited to. 
Q.	But my question was:  Were you an official at any level of the CDR party or were you simply a member? 
A.	The leadership position has not yet been assigned to me.  However, they had noticed that I was someone who was very zealous as an MDR member.  And they tried to get me to leave that party in order to recruit me because they thought that what I was doing for the MDR, I would do for the CDR.  It was, therefore, a way of bringing me, and thereby brings other members that I had recruited into the CDR.  And they wanted me to stop my sensitisation campaign for the MDR, because I was getting the population to change their views.  And they wanted me to put a stop to all of these activities, to this campaign, that I should no longer denigrate the CDR and the MRND, and that I should change tack and begin to campaign for those two parties.  So it was a way of inculpating their ideals their policies into me, so once I was convinced I would now conduct a campaign on their behalf.  I was closely monitored. 
JUDGE SHORT:
So, Witness, listen carefully to the question and answer it directly and briefly.  You were asked a simple question; were you an ordinary member of the CDR or were you given an official position?  You have given a long explanation which doesn't answer the question.  You will save a lot of time if you would listen carefully to the question and answer it briefly and concisely. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  But I quite agree with you then, I should give brief, precise answers.  However, as you notice, it is difficult for me to answer questions put to me by the Defence counsel in just a few words, because I can see he is trying to dwell on each question; even a very simple question he tries to dwell on all of the time.  And that is why I am trying to give him explanations.  And I would like to call on the Court to tell him that he is wasting its time.  

I actually think you did invite him to do that, telling him that he should not keep wasting the Court's time.  As you say, I will try to be precise and concise, but in Rwanda when you are speaking to someone and you notice that they do not understand you, you try to speak at length in order to give him a lot of explanations, because as you know not everyone can understand -- people do not understand things the same way.  Perhaps, then, Mr. Robinson is one of those who does not catch on quickly. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, if counsel is wasting the time of the Court, the Court will draw his attention to it.  It is not for you to determine whether counsel is wasting the time of the Court.  Now, answer the question.  Were you an ordinary member of the CDR, or were you given an official position?  
THE WITNESS:
I have already answered that question.  I said that I wasn't given any position of responsibility.  Yet he did not seek to understand me, but went on asking more questions.  He wanted to dwell on the fact that I said that I was ************************in 1991 and '92.  And that later on, I left the party to join another party, and that I had lied to the investigators, telling them that I was ******************************until 1994. So I was trying to provide explanations to him in that connection.  Between 1991 and 1992, I -- I have already told him about the prevailing circumstances at that time.  And I also referred to the changes that occurred between 1992 and 1994.  So I believe that the problem does not lie with me, it lies with the Defence counsel, because I did everything possible to explain everything to him. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Can you give me the names of the political parties whose membership cards you held between 1991 and 1994? 
A.	Are you asking me to tell you the number of cards that I owned, or are you trying to find out the membership cards which I distributed?  Are you talking about the political parties or the membership card that I may have had of a given political party?  
Q.	You told us that it was necessary to show different membership cards when encountering different youth groups.  So I'm wondering which parties membership cards did you have personally? 
A.	I held membership cards for the MDR party, as I have already explained.  
Q.	And did you have a membership card of the CDR party? 
A.	Yes, I had a CDR membership card.  And I will answer in order to settle this matter once and for all.  So that the Judges may understand that I am not losing them with too much -- or losing my line of thinking with too much detail.  

This card was issued to me when members of that party compelled me to join the party.  And I accepted to take the card in order to save my own skin.  That is the circumstances -- those are the circumstances, rather, under which I came into possession of that card. 
Q.	Did you ever have a card of the MRND party between 1991 and 1994? 
A.	Between 1991 and '94, I did not own an MRND party member card -- membership card. 
Q.	And what about the PSD party, did you have a membership card for that party between 1991 to 1994? 
A.	I have already painted the picture for you in respect of the procedures that political parties that were authorised in Rwanda used at that time.  I took the example of the PSD and the PL to make my illustration, but I never told you that I had ever become a member of any of those two parties or that I was involved in distributing membership cards for any of those two parties. 
Q.	So is it true then that the only membership cards that you personally had were of the MDR and CDR parties? 
A.	Once again, please, endeavour to understand me clearly, before the advent of multiparty politics, the MRND was the single party and, of course, you will understand that all Rwandans belonged, or were members, belonged of the MRND -- or were members of the MRND.  

Prior to advent of multiparty politics, all Rwandans were compelled to possess MRND membership cards.  There was a registrar of all names of all members.  And all members of the population, of voting age, were given MRND membership cards, and their names entered in the registrar of the secteur and cellule where they lived.  And any such person was expected to sign.  It is, therefore, under those circumstances that that card was issued to me.  So you can see that I was in possession of the MRND card even prior to 1991.  
Q.	Did you have any other political party membership cards in your possession? 
A.	I have just answered that question, Counsel.  Well, I think that even the Judges do understand that I have already answered. 
Q.	Well, let me see if I --  
A.	Well, I have been asked questions over again, and I don't know whether Counsel Robinson is listening to me.  I wonder whether he understands the answers that I am providing.  Well, what does he expect of me?  What other explanation does he want me to provide?  
Q.	Well, I know I'm kind of slow but let me see if I understand your answer.  You have had membership cards from the MRND when it was a unique party, and the MDR and the CDR, and no other political parties, correct? 
A.	Yes, that is the answer I have already given you. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now prior to the 6th of April in 1994, were there night patrols in your area? 
A.	Yes, there were night patrols in my area before 1994 because the country was in a state of war. 
Q.	And approximately when had those night patrols began in your area? 
A.	That was not part of my duties; it was not for me to control those who were conducting those night patrols.  All I can say is that, yes, there were night patrols at that time. 
Q.	Were there night patrols before the RPF attack of 8 February 1993? 
A.	Counsel, which attack are you referring to and where would that attack have taken place, what location?  
Q.	I'm referring to the attack that came from Uganda in which the RPF arrived within about 15 kilometres of Kigali.
A.	In our capacity as ordinary inhabitants we became aware of that attack two days after the attack. 
Q.	And were the night patrols in existence before that attack? 
A.	The night patrols came into place when it was obvious that the country was going to come under attack. 
Q.	And was that before or after the attack of 8 February 1993? 
A.	I believe that we will not come to a point of understanding if you continue to go down that line of questioning.  I have been told to answer your questions and that it is for the Court to determine whether or not I should answer your questions, but now I note that your questions only amount to a waste of time because you are going backwards rather than moving forward.  I have already told you that when the war broke out, night patrols were introduced.  I, therefore, do not understand why you are referring to 1993, whereas I talked of 1990. 
Q.	And can you tell us if you ever participated in night patrols? 
A.	Well, Counsel, I was a Rwandan citizen.  Why should I not have taken part in those night patrol?  
Q.	And did you receive a weapon to use during your night patrols? 
A.	What type of weapon are you talking about?  
Q.	I'm asking you if you received any weapon to use in your night patrol. 
A.	When someone is part of a night patrol -- well, and you put that type of question to me, I wonder whether it is a joke of sorts.  You see when you are on a night patrol you don't go empty handed.  What I am saying is that I had a stick with me. 
Q.	How were people chosen for the night patrols? 
A.	Prior to 1994, that is in 1990, the beginning of the war and up to 1993, that is towards the end of the year 1993, night control patrols was organised according to Nyumbakumi, that is in ten folds, ten households put together from which able-bodied persons would be selected.  And those persons would be informed that it was incumbent on them to lead the night patrols at night.  And that is how the patrols went on with one group relaying the other. 
(Pages 10 to 23 by Donna M. Lewis)















1230H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So the night patrols were organised by the authorities of the government and not by the political parties, correct? 
A.	Political party authorities had no authority to organise night patrols.  The night patrols were organised by officials. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'm about to go into another area.  Would you like to take the recess at this time?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we take our lunch break now. 
(Court recessed from 1230H to 1417H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may continue, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, I was just discussing with Mr. Webster the situation concerning Mr. Serugendo and the report that was received by the registry -- upon the registry, filed on the 26th of June, and I was wondering if the Trial Chamber would have a preference for when it would be a convenient time to raise that matter. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Well, we have had a chance to see it now.  How are you going in terms of your -- with this witness?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I think I'll be finished by the end of the week, as I planned, which is tomorrow, Friday morning.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I've already expressed myself on this particular point before, but I'd like to remind the Trial Chamber that we have two witnesses waiting to testify, and the next witness on our proposed order of testimony is ALG, which is a witness that is expected to take at least two full weeks.  And if we do not start with ALG on Monday, it is unlikely that we will be able to take his testimony and complete it during this session.  So I just want to make the Court aware of that, and that is the next witness that we're proposing to begin with.  

As a practical matter, we're not considering at this point AWB.  All of our attention is focused on ALG.  This is a witness who has travelled to Arusha at least twice before to testify in this trial and was sent back, I think, two times.  I may be corrected, but at least once before being sent back without having testified, so we do have to move forward with his testimony. 

MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I tell that you I am going to be within the time estimates, the rules that we have set forth at the beginning of this session, so I don't think that it was unexpected that if the Prosecution takes a day and a quarter -- or, let's say a day and a half with re-direct with this witness, that there would be four and a half days of cross-examination, so -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, that's not exactly my point.  We are looking now at content.  The cross-examination has been moving very slowly, and I know it's not entirely a question of the questions that are being put but the method by which the witness has been answering.  

Mr. Witness, we have taken a good lot of time because of the way you have been responding to the questions that have been put to you.  My colleague had suggested to you earlier today that you should actually listen clearly to the question that is put and just answer the question.  You have been talking quite a lot and have been a bit argumentative, and that is not really necessary in a trial setting of this sort.  So I think we will go a bit quicker -- much quicker if you could answer the question that you are asked exactly and then talk -- and then stop talking.  

Mr. Robinson, see if you can expedite the process.  If you can move quicker, it would be much better for everybody. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I understand.  And when would you like to discuss the issue of Serugendo?  Because I would like to have his testimony heard, if possible, this session.  Once we leave it's going to be very difficult to organise anything.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I didn't really want to start, but you've read the report. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I've read the report. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there any way around that?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, I would note that the registrar thinks that in one month we should recheck his condition.  I was going to ask that you recheck his condition in one week.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sooner?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, because if there's any chance of taking his testimony in the last week of the session, if his condition -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I can draw this to the registrar's attention.  Because that is why we thought it was necessary to rush the discussion.  But if that is your simple request, I could convey that to the registrar and see what we can do on that respect.  
MR. ROBINSON:
That's the only thing I could think of in light of the report. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, then we've had a discussion, and I'll communicate with the registrar on that basis. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Thank you very much.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, Witness XBM, I am now going to turn to questions about the various meetings which you were allowed to testify to during your direct examination.  And I want to start with the first CDR rally that you attended.  Can you tell us approximately when that took place and where?  
A.	The meeting took place in Ruhengeri.  
Q.	Was it at the Ruhengeri stadium? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And was it in the month of June 1993? 
A.	Yes, it was. 
Q.	And during that meeting were there any military officials who were in attendance? 
A.	Yes, there were soldiers.  You will understand that there were a lot of soldiers present because that region was a combat zone.  
Q.	Were there any prominent soldiers or prominent military personnel such as Colonel Bagosora, Colonel Anatole Nsengiyumva, or Colonel Augustin Bizimungu who were present? 
A.	Bizimungu was present. 
Q.	And did he address the meeting? 
A.	No, he said nothing. 
Q.	Who were the speakers at the meeting? 
A.	Different figures of authority, notably, Barayagwiza and Bucyana. 
Q.	And were there any officials of the MRND party in attendance? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Was Colonel Bizimungu introduced to the gathering? 
A.	People already knew him and they had given him a select place in which to sit at the meeting. 
Q.	Was there discussion of the distribution of weapons at this meeting? 
A.	Yes, there was. 
Q.	And can you tell us what was said and by whom? 
A.	Those two officials said that the youth had to be sensitised and also trained militarily, and that subsequently weapons would be distributed. 
Q.	And who was it that said those things?  
A.	Whether it be Bucyana or Barayagwiza, both of them talked about that subject.  
Q.	Now, in connection with that meeting, was there a person who had been injured before that meeting by the name of Safari? 
A.	No, it wasn't Safari, it was his second chauffeur.  
Q.	And was this person taken to the hospital, as far as you know? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Now, after the rally where did you go? 
A.	We went home. 
Q.	And did you yourself go to the bar of Bigirimana?  That's B-I-G-I-R-I-M-A-N-A. 
A.	Yes, we went to that bar, and we had a drink. 
Q.	Was that before you went home? 
A.	Very well. 
Q.	And can you tell us where that bar is located, in which préfecture, in Ruhengeri or Gisenyi? 
A.	It is Gisenyi préfecture. 
Q.	How from the Bigogwe camp? 
A.	It is less than 500 metres.  Not more than 500 metres, in any event. 
Q.	How did you get to that bar from the rally, on foot or by vehicle? 
A.	I was in a vehicle. 
Q.	Were you with other people? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, did Barayagwiza come to Bigirimana's bar while you were there? 
A.	Yes, we were together when we left Ruhengeri.  
Q.	Did you come in the same vehicle as Barayagwiza? 
A.	No. 
Q.	At Bigirimana's bar, did Barayagwiza say anything about weapons? 
A.	Yes, he said something about weapons. 
Q.	And what did he say? 
A.	He said there was a need to choose from among the youths, people who would receive weapons, firearms, because the weapons available were not enough, and so a list would have to be drawn up of people who were to receive the weapons. 
Q.	And was he telling you this privately or were a number of people hearing this statement by Barayagwiza? 
A.	He was speaking to members of his party. 
Q.	And approximately how many members of his party were there? 
A.	I did not count them. 
Q.	Was it closer to 10 or closer to 100? 
A.	The bar was full.  In fact, some people were standing outside the barroom, and so it's very hard for me to give a figure.  There were lots of people. 
Q.	Okay.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would ask that the registrar supply the witness with a piece of paper, a blank piece of paper.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness XBM, I'm asking that you tell us the names of those people who were at Bigirimana's bar on the day of the rally of the CDR party in Ruhengeri stadium who heard -- or who were present when Mr. Barayagwiza made these statements about the weapons.  And if you could just write those names on the piece of paper, I'd appreciate it.  
A.	Counsel, I think that you already have the list of people.  Remember that Their Honours asked us not to waste any more time.  
Q.	Well, Witness, I'm asking you to give us the names of the people who attended at Bigirimana's bar.  You haven't given this information before this trial, and so what I would like you to do is take that piece of paper and just write the names that you remember.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, if I may.  I hesitate to interrupt Mr. Robinson, especially since time is of the essence, but I notice in his cross-examinations we always come to a point where he's asking witnesses to give extended names of participants of meetings, and this to me seems more an extension of Defence investigation than a valid line of cross-examination.  And at some point I would ask the Court to put an end to it.  It's not appropriate.  

Having a witness on the stand is not an opportunity to conduct defence investigations and this is the type of thing that slows down our cross-examinations in this case with regularity.  So perhaps the Chamber could think about this issue and rule on it, but it -- it certainly slows things down when we get names -- you know, this type of questioning is simply not appropriate for -- to look at issues of the witness's credibility.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would be prepared to respond to that if you feel it's necessary, but I would like to have the witness remove his headphones before I do.  Otherwise, I can just continue.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, was this meeting addressed in-chief?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.
 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Were the parties who are concerned mentioned in evidence?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Pardon?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Were the persons who were present mentioned in evidence?  
MR. ROBINSON:
No. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will permit the question. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness XBM, please -- yes.  Witness XBM, the Trial Chamber has permitted my question, and so I'm asking you to write down the names of the people who you can recall were present at Bigirimana's bar after the CDR rally in Ruhengeri stadium.  
A.	Counsel, I think that, had you asked me to provide this information, it would be useful for you and for others.  I am certain you have the list, because we have been talking about this for a long time.  As far as I am concerned, I will agree with the Prosecutor.  I do not understand why you are trying to obtain the list.  If you want to contradict me, I think I will not give you the list.  No, I will not.  I intend, rather, to give the Chamber the list because if you are representing your client, it is because you are trying to exculpate him at any rate.  So you are not ready to deal with me, and if I were to give you the list, it would be of no use to you.  
Q.	Well, Witness XBM, I suggest when you go back to Rwanda you enroll in law school and -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, Mr. Robinson, just let me --

Mr. Witness, what I wanted to mention to you was that in the court process, different people have different functions, and it was the function of the Judge -- Judges to determine whether the question was one which could be answered.  The information which you give to this Court will be put in writing; it will be under seal -- it will not be subject to be published, but it will be used by the Court, by the Judges, in evaluating the witness in the trial.  

Now, we made a ruling that the question was permissible, and so you are required to answer the question.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I have no fear -- I do not have any fear giving you the list.  Mr. President, you criticised me for dwelling too much on the details because I was trying to give you ample information.  As you can see, I'm not sure if this is a Rwandan idiosyncrasy, but when you address someone and that person does not want to understand you, you do everything to ensure that they understand, you shout out.  That is what I was doing, giving him explanations, going into the details so that he could understand.  

Regarding the list of those who were present, well, I have no problem giving him the list.  But not to Robinson.  Even if the Chamber orders that I give him the list, I do not want to do it.  I am prepared, rather, to give the Chamber the list.  He should not address me if he has to conduct investigations.  I am in an intelligent person and I do not want to help him.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, Mr. Witness, my comment was not intended to be a criticism, but the way the court system operates, you get through much more effectively and efficiently if you just answered the question which was asked of you.  So it was really advising you on a method of managing the environment in the courtroom.  And I do think it would be better if you took my advice and concentrated on concise answers to the precise question that was put.  

With regard to the provision of the list, the list will be provided to the Court.  It will be filed under seal, which means that the parties to the trial will have access to it, but not the public.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understand you, Mr. President, and I have never refused to give the list.  I can confirm to the Court, but not to the Defence lawyer.  I think I have not been in contempt of Court at all.  I am very well aware that he has the list.  He just wants to waste the Court's time.  

Mr. President, I am prepared to give you the list, which I will hand over to the Chamber.  In that way we will conclude.  If you ask me to, I will go on.  I can give more than 50 names.  Some are still alive.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, let me explain something to you.  We are not going to order you to give the list in these circumstances, you see.  But I'll explain to you that when we are evaluating your testimony, the way you behave in the courtroom, your demeanour in the courtroom, the way you have responded to questions, the type of questions you refuse to answer to and the reasons you have given for it, will be one of the factors that we will take into account in deciding how much reliance we can put on your evidence.  Now, I think I've explained enough to you for you to exercise your own common sense in this circumstance and to respond accordingly.  

Mr. Robinson, you may proceed.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness XBM, just let me know when you've finished writing and I'll ask you my next question.  
A.	But I would like to make a small comment.  You know, I am not a lawyer.  I know nothing about international law.  As regards my demeanour in court, I felt it was enough to come and testify in court, to narrate all the events I was an eyewitness to, but I have noticed there is a problem.  Can you imagine how one would behave as one explains to someone who does not want to understand?  So, I do not want to behave that way before the Court so as to prove to the Court that what I am saying is true.  I think that what is important is to tell you the truth about all that happened.  

Regarding the issue raised by the counsel, I think it is the Chamber that is above everyone here, be it the Prosecutor or Defence counsel or myself.  I think that the Defence counsel is here to defend his clients and that is why he is attempting to raise never-ending problems because he would like to extend the proceedings for as long as possible.  It would be to his advantage.  Therefore, I'd like to tell you that I'm not here to bend to the demands of the Defence counsel.  As regards the list, I have the list and I am prepared to give it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, Mr. Witness, the comment I would like to make to you is this:  When you are giving your testimony, the testimony is given to the Court.  It is elicited by the answers you give to the questions put to you by the counsel designated for that purpose.  It is completely unnecessary for you to argue or to have a discussion with the lawyers who are questioning you.  That's not necessary at all.  What we are looking at as the Judges are the answers that you have given to the questions and we will assess those answers as a means of assisting us as to what actually transpired.  Do you understand me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I see that the problem here is the list of the names of those people.  I am ready to give you the list, but I will give it to the Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, then do that and we can move on.  

Mr. Witness, I'm just -- just for clarity, we are not promising you -- we are not giving you an undertaking that the Defence lawyer is not going to see that list.  The list is given to the Court; it's put in evidence under seal, as I've explained to you.  But the parties to the proceedings will have access to it.  Do you understand me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I quite agree that the Defence lawyer should consult the list.  Mr. President, you know, one must be careful. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I just didn't want you to get the impression that we are giving you any undertaking that we were not doing.  So it's just for clarity I mention that.  But you may proceed now, if you wish.  
THE WITNESS:
There were many people taking part in the meeting but I have just drafted a list of 20 people.  I think that will suffice. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness XBM.  And I would like you to circle on that list the names of those persons with whom you yourself travelled in the same car, either from Ruhengeri stadium to the bar or from the bar back to your commune.  So put a circle around those names that you personally travelled with.  
A.	I do not want to do that. 
Q.	Well, then let me ask you, then, can you tell me who it was that you travelled with from the Ruhengeri stadium to Bigirimana's bar? 
A.	I told you that I was in the company of all those people, and I have drafted a list.  I don't know what else you are looking for. 
Q.	Can you tell me what kind of vehicle you travelled in when you went from the bar -- from the rally to the bar?  
A.	It was a Daihatsu vehicle belonging to a gentleman by the name of Safari. 
Q.	And can you tell us approximately how many people were in that vehicle? 
A.	The vehicle was full.  You can imagine what the capacity of such a Daihatsu-make vehicle would be.  What is more, it was not the only vehicle.  There were other vehicles transporting members of the party. 
Q.	And how did you get home from the bar? 
A.	I went home on foot. 
Q.	Did you go with anyone? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What was the name of the person that you went with, or the people that you went with? 
A.	Listen, I think I heard that it is not a good idea to give the names of people in public.  So I would like to ask the President and honourable Judges whether it is an acceptable thing to do.  I don't know whether you want to confuse me or whether you want to make me feel insecure, but I know that in 2003, when I came to testify before this Trial Chamber, I gave all the names, and I do not know why I have to repeat all those names.  Does Defence counsel want my life to be in danger once I return to Rwanda?  If he needs information on the subject of those people, and were he to obtain information on the subject of those people, it would not be a good idea because those people would hold it against me.  
Q.	Witness, you can circle on that piece of paper the names of the people with whom you walked home from Bigirimana's bar so it will not be necessary for you to mention those names in public.  Just put a circle around the names that you've written already on the paper.  
A.	Yes, I'm ready to do so.  But I did outline the problem that I'm up against to the Chamber.  I shall do what you ask because the Judges have asked me to do so, and not because you, Counsel, have asked me to do so. 
Q.	That's understood.  So, have you placed a circle around the names of the people who you travelled with from the bar to your commune?  
A.	Yes, I have just done so. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And Mr. President, I would ask that this document be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ161, under seal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ161 admitted, under seal) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And can you tell us approximately what time the meeting ended -- what time Mr. Barayagwiza left Bigirimana's bar approximately, that day?  
A.	At approximately 5 p.m.  Night was falling, and it was approximately 5 p.m.  
Q.	Witness XBM, I put it to you that after the rally in Ruhengeri stadium, Mr. Barayagwiza went to the hospital where the person who had been injured during that rally was being treated, and that he never was at Bigirimana's bar on that day.  Would you like to comment on that?  
A.	If somebody else gave you that piece of information, well, as far as I'm concerned, personally, I never gave you that piece of information.  If you have a written document claim that Barayagwiza was at the hospital, then you should show that document to me. 
Q.	Well, what I'm actually referring to is testimony given under oath in the trial of Bagosora and Nsengiyumva, at which you testified.  The testimony was given by a witness with a pseudonym YD1 on the 12th of December 2005, at pages 51 and 52 of the transcript, and this person testified that after the meeting, Mr. Barayagwiza came to the hospital to see about the person -- to see the person who had been injured at that rally, and he stayed at the hospital until 11 p.m.  So now knowing that, would you like to comment on that?  
MR. LAHAIE:
With your leave, Mr. President, I'm -- I am not convinced that YD1 was in fact that person.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'm not -- I don't completely understand that, but I haven't given the identity of YD1 because the Trial Chamber I, in their order in which these transcripts were disclosed, specifically indicated I was not to do that.  So I'm not representing that YD1 is any specific person, but I'm summarising the information that he provided to the Trial Chamber.  So I'm not sure what Mr. Lahaie's expectations are as to the identity of YD1, but I've made no representations about that at all.  
MR. LAHAIE:
My objection was not on that subject, Mr. President.  In the French translation of what was said, I was led to believe that YDI, who witnessed in Bagosora -- testified in Bagosora, et al, was a witness.  I don't know whether in this case -- I don't know whether the translation was incorrect or not.  But if, as my learned friend said, YDI is in fact XBM, then that is not the information I have received through the translation.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I think there's some confusion.  Maybe I'll just start over because there's no relationship between Witness YDI and XBM. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Lahaie, as far as I understand the situation, the counsel was putting to the witness the source of the information that he was using in cross-examination.  And this source was the testimony given by that witness in the Bagosora trial, and he indicated the date and page of the transcript, which would permit reference.  
MR. LAHAIE:
Yes, what I understood from the translation was that Witness YDI in Bagosora was, in fact, XBM in this case, and so that information on the witness is inexact.  Well, if that is what was interpreted, then it is incorrect.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
If there's a problem with the translation, I think it will be addressed in a routine manner at the end of the day.  

Mr. Robinson, you can proceed.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  I'm going to ask my question again just to make sure that the witness understood it.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And so Witness XBM, what I'm saying to you is that there was a person who came to testify in Colonel Bagosora's case after you did, and he came on the 12th of December 2005, and his testimony is recorded on this point on the pages 51 and 52 of the transcript.  And what he told the Trial Chamber was that after the meeting in Ruhengeri of the CDR, that Barayagwiza went to the hospital to see the person who had been injured, and that he stayed at that hospital until 11 p.m. and therefore could not have been to Bigirimana's bar, as you have testified.  And so I'm asking you if you would like to make a comment on that evidence.  
A.	Before responding to that, I would like to ask Mr. President if I can -- or whether I'm authorised to provide an explanation that might last for some two minutes.  This would allow me to give details, for my answer to be a clear one.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are permitted to answer.  
THE WITNESS:
With reference to that witness whose pseudonym you have just given and with reference to the statements given by that witness, according to which Barayagwiza did not go back to Bigogwe and that he never reached Bigirimana's bar, I am of the opinion that that witness is not well informed or is, indeed, under-informed and that he gave an incomplete piece of information deliberately.  In view of the fact that, to my knowledge, we did not have time to provide treatment to the person who had been wounded.  

When that person was evacuated to the hospital, that person died immediately.  And Ngeze was present at the time.  Barayagwiza was also present, as were other members.  I was also present.  Maybe you would like to know what happened exactly, or what happened to that person.  

As I have said before, that person was one of the drivers.  He was an assistant driver -- correction -- of a person by the name of Safari, who was the proprietor of a vehicle.  The vehicle -- we were taken in the vehicle from his residence and driven to Ruhengeri.  Once we reached Ruhengeri, a number of people stayed at the stadium, whereas another group continued travelling in that same vehicle and went to Mukungwa river.  The group was to go and meet other Impuzamugambi who were coming from Kigali.  
(Pages 24 to 35 by Karen Holm)





















1515H
THE WITNESS:  (continued)
On their return, they came back in vehicles from Ruhengeri and also from Kigali.  They were beating drums and they were chanting slogans when the vehicles arrived at the stadium.  And then they took part in a march in front of the stadium.  

The youth that was aboard that vehicle -- on board that vehicle, well, some of them hung onto the edge of the vehicle with small piece of rope.  And it is at that moment in time that the rope connecting the assistant driver to the vehicle broke, and that person fell down on the ground and was trodden on by people who were walking, and also driven over by the vehicle.  

We then immediately took that person to hospital; the meeting had not yet commenced at that moment.  And on arriving at the hospital, we found a Tutsi lady on location.  She was a medical assistant and she was in the company of a white doctor.  But the white doctor arrived at a slightly later stage, because the medical assistant had to go and fetch that doctor.  When the doctor arrived, he took the wounded person into his consultation rooms, but after a few moments that wounded person died.  And, as a result, Ngeze and Barayagwiza then beat the medical assistant of Tutsi ethnic origin.  

So, those are the circumstances of the death of that person, and that's how things happened.  To say that Barayagwiza was at the hospital until 11 p.m., well, that is just not true.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Were there any Tutsis beaten at Bigirimana's bar that evening, or that day?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Could Counsel Robinson please repeat his question?  
THE WITNESS: 
(No interpretation) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, the request -- we've had a request for you to repeat it.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Were there any Tutsis beaten at Bigirimana's bar that day? 
A.	Yes, there were, some Tutsis were beaten.  And I remember that we found some Tutsis having a drink of beer at that bar.  
Q.	And were they beaten while Barayagwiza was there? 
A.	Yes, he was there.  
Q.	I'm going to read to you some of your testimony that you gave during the trial of Colonel Bagosora and Mr. -- Colonel Nsengiyumva.  And this begins on page 13 of the testimony you gave on the **************2003.  You were asked by the Prosecutor:  "What did you do after the meeting ended?"  
And you answered:  "We went back, and Barayagwiza offered us drinks near the Bigogwe camp, in a bar of a certain Bigirimana.  He brought us drinks."  

And you were asked:  "How many of you went to the bar with Barayagwiza?"  And you said, "About 70."  

And you were asked:  "And did anything happen when you got to the bar?"  And your answer was:  "Yes, when we got to the bar we found Tutsis there, and Barayagwiza asked strong young people who were there to seek out the Tutsis, and that is what they did."  

And then you were asked:  "What happened after they were sought out?"  And you said:  "We drank to our satisfaction, and Barayagwiza asked our secteur representatives to select strong young people so that he could request weapons for them."  

And then you were asked:  "When the Tutsis were sought out, did anything happen to them?"  And you answered:  "Yes, people were listed by secteurs, people who could receive the weapons, the weapons he had promised in the Ruhengeri meeting."  

And then the question -- the Prosecutor said:  "My question, Witness, was:  When the Tutsi had been sought out while you were at the bar, did anything happen to those Tutsi if they were found -- if any were found?"  And your answer was:  "No, on that day nothing was done to them."  

So, can you explain to us why you testified here that the Tutsis were beaten in Bigirimana's bar, and why you testified in Colonel Bagosora's trial that nothing was done to the Tutsi in Bigirimana's bar? 
A.	It depends on how you want to process the information that I gave you.  As far as the beating is concerned, I know that those Tutsi were beaten.  What is more, I wonder why you are coming back, or revisiting that trial.  I know that we went far into great detail during that trial.  It is true that Tutsis were beaten, but nobody died as a result.  As far as my testimony's concerned, well, I know that I testified in the Bagosora case, Anatole as well.  It could be that the Prosecutor in that case -- or -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Correction from Kinyarwanda booth. 
THE WITNESS: 
-- that the Defence counsel in that case has asked you specifically to ask me those questions.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Well, Witness, the premise is that if someone is telling the truth, they will remember the event in the same way.  And you are remembering the event in totally opposite ways, which leads me to suggest to you that you're not telling the truth about the events at Bigirimana's bar.  
A.	I think I will ask you the following question:  What I testified to in 2003 in the Trial Chamber, I remember it clearly.  And the questions that you are asking me today, I am answering them because I remember all the facts.  

You have just asked me the question as to what happened to the Tutsis, and I told you that the Tutsis were beaten, but that nobody had died.  The most important thing is that nobody died.  I said that nothing happened to the Tutsis, and in so doing, I meant that they were not killed.  I don't see where the contradiction lies in your eyes.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I'm about to go on to the next meeting, so would you like to take our mid-afternoon recess at this time?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I would like to raise a point, though, because we have to be clear on what we're driving at when we point to previous testimony as a prior inconsistent fact.  Because I have in front of me a statement from this witness.  It's the same statement that Mr. Robinson mentioned in the earlier portion of his cross-examination.  And clearly in this statement -- in the English version at least -- at the page ending on -- the K-number ending in 952, the witness talks about the same incident, and mentions that Tutsis were beaten in the presence of Barayagwiza.  And this is something that Mr. Robinson is well aware of.  So I think it puts the witness and this Court at a disadvantage when one portion of the witness' testimony is brought to his attention, when it's clear that this witness has made prior consistent statements.  

And if Mr. Robinson wants to be true -- wants to be fair to the witness, and to the fact-finding process, these are things that should be put to the witness at the same time.  It should not wait for a re-examination to come back to a point where the Prosecutor's placed in the position of having to bring to the Court's attention prior consistent statements.  It wastes the Court's time, it's not productive, it's not something that we would want to explore in re-examination, and if we're going to be fair to the fact-finding process, this is something that should be put to the witness. 

Now, look at this statement.  Mr. Robinson has it; I'm sure he's aware of this passage.  So to point to one point in the Barayagwiza testimony is an unfair way of addressing the point of this particular witness.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I want to be fair to the witness, and so if you would like me to, whenever I confront the witness with an inconsistent statement, I can be happy to also confront him with other statements which he's made on the same subject in the past, some of which may be consistent, some of which may also be inconsistent.  I'm certainly willing to do that, especially when it's being inferred that I'm not being fair if I don't do that.  So if you would like me to do that -- it will lengthen my cross-examination, but I am happy to do that.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, we can't -- I can't answer your question in that way.  We are interested in fairness; we are also interested in expedition.  And there's a level at which we have to rely on the discretion of the professionals who are appearing before us.  

We take the tea -- mid-afternoon recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1535H to 1613H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You may proceed, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness XBM, I want to ask you now about a meeting that you described that took place on Mount Muhe.  Can you tell us, first of all, in what préfecture is Mount Muhe?  
A.	Mount Muhe is in Gisenyi préfecture. 
Q.	And what direction from Gisenyi town is it located?  
A.	When you reach Bigogwe, you then go towards Gishwati forest, and that is when mount -- where Mount Muhe is located.  
Q.	Is it south of Gisenyi town?  
A.	It is to the north of the town Gisenyi, because if you go southwards, you go towards Lake Kivu. 
Q.	And how far is Mount Muhe from your residence, approximately? 
A.	It is a distance that can be covered in two to two-and-a-half hours.  
Q.	On foot, or by vehicle? 
A.	On foot -- in (unintelligible), because there aren't many vehicles in our area.  You know, people move around on foot, on the whole.  
Q.	And can you tell us how you first heard about the event which was to take place on Mount Muhe in September 1993? 
A.	That information was given to me by the members of the party as information was circulated amongst members as to what was going on. 
Q.	And that's the CDR party, correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And what were you told was the occasion for this meeting on Mount Muhe? 
A.	There weren't any incidents at Mount Muhe.  And what is more, I do not think that I said that there had been an incident.  If I understand correctly, when we were talking about incidents, in general one would be talking about an accident or something bad happening.  As far as I am aware, nothing happened -- nothing untoward happened at Mount Muhe.  
Q.	Was there some connection between the meeting at Mount Muhe and the RTLM radio station?  
A.	No.  What happened at Mount Muhe -- well, it wasn't a political meeting.  It was just that we had gone to start constructing the RTLM radio antenna. 
Q.	And was this some kind of ceremony in connection with that RTLM antenna? 
A.	Yes, there was a ceremony, but it didn't last for very long. 
Q.	When you got to Mount Muhe, was the RTLM antenna there? 
A.	No, we had gone to begin construction, in the sense that we were launching the project.  We hadn't gone to actually unveil the antenna as such; we had begun to begin construction -- we had gone to begin construction. 
Q.	And were the materials to build the antenna present when you arrived in Mount Muhe? 
A.	What materials are you referring to, Counsel?  
Q.	I'm referring to the steel, for example, in which -- from which an antenna is constructed.  
A.	Yes, that type of material was already on location.  But then we went to level out the area and lay the foundations.  We needed to prepare the terrain, and that was the location where we were due to set up, or construct the antenna.  The materials -- well, other people were dealing with such matters.  All I know is that the construction project was actually put in place.  
Q.	And did you have something to do with this construction project?  Were you working on it? 
A.	No, I was not involved, but I know that the members of the population needed that antenna because they were not able to receive Radio RTLM that was broadcasting from Kigali.  So, the members of that region talked to the leaders of the CDR with a view to asking for this antenna to be constructed in that location so that they would be able to receive the radio broadcasts.  
Q.	And approximately how many people attended this ceremony on Mount Muhe that day? 
A.	There were between 400 and 600 people.  That is an approximation.  
Q.	Can you tell us the names of the authorities who were present? 
A.	There were normal state employees present.  I would say that amongst the authorities, there was Mr. Barayagwiza and Anatole.  
Q.	Was the préfet of Gisenyi present?  
A.	No, I did not see him there. 
Q.	Was Ferdinand Nahimana present? 
A.	I told you that there were authorities of varying kinds, but I was not able to lay eyes on figures of authority that I had known before.  I have told you that Anatole Nsengiyumva was present, as was Barayagwiza.  But that does not mean that other authorities were not present as well.  
Q.	Were there any authorities or personalities from RTLM radio in attendance?  
A.	Yes, as I've already told you, I said that there were authorities of different types present.  Anatole was an authority, as was Barayagwiza.  And I was not in charge of protocol, and, as a result, I cannot give you the names of all the figures of authority who were present. 
Q.	Were there any representatives of the MRND party, that you know of, that were present?  
A.	Are you talking about the leaders of the MRND, and if so, from what area, Counsel?  
Q.	I'm asking you if there were any leaders of MRND present, whether from the national authorities or from Gisenyi préfecture. 
A.	If you want me to talk about the figures of authority of the MRND at the national level, and also those from Kigali, well, I was not able to verify at a préfectoral level, but I was able to note the presence of the leader of the MRND at the level of commune, and his name was Ntameherezo. 
Q.	Could you please spell that for the court reporters?  
A.	N-T-A-M-A-H-E-R-E-Z-O. 
Q.	Thank you.  Were there any other military officers present besides Anatole Nsengiyumva? 
A.	There was Anatole Nsengiyumva, and he was the ops commander of Gisenyi préfecture. 
Q.	And were there any other military authorities that you recognised besides Anatole Nsengiyumva? 
A.	Anatole was the highest ranking officer in that area, and as a result no one else was supposed to take the floor in the name of the army in his presence.  
Q.	Did you know a Lieutenant Bizumuremyi?  That's B-I-Z-U-M-U-R-E-M-Y-I.  
A.	No, I do not know Lieutenant Bizumuremyi.  However, I do know Major Bizumuremyi.  
Q.	And was he an officer in the Rwandan army, stationed in Gisenyi? 
A.	I just knew he was a soldier.  I had seen him in Gisenyi.  Yes, he was a soldier, but did not seek to understand things.  Do not mix things up.  I know that you definitely have Bizumuremyi's name on the list, or the document you have.  If you have anything to say about that I would like you to produce a document for the Chamber.  If you have nothing to say on that, then let's not dwell on it.  
Q.	Was this Bizumuremyi present at the ceremony at Mount Muhe? 
A.	But, I told you, do not try and distract us.  And I gress (sic) -- I am not sure, are you trying to test me?  
Q.	I think you can just answer the question very simply by telling us whether or not, to your recollection, he was there or he wasn't.  
A.	Once again, I notice that you are trying to dwell on pointless topics.  I have already told you that if you happen to have that person's name on the document before you, then produce it, please.  I personally did not see him there.  If I am mistaken and that person was actually present, then produce the document so that everyone is enlightened.  
Q.	As far as I know this person was not present in 1993 in Gisenyi at Mount Muhe.  So, we are in agreement with that.  I just wanted you to tell us whether you had seen him or not.  So you didn't see him?  Okay.  It's no problem.  

Now, what about Major Bizimana, the head of the gendarme for Gisenyi, did you see him at Mount Muhe?  
A.	Counsel, there were more than 600 people.  It would therefore be hard for me to distinguish between people.  I could not know the names of all those present, or recognise the faces of everyone so as to know -- identify people.  If I gave you names of people, or did not, it does not mean that these people were not present.  It might just mean that those who reported on it did not see them.  I was there simply to see if the antenna was to be mounted in that place if the project was to be launched.  These, therefore, are the reasons that had brought me to that place.  

Now, as for memorising the names of all those present, I think it would be unfair to expect that of me.  
Q.	Well, Witness XBM, you just could have answered that question by saying, no, you didn't see him there.  It would have been the same, but a lot shorter.  

Now, can you tell us who was the first speaker at this ceremony? 
A.	You are asking me about the order of appearance of the speakers.  I think what is essential is knowing what was said in each speech.  I think the first person who took the floor was Barayagwiza. 
Q.	And tell us what he said.  
A.	In his speech he mostly spoke about the imminent installation of the antenna in that location, and that thanks to the antenna, the public -- the Mutura, Karagwa (phonetic) and Ruhehe communes, up to Gisenyi and Kanama and Rubavu, that people in these areas would now be in a position to receive broadcasts of RTLM radio with ease; that the public would be informed about the situation prevailing in the country -- throughout the country.  
Q.	And is it your testimony that he gave this speech before the antenna was installed, while there was simply dirt on the site? 
A.	At any rate, the place had been laid out, had been levelled, before the first -- the foundation stone was laid for the project.  
Q.	I want to direct your attention to the testimony you gave in the Bagosora trial about this meeting.  On page 31 you were asked, on line 7:  "And where was this meeting?"  And your answer was:  "It wasn't a meeting as such; as such it was a ceremony which took place at Mount Muhe.  The RTLM antenna, which had been installed there, was being inaugurated."  

And then on line 22, you were asked:  "What did Barayagwiza say?"  And your answer was:  "Barayagwiza said that an antenna had just been installed at Mount Muhe for the inhabitants of the northern part of the country."  

Can you explain to the Trial Chamber why, today, you claim that the antenna was not yet installed, and when you testified in 2003, you said that the antenna had already been installed?  
A.	In any event, it is obvious that you are a specialist in telling lies, or in scribing (sic) statements to other persons.  Regarding the fact that it was not a rally, I have already explained in Court, and everybody has heard my explanation.  But, as for you, you do not want to understand.  

Regarding the start of construction, I believe it is because of this that it is said that some things are lost in translation.  It is clearly mentioned in that document because, having given my statement, I was given the document, and I had the chance to go over, so as to verify the content of the document.  It is therefore clearly indicated that this was a foundation-laying ceremony, and not the inauguration of the location, as you say.  

It therefore surprises me to hear that instead of reading what is written in the document, you are putting in your own emotions so as to derail the Judges.  
Q.	Well, Witness XBM, what I just read to you is exactly what you said when you testified at Bagosora's case, and we will be putting in evidence the actual text for the Judges to read for themselves.  So, you need not fear that I'm misleading anyone.  And I suggest to you it's you who have been telling different stories about this event, because the event never took place, except in your imagination.  
A.	In my opinion, I think you are laying emphasis on this question that is inappropriate.  I clearly remember that it was Anatole's counsel, a Kenyan lawyer, who asked me this question.  He was just as deaf as you are.  I did all I could to furnish him explanations, but he did his best to sidestep it.  I explained the events to him, and when I sought to go into detail about those events, he opted to ask me questions about what happened at Busasamana, where I was not present.  So, I think you are specialists in making people lose sight of what is being discussed.  

I am telling you, we were dealing with the ceremony for laying of a foundation stone, a very brief ceremony.  If it had been the inauguration, that would mean there would also have been the laying of the foundation stone.  But I tell you that the foundation stone was laid in 1993.  This was a project that was about to begin, and which would end quickly so that people could -- could have the project they had been demanding for such a long time.  

Counsel, if you wish to understand, I think you will understand.  But if you do not want to understand, then that's your business.  But I know that others here do understand.  
Q.	Witness XBM, how long after the ceremony was it before the antenna was constructed and you could hear RTLM in Gisenyi préfecture?  
A.	Well, now you are beginning to understand, which is to say that you were ascribing certain remarks to me that I did not deliberately make.  If you now begin to understand that this was the laying of the foundation stone, that that was the ceremony taking place. 
Q.	So, how long after the ceremony was it that the antenna was constructed and you could hear radio RTLM in Gisenyi préfecture?  
A.	I did not return to the site so as to closely follow the work. 
Q.	Do you recall when it was that RTLM could be heard in Gisenyi? 
A.	I was about to answer that question, but since it is not recorded anywhere, I believe it would be a waste of time to answer the question.  Since you are denying what is written in the document, whereas I personally know the truth, I wonder if you will accept additional explanation that I might want to provide, which is not contained in the document.  

I signed the statement you have before you.  I am aware that you are entitled to take time to continue cross-examining me.  Ask me about the statements I made that you have before you, because I see that you are putting me in a difficult position. 
Q.	My question is:  You've told us the meeting, or the ceremony, on Mount Muhe took place in September 1993.  When was it that you could hear RTLM in Gisenyi? 
A.	I have just given you the answer to that question.  Be reasonable and think of the statements you are refuting, whereas they are recorded in writing.  Do not trouble to ask me that question.  Do not waste time so that we may make progress.  
Q.	Well, I'm sorry, Witness XBM, but I don't see that information contained in any of the statements that you've given before, so I have to ask you to tell us in Court here:  When did RTLM broadcasts begin being heard in Gisenyi? 
A.	Anyway, I had just said that I do not want to answer the question.  So try to make progress, to move on to the next question. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I would ask you to direct the witness to answer the question.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, there's nothing improper in the question that is put to you.  As long as you can answer, then you should answer it.  
THE WITNESS: 
I think I will answer, but it is clear that as a reasonable person, I will tell you that in December, or in January, we began to hear RTLM broadcasts which could now be received in that region.  I am speaking about my radio set.  So, with my radio set, I now began to listen to the broadcasts.  That does not mean that I went to the site to check if the construction of the antenna had ended.  

I hope, Mr. President, that you have understood me.  So, I am giving this answer so that the Defence counsel, Mr. Robinson, does not continue to use these dilatory measures. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
If the witness could be shown document 10 in my packet of exhibits, please.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness XBM, what has been placed in front of you is a report of an officer from UNAMIR, from the Belgian battalion, named Marc Nees -- N-E-E-S -- and this report is dated the 24th of January 1994.  And in this report, on the very first paragraph, it says in French that the Radio RTLM will install a transmitter on Mount Muhe.  And so the transmitter, or antenna, had not yet been installed as of the 24th of January 1994.  
And I suggest to you further that the person who was responsible for the installation of this antenna, the chief technical officer of RTLM, Joseph Serugendo -- that's S-E-R-U-G-E-N-D-O -- has told the Prosecutor in an interview -- and this is in answer to question number 45 -- that the installation of the antenna on Mount Muhe did not take place until February 1994 because they hadn't received the materials.  And so I suggest to you that, when you claim that in September there was the foundation stone and the material for the antenna present, and that in December or January you could hear RTLM broadcast in Gisenyi, that you're not telling the truth.  Would you like to comment on that?  
A.	Yes, you have just spoken in English, I heard the interpretation in Kinyarwanda.  At any rate, I also understand French.  I would like to take some minutes to read the document. 
(Pages 36 to 45 by Kirstin McLean)




























1700H 
MR. ROBINSON: 
While he is doing that, Mr. President, I would offer the report of UNAMIR as D. NZ162. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ162 admitted)
THE WITNESS:
I think that I have now read through the document.  Even if I find that there are some fact to which I was not an eyewitness, but I think that in view of the fact that this is an exhibit that you want to enter into evidence, I do not see on what basis it can be entered, because the person who drafted this report was not an eyewitness to these events.  It was not somebody who was in search of the truth.  He says himself that other people gave him this information, and he talks especially of the RTLM radio setup in Kigali and the events of Kigali.

In paragraph four, notably, he said that somebody whom Kanyarengwe knew well - Kanyarengwe, who notably was the chairman of the RPF, confirmed that the RPF was not ready to leave Kigali immediately.  As far as Gishwati and Muhe, Gitega and the Tutsis who slept outside of their houses, well those events had turned in -- occurred in the town of Kigali and not in the town of Gisenyi.  So if you rely on this person's report, I think you will never encounter the truth.  Your investigations are in vain.
BY MR. ROBINSON
Q.	Okay, thank you very much for that comment.  Now, I want to ask you about what happened after the meeting on Mount Muhe.  So can you tell us where you went after the meeting? 
A.	I would first of all like to hand this document back to you.  I do not want to have it before me. 
Q.	Okay.  So tell us where you went after the meeting was over at Mount Muhe? 
A.	I think that in order to understand each other you have to accept what I am telling you.  I think you are relying on documents that are producing unfounded information.  So it would be better for you, as an educated gentleman -- and I am sure that I actually followed those events and I was eyewitness to those events.  So, you should not ask me for an explanation on the contents of such a document.  You should not tell me what I should say or lead me.  But if you really want to know what happened, well then let me tell you what happened.  I am recounting facts.  And I don't know what -- or where you were during that period.  And what is more, I would like to congratulate you because you are holding strong in the face of a witness, who is was an eyewitness to events, whereas you were not there; so I congratulate you.  I do not know whether we will have a common ground on which to work, because you are only relying on facts that were recounted by that white gentleman working for UNAMIR.  

What is more, you should understand that the message contained in the French document is not necessarily that contained in the document in the English language.  Had you obtained sufficient information on the matter you would not have put such a document before me. 
Q.	Well, Witness XBM, if it would put you at ease -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Actually, before we go on to the next question, can I make a request for clarification from Mr. Robinson.  At one point Mr. Robinson made a reference to Joseph Serugendo and his statement at response 45, I believe.  And if I could ask him to please restate the point he was making in relation to Serugendo because it is not clear to me, and I am looking through the document.  And I would just like to have that clarified, please.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, according to my notes that I have here, and I don't have that text exactly in hand, but my notes indicate that at question 45 Mr. Serugendo indicated that the installation of Mount Muhe was postponed until February 1994.  

Now, getting back to -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
That is the point I wanted to revisit, because Mr. Serugendo's response at number 45 refers back to his response to question 40, and when I look at question 40 there is a clear statement from Mr. Serugendo, and I will read it:  "During one weekend in December 1993, or January 1994, I personally participated in the temporary installation of the equipment.  The measurements of the site layout had been done so as to enable RTLM to put up its own infrastructure" and in parenthesis it says, "buildings, pylons on, et cetera, as soon as possible."  And this is from a portion of his statement where he is talking about events in Gisenyi at Mount Muhe.  

So, it is not completely clear to me how the reference in his response at 45 provides information that should contradict this witness's testimony.  So, perhaps, Mr. Robinson can explain that.  But when we look at the entire passage in Mr. Serugendo's statement concerning RTLM, there is a clear statement that he himself participated in some sort of event in relation to RTLM in December of 1993. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, if you will give me a minute I will look through this document and I can respond to Mr. Webster, if you think it is necessary; or if you want me to, I can look it up and respond tomorrow. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is better to do it tomorrow, I think.  I'm still concerned about the overall duration of the examination of this witness.  How far we are in terms of percentages, do you think?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I think we are about 50 percent. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Just 50 percent?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Maybe a little more, but I --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.
MR. ROBINSON:
Think I will finish --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Tomorrow? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, I think I will finish before the end of the day on Friday. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Okay, we were still hoping for greater expedition than that at this stage.  But we will see how it goes. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I will do my best.  I don't think my colleagues are going to have a lot of questions, so that may also assist you in getting to know that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just for the record, we had been hoping to complete this witness on Friday, if that's possible.  That is the --  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yeah, I don't --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is aim we would like you to try to work towards. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Definitely I will try, I can't promise.  But if I can also take this occasion to remind you that these kinds of decisions about time are global in nature and could be addressed when the Prosecution is being allowed to go into these matters in the direct examination, and these two meetings we've covered were not in the pre-trial brief and not something we expected to even cross-examine on.  So, the fact that I am taking a long time to cross-examine is in some respects due to the rulings that the Trial Chamber made during the Prosecution's direct examination.  So, I can't help but point that out. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness XBM, what I was going to say to you was that the information I relayed to you from the UNAMIR officer and from the chief technical officer of RTLM, they are both Prosecution witnesses in this case, and so I got this information from the Prosecutor.  So when you tell us that that information is unreliable, you are basically telling us that the Prosecution's witnesses are unreliable.  And so, perhaps -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry, I haven't even heard the end of the question yet, but it started out in a very inappropriate manner.  And I think it needs to stop before it gets to the end. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I agree with Mr. Webster. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Well, Witness XBM, why don't you tell us then where you went after this meeting on Mount Muhe? 
A.	After the ceremony that took place on Mount Muhe -- well, had you asked me where we had gone at an earlier stage we would have moved forward far more quickly.  That surprises me because you planned to finish your cross-examination on Friday, which means that even if I were to give you all of the answers to your questions today or tomorrow, Thursday, you won't accept those answers.  So, you are planning to slow down proceedings.  And you have even just said that you are submitting on the part -- or making representations on the part of other counsel.  So it is difficult for you because -- 
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness -- 
THE WITNESS:
-- you can't say that you can -- 
JUDGE SHORT:
Stop making speeches. 
THE WITNESS:
-- actually think in their place. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Just answer the question and stop making speeches. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  I am going to follow your instructions.  However, you, who are used to listening to            Mr. Robinson, well, I would ask you, in order to expedite proceedings, to help me.  Since the beginning of my cross-examination, I think he could have finished his cross-examination within an hour.  And I think that the questions he could have asked in the space of an hour have been asked over the duration of one day.  And I had very important information to give to the Trial Chamber, and he seems to be deliberately avoiding the issue that affects me because we don't seem to understand each other. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness XBM, were I of a mind to delay proceedings I could find no greater ally than you because you don't answer questions, you simply make speeches.  

	My question is:  Where did you go after the meeting at Mount Muhe? 
A.	When we left Mount Muhe, we went to a place called Gishwati -- 
THE ENGLISH INTEPRETER:
Correction from the Kinyarwanda booth.  Kabari, excuse me. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Is that a trading centre? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And at that trading centre, can you tell us what happened?
A.	The market is located in that trading centre.  And livestock is taken there, and especially large livestock is taken to that location.  When we left Mount Muhe, Barayagwiza went to that location.  And on arriving, he assembled all of the people who had gone to the market and he then addressed those people who had gone there to buy cows, and told them not the pay the going price to the Tutsi, because, as he said, the cows that the Tutsi had come to sell were not their own.  And that if the Tutsi did have cows in their possession, they were not actually their own, and that everything that the Tutsi possessed belonged to the Hutus.  There was a disturbance, but it didn't last for very long.  There was another programme on the agenda. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, you know that we had indicated that when the Prosecutor was allowed to introduce this information, it was for a very limited purpose.  Now, material has now been introduced into testimony which we would not have allowed the Prosecutor to introduce.  You know, we are wondering whether your cross-examination is really too expansive on this subject. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, I understand that.  But the fact is that what you allowed the Prosecutor to elicit are events that didn't take place, in our opinion. So it doesn't help us to say that you are only going to consider them for the -- to determine the corroboration between the civilian authorities and the military authorities.  When the evidence is elicited that it is false, and that we can refute, then it becomes our duty to do that; not simply say, well this is evidence that they are only going to consider for that purpose because it is evidence that is not reliable in the first place.  So it is not the kind of thing that I can ignore.  So, I --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is not the point.  I mean, we understand that you are entitled to cross-examine on it, and to refute it, as you think best.  But we are just concerned now that a lot of information is now being introduced which would not normally be introduced in the Prosecution's case, but it is introduced.  And, you know, I'm not sure what else to say but to draw your attention to it, that we thought it was not necessary.  And that we are not certain in what way it assists.  We are not quite certain as of yet in what way it assist in the rebuttal that you are aiming at. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, it will assist when I bring witnesses to contradict what this witness has said about these events, then I would have given him a clear opportunity to have said what he wanted to say about these events.  And I will bring people to show that they didn't occur.  So, to me it is better to be clear with this witness,  and be complete then any detriment to my client from hearing -- having you hear this information.  But I understand your point.

Well, Mr. President, I'm about to ask the witness about another event that occurred at this location.  Would you want to take the break now?  
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, am I to understand that you have already investigated the occurrence or non-occurrence of these meetings, and you are sure that they never took place?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
With respect to the first meeting, I believe it did take place.  And as I indicated to you, the information that I had from the witness who testified at the Bagosora trial was that after the meeting, that what this witness claims took place at that bar did not take place.  And I didn't investigate it further, other than having researched the testimony that was given in rebuttal to his testimony in Bagosora case.  And to have information obtained from Mr. Barayagwiza himself.  So to that extent, that is the extent of my investigation of that particular meeting.  

With respect to the incident in Mount Muhe, again, my sources of information for this, are the             two people who he says were there, which is Mr. Nsengiyumva -- Colonel Nsengiyumva and Barayagwiza, who are here at the UNDF, as well as information I was able to find from the UNAMIR document and Mr. Serugendo's statement.  So, in the very short time that I have had since I became aware that the information was going to be allowed, although it was not in the pre-trial brief, I have done the best I could to amass the sources of information to lead me to believe that the events are not as this witness has stated.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will take the adjournment now.  

Mr. Witness, I will remind you as, I have done previously, that you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody during this or any other adjournment.  
(Court adjourned at 1729H)
