MADAM PRESIDENT:
The session begins.  Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. 

Mr. Roach, are you ready for your cross of this witness?  Could you bring in the witness, please? 
MR. ROACH:
I am prepared, but I understand, Madam President, that my friend Mr. Hooper has something to say. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Mr. Hooper, you have the floor.
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you, Madam President.  After we rose yesterday, Madam President, some matters came to my attention as a result of inquiries in Rwanda last night concerning this witness.  They're not lengthy.  They concern some events that he referred to in his evidence.  In fact, they don't go outside that evidence.  And they're matters that should properly be put to him.  The other matter is I have copies of his statement, clear copies, and again, given the resource that was made of that statement, the alleged contradictions within the statement, I'd ask that that statement be exhibited.  That's the statement dated 9th of February '98, in English and French.
(Witness entered courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Prosecutor, any objections on the motion from Mr. Hooper? 
MS. FALL:
No objection, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What is the current number of this document, registry?  

Very well.  Chamber does admit an exhibit from Defence, the statements made by Witness GII dated 9th of February 1998, in English and French.  The Court number is DR. 5, A and B.  DR. 5 A and B.  (Exhibit Nos. DR. 5A and DR. 5B admitted) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If there are no further motions.  Yes, I see you, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
It's only in respect of further questions. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Let's hear your questions.  How much time would you require? 
MR. HOOPER:
Fifteen minutes. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  You have the floor. 
WITNESS GII,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (Continued)
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  I'm going to pass up a piece of paper on which is written a name and then ask a question in respect of it.  The piece of paper is headed the 29th of April, '04.  Can you read and recognise that name, Mr. Witness?
A.	Yes, I do know this person.  But I must say that these names -- you are giving me these names.  You are not asking me any questions.  You are delaying me.  I want to go back home.
Q.	Well, maybe you do now, but that name that you see in front of you, is that the name of the person who owns the house that you're living in, the house or shop that you're living in?
A.	My house which was destroyed belonged to me.  I built it myself, sir.
Q.	The house you're living in now when you go back to Rwanda, that you've been living in. 
A.	The house I'm living in now, I also built it myself, sir.
Q.	Does that man whose name appears on that piece of paper have any -- any interest in that house that you're living in?  Let me put it another way:  Did he give you that house to live in?
A.	I told you that I am living in a house that I built myself.  I built my house.
Q.	Did that man give you a house as a price of his life?  That's the question:  Did that man give you a house as a price for his life?
A.	Let me explain this to you. 
MS. FALL:
Madam President, objection.  I do not see the relevance of all these questions so far as the issue at hand is concerned.  I do not see the relevance of these questions.
THE WITNESS:
Let me say something, if I may, Madam President. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness is insisting.  He is saying that yesterday, Defence insulted him, called him a murderer, househand, all sorts of names, and that it's a pity so far as witness is concerned because it has nothing to do with his testimony here.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, objection sustained.  Witness has answered.  He said he built that house.
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.  I move on. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I asked you about a camp called Makagote, and you told us you'd never heard of it at all.  Can I ask you this:  Do you know --
A.	I do not know that camp.  I didn't go there to seek refuge myself.
Q.	Do you know a place, a valley, just near ********, called Makagote?
A.	No, sir.  No, sir, I don't know that location.
Q.	The third matter I move to.  The two Tutsis who were badly beaten before being taken to the Kayanga health centre, I want to ask you a question about that.  You said yesterday, as I understood your evidence, and correct me if I'm wrong, that they were taken from Rusagara's house after being identified to soldiers by ******.  Is that correct?
A.	I think you know the circumstances you are talking about.  I think you talked about it with Rwamakuba.  Those people were killed in Kayanga.  Rwamakuba was probably there when they were killed.  When I raised that issue, I understood immediately that you knew of the circumstances surrounding them.  So you know what happened.
Q.	I'm asking you about this aspect of your evidence, that they were taken from Rusagara's house.  Is that correct or not?
A.	At the time I started talking about it, I realised that you already knew the circumstances surrounding that event.
Q.	Will you answer the question, please?  Are you saying they were taken from Rusagara's house?
A.	Yes, sir.
Q.	And was that after being identified there by ******; is that your evidence?
A.	Yes.  He was the one that bought the drinks for the soldiers and the soldiers subsequently beat him. 
Q.	Sorry, the soldiers beat who?
A.	The soldiers beat those persons, Rutembya and Rutembeza, who, as they used to say, were saved.  As they said, they were saved.  The person that told you this information didn't tell you that he dealt blows.
Q.	I'm sorry, the person who told me this information didn't tell me that he dealt blows.  Who is it?  Who are you talking about?
A.	A counter-informer.
Q.	I'm sorry, who?
A.	How did these persons die, according to your informer?  Whoever told you that those people were beaten, that subsequently they died, the person who told you must have told you also how those people died.
Q.	Is it right that those soldiers had been drinking at your bar with another man called Rutabagirwa, who was himself a Tutsi?  Is that right or not?
A.	That is not true.  If that person told you that, he lied.  It was ******'s place that they were drinking with.  It was ****** that sold them off to be killed.
Q.	I move on to the final subject.  You mentioned two names of other Tutsis who were killed.  I want to deal with them one by one.  The first one, Ntidendereza, Augustin, is that the name of a Tutsi you know?
A.	Yes, sir.  You asked me names of people that died that were living around *******.
Q.	Let me spell it, please.  That's N-T-I-D-E-N-D-E-R-E-Z-A, Augustin.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper.  Mr. Hooper, please, we did not hear the interpreter shout out (as interpreted) what you just said.  Could you kindly just make a pause just a few seconds between the answer from the answer and your new question.  If not, we'll find it difficult to follow you.  Could you just make a two seconds' pause?
MR. HOOPER:
Certainly. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	That man, Ntidendereza, Augustin, it's right, is it not, that he was killed in shellfire as a result of FAR troops firing on an RPF position?  Is that right?  Is that how, in fact, he died?
A.	Please, the person who told you misinformed you.  It was Interahamwe that killed him.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Just a minute.  We did not hear Mr. Hooper's question.  Could you kindly repeat your question, 
Mr. Hooper?  The interpreters were not able to translate what you said fully. 
MR. HOOPER:
Can I indicate that the answer to this question was that no, it was the Interahamwe that killed him.  And the question was:  Is it right that Augustin Ntidendereza was in fact killed when he was caught in shellfire fired by FAR troops on an RPF position?  The answer to that was, as I said, no, he was killed by Interahamwe. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	The second question concerning -- concerning people of the Tutsi ethnic group killed that you've mentioned was  Kankindi, K-A-N-K-I-N-D-I, a woman, and you mentioned her, I think, yesterday as having been killed.  Is that right, first of all?
A.	That is correct.  That is right.  He (sic) was killed, buried -- she was killed and buried.
Q.	And who buried her?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, did you follow?  You must just give us one or two seconds between questions and answers.  This is how we work here.  Because if we cannot understand the question clearly that you put, it would be of no avail to us sitting here.  Try to put your questions clearly and please just wait for the witness to answer, that the end is translated, for you to go on to another question, because the interpreter is finding it very, very difficult to follow the quick pace.
MR. HOOPER:
The difficulty is I'm giving it five seconds or so after the English finishes, but I'm getting -- the French is obviously running on and I'm not plugged into the French interpretation.  That's where the error occurs.  I get the pause but it's not sufficient to cover the French translation, and I'll bear that in mind.  That's the difficulty I have.  
Let me ask the question.  The witness had responded to my query as to whether it was right that Kankindi had been killed, and he said yes, she was killed and buried, as I understand it.  My question was:  Who buried her? 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And your answer, please, Mr. Witness?
A.	She was buried by those who killed her, Joas and Co.; that is the president and chairman of Power wing at ********.  He was the president of the Power wing and he was the one who buried her. 
Q.	Is that something you witnessed at all?
A.	No, sir.  No, sir.  I got the information because that person and the victim were neighbours.  Those who killed her didn't come from far.  They were neighbours, Rwamakuba and Joas and Co., who incited the population and then encouraged them to kill their neighbours.  That is what happens. 
Q.	And who was your informant for that information of her death and burial?
A.	It was one of those girls, one of the survivor girls that I met during the war.  She told me that she was killed and told me the circumstances surrounding her death.  And later on, when we went away from the refugee camp, we were able to talk to people who said it was those people who killed them, and moreover those killers that are now in prison do confess what they have done.  They are accusing people that have assisted them in killing -- assisting them in the killing exercise, sir.
Q.	And the name of this girl who told you this?  You've been given time to think.
MS. FALL:
Madam President.  Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecutor.
MS. FALL:
I am sorry, madam.  May I object at this line of question again?  These questions are not relevant, madam. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Would you kindly respond, Mr. Hooper?   
THE WITNESS:
Madam President, in response to Mr. Hooper's question, I should like to beg you to ask this gentleman to give -- put questions concerning Rwamakuba.  All these other questions have nothing to do with the trial.  I've just spent three weeks here.  I would like to go back home because I have things to do at home.  If we are not going to finish this testimony today, I will not come back to this courtroom.  I am telling you that I am ready to answer questions.  But I see that he's harassing me; he's insulting me, and I'm not ready to take that.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, Witness.  Witness, you are here to answer -- you are here to answer questions.  We do understand that you may be overwhelmed by some questions which sometimes have been repeated and which may appear to you not to be relevant, but it is your responsibility to answer questions.  If you do not know the answers, say you do not know. 

Please, try to answer as shortly as possible because you also have the tendency to talk a little bit too much.  Answer shortly, succinctly.  Given a question, say what you know.  If you don't know, say you don't know.  Don't discuss anything.
THE WITNESS:
Very well, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes Prosecutor.
MR. WEBSTER:
Madam President, with all due respect for the Court, I certainly do not mean to go against Your Honour's instructions, but we need to put this in context.  The Defence has a tendency to conduct its investigations through the process of cross-examination.  That's not what cross-examination is supposed to accomplish.  This witness has been very patient; he's answered the questions.  If he's developing things it's because Mr. Hooper is going in all sorts of directions that have nothing to do with the substance of the allegations in this indictment.  If Mr. Hooper has a defence that has to do with the RPF troops and killings that he's alleging that this man was involved in, that has nothing to do with the indictment.  It is not a legitimate defence in view of the allegations in this indictment, and somehow we have to keep these cross-examinations within reasonable bounds.  It really becomes abusive to the  witness after a certain point.  So I would very respectfully ask the Trial Chamber to bear that in mind.  

All of these witnesses travel, they extract themselves from their communities.  They're here for weeks on end to experience what they seem to interpret as abuse, and given their cultural context and their unfamiliarity with these types of judicial procedures, it's understandable in context.  So if the Court would please take a careful look at the line of questioning that's being pursued, perhaps we can bring this to a close.  Thank you. 
JUDGE ARREY:
I think I'm completely in agreement with what the Prosecutor has said.  I think this cross-examination has really gone way beyond the legal limit of cross-examination.  Because it appears you spoke to your client yesterday, that's why you have come back.  If he was sitting beside you, perhaps this needn't have occurred.  So please keep to the limit of cross-examination.  We are going way beyond it. 
MR. HOOPER:
I didn't speak to the client yesterday.  I didn't visit him in the UNDF.  I've had information from Rwanda, and it's that information I'm putting.  My client isn't in a position to help me about these allegations.  I'm getting the information from elsewhere.  

In terms of relevance, we are essentially concerned with the killing of Tutsis.  This man has said there was killing of Tutsis.  He's named a number, and we seek to contradict what he's saying about this.  

Now, he said that he had heard information that Kankindi had been killed and buried by Joas and Co., and that is contrary to my position.  And he said that he had an informant, a girl, and I've asked him if he can name her.  Now, that's not conducting my inquiries through this witness.  It's a reasonable question in terms of what he said, directly on the issue of the death of Tutsis.  It's relevant.  

Now, the question I asked -- and he may have an answer -- is who was his informant that witnessed the death of Kankindi and related it to him, and the burial; and it's a one-word answer.  And we've spent ten minutes on it.  May the witness respond to this?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, do you have anything to add to what you've said already?  In terms of your informant, you spoke of the daughter of the victim.  Yes, please, go ahead. 
THE WITNESS:
Her name is Mukarusagara.  She was the daughter of the victim.  She died, and I knew about it on that same day.  It was her neighbours who killed her.  It wasn't foreigners or strangers who came from far away.  It was her neighbours who killed her.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I suggest that lady was killed by the Bakiga, B-U-K-I-G-A (sic); that is the displaced persons from the north.  And that is my last question on this subject. 
A.	Listen, please.  I would like to ask you a question.  I do acknowledge that the Bakiga left Byumba and that they were in our area.  We spent two years together.  The Abakiga did not kill anyone.  Work was given to them and they did the work and they were paid, but they were displaced persons.  If the Abakiga indeed participated in the massacres, it was because they were incited to do so.  Apart from the fact that this specific individual was not killed by the Abakiga, but the Abakiga did live with us in harmony for two years.  We were helping them.  They were refugees and there were no problems between them and us, right up until the beginning of the war.
Q.	My final matter is this:  You felt that I'd insulted you by putting to you that you were a murderer, as well as a home help.  Do you find those equally insulting allegations?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we have told you that you cannot go back to those questions. 
THE WITNESS:
I would like to tell you that this information you get from where, I do not know.  You are only trying to defend your client, but that will not change the fact that he is the one who incited the people to kill others.  The killers of that woman, Kankindi, are in prison today and amongst them there were no Bakiga, for your information.
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The next counsel is Mr. Roach for cross-examination.  Is that correct?  You have the floor, Mr. Roach. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Good morning, sir. 
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	I know you are anxious to return home, so I will be just a few minutes.  But have you had occasion 
to --
A.	Counsel, I would like to ask you not to have me repeat everything I've said in terms of your questions.  Maybe if it's something concerning Mr. Rwamakuba.  I really want to leave this place.  I would thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you have not as yet been asked any question.  Please wait for the questions before you answer or say anything.  Please stay calm and be cool.  Answer the questions that are put to you. 
THE WITNESS:
Very well, Madam President. 
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Sir, have you had an opportunity to review the statement that you gave to the investigators?
A.	No, I have not had to review that declaration, that statement.  It's something that I believe in.  It's a statement which I myself made.
Q.	I see.  And before you signed the statement, did you read it?
A.	This statement was written in French and I cannot read French.
Q.	Did anyone read it back to you before you signed it?
A.	This document was read to me and I realised that it did indeed match what I had stated, after which I signed the document.
Q.	Well, sir, the document seems to have in it certain things which you gave testimony to which were quite different and, in particular, it begins that you met Dr. André Rwamakuba at meetings, and you told us that that is not correct.  Further, it says that you met him on the 10th or 11th of April 1994.  You agree with that, but you also stated that you saw him before that, maybe on the 4th or 5th of April, and you said you told the investigators, but that is not included in the statement.  And finally, the statement says that there were bags on the back seat of the car, and you said that's not what you said. Now, sir, do you know how these discrepancies come about or came about?
A.	I'm going to answer you as follows.  It was because of the questions asked of me by the Defence Counsel who has just finished concerning meetings or rallies organised by the MDR in our area.  I told him that it was a while ago, I couldn't remember, and also since I was not a member of that party.  Actually, when you talk about political rallies, there are many people who gather about in a place.  That is generally what I understand by that term. Now, with regard to the split that occurred within the MDR, this was organised.  It was orchestrated by young persons who gathered here and there, youths who would meet here and there.  I don't think we should dwell on disparities concerning terms used.  I know that people would come and meet at ******'s house, but when you refer to rallies, these are places at which hundreds of people gather.  So the message is not changing as such.  Maybe there's a problem with the term -- the terms "meetings" or "rallies" but that does not change the message that I'm trying to transmit. As for the bags, I spoke about the boot, and if mention was made of a back seat, that was wrong.  This is something which is opened and things are put inside.  I was speaking in Kinyarwanda, and I'm sure you recall that. 
Q.	Yes.  So the statement that we are talking about was made in 1998, approximately six years ago, and I would suggest to you that your memory of the events would have been better six years ago than it is today.  Would you agree with that?
A.	I have answered questions which were put to me, and I think I'm repeating the same thing right now.  Because one cannot forget things of which one was a witness, in fact, especially with regard to events which are of a certain scope.
Q.	So you don't agree with me that your memory would have been better four years after the incident rather than today, ten years after the incident?
A.	I think that during my testimony I spoke of what I knew.  I have not changed my statement, apart from the few questions which were probably meant to mislead me concerning my status as a domestic help and other qualifiers which have been used in my regard.  I don't know, but I have maintained the statement which I made earlier.
Q.	If that's your answer, I'll move on.  Now, would you agree that ******** centre is about -- or less than 20 kilometres from the centre of Kigali city?
A.	It must be more than it that.  No.  No, I think that if you're coming from Kigali to go to Kajevuba, it's about 25, 28 kilometres and that's up to Kajevuba.  And then there are hills and so on and so forth.  I don't know how I would be able to measure that in terms of kilometres.
Q.	Okay.  But from the hills of Gikomero, one may be able to see the city of Kigali; is that correct?
A.	If you've been there, Counsel, I think you would have seen that for yourself.
Q.	Are you agreeing with me that you can see the city of Kigali from Gikomero hills?  Are you agreeing with that?
A.	I have not done that research.  At ******** and *******, that's where I live.  As for Gicaca hills, I don't know.  I have not been on those hills in order to verify that fact.
Q.	You see, we have some photographs which seem to indicate that, and I just wanted to get some clarification.  But if you don't know and you can't say, that's fine.  

Now, were you aware that on the 6th of April 1994, that there were RPF troops in Kigali at the CND?
A.	I heard mention of that made and I heard that information from the radio also.
Q.	I see.  And to the best of your knowledge, when did the Inkotanyi or RPF troops enter and take control of Gikomero?
A.	I fled on the 13th, and that's what I've said.  On the 14th, the Inkotanyi passed by there and they were on their way towards Kigali.  On the 15th, that's when I saw the soldiers in that area.  It's at that point in time that they took us away to Rutare.
Q.	Now, when did you return to your home area after having fled?  What was the date?
A.	I have answered this question, Counsel.  These questions have been put to me by the previous counsel.  I think this is merely delaying the proceedings.  I said that it was in July that I came back from the refugee camp.  Unless the exercise is to repeat everything that I have said.
Q.	No.  Witness, I will ask you to be patient.  In cross-examination, you are examined for consistency of your testimony, so be patient, and if you can help us with the date that you returned.  You said July, but was it in mid July or early July or late July, when?
A.	At that time people were disturbed.  You know, there had been killings, massacres.  It would be a lie for me to tell you that I remembered a date.  We were told at a given point in time that we could go back home.  I didn't need to know the date.  The date that I cannot forget is the date when I fled, the day when the killings started in my area.  As for the date on which I returned home, I cannot remember it.  I do remember the month, however.
Q.	Well, that's fine.  I thought you were good at dates because you remembered the dates when you saw Rwamakuba, so -- but if you don't know, that is fine.  You cannot tell us whether it was the middle or the end or the beginning of July?
A.	Even if I were able to remember, I don't know whether that would serve any purpose for this Court because I do not have the impression that this would be of any use to this Court.
Q.	Now, Witness, I thought I would be a short time with you because you were answering your questions very directly at the beginning, but this morning I may be longer if you do not answer my questions directly. 

My next question is, was your testimony that the people fled, the residents of Gikomero, fled when the Inkotanyi arrived?
A.	I've been asked questions about Rwamakuba, about examination-in-chief.  I was not asked about refugees fleeing.
Q.	But is that your recollection, that people fled?  In the cross-examination, I have in my notes that people fled when the Inkotanyi arrived.  Was that your testimony?
A.	I know that I fled when the killings started, but it's true that the Inkotanyi were fighting with their FARs, and I don't think the residents would have been standing by watching.  They fled.  They fled from the area.
Q.	Yes.  Now, you told us that you had heard on the radio, following the president's death, that persons should stay at home, stay indoors.  I believe that was your testimony.  Now --
A.	Yes, that is indeed what I said.
Q.	Yes.  But did you and did other people -- this is two questions -- did you and others stay indoors or did you not follow that request?
A.	I don't think that's a question worthy of an answer.  In fact, I've answered this question.  I've already mentioned this aspect.
Q.	On the 6th --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, please try and answer the questions that are being put to you.  I think we'll go about this much faster if you answer the questions put to you.
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	So, Witness, I will ask you again.  We are talking about the --
A.	People remained at home because furthermore we didn't even have anywhere to go.
Q.	Now, between the 6th of April 1994 and when you left around the 13th, between that period of time, were there -- was there much activity in the streets?
A.	Rather, there were disturbances and people were not going about their ordinary chores.  They were not tilling their farms, as was normal.
Q.	Now, just generally, did people if Gikomero who were of Tutsi background and of Hutu background live in relative, peaceful circumstances before the 6th of April?
A.	Yes, they were living in harmony.  You know, in Rwandan culture, people exchange cows.  This is done across the different ethnic groups.  They would give their daughters in marriage, and this happened between the two -- the two cultures.
Q.	I see.  And did you, yourself, have many friends or any relations who were Hutu?
A.	Yes, in fact, my neighbours were only Hutus.  We shared everything.
Q.	There were not many people who were Tutsi in the area of Gikomero where you lived; is that correct?
A.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the evidence [pages 11 to 12] has been extracted, and filed under seal) 
Q.	Very well.  Now, you told us with respect to the two Tutsis who were killed, you told us that at one point they were being protected by either gendarmes or by the soldiers.  Do you recall that testimony?
A.	Regarding those people who were delivered by ****** to be killed, they were from *******, but people who were protected were those who came from *******.  Those who were in the Power wing wanted to go kill people.  Soldiers -- a commander of the soldiers on site, asked that those assailants be separated or brought aside; shoot in the air so that that they would be dispersed and brought aside.
Q.	But was your testimony that after the two individuals were beaten, they were taken to the hospital and protected?  They were protected for some period of time.  Was that your testimony?
A.	No, you misunderstood me, Counsel.  I said that ****** bought beer for the soldiers and the people were beaten.  Their colleagues, Christians, brought them to the hospital.  A couple days later, the general massacres started.  The attackers went to the hospital and finished off the people who had been beaten and they also killed their caretakers.  So, in fact, four people were killed.
Q.	Very well.  Now, I believe you said in your testimony that you were keeping an eye out for important people like Rwamakuba who would come after the president's death.  Do you recall that testimony?
A.	Yes, I remember.  Each time I would see a car, I would tell myself perhaps they're Interahamwe inside.  Perhaps they're going to start burning houses.  Yes, I did observe and I did say that.  I maintain that still now.
Q.	Yes.  Well, was that as a result of the president's death you thought that they would be angry and come out and kill people?
A.	No.  After the president's death and before the person we're talking about came to sensitise people to kill, we had no problems.  In fact, there weren't many MRND members in our area.  Perhaps there were MDR or PSD members, and members of another party, the liberal party.  Those were really the parties that were represented in our area.  There were flags put up here and there, and there were no killings.  But, later on, these people that we spoke about here in this courtroom who came to sensitise people, after they did that, we started to have problems.
Q.	But before the president's death, you did not particularly keep an eye on the vehicles that were coming into your area.  It was only after the president's death.  That was your testimony; is that correct?
A.	Yes.  Particularly during that period.  But before, he would do that.  But after, it was more particular.  There was a split in the party.  After the split, you could start to see that there were problems.
Q.	Very well.  I have just a few more questions for you, Witness, and one has to do with the Interahamwe.  Now, you told us that you were keeping an eye out for persons who might be Interahamwe.  You just said that.  Well, were there Interahamwe groups organised in Gikomero, as far as you know?
A.	There were.  Those are the same Interahamwe who joined up with the members of the Power wing.  And together they killed people.
Q.	Yes.  But you said the MRND was not very strong in your area of Gikomero.  You also said that the Liberals and the CDR, I believe, were the ones who were powerful in your area.  So you were saying that the Interahamwe were connected to these two parties?  Is that what you're saying now?
A.	Later on, the Interahamwe joined the members of the Power wing and members of the CDR.  They sensitised the entire population, to such an extent that even our neighbours were convinced that they had to loot, kill.  At least, some of them were convinced and they followed them. 
Q.	Yes, I understand what you are saying about the sensitising and to kill.  So you don't need to keep repeating "sensitising" and "to kill".  I'm asking you, are you saying that the Interahamwe was connected to the Liberals and the CDR parties in Gikomero?  Is that what you're saying?
A.	There was the liberal party and the Power wing.  There was a Power wing within the MDR and within the CDR.  If my memory serves me well, all of those people came together and brought about the mass killings of people.
Q.	Well, did you see for yourself in your area persons who you identified as Interahamwe?
A.	I could see those people when they would go to meetings.  Vehicles came from Kigali and there was Bikindi and others who were aboard those vehicles.  They came through our areas.  They went to ******** secteur office, sensitised the population.  And after their meetings, they went back home.  Consequently, even within the commune, there was a chairman of the MRND.  There were leaders of the Interahamwe.  And they were in the commune. 
Q.	And who was the chairman of the MRND in your commune?
A.	I'm not sure but it must have been an accountant, a man called Maurice, who was bourgmestre at one point in time in the commune.  At one point in time, he was bourgmestre.
Q.	And who were involved with the Interahamwe in your commune?
A.	Members of the MRND, young people, the youth wing affiliated to the MRND party.  That youth wing was called the Interahamwe.
Q.	Yes, I know.  Witness, I am representing an Accused person who was at one point the national president of the MRND party.  And I am particularly interested in what you have to say about the MRND and, in particular, the -- this person who you said was an accountant by the name of Maurice.  Do you not have a last name for that person?
A.	In fact, the accountant for the commune who had been bourgmestre of the commune at one point in time, in fact, his name was Celestin Mulisa.  Mulisa, M-U-L-I-S-A.  Mulisa, first name, Celestin. 
Q.	And these young persons who you told us about who came out of the meetings at ******'s place and boasted about killing -- or their plans to kill, were these people you referred to as Interahamwe?
A.	No.  Those young people belonged to the Power wing.
Q.	Because those are the only young people you told us about.  Were there other young people that you are telling us about now or just these?
A.	I was telling you that the young people who boasted about what was going on, they had a meeting at ******'s.  Those young people were members of the Power wing. 
Q.	And, as far as you know, they had no connection to the Interahamwe?
A.	The link with those young people was in fact the killings.  They belonged to different political parties, but during the massacres, they did collaborate.
Q.	Just one moment, please. 
Mr. Witness, you'll be pleased to know that I have no further questions. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you, Madam President. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Counsel. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  

Counsel Sow, you have the floor. 
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Madam President.  Good morning, Madam President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  Good morning to the Prosecution.  Good morning to the witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Counsel.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, I have a few questions for you, just ten minutes, and it will only take ten minutes, if you help me, in briefly answering the questions I put to you. 

Now, Witness, you said during your examination-in-chief on 22nd April, Thursday, when you were asked what happened in Rwanda on the 6th of April 1994, you said there was an accident with the head of state's plane.  You were asked how did you hear about that.  You said you heard about it on the radio.  Witness, can you tell me exactly what was said during that radio announcement?
A.	Well, I turned my radio on in the morning and I heard an announcement saying that President Habyarimana's plane had fallen.  At that same time, I heard in the announcement them say that everyone had to remain at home.
Q.	Witness, did the radio announcement say why the plane went down?
A.	No, they did not explain that.  They didn't say who shot it down.
Q.	Witness, what was your reaction when you learned of the news of your president's death?
A.	I concluded that it was an accident, just like many other accidents.  I believed that they were going to place another president to take -- to replace President Habyarimana.  I had no other ideas.  I didn't think that the killings would begin after that president's death.
Q.	Witness, when you gave a statement to Prosecution investigators, you said that "The killers began with my own home, which was completely destroyed."  Do you maintain that statement, Witness?
A.	Yes, I maintain what is said in that statement because that house was completely destroyed.  When I came back from the refugee camp, the house was completely destroyed. 
Q.	Witness, let me rephrase my question.  It seems you did not quite understand it.  You yourself said that the killers began "with my own house", in your own words.  That means you were present at the time when they began to destroy your house; is that correct?
A.	Well, when I realised that machetes had been distributed, I immediately went behind my house.  I took refuge in a sorghum field.  I discreetly hid in that field, and I heard gunshots at my door.  They were knocking my door down, taking off the roof, and I realised that they were attacking my house.  When I saw that, I realised that mine was the first to be attacked.
Q.	Very well.  Now, on the 22nd of April, last Thursday, during your evidence-in-chief, you were asked, "When did you learn your house was burned?"  You said, "I learned of that upon my return from the place where I was taking refuge."  Now, how do you put that statement with what you said in your written statement?  How do you reconcile the two?
A.	Counsel, there's no contradiction.  I heard those people knocking down my door.  I didn't know they were going to completely destroy my house on that day.  But when I came back from the refugee camp, at that point I realised and was sure at that point that my house indeed was completely destroyed.
Q.	Now still on the 22nd of April, you said that the victims were numerous and many people were killed with machetes, others were thrown into the river.  Which river were you speaking of, Witness, when you said that?
A.	Yes, I did speak of things that I was told upon my return from the refugee camp.  I was told that five people were killed, as well as Augustin, and that is five people in all.  But in ********, I know that many Tutsis were killed.  In Kayanga as well.  Women and elderly women were thrown into the river.  Some of them were killed by machete.  Others were brought to Lake Muhazi.
Q.	Witness, I asked you the following question:  Which river were you speaking of?
A.	It's Lake Muhazi.  That's a lake located between Giti and Gikomero communes.
Q.	Witness, you also spoke of orders that ****** gave and you said that you saw ****** giving orders.  I can understand that you hear instructions or orders.  Can you tell us, how did you see him give orders?  How did you know, by looking at him, that he indeed was giving orders?
A.	He gave them machetes and certainly he was giving them orders so that they'd go and kill with them.  Even upon my return from the refugee camp, I was told that people wanted to start by destroying people's homes.  And even ****** told them, "No.  You must first start to kill the owners of those homes before anything else." 
Q.	Witness, let me get back to my question.  You said that you saw him give orders.  So from that I must suppose that you didn't hear any orders.  You were only supposing he was giving orders, assuming he was giving orders. 
A.	Yes.  I figure that he was giving orders.  I saw him distributing machetes.  Can someone distribute machetes without saying anything, Counsel? 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.
A.	Thank you, Counsel. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson, do you intend to cross-examine this witness? 
MR. ROBINSON:
No, thank you, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you.  I wanted to ask that all information regarding the elderly woman killed and any members of the family mentioned by the witness be expunged from the record because these people, if they're from the same cellule as the witness, talk of them might reveal this witness's identity. 

Counsel for the Prosecution, do you have any re-examination for this witness? 
MS. FALL:
I do, Madam President.  I thank you, and I will be very brief. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, very well, Counsel.  You may proceed.
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	I have a few questions for you, just so that we can focus our attention on what is essential.  I will ask you very specific questions and I will ask you to be very brief in response to those questions.  

Witness, do you confirm seeing André Rwamakuba between the 5th -- the 4th and 5th April during a meeting in which he was seeking new members for the MDR Power Movement?
A.	Yes, I confirm that.
(Pages 1 to 16 by Karen Holm-Porter)













	1030H
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, do you confirm seeing André Rwamakuba park his vehicle in front of ******'s house on that day? 
A.	I confirm that.  I saw him park his vehicle in front of ******'s.
Q.	Witness, do you confirm seeing, on that day, since you were in front of your shop, did you see André Rwamakuba and others offload bags from the vehicle and put them at ******'s place? 
A.	Yes.  I did see that.  That was between the 10th and 11th of April.
Q.	Witness, do you confirm seeing that there were machetes in the bags because those machetes were being distributed? 
A.	I did see the bags, and I did notice that they were identical to the bags that I had seen previously. 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, I heard my learned colleague say that she was going to ask specific questions with specific answers for those questions.  I didn't hear her say that she was going to ask leading questions.  The questions that she just put to the witness is leading, in the sense that the -- there is a deduction between the bags seen on the first day and the second day where there was distribution.  There were two answers for only one question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Fall, any response? 
MS. FALL:
I don't remember if Mr. Hooper (sic) was there during the examination-in-chief, but I believe that all of the questions that are put to the witness right now are only to confirm what was said during the 
	cross-examination and the examination-in-chief, questions that seek clarification from questions put to the witness during cross-examination.  That is all this is.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  I believe that we can move on. 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, I wanted to specify that Mr. Weyl made the objection and not Mr. Hooper. 

Mr. Hooper, did you have something to say? 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  The question, the leading question, did not, as Ms. Fall purports, in fact reflect what was said in chief, because in chief, on the 22nd of April, to the question, "Can you tell us or can you confirm for us that those bags with the machetes were indeed the same bags that were unloaded from the vehicle?" the answer given was, "The bags looked very much alike and so I concluded they were the same ones."  Somewhat different. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  You may proceed. 
MS. FALL:
I didn't finish, Madam President.  Probably Defence should have waited for me to finish.  I was going to raise that issue raised by Mr. Hooper, and I'm sorry for having named Mr. Weyl Mr. Hooper.  That was a mistake on my part, I'm sorry. 
MR. WEYL:
There is nothing bad about that, my dear.
MS. FALL:
 I do appreciate your gentle behaviour, learned friend.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Now, Witness, let me repeat the question to you.  Do you confirm having only known at the time of distribution that those bags contained machetes, only at that time? 
A.	Yes, ma'am.  It was at that time that I really saw that those bags contained machetes.
Q.	Now, Witness, do you confirm that you said that at the time you saw those bags at distribution, you said that those bags resembled those that were dropped at ******'s by André Rwamakuba?  Did they resemble each other? 
A.	I do confirm that, Madam.
Q.	Now, Witness, do you confirm that those machetes, those machetes that were taken out of those bags, were used to kill Tutsi from your commune? 
A.	I do confirm that, ma'am.  They distributed those machetes to the people, the local people.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper.
MR. HOOPER:
There has been the clearest testimony from this witness that this witness fled and had no eyewitness view of anything that happened, and so to seek that kind of confirmation through the witness is not appropriate. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Objection sustained. 
MS. FALL:
Most obliged, Madam President.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, do you confirm that those machetes that you saw distributed by ****** to people who went to kill Tutsi, according to you, those machetes, were they part and parcel of the machetes that were in the bag dropped at ******'s by André Rwamakuba? 
A.	Yes, yes, ma'am.  They were the same machetes. 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Madam President.  No further questions. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  I believe our witness is rather fatigued.  We can therefore release him and thank him for having testified before this Trial Chamber.  We wish him a very good trip back home and we should like the Prosecutor to say whether the next witness is here.  It must be GIM (sic).  Is the --
MR. WEBSTER:
I understand that (Microphone not activated) ... in the waiting room. 

I think the witness wanted to thank the Court.  Is that it? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please. 

Yes, indeed, the witness wanted to thank the Court and the President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you.  
	(Witness excused)
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I don't want to slow the proceedings down --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor? 
	(Witness entered courtroom)
MR. WEBSTER:
-- but I would like to make a comment to the Court as we are waiting for the witness to be brought in.  

	Our concern is to complete the testimony of GIN and GIT before we adjourn next Thursday, and with that in mind, I'd like the Trial Chamber and the parties to consider sitting tomorrow, if we don't complete the direct examination of GIN today.  My concern is really logistic because we have brought several witnesses from Rwanda for their testimony, expecting them all to complete their testimony this session.  Clearly, that's not going to happen.  Some witnesses will have to be sent back and brought again, and I don't want GIT to be included in that bunch, so we have to complete GIN and GIT before we break next Thursday.  And with that in mind, I'm asking the Trial Chamber to consider sitting tomorrow, if we do not complete the direct testimony of GIN today, and to consider sitting next Friday, if we do not complete the cross-examination of GIT by then.  We are way behind schedule.  Even after changing and abbreviating the schedule, we are still behind in our abbreviated rescheduling, so somehow we have to move these things along.  

	I want justice to be done.  I'm not trying to compromise the Prosecution or the Defence, but we would like to complete at least two additional witnesses before next Friday.  So if the Court would bear that in mind, and perhaps the parties could comment on it after we come back from the break because I would like us to move ahead as quickly --
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I can comment on it now, I think, with respect, Madam President.  First of all, there is a matter of law --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, we were asking you to listen a little.  You just took the floor without you being given the floor.  Now you have the floor.  What -- please be patient. 
MR. HOOPER:
I was trying to, in fact, ask that the witness -- I've been stood up and down for quite a while.  I've been trying to get the witness not brought in, because there is a matter of law concerning her testimony, first of all, and I didn't want the witness inconvenienced by that. 

Secondly, as I understand it, as of next week, we are sitting all day, and if that's correct, I foresee no difficulty in completing these witnesses by Thursday. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl? 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, I think I should remind the Chamber that yesterday you rendered a decision of a compromise to allow the Defence the time refused to it by the Prosecutor.  Now, if we are going to waste our time, taking our time, in the face of trials that we are not -- trials that we are not supposed to be -- is giving by one hand and taking it by the other.  Now, this Friday, if you take it away from us, please look at your decision again and allow us to continue our cross up to the 10th of May, but this is -- this is not the way of working  Mr. Webster is trying to impose upon us.
MR. WEBSTER:
(Overlapping microphones) ... after the close of the session this morning because I don't want to take the time away from this witness's testimony.  So I'll surrender the floor to my colleague Madam Makwaia, and we can come back to this at 1:30. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now, let's remind ourselves that we will hear the examination-in-chief of this witness.  The cross will come later.  And in our decision yesterday we established a date.  Now, I should like to remind one and all that we will be sitting morning and afternoon next month.  We will be sitting, throughout the month of May, morning and afternoon.  This will allow us to catch up.  Thank you. 

Mr. Hooper, would you like to take the floor? 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  And sitting, as we will, all day, we will finish both those witnesses that Mr. Webster has concern about quite easily, I'd have thought, next week. 

I have an application to make in respect of this witness's testimony, and before she is sworn, before she dons any earphones, I'd like to make my submission or motion.  It concerns the notice of additional evidence which the Court will have, and in particular, paragraph 10 and paragraph 11 of the document dated and filed the 23rd of April 2004. 

You will recall what the witness says in that statement, but it may assist, if you have it, to turn it up and refresh your memories of its contents.  It concerns events at the health centre mentioned there.  It relates what a brigadier related to her husband and others.  And she places that event subsequent to the events concerning the Accused and the tearing up of certificates.  That's paragraph 10. 

I don't know if you have it.  Do you have it, Madam President, this document?  Because it's quite a -- I'm alluding to it rather than reading it. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We do not have that document. 
MR. HOOPER:
I think it's very important that you have it.  I can't really make this submission, which is to seek to exclude that portion of evidence at this stage, and you will need it.  I only have an English copy that may be marked.  I can pass that up to you, but if the Prosecution have some copies of the French document, then obviously that would do very much better.  

	Does anyone have such a document? 
MS. MAKWAIA:
I do have the document in English.  It's my copy.  It's annotated, Your Honours.  It was served on court management for distribution to the parties and, I would have thought, to Your Honours.  We do not yet have any French translation of the document. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I don't think I can make this application properly -- I think you need to see the document, and I'm surprised it hasn't been translated into French.  If the witness can withdraw, I can read the document to you and it will be translated into French.  But it may be convenient if the witness withdraw.  I see the time.  It will probably take us five or ten minutes to deal with this, and if I was to respectfully suggest you took the break then, then this witness can commence her testimony immediately afterwards, at about 10 past or quarter past eleven.  I don't know if that's a helpful suggestion. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, do you have anything to add?  I see you standing. 
MR. HOOPER:
To add to -- well, I suggested very briefly that if you don't have copies in French, that -- and you need them, I know -- the alternative is for me to read out what is said on the statements, and they can be translated then, but I would like the witness to leave the Court, or alternatively it may be an idea that she does -- it's going to take us ten minutes or so, perhaps 15, to deal with the matter.  And then we will be up to eleven o'clock.  If we took our break then, then we could perhaps continue with the witness immediately afterwards and she wouldn't be so inconvenienced. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We understood that, you had said that, so we shall therefore take a break now. 

Witness, we are very sorry.  You will have to come back a little bit later.  We shall take our break, which will allow --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the witness does not have an earphone, so she is not hearing what you are saying. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, that is not very serious.  This will be explained to her.  Well, she can therefore don her earphones.  Give her the earphones. 

Witness, we had a little bit of housekeeping to do.  We are taking a break at this time, and then later on, you will come back to the courtroom to testify.  We are very sorry about this little mishap. 
(Witness stood down)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We shall now rise and come back in about 15 minutes. 
(Court recessed from 1050H to 1117H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are resumed.  We apologise for the tardiness.  We had some verifications to take care of and that took us a bit of time. 

Mr. Hooper, we recognise you. 
MR. HOOPER:
Merci, Madam President.  Thank you, Madam President.  Yes, the time was taken up with providing you with the document, and I hope you have it before you now.  Can I start by very briefly referring you to the evidence in the statement that this witness provided, dated the 3rd of February, '98, and which you may have refreshed your memories from already, prior to coming into Court today?  Just very quickly, glancing at that, you will see that she starts by saying that in April, '94, she was at home in Gikomero secteur, a specific place, and not to be confused about Gikomero commune, the larger area of which Gikomero secteur is just one small part.  And in the second paragraph, in the English version, she says, "I know Dr. André Rwamakuba for I saw him driving his car many times."  She then describes events on the 12th.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Madam President, excuse me for the interruption, but I'm a bit uneased by the manner of proceeding by Counsel Hooper.  He's beginning to discuss the potential evidence that you shall be hearing from this witness.  If he's perceiving any omissions, he will have the opportunity to cross-examine this witness, Your Honours.  It is my submission he should not be allowed to discuss the contents of this statement prior to you hearing the witness's oral evidence and any explanations that she may be able to offer to you. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I'm acting --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Objection sustained. 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm really acting on the basis that you have the statements available to you and that you can, or have, read them. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
I think Your Honours have made the ruling.  Can Counsel proceed to other matters? 
MR. HOOPER:
And so I'll move, in fact, from the statement, which was merely an introduction by way of compare and contrast, to the document which was served on me, dated the 23rd of April 2004, notice of additional evidence pursuant to Rule 67(D).  You'll appreciate I received that, as you know, Friday afternoon, less than a week ago. 

First of all, I appreciate, as I understand it, that this was as a result of the witness being seen here on arrival in Arusha fairly recently and the product of that was this statement.  And I thank Ms. Makwaia for complying with the Rules.  She is a beacon in that respect to the Prosecution team.  But the difficulty arises in respect of paragraph 10 and 11, and those do need, because of the submission which I'm making, to have this evidence excluded, cut out from the witness's testimony, which is the motion I'm making now, you need to look at that.  I referred to the earlier statement because -- merely to clearly identify a principal issue here, and that is, at no time ever, in any of this witness's opportunity of testimony --
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, if I may interrupt one more time, because I am failing so far to see the basis of Counsel's request to exclude this evidence.  Your Honours will recall, on the 27th of April, this month, Counsel Hooper made his application to you when he was served with this additional information pursuant to Rule 67(D).  He made the application.  The matter was litigated before you, and my submission to his request to have the evidence excluded, Your Honours, was this was not the remedy.  The remedy was to allow him for reasonable time to conduct what he then termed were necessary further investigations, Your Honour.  Your Honours have ruled and have given Counsel Hooper until Tuesday next week to undertake the cross-examination of this witness.  Now, any other matters arising from service under Rule 67(D), Your Honours, are moot at this point. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, Madam President --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, you will have the floor.  Please try to respond briefly.  Indeed, this issue was brought up yesterday.  We made a ruling yesterday, and yesterday you did not ask for an exclusion of the evidence but for more time.  So we gave more time, up until Tuesday, in fact.  If that is insufficient, you can request supplementary time, or we may envisage calling this witness again, giving you time to do the investigations you need to do. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, Madam President, I appreciate the position and I know this Chamber is anxious to do what is right and just, balancing the interests of the Prosecution against those of the Accused.  Now, in fact, until just now, as I understand it, neither you, Madam President, nor your colleagues, had the document, and that puts matters in a very different situation, because essentially you would have perhaps regarded matters perhaps in a very different light.  I assumed you had the document when I addressed you.  And this is an important matter and it's a matter that I can take quite briefly, in fact, and I hope to do so. 

I see Ms. Makwaia is on her feet. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Unless counsel is asking you to make a review of your own decision, Your Honours, I don't see how we can proceed.  You've made a ruling, and can we please proceed by hearing the evidence of this witness? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That is what we were saying earlier.  We now also have the document, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I'm making an application today.  Whether I made it before or not, perhaps is neither here nor there.  I'm making the application today to have this particular portion of evidence, in fact, excluded.  And the basis upon which I do that is as follows:  First of all, this is a wholly new allegation.  And I appreciate you only have the English text, Madam President, and I appreciate that you are francophone, and I don't know if it will assist if I read through that or if you're content with reading paragraphs 10 and 11 yourself.  What I suggest is that in reading those paragraphs --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That won't be necessary, Counsel.  We have the document.  If we were late in coming back, in fact, it was because we were reading the document.  Thank you.  We have the document.  We did indeed make a ruling yesterday.  What you requested was very clear, and we made a ruling on that.  Now you have another application.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We can still examine that issue. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  I'd respectfully ask you to re-examine the issue, and I think you'll be assisted, now that you've read paragraph 10 and 11, to appreciate the extent of this new allegation.  It is a significant and new allegation, relating to a different place, an event never before raised, involving personalities not referred to before.  That's the first matter. 

Secondly, there is no charge, in either the new indictment, nor the old indictment, that relates to this.  You'll recall that the new indictment sailed under, in particular, the florid colours of specificity.  There is no mention of this in either old or new indictment.  It is completely new.  Between now and next week, the Defence are not going to be able to investigate this matter. 

I'd also draw your attention to the obvious fact that, essentially, with the exception of what she heard said to her husband, all of which is new, the rest of her testimony is tertiary hearsay in any event.  The jurisprudence of this Tribunal and the ICTY, as I understand it, is that when, in these circumstances, a new and fresh allegation is brought, unsupported, as it is, by charge, then the Court, in order to ease the difficulties that confront the Defence, can, as you rightly say, Madam President, provide more and adequate time for that to be done -- and sitting Tuesday is not adequate, in my respectful submission -- or can look at the matter and say, "Well, given all the circumstances, is it really fair for an accused to face such a new allegation and charge after six years at such short notice?" and to say to the Prosecutor, "Well, proceed with the witness, but let's not hear any reference to this further distinct and novel allegation, particularly when the Defence haven't a hint of it in any document of charge over the last many years."  And that would be the just position to take.  

Tuesday will not be adequate time for me to investigate this.  It will take me -- well, it won't take me; it will take an investigator quite some time to put me in the position where I can fruitfully cross-examine the witness with this. 

So the fair alternative and the just alternative, in my respectful submission, given the history and development of this charge -- and this is a witness, incidentally, who provided a statement a long time ago, has confirmed her statement since, gave evidence over four or five days in another case, I accept in the case of Kamuhanda but very much caught up with the events in Gikomero -- and the time that's elapsed since then, and opportunities she's had, here and in Rwanda, to suddenly present this new allegation, to arrive on counsel, Defence counsel's, desk two o'clock last Friday, puts us at a distinct and unfair disadvantage. 

Now, the loss to the Prosecution, given they've never charged this, in any event, really, one would submit, is not great at all.  They can proceed.  They've got their charges.  They know what the witness came for.  And also, as I say, when one reflects on the nature of the hearsay element within this evidence, in any event, it isn't, from the Prosecution's point of view, by any means the strongest either. 

So for all those reasons, I submit the proper course is to have the witness give evidence and to, in fact, limit the evidence-in-chief to those matters other than that particular aspect. 

You see, I appreciate that in this further evidence there is also a radical departure in her testimony, inasmuch as she is now saying she met Rwamakuba on a previous occasion or occasions.  I mean, I -- I'd seek to attack that too, but I recognise that that is so intrinsically bound up with her ability to --
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honour  --
MR. HOOPER:
-- identify the defendant, but I don't take the point --
MS. MAKWAIA:
I'm sorry to interrupt again, Your Honour.
MR. HOOPER:
But I don't take the point with respect to that.  Those are my submissions.
MS. MAKWAIA:
But could counsel reserve some of his submissions for the closing arguments?  Your Honour, that would be the appropriate moment to make some of his submissions.
MR. HOOPER:
And my authority, I should add, is Bagosora -- I didn't mention that -- just for completeness' sake. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Here is our proposal.  We are going to bring in the witness.  We will ask Ms. Makwaia -- and I think it's you who will question the witness.  We will first ask you to stick to the statements of the witness that do not deal with the new allegations.  In the meantime, we will make a ruling on Mr. Hooper's instant motion. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, can I make an additional submissions on the issues? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may.  You may respond. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Now, Your Honour, it's our submission that Counsel has submitted to you that hearsay evidence that this witness will, in the most part, in respect of paragraph 10 and 11 of the additional evidence, be giving hearsay evidence.  It is our submission, and it's upheld by case law, such as the Akayesu case, that hearsay evidence is admissible in this jurisdiction.  It's not the admissibility of the evidence that is at issue but the weight that the Court should attach such evidence during its deliberations. 

Now, as to whether or not there are additional evidence that we seek to lead in respect to the Kayanga health centre, as to whether it's charged or not, Your Honours, I would like to direct your attention at this stage to paragraphs 54 and 66.  That's Count 6, crimes against humanity, extermination, and Count 7, war crimes, which will be addressing this kind of evidence in respect of the Accused Rwamakuba. 

And further to that, Your Honours, it is the jurisprudence of this Tribunal that the Prosecutor can amend for the evidence to conform with the indictment.  So it is a possibility that the Prosecutor has, Your Honours, at a later stage, to amend the indictment so that it can conform with the evidence that has been heard. 

Now, further to that, Your Honours, it is our submission that Rule 89(C) allows -- allows the Trial Chamber to receive any evidence and to attach the necessary weight at the end of the case during its deliberation.  It is our submission, therefore, Your Honours, that you can hear this evidence and choose to exclude it at a later stage.  Those are my additional submissions.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  It is for that reason, indeed, that the Chamber asked to bring the witness in.  We believe that it is up to the Chamber to establish what value must be attached to the evidence the Defence considers as hearsay.  That is why we didn't think it useful to stop, and we thought it was useful to bring in the witness at this point. 

 You may ask the witness questions about facts that have already been made aware to the Defence and we said, for the time being, to not put questions to the witness about facts that are contained in the disclosure of -- the recent disclosure of 23rd April, that are subject to the motion. 

So, registry, could you please bring in the witness? 

Is it clear now?  Are the parties clear? 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, I am, Madam President.  And unfortunately another matter has arisen which I need to urgently address you on.  

Madam President, have you had provided to you a document headed "List of names and places for the testimony of Witness GIN," which I received a minute ago? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We did receive that document, Counsel, yes. 
MR. HOOPER:
No sooner do I applaud Ms. Makwaia's diligence in providing me with notice of additional evidence than I look with askance at this document, because you'll see there are 78 names, mainly of people, and some of places, on this document.  

Now, if I look at page 1, that starts up Abatabazi and Amahoro.  It doesn't take me long, I get to 3, and there are then 12 names that I've never met before, that I recall, or seen in any testimony of this witness.  Page 2, there are seven names I've never seen before, and there are places referred to here that have never featured in this witness's testimony.  Page 3, 14 names I've never seen before.  Page 4, about 12 names that have never featured in any evidence.  Page 5, the final page, three names I've never seen before.  I don't know what that added up to, but it must be close to 40 or 50 references that have never appeared in any document, or as far as I know, transcript, relating to this witness.  And you know where that leads me.  What is going on? 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, may I have a brief response to that?  The purpose of serving the parties with such a document, Your Honours, is to facilitate the spelling of names or -- of names that may come out during the testimony of the witness.  That is the sole purpose.  Now, our associate legal officer did a search that was associated with this witness, whether it was her statement of the 3rd of February 1998, whether it was her prior testimony in other cases, here and in Rwanda, and generated this document, Your Honours.  If it's going to be such a matter of concern to Counsel Hooper, and perhaps the others, then the Prosecutor will desist from providing such documentation and we shall be taking the spellings of any names that arise during the witness's oral testimony as they arise, Your Honours.  This is the sole purpose.  I don't see any prejudice that Counsel Hooper can possibly suffer from such a document. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This is a minor problem.  I don't think we need to spend much more time on this.  We've already done so.  It would be a good thing for all parties to think about judicial economy.  We are wasting far too much time. 

Mr. Hooper, very, very, briefly, please, because we want to usher in the witness.
MR. HOOPER:
I'm not objecting to whatever lists, however long, that the Prosecution want to present us with to assist us.  That is not the point.  The question is that these lists normally reflect, in my experience, and doubtless yours, Madam President, the circumference, the geography, of the witness's testimony.  And that's what concerns me.  Now, if, in fact, Ms. Makwaia is saying, "Well, this list has come about because someone has just done a general trawl and come up with every name possible," that's one thing, but if these are indications of the steps in the witness's testimony known to the Prosecutor, not known to me, then, indeed, one needs to be cautious. 

And I'd also finally like to pick up on Ms. Makwaia's remark, if she meant it, that this witness had given previous testimony in cases in Rwanda.  If that is other than her own murder case, in which she was the defendant, then, of course, I'd need to know about it. 

But as I say, my concern is nothing to do with the list of names per se.  That's an aid and a help.  It's what it implies.  Is this the geography of examination-in-chief? 
(Pages 17 to 29 by Mark Porter)


















	1145H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, just a moment ago you spoke about the list, that is all.  Now, you are moving into other matters but we still don't have the witness in the courtroom.  You will have time to speak about all this.  If there are names which are a problem to you, you can say that in a moment, but please wait until we begin the examination-in-chief of this witness.  

We are -- the Chamber asked that all names which may be mentioned here be written down so that we do not have any problems with spellings of those names.  We are the ones who made that request.  So the Prosecutor is only responding to the demands of the Chamber.  

So please usher in the witness and let us try and move on a bit before it will be 1300H.
(Witness entered courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, good morning once again.  We thank you for being present here with us.  We are going to have you make your solemn declaration before you answer questions which will be put to you by the Prosecution counsel.  Later on you will be cross-examined by counsel for the Defence.  We will now proceed to your solemn declaration.  

Could you please open the curtains, draw back the curtains, because we are in a public and open session?  
MR. RAMADHANI:
Madam Witness, could you please stand up, raise your right and repeat the following words after me?
	(Declaration made by Witness GIN in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Witness.  

Ms. Makwaia, your witness. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Thank you, Madam President.
WITNESS GIN,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Witness GIN, I am going to hand out a document to you with the Chamber's permission, which contains your particulars for your identification.  Please do not read out loudly any of the information contained therein.  I would like to direct your attention particularly to the lower part of the document.  Can you see your name in it?  Is that your name, Madam Witness? 
A.	Yes, that is my name.
Q.	Can you please read through and confirm to us if what's reflected in this document is, in fact, accurate?
A.	How can I read the document whereas I have asked to testify in Kinyarwanda before this Chamber?  I would like the document to be read to me, that it be verified for me, because I have requested that I speak in Kinyarwanda before the Chamber. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you can express yourself in Kinyarwanda.  Do you not understand what is on the document which is in front of you?  If not, we can have an interpreter who can help you in Kinyarwanda. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  Very well, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, could we have an interpreter from the Kinyarwanda booth to come by the witness to help her out?  Thank you.  

Interpreter, can you explain to the witness what is written on that page?  Apparently, these are the details -- the personal details of the witness.  Kindly make sure you do not speak the names out loud.  You can whisper them to the witness.  

Very well, thank you.  So there is only one amendment to be made, is there?  Can that amendment be made?  Can she sign the document?  Can the witness sign the document against the amendment and also for her to sign the bottom of the document, as is usual?  

Very well.  We thank the interpreter.  I do not think that we shall no longer need the interpreter next to the witness.  

Thank you very much, Mr. Interpreter.  
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, I would like to tender the particulars of the witness as Prosecution Exhibit P. 21, under seal, with your permission. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Where is the document, please?  Where is the document, please?  

No objection from the Defence?  

Very well.  So the document bearing the identification details of Witness GIN is admitted as Prosecution Exhibit under reference P. 21, and this document shall be placed under seal. 
	(Exhibit No. P. 21 admitted, under seal)
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Witness GIN, where were you living in April 1994? 
A.	I was living in Gikomero.
Q.	And were you still living in Gikomero on the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, did you hear about the president's plane crashing? 
A.	Yes, I heard that news.
Q.	Can you briefly tell Their Honours what happened in your commune in Gikomero on the subsequent days that followed, just briefly? 
A.	Do you mean the day the aircraft crashed or the days following that aircraft crash, after the death of the president?
Q.	Okay, I will rephrase that.  Did you remain at home after hearing of the president's plane crashing? 
A.	Yes, I stayed at home, but from time to time, I would flee and come back to my house. 
Q.	Why were you fleeing? 
A.	I was afraid for my life. 
Q.	Why were you afraid for your life? 
A.	Because in the neighbourhood abnormal things were taking place. 
Q.	What type of abnormal things? 
A.	People had begun to burn down houses belonging to Tutsis. 
Q.	Do you know who these people were who were burning down the houses of Tutsis? 
A.	Yes, I knew them. 
Q.	Who were they?  Just a few names, you don't have to give many names, and spell them please, if you can.
A.	They were Hutus, Interahamwe.  There are some names such as Ngirusanga.  There was Ngarambe, Gatarama, Mivumbi, Gihanga and many others. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, for the record, Ngirusanga is found at No. 62.  Ngarambe is found at No. 61.  
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	And, Witness, can you spell Mivumbi for president record, please? 
A.	Mivumbi is spelt M --
Q.	Yes. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Can the Kinyarwanda interpreters please assist on that spelling, Your Honours, if the witness is incapable? 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Mivumbi is spelt M-I-V-U-M-B-I, Mivumbi.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Now, Witness, do you know a person of the name André Rwamakuba? 
A.	Yes, I know him.
Q.	How do you know him? 
A.	I know him as a Rwandan, and as a Rwandan they did badly during the genocide. 
Q.	Now, you said that you know him as a Rwandan and a Rwandan who did badly during the genocide.  Did you see him during the genocide? 
A.	Yes, I saw him. 
Q.	Can you start by telling Your Honours when you saw him, that is, which month, and can you give an approximate date when you saw him? 
A.	I saw him in Gikomero, at a location called Kurupangu; that was in the month of April.  That was in 1994.  I do not remember the time of the day because it's been a very long time.  I am just giving you an approximation because it's been a very long time.  But I do remember that it was between the 14th and the 20th when he came to Gikomero.  That was my first time I saw him.  That was the first time I saw him since the war erupted. 
Q.	All right.  Madam Witness, we will come back to the other times you saw him, but shall we just stick to this particular incident when you saw him during the genocide first.  When you saw him, what was he doing? 
A.	He was at a location called Kurupangu.  He was giving instructions out about the manner in which the Tutsis were going to be killed.
MR. HOOPER:
May we have the spelling, please, for the last two names? 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Yes, please, if the interpreters could spell Kurupangu for the record, Your Honour.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Kurupangu is spelt, K-U-R-U-P-A-N-G-U.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Before the interruption, Madam GIN, you had told the Court that he was giving instructions.
A.	Yes, that was what I was saying. 
Q.	To whom was he giving instructions?  Can you describe this event to the Court, please? 
A.	He was giving orders to the Interahamwe, for the latter to go out and kill Tutsis and, of course, also Hutu that were opposing the government in place at the time.  He also talked with the policemen and the Interahamwe who were there.
Q.	How do you know about this?  Were you present when he was giving these instructions? 
A.	Yes, madam, I was there.  I was just about ten metres away from him, and all that he said, I heard. 
Q.	Do you know if the instruction he gave to the Interahamwe and other Hutu was carried out? 
A.	Yes, indeed. 
Q.	How was this carried out? 
A.	The people who were supposed to be killed, indicated by him, were killed.  They immediately carried out the instructions as soon as they received the instructions.  They immediately carried them out. 
Q.	You have also made reference to Interahamwe.  What is an Interahamwe? 
A.	Those were Hutu that the government trained to kill Tutsi. 
Q.	Now, after Rwamakuba gave these instructions and they were carried out, what happened to you? 
A.	Could you rephrase your question a little bit more clear?  I did not understand the question as such. 
Q.	All right.  After this incident, did you see Rwamakuba again? 
A.	Yes, I saw him again. 
Q.	When? 
A.	I saw him again in the following days.  Just after that incident, I saw him again. 
Q.	What was he doing this time when you saw him? 
A.	He came to Kurupangu, he went to Kayanga.  And when he came to Kurupangu, he briefly greeted the people in the area. 
Q.	I am sorry, it is my mistake.  I should have advised you, you cannot testify yet as that incident or events that took place at the Kayanga health centre, so we won't go into that evidence at this stage.  Their Honours have to make a ruling on that.  Is that understood? 
A.	Very well. 
Q.	Coming back to the first incident that you refer to as taking place at Kurupangu, would that be the trade centre or in Gikomero? 
A.	Yes, madam, that is the same location. 
Q.	Now, can you describe in fuller detail exactly what happened from the moment Rwamakuba arrived at this area until the instructions were given out and the individuals were -- and the instructions were given out and carried out?  Can you please describe this event in fuller detail, please? 
A.	When he arrived at the date I indicated, that was between the 14th and the 20th -- when he arrived at Kurupangu, he went on up to the sectoral office where he found the bourgmestre, that is Rutaganira, and the accountant, Mathias Rubanguka; there was also Nyarwaya who was the guard there from the commune, and there were many other people.  There were several soldiers, policemen and civilians.  There were also some Interahamwe.  I don't know what they talked about.  He came back to Kurupangu ***********. 
MR. HOOPER:
I barely could barely get any of that.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please.

MR. HOOPER:
I barely have been able to get any of that as a note.  I need to make a note.  I don't want to slow up the witness's testimony unnecessarily, but I need to keep a full note. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, please.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone please. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, did you follow what you are being requested to do, because we were not able to hear the beginning of your sentence translated?
MR. HOOPER:
The witness went into a paragraph of evidence and I was just trying to ensure, before she went too much further, that it could be broken up.  My note at the moment reads:  "When he arrived there between the date I gave, between the 14th and the 20th, he went to the --" and that was as far as I was able to keep up.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Could witness be requested, when she says a name, to pause a little so we can spot the name on the list or probably spell it out as well? 
MS. MAKWAIA:
I think, Your Honours, maybe if immediately the Kinyarwanda interpreters could just spell it out, that would expedite matters as opposed to looking it up in the list and stopping the evidence. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you follow what the interpreter is trying to say?  The witness also should pause, because if she continues to talk while the interpreter is trying to spell the name, that would be some jarring problems.  Probably the witness could speak a little bit slower. 
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Madam Witness, when you utter names, can you please take a pause so that we get the spelling of the name on the record, and can you please speak much slower than you are doing at the moment?

You were describing to the Court Rwamakuba's arrival at Kurupangu or the trade centre in Gikomero and the incident that took place upon his arrival.  Can you please go on? 
A.	Do you want me to recommence to narrate what happened or should I proceed from the point I left off?  Shall I start again or shall I just proceed?  Do you want me to continue?  Do you want me to proceed from where I left or shall I start again, Prosecutor?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You can start your last sentence again and then you proceed from there. 

THE WITNESS:
Now, I was saying that when he came back, he came back accompanied by authorities.  He came from Kurupangu with those authorities that I mentioned. 
 MR. HOOPER:
I am not trying to interrupt. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please.
MR. HOOPER:
But I don't know where he is coming back from, and I didn't get the names of the people.  It is your witness; can you just please ensure that it is done at a pace that we can note, please? 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, we all have the opportunity of the transcripts.  If Mr. Hooper ceases interrupting the witness -- witness at every opportunity, then she loses her trend of thought.  I am going to recommence this sequence for once and for all, with your permission, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now, we should be able to understand what is being said.  It is important that when witness pronounces a name that we do not know, whether it is a location or an individual, the witness should pause and the name should be spelt out.  That is what we are seeking to secure so that we wouldn't have any problems with the names of locations or individuals.  Very well. 
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Witness GIN, you said Rwamakuba arrived at Kurupangu or the trade centre at Gikomero.  Can you please tell the Court who he arrived with, and as you state the names, take a pause so that we can have the spelling on the record by the interpreters? 
A.	Very well.  When Rwamakuba came from Kigali, he arrived, he went to the Gikomero sectoral office.  He found bourgmestre Rutaganira there, that is at the sectoral office.  Rutaganira is spelt 
R-U-T-A-G-A-N-I-R-A. 
Q.	Yes, can you go on? 
A.	Now, he also found Mathias, that is the accountant there, Rubanguka.  Rubanguka is spelt 
R-U-B-A-N-G-U-K-A, Rubanguka, Mathias; that is the accountant. 
Q.	Can you please go on? 
A.	There was also the Brigadier Nyarwaya from the Gikomero commune.  N-Y-A-R-W-A-Y-A, Nyarwaya, that is Brigadier Nyarwaya.  There was Kayibanda.  Kayibanda is spelt K-A-Y-I-B-A-N-D-A, Kayibanda.  There was also Ngarambe, spelt N-G-A-R-A-M-B-E, Ngarambe.  The latter two individuals were communal policemen. There was an Interahamwe called Gihanga, spelt 
G-I-H-A-N-G-A, an Interahamwe called Gihanga, and Ngiruwosanga was there as well, spelt 
N-G-I-R-U-W-O-S-A-N-G-A, Ngiruwosanga, and many other persons.  I couldn't tell you what they were talking about.  When they met there at the sectoral office, I don't know what they were talking about.
Q.	Did they subsequently leave the sectoral office, Madam Witness?
A.	Yes, madam, they left.  They left the sectoral office. 
Q.	Where did they go, do you know? 
A.	They came back to the trade centre at Kurupangu.
Q.	And were you able to see them at Kurupangu trade centre when they came? 
A.	Yes, I was able to see them. 
Q.	Now, can you tell the Court what happened when they came to the trade centre? 
A.	Yes, two young fellows came.  They were at Karekezi's.  Now those two chaps were running away.  And all those people who were at Karekezi's -- 
Q.	(Overlapping microphones)...so that we can take the spelling of Karekezi.
A.	It is spelt K-A-R-E-K-E-Z-I, Karekezi. 
Q.	You were telling the Court that two young chaps were running away.  Can you please go on with your narrative? 
A.	Those young fellows came and all the people that were there stopped them.  They asked for their identity cards, and the young fellows did not have identity cards but they showed their diplomas.  I did not understand or see the diplomas clearly or see the pieces of paper they handed over, but later on I understood that they were diplomas, so that they handed their diplomas to Rwamakuba and he immediately tore them.  He tore them.  He said that was a trick for these people not to surrender their identity cards because they were Tutsi.  He said it was a trick.  He therefore concluded that those chaps were Tutsi because nobody else was running way apart from the Tutsi.  It was only the Tutsi that were running way, and it was at that time that he instructed the Interahamwe to kill them.  But he told them not to kill them at the centre.  So they had to go lower down in the bushes below.  That is just next to the Kurupangu.  So they killed these young people, and when they came back, there were no longer in the company of those young people that they killed.  They came back to Karekezi's and it was thus that they came, and then they went a little bit further.  Now, when he was standing there talking --
Q.	Now, when Rwamakuba was tearing up the certificates, where were you?
A.	Well, I was ***********************************, in front of -- in the street and opposite me, there was Rwamakuba. 
Q.	Can you give Their Honours an estimate of the distance separating you and Rwamakuba?  And you can use this courtroom as a point of reference, if you wish.
A.	Ten metres, I would say, of a distance.  If I estimate it, I will put it at a distance between where I am right here and the interpreter's booth, about ten metres, I would put it.
Q.	Now, could you hear what Rwamakuba was saying? 
A.	I could. 
Q.	You have also testified that he ordered these chaps killed but they were taken further down to bushes.  Were they killed, do you know? 
A.	They were killed. 
Q.	How do you know this? 
A.	They brought them and when I saw them -- when they came back, they were no longer with those young people.  When they brought them away, they were shouting, they were fighting with them.  They were beating each other. 
Q.	When these two young men were being taken to the bush, can you tell the Court who formed the group of people who took them to the bushes? 
A.	Yes, Ngirusanga, Kayibanda, Ngarambe, Mivumbi, Gihanga, Ngiruwosanga.  I don't know if you want me to continue with the list. 
Q.	That would be sufficient.  Was Rwamakuba still present when the two young men were being taken to the bushes? 
A.	Yes, he was there.  They left together when they took the young people away. 
Q.	Now, once -- the group that took these two young people to the bushes to be killed, were they armed in any manner? 
A.	Yes, they had various weapons.
Q.	Can you describe to the Court some of the weapons they had? 
A.	The communal police officers had guns.  The people -- well, some of them had clubs, some with nails inside; others had hatchets; others had machetes. 
Q.	From where you were located to the bushes where these young men were taken, do you know what the distance is? 
A.	Well, approximately, between 50 to 70 metres I would say, approximately 50 to 70 metres. 
Q.	Can you give an approximation of how long the entire incident lasted from the arrival of Rwamakuba at the trade centre until the taking of the two young chaps to the bushes and the return of Rwamakuba and his group back to the trade centre? 
A.	It took between 30 minutes to one hour. 
Q.	Did you ever find out what the ethnic group of the two young men was? 
A.	Since they were fleeing and since I didn't know who they were, I can only presume, given the circumstances and given the fact that the people who refused to produce their identity cards were Tutsis, I presumed that they were Tutsis, based on that.
Q.	After Rwamakuba and his group returned from the bushes, did you see him again on this day? 
A.	I saw him again, yes.
Q.	Where did you see him? 
A.	At the same Gikomero centre. 
Q.	And what was he doing this time? 
A.	He was talking with people.  The ones who went up with him after killing those people, they were standing, standing in the square.  Later another young man arrived; he was aboard a motorbike. 
Q.	Do you know where he was coming from, this young man on a motorbike?
A.	He said that he was coming from Rutongo, R-U-T-O-N-G-O, Rutongo.
Q.	So what happened to this young man? 
A.	He was caught, he was asked to produce his identity card, and he was not in a position to do so.  He told them that he was coming from Rutongo and he was fleeing.  They said, "What are you fleeing?"  He answered, and there were orders given to kill them and that was done.  His motorbike was taken and the brigadier from Gikomero kept his motorbike.
Q.	Now, can you stop there for a moment?  When the young man arriving from Rutongo arrived at the centre, was Rwamakuba still there? 
A.	Yes, he was still there.
Q.	And now, you said there were orders given to kill this young man.  Who gave the orders? 
A.	It was Rwamakuba. 
Q.	And where were you at this point in time when Rwamakuba gave this order? 
A.	I was **************************. 
Q.	Did you hear Rwamakuba give the order himself or did somebody else tell you about this? 
A.	Rwamakuba was not afraid to speak out loud.  You know, during -- rather, in the countryside when authorities arrive, many people gather around and so he had to raise his voice to speak so they could hear.  My husband was present.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And the witness has just given the name of her husband and interpreter is not sure whether or not to mention that name since this is a protected witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Indeed, Mr. Interpreter, do not mention the name. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness says even her husband was amongst the persons in the crowd. 
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Do you recall the words that Rwamakuba said? 
A.	Yes, not word-for-word, but I know the gist of what he said. 
Q.	Can you please tell the Court? 
A.	He said the following: "Unite, fight the enemy.  The enemy is going to exterminate you.  As such, kill all of the Tutsis and all the opponents of the government.  Don't let those people lie to you, telling you they are Hutu.  The only persons fleeing are Tutsis; you have to kill them."
Q.	Now, ultimately, after Rwamakuba's orders, what happened to this man who fled from Rutongo?  Can you tell Their Honours, please? 
A.	He was taken.  He was searched.  The identity card he did not want to show was found and on that card, there was an indication of Tutsi ethnicity.  His shirt was taken by Ngiruwosanga.  He was taken down and killed.  He was even buried before he actually died. 
Q.	Do you know where he was killed? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Could you please tell us? 
A.	In the same bush. 
Q.	At this point in time when he was taken to be killed at the bushes, was Rwamakuba still present? 
A.	He was still there, yes. 
Q.	Did you see the killers return from the bushes? 
A.	Yes, I saw them. 
Q.	Were they armed? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Were they armed with the same type of weapons that you have described earlier to the Court? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Madam Witness, you are a Tutsi, aren't you? 
A.	I am. 
Q.	Were you not scared for your life in observing all these incidents at this point in time? 
A.	I was afraid.  I had a glimmer of hope to survive since my husband, who was armed, was protecting me; that gave me a glimmer of hope to survive. 
Q.	Now, did Rwamakuba remain at the trade centre after the second time you saw him on that day? 
A.	No, he spent a few more moments discussing matters with the local authorities and thereafter he left. 
Q.	Can you estimate the time of day that he left the trade centre on this day?  Are you in a position to tell Their Honours?
A.	With respect to his arrival time, and since I have already said that everything he did lasted about one hour to one and half hours, if you add 15 to 30 minutes, the time during which that conversation took place, I would say that he remained there about one hour to two hours of time he spent at the centre. 
Q.	Do you know during which part of the day it was?  Was it during the morning or during the afternoon, can you tell us, please? 
A.	Well, you must realise that it has been ten years.  I will try to give you estimation but I can't be absolutely certain of what I am saying.  It must have been between ten o'clock in the morning and 
1 p.m.
MS. MAKWAIA:
At this stage, Your Honours, I would like the witness to be shown Prosecution Exhibit 3, photograph No. 12.  And I would just like to indicate to Your Honours, given your pending ruling, I have got very few questions that I would like to put to the witness in a closed session after projecting this photograph. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Madam Prosecutor. 

MS. MAKWAIA:
In fact, Your Honours, with your indulgence, I would like the witness to approach the monitor so she can indicate as she gives her evidence at this point. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, can you please approach the projector? 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Can the photograph be focused, please, Your Honours?  It is out of focus. 

Can you blow it up, please, and make it sharper?  Okay, that is much better.   
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Witness, do you recognise this photograph? 
A.	I do.  I do recognise it.  I can recognise the places on this photo.
Q.	Okay.  Starting with the building on the right, what is that?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Is it the building the witness is pointing to, this one?
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Let me rephrase that, Madam Witness.  Could you please point out to me any of the buildings you recognise and tell me whose properties they are? 
A.	*******************.  This one belongs to Karekezi.  The following one, and you don't see it clearly here, belongs to a certain Vincent, and then the last one, Marietta.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, can the record reflect the witness has identified *************************** the photograph, the far right house, and then she has pointed out the second house that follows it as being Karekezi's house, and then another building further to that and as Marietta's house.
THE WITNESS:
No, the third one is Vincent's, not the following one.  The third house is Vincent's.
MS. MAKWAIA:
I am being corrected, Your Honours. The witness has corrected me and stated that the third house is the house of Vincent's and not Marietta.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Now, Madam Witness, using this photograph, can you indicate to Their Honours where you were when you saw Rwamakuba arrive from the Gikomero sectoral office on that day? 
A.	Rwamakuba came up from here, that is where the secteur office is, and then he came to Karekezi's.  I told you that **************************************************************. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness pointed exactly where she was with the pen. 

MS. MAKWAIA:
I think, Your Honours, for the purpose of the clarity of the record, I am going to hand out to the witness a separate photograph from the one exhibit, exhibited in P. 3, but it is the same photograph, so she can actually make markings on that photograph, and then I will enter that photograph on the record, if that's agreeable with Your Honours. 
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Madam Witness, would you put a cross on your house? 
A.	You can't see the ink from this pen when I mark the photograph.
Q.	Can you mark higher up on the building please, because where you marked we can't really see.  I am handing out to you a yellow pen.  Okay, that is better.  Now -- and I will stick with the black pen, I think that is a better option. 

Now, can you indicate to the Court where you were standing when you saw Rwamakuba?  Can you mark that place, put an 'R' on that place.  Okay.  

Mr. Weyl is on his feet, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl.
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, this is so difficult.  There are so many objections with issues when the witness asks -- when the Defence asks questions that may reveal the identity of the witness.  Here we are dealing with a photo with the witness, and there is a double standard.  Everything in this exercise identifies this witness. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, one option is to seal this part of the evidence or to go immediately into closed session and proceed.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That is what I was about to say to Mr. Weyl.  We have documents that may be placed under seal, that is different. 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, I told -- proof of the contrary, we are still in open session.  I am not asking for a closed session.  I just wanted to point out the problem.   There is a parity of protection of witnesses.  When the Prosecutor objects to questions by the Defence that may reveal the identity of the witness, we have to be equal in the approach.  This is not a very useful exercise, otherwise. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think, indeed, we must be prudent.  The public is following everything here.  Indeed, we are in open session.  There is indeed a problem.  This witness has indicated on the document *************
          located.  There are perhaps people in the gallery who are following the debate. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, in that case, I move immediately into closed session.  In that case, I move immediately for a closed session so that we can proceed with the evidence, and all the identifying information that was revealed during the public session should be placed under seal, with your permission, 
Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Any objection to the closed session?  

I see the witness raising her hand.  Has she something to say, perhaps?
THE WITNESS:
Please, don't be too worried about the fact that I have indicated *****************************************
          ****************.  Other people have perhaps done the same exercise before me.  Don't worry.  You don't need to take any specific measures. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we understand you, but still people can say *************************************it can be figured out who you are, and so it is more prudent to go into a closed session as requested by the Prosecution.  
MR. WEYL:
I will deduce exactly what the witness has just said.  She says that she hasn't asked for any protection.  Perhaps, she is asking for protection against her own will.  I understood that protection was only given when it is only requested by the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution? 
MS. MAKWAIA:
I object to Counsel Weyl's conclusion, Your Honour.  This witness is appearing here as a protected witness.  Even though *****************************************, as indicated correctly by Your Honours, others may deduce her identity through that omission.  So I would rather proceed with caution, 
Your Honours, and I remain in closed session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objections from the Defence as regards the closed session?  I think you yourselves believe that it is necessary to go into closed session.
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, with your leave.  I don't believe anything.  I only wanted to point out -- I would like us to clear the air here.  We are dealing with a protected witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, we are not here to deal with the issue of protected witnesses.  We are here for the testimony of this witness, and we are dealing specifically with this witness.  We are not here to analyse the issue of witness protection in general.  So I ask you, Mr. Weyl, to answer the Chamber's question, if there are any objections to a closed session.  We are ordering a closed session. 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, with your leave, I oppose the closed session in the sense that the witness has already said she doesn't see the grounds for such a closed session.  There is no reason to go into closed session.  And to order a closed session when the witness has not asked for a closed session, she's just said that there is no need for such a closed session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We believe that it is necessary to protect the witness.  Even if the witness has said******************
          *****************, she did not say that she is opposed to a closed session.  We ordered therefore a closed session at this time.  As we have said, this is for the protection of the witness and it is in the interest of justice.
