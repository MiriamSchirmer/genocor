P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody.  

Madam Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MS. KOUO:  
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short, and Judge Gustave Kam (sic) is now sitting in open session, today, Thursday, 6th July 2006, for the continuation in the trial of the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, case number ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Madam Registrar.  The appearances are the same.  

Mr. Robinson, I gathered you wanted to -- 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, I do, Mr. President.  Thank you very much.  

Mr. President, as you know, I did the best I could yesterday on my cross-examination, based on the information that I had received in the statement of Witness XBM.  And included in that statement, as you know, was the new allegation that on the 14th of April 1994 he had seen Mr. Nzirorera at the Tam Tam bar in Gisenyi in the presence of Anatole Nsengiyumva, and had overheard their conversation.  

When I left Court yesterday, I received disclosure under Rule 68 from the Prosecution of approximately 260 -- 206 pages of material, consisting of statement and testimony given by one of the people who Witness XBM claimed was with him during the time that that meeting occurred.  And I was in my office last night reviewing that material until after 10 p.m.  In fact, I was too tired to even watch the football match.  

And my review of that material reveals that that witness testified that he had never seen Anatole Nsengiyumva before a day at the end of May 1994 when he encountered him in Gisenyi in a place called Busasamana.  So, it's clear that the testimony of that witness contradicts the testimony of Witness XBM.  

Secondly, the Prosecution provided an excerpt from a mission report that its investigators had done immediately after meeting Witness XBM on the 6th of September 2005, when they received the allegation about this meeting at the Tam Tam bar.  On the next day they contacted another person who Witness XBM said was present by the name of Pascal Ntawumenyumunsi -- that's spelt N-T-A-W-U-M-E-N-Y-U-M-U-N-S-I.  And Mr. Ntawumenyumunsi had informed -- had been informed of what XBM had said, and his reply was that he was not even in Gisenyi during this time.  So, the two witnesses who have been -- whose information has been provided to us about this meeting directly contradict Witness XBM's account of it.  

So, I thought that I was finished with my Rule 68 material, but when I arrived this morning in my office, a little after 8, I had seen that there had been yet another Rule 68 disclosure, that being the judgment in the case of Banzi Wellars in Gisenyi, in the Rwandan courts.  And you may recall that Witness XBM said that he had seen a videotape in connection with that case of the meetings, including the one -- I can't actually say he was clear on this, but impliedly the meeting at Umuganda stadium he claims to have attended on the 27th of October 1993.  It's a 67-page judgment.  

I started reading it; I'm on page 32 right now.  And I simply have not had the time to complete the review of that Rule 68 material.  I also haven't had the time to discuss any of this with my client.  So, I'm asking for additional time to complete review of this Rule 68 material before asking additional questions of Witness XBM.  

Secondly, I am making a request for other Rule 68 material, which I believe is in the possession of the Prosecution, which has not yet been disclosed.  Specifically, I am informed that Witness DAS has given statements to the Prosecution and testified in the trial of Colonel Nsengiyumva to the effect that Colonel Nsengiyumva was in Kigali on the 14th of April, the date that Witness XBM says he was with Mr. Nzirorera at the Tam Tam bar.  

Secondly (sic), Witness DBN, who I'm also informed gave statements to the Prosecution and testified in the trial of Colonel Nsengiyumva to the effect that Colonel Nsengiyumva was in Kigali on the 15th of April, which is an alternative date that appears in the statement of Witness XBM for that meeting at the Tam Tam bar.  

And so I would ask the Prosecution to provide that Rule 68 material to me so that I can review it and, if necessary, put questions to Witness XBM based upon that.  Thank you very much.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, as for the Rule 68 disclosures, all of those materials were sent to the Defence from right here in the courtroom as we were conducting the proceedings yesterday.  I was going through emails, and so on and so forth, so it's a mystery to me why Mr. Robinson only received one part of it this morning.  But be that as it may, we will simply rely on his representations.  But I recall sending that material yesterday, early afternoon.  

All of these matters to me seem extraneous to this trial and to the testimony of this witness.  If the Prosecutor had been in possession of this statement when the witness was giving his direct testimony, we would have tried to elicit testimony about this incident on the 14th or the 15th of April, the Defence would have objected, and I believe this Court would have upheld his objection, that that material could not be elicited by the Prosecution because it had not been pleaded in the indictment or in the pre-trial brief.  This is the same type of objection that is -- is pending before this Trial Chamber in relation to other aspects of XBM's testimony.  

But there are differences, and the two -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Could the Prosecutor please be requested to slow down somewhat, thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Let me begin again.  

Had the Prosecution team been aware of this statement of the 5th -- excuse me, the 6th of September 2005, and had we relied on it to try to elicit evidence of this incident that took place on the 14th or the 15th of April, the Defence would have objected and we would have engaged in motion practice over whether that incident could be elicited from the witness.  It's not pleaded in the indictment; it's not going to be a part of this case.  

Mr. Robinson elicited that aspect of the witness' evidence only to use it to refute his credibility.  So, he brought it out to impeach the witness' testimony, and now he is suggesting to this Court that he needs more time for further investigation so he could further impeach what is -- has already been elicited only for purposes of impeachment.  My submission is that this is a clear waste of this Trial Chamber's time, and the resources of this Tribunal.  To me it's inconceivable that the Defence should be allowed to elicit information -- only to elicit information that was not brought out on direct, simply to impeach the witness, and then to allege that there is yet other information to impeach the impeaching information.  So we're going in circles here.  

I'm not suggesting that confronting the witness about the inconsistencies in his account of this incident are (sic) not appropriate.  They are appropriate.  Mr. Robinson can ask him questions about it.  He's done that already; if he wants to ask a few more questions, there's no problem with that.  But to suggest that additional time and additional investigation is required in order to complete this aspect of his cross-examination is a bit far fetched.  And I would urge this Court to deny the request so that we can move on with this witness' testimony and with the other aspects of this trial.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, looking at this matter in a -- all aspects of it, if we were minded to grant the time, would the Prosecutor complete their re-examination now?  And if necessary -- if necessary, we could consider an application to bring the witness back at a later stage.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I feel at a bit of a loss, because we are -- this has become a protracted matter when it could be resolved quite simply -- well, let me rephrase.  

If you would give me a moment, I would like to raise the issue with my associate, and then we will come back to the Court.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, we don't feel it's appropriate to start our redirect examination of this witness until the Defence have completed their cross-examination.  And if the Court is minded to bring the witness back and to interrupt the cross-examination, and to give the Defence more time to prepare for their cross-examination, we should simply wait for the Defence to complete their portion of the examination and we will redirect afterwards.  

I return to my original submission, Your Honour, that the incident on the 14th and 15th of April was brought in only to impeach the witness --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Would counsel please keep a measured pace.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
My understanding of how the Court explained how they would apply the law is that that type of information would not be considered evidence-in-chief, it would only be considered for purposes of impeachment.  So, if we already have on the record this information from the statement of the 6th of September 2005, only for purposes of impeachment, what would be the point of allowing further investigation to impeach now this account from 2005?  To me it seems to be a bit redundant, and it's simply not a wise expenditure of all of our resources.  If the only issue is impeachment of this witness' in-court testimony, that has been achieved by bringing out the inconsistency between the written statement and what the witness stated during his direct examination.  To now pursue that any further doesn't make any sense to me. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, I don't think you have really understood what I asked you.  We have now -- you see, as far as I understand, counsel has not said that he intends to re- or cross-examine further.  As far as I understand, he said he wanted time to consider whether to do that.  That's how I understand -- I will clarify that in a minute.  But that's where I understand we are.  

I want to complete this witness' testimony, as far as it is possible to do so, now.  And the question really was -- had to do with scheduling issues.  I personally think it would be better to complete the witness' testimony now, and if counsel wanted to make an application to cross-examine him further, we will consider it.  And I am going to discuss that with him to make certain that I understand precisely where he's coming from.  

But, you see, it seemed to me to be better to complete this witness insofar as we could right now, and then move on to the next witness if possible.  That was really where I was thinking at the moment.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay.  Could the Court kindly clarify the matter with the Defence and then we will come back.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President.  Well, to answer your question, I think you've stated it correctly.  I think the chances of my wanting to put further questions to this witness are very high, but I am not in a position to be able to make an application because I haven't finished reviewing all the Rule 68 material.  But I am in agreement with the Prosecution that they should do their redirect examination afterwards, because I'm sensing that it's going to be very difficult to convince you to bring back this witness, and I have -- you've adopted the solution for every witness that has come to this trial so far, that, okay, we can bring him back if necessary.  But I don't hold a lot of hope for that, and I know that the jurisprudence makes it a very high burden to bring a witness back.  So, I prefer that we -- that the Prosecution reserve its redirect examination so I have a better chance of actually seeing this witness again.  And that's the way I would like to do it.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But when is it -- you said you're on page 32.  You're talking about a half an hour?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I'm talking about a half an hour to maybe read the material, and half an hour to an hour to discuss it all with Mr. Nzirorera.  But I would prefer, really, to do this cross-examination after I've also had a chance to investigate the material.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, we are not going to interrupt the examination of this witness for that sort of time.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
That's just --
 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I mean, that's just not a practical approach, as far as I am concerned.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, the problem is that you're putting me in a position where you're expecting me to cross-examine a witness based on very, very incomplete information, received at the very last minute, and that's not fair to my client.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That is not what I had proposed.  You said you preferred to complete your cross-examination now, and I asked you how much time you need to prepare.  You have suggested that you need an hour to do what you can do in court, apart from launching further investigations in Rwanda.  Now, I don't think that the launching of further investigations in Rwanda is an activity which should be dealt with now.  If you do launch further investigations and they produce material which requires further examination, then we will deal with that at that stage. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
But I prefer to postpone my entire cross-examination until a later time in the next session, and that the Prosecutor do his redirect examination in the next session, instead of putting questions to the witness on the basis of scattered information that I'm trying to assimilate in a very short time.  I would like to have the opportunity to read and consider the information, check it out, and then do a proper cross-examination.  

This is no way to try an important case, to be receiving material, having to read it, digest it, come to court the next day, question the witness about it, and then go back and try to figure out if what I've read is correct, or find out from the field that there's different information.  This is a very poor way of proceeding.  I feel -- I feel less than competent in my -- in doing this job this way.  I really feel very uncomfortable, being constantly put in a position to cross-examine without being adequately prepared.  And it's to the detriment of my client.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, there's another way of addressing this issue.  This incident, or the evidence of this incident at the Tam Tam bar, which, if believed, could be incriminating, ought not to be part of the case.  I mean, if we -- if the Prosecutor had attempted to adduce this evidence, and you had opposed its introduction, we would most likely have excluded it from the trial process.  

Now, in view of the lateness of the disclosure to you and the short time that you had to consider it, we are wondering whether it might not be more appropriate for you, at this stage, to have that element of the testimony excluded.  We would be disposed to grant an application of that nature if made.  And that may be a satisfactory way of addressing this new material.
  
MR. ROBINSON: 
That's something I would like to consider.  To me I was thinking that this was evidence of a false -- the witness' false allegation. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We understand -- we understand the argument you initially raised.  We just wondered if more time would produce a different approach.  But we have mentioned that as another way of -- in which this matter could be approached.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, I would like to consider that and discuss that with my client.  That's a possibility, but my first inclination was to think that we would benefit from proving to the Trial Chamber that this witness has made false accusations against Mr. Nzirorera, and from the disclosure we received so far from the Prosecutor, it seems likely we will be able to do that.  But I would like to discuss that with my client, because I see the merit, also, in what you are proposing.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  

In relation to the cross-examination on the two matters which you've already raised, the -- you referred to the conflicting information coming from Witness DAS and Witness DBN.  We're not sure if, for the purposes of impeachment, you need to cross-examine the witness further on those issues, because his evidence on those issues is already quite unequivocal on the record.  The impeachment would come from your adducing testimony to show that other witnesses have a different version of the -- or contradictory information.  And it will be up to the Court to determine who we believe.  

So, in terms of addressing those two particular matters that you mentioned, further cross-examination will not be necessary.  We don't know what your investigation of the judgment is going to reveal.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I understand.  And the two witnesses whose Rule 68 material I don't have yet also pertain to impeaching the incident at the Tam Tam bar, so I think that's all sort of one package.  I understand that.  And then the judgment of Banzi Wellars appears to deal with another issue about the meeting at the Umuganda stadium, which was in the indictment, so I still wish to determine whether I should cross-examine based on that.  

And I would have to say again, my inclination is to go ahead with the Tam Tam bar evidence because I think our prospects for using it to show that the witness' false -- is giving false testimony in general, throughout his testimony, is beneficial to us.  But I would like some time to discuss that with my client.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  
Mr. Lahaie, where does this put us with AWB?  How much time -- when -- because that's my real interest, it includes our scheduling of his evidence-in-chief.  
MR. LAHAIE: 
Well, in response to that question, Mr. President, I would say that we had put aside two days for the chief -- examination-in-chief for AWB.  Of course, I don't think that I will require those two days in full.  So, tentatively I would say that one day would be enough.  Of course, the later we begin -- I think we also need to take cross-examination into account, but I think one day will suffice.  

Now, for redirect of XBM at this stage, I don't think it should be too lengthy, but there might be an objection or two for me to raise, so that might make it somewhat lengthier.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about the hearing of AWB.  As I said yesterday afternoon, we will probably be up against a number of difficulties, notably with reference to disclosure.  I would like to call the attention of the Trial Chamber to the fact that in order to lead our cross-examination, we will need to have access to documents that have only been disclosed to us in the Kinyarwanda language.  We have 60 pages of transcript with reference to Rule 68 -- Rule 68 material that have not been disclosed -- and have been disclosed only in Kinyarwanda.  So it's very difficult for us to lead a cross-examination in such conditions, whereas the Rule 66 material has not been disclosed to us in a language that we can use.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, that's an administrative issue, and the Trial Chamber has instituted mechanisms to assist in this matter.  But when you make that request at the very last minute, there's little we can do.  What I would suggest, in any event, is that if you could identify those portions of the -- of the documents that you will be using in your cross-examination, that might be a starting point in getting assistance in getting the relevant translation.  So, if you could do that, and I will -- and discuss that with the trial coordinator, we will see in what way assistance can be provided to you.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, with your leave, I think I should remind the Chamber that we were not to hear AWB, but we were to hear ALG.  So, the documents that I am referring to are documents that were disclosed to us belatedly, very belatedly, because that was in fact a few days before the beginning of the session.  They were disclosed to Paris, received on the 9th of May; we began the session on the 15th of May.  And they should have been considered inadmissible, because we would have had to lead investigations with those documents in our possession within a reasonable time limit before the session.  

So, when you talk about a last-minute request, I am not under the position -- under the impression, excuse me, that I am giving you such a request.  But I think that we need to respect the rules, and I think that the rule should be that material should be disclosed in French and in English.  And we should not have to beg for translations; the translation should have been done.  

These are documents, or material under Rule 66, and I am not in the impression that I am putting a last-minute request to you.  I was expecting disclosures.  They should have come to me 60 days before the beginning of the session, and I am not under the impression that the onus is on me to serve the Prosecutor.  Because it is in fact his obligation, according to the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, and I think he should comply with it.  

Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Prosecutor, do you have the translations available?  
MR. LAHAIE: 
To my knowledge there is no translation available.  Those documents are the ones that we received in the original language, and they have not been translated.  We sent them immediately to the Defence, as soon as we had received them.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, the issue of language is a matter which has been on the table from the beginning of this trial.  What I was saying earlier is that this witness is due to start testifying today, possibly.  And we have indicated that the task of gaining translations is a task which can be achieved in different ways.  We think that there have been administrative and organisational arrangements made to assist in the issue of translations.  We have one translation department which cannot translate everything in a timely fashion.  And what we have been saying is that our Trial Chamber is willing to assist in dealing with language problems when they arise.  

And all I was saying is that -- that we would have expected that you would have drawn a problem of this nature to our attention earlier, which would have given us a better opportunity to have provided assistance in a timely manner.  Now you have asked us this morning; the witness is due to start giving examination this morning.  So, in that respect, it is last minute.  And it reduces the options for assistance that we can provide.  

Now, what I'm suggesting, as a practical step, is that if you identified those sections of the statement to which you intend to refer during your cross-examination, then that would facilitate any efforts that we might make to assist in having them translated into a language with which we can work.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I understand your position better, and we will in future make sure that we are more attentive to this rather recurrent question.  But it's so recurrent that we should, really, receive those translations spontaneously, without having to go to ask for them, once again.  But I will discuss the question with Mr. Ngirumpatse.  

But it is of course the opportunity for me to remind you of a recurrent problem that we are up against on a regular basis, which is the presence or absence of our investigators.  And I think that the Trial Chamber should be aware, at one stage or another, of the difficulties that numerous Defence teams are up against, in the sense that they are deprived of the assistance of their investigators, since the government of Kigali found new solutions to come in the way of the Defence and the investigators who work with us.  

Now, with reference to the documents that we would like to have translated, what we need to know is what they contain.  We are going to -- with Mr. Ngirumpatse and an interpreter speaking Kinyarwanda, we are going to look at those documents outside.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  In the meantime we think that what we will do, we will take a recess now to allow counsel to consider the issues which have been put on the table this morning.  I think -- would it be satisfactory if we resumed at 11 o'clock? 

Mr. Robinson, would that be enough time?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I believe so, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, also if I could just alert you to one other piece of business we are trying to conduct out of your presence, and that is that Witness AWB had agreed to meet with me outside of the presence of the Prosecutor.  And we began that meeting this morning, and he indicated he would like to have the Prosecutor present.  So we invited Mr. Webster in; Mr. Webster wants to have a translator from WVSS present.  So, we were waiting for that translator to arrive before resuming that meeting, which I think hopefully that translator has arrived and we can now take part in that meeting, and I think we can be completed by 11 o'clock also.  But if we're a little bit delayed, that's because of that.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you for informing us.  The Court will rise now.  
(Court recessed at 1015)
(Pages 1 to 10 by Kirstin McLean)






(Court resumed at 1110H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I think you have the first say.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  

We've had enough time now to consider everything.  So, basically, this is our position.  First, we would really like you to decide our motion and exclude the testimony of XBM in its entirety; we think that's the best solution.  

Second, with respect to the opportunity to have the testimony concerning the events at the 
Tam Tam bar stricken, we prefer that it not be stricken and prefer to defend those allegations, because we think that there's evidence -- not against Mr. Nzirorera, but against Witness XBM, because we'll be able to prove them false.  So, in tallying the ledger, we find more ticks in the column to our benefit than to our detriment and prefer to proceed with that evidence in the record.  

On the other hand, we are not really prepared to cross-examine this witness during this trial session with the sketchy information that I have available.  And I think I'll take you up on your offer to have us apply to bring the witness back and make the showing that we need to make after we conclude our investigations.  Because I think any further cross-examination on that subject, at this time, would really not be effective assistance of counsel on my behalf.  So I'm not going to ask for any further cross-examination at this time for Witness XBM.  

I also had the opportunity to read the judgement and a similar situation applies.  There are references to the meet -- to meetings at Umuganda stadium in the judgement; that they appear to be referring to meetings that occurred after the 6th of April 1994.  And when the comment about the meeting -- about a tape -- there was one reference in the judgement to a tape, and it doesn't indicate how -- what the content of that tape was.  

So, rather than spending my time speculating with this witness, I think I'd rather do more investigation and make an application to question the witness at a later time.  So that's where I stand on those things.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Is that the position of all the other counsel for the Defence -- of the Defence teams?  

MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Yes, Mr. President, the position I'd already expressed to you yesterday by the way, I confirm the same position, Mr. President.  And I add that we received all the material in English and that we need a little more time to comprehend what is said in these approximately 300 pages of transcript.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, by the way, the transcripts must exist in French.  We wonder why they were disclosed to us in the English version.  This must be to make our job more difficult, because it is well known that, at the end of the day, the documents are produced in French as well as in English -- yet another obstruction to the Defence's task.  You are aware that Karemera's team is always ready to give you examples of these complaints -- of these problems.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I think I have already expressed my position to the Court, but I will repeat it briefly.   And, that is, the Court is in a position now to make a judicial finding or to simply rule on this issue as a matter of law.  Both of the issues that were raised by the Defence are collateral to this trial.  There have been -- there has already been cross-examination on both of these issues.  The Defence have materials currently at their disposal to explore the matter further in cross-examination, if they choose to do so.  To provide an opportunity for further investigation to do discover extrinsic evidence, other witnesses, other documentation, that could then be introduced to contradict this -- this particular -- these two particular pieces of evidence would be collateral.  And if the Defence, during the defence phase, were to offer witnesses on this issue alone, the Prosecutor -- the Prosecution would oppose hearing those witnesses or receiving that evidence, because it's completely collateral, it goes only to the issue of credibility.  

I'd start off by saying that with respect to the transcripts that were disclosed, I think I made it clear yesterday and in my emails to the Defence, that I did not deem that material to be exculpatory, but in the interests of the broadest possible disclosure, I sent it on to the Defence.  The Appeals Chamber only two or three days ago issued a decision in the Niyitegeka case, that omissions in the account of one witness cannot be used necessarily to establish -- to impeach the testimony of another witness on the same set of facts, simply because there was an omission with respect to some of the factual recitations.  That's a decision coming from the Appeals Chamber only early this week, I believe.  And I think that's the issue that Mr. Robinson was pointing to as a matter of Rule 68 for that particular fact and that particular witness.  

So I would still maintain that the materials do not fall squarely within Rule 68.  The Defence have it.  We made it available.  It's not a basis to extend the examination of this witness.  The issue itself is collateral.  The issue was brought out by the Defence, not by the Prosecution. It was brought out by the Defence, not as Prosecution evidence but to impeach the witness's testimony, and it seems to me, as a matter of law, this Court should not allow additional evidence,  extrinsic evidence, to be brought in to impeach a statement that was made in 2005, when the whole purpose of this examination before this Trial Chamber is to examine this witness's testimony orally.  

Statement of the -- what the Defence are embarking upon, is not to impeach in-court testimony but to impeach a statement that was made in 2005, which was an out-of-court statement.  So, on those two bases, I would suggest to the Court that, as a matter of law, it can rule on what is -- seems to be a prospective Defence motion to bring extrinsic evidence or additional materials into this trial that need not be brought into the trial and would waste this Court's resources.  So, we should continue with the witness.  Mr. Robinson or any other Defence counsel wish to cross-examine further, they should do so and there should be no re-examination until the Defence have completed their cross-examinations.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, do you have any comment on the issue?  Are there French translations of the documents which were disclosed?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I am sure there are, Your Honour, because these were -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could efforts be made to address that issue?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, yes.
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, if I could just reply very briefly.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's not necessary, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
As far as I understand, you have not yet made any application, and we are not going to make a prospective ruling. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay, I understand that.  I want to point out one thing about Rule 68 which I think is really very serious.  And that is, Mr. Webster, he's at the helm of a tremendous responsibility for complying with Rule 68, and he consistently misapplies this rule to the point where the Trial Chamber cannot give deference any longer to the Prosecution's assessment under Rule 68.  The testimony that he disclosed yesterday that he said is not Rule 68 material, shows that the witness affirmatively stated that he had never seen Anatole Nsengiyumva before the end of May 1994, which is clearly Rule 68 -- 

MR. PRESIDENT:
It's not necessary to argue that point now.  I think what we have reached in this matter is that disclosures have been made; you have the information.  You have requested to defer your application for further cross-examination until further enquiries have been made.  We don't know -- nobody knows what those enquiries are going to reveal.  So it would be imprudent to even consider what a ruling would be at this stage.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
In connection with your ruling on the motion that is pending before you, what to do about the situation that got us here, wasting all this time? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But we have all the -- everything (inaudible) already.  Do you have an additional point you wish make to make?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Something that has not been mentioned already?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, I was just mentioning the fact that the Prosecution is -- needs an attitude adjustment for Rule 68, and I am asking you to give that message to them and --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, you have asked that already and we are considering it.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I think we have just heard further evidence that you need to make a ruling on that. Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  These are -- this is an important issue, and we think that nothing will be gained by rushing a decision, and we want to take some time and think.  We think that it's an important issue and we want to take sometime and think.  We are not avoiding a ruling.  We didn't think it was necessary to react impetuously, and that's what we are doing.  

Mr. Lahaie, you are (inaudible). 
MR. LAHAIE: 
Unfortunately, I did not understand your question, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I am about to recall Witness XBM for the purpose of re-examination.  Are you ready?  
MR. LAHAIE: 
As a matter of fact, no, Your Honour.  In fact, Mr. President, if the Defence is done with its cross-examination, the answer to your question would be yes, I am ready to proceed.  However, from all I have heard since the start of session, it has not been clarified whether the Defence is ready for cross-examination, and if -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I would ask the Defence again.  What I understood is this:  That the Defence have completed their cross-examination.  They have said that because of the possibility that they may obtain additional information, that, if they do, they will apply for further cross-examination.  I don't think -- if I understood their position correctly, that in my view is not a good reason to defer re-examination.  

Mr. Robinson, have I understood you?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's what I understood the position:  That they have completed their cross-examination, but if as a result of the information they get new information which requires further examination, at that time they will make an application to the Court.  I think that you should complete your re-examination now, and we will deal with that application when it arises, if it arises.  He doesn't even know if he will make such an application, until the investigation is completed.  So I think we should deal with what we have now, and deal with that matter if it arises in the future.  
MR. LAHAIE: 
So, in that case, given that we may return to redirect, I am ready to begin, and it will not be lengthy, I hope, at any rate.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Registrar, could you recall the witness. 
(Witness entered courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible)  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have come to the final phase of your testimony at this time.  As you may be aware, the Prosecutor has the right to ask you further questions on matters which arose out of your cross-examination.  Mr. Lahaie will now cross- re-examine you.
WITNESS XBM (continued)
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.
A.	Good morning.
Q.	Thank you for the statement dated 6 September 2005.
MR. PRESIDENT:
There is a problem.  The court reporters are not get any sound.  So could you please repeat that?

I had indicated to the witness that the practice and procedure allows the Prosecutor to ask questions on matters which arose in cross-examination and that you would be commencing your redirect at this time.  I don't think anybody got what you said as you rose to your feet, if you could please repeat it.  
MR. LAHAIE: 
I was asking that the witness be shown Exhibit D. NZ174.  So, to clarify the situation, Your Honours, there is a page that was added by my colleague Webster in the statement to make up for the loss of three or four lines missing from page 3.  So he has the original page and the addition.  The Defence has all of those documents, at least the dossiers for the Defence are complete.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President. Could the registrar show us that document again?  I just looked at the front page; it looked to be identical.  But I didn't realise there would be some change. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
If I could clarify matters, for the record.  I neglected to raise this earlier morning.  But when I offered yesterday to provide a copy of the statement with K numbers on it, I did that, I believe, it was earlier this morning.  But, at the bottom page 3, I believe, there is missing text because that's the statement that was sent to us by fax, it was not taken from our database.  We did not have the original.  It's a copy of the statement that arrived here in Arusha two days ago from Kigali.  As a result, I think the last three lines on page 3 were missing, because they were not scanned into the document.  But we have the Word document, which has exactly what was typed out.  And what I did was also include page 3 of the Word document so that you have what appears to be a original, because it bears the signature, but also the Word text, which everyone has because I circulated it by email, so you have the full text of that paragraph.  So, just to clarify that for the record, that's what I -- 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, we are all kind of surprised on this side.  Nobody seems to have received that email, and we have never seen the Word version of the document, we have only been dealing with the document which was given to us two days ago.  So, if we could all look, and we'll see how important this is.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
It was a Word document that was first circulated as a courtesy copy the first day that this came to our attention, and then afterwards there was the scanned copy.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I must say that I do not know if the document was sent, but I can assure the Chamber that it was not received, and has not been received to date.  

MR. WEBSTER: 
This is the document that was printed out and handed to all of the Defence counsel.  In fact, I hand-wrote a courtesy copy in red in the lower right-hand corner of the document.  That was the printout of Word text.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I would like to consult with my colleague Mr. Robinson on a technical issue.  Would the Chamber allow me to consult with him for a few moments?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Certainly.  

Mr. Weyl?  Mr. Weyl, we are actually hearing you.  Please keep your voice down.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I think the problem is that we have never seen a signed version of this statement, and the exhibit which I offered yesterday, Exhibit D. NZ174 was not signed because we had never -- from what we had known of the circumstances of the disclosure of this document, it was -- an electronic copy was sent to Mr. Webster by the investigators in Kigali, and they didn't have the document that had this witness's signature, they just had their own draft.  And that's the only thing that had been disclosed to us, and that was the document that had been -- that I thought was my exhibit.  Now we see that we have been provided with a copy that has been signed by the witness.  And, so, we are surprised by that, and we are also wondering how the Prosecution was able to locate the copy that was signed by the witness, since it's been contending all along that that copy was not in existence.  So perhaps they can explain how they were able to come up with a signed version of this exhibit, since they had said that the document had been lost. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
This is my understanding, Your Honours, and this is based on how I have been able to backtrack and figure out what transpired. But, apparently the statement was taken in Rwanda, the witness signed it.  The original of the statement was sent by pouch to Arusha.  We never received it, but the investigator that took the statement had a Xerox copy in his own files in Kigali.  When we get the statement in Arusha, we put it into our database, and that's when it gets stamped with the K numbers.  With this particular statement, it had not been input into the database because it had not been received in Arusha.  So all we had was a Xerox copy that remained in Rwanda.  When I made the request several days ago, the investigator sent me the Word version, which I immediately printed out and disclosed to the parties.  That was followed up by a scanned version of the signed statement, which also arrived by email.  That was printed out, put into our database, and that's what I gave to the registry this morning.  

Page 3 of that scanned version missed -- has dropped text, because it did not scan into whatever computer text was generated.  So, in order to have a complete text that bears signatures, I took one page from the Word text and appended it to that signed document so that at least, in looking through the document, you could read all of the text that the Defence already had received two or three days ago.  

This is something that I should have addressed with the Chamber early this morning, but because other things -- we were dealing with other business, it slipped my mind until this particular moment.  By as soon as Mr. Lahaie asked that the exhibit be shown to the witness, I suggested to him that he bring this matter to everyone's attention.  So that's how we get to this point.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, by your leave. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated) 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I think the problem we are stressing is even more grave.  Peter Robinson, yesterday, offered a document that was given Exhibit No. D. NZ174, which was the only document he had in his possession, which is a Word document, unsigned.  The exhibit number given to the registry, D. NZ174 is, therefore, an unsigned draft, in Word version.  Now, I have before me a document which bears the mention D. NZ exhibit 174 under seal, with the seal of the registry; a signed document that is not the one admitted into evidence, with reservations at the request of Mr. Robinson.  In that case, this is perhaps Exhibit P. 35; that is the signed version.  But I do not understand how we can witness substitution of a document between D. NZ174 Word unsigned, and a document that was received by the registry, without the intention of the parties or the Chamber, which is not the document received yesterday afternoon.  Who is running the registry?  Is it the registry under the supervision of the Trial Chamber?  Or does the Prosecutor have access to the registry to ask the registrar to substitute a document admitted in a format -- in a certain format with a document that was not communicated to the parties, which is different?  The way exhibits are received in your Court, this being a document P. 35 not D. NZ174.  I am requesting that this be noted and put on record.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, we would have heard you, even if you were not so passionate.  And, you may recall that yesterday afternoon when the document was being admitted, Mr. Webster had indicated that he had another version of the document which had the proper K numbers on it.  So we granted permission for the K number document to be substituted for the exhibit that had been tendered by Mr. Robinson.  It is true that at the time we were not aware that one document was signed and the other was unsigned.  So the issue is not so much the registry, because the registry had been authorised by the Court to accept the K-number document from Mr. Webster.  

Now, I don't know to what extent the issue of the signature is very significant, but that is the issue that one needs to address.  What do we do about that? 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I would like to remind the Trial Chamber of the objections I raised yesterday with regard to admissibility of the contested exhibit.  The Chamber said that we had a debate, but it seems that at the stage we had reached yesterday, we were in the realm of cross-examination based on documents produced by the Defence under the conditions in which they are produced.  And given now we are dealing with a document emanating from the Prosecutor that is problematic, how can we deal with documents that were not disclosed?  Now, I am bringing this up because I have been informed of it, just as I am about to present it to the witness, and that I find an extraordinary circumstance.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, I actually thought I was helping all of the parties in the proceedings by providing a statement that the witness had signed.  But if it's problematic, maybe we can withdraw the signed version; we will admit what Mr. Robinson had yesterday, which has no K numbers, which is just a Word text, and we can proceed from there.  Because it really doesn't matter from our perspective, but I was hoping that we'd have as complete a record as possible.  But I will leave it to the Court's discretion.  I think I have explained the situation thoroughly.  I really don't see where the controversy is.  We can proceed any way the Court deems appropriate.
(Pages 11 to 19 by Judith Baverstock)




















1145H 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, is there a difference in the content of the two documents?  Is the only issue the question of the signature?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, you must note how difficult it is for the Defence to follow the pace imposed by the Prosecutor, deal with a document six pages long, compare it to another document, in the middle of the hearing.  It is, therefore, difficult, and I hope it is understood by the Chamber.  

I would like to say -- I'm sorry to have to come in again.  I do not think we received the photocopy as yet; that it is in our files as an exhibit.  What -- the version communicated by the Prosecutor, I do not have that copy.  We cannot be compiling documents which -- really, that demands some respect for the Defence.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Just to clarify the record, the initial text was hand-delivered to each one of the Defence teams, and a formal submission was made to CMS.  But with CMS things take a day or two to be processed through their system.  So it was formally disclosed and it was also informally disclosed.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, what we think we will do is that we will allow the document tendered by Mr. Robinson to be the court exhibit.  So we will direct that to take place.  If, in due course, there is a joint request to have the document substituted, we will make that order.  

So the witness should be shown the document that was used in cross-examination yesterday.  

We did not hear the English translation of the complaint of the technical problem of the interpreter's booth.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The English booth does not have a way of listening in to the French booth.  Therefore, I could not interpret what was said by the French booth, although I overheard it through the glass pane.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay, is there anything that we need to do to assist in that, or has the problem been resolved now?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Okay, there is a technical hitch.  The French booth can hear themselves speak.  Therefore, it is impossible for them to work hearing themselves, the speakers on the floor, and having to speak at the same time.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
Madam Registrar, could you get the technical booth to assist, please.  

It appears that we have to rise for a short while, while the problem is being resolved.  It's going to take a little time.  
(Court recessed from 1158H to 1226H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I think the problem has been resolved.  You may proceed. 
MR. LAHAIE: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	Well, Witness, I see that you used the unforeseen break to read the statement of the 6th of September 2005; am I correct in so thinking?  
A.	Yes, you are.  
Q.	So, it is indeed the statement that you gave to the investigators, is it not?  
A.	That is correct. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, the English booth can no longer hear the Kinyarwanda booth.  So I'm awfully sorry.  
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	Did you sign each of the pages?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Look, please -- please wait one moment.  There's another problem. 

Can you check on the translators?  

The English booth is now having a problem.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Yes, Mr. President.  Unfortunately I can't hear the Kinyarwanda booth, so when the witness speaks and they put it into French, I'm afraid I can't hear them.  I'm sorry.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, are we sitting in this courtroom this afternoon?  I was told we may be sitting in courtroom number 4.  I was just wondering.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Registrar, could you confirm the position -- 

You know, we are scheduled to sit in courtroom 4 for the whole of the day, but this was available this morning, so we took advantage.  And there is a possibility that we may have to surrender it this afternoon.  

But, Madam Registrar, could you confirm the position, please.  
MS. KOUO:  
This afternoon we will be sitting at courtroom 4.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
So why don't we take our lunch recess and leave this problem to the next people that are coming in?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Lahaie, do you agree with Mr. Robinson's suggestion?  
MR. LAHAIE: 
My response to that, Mr. President, is that even if it is somewhat cynical, I am totally in agreement.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, I think you have unanimous support.  At last.  

We will take the adjournment now.  

Mr. Witness, we hope the technical problems will not prevent the completion of your testimony today.  But, we are going to change courtrooms, and we will be sitting in another courtroom this afternoon.  And hopefully things will be much better.  

So we take the luncheon break now.  
(Court recessed at 1235H)

1425H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.  

Madam registry, are the audio problems completely resolved now?  Is everybody hearing everybody?  
MS. KOUO:
I think so, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Perhaps we can try to get the testimony of the witness completed.  

Mr. Witness, your re-examination will take place now.  I trust that the new courtroom will allow things to go through without any further technical interruptions.  

Mr. Lahaie. 
MR. LAHAIE:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	Witness, you have just received document D. NZ174 again this afternoon.  Is it the same document you saw this morning? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	This morning you said that it was, indeed, the statement that you made to ICTR investigators on the  6th of September 2005; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, counsel is overlapping with witness.  And he may be -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Lahaie, the interpreters request that there is a pause between your question and the witness's answer, and vice versa, as the microphones are overlapping. 
MR. LAHAIE:
I will take good note of that, Mr. President.  Thank you. 
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	You said, Witness, that you had signed that statement; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Once again, Mr. President, we missed out on the first part of Mr. Lahaie's question? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Lahaie, the interpreters say they did not hear the first part of your question. 
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	Did you sign each single page of the entire statement, Witness? 
A.	Yes, I signed each sheet on which excerpts of my statement were contained. 
Q.	The statement, does it contain the truth?
A.	Yes, it does contain the truth. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I have no other questions for you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, it seems that you have at last come to the end of your testimony before this trial at this time.  As you know, there are some occasions when the Trial Chamber may require you to return.  But if that eventually occurs, we will deal with it if necessary.  

But as of now your business with our Trial Chamber has been concluded and you are now free, free to go.  We thank you for coming to give evidence.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam registrar, the new witness is on his way in, I presume?  
MS. KOUO:
I believe so, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good day, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We thank you for coming to give evidence before the Tribunal.  The first step in your giving testimony is to take an oath to tell the truth.  The registrar will now administer the oath to you. 
(Declaration made by the Witness AWB in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, the method of operating in giving your testimony is that the lawyers designated for that purpose will ask you questions, and you will answer their questions.  Your answers constitute the evidence that will be adduced in our judgement in this trial.  The Prosecutor will be the first lawyer who will question you.  

And I will now invite Mr. Lahaie to commence your examination. 

MR. LAHAIE:
For the first part of his testimony I would request it be done in closed session. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, before we go into closed session; this morning, we had a meeting with this witness and, we had first gone in to see him without the Prosecutor, as he had requested. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Lahaie -- thank you. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
So we had met him without the presence of the Prosecutor very briefly.  And he told us that he did, in fact, wish the Prosecutor to be present.  So we stopped our meeting, and we asked Mr. Webster to join us, which he did after the break that we took at quarter -- between 10:15 and 11 o'clock.  

And then when we returned with Mr. Webster, the witness informed Mr. Webster and us that he did not want to -- that he did not intend to give testimony in the trial.  So we, again, left, and we thanked him, because we did not think that under those circumstances it would be fruitful to have any -- to ask him any questions about his testimony.  

So at this time I would -- I would like to ask you to call on the witness to clarify his position.  And if it is now his intention to give testimony, we would like the opportunity to meet with him beforehand, or if it is not his intention to testify, I think this would be the right time for him to express that as he did to us this morning.  So I put that out there for whatever actions you deem appropriate. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, it shouldn't surprise you that I have a slightly different recollection of the meeting where I was present with the Defence counsel.  But I would -- rather then go into what I thought I heard, and I may be mistaken, I think the more appropriate thing to do is for the Court to do as Mr. Robinson has suggested and ask the witness what he said and what he intended.  I remember something different, but I would rather the witness explain himself to the Court. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we are not going to again adjudicate on what actually transpired.  

But, Mr. Witness, have you heard the exchanges that occurred between counsel just now?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I heard everybody, Mr. President; and, in fact, that is what happened.  I took this decision last night.  I realised that there was no point in giving testimony in this court, in this trial because I had been called as a Prosecution witness.  I had made it clear to the Prosecutor and the Defence counsel that I did not intend to testify.  I said I was prepared to speak to the Defence counsel in the absence of the Prosecutor.
In fact, I would like to tell you I am not prepared to appear as a Prosecution witness.  I am not prepared to testify.  I have just been sworn in, taken the oath.  And I cannot come to tell lies whereas I have already taken an oath, I cannot violate that oath.  I would like to ask for the forgiveness of the Prosecutor because I know I lied on many occasions.  I also apologise to your Trial Chamber because I have told a lot of lies, and I no longer want to lie.  That is the situation.  

I was called as a Prosecution witness; therefore I was supposed to come to testify against the Accused.  And I can confirm events -- the events did occur, but the Accused I was supposed to testify against did not play a role in those incidents in Rwanda.

I often give testimony.  So for -- somebody who had his own interests to protect said that I should come and mention this person in all of the statements I made.  I agreed to do this.  I accepted the offer made to me, and I mentioned that person's name.  But last night over the radio I heard that there was a trial in which an Accused person I was testifying against, appeared.  When I was to return to Rwanda -- rather when I return to Rwanda I will testify against that person.  And the acts he is accused of are the same as those of the person -- the charges brought against the person here.  So that I do not see how I can say that the same act was committed by different perpetrators.  These acts were committed by the person in Rwanda.  I did not come here to attribute those facts to the person here.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Well, Your Honour, I must admit I am taken by surprise because I did not understand that to be what the witness said when we met earlier this morning; so, clearly, I was in error, because the witness should know what he said and what he meant.  

What I can clarify for the Court, however, is that early this morning when we were to meet with this witness, the meeting that was originally planned for 8:30 a.m. did not take place because there was no interpreter.  And we ran into a bit of delay.  And then it came to light that it was not Mr. Robinson that was going to speak to the witness; it was Mr. Weyl and Madam Hounkpatin.  

Since the witness's consent to be interviewed was directed to Mr. Robinson, I then went in to see the witness, which was the first time I met him.  And I asked if he would consent to meet with             Madam Weyl -- excuse me, Mr. Weyl and Madam Hounkpatin for the Accused Ngirumpatse, which was a bit of a shift.  And when he -- when I clarified that with him, he said there would be no problem, that he would be willing to meet with those two attorneys.  And at that point he did not indicate in any respect that he was not willing to testify.  

Afterwards, Mr. Robinson, Mr. Weyl and Madam Hounkpatin  went in to meet with the witness, along with Mr. Nsengiyumva, and I don't know how many other people because there was a group of them outside of the waiting room.  And I left them on their own since the witness had indicated that he did not require or request the presence of the Prosecutor.  And when they came out to -- I'm referring to the attorneys -- came out to see me, they indicated that the witness wanted my presence in their meeting.  So when I returned to the room with the other Defence counsel, my understanding was that the witness simply did not want to speak to the Defence counsel.  

Now clearly I was mistaken because if the witness had indicated, or if I had understood him to indicate that he did not want to testify I certainly would have made further enquiries, or brought the matter to the attention of the Court or I would have done something; I would not have done nothing, which is what I did because my assumption is that he simply did not want to meet with the Defence attorney.  

Clearly, I was wrong.  The witness has clarified the matter for us.  This is the first time I'm learning of it.  I must say that our exchange lasted no more than two minutes because it was simple -- simply for me anyway, a matter -- my understanding was that the witness did not want that meeting to take place.  But now it seems that the witness does not want his testimony to take place.  So, I leave the matter in the hands of the Court.  That is all I know about the matter.

I would add, however, that I would think that the Defence had met with the witness for at least ten or   15 minutes when I was not present, because when I saw them leave for the room the time it took for them to come back and tell me that my presence was required was around ten or 15 minute later.  I don't know if they were meeting that entire time.  But clearly, to my mind anyway, something transpired between this morning when the witness was willing to meet with the Defence attorneys and said nothing to me about not wanting to testify, and the subsequent meeting.  But I leave that for the Court to reason through.  And I will simply await the Court's recommendation of how we should proceed.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please, please, we are still in the courtroom.  

Mr. Webster, we don't think that we should make a proprie modus (phonetic) decision on what to do about the witness.  So we expect you to apply as to what steps you would expect to take place with regard to his testimony.  If you -- but before you do that, there are a few questions we want to ask the witness.

Mr. Witness, you appreciate that as a trial -- Trial Chamber, we are taken a bit by surprise by the fact that you are actually here, present before us and make the statement that you've made just now.  So, there are a few matters which we think we should enquire of you to protect the integrity of our          Trial Chamber.  
Now the first thing that is of interest to me is how often have you met with investigators and Prosecutors concerning your testimony in this matter?  Do you recall?  
THE WITNESS:
I do not remember the number of times I met them any more; nevertheless, I do know that I met them on several occasions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, do you recall how many statements you made; how many statements you signed, that were reduced to writing?  
THE WITNESS:
I no longer recall the number of statements I signed, but I remember the testimony I gave to the investigators.  However, as I made those statements, Mr. President, I would like to tell you this; there is one person who led the investigators to me.  The investigators did not just think up where I lived, and said, this is where X lives let's asked him questions about Y.  I have no relation to the person against whom I have been asked to testify, that person is not even my neighbour.  

So there is one person who brought the investigators to me and that individual made me tell lies to the investigators, because that person knew what statements I had made in Rwanda.  I have relied on the guilty plea and confession procedure in the past; so that individual was aware of my guilty plea and confession.  And since this individual had something to gain from my testifying against these Accused, he came to see me and asked that I help him by testifying against the Accused in this Tribunal.  That individual was detained together with me.  He knows me very well.  However, right now he is a free man.  

So, the testimony I gave in Rwanda, in that testimony I removed someone's name and I added Ngirumpatse's name.  I will not give the name of that person because he is on trial in Rwanda.  I knew there was a person accused in Rwanda and against whom I was to testify.  And since I would not like to tell lies in your Court, I will go to Rwanda, this time truthfully against a detainee in Rwanda.  And in Rwanda I would be considered a fool if I were to agree to testify here whereas I am yet to testify in Rwanda.

Yesterday for some time I listened to broadcasts on Radio Rwanda and I found out that there are persons -- or another person arrested in Rwanda had began his trial, and decided to testify in his trial in Rwanda instead of testifying against the person detained here.  Therefore, my conscience told me not to lie about the person detained here because I had, in fact, been asked to remove a name from testimony in Rwanda, and slot in Ngirumpatse's name.  I decided not to do this, but I will just testify in Rwanda.  
When the Defence lawyers came to see me, I said, no, I do not want to meet you in the absence of a representative from the Prosecutor's office.  I asked who was representing the Prosecutor.  When they came to see me, I told them to go and fetch a person from the Office of the Prosecutor before they saw me.  So they came back with a representative from the OTP.  And I told that representative I did not want to testify any more.  And I said I would outline the reasons for my refusal to testify to the Prosecutor.  So I, therefore, hoped to meet the Prosecutor in order to explain the reasons to him.  

But to my surprise, I just noticed I was brought into the room.  And for that reason, I decided to tell you this after taking the oath.  That is all I want to say.  I have nothing to say about the individuals detained here.  

Furthermore, in my view I should not give the name of the person who brought the investigators to meet me, because that person could most likely be a Prosecution witness, nor do I want to talk about the other trial that is under way in Rwanda, because I have not yet been called to appear in that trial.  This is what I would like to tell you, Your Honours.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, how long have you been in Arusha, on this trip?  
THE WITNESS:
I arrived in Arusha on the 15th of May; that is to say then, that I have just spent more than 50 days here. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, during that time, have you had any meetings with investigators or with lawyer in this trial?  
THE WITNESS:
I met one investigator who told me the Prosecutor was unavailable but that he would come to meet me when the time was right.  So the Prosecutor came to meet me on the 4th, in the evening.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness does not give the month.  
THE WITNESS:
So he came in the evening of the 4th to meet me for the first time here.  We were not able to speak.  And yesterday he came to meet me -- I mean the Prosecutor.  And the next occasion on which I saw him was today. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you saying that since you have been in Arusha, you have spoken to lawyers prosecuting this    case -- you have met lawyers prosecuting this case on only three occasions and you have not given them any statements?  Is that what you are saying?  
THE WITNESS:
I spoke to them.  We spoke about my testimony, but at that time I had not yet taken the decision which I took yesterday evening. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
When was the last time you spoke to the lawyers from the Prosecutor about your testimony?  
THE WITNESS:
The last time I spoke to the Prosecutor about my testimony was yesterday.  Yesterday I met him for a few hours, we spoke about my testimony.  And so yesterday, after my meeting with him, in my room I decided that I would not testify. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  So yesterday afternoon you left the Prosecutor with the impression that you were going to testify?  
THE WITNESS:
When I parted from the Prosecutor, I still wanted to testify; I was still intent on testifying. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
At what time (microphone overlapping) --  
THE WITNESS:
At any rate (microphone overlapping) -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
At what time would that have been?  
THE WITNESS:
At approximately 12 or 1 p.m. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, when was it you said that you took the decision not to testify?  
THE WITNESS:
It was last night when I got to my bedroom, 17 (sic) hours -- or 19 (sic) hours Kigali time and               20 (sic) hours here, because at that time Radio Rwanda was broadcasting the news.  Furthermore,   Mr. President I believe that it is better to -- for me to tell the truth rather than sit down here and lie, I would rather speak the truth.  I am a Christian.  

Even if I hadn't taken the decision last night, and having taken the oath, I don't think I would have proceeded to testify.  But you know, I would like you to know that I took this decision before coming to take the oath.  But even after taking the oath, I could not come here to testify and tell lies.  I thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now after you took the decision, did you have any discussion with the Prosecutor about your decision?  
THE WITNESS:
I took the decision last night.  I went to bed; and this morning when I got up I didn't have an opportunity to meet the Prosecutor.  However, the Prosecutor's representative who had met me with the Defence counsels, I told them that I had come to the decision not to testify.  But I promised them to explain to the Prosecutor that I was going to behave in that matter.  So I was surprised when I was brought into the courtroom, because my understanding was that I was going to meet the Prosecutor to tell him my decision.  But now that I am before you, Mr. President, I would like to tell you what my position is.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Had you explained your position to any other authority?  
THE WITNESS:
I took the decision not to testify last night.  At that time I was alone in my bedroom.  This morning I was taken from the place of accommodation to come here.  So I did not meet any official at night.  And I could not have communicated my idea to anyone else except the Prosecutor.  Now, I am telling you what my position is, Mr. President.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I would like to offer just one or two additional comments and then perhaps the Court may wish to address the witness again.  But this morning when the interpreter from WVSS arrived in the waiting room, I entered the room with the interpreter.  And the first thing I did was identify myself to this witness.  And I explained to him that I was a Prosecutor on the case, that I worked directly with          Mr. Lahaie, and with Mr. Muto (phonetic), who had met with him the day before.  And that I was going to arrange for him to speak with the Defence counsel that he had agreed to meet with.  

And at that time, as far as I understood, based on the witness's responses to me, I was left with the impression that he understood what my role in this case was, and that I was working with Mr. Lahaie, and with Mr. Muto.  And I made that quite clear.  And at that time he seemed -- he -- I had no indication that there was any problem with his testimony going forward.  And the only issue I raised with him was whether he would be willing, also, to meet with the counsel for Mr. Ngirumpatse.  And after he indicated that he would, I promptly informed Mr. Weyl and Mr. Robinson.  And that is when the rest of these events sort of went forward.  

When I left the meeting with Defence attorneys and this witness, I was still under the impression that his testimony was going forward.  Now, clearly, that was my mistake because the Defence attorneys and the witness are giving a consistent account, but I was left with the impression that he did not want the meeting to go forward, not that he did not want his testimony to go forward.  

So, just to reiterate, I am completely taken by surprise at this moment.  If I had any indication earlier on that this witness was not going to be a willing witness, than certainly I would have taken some other precautions or I would have raised the issue with the Trial Chamber or we would not even have had the witness brought in to be sworn.  So, clearly the Prosecution was always in the mode of moving forward with this witness's testimony, had no idea whatsoever that he had a change of heart, particularly in light of the fact that I had spoken with him this morning, and introduced myself as a member of the Prosecution team and arranged for him to meet with the Defence in the interest of moving his testimony forward.  

So I can only surmise that something transpired during his meeting with the Defence because there was no indication from this witness prior to meeting with the Defence that he did not want to testify at this trial.  Now hearing that from this witness, I am not inclined to ask the Court to force him to testify.  We don't want to move forward with his evidence.  I would like to give the matter some further thought, however, because that is not the end of the issue for us.  

This witness's evidence was incorporated in our indictment.  There are at least one or two specific paragraphs that were drafted exclusively on his testimony.  So, the issue is not a dead issue for us.  We may not take his evidence at this time, or in this trial.  But the issue is far from dispensed with as far as we are concerned.  But I can't say where we are going with it.  It is going to take a bit more thought before we know how we would like to proceed.  We are not interested in hearing his evidence as part of the Prosecution case, but I don't think that this is an issue that should be swept aside.  There are other things that need to be explored by the Trial Chamber in relation to this witness, and in relations to how we all participated in where we find ourselves at this moment. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, can I ask you another question?  Are you -- what is your status in Rwanda at the moment?  Are you free; are you in detention; are you -- what is your status according to the judicial process in Rwanda?  
THE WITNESS:
I am an inmate. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you an inmate in detention, waiting trial; are you convicted?  I don't need to know what crime you are convicted of, I need to know what is your status? 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I was already sentenced by the gacaca system in our secteur to 25 years of imprisonment.  I have appealed against that judgement before the gacaca system in our secteur.  I am expected to appear before the gacaca -- or I was expected to appear at the gacaca in mid-May, but at that time I was already here.  So upon my return to Rwanda, I will again appear before the gacaca.  That is my status, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL: 
Obliged, Mr. President.  I am on my feet, Mr. President, following the first comments by Mr. Webster.  You also gave the floor to the witness because you deemed it necessary to hear from the witness's own mouth what had actually transpired.  Now, I also am on my feet, Mr. President, because once again   Mr. Webster raised some issues, and made insinuations about the Defence which were not very well taken.  But after Mr. Webster spoke the third time, the same insinuations were repeated.

Now, the same thing happens, Mr. President, whenever Mr. Webster is in difficulties, he shifts the burden to the Defence.  And you said, Mr. President, that it is not for you to serve as an arbiter between the statements that are made by various parties.  But, again, Mr. President, Mr. Webster has again repeated the same thing, which amounts to an insult to the Defence.  

Let me say, Mr. President, that the code of ethics, Article 17, provides that all parties in the Tribunal must be treated with fairness, integrity and courtesy; matters of dignity, may I say, and this must be done with reciprocity.  When Counsel Webster, the Prosecutor, tells you that Mr. Robinson is a liar, that we are all liars, although we haven't said a thing; that is not acceptable, Mr. President.  

Following Mr. Webster's first statement, I didn't say anything.  I rose, but I didn't say anything on his second statement.  But a third time around, Mr. President, when he insinuated these things against us, I still didn't say anything.  But let me say now, Mr. President, that we would like the record to show that we are committed to conduct Defence cases with dignity.  And we suppose that the Prosecutor would do the same, and that he would also be mindful of his duties, as well as of the duties of the Bench.  On these grounds, I would ask that he withdraw all of those statements that he has made regarding the Defence, without having to depend on any justification from the -- from the witness.

I believe, therefore, that there is no need for the statement of the representative of the WVSS, or of the witness, or of any other party to be made for this statement to be withdrawn by Mr. Webster, who in his offhanded statement does not reflect the fair nature of the trial.

Mr. President, therefore, I request that these statements be withdrawn.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Well, Your Honours, what I can say, or remind all of the parties to these proceedings is my recollection of where I started in this intervention, which is basically with an apology because I misunderstood what transpired when we were all in the same room together, and here I am referring to the Defence, the witness and myself, because I understood the witness to say that he no longer wanted to proceed with the meeting.  

Now, clearly that was my error.  The witness has clarified that.  And Mr. Robinson and Mr. Weyl have made representations to the Court, so I misunderstood what had been translated to me.  It was a very brief exchange, but I assumed the witness was talking about the meeting that had been arranged, that he no longer wanted to go forward with that meeting.  So, the Court and all of the parties have my apologies for my misunderstanding, but I made that quite clear when I took the floor initially.  What is also something I can say unequivocally is that when I met with the witness this morning, he gave no indication this morning, whatsoever, of not wanting to go forward with his testimony.  I explained in no uncertain terms that I was a member of the Prosecution team, and that I worked directly with Mr. Lahaie and Mr. Muto, and the persons who had met with him previously.  That was clear as far as I could see.  

The witness gave no indication whatsoever that things should not go forward.  In the interests of  making -- having things go forward, I then contacted -- I then solicited Mr. Weyl and Madam Hounkpatin and Mr. Robinson to come in and meet with the witness.  It is only now after that meeting that it seems that there is a problem with going forward with this witness's testimony.  

So I don't think there is anything I have to withdraw in all that I have said this morning.  All I can do is to reinforce the things that I have already said.

I would point out to the Court that this witness has been to Arusha at least twice before to testify in this case.  He met with investigators in Rwanda when he first gave his statement.  He confirmed that statement in, I believe, it was in November of 2005 when Mr. Lahaie went to Rwanda and met with the witness for the first time at that time, so he met with a member of the Prosecution team, not just an investigator, I believe this was in November 2005.  And then came to Arusha twice before, because he was scheduled to testify in the previous two trial sessions.  I may be in error, maybe not the first, but as least once before.  This is not the first time he has come to Arusha for this trial.  

The investigator -- the crime analyst and one of the associate legal officers on my team met with this witness at least three or four weeks ago when he first came to Arusha, and did the first stage -- the first phase of our trial preparation with him.  And I believe that took at least a day or two.  And I did not learn anything from them that would indicate that this witness was not going forward with his testimony.  

And then when it became clear to us that we would have to move his testimony up, and take this witness, AWB, a much shorter witness than AOG, at that point Mr. Lahaie and another member of our staff met with him at least two or three times.  And I believe the last meeting they had with him was at around 6 p.m. yesterday.  And at that -- I just spoke to my colleague.  He tells me that there was no indication at that time that the witness had a change of heart in regard to his testimony.  

The first indication of that to me was just a half hour ago in this courtroom.  I was not aware of that before.  So, that is where we stand.  
MR. LAHAIE:
Respectfully, I, in fact, met the witness Tuesday until 6 p.m., between approximately 5 and 6.  And I met him yesterday during the lunch break, rather between 11 and 1 p.m., something like that.  And there was no question of the witness not having told the truth in the past, nor was there such a question raised this morning.  Therefore, this is news to me.  

As for the arguments brought by Mr. Weyl, if we are to calculate the number of times that the Defence has accused the Prosecution of dishonesty, I think that it would be more on his side. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The issue of civility between counsel is a matter which I don't need to address now.  

Mr. Webster, what is of interest to us now, first of all, is there going to be any application on the part of the Prosecution to compel this witness to give testimony?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
No, Your Honour. 
(Pages 23 to 35 by Donna M. Lewis)

















1532H 
MR. WEBSTER:
No, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What -- what -- what are you going to do about him?  
MR. WEBSTER:
In terms of providing evidence for this Court, I would simply request that he be returned to Rwanda.  In terms of taking any other measures, I'd have to think about it a bit.  I've been looking through the -- our Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Nothing comes immediately to mind.  I'm going to have to think about the issue more carefully, but we do not intend to go forward with his evidence as part of the Prosecution case.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, after having heard your statement and having heard the -- the -- the application from the Prosecutor, we've decided to excuse you, and you may leave now.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  May I make a small intervention before the witness leaves? 

First of all, I appreciate -- I think you -- the way you've handled this has been very correct, and you asked a lot of good questions.  But some questions you didn't ask were -- you kind of stopped at the point of our meeting with this witness.  And I just -- I don't want the witness to leave with anybody having even a scintilla of doubt in their mind about whether we did anything to encourage this witness not to testify, especially in light of battles that I've fought with Mr. Webster over even trying to have a meeting with the witness.  So I would ask you to enquire of this witness about the circumstances of our meeting, to ask him whether he'd ever met me or anyone from the Defence before, so that when we all leave this courtroom we realise that what this witness has done today is an act of courage of his own volition, is not a product of any influence from anyone.  And I -- I think that that's -- when you speak of the integrity of the proceedings, that's an essential component, that there be no question that Defence has influenced this witness.  

Secondly, once you're convinced of that, you see from what this witness has told you what is going on in Rwanda with the business of accusing people like Mr. Ngirumpatse and Mr. Nzirorera, and that should also have a great -- cause you great concern about the integrity of these proceedings.  And so I would ask that you make those enquiries.  

And since I won't be addressing the witness any further, I want to thank the witness for his courage and for his honesty today.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, although I understand the reason for your request, we think that the position we adopted, we ought to maintain it.  We don't think it's proper for us to conduct evidentiary hearings of matters of this nature and make judgements as to whether one counsel or another is telling the truth in matters of this nature.  

Secondly, we don't think that we are an appropriate body to carry out any investigations into the reasons for the witness's change of heart.  And I -- I don't think that it would be appropriate for us to embark on those enquiries in any form or fashion.  If -- if it's -- anybody desires to investigate, they can do that, but we can't carry out any investigation of this sort.  So we think that that -- our -- our -- it is not by accident that we didn't ask him any questions about it.  We think it would not be an appropriate course for us to adopt.  

Mr. Witness, you are excused.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
(Witness excused) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, we have one more week. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  Is that where the -- was that a -- a -- a -- a question mark or an exclamation point at the end of that phrase? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I thought it was a rhetorical comment.  The question was obvious.  Do you have any other witnesses that we can hear? 
MR. WEBSTER:
No, Your Honour, we have no other witnesses.  I think there are matters that we can probably work through in terms of our exhibits, and there are pending motions.  There's the issue of the judicial notice motion that Mr. Robinson had suggested that he make submissions on, so I'm sure there are ways that we can make productive use of the time ahead of us.  But I don't think one of our options is to take testimony from any factual witnesses.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  

Mr. Webster, were you sort of -- were we the benefit of a very subtle -- subtle comment whose name was not mentioned?  

MR. WEBSTER:
I don't understand.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
When you mentioned evidentiary matters, were you proposing to call Mr. Baghel as a witness?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So when can you start?  
MR. WEBSTER:
We haven't even begun his preparation, Your Honour.  It's not something that can begin tomorrow. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but can you start on Monday? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, that's a possibility, but then -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Has there been information communicated to the other -- to the other side? 
MR. WEBSTER:
No.  I mean, other than our exhibit bundle that was disclosed some time ago, we had not anticipated taking testimony from Mr. Baghel at this session.  I'm suggesting him as a fill-in, and we'd have to, you know -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)...when -- when -- when --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, sir, the French booth is struggling.  Thank you, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are speaking too fast and -- and not pausing.  

But my question is not addressed to you only, but -- but -- but I think that the trial process in general would be assisted if Mr. Baghel gave his testimony. 
MR. WEBSTER:
No, I agree.  That's why I suggested it -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.
MR. WEBSTER:
-- it's not something that I'm resisting.  In fact, I thought I had mentioned that as an option last week when we were discussing the same issue.  So it's clearly something that we'd like to pursue, but I'm simply trying to make the Court and all of the parties aware of the constraints.  Because he would be able to complete his testimony.  He's still an active member of our team.  That means that if he starts to give testimony, he's going to be speaking to members of the team during the course of his testimony.  

He can put certain exhibits in evidence.  Mr. Robinson has already indicated that some of the exhibits that we intend to offer are going to be contentious.  It's going to require legal argument.  We can do those legal arguments piecemeal and move ahead.  But he can't -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Excuse me. 
MR. WEBSTER:
-- as a member of our team during the course of -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, too fast. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Oh, I'm sorry.  

My suggestion to the Court is that the we use the time profitably.  I'm not suggesting that we simply abandon the session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
My -- my question is this:  Next week we have four and a half days.  How much time do you anticipate his testimony will take?  
MR. WEBSTER:
As far as the Prosecution is concerned, his testimony could take two hours.  Because all of the exhibits -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Two hours. 
MR. WEBSTER:
-- could be admitted without contention, but that's not going to happen -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping) 
MR. WEBSTER:
-- so, as a practical matter, in the past when I have examined this particular witness, I recall a proceeding where it took several weeks.  And I would imagine that the issues in this trial are more complex because there's more materials that he would put in evidence.  
My understanding of Mr. Robinson's position is that those exhibits should not be going in through an investigator.  They should go in through factual witnesses that could lay more of a foundation.  So these are all contentious matters -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
A little bit too fast.  
MR. WEBSTER:
-- we resort to him -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Slow down, please.
MR. WEBSTER:
We resort to him -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's better. 
MR. WEBSTER:
-- only as a backup.  It's not something that we would prefer to do.  We are simply trying to use the time in the best possible manner.  What I would appreciate -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can I ask you a question? 
MR. WEBSTER:
(Microphones overlapping) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are there any disclosure issues with regard to his testimony, or -- or -- or is it -- or, can we programme it for Monday?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Given the past practice in this trial, there are always disclosure matters, so I can't imagine that there would be a witness for whom there aren't disclosure matters that are contentious, practically speaking.  We do our best.  We make the best -- as expansive disclosure as we -- as we can, but there's always been a disclosure issue with every witness.  And I don't think that that's going to -- to change despite our best efforts.  

So what I would appreciate from the Court is an opportunity to review our situation with respect to him and an opportunity to review outstanding issues in the trial and then to come up with a suggestion of what would be most productive for next week.  So if we took tomorrow to do that, we're -- at the end of business tomorrow, we could probably make a suggestion so that we'd be on a good footing to start Monday morning knowing what we're doing.  

But this situation is unexpected.  I hadn't anticipated being forced to suggest the way to productively spend the next week, so I need some time to think about it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, you are trying to get my attention.  
MR. WEYL:
No, Mr. President.  I am sorry, but I wanted to throw in some humour and say that we might have a break, or a breather, as we waited for translation of the Rule 66 motion -- 

To end the anecdote, I think there might be a problem with Baghel because Mr. Webster said he would perhaps have him in examination-in-chief for two hours but that he does not know exactly how long he needs to reserve for that purpose so as to determine the time of the cross-examination.  But if we do not know how long the examination-in-chief is to take, we certainly do not know how long the cross-examinations will take.  And I do not want to start not knowing whether I can conclude, and given that Mr. Baghel should not have any interaction with members of the Prosecution from the time he starts his testimony.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  What we do now, we adjourn now -- 
MS. KOUO:
All rise. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no.  I do apologise.  
MS. KOUO:
I'm sorry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That -- that should not have come over the system. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I mean, I hesitate to -- to the end the -- the good humour at the -- but it's clear that, if the Defence is going to have an objection to Mr. Baghel being in contact with the members of this team while he's testifying, his testimony is not practicable because I don't think it can be completed within four and a half days, as a practical matter.  When I suggested two hours, I was really being sort of tongue-in-cheek because I know that that can't possibly happen because there are going to be objections to exhibits that are going in.  So -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, have you served on the Defence the outlined of Mr. Baghel's testimony?  Are there -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
(Microphones overlapping)...I believe his testimony is summarised in the pre-trial brief.  There's a -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I know -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
-- yeah. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- I'm not talking about his summary now.  Do they know what exhibits are going to be tendered through him?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Not in a itemised fashion.  We have 280 tabs in the binders that were disclosed on all of the parties, and -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but is Mr. Baghel intended to tender all of those matters? 
MR. WEBSTER:
No.  But we don't -- we do not have an itemised list of what -- what exhibits can be tendered through him.  So that's something that we would have two work on before -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you -- you don't know -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, it's very difficult to interpret an exchange between two speakers. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry.  

How long would it take to prepare that list?  Because there's no way of assessing what legal objections will be taken until you have identified the exhibits that will be tendered through him.  And -- and how long an exercise would that be? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I think that's a project of a weekend.  I think that's a project of a few days.  It's not something that I could do -- I mean, I'm simply trying to give candid responses to the Court's question -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  I know.  I -- I appreciate that -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yeah -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- but if I'm not happy about the -- the -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
The answer. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- the answer, that doesn't mean I am -- I'm comfortable about your candor.  I mean, there's nothing wrong with being candid, but I would have thought that you would have been more ready with Mr. Baghel, as we have been discussing him in this sort of capacity since the last trial session. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yeah. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'd like to make a few comments about Mr. Baghel's testimony.  I think I know what the problems are, and I'd like to inform you of them.  

First of all, you'll have a motion to exclude his testimony for violations of the disclosure rules.  You'll probably deny it, but the fact is that the Prosecution has failed to comply with the disclosure rules concerning Mr. Baghel's testimony.  Specifically, he's intended to testify to the obtaining by the Prosecutor of various documents from various agencies in Rwanda, the Rwandan government.  I've been asking, for I think over a year now, for the receipts and the chain-of-custody records, showing where those documents came from, on what date they were given, who provided them, all these things that are necessity to the foundation for the exhibits that they want to offer through him.  And the Prosecution has never given me even one single receipt.  So I don't think we're in any position to hear this witness's testimony until they comply with the Rule 66(B) material that is needed to evaluate the substance of his testimony.  

And we can hear my motion.  I could make it in writing or I could make it orally, but I think that's the first step as to whether or not Mr. Baghel can begin his testimony, as a legal issue, without the proper disclosure.  To me, it only makes sense that the -- to have a witness come and say, "Yes, this exhibit can be admitted because we got it from the ministry of information in Rwanda," without producing the underlying documents showing the transfer between the ministry and the OTP, it seems incongruous that such testimony -- oral testimony could be given without disclosure of the underlying records. 

Secondly, I think it's a -- a very bad idea to call Mr. Baghel as a witness in the case until the very end of the Prosecution's case.  It's not for me to tell them what order to call their witnesses in, but most of these exhibits will come in based on testimony of witnesses with some firsthand knowledge of the information, as almost 50 speeches have already come in as Defence exhibits from the -- from the binders.  So in the course of the trial, most of the Prosecution's exhibits, I believe, will be admitted with witnesses who have knowledge of -- of it.  And it will only be for Mr. Baghel at that -- at the end of the trial to clean up in -- exhibits which the Prosecution wants to offer without a witness.  And I think at that time his testimony will be a lot shorter, would be a lot less contentious.  And so, to me, it makes more sense that he be called at the end of the case, and then -- if he's called now, we're going to be fighting over exhibits for which other witnesses can probably lay a sufficient foundation for their admission.  So I offer that as a suggestion.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Madam Registrar, don't react too quickly this time.  We are -- we are coming up to the time where we are going to take the adjournment until Monday.  

In terms of Monday, Mr. Webster, we think it will be useful if you did the exercise you said you could do with regard to identifying what exhibits are going -- are intended to be tendered through Mr. Baghel.  On Monday we can decide whether it makes sense to continue with his testimony, but we think that the preliminary step would be identifying the material that he would be exhibiting and seeing what, if any, legal issues arise on them.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I have no problem with looking into the matter and coming back with a recommendation.  But having heard Mr. Robinson's comments just a moment ago, and reflecting on the discussions that we've had on this issue before, I'm not very optimistic about moving forward with -- with Baghel.  And I'm just saying that to be quite up front.  

Mr. Baghel was anticipated as our first witness for the very reason that we wanted to put in a maximum number of exhibits, which we assumed would go in on a consensual basis, that we'd simply lay the foundation for them and that there would be some consent involved.  As it turns out, that was problematic.  It was problematic mainly because of the opposition we anticipated from the Defence.  And, again, as it turns out, many of those exhibits were brought in as Defence exhibits anyway, without any concern about where they came from or how they came into our possession.  So that's the situation we're confronting.  

We've tried to -- to encourage a smooth administration -- trial administration with a view to having the exhibits come in initially.  That wasn't workable, and I don't think it's any more workable now, quite frankly.  I think the only reason that Mr. Baghel is an option is because we have no other witness to go forward with.  To me, it doesn't seem like the best way to approach moving forward, given the problems that we are likely to encounter with the evidentiary objections.  

But I will go over it this weekend.  I will come back with a suggestion on Monday.  And if -- if the issue of Mr. Baghel doesn't seem practicable, I will have other suggestions for what we can do profitably       as -- as a Chamber in order to move forward. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We -- we don't necessarily need anybody to invent unnecessary work to do. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, it seems I've had that quite a bit over the last six months -- 

MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)...so it's -- but at the -- but, nonetheless, we will adjourn until Monday    and -- and decide how to proceed next week. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I see Mr. Robinson rising to his feet.  Maybe I can anticipate his comment because I would assume that, by now, we would have had a request for an updated medical report on Joseph Serugendo.  So if we're on the same wavelength, which I think we are, that is an issue that the Court can address. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We will be looking into that, and hopefully by Monday we -- we have something to say on that.  

Mr. Weyl, this is probably a good note on which to adjourn, consensus between Webster and Robinson.  And I hope that carries forward into the rest of the trial.  
(Court adjourned at 1601H)
