MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you.

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding; Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session, today, Tuesday, the 2nd of  March 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the 
Prosecutor versus Karemera, et al., Case No. ICTR-00-98-44-T. 

Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

The appearances are the same. 
MR. NIMY: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  I simply wish to mention the presence of an intern within our team.  Her name is Miss Belinda McRae, R-A-E.  
and she's from Australia.  Yes.  She's rising to be seen by the Judges.  I just did that introduction.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I hope you have a successful tour of duty.

Good morning, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  Your Honours, good morning.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your testimony will continue.  I remind you that you remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your evidence begun.  And Mr. Nimy will continue his examination.  
MR. NIMY: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
ELIEZER NIYITEGEKA, 
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued) 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, good morning.
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	Well, we will continue with our exercise.  And if I'm not mistaken, yesterday we stopped shortly before moving on to the interview you granted Radio Rwanda on the 28th of April 1994.

Do you recall having granted an interview on that date?  
A.	Yes, I do, Counsel. 
Q.	And was it still about further clarifications that the interim government was supposed to provide concerning its work, its concerns, and preoccupations given the situation that prevailed at the time?
A.	As a matter of fact, that interview dealt with the appointments, particularly after the meeting of cabinet and the appointment of administration sous-préfets where they failed in their duties.  And so the journalist interrupted me.  And this was late in the afternoon towards 6 p.m.  

And he asked me exactly -- sort of a summary of what cropped up from the meeting that we had.  And we even had the same type of meeting the day before.  That was on the 27th.  And so I tried to give him a brief summary of the work that was done by the cabinet or government.  And that was when I did that interview.  
Q.	And what was the motivation that prompted government to appoint the new sous-préfets?  Yes.  Sous-préfets.
A.	There were some sous-préfectures that did not have sous-préfets in office, and there were some headquarters of préfectures where there was no assistance, that is, no sous-préfet.  And so government's concern was to restore stability and calm nationwide.  

And so government intended to endow officials of préfets -- préfectures with the staff that they needed.  The préfets needed sous-préfets to help them in restoring stability in their various préfectures or in the sous-préfectures where there was no sous-préfet.

Some had died it must be said; others had either fled or had deserted their offices.  And so there were these vacancies of offices of sous-préfets.  And so the council of ministers or the cabinet found it necessary to fill these vacancies. 
MR. NIMY: 
Now, Mr. Issa, can you help me by handing to Mr. Niyitegeka Exhibit Number 7 on my list of documents.  It is the Radio Rwanda interview of Niyitegeka, 28th of April 1994.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Yes.  Do you have the document, Mr. Niyitegeka?
A.	Yes, I do, Counsel. 
Q.	So I will ask you to take the last paragraph or the last sentence on page 25 and the first subparagraph of page 26.  Are you there? 
A.	Yes, I am. 
Q.	Can you read that to us, Mr. Niyitegeka.
A.	It begins with "Hari".  Now, that is a question put to me by the journalist:  
	"Mr. Minister of Information, there is another question that is in the mind of citizens actually concerning the assurance that people are supposed to have and the final arrest of -- putting an end to the troubles and massacres which followed the death of his excellency, the president of the republic.  Where exactly is government with this programme?" 

And the answer given by the minister, "From the reports that have reached us, progressively this programme is being put in place, and we are telling the people that there is no cause to kill one another.  In areas which we have visited, we have noticed that the people understand what is happening.  And furthermore, préfets and bourgmestres are helping us to achieve this aim.  And that is why we have decided to appoint new sous-préfets, so that they can assist the préfets.  They can lend a hand to government and help us stamp out this tragedy which is tarnishing the image of Rwanda.

"No Rwandan should assault another Rwandan.  Nobody should be a victim of assaults or none should be killed because of his ethnicity.  Nobody should be assaulted or killed because of the region from which he hails.  May this be stopped once and for all.  The authorities or the offices in charge of law and order should make sure that if they find anyone engaged in any such activities, if they catch someone engaged in looting, if the authorities of law and order arrest anyone aggressing or assaulting anybody, the authorities should not hesitate -- they should not be afraid -- of punishing -- of meting out exemplary punishment on any such culprit."  That is it.  
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, and does that answer to the journalist's question mean to you that there was any form of incitation for the Tutsis to be eliminated? 
A.	But, Counsel, it is clearly written here.  Anyone can answer that question.  There is no word anywhere calling for any aggression against the Tutsis.  As a matter of fact, it is the contrary because the text is asking the authorities to do the best in their power to stop those criminal acts and violence against people who were victims because of their original or ethnic origins. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I would like to pray you to have this document admitted into evidence.  But when I consider your comments with regard to the quantity of documents that have already been tendered and when I also consider the fact that the answer of the witness is found in the minutes, I am wondering if the Chamber may accept merely the minutes or whether I should apply for this document to be admitted into evidence as well.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Nimy.  We think the information is already on the record.  It is in the transcript, and it is already part of the trial.  So it is not necessary to admit the document at this stage.  
MR. NIMY: 
As it pleases the Court, Your Honour.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, so I am now at the last interview which you granted Radio Rwanda on the 
	17th to 18th of June 1994.  Firstly, do you confirm that was the case? 
A.	Yes, I do.  I remember. 
Q.	Could you tell the Trial Chamber in brief what this interview was about.
A.	I recall that I granted that interview on the morning of June the 18th to the 6 a.m. newscast on Radio Rwanda.  So I was briefing them about all the report on the meeting that had been held on the 18th of June 1994. 
Q.	And during that report, did it have anything to do with the appointment of bourgmestres? 
A.	You had the appointment of bourgmestres of some communes, of one préfet, the préfet of Butare. 
Q.	Naturally, were you also talking about the appointment of Mr. Kajelijeli, the bourgmestre of the Mukingo commune? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  I believe that Kajelijeli was one of the bourgmestres who had been appointed by the cabinet meeting of the 17th of June 1994. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. Issa, would you kindly hand over to the witness document number 10 in my bundle of documents.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Do you have the document, Mr. Niyitegeka?
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	So please go to page 16, the first paragraph where you have a certain number of names with regard to the office to which they had been appointed by government.  I can see in the 
	Gitarama-Nyakabanda commune, Mr. Nsabimana; Nyabikenke commune, Musabyimana; in another commune, Musambira commune, Karani, Dominic; Masango commune, Mwanafunzi, Anthère.

Are you there?  And it goes on.  And at the end I see Mr. Kajelijeli, Juvénal, Mukingo commune.  Can you see it?  Is that the decision of the cabinet?
A.	Yes, it is, indeed. 
Q.	Was Nzirorera part of that cabinet meeting or that conseiller?  So was Nzirorera part of that cabinet?
A.	Nzirorera was not a minister and could not attend a cabinet meeting. 
Q.	Did Nzirorera have any role whatsoever to play to influence the decision of the cabinet in that regard? 
A.	I can't say because the cabinet meeting appointed the bourgmestres based on a proposal made by the minister of rural and communal development -- of the interior and communal development.  

So it is that minister who proposed the names of bourgmestres.  Whether Nzirorera approached the minister is something I cannot tell.  But the fact is that Nzirorera could not attend a cabinet meeting because he was not a minister.  
Q.	Very well, Mr. Niyitegeka.  Mr. Niyitegeka, let me quickly deal with you based on the documents that have already been admitted into evidence before this Chamber.  

The concern -- what were your concerns as a member of the interim government after the tragedy of the 6th of April and which are a translation of the seriousness with which the government was managing the affairs given the circumstances?

Firstly, you have this -- 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. Issa, D. NZ293.  Could you please take out D. NZ293 of 9 April 1994.  It is a speech.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Do you have the document, Mr. Niyitegeka? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	So I will ask you to just briefly peruse it to refresh your memory as the document has already been admitted into evidence.  And here as well, Mr. Niyitegeka -- was the idea here to call on the people not to kill each other and to stop the killings?  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  For example, I can -- let me just read a statement that I've taken just by chance:  
	"When the people turn against each other, it cannot solve their problem.  That leads to more problems in the country.  Massacres should not be avenged by other massacres."  

That is the reason why the cabinet meeting asked that what is referred to as a stop to the killings -- more specifically, the cabinet is calling on the armed forces not to open fire on people if that is not necessary.  And this is something that I just picked out like that inside this text. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Niyitegeka.  According to the interim government's policy, what was your approach in principle against the people who were committing these disruptions?  Was this impunity or sanctions?  What is it you did? 
A.	I believe that we saw that yesterday.  The cabinet meeting asked the minister of justice and the minister of defence to take action against troublemakers and people who perpetrated violence. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. Issa, once more could you kindly assist me by presenting document number P. 194 to the witness, P. 194.  It is a letter that was sent to the minister of the interior on the 30th of June 1994.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, do you have the document now? 
A.	Yes, I do, Counsel. 
Q.	Do you remember it? 
A.	It is a copy of the letter which I sent to the minister of the interior and communal development.  I wrote it myself. 
Q.	And in that letter you indeed ask for sanctions against a senior staff who had been guilty of 
	offensive acts.  Do you confirm it to the Trial Chamber?
A.	I do, and I denounce the poor management of the Gisovu commune where one Ndimbati was a bourgmestre at the time.  And he had been involved in looting and embezzlement of funds, money -- people's money which had been banked in the Banque Populaire.  And those people had disappeared or had been murdered.  And the bourgmestre had been found to be guilty of having syphoned the funds which they had kept in the local bank, that is, the Banque Populaire.

So I was asking the minister of the interior -- and I copied the prime minister and the préfet of the Kibuye préfecture -- to take appropriate measures to mete out sanctions to the bourgmestre in question.  
Q.	Very well.  Mr. Niyitegeka, after having overviewed the nature of the interim government -- its concerns, its actions, and its appeals to the people, I'm going to put a series of questions to you to which you can answer very briefly.

Mr. Niyitegeka, were the leaders of the MRND in a position to exercise any form of control on the people referred to as Interahamwe after the 6th of April 1994?
A.	It is difficult to give a brief answer to that question because, firstly, I would have to explain how the Interahamwe -- what is referred to as "Interahamwe" was structured.  What was the Interahamwe. In my understanding, as far as I knew, some people say that it was the youth wing of the MRND.  But I would like to inform you that the MRND was not solely the youth wing of the MRND.  Yesterday I believe I told you -- maybe yesterday or on Thursday -- I told you that the Interahamwe, somebody like Nkezabera who was in his 40s, my age, somebody like George, who was beyond his 40s cannot be described as being youth.  So you cannot say that they were the youth wing of the MRND.

Furthermore, you didn't have any fabric attributed to the MRND; that is, wearing a fabric did not make you part of the MRND -- the Interahamwe.  I have to tell the Chamber that these pieces of cloth had been imported in 1990 before multipartyism, and anybody could have bought them, including the RPF could have bought it in order to easily infiltrate.

I say this because I'm a witness.  RPF infiltrators were the first people to buy that piece of cloth which was sold by Eliab Ndamage, who was a Gitarama trader whom I knew very well, or his son, Thaddée, were the people who had imported those pieces of clothes.  So anybody, even I myself, could have bought it.  Mathieu could have bought it and said he was Interahamwe.  I would say the same thing at their age.  But Interahamwe was not a youth wing as such.  Since you could have infiltrators, I couldn't say that Mathieu Nzirorera or Karemera could control those Interahamwe because they did not know them.  You have people, infiltrators, whom they themself could not recognise.

So to say that they could have total control on what was happening, that organisation -- total control on that organisation which was not structured.  They did not have any status to become an Interahamwe member.  You did not have to apply formally for membership.  Anybody could have declared themself to be an Interahamwe member.  It was difficult to have any form of control over them.

Maybe you can say they controlled, but I can say so because I know they could not control them totally because they did not know them all.  In brief, that would be my answer. 
Q.	Thank you.  And you accompanied Prime Minister Kambanda to Butare; is that correct? 
A.	Who are you talking about?  
Q.	PM Kambanda -- did you accompany him when he went to Butare after the 6th of April? 
A.	But Butare is his hometown.  He went there often.  So I don't know what -- 
Q.	No.  I'm saying when he went there specifically in his capacity as prime minister.  
A.	Counsel, he used to go to Butare.  After his appointment as PM, he would go there in his capacity as prime minister. 
Q.	Let me give you more detail.  When he took the floor and told the people -- spoke to the people of Butare, did he express regrets to the fact that the people were inactive?
A.	I don't recall. 
Q.	Did he appeal to the people, as far as you can remember, to kill the Tutsis? 
A.	I never heard him making such a speech. 
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, as a matter of fact, did he do so? 
A.	No, because when you look at the speech that he made on the 3rd of May in Kibuye, there he was -- it was -- when you look at the speech that he made calling people to leave the internally displaced people in peace, those who had gone to Bisesero, the Bisesero hill, Kambanda could not have made that type of speech calling people to massacre the Tutsis. 
Q.	Very well.  Since you are talking about the month of May, Mr. Niyitegeka, on the 13th of May, were you on the Muhira hill to take part in attacks against Tutsis? 
A.	Counsel, whether it was the 13th of May or any other day, I never went to Bisesero or to the Muhira commune to chase Tutsis.  I never went to that area.  On the 13th of May, to be more specific, I was in a cabinet meeting.  And I have tendered evidence to support that.  You have many items, especially the diary of former PM Kambanda which had been seized by the Prosecution which was not disclosed to me during my trial.

Subsequently, I saw that diary that confirmed that there was a cabinet meeting.  And on that same day I also held a press conference with the BBC journalists.  And there is a video recording of that press conference.  All those pieces of evidence are available.  This is documentary evidence.  People who claim that I went to Bisesero on the 13th of May have no documentary evidence to prove it because, in effect, I did not go there, and I had no reason to go there.

A minister of information, a spokesperson of the government, on the very day that a cabinet meeting was being held to be absent from a cabinet meeting to go to Bisesero, which is 150 kilometres from where the cabinet meeting was being held -- that is absurd.  People who say so -- I don't know what to say about them.  And as a matter of fact, it's an unfortunate thing that the Judges concluded that that person was credible. 
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, were there ever any meetings held in Kibuye in June 1994? 
A.	What date are you referring to, Counsel?  Can you be more precise. 
Q.	I am talking about June 1994 without any specific date.  
A.	But there could have been meetings without me participating at those meetings.  There could have been meetings held at Kibuye. 
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, I'm saying, to the best of your knowledge, are you aware of the fact that some meetings took place in June 1994 there at Kibuye?
A.	What I know is that there was a meeting bringing together magistrates or the supreme council of magistrates which took place on a date which I really cannot recall but there at Kibuye.  This meeting was chaired by the minister of justice, Madam Agnès Ntamabyaliro.  So I know that there was such a meeting in June in Kibuye.  The supreme magistrature met and to elect the president of the 
	supreme council and the other top magistrates. 
Q.	Well and good.  So, Mr. Niyitegeka, we close by some facts that were admitted in your trial and which the Prosecutor brought here to this trial.  And of course, they are regarding a joint criminal enterprise.  And since these facts, though admitted, can still be contested, I am going to ask you a number of questions on these facts by giving you the references of these facts.

First of all, there's fact number 10 whereby on the 28th of June 1994 close to the 
technical teachers training school on a highway you ordered Interahamwes to undress the 
body of a lady who had been shot to death, to get a piece of wood, to shape it into a pointed object, 
and to thrust it into her vagina.

What do you have to say about that, Mr. Niyitegeka?  Very quickly.
A.	Counsel, I do not understand how I can make any comment on such a statement before such a huge assembly made up of men and women and who hear such slanderous, abusive language which, unfortunately, were accepted by the Judges as grounded, having some grounds.

Can you imagine the Judges in the decision of 20th of November 2000, that the Trial Chamber asked the Prosecutor to give the name of the victim, the identity of the victim.  But until this date the Prosecutor has not been able to give the name of the victim in question until the moment I am speaking.  That decision was rendered by the Trial Chamber which was handling my case on the 20th of November 19- -- no.  I'm sorry.  The 20th of November in the year 2000.

And if I recall very well, it was on paragraph 46.  Until today the Prosecutor has been unable to provide with the necessary precision the identity of the victim.  But unfortunately, these lies have come recurrently before the Trial Chamber, and they are banded here and there before the public.  It's unfortunate.  But again -- it shows again -- it reveals again the image of the Tribunal.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Niyitegeka.  Your answer also covers facts admitted under number 11 and under number 12.  I will take the charge admitted on number -- in 1999 on the 13th of May between 
	7 a.m. and 10 a.m.  As leader, you participated in a wide-scale attack launched by armed assailants against Tutsis who had taken refuge on the Muhira hill.
A.	Counsel, I said it again.  On the 13th of May I was in Murambi in Gitarama préfecture.  And on the same day I had a cabinet meeting.  But more precisely, at 8 a.m. I -- the prime minister granted me audience, and it is carried in his diary which the Prosecutor had confiscated.  

On the 13th of May it is written there clearly that at 8 a.m. I had an appointment with the prime minister in Murambi.  I was with the prime minister.  It is written there in the diary of the prime minister, the diary which has been confiscated by the Prosecutor.  

On that same 13th of May I could not have been in Gitarama and Murambi and at the same time in Muhira, which was 150 kilometres away from the other.  I am not ubiquitous.  I could not be in 
two places at the same time.  But again, the Tribunal believed it.  It's unfortunate.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Niyitegeka.  The charges under 100 and 101 are also covered by the answers which you just gave.  And in 102 it is stated that on the 13th of May 1994 in the evening you are alleged to have held a meeting in Kucyapa, but it is also related to the other charges, facts which you answered by saying that you were at a cabinet meeting.   

On the morning of 4th May -- we are on 105 -- you and others accompanied by assailants -- you arrived on Muhira hill where you parked your cars.  And here I wish to note that the answers which you gave which have to do with your -- 
A.	No.  Please.  The morning of what date?  
Q.	The 14th of May.
A.	But on 14th May I wish to recall and remind you that the Trial Chamber acquitted me of that allegation, that charge -- no.  Rather, the Appeal Chamber acquitted me in its decision of 9th July 2004. 
Q.	Very well.  119 -- in 119 you are reproached of three meetings held on 19th of April 1994 and the 
	first held towards the 10th of June in the conference hall of the préfectoral office.  You attended that meeting with Interahamwe Kayishema, Ruzindana.  Ruzindana took the floor.  Hategekimana also took the floor.  He distributed weapons, and you promised to provide weapons to kill Tutsis in Bisesero.  

What do you have to say about that? 
A.	Counsel, on the 10th of June 1994, I was in a cabinet meeting in Muramba.  Muramba is in the Gisenyi préfecture located 180 kilometres from Kibuye.  And the report of that cabinet meeting is found in cassette number 140 of Radio Rwanda and is in the keeping of the Prosecutor, number 140 in the cassettes of the Prosecutor.  I could not have been in Muramba 180 kilometres away and be at the same time leading a meeting in Kibuye.

Furthermore, Counsel, please remember the witness who said this is Witness GGV and who says he was accompanied and that he was supposed to have gone there in the company of two Interahamwe friends, Omar and Hashim.

Those two friends made certified statements.  The Tribunal has those statements.  They were admitted in evidence in this trial.  And the two friends, the two companions of the witness who went with him said that the same witness who passes for a witness of that meeting could not have gone to a meeting as such made up of Interahamwes because he could not survive.

He was a Tutsi.  He was instead protected by his companions who were hiding him, and he could not have gone to any such meeting.  Just to say that he was a witness of -- you're saying he was a witness of a meeting which did not take place and which he personally did not attend.  And it is his companions who say so which confirms the fact that they were not at that meeting.  All this simply to tarnish my image and to tarnish the image of the Tribunal which rendered such a judgement.  It's unfortunate. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Niyitegeka, did you attend any meetings which took place in Kibuye on the 
	17th of June 1994? 
A.	In like manner, the meeting of 17th June, such as the attack of 18th June and the meeting of 18th June which took place after that attack at Kiziba -- all these are statements made by one witness, one unique witness.  On the 18th we were at a cabinet meeting, and we talked about the appointment of bourgmestre and particularly Kajelijeli as bourgmestre.  He was appointed on the 17th of June.

I reported his appointment because I was there at that meeting.  I could not have been at Muramba in a meeting of -- cabinet meeting and at the same time be attending a meeting in Kibuye with Interahamwes.  And what is more, Niyitegeka was a member of the MDR party, an opposition party.  How could Niyitegeka have gone to lead a meeting of Interahamwe?  In what capacity?

If in fact the Interahamwe were a wing of the MRND, how would Niyitegeka go and lead an MRND party meeting when he was an MRD member?  Not just any -- not any wing but a 
political bureau.  I never attended any meeting of the MRND.  And so I could not by any means and, what is more, lead or chair a meeting of the Interahamwe which is a wing of the MRND. 
Q.	Well and good.  Lastly, Mr. Niyitegeka, in one word, just in one word, did you ever hear of the civil defence programme?
A.	Yes.  In one word, yes. 
Q.	And what was it all about?  What did this programme mean? 
A.	To be precise, I need to look at the text which governed the civil defence because there was a text to that effect, a text which spelt out what it consisted of and its aims. 
Q.	And maybe let's proceed by exclusion.  Mr. Niyitegeka, please, the civil defence programme -- was it conceived for the extermination of Tutsis? 
A.	Never.  Never at all.  That is not true. 
Q.	The civil defence programme -- was it conceived as an additional means of fighting the RPF?
A.	Yes.  That is true. 
Q.	And lastly, Witness, when you answered me a few minutes ago concerning Prime Minister Kambanda, concerning Butare, and his statements, did I get you right when you said that he never incited people to eliminate Tutsis? 
A.	That I confirm.  He never made any such statements. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Niyitegeka.  I thank you.
A.	Thank you.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I just finished my examination-in-chief.  We began at 9:30, and I have been on for 
	47 minutes.  I promised 45 minutes.  I used 47.  I beg you to forgive me for the 2 additional minutes which are due to the slowing down in my breath between two questions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, rather than forgive you, I congratulate you.  
MR. NIMY: 
Wow.  What an honour, Mr. President.  I thank you very much.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Before we, perhaps, go on to the next thing, I'm going to go counter to the recommendation I made yesterday because I had also suggested to Mr. Nimy that he not admit documents where the 
	witness's answer was complete.  But with respect to his document number 10 which is not yet in evidence, I think it would be helpful to have it on the record because it is the text of the interim government resolution concerning the appointment of Kajelijeli and it's an issue in the trial.  

It's only three pages, and he has it in the Kinyarwanda original and the French translation.  So I think that should be admitted if Mr. Nimy agrees.  
MR. NIMY: 
But, Mr. President, I prefer to stand by the decision which you took following the suggestion you made to me at the same time.  The records are there, and that is my stance.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Well, I will move it into admission when I do my cross-examination, but I'll wait to hear if there are any other Defence teams that plan to examine the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do any of the other Defence teams wish to examine this witness?  The answer is no.  Thank you.

Mr. Witness, you now have to respond to the Prosecutor who will have an opportunity to cross-examine you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Good morning, Your Honours.  

And good morning to you, Mr. Niyitegeka, and to everyone.

Mr. Issa, could you assist me, please.  I have some documents that I've copied already, and if you could distribute them to the parties on the other side and to the Chamber. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Niyitegeka, during your examination-in-chief, you disputed the term "Hutu power".  But surely you can agree that there was a split in the MDR party and that you supported the Karamira/Murego tendency or wing of the MDR party.  Isn't that so?
A.	Counsel, I said Karamira was second vice-president of the party, and Murego was the secretary of the party, and so that is for one.  What was the other section?  What -- how many sections or how many factions did you talk about within the MRND?  Because each one puts it the way he wants it.  Tomorrow you will say here that I too had any own faction.  
Q.	No, Mr. Niyitegeka.  I don't think I would claim that there were several different factions.  I think the literature on the period 1993 and 1994 and most of the trials that have gone forward in this Tribunal have addressed the issue of a split into two parts of the MDR party.

So perhaps you can make subtle distinctions, but you must agree that historically that's accurate.  There was a split in the party, and there was a party -- a faction or a wing that was identified with Karamira and Murego.  And the other side we can say was identified with Uwilingiyimana and Twagiramungu.  Don't you agree to that simple proposition?
A.	The way you are putting things is not correct, and why do you put the first vice-president, Nsengiyaremye?  Why is he in all this, Counsel?  
Q.	Certainly you would agree that in your trial, in your own trial, witness after witness testified about a Hutu Power wing in the MDR and identified you with that wing.  So at least as far as the testimony in your own trial goes, wasn't that the evidence that was forthcoming?  You may not agree with it, but wasn't that the evidence that the Court heard?
A.	Can you refresh my mind by citing the evidence, please.  
(Pages 1 to 13 by Kelly Surina)






























1030H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	No, I can't.  I'm asking you to draw upon your own recollection of your trial.  Didn't witness after witness talk about a Hutu Power wing and associate you with that wing?  I'm not suggesting that you agree with their testimony, but that was the testimony in your trial.  

Mr. Witness, what are you going to consult? 
A.	I am consulting my judgement, Counsel, because I would like to see what the Trial Chamber came up with as a ruling concerning what you are saying.  
Q.	To help you, why don't we turn to paragraph 357 in the Trial Chamber I judgement of the 
16th of May 2004.  And I assume you have it in French.  Let me read the first sentence in English.  

"There is insufficient evidence to enable the Chamber to make findings on the politics and ideologies followed by the various groups and individuals in Rwanda at the material time, or on the internal politics of the MDR Party in particular."  

So that's not quite what you said yesterday.  The Chamber didn't make findings of fact because it did not have enough evidence or expertise to do so, but clearly this was an issue in your trial as acknowledged by the Chamber in paragraph 357.  Right? 
A.	Counsel, you asked me to read that paragraph and from that paragraph it is clear.  The Prosecutor did not file an appeal against that conclusion.  I do not see then why you are revisiting the issue, except you want to make the most of it again because as -- as it says, there was insufficient evidence, as you read.  

You want to use this trial to go back to what you -- you did not do at the time?  You did not appeal against that, did you? 

I explained to my mind -- in my conception, in our party, we all -- we always had one party president and that was Twagiramungu.  At a certain time we suspended him; it was a disciplinary sanction.  
But later we lifted that sanction and we still recognised him as our president.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I see the time.  I can continue, but perhaps the Chamber would like to take a break.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  This is the time for our mid-morning recess and we take our morning recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1030H to 1103H)  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So Mr. Niyitegeka, getting back to the issue of the split in the MDR party, I understand that you resist the term of Hutu Power, but can we agree that you personally did not support the tendency within the party that was identified with Agathe Uwilingiyimana and Faustin Twagiramungu? 
A.	Well, it is true that there were some persons -- members of the party who were sanctioned.  I am not one of those who was penalised for having flouted the principles of the party.  
Q.	That doesn't answer my question.  So I can repeat the question for you or you can think again and give us an answer that's responsive.  
A.	Counsel, I referred you to a decision -- to a factual decision of the Trial Chamber in my trial, and as we agreed, there was no appeal against that finding or that ruling, and I think it is inadmissible that you use this forum to redeem your case.  

Hutu Power did not exist within our party.  The MDR party (sic) did not exist in our party.  
The Hutu party -- the Hutu Power, above everything, I did not know it.  So in short, there were a number of people -- members of the party and -- that exists.  Take, for example, what's happening in France within the -- within the UMP.  People talk about the Villepinists, people talk about Sarkozists, but that does not mean that there's a schism within the party as such.  The Villepinists remain Villepinists, and the Sarkozists remain Sarkozists. 

But in all, I never was a friend to Murego, I was never a friend to Karamira, and I never belonged to any trend because it was led by the one or the other of these two persons or these senior-ranking officials.  
Q.	Can we agree that the split within the MDR started to emerge or started to become an issue of public discourse around the same time that your party congress was organised in July of 1993?  That was the instance when there was open dissension or a very public split or disagreement within the party.  Can we agree on that much? 
A.	Can we also agree that Madam Agathe Uwilingiyimana attended that same congress, at least on the meeting of the 23rd of July?  She attended that congress until the meeting was adjourned.  Now -- so to say she belonged to a trend (inaudible) that did not attend the congress is unfair.  It's -- it's inaccurate, it's not correct. 
Q.	Well, we'll move on because obviously you have a very set position on this issue and I can't pretend 
to convince you otherwise, but the record will speak for itself.  But in any case, the tensions within the MDR party became particularly contentious after President Habyarimana appointed 
Faustin Twagiramungu as the prime minister designate under the Arusha Accords.  Isn't that so?  
This was in August of 1993.  
A.	Well, that's true and it was even shortly before that.  That was before, shortly before that because he was appointed, if I do -- if I do recall right, he was appointed -- yes, if I don't -- if I'm not mistaken, it was on the 25th of June 1993 because Twagiramungu proposed himself as the candidate -- party candidate of the party to the interim government, the prime minister's office.  

The MDR party, especially the political bureau, did not appreciate that procedure.  The party neither appreciated the decision or -- made by the president of the republic, Juvénal Habyarimana, who accepted this candidature because it was filed without going through the proper channels, namely, the political bureau.  

We wrote to the president of the republic to contest that appointment, and I'm referring to the 
political bureau.  It was not Karamira, neither was it Murego.  And that is why I asked you where do you place Nsengiyaremye, Dismas because he was the first vice-president.  And so in the absence of Twagiramungu who was president, it was Dismas Nsengiyaremye who was supposed to replace him immediately.  

We wrote -- no, I think I should explain this to you.  We wrote and we did not stop at writing, we went on to submit a petition at the court demanding the dismissal of Twagiramungu from the (inaudible) of the party.  And the court gave a favourable answer -- ruled in our favour.  But as I said, at a certain point in time we noticed that it was not in the interest of the party and so we preferred to calm things.  When I say "we", I'm referring to the political bureau; we preferred to make peace.  And so, in short, you do not need to dramatise things.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you for that exposé.  Then we can both agree that it's a very complicated story.  It involved a number of political personalities, and that to master the whole chapter about -- that concerns this split would take quite some time and background reading for those of us who are not familiar with the political terrain of Rwanda.  

But we can agree on one thing, and this is just to come back to basics, Mr. Niyitegeka, and it's that the designation of Faustin Twagiramungu as the prime minister designate under the Arusha Accords generated a great deal of controversy within your party.  That we -- we can agree on that.  I believe you said so already.  That's simply to summarise what you've just told us.  Correct? 
A.	You want me to repeat what I said a few minutes ago? 
Q.	No.  I don't think we need to hear the explanation again; it's already on the trial record.  But I'm simply bringing us back to the basic proposition, which you should be able to agree, which is that President Habyarimana's designation or appointment of Faustin Twagiramungu as the prime minister designate, the prime minister who would head the broad-based transitional government that was anticipated by the Arusha Accords, that specific appointment caused a great deal of dissension within the MDR.  In fact, you've already said that, but I -- I'm simply trying to get clarification from you so that it's clear on the record.  
A.	Well, all of this was in the interests of President Habyarimana because he was the president of the party in power and he appointed Twagiramungu as prime minister without the consent of the political bureau.  He knew that that was going to cause dissension and that was going to be in the interests of the (inaudible) that there should be division, schisms within MDR party which was in opposition.  

This was in the interests of the party in power, that is, the MRND.  They opposed the -- the -- the adverse party, so it was an issue of political rivalry, only political rivalry.  
Q.	Well, I thank you for that response because that's the very point I was trying to get to, which is that this was a political manoeuvre by Habyarimana on behalf of the MRND to weaken the MDR.  And you've summed it up quite -- quite nicely.  
A.	Exactly.  President Habyarimana contacted Twagiramungu.  Now things should be clear because sometimes it's very often Karamira and Nsengiyaremye -- people who are usually associated to the other party, and yet it is the same Twagiramungu and of course his team which began -- beginning with Agathe Uwilingiyimana who was on the side of -- of President Habyarimana.  
Q.	Yes, Mr. Niyitegeka.  And we can both agree that, ideologically speaking, Habyarimana was much closer to Karamira and Murego than he would ever be to Twagiramungu and Uwilingiyimana.  The reason he appointed Twagiramungu is because he knew that that would split the party further.  
A.	Well, Counsel, that is your opinion.  It is not my opinion.  
Q.	Isn't that consistent with the analysis that you have just given us? 
A.	President Habyarimana had his own reasons for acting in that manner and I cannot interpret his actions, his gestures and so I say it is your opinion and I'm not bound to share it.  
Q.	And then, Mr. Niyitegeka, when we get to the 23rd of October 1993, Froduoald Karamira made a notorious speech in Nyamirambo that was broadcast on the radio.  And at the end of his speech, he uttered the slogan, "Hutu Power, MDR Power, MRND Power" and so on and so forth, and that's when the whole notion of Hutu Power took root.  Can we agree on that much? 
A.	Counsel, you are misrepresenting things.  That is a misrepresentation of the facts.  And it is unfortunate because all this only goes to tarnish the image of this Tribunal -- that tarnishes the image of this Tribunal.  In the sense that you -- you're stating that Karamira's speech was broadcast over the radio and this goes from one trial to the other trial, and it is -- it seems it is common knowledge.  And yet you are not producing any element, any -- no video cassette, no audio cassette of the said speech because I was not working at the radio, but I know -- no, please, no, let me say it before the Judges, that speech never existed.  

Listen --
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)
A.	You too should wait --
Q.	(Microphones overlapping) 
A.	 -- but acknowledge that you said things that were not correct. 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)...statement that it was broadcast on --
A.	(Microphones overlapping)...withdraw your statements.  That's fine, withdraw it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Excuse me.  This is a courtroom.  You both cannot speak at the same time.  So we'll have the process of a question and an answer.  Now -- let's continue now.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Niyitegeka, let me request that you look over to me and if I wave my hand I'm asking you to stop.  And I assure you, you will have an opportunity to give us your views.  I'm not trying to stop you from explaining things.  But there is certain ground that I think we can cover together very easily.  So let me withdraw the portion of my question that implied that this speech was a radio broadcast on the 
23rd of October 1993, and let me just limit it to the fact of the speech itself.  Let's put the issue of how it was broadcast aside.  

So with that qualification, certainly you can agree that it was the slogan that Karamira uttered on the 23rd of October 1993 that led to him being associated with a wing of your party which was dubbed the Hutu Power wing.  Right? 
A.	Counsel, can you be much clearer?  It was broadcast on which radio? 
Q.	I am not talking about a broadcast.  I'm talking about the speech itself in Nyamirambo.  
A.	But you're saying that the speech was broadcast.  It was broadcast where?  I want to be clear because, to my knowledge, no -- that speech -- no speech -- at least Karamira's speech was not broadcast over radio.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, we've gone beyond that and that should be clear to you.  Now I have a certain number of issues that I plan to cover with you and I'm going to cover all of them.  So you've heard my question, you also heard my qualification and my withdrawal -- my reformulation of the question.  So let's set some ground rules right now.  I've asked you a question and I'd like you to answer it.  I think you understand the question.  
A.	But ask your question then.  
Q.	Was it not the slogan that Karamira uttered on the 23rd of October 1993 in his speech in Nyamirambo that led to him being associated with a wing of the party that was dubbed the Hutu Power wing? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I did not attend the Nyamirambo meeting.  I think that should be clear.  I cannot make comments on a speech which was delivered at a location where I was absent.  You've carried out investigations.  Do your investigations again and you'll find out that I never attended that meeting.  So I cannot make comments on a speech that I did not listen to. 
Q.	All right.  I think the record will clearly reflect your response, Mr. Witness.  In any case, let's get back to Froduoald Karamira and Donat Murego.  These were the leaders of your MDR party that arranged for you to be appointed minister of information when the interim government was formed back on the 8th of April 1994; isn't that so? 
A.	Counsel, I was appointed by the MDR political bureau at its meeting that took place on the 30th of December 1993 as minister of information.  I was appointed by the MDR political bureau.  There were two of us initially. There was the outgoing minister who was known as Ndengejeho and myself.  We spent -- or at least -- well, we went to elections and I beat him.  This is true.  This is authentic.  
Q.	Prior to the 8th of April 1994, you had never been appointed a government minister; isn't that so? 
A.	I said I was appointed by the political bureau on the 30th of December 1993 as minister designate.  And if on the 8th of April I was appointed by both personalities, it was with reference to the (inaudible) appointment by the political bureau meeting which took place on the 30th of December 1983 -- 1993.  Just ask my colleagues of the MDR.  Rwamakuba and Bicamumpaka had been appointed by the same political bureau on the same date, that is, the 30th of December 1993.  
Q.	Well, maybe it would be easier to address this issue if we look at a document, Mr. Witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
So if Mr. Issa could assist me.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, to assist the recording, we didn't get the dates and the names to which the witness referred.  So if you could just repeat those for us.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  

Mr. Issa, could you begin by handing this up to the witness.  

This is not the first document as you have it in the bundle.  It's the -- actually the second document, but it's numbered number 1.  The first document doesn't have a number.  And, Your Honours, I'd like to adopt the same procedure I have in the past, which is just to ask Issa -- Mr. Issa to hand the documents directly to the witness because I'm handing him exactly what I've circulated to everyone else.  

If there's a document that the parties and the Chamber does not have that I wish to consult with the witness, then I'll ask Mr. Issa to circulate it so you all see it.  But it would save time if we could just have the registry hand it directly to the witness.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And turning to you, Mr. Niyitegeka, just for the clarity of the record, can you tell us the date that you claim you were appointed minister of interior by the politburo of the MDR and who appointed you?  You gave us a date in December.  Can you repeat that and the name that you mentioned.  
A.	Yes.  In fact, on the 30th of December 1993, the MDR political bureau met at the headquarters of the party.  The meeting was chaired by Mr. Dismas Nsengiyaremye.  I can spell Nsengiyaremye for the purposes of the records.  
Q.	Please do that. 
A.	N-S-E-N-G-I-Y-A-R-E-M-Y-E.  He was the first vice-president of the party -- of the MDR party, and it was he who chaired that meeting that took place on the 30th of December.  And since transition officers were supposed to be in place as soon as possible, and since I do recall very well the personalities of the RPF had arrive -- had arrived in Kigali on the 28th of December, that is, two days before, the MDR met to appoint the members who were supposed to participate -- was (inaudible) in the broad-based transitional government.  There were six, yes.  
Q.	I simply asked you to identify the date and the person that was involved in your appointment as you see it and you've given us that.  So let's go back to this document.  
A.	That is what I want to do.  I want to name names.  I want to name names.  I want to give you the 
	six candidates for each position.  
Q.	We're only interested in you.  Okay?  So let's turn to the document.  For the record, this is annex 31 in the expert report that had been prepared by André Guichaoua, and it's simply a listing of the nominations of various ministers to various governments.  And I'd like us to look at the second page of this listing.  It has the government of the 18th of July 1993.  This is the government of Agathe Uwilingiyimana and that was the government that was in place basically through the 
6th of April 1994.  

So, Mr. Niyitegeka, turning to you, you were not a part of Agathe Uwilingiyimana's government, right?  It's a simple question.  You can just tell us "no".  Right? 
A.	No.  I was proposed, but I turned down the -- the offer.  
Q.	Well, we disagree.  You were not proposed.  But the answer to the question is no, you were not a part of her government.  And you had never been a minister before in any previous government of Rwanda, that's also true, right?  I'm not talking about your conception of your nomination.  You were never a minister prior to the 18th of July 1993.  That's true, isn't it? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecutor, you claim that I was not proposed?  Is that the truth?  You have to speak the truth.  I was proposed and I turned down the offer.  I was proposed by the MDR political bureau and I turned down the offer.  And it was my right to do so.  I did not feel compelled to be part of a government which I didn't want to be in.  
Q.	And the question remains unanswered.  You were never a minister prior to the 18th of July 1993; right? 
A.	I said no.  
Q.	And when we go to the next page, which is the list of ministers -- 
A.	(Microphones overlapping)
Q.	-- it's the following page and the bottom says 364. 
A.	What page?
Q.	This is the list of ministers that were supposed to be appointed pursuant to the Arusha Accords as of the 18th of March 1994, the list proposed by Faustin Twagiramungu who was the prime minister designate.  And in order to implement the broad-based transitional government, these are the ministers that were supposed to take the oath of office to implement the BBTG --- or the broad-based transitional government.  And your name is not among them; right? 
A.	Yes, I have the list indeed.  And you also have the minister of information therein, and you can see that the name of the minister of information does not appear there.  
Q.	So we're agreed that you were not proposed by Faustin Twagiramungu to be a minister in the BBTG; right? 
A.	Counsel, but I'd said so, and I insist that I was proposed by the party.  Twagiramungu refused my candidacy, but he was not able to designate someone else.  That is why you can see two people under one -- under one ministry.  
Q.	And what I'd like to suggest to you, Mr. Niyitegeka, is that for a person with your profile and background, the assembly of the interim government of the 8th of April 1994, your extraordinary circumstances under which that government was formed, was an opportunity for you personally because in no other circumstance would someone like you be appointed to be a minister in a government in Rwanda.  Isn't that true? 
A.	That is an affrontery, Counsel for the Prosecutor.  And if counsel so -- if the Judges so allow, I am going to institute proceedings against this.  I'm going to actually complain.  
Q.	Well, you can respond.  
A.	I will launch a -- I will launch a complaint.  I am launching a complaint against the Prosecutor who is offending me.  To state that I didn't have that status is an offence to the Rwandan people, not only to my person, but to the entire Rwandan people.  

I was not denied by anyone even for the three months in which I was in that position.  I believe that I did my best and no one disavowed me.  So what you're doing is you're offending both the people of Rwanda and myself and it is unfortunate that you -- the Prosecutor, who is part of this Tribunal, is further making this Tribunal to lose credit.  You have no proof for what you claim.  
Q.	Well, tell us, Mr. Niyitegeka, when and how were you contacted to become an interim government minister back in April of 1994?  
A.	I hope that my application -- my request has been -- has been -- is in the records because this is a slap in the face, a kick in the teeth because it is an insult to the people of Rwanda, and I hope that the 
Trial Chamber has taken due note of it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we did not think that question put to you called for the reaction that you had to it.  This is cross-examination and the question was one which was capable of being answered.  You could have provided an answer which would have addressed the question that was being asked which simply 
was, to use other language, was that your background was one which may or may not have qualified you for membership of a government under other circumstances.  And you could have answered the question, so we don't feel it necessary to reprimand the Prosecutor for that.  Let's proceed.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, let's turn to my last question.  When and how were you contacted to become a member of the interim government? 
A.	I heard it over Radio Rwanda.  
Q.	On what date? 
A.	On the 8th of April.  
Q.	Tell us what the broadcast said to the best of your recollection.  
A.	In the -- the radio announced the names of the members of the new interim government.  
Q.	On the 8th of April? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Do you recall what time you heard this broadcast? 
A.	I didn't hear it myself, but my relatives heard it.  I was outside.  It was in the evening, and given the prevailing situation at that time, the officials of the neighbourhoods organised rounds, in Kigali at least, and as required.  I was also outside involved in a night round.  

I was called to inform me about the news.  I went back and told the official, which was one 
Binego; he was Tutsi.  He was in charge of our cellule.  I told him that I had been appointed minister and that resultantly, he had to excuse me from returning to the night round.  
Q.	So, Mr. Niyitegeka, you're suggesting that the leaders of the party, Froduoald Karamira and 
Donat Murego, did not contact you directly and discuss this appointment with you before it was announced on the radio? 
A.	Neither of them contacted me in that respect.  
Q.	And the radio told you what?  What did it ask you to do?  Or what did your wife or your family tell you was being asked of you on Radio Rwanda? 
A.	That I had been appointed minister of information.  
Q.	That's the extent of your answer?  
A.	What more do you want me to say as an answer?  
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, I'm really looking forward to you being a bit more expansive on a point such as this one, which is just a simple factual recitation of what happened, because here when it's a matter of facts, you're very terse in your responses.  

Let me approach the issue by directing you to your own trial, because I believe your Defence attorney in her opening statement during your own trial informed the Court that tried you that on the morning of the 9th of April, an armoured vehicle manned by armed soldiers turned up at your house where you and your wife and children were cowering in fear, and that these soldiers told you that you were now a minister and had to leave with them.  

So that's how it was addressed in your own trial.  Now you're telling us that you were on a night patrol in your neighbourhood and your wife came and told you that Radio Rwanda announced you -- announced that you were a minister.  

So I'm trying to find out from you how it came to be that you were appointed to this interim government.  And let me also tell you, Mr. Witness, that although witnesses and ministers who addressed the issue of being appointed to the interim government have a different way of explaining their appointment, everyone else but you seems to suggest that they were contacted by the leaders of their parties and brought to a meeting at the ESM, and that decisions were made at a meeting on the 8th of April on who should be appointed to the various ministries.  

So now you have all of the information at my disposal, you can give us your response.  I want to know how you now characterise your rise to the status of minister of information in the interim government.  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecutor, as stated a while ago, as far as the MR -- MDR is -- is confirmed (sic), personally no one contacted me, neither Murego nor Karamira prior to my appointment.  But there was a waiting list which had been drawn since the 30th of December 1993.  You have Rwamakuba who had already been designated, Jean Bicamumpaka who had -- who had also been chosen.  So personally I was not contacted by either of those two personalities.  And on the morning of the 9th, yes, that armoured vehicle -- yes, that armoured vehicle had been sent by Colonel Ndibwami, which came and took me from the house because, indeed, we were scared and we couldn't go there.  

Everybody was scared.  And when an armoured vehicle arrived, we were even more scared.  But the -- then I realised that the armoured vehicle was then to escort me to take me there.  So I went there escorted by an armoured vehicle.  I didn't go there with my own vehicle.  
Q.	Should I understand from your evidence that you heard about your appointment on the night of April 8th on the radio as interpreted to -- or communicated to you by your wife, and that you were simply picked up the next morning and taken to the swearing-in ceremony on the morning of the 9th?  That's it? 
A.	Exactly.  That's what -- what you say, but that's not all.  
Q.	Well, what I'm trying to find out is, did you go to a meeting at the ESM, like everybody else, did to meet with the crisis committee and with the leaders of your party who were involved in setting up this government? 
A.	I never attended that ESM meeting.  
Q.	When and how did you learn that Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana had been killed by Presidential Guards?  
A.	I heard about her death through a phone call which was made by someone I no longer recall.  But I remember that I heard about it on the 9th of April, but I no longer remember the person who had telephoned me.  
Q.	So your testimony is you heard about her death after you were sworn in as a minister? 
A.	That is not the truth.  I said prior to the swearing-in ceremony.  That must have been the 8th -- maybe the 7th, in the afternoon.  
Q.	You just told us the 9th.  That's what I heard in English.  So that's where my confusion comes in.  So let me ask the question again and you can clarify it:  When and how did you first learn that 
Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana had been killed by soldiers? 
A.	Counsel, to speak the truth, I'd like to inform you that when I heard about the death of President Habyarimana on the evening of the 6th of April, the same evening I personally called 
Agathe Uwilingiyimana.  

I called her to ask her what we were to do, considering the circumstances.  And she told me what 
was -- what had happened and on the 7th -- or maybe the 8th, one of those two days, somebody called me to tell me that Agathe, rather, had been assassinated.  But personally I talked with Agathe.  
She is -- she was somebody I had known from far -- for long.  We both started university on the same day in 1972.  So we continued to be friends.  

I called her and asked her what we were to do.  But I learned that the next day or -- she was murdered.  That is the truth.  
Q.	So you don't remember whether it was the 7th or the 8th; right? 
A.	The date she died was the 7th.  
Q.	I'm asking you when you first became aware that she had been killed by soldiers.  That's the question.  And your response, as I understand it, is that you don't remember.  It was either on the 7th or the 8th.  
A.	I might have heard about it in the afternoon of the 7th or on the 8th.  I can't be sure.  
Q.	Thank you.  When and how did you first learn that Kavaruganda, Lando, Ngango, Nzamurambaho, all of those quote/unquote moderate politicians -- when did you learn that they had been killed and how? 
A.	With regard to those other politicians, I heard about it on the 9th of April, the day of the swearing-in.  
Q.	You did not hear about those killings prior to arriving at the Hôtel des Diplomates for the swearing-in ceremony? 
A.	Never.  
Q.	Well, how did you make sense of the process you were being called to participate in?  It was the death of Agathe Uwilingiyimana and the deaths of Kavaruganda, Lando, Ngango, of a whole political class that created the vacuum that was then filled by the government you joined.  So you have to explain to us what was going through your mind when you were brought to take the oath of office for a new government that could only be put in place because all of these people had been killed.  
A.	I was expecting to die myself because I didn't have any form of security.  I kept feeling that I could die at any time as those others had been murdered.  Considering the security situation at the time, 
	fire -- gunfire here and there, I felt a sense of insecurity because the people who had murdered those could have murdered me at any time.  Why not? 
Q.	Before you took the oath of office on the 9th of April, you knew that soldiers had killed all of those people or caused their disappearance.  Isn't that so? 
A.	I stated that I heard about their assassination when I arrived at the Hôtel des Diplomates for the swearing-in ceremony.  And I also indeed learnt that they had been killed by soldiers and those 
soldiers -- those very soldiers could also have killed me.  So I was expecting to die at any time.  
Q.	Are you suggesting that you were coerced into joining the interim government on the 9th of April?  
Is that your testimony? 
A.	No, no, that's not what I'm saying.  But what I stated is that I expected to die at any time.  The same as even at home, I expected to die at any time, given the prevailing situation.  
Q.	And it seems that you're expressing fear of your own Rwandan government soldiers.  I haven't heard you say anything about the RPF.  You thought the soldiers -- Habyarimana's soldiers were going to kill you?  That's your testimony? 
A.	But Agathe Uwilingiyimana was killed by the very same soldiers, as well as Kavaruganda, Nzamurambaho.  They were killed by the same soldiers.  They could've killed me as well.  Why not? 
Q.	What was your understanding of the role of Bagosora that morning when you arrived to be sworn in on the 9th of April? 
A.	All I knew about Bagosora was he was director of cabinet and the minister of defence.  And the 
minister of defence was not in the country.  But if my memory serves me well, Bagosora was not an active military staff.  He was retired, but he was in charge of the minister -- ministry of defence when the minister of defence was not there.  
Q.	Were you aware on the morning of the 9th of April, before taking the oath of office, that Bagosora had ordered the killing of Agathe Uwilingiyimana and all of these moderate politicians to make way for the government that you were now joining? 
A.	Counsel, I can't tell who ordered them to be killed.  
Q.	Well, when did you first learn that it was Bagosora that was behind those killings?  If it wasn't before you took the oath of office on the 9th of April, when did you first become aware of his role in killing those moderate politicians so that the interim government could be set up? 
A.	Even to date, I don't know whether it is -- it has been established that he is the one who ordered those assassinations.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Niyitegeka, I think it's a matter of common knowledge that Trial Chamber I convicted Bagosora and held him individually criminally responsible for ordering the killings that took place on that morning.  And here I'm referring to the killing of the prime minister, Agathe Uwilingiyimana, and the killing and disappearance -- disappearances of several of the other ministers and party leaders who were eliminated so that the government you joined could be set up.  
A.	If that is the finding of the Tribunal, that is its finding.  But I don't -- I didn't know that.  But as I stated earlier, and as I know that some of those findings are erroneous, especially with respect to this Tribunal, because I'm a victim of it, I know that -- I know Bagosora is going to appeal.  I think that we shouldn't go too fast, unless he entered a guilty plea for those charges.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Niyitegeka, you have characterised this interim government as the Abatabazi, A-B-A-T-A-B-A-Z-I.  And you've explained in a radio broadcast that they were the government of the saviours.  
A.	Yes.  And I explained why it was the government of the saviours.  
Q.	Tell us.  
A.	Since you allow me to, I will do so.  The government that was set up on the 9th of April 1994 was a government of the saviours because the country was in an abyss, in chaos.  It had no president of the republic, no president of the constitutional court, without a president of the opposition party, the PSD; no vice-president of the PL, no vice-president -- sorry.  No two vice-presidents of the PL party, no 
prime minister, no army chief of staff.  

So there was a political vacuum, an institutional vacuum.  The country had fallen into an abyss, into chaos.  And the three days prior to the setting up of the government had, indeed, been days of pure hell.  

You needed somebody to sort out -- to resolve the problem, to calm the situation, to stop the massacres.  The objective of the government was to restore security in the country.  The objective of the government was to assist starving people, to save those who had not yet been murdered.  And, as a matter of fact, the first meeting of the cabinet, which was held on the 9th of April 1994 in the afternoon, you see -- saw some of the -- you saw some of the items that were on the agenda was to save the country from that chaos, from that bottomless pit.  

It is in that regard that the government was the government of the saviours.  It set up things as from nothing.  I was appointed the minister of information -- for information myself.  I had no office.  I never entered the office of the minister because the prevailing situation did not allow me to do so.  But I didn't resign.  I tried to hang in and I made speeches, as you heard both yesterday and today.  

No, I'm not done.  I'm not done --  
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, I asked you one question.  You've answered that question.  We can get to the other aspects of your response -- 
A.	Okay.  Very well.  
Q.	You as well as president - the interim president, Sindikubwabo, and the interim prime minister, 
Jean Kambanda, all used the term Abatabazi, and you all explained it in similar ways.  Was that something that you had discussed as a matter of policy in the interim government, how you would characterise yourselves as the Abatabazi?  
A.	Never.  
Q.	So it was just a spontaneous occurrence that you used that term, and Prime Minister Kambanda used that term and President Sindikubwabo used that term.  It was -- 
A.	To be candid, it was spontaneous.  
Q.	But there must have been other similar issues, issues of importance to how your government presented itself both to the world and to the Rwandan people, that was a matter of discussion between the president of that government, the prime minister of that government and the spokesman of that government, who would be you as minister of information.  
A.	Please, can you be more concrete.  
Q.	I'm just asking you as a general proposition -- as a general matter, wasn't there discussion between you, the prime minister and the president, on how you should represent the government or how they should -- all of you should represent the government to its public? 
A.	I can assure you I never held a meeting apart -- just the president of the republic, the prime minister and myself.  Never.  Never.  To the best of my knowledge, we never held a meeting just the three of us.  No.  No such thing happened.  
Q.	Well, I wasn't asking you about a meeting that the three of you would've held.  I'm just trying to get from you whether there weren't issues that you discussed, even if the meetings went beyond three people, on how the interim government should be presented to the public.  If you say that there was no such discussion, then I'll move on to my next series of questions.  But that's basically what I'm trying to find out.  
A.	Besides what appears in the meeting of the 9th April -- meeting and also the records of the meeting of the 10th of April for the policy or the government programme as was laid down by the prime minister.  
Q.	Well, can we at least say, Mr. Niyitegeka, that you more than any other minister should be familiar with the policies of the interim government, since it would've been your responsibility to publicly articulate them.  
A.	More than the other ministers?  Well, you're -- that is giving me extra honours because I never was above the other ministers.  I was a minister of information.  I was government spokesperson, but I had no other edge over all the other ministers.  
Q.	Well, I'm suggesting to you that in your role as government spokesperson, you more than anyone else should be familiar with the government policy because it was your responsibility to publicly articulate it.  If that's not true, then I'll move on.  But it gets us right back to the issue that you took offence to when I suggested that the interim government was probably the only opportunity that you would ever have to be a spokesman of any government or to be a minister of any government.  Don't government spokespersons articulate the policy of the government that appoints them? 
A.	Not only the spokespersons.  All members of the government explain government policy each in his or her own sphere.  
Q.	Well, then I'll suggest it to you this way:  You, as every other minister, would be familiar with the 
interim government's policy and be able to explain it publicly.  
A.	Well, I think, Mr. Prosecutor, we need to be clear on these issues.  Government comprised 
19 ministries.  I could not know the ministry of family affairs more than the minister of family affairs.  I could not master the ministry of trade more than the minister of trade.  I could not know the ministry of the interior more than the minister of the interior.  I could very well know the ministry of information as minister of information.  But from there to establish that I could know the other ministerial departments more than the other ministers, that would be -- that would be -- that would be lending me more power than I had.  
Q.	Was it the policy of your government to hide its murderous origin? 
A.	Can you be clear?  I didn't get your question.  
Q.	Was it the policy of your government, the interim government of the 8th of April 1994, and your policy as spokesman for that government to hide the fact that it came into existence because a whole 
	political class had been murdered?  And I'm not talking about President Habyarimana.  I'm talking about 
Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, Landouald Ndasingwa, Kavaruganda, Ngango, the whole list of politicians that had been killed on the 7th and the 8th of April.  
A.	Well, it's unfortunate that you avoid President Habyarimana.  And yet it was him who was the one that was known as the member of the broad-based transitional government.  So to say -- to say that government was stemmed from the void created by the head of state and the head of the military, to avoid -- to -- not to mention him would be an aberration.

1215H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Your interim government never condemned the Presidential Guards that killed 
Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana and sexually mutilated her corpse, did it? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, it was our government.  What's the government?  Government is an institution.  Government was supposed to condemn.  What do you mean, condemn?  This was denounced in speeches.  We saw that yesterday from the speech of the prime minister, the speech he delivered before the press.  He denounced the crimes of -- the abuses of the soldiers.  

Now, Prosecution, what do you consider?  It's the government that prosecutes.  And we asked the ministry of justice to take care of that.  
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, I'm not talking about generalised killing.  I'm talking about the specific murders of Agathe Uwilingiyimana, Lando, Ngango, Nzamurambaho, all of the politicians that had to be eliminated in order for your government to be put in place.  You never condemned those killings by 
	Rwandan soldiers, did you?  Those specific killings.
A.	But, to begin with, I must say that these assassinations did not take place for our government to be put in place.  On that I do not agree with you.  I do not agree with you on that.  I never struggled to be part of any government.  I had enough wealth.  I was a businessman.  And so, to claim that we struggled or that people were killed so that I should become a member of government on that, no I totally disagree with you.  

And so, as for any prosecution to be done, we asked the minister of justice to take care of that, 
and it was the duty of the prosecutor to address the issue.  It was also the responsibility of those persons in charge of security.  It was to the judiciary.  This was not work that was cut out for the 
minister of information to handle. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Niyitegeka, let's go back and look at some of the same radio broadcast that you examined with Mr. Nimy in your direct examination.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And here I refer the parties to document 11 in my bundle, which is the French text of D. NZ301; document number 10 is the English text.  These are all excerpts from the exhibit that's already in evidence.  If Mr. Issa could hand this up to the witness, it's the French text of that radio broadcast on the 10th of April.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And in the text that -- the excerpt that you have, Mr. Niyitegeka, there is numbering on the sides of the paragraphs so that we can follow what each other is reading in both the French and the English.  The copies that I circulated to the parties and the Chamber are my excerpts, which are all numbered.  

So we will begin with what Kambanda says on the 10th of April, and then we will look at what you say.  So where I have paragraph number 1, which is at the bottom of page 7 in the English text, it says, 
	"The crisis committee set up by the minister of defence was created following the vacuum, the institutional vacuum.  Both --"  

Let me stop there for a second.  You and I both know, Mr. Niyitegeka, that the minister of defence wasn't in the country in order to set up the crisis committee.  That was done by Bagosora personally.  Isn't that so? 
A.	The crisis committee -- yes, you are right.  I was not part of that committee, but I suppose that it was he who created that committee. 
Q.	Okay.  So Kambanda is claiming it was the minister of defence or the ministry of defence.  We all know it was Bagosora that did that.  

He talks about an institutional vacuum when it was created.  We all know that that committee was created on the night of the 6th of April.  But the institutional vacuum didn't take place until the next morning when all of these moderate politicians were killed.  Isn't that so? 
A.	But you must first of all note that within this crisis committee and during its meeting on the night of the 6th breaking 7th April, Mr. Roméo Dallaire was part of that meeting.  He attended that meeting.  
Roméo Dallaire was head of UNAMIR.  He attended that meeting.  So, to say -- well, I don't know what you are headed at, because the committee of the meeting apparently was a -- 
Q.	The next sentence:  "Both the president of the republic and head of government had died, and the government could no longer meet."  

We both know that the head of government did not just die.  She was killed by soldiers, 
Rwandan soldiers.  And it wasn't a matter of the government not being able to meet.  The 
government, or most of it, was killed by Rwandan soldiers.  Right?  
A.	Well, I don't know whether you are referring to a coup d'état, a type of coup d'état maybe.  
Q.	It's obvious that this was a coup d'etat.  And you were complicit with it by joining a government that killed its predecessors in order to occupy the state.  
A.	And what would you have suggested I did?  Allow this institutional vacuum and to allow people to go on dying?  Allow the soldiers to continue killing people like that?  

You need to see in my communiqué, which I published on the night of the 9th April, the appeal that I launched, I sent out to the soldiers.  We even read that this morning.  What did I say in my appeal to the soldiers?  At least show some good faith. 
Q.	Let's move on.  The next sentence:  "Therefore, the Rwandan armed forces -- and I wish to take this opportunity to commend them for your courage.  I shall come back to that later on -- the Rwandan armed forces tried to maintain national peace and security by setting up the 
crisis committee."  

So here we have the prime minister of your government congratulating the Rwandan armed forces, who had just killed Agathe Uwilingiyimana, Lando, Ngango -- all of the politicians that should have been governing were killed to make room for your government.  Right? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, if you recall, the text was read in Kinyarwanda.  In the same speech the prime minister made it clear that there are some elements who had gone out of control of the Rwandan armed forces.  He used those words, that within the army there were some uncontrolled elements.  But we needed to ask other members or elements of the Rwandan armed forces to help and to neutralise these uncontrolled elements.  That is how the prime minister's speech should be interpreted. 
Q.	Let's continue.  Next sentence:  "The crisis committee then invited the political parties in the 
transitional government to reconstitute, so to speak, with a view to setting up a new government.  One may wonder why the Arusha Peace Accords were not implemented immediately."
A.	Well, the implementation of the Arusha agreements supposed that they should be, first of all, the president of the republic, because ministers could not take oath of office without the presence of the president of the republic.  And who was it that killed the president of the republic?  Why -- why -- why do you behave as if you do not know him -- know this, even though you know it, Counsel.  No.  Be honest.  You know it.  And it is not Bagosora, as people tend to put it. 
Q.	The prime minister is asking why the Arusha Peace Accords were not implemented immediately; right?  And we both know that it wasn't simply -- or only the death of Habyarimana that stopped the accords from being implemented.  They could not be implemented because Rwandan soldiers killed the prime minister, killed the head of the constitutional court, killed the head of the PSD, killed one of the heads of the PL.  They killed everybody that would be needed to implement the Arusha Accords.  And your prime minister is washing over that in his first lengthy explanation to his people about the origins of his government.  

So what I am suggesting to you is that it was a policy of your government to hide its murderous origins.  Your government could not be implemented without killing all of those other people.
A.	Well, that is up to you.  That's your opinion as Prosecutor.  But that does not make it true.  I am saying that is not true. 
Q.	Can you think of any speech that Kambanda gave or Sindikubwabo gave or you, as 
	minister of information or government spokesman, gave where you specifically condemned the Presidential Guard and Rwandan soldiers for having killed a whole political class on the morning of the 7th of April through the morning of the 8th of April, right before you took the oath of office?  Anywhere.
A.	Well, Mr. Prosecutor, now -- well, this is 15 years after, and with all the investigations that have been carried out you know with certainty who killed who.  But let me assure you that on the morrow of these assassinations none could tell who was it that killed who and the reasons for which he killed the person.  This was not obvious.  It was not clear to anybody, in all honesty.  

So please do not believe that we were animated by bad faith.  Why did we call for putting an end to all these massacres?  Are you saying that our appeals had no impact?  No.  If that is so, then you are making a mistake.  If not -- if we had not appealed for a halt to the killings, if the interim government or transitional government had not been put in place, I swear to you Rwanda, all Rwanda, would have been decimated.  The Rwandans would have decimated themselves. 
Q.	Didn't you just tell us less than an hour ago that you learned before you took the oath of office on the 9th of April that soldiers had killed all of these moderate politicians, that you learned that when you arrived at the Hôtel des Diplomates to take the oath of office?  
A.	Of course.  It was not before.  But it was when I was going to take the oath of office, because the 
	first question that I asked was, "Why?  How come I can't see this person, I can't see that person, right there in the hall."  I was embarrassed by the answers which I got.  I myself was -- well, I did not 
	know -- I was taken aback.  I didn't know exactly what I could do.  But that was the reality in which I found myself.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, I see the time, and I think we can pause now and take up after lunch.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we'll take our luncheon adjournment now.  
(Court recessed from 1230H to 1420H)
MR. WEBSTER:
Good afternoon to everyone.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And good afternoon to you, Mr. Niyitegeka.
A.	Good afternoon, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	Sadly, we're not going to have enough time to go through everything that I had anticipated with 
D. NZ301, which is the press conference which you organised on the 10th of April 1994.  

But there is one other point I wanted to touch on before we move on, and it concerns paragraph 8 that I have numbered, which is -- it's on page 11 of the English text, which is document 10 in my bundle, and in the French text it should be page number 17.  And I think you still have the document that I gave 
you -- not so?  Which is D. NZ301.  

In any case, even if you don't have it, it's a short excerpt and I will read it, because I'd like to examine exactly how you described the interim government when you were presenting it to the people of Rwanda on the 10th of April.  And it breaks off.  We don't have the very beginning of your sentence.  But it says, "-- of his excellency, the president of the republic, Juvénal Habyarimana, on Wednesday last week after his plane crashed."  

And the next sentence:  "The council of ministers was not able to meet on Thursday to discuss about it."  

So in this sentence you're talking about the 7th of April, which is Thursday, the day after the president was killed in a plane crash or when his plane was shot down.  

"Some members of the government died, and others are unavailable because of the disturbances.  The field offices quickly set up what they called a crisis committee to lead the country during the crisis period."  

So let's -- you can explain it to us, but let's think about how you are describing the circumstances of the creation of this new government.  The council of ministers was not able to meet on Thursday, the 
7th of April, to discuss the shooting down of the president's plane.  Isn't that a complete whitewash of the situation?  

Because here you're talking about the government of Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana wasn't able to convene the following day to address the crisis.  She couldn't address the crisis because 
Rwandan soldiers killed her early that morning to prevent her from getting to the radio.  And you knew that.  

Some members of the government died.  Well, they didn't just die.  They were killed by 
Rwandan soldiers.  Others are unavailable.  They weren't simply unavailable.  They went into hiding, and the only ones that survived were the ones that hid.  

The field offices quickly set up what they called a crisis committee.  And you know that wasn't true also.  It wasn't the field offices that set up a crisis committee.  It was Bagosora that set up a crisis committee.  

So do you want to comment on how I have characterised what you said on the 10th of April?  
A.	I believe that the way I have presented the scenario points to the fact that I myself did not know -- did not know very well what had happened or what had transpired.  I was simply attempting to reconstitute the facts to the best of my ability.  In other words, I was not aware of what had really taken place.  So all I did was to reconstitute the facts as I understood them through this press conference which was going to take place. 
Q.	Yes, Mr. Witness.  But this morning we were talking about what you knew prior to taking the oath of office on the 9th in the morning.  And here we are already on the afternoon or the late morning of the 10th, and it should have been apparent to you from a day or two earlier that both the prior government, which is the one of Agathe Uwilingiyimana, and the one that was set to replace it under the 
Arusha Accords, which is the government that was going to be set up by Twagiramungu, was liquidated by soldiers, Rwandan soldiers, the same ones that were helping you to accede to power on the 
9th of April.  

And all that remained of civilian authority in Rwanda was the MRND and the Hutu Power wings of the other political parties.  Isn't that the case?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, you can interpret things your way, but the fact of the matter is that I say that 
normally -- and I say it normally because I'm not a jurist, I'm not a constitutional law expert, but I heard things, and I understood things.  And once the head of state was no longer there, the government should have been seized of the matter in order to manage the crisis.  And that is what I said.  And that was my position, namely, that the next day the government ought to have met to manage and deal with the crisis.  

But government could not meet because the prime minister was no longer there.  Who assassinated her?  I don't know.  Maybe you know better than I.  What I can say is that on the 10th of April I did not know who had killed her.  There were many soldiers at the prime minister's house, even 
UNAMIR soldiers who were guarding her residence.  There were gendarmes guarding her home, and there was no fighting at her residence.  Nobody made any mention of any fighting at her residence.  

So everybody was wondering how she was murdered.  But the fact is that if she had not -- if -- by the way, if we go back to the beginning of the crisis, if the president had not been killed, if the plane had not been shot down, I can bet you that all these things would never have happened.  If 
Agathe Uwilingiyimana had not been assassinated, the interim government would not have been set up because Agathe would have been able to call a meeting of her government.  

But because this crisis was expected, that is why you continue to claim that it was wrong of us to put in place the interim government and that it was wrong of us to try to set up that government which tried to manage the crisis, which actually had been initiated by the assassination of President Habyarimana.  

You see, the head had been cut off.  Instead of going after the person who had cut off the head, you are trying to deal with the other party, and I think this is absurd, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, what I am suggesting to you is not that another government should not have been set up on the 9th of April.  What I am suggesting to you is that the government that you joined on the 9th of April deliberately hid and misrepresented its origins.  That government that you joined that you call the Abatabazi government was predicated not on the death of Habyarimana but on the killing of Agathe Uwilingiyimana and all the other moderate politicians that had either belonged to her government or were anticipated to be part of the BBTG, the broad-based transitional government.  And you knew that.  And you never condemned the soldiers that killed them.  

We have hundreds of broadcasts, much documentation with which you are familiar from your own case.  If you know of any document or broadcast from your government which specifically condemns the soldiers for killing the prime minister, you can bring it to our attention.  So that's the point.
A.	I didn't quite understand your question. 
Q.	We can move on to something else.  
A.	No.  No.  The question was so long, I didn't quite know what specific question you were asking.  
Q.	I believe I was responding to a concern that you raised and giving you another opportunity to comment on the suggestion that I've been making to you.  But we can move on.  We can get back to it through other questions.  What I'd like to address now is how other members of your government characterised the same events that we've been discussing.  

Now, you claim that you never went to the ESM, you never participated in meetings of the 
	crisis committee.  But let me read to you an excerpt from a statement, a sworn statement, of 
Gaspard Ruhumuliza, who became the minister of tourism in the Abatabazi government.  And on 
page 13 of the English text of that statement -- it's actually a commission rogatoire that was executed on the -- in February of 2005 -- the 24th of February 2005. 

"During the entire process" -- and here he is referring to the process of assembling the interim government because he was present at ESM on the 8th and was privy to how things were being ushered in.  "During the entire process it was felt that Ngirumpatse, Karemera, Nzirorera and Bagosora acted behind the scene and seemed to influence the course of events, but did not want to come to the fore.  There were views that it was a deliberate strategy by the MRND to place personalities from the south at the forefront during the period of crisis, pending a strong comeback of influential personalities from the north after the establishment of interim institutions."  

So I'd like to have your reaction to what Ruhumuliza is saying there.  Was it your view, based on what you could observe after the 9th of April, that Nzirorera, Ngirumpatse, Karemera and Bagosora were manipulating things in the background? 
A.	Firstly, you have to correct your assertion that I was in the ESM meeting.  That is wrong.  It is very wrong.  Counsel for the Prosecution, just desist from misleading the Chamber.  I was never in the meeting and there is no document to prove that.  

And I wonder, even if he claimed, Ruhumuliza claimed, that I was there, it was a lie, because I was not in that meeting in ESM.  So you have -- come on, Counsel for the Prosecution, you have to be honest, you have to be truthful, at least.  
Q.	I think there was probably a misstatement or a misunderstanding on your part, because that's not what I suggested.  I acknowledged your testimony that you were not present at the ESM for any of those meetings.  

But my question to you is in relation to comments from Ruhumuliza, who was there.  So I'm asking you if. on the 9th of April, when you arrived at the Hôtel des Diplomates and at any period after that, whether you drew the same conclusion that he did based on what he was seeing on the 8th, which was that the MRND leaders and Bagosora were manipulating things in the background.
A.	Thank you for agreeing and acknowledging that I did not attend that meeting.  As to what Ruhumuliza states, he, who attended that meeting, I believe that it is incumbent upon him to say it again, and then he will be cross-examined on it.  Alternatively, he can talk about meetings that he attended as he wishes.  

I did not attend that meeting, and I don't intend to comment about it unless you summon him before the Chamber.  Maybe he will change what he said.  It all depends under what circumstances he said it.  In any event, I will refrain from commenting on a statement made by a person, whereas I wasn't with that person.  You have to spare me that. 
Q.	Would you have any reason to dispute his characterisation, any specific knowledge that you yourself had that would dispute or weaken his analysis that it was Bagosora and the MRND leaders that were manipulating things from the background during that initial period? 
A.	But I said that Gaspard Ruhumuliza made his analysis based on what he saw, and he told you his point of view.  I am not bound by his point of view because I was not there.  Had I been in that meeting, I would have been in a position to give my point of view and confront it to him.  But considering the fact that I did not attend that meeting, I do not understand how you can ask me to express an opinion on a version -- or on things I did not witness. 
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, I'm not asking you to comment on the meeting of the 8th of April because you have already told us you weren't there.  I'm asking you to reflect on what you yourself observed and lived through on the 9th and 10th and 11th and thereafter when you were interacting with these various individuals.  

So based on your experience of events from the 9th of April going forward, did you get the impression that the MRND leaders and Bagosora were manipulating things from the sidelines? 
A.	As far as I am concerned, I never had a meeting with the MRND people, and I never had any meeting with Bagosora.  Whether they were pulling the strings from the back, be it Bagosora, be it the 
	MRND people, they can explain before the Tribunal themselves.  But, candidly, I never held a meeting neither with Bagosora nor the MRND people, none whatsoever. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you for your response.  

Ruhumuliza also comments that, "On that day --" again he's referring to the 8th of April "-- between 
9 and 10 p.m. at ESM, after taking formal note of --" 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Excuse me.  

Mr. President, I would like to object.  This is a document which for 10 to 15 minutes has been presented to the witness, who has stated that they cannot comment on one sentence or one word in the document because they don't know under what circumstances that testimony was made.  He cannot defend that document, and he cannot intend to talk about it, and the Prosecutor is continuing to put this document to him.  I would like to object and ask whether the Bench would like to leave us in this situation for long.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, this is the last question I had with respect to this document.  And I would suggest that it's an appropriate question in cross-examination, to put propositions to the witness and hear his response, so that's what I'm doing.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I would like to second that this gentleman, Mr.  Ruhumuliza, is expected to be a Prosecution witness, so why did the Prosecution not call him to the bar?  It would have been easier if that was done for that document to be discussed in cross.  He didn't call him.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we think the question can be asked.  The witness does not have to be present at the meeting to be able to comment on the proposition that the Prosecutor is putting to him.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So let me rephrase, Mr. Witness.  This is Ruhumuliza once again:  "On that day --" referring to the 
8th of April "-- between 9 and 10 p.m. at ESM, after taking formal note of the list of 
ministerial candidates, General Ndindiliyimana, on behalf of his colleagues of the FAR high command, announced that the mandate of the crisis committee had ended."  

So what I'd like to suggest to you, Mr. Niyitegeka, is that if we can rely on what Ruhumuliza says in his statement, that it wasn't until 9 or 10 p.m. that a formal note listing ministerial candidates was presented to Ndindiliyimana, which put an end to the crisis committee, then I'd suggest to you that it's unlikely that any Radio Rwanda broadcast would have taken place before 10 p.m. in relation to any list of ministers.  
So is it consistent with your recollection of events that you were only informed of your appointment sometime after 10 p.m. on the 8th of April?  
A.	Meaning that you doubt what I said, right?  What I said is I learnt about it in the evening of the 
8th of April on Radio Rwanda, and I insist on that.  I wonder why you are doubting me.  What are the grounds you have to doubt what I'm saying?  You have documents.  That is -- that is accusing me for nothing. 
Q.	Well, what I would suggest to you, Mr. Niyitegeka, is that no other minister, not one, describes -- that I'm aware of, in any case known to the Office of the Prosecutor -- ever describes being informed about their appointment to the interim government as a minister by radio.  You're the only one.  

So I'd like you to reconsider your testimony on that point, and maybe you would like to amend it.  But if you are insistent that you learned for the first time about your ministerial appointment from a 
Radio Rwanda broadcast on the evening of the 8th of April, then we will take note of it in the 
trial record.
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I will give you a reference with respect to what I said.  The reference is found on your side.  Cassette number 947 -- 45 of Radio Rwanda, the speech that I made in Butare.  I clearly stated that I learnt that I had been appointed minister on the night of the 8th of April while I was on -- in (inaudible)  and that I learnt it over the radio.  I said it on the 30th of April, and I'm not about to change it now.  And at the time I was not scared.  I wasn't scared of anything when I said it.  

On the 30th of April, cassette number 945 in your keeping, that's the cassette of Radio Rwanda.  Look at the speech made by Niyitegeka in Butare.  That is what I said.  And that is what I insist on telling you.  This is not speculation.  If other people were consulted, for I, it's unfortunate, but that's how it was. 
Q.	Well, we will have an opportunity to go over that broadcast, and you can read its transcript for yourself.   But I can assure you that nowhere on that broadcast do you say that you heard about your appointment on the radio.  You say you heard about it when you were doing night rounds.  But your speech does not address the question I asked, which is, "When did you first become aware of your appointment?"  So we'll look at it together later on in my examination.
A.	But that's what I told you.  I was in the night rounds.  I was not the one who listened to the radio.  My family listened to the radio and told me about the news.  But I heard it over the radio.  

But as you're confirming, this was broadcast over the radio, according to your information, after Ndindiliyimana had received the final list for the proposed candidates for -- to be minister.  And this was on the 8th in the evening.  That's when that list was broadcast over the radio, and that is the time when my family heard about it.  I was on a round, a night round, and I was told about it.  So you also corroborate what I just said. 
Q.	So you had no conversation with Karamira or Murego prior to the 9th of April in relation to this matter of your ministerial appointment? 
A.	At no point in time did I discuss with any of the people you just mentioned. 
Q.	We'll move on.  You also told us that you feared the soldiers, that you yourself were afraid of the soldiers at the Hôtel des Diplomates on the morning of the 9th of April when you arrived to take the 
oath of office.  Did you also fear the Interahamwe that morning? 
A.	I was scared of the soldiers because, as far as people like Nzamurambaho, Agathe Uwilingiyimana, such as Kavaruganda, all those people were people I knew and had been killed by soldiers.  I feared that sooner or later I would be killed by the soldiers, saying that "They were killed because they were moderates."  I could also be described as being a moderate.  There was no association of moderates.  There was no proof to show that such and such was a moderate.  

People simply had -- you had to say something with respect to who had to be a militant for me to be killed.  You talk about the Interahamwe.  I was also scared of the Interahamwe, as the Interahamwe also killed people.  They killed.  But I told you that what is referred to as Interahamwe -- in reality, who are these people?  They are infiltrators.  If you didn't know who was killing who, even the -- even the RPF, people had taken the fabric, which was known as Interahamwe fabrics, which they used to disguise themselves, and they got into the crowds and into the neighbourhoods.  In brief, I was scared.  In one word, I was scared. 
Q.	And we can agree, or you can agree with me, that you knew that it was Bagosora that controlled the Presidential Guards on that morning, and it was Nzirorera, Ngirumpatse and Karemera, as 
MRND leaders, that were controlling the Interahamwe youth wing on that morning, right? 
A.	Bagosora had relative control on the soldiers of the Presidential Guard.  But I'm saying relative because, firstly, he was on retirement.  He was an ex-serviceman.  He was no longer an active soldier.  

Secondly, he was nearly a cabinet -- director of cabinet.  He was not even the minister of defence.  The real person in charge of the Presidential Guard was Mpiranya.  

And above him you had the army chief-of-staff, Nsabimana, Déogracias Nsabimana.  You need to 
be -- to understand who killed Déogracias Nsabimana as the army chief-of-staff.  They didn't know what would happen afterwards.  Could Bagosora control Déogracias?  I would say it's relative.  

With respect to the MRND official control over the Interahamwe, that control was not (inaudible) because there was no coercive authority they had over the Interahamwe.  Could they (inaudible) sanctions on them?  No.  I doubt.  What sort of sanctions?  

All they could have done was to appeal to them not to do what they were doing.  And furthermore, which Interahamwe?  The RPF infiltrators who were disguised as Interahamwe?  Bandits who were disguised as Interahamwe?  Or the true Interahamwes, MRND?  

The truth is that it was chaotic.  You don't want to believe it, but that's what it was. 
Q.	In any case, Mr. Witness -- and here I'm talking about the period of the 9th-10th of April.  I'm trying to localise us in time and space.  I'm talking about Kigali during those first few days after the crash of the plane, around the 9th and 10th, after you became a minister.  

Thinking of that period, wouldn't you agree that the muscle, the force behind the interim government were those soldiers and the Interahamwe, those soldiers, referring to the same PG, Presidential Guard, that Bagosora had relative control over, as you have characterised it?  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I don't -- you have repeated the question.  I wonder whether you want me to repeat the answer I had given to the same question.
(Pages 29 to 40 by Claudette Ask)

























1500H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Well, I'll rephrase it.  Maybe I have repeated it.  I am not aware of that.  

But my suggestion to you is:  Wasn't the muscle or the force, the power behind the interim government during those first few days, the Presidential Guard soldiers that Bagosora had relative control over and the Interahamwe that responded to Nzirorera and Ngirumpatse and Karemera? 
A.	Firstly, I think you have to clarify things.  The Presidential Guard is not the government power, it is the Presidential Guard.  It is a specific corps.  The Interahamwe is not also a government force.  It couldn't have been a government force, and it was not a government force, as it couldn't have been one. 
Q.	Yes, but, Mr. Niyitegeka, what I'm suggesting to you is that it was Bagosora and Nzirorera and Ngirumpatse and Karemera that were really running the show at that particular moment.  And they had had the wherewithal to do that because they had control of the Presidential Guard and the Interahamwe who could threaten even a man like yourself.  
A.	Counsel, I told you that during that period I never -- period I never had any meeting with Bagosora, nor meeting with Ngirumpatse, nor with Karemera.  So to be candid, pulling strings, that is your different perception of things.  I can have a different perception of things and another person can have another perception.  But, truly, I never held any meeting with those people.  

I don't know how I can start commenting on what I think they could have done or the power that they might have had.  But Bagosora never came to meet with me personally.  I saw Bagosora when he toured Murambi on the 16th of April.  Well, what I mean is I talked to him when he came there on the 16th of April.  Prior to that, I had seen him go past, but I had never talked to Bagosora. 
Q.	I'm not asking you about meetings that you would have had with Bagosora or with Ngirumpatse or Karemera or Nzirorera.  I'm not talking about meetings.  I'm talking about your observations and your perception of the forces that were governing the situation on the 9th, 10th, 11th of April when you were in Kigali right after the interim government was installed.  

Wasn't it your perception that the muscle behind the scenes or -- excuse me, not the -- the muscle that could support the authority of the interim government that had just been implanted was the 
Presidential Guard who responded to Bagosora's relative control and the Interahamwe that was subject to the authority of MRND leaders?  

So I'm asking for your analysis, not whether you attended a meeting.  
A.	My understanding of Bagosora -- Bagosora's control over the army, the Presidential Guard, well, what I can say is that as a former soldier, a senior retired soldier, and as director of cabinet in the 
	ministry of defence, he must have or may have been in a position to give orders to the 
	Presidential Guard, but I do not know.  I was not a soldier, so I do not know how far those orders could go and what value could be attached to the orders.

Now, since you have asked me for my own analysis, let us understand that it may be a mistaken analysis.  

Now, as for the leaders of the MRND and their control over the Interahamwe, in that case when we are dealing with Interahamwes/MRND, then the officials of the MRND must to some extent be responsible for the Interahamwe.  But they were not able to have full control over that organisation for the same reasons that I have been putting forth consistently since this morning.

I know that they may believe or they may say that they were able to, but in reality were they able to?  Did they really believe in it, that they had control?  Because they were asked.  They were indeed asked to call for the Interahamwe to stop engaging in any killings and acts of violence.  We asked them to do so.  You can find in my notes that this is what is written down, in the notes that were -- or that are pending admission which were tabled yesterday.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  We'll move on.

Would you agree that it was known to you by the morning of the 9th of April when you took the 
oath of office that there were already widespread killings of Tutsi civilians in Kigali?  
A.	A short while ago we enumerated some victims, including Kavaruganda, who was Hutu; Ngango, who is Hutu; Nzamurambaho, who is Hutu; and Uwilingiyimana, who is Hutu. 
Q.	We have gone beyond these political personalities.  I'm not asking you about them.  This is a 
	new question, so let me repeat it.

Wasn't it obvious to you?  Didn't you know by the morning of the 9th of April when you turned up to take the oath of office at the Hôtel des Diplomates that already there was widespread killing of Tutsi civilians in Kigali throughout the city in government controlled areas?  
A.	I knew that there were killings but that the killings -- I did not know that it was Tutsis who were exclusively targeted by these killings. 
Q.	When did you first become aware that it was Tutsis who were targeted in the generalised killings? 
A.	Do you want me to give you a date?  
Q.	Yes.  If you don't know a date, then describe it to us in relative terms.  I'd like to know when you first became aware that the widespread killings in Kigali were targeting Tutsi.  
A.	All I can say is that I did not remain in Kigali for a long time.  I was forced to leave Kigali on the 12th.  I fled the city and went to Gitarama in Murambi.  So what -- 
Q.	You're suggesting that when you left on the 12th, you still did not realise that there were 
	targeted attacks against Tutsi civilians in Kigali; is that your testimony? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I told you that I learnt of the deaths of the Hutus, even of those Hutus on the 9th, when I went to take the oath of office.  

On the 9th, after the oath of office, we had a council of ministers of meeting in the afternoon.  The 
next day, on the 10th, we had another council of ministers meeting in the morning.  And in the afternoon we had the press conference, in the afternoon.  Then on the 11th we had a meeting with the préfet, and on the 12th we were asked to leave Kigali town.  That is how my schedule was, and you can't blame me for that. 
Q.	Okay.  So your answer is clear on the record.  Perhaps you didn't know that there were targeted killings of Tutsi on the 9th, the 10th and the 11th, and you were not aware that Tutsi were being targeted by the time that you fled with the government to Rwanda (sic).  

But it's a matter of record in this trial, through Prosecution Exhibit 141 and Defence Exhibit D. NZ225, just to mention two, which are documents 4 and 5 in my bundle, that 
Special Representative Booh-Booh, at least, was reporting back to New York headquarters about the targeted killings of Tutsi.  But we'll move on.  

You told us that you didn't know as a member of the government, its spokesperson, 
minister of information, but there were many other people who seemed to have known that quite earlier, even before the 8th, when the government was set up.

I'd like to talk to you a bit -- ask -- respond if you care to, Mr. Niyitegeka.  I don't want to deprive you of a response.  
A.	Yes, yes.  I would like to react to your conclusion because it is a biased conclusion, in my opinion.  I did not say that I did not know any Tutsis who were assassinated or murdered.  I did not say that I was not aware of any Tutsis who had been assassinated or murdered.  What I said is that the widespread or generalised killings, as you have referred to, I -- I -- well, the situation was so confused that I could not know what was happening.  It wasn't clear.  It wasn't clear.  Now, I may know with hindsight, but at that time it was not obvious.  It wasn't clear.  Honestly it was not.  

Now, that type of information, you only get to find out about it when you are in meetings with other people or when you are discussing with other people.  I have already given you my schedule during that period, and I was not available.  And whenever I happened to be available, I also had to attend to the needs of my family.  Why not?  My family, why not, which was also frightened and also feared -- were also afraid of the possibility of being assassinated. 
Q.	Well, thank you for that, because your response is much more clear now.  
So I'll ask you the question again:  When did you first become aware of widespread killing of 
Tutsi civilians in Kigali?  When did you first become aware? 
A.	I'm not able to give you a specific date.  I don't know.  But what I can say is that at some point I denounced interethnic killings, any killings that targeted any ethnic groups.  That is why in my statement you would read that I stated clearly that no ethnic group should engage in the extermination of another.  I did condemn those killings. 
Q.	So you don't remember the date you first became aware, but you think it is sometime after you left Kigali, after the 12th, is that your evidence? 
A.	What would you think would have enabled me to become aware?  How would I have become aware of it?  I mean let us be clear on this point.  Was it published in a newspaper?  Was it broadcast over the radio?  And do you think I would have listened to that radio station?  Was there any call for the massacre of Tutsis and you are blaming me for not having listened to that call?  Let us clarify that matter.  How does one become aware of this type of information?  And through which channels, through whom?  
Q.	I think you've given a complete response, Mr. Niyitegeka.  We'll move on.  

Now, when the interim government was still in Kigali, where did you reside?  Did you stay at the 
Hôtel des Diplomates or somewhere else?  I'm talking about the period after the 9th of April when you were sworn in.  
A.	Personally, I -- I was in my home at Nyamirambo.  I went to the Hôtel des Diplomates on the 
	night of the 11th, but for the 9th and 10th I was at my home.  I spent the night at my home. 
Q.	So you just went to the Hôtel des Diplomates for meetings with the interim government during the days?  Or is it your testimony that you basically stayed at home until the 11th of April?  Clarify it for us, please.  
A.	That is my testimony, yes. 
Q.	I still don't understand you.  Did you spend the days at the Hôtel des Diplomates with the other members of government on the 9th, 10th, 11th? 
A.	I came to the Hôtel des Diplomates on the morning of the 9th of April for the swearing-in ceremony.  We had a council of ministers meeting in the afternoon.  I was there.  And after that meeting of the council, journalists of all leanings put a number of questions to me which I answered.  Then I went to the 
	radio station to give a report on the council of ministers meeting.  That was in the evening at 7 p.m.  And this is the -- my schedule, as far as I can remember.  

After that statement over radio, I went back home.  Then on the 10th, in the morning at around 9 a.m., I returned to the Hôtel des Diplomates where we had a meeting of the council of ministers.  Then at 
2 p.m. in the afternoon we held the press conference on the 10th, and it ran from 2 to about 4 or 5 p.m.  Then I still had to attend to some journalists.  They were there.  They had been waiting for me.  
And on the night of the 10th, I left the Hôtel des Diplomates at around 8, 8:30 p.m. in the evening or about 9 p.m.  In any event, it was in the evening, so I went back to my home.  

Then on the 11th, I returned to the Hôtel des Diplomates where we had a meeting with the préfet.  I spent just a brief moment at that meeting, and there were some problems at the radio station.  The director of the radio station had disappeared.  He was not available.  So I had to go and find out how to solve the problem.  Journalists were absent because some couldn't come to work.  There were staff problems.  And I had to deal with those issues.  I even had to call on people who were not working at the radio, as such, but who had -- how do you say this now?  Who were on -- on leave of absence, so to speak.  And I called on them to come and assist the others at the radio station.  I even called 
Radio France International on that very 11th.  I called a number of journalists as well to brief them on the situation.  

Then I went back home.  And upon returning home, I was told that I was expected to spend the night at the Hôtel des Diplomates because the situation had become serious and a vehicle was assigned to bring my family to the hotel.  It was not I myself who went to fetch my family.  And this was on Monday, the 11th of April.  So the security staff of the ministry went to get my family.  

So the first night I spent at the Hôtel des Diplomates was on the 11th.  Then on the morning of the 12th, I was taking my shower when I was told that the others had left and that I would be left behind.  I even ran out of the hotel without my belt.  I wore a pair of trousers without putting on my belt, because that is how things were.  It was -- it was total confusion.  We moved to Murambi.  So how can I spend a week or two weeks without a belt?  So somebody had to go to the Hôtel des Diplomates to fetch a belt for me.  

Mr. Prosecutor, I have told you everything.  I have told you everything.  And that is truly the truth. 
Q.	Thank you.  Your response was very clear and very detailed, and so we'll move on.

In Murambi where did you reside?  I'm sorry.  In Gitarama where did you reside?  
A.	In Murambi -- first of all, we did not know where we were going to live because there -- nothing had been prepared for us. 
Q.	To the extent that it's possible, just give a concise and direct answer to the question.  If I need more detail, I'll ask you for it.  Where the question is very simple, give a simple and direct answer.

Where did you live after the 12th of April when the government moved to Gitarama?  
A.	It is difficult to answer just like that, because your question is:  Where did I live?  Where did I stay?  That's your question.  And there were a number of rooms in Murambi.  And one could be in one room, and maybe that room would not be sufficient for my family which was made up of seven people. 
Q.	Let me simplify it for you.  Did you live in Murambi or did you live in Kabgayi?  Did you stay in Murambi with the other ministers or did you stay in Kabgayi?
A.	That is exactly what I was going to explain. 
Q.	Get directly to the point.  
A.	I was given accommodation in Kabgayi in the apartment which had been used by a doctor whose name was Kesyo (phonetic) who had gone back to Belgium.  So I lived in his apartment.  That is where I settled my family. 
Q.	Okay.  That was a very simple response and you could have given it five minutes ago.  Both you and the minister of defence resided in Kabgayi, whereas other ministers had rooms in Murambi, isn't that so? 
A.	I do not know where the minister of defence lived.  I started by telling you that I left my family in Murambi -- rather, in Kabgayi, but I had a room in Murambi.  That is what I was attempting to explain to you, but you didn't want to listen to me.  I hardly went back home.  But my family was in 
	Kesyo's house, and every now and then I would go there.  But most often I spent the night in Murambi. 
Q.	Thank you.  And would you agree that the interim government, your Abatabazi government, held 
	cabinet meetings on the average once every three days or so?  That you held regular cabinet meetings during the course of your -- your appointment between the 9th of April and the 14th of July when the government fled to Zaire? 
A.	I do not understand your question.  What do you want to know?  
Q.	Let me put it to you another way:  How often did the interim government meet in cabinet meetings? 
A.	Almost on a daily basis, particularly in Murambi, almost on a daily basis, or once every two days. 
Q.	And did you attend most of those meetings? 
A.	Not -- not most of them, almost all of them.  Whenever I was present, I generally attended the meetings.  I was almost always present at almost all the meetings. 
Q.	And would you agree that some of the meetings that were held by the members of cabinet included the leaders of the five political parties? 
A.	As far as I can recall, I do not see any council of ministers meeting which was attended by leaders of the political parties.  If that were to be the case, then such a meeting would not be referred to as a council of ministers meeting. 
Q.	What about meetings with military authorities?  Did the ministers as a cabinet meet with 
	military authorities? 
A.	Apart from the intrusion of Bagosora in the council of ministers meeting of the 16th of April, I am not aware of any other council meeting which was attended by soldiers.  And even when Bagosora came, we asked him to leave the room.  At that time we asked him in what capacity he had come into the council of ministers meeting, and he left. 
Q.	Did you take notes during these meetings? 
A.	Quite naturally. 
Q.	Well, we've seen the notes that you took for the meeting on the 9th and the 10th.  Are there other notes that you have of these almost daily meetings of the cabinet? 
A.	Well, the notes that I was able to recover were the notes of the two meetings that took place in Kigali.  But for the Murambi meetings, I was not able to recover the notes of those meetings because Murambi came under attack unexpectedly.  We were taken unawares and we had to vacate the premises in an unplanned manner or rather unexpectedly.  So I was not able to salvage or save any of my notes. 
Q.	So the only notes you have are the ones that we have seen in this courtroom, the handwritten notes of the 9th of April and the 10th of April? 
A.	I was able to collect some notes from the council of ministers meeting in Muramba, but I was not able to keep them when we were in the forests in Zaire.  Those notes were destroyed by harsh weather conditions.  The only manuscripts that I was able to recover are those of the two meetings of the 
	9th and 10th of April. 
Q.	The ones that support your testimony, the ones that you relied on to give your direct evidence, how did those manage to survive when all of the others disappeared? 
A.	God's grace, by God's grace, even my own survival, whereas most of my companions are dead. 
Q.	Well, how did they survive your arrest by the ICTR?  Our experience is that the notes and manuscripts of the various Accused are usually seized at the time of their arrest.  How did you manage to keep yours, and where were they kept so that they could survive for you to bring them into the courtroom? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I don't know -- I don't know whether you gave them any instructions, but I think that the police officers who arrested me were not under any obligation to seize all my property.  So the fact of the matter is that those notes were not seized or attached.  And if they didn't do so, it is not my fault.  So you should ask them why they did not collect those notes and my diplo -- my certificate.  I had it.  It was on me, but they didn't take it.  I still have my diploma.  I still have some documents on me which I had at the time that were not taken away, which were not seized. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I take note of the time.  And I can tell the Court that I had really hoped to conclude my examination by the end of today.  But looking at my outline, I don't think I've even covered a third yet.  

So I'll try to make progress tomorrow.  But it doesn't -- and I'm sure we'll finish tomorrow, but it's not going to be as short as I had anticipated.  So I'm just indicating to the Court my own disappointment.  I'm not going to exceed the time taken by Mr. Nimy.  That is certain.  But things are moving much slower than I anticipated. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.

We take our adjournment now. 
Mr. Witness, I remind you, as I do from time to time, that during any adjournment while you're on the stand you're not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.
(Court adjourned at 1532H)
