         4                    Sekule and Judge Guney. 

         5                    

         6                    We're here to bring before this court and 

         7                    to ask for a ruling on Mr. Kajelijeli's

         9                    of 1998.  In addition to his moving papers 

        10                    Mr. Kajelijeli would rely upon the sworn 

        11                    affidavit which sets forth the factual 

        12                    allegations contained in his original 

        13                    motion, which was presented to the court 

        14                    and to the prosecutor this morning. 

        15                    

        16                    We will also rely upon all unredacted 

        17                    witness statements presently on deposit 

        18                    with the registry that was used by Judge

        21                    

        22                    We'll also rely upon transcripts of all

        24                    we'd like to point out to the court that

         6                    Commissioner for Refugees while he was in 

         7                    Benin at the time of his arrest and to 

         8                    today's date Mr. Kajelijeli has not 

         9                    received the required documents from the 

        10                    prosecutor, although we did receive a 

        11                    communique from Mr. Webster on May 3rd 

        12                    indicating acknowledgment that he did, in 

        13                    fact, receive the letter requesting those 

        14                    documents. 

        15                    

        16                    That is relevant, your Honours, because 

        17                    the prosecutor, in their response brief, 

        18                    as this court is aware, argues, 

        19                    essentially, that Mr. Kajelijeli, in the 

        20                    first instance, was detained in Benin 

        21                    based upon the illegality of his status, 

        22                    and our contention, of course, is that is 

        23                    without merit as established by the 

        24                    evidence in this case.

         1                    Now, briefly, with respect to the facts of 

         2                    this case and what we are arguing as set 

         3                    forth in the affidavit. 

         4                    

         5                    Mr. Kajelijeli was arrested on June 5th of 

         6                    1998 in Benin.  The central thrust of Mr. 

         7                    Kajelijeli's complaint is that at the time 

         8                    that investigators for the tribunal went 

         9                    to Benin they did so based upon 

        10                    information that they had in their 

        11                    possession that Mr. Joseph Nzirorera, had, 

        12                    in fact, committed certain crimes within 

        13                    the jurisdiction of this tribunal.  They 

        14                    had no idea who Juvenal Kajelijeli was. 

        15                    

        16                    They, in fact, went to a residence that

        20                    had. They then found Mr. Kajelijeli in 

        21                    that residence.

        23                    They asked him, "Who are you?"

        24                    

        25                    He said, "I'm Juvenal Kajelijeli."

         5                    They had no information who this man was. 

         6                    They proceeded, based upon the fact that 

         7                    he was in the residence of Mr. Nzirorera, 

         8                    to have him put in custody.  That is the

        10                    There was no evidence, no probable cause

        12                    committed any crime, but he was, in fact, 

        13                    put in custody by the orders of

         1                    you can at least deal with this threshold 

         2                    question, whether there +know, has no 

         3                    merit and that is Juvenal Kajelijeli was 

         4                    in Benin and was illegally and was, in 

         5                    fact, detained because of his illegal 

         6                    status. 

         7                    

         8                    The document submitted by Mr. Kajelijeli, 

         9                    in fact, dispels that completely. 

        10                    

        11                    Now we go to the next question whether or 

        12                    not the letter that was submitted on June 

        13                    6 or June 16, whether that particular 

        14                    letter was false and the only way of 

        15                    testing the falsity of it is by the 

        16                    prosecutor's office showing by the 

        17                    confirming statements, by the supporting 

        18                    statements, that they presented to Judge 

        19                    Pillay to support whatever indictment they 

        20                    brought against Kajelijeli were there any 

        21                    witness statements taken that showed that 

        22                    as of June 6 or June 16 Kajelijeli had 

        23                    committed any crimes. 

        24                    

        25                    And I believe that if you look at the

         1                    evidence you will find that there isn't a 

         2                    scintilla of evidence to support that 

         3                    there was probable cause to issue this 

         4                    particular request under Rule 40 to detain 

         5                    Juvenal Kajelijeli. 

         6                    

         7                    We believe that this court should exercise 

         8                    its supervisory power to, in fact, look at 

         9                    the conduct that was, in fact, manifested 

        10                    here and we believe that it is not too far 

        11                    stretched as in the case of State versus 

        12                    Ibraham where the South African court, in 

        13                    fact, ruled in terms of fundamental 

        14                    fairness, where someone has been illegally 

        15                    brought into the jurisdiction that there 

        16                    should be some particular relief, because 

        17                    if there is no remedy that is available we 

        18                    end up with what, justice denied and this 

        19                    particular tribunal should not, in our 

        20                    view, countenance the abuse of process 

        21                    which the prosecutor's office, we believe, 

        22                    as shown by this particular document, 

        23                    manipulated or misused the process of the 

        24                    court at the defendant's expense.

         1                    Now with respect to the denial of right to 

         2                    counsel, in his affidavit at paragraphs 

         3                    1.2, 1.3 and 1.9 Mr. Kajelijeli was not 

         4                    provided with assistance of counsel at any 

         5                    time during his detention in Benin and 

         6                    certainly not when he came to Arusha and 

         7                    certainly not by the time of November 9, 

         8                    as attested by the fact he filed this pro 

         9                    se motion challenging his illegal arrest. 

        10                    

        11                    Mr. Kajelijeli was questioned, statements 

        12                    were taken from him, recordings were made 

        13                    of him, and the rules with respect to 

        14                    Rules 42 and 43, in particular, clearly 

        15                    state that if officials of the ICTR 

        16                    question and take tape recordings of a 

        17                    suspect counsel must be provided. 

        18                    

        19                    Counsel was never provided to Mr. 

        20                    Kajelijeli and that is unrebutted.

        22                    So we believe that there was a violation

         7                    that he was not informed, at any time, of 

         8                    the reasons for his arrest, even though he 

         9                    repeatedly asked those questions. 

        10                    

        11                    In the first instance on June 5th he was 

        12                    simply told, "You will find out later."  

        13                    He was not told later when he was 

        14                    questioned in July and he was not so 

        15                    informed within the meaning of the Statute 

        16                    when he was presented documents in a 

        17                    language which he did not understand. 

        18                    

        19                    The first time that Mr. Kajelijeli was, in 

        20                    fact, given a copy of an indictment which 

        21                    was unredacted as to him was in March, 

        22                    which was 270 days after his arrest and 

        23                    that document, I would like to show to 

        24                    this tribunal, was a document that was

         1                    document his name was written in, 

         2                    handwritten in, and that was the basis of 

         3                    the adjournment of the first appearance 

         4                    before this tribunal.  So Mr. Kajelijeli 

         5                    in September he was given a document 

         6                    completely redacted as to him.  We're not 

         7                    talking about it being redacted as to 

         8                    others, individuals who are still at 

         9                    large, it was redacted as to him on the 

        10                    face and with respect to every substantive 

        11                    paragraph identifying anything that he may 

        12                    have done or alleged to have done, that 

        13                    was redacted.  So, therefore, he was 

        14                    totally confused and registered his 

        15                    protestation that it was a document given 

        16                    to him and he, of course, couldn't see why 

        17                    he was being held, compounding his 

        18                    confusion, compounding his frustration, 

        19                    compounding his feelings that he was being 

        20                    illegally detained because there was no 

        21                    information.

        23                    We contend that it was a violation of

        11                    In this case at bar that you have before 

        12                    you Mr. Kajelijeli was held 150 days 

        13                    before being offered an opportunity and 

        14                    that was on March 5 and only after he pled 

        15                    guilty (sic) to the underlying charge. 

        16                    

        17                    There is no doubt about it at that time 

        18                    counsel asked for an adjournment, but it 

        19                    was after a 150 days that he had the first 

        20                    opportunity to present his case. 

        21

        23                    his right to an initial appearance without 

        24                    delay.

         1                    Rule 62, and Article 20,(4),(c) of the 

         2                    Statute guarantees the Accused a trial 

         3                    without undue delay.  Mr. Kajelijeli was 

         4                    transferred from Benin on September 9 to 

         5                    Arusha in the custody of the ICTR. 

         6                    He didn't make his first appearance before 

         7                    April 7 of 1998, a full 218 days. 

         8                    At the time of his transfer he was no 

         9                    longer a suspect and therefore he was not 

        10                    to be treated under Rule 40 bis, but he 

        11                    was now an Accused within the meaning of 

        12                    Rule 62, therefore the delay of 218 days 

        13                    was in breach of the requirement that he 

        14                    should be brought before a trial chamber 

        15                    without delay.  

        16                    

        17                    I refer the tribunal to Judge 

        18                    Shahabuddeen's separate opinion in the 

        19                    appeals chamber decision of November 3rd,

         1                    prosecutor for his comments and I'll 

         2                    request you to be very brief, as usual, 

         3                    because we have the written documents. 

         4                    Before you start, prosecutor, I would wish 

         5                    that for proper organization of the 

         6                    argument that you address some questions 

         7                    raised by the defence regarding the 

         8                    conditions of arrest.  The tribunal would 

         9                    also like to know, if in relation to Rule 

        10                    42, whether there were some, whether the 

        11                    suspect was interviewed, questioned.

        12     MR. WEBSTER:

        13                    I'll have to give a few corrections to 

        14                    factual matters that were raised by the 

        15                    defence attorney.  With respect to the 

        16                    letter dated 6th of June 1998 from the 

        17                    deputy prosecutor, Mr. Muna, the letter 

        18                    was drafted in French, the original 

        19                    version was drafted and served in French, 

        20                    I believe it was FAXed to the Ministry of 

        21                    Justice in Cotonou on that date and the 

        22                    English translation was filed with the 

        23                    registry on the 16th.  The English 

        24                    translation, I don't know when it was 

        25                    filed, but it was dated in error so when

         1                    Mr. Hinds refers to the 16th of June 

         2                    that's a error in translation, the letter 

         3                    was actually drafted on the 6th of June 

         4                    and FAXed on that date to the Ministry of 

         5                    Justice.

         7                    With respect to the document that Mr. 

         8                    Hinds refers to as elaborating or 

         9                    substantiating the refugee status of Mr. 

        10                    Kajelijeli, that document is an indication 

        11                    that an application for refugee status was 

        12                    received, it is not a document that 

        13                    purports to justify his immigration status 

        14                    or to designate him as a refugee, it 

        15                    simply states that he had given or 

        16                    submitted an application to the United 

        17                    Nations High Commission for Refugees. 

        18                    

        19                    I'm not going to systematically go through 

        20                    everything that needs to be said in 

        21                    response to this motion because I think 

        22                    it's amply made out, established in the 

        23                    written submissions, but in terms of 

        24                    submissions that Mr. Hinds has made that 

        25                    supplement his client's motions I'll

         1                    confine my comments to the following.  

         2                    

         3                    So the warrantless nature of the arrest, I 

         4                    don't think or I would submit that there's 

         5                    no basis to declare this arrest illegal 

         6                    because it was warrantless. 

         7                    

         8                    By the terms of Rule 40 the prosecutor can 

         9                    request a state to arrest a suspect in 

        10                    conditions of urgency, if there's an 

        11                    allegation that there's physical evidence 

        12                    that may be destroyed or actually let me 

        13                    read the rule itself into the record.  It 

        14                    states "In case of urgency the prosecutor 

        15                    may request any state to arrest the 

        16                    suspect and place him in custody, to seize 

        17                    all physical evidence and to take all 

        18                    necessary measures to prevent the escape 

        19                    of the suspect or an Accused injury or 

        20                    intimidation of a victim or witness or the 

        21                    destruction of evidence. 

        22                    

        23                    When the prosecutor answered or submitted 

        24                    a written response to the defence motion 

        25                    there was some mention of the irregular

         1                    immigration status of Kajelijeli. 

         2                    

         3                    When the arrest was effected upon the home 

         4                    of Joseph Nzirorera, Kajelijeli was there.  

         5                    He could not explain his status or his 

         6                    presence in the country.  He was taken 

         7                    into custody by the officials or the 

         8                    national officials of Benin and the 

         9                    following day there was a request from the 

        10                    deputy prosecutor that he be placed, be 

        11                    retained in custody because of allegations 

        12                    against him concerning the genocide in 

        13                    Rwanda and allegations of his involvement 

        14                    in criminal activity in Rwanda in 1994. 

        15                    

        16                    It's on the basis of the Rule 40 request 

        17                    that he was held in custody and that he 

        18                    was taken into custody.  He was arrested 

        19                    initially for one day, I think it was less 

        20                    than 24 hours by the authorities of Benin.  

        21                    I'd like simply like to remind the court 

        22                    that in any arrest of the suspect it is 

        23                    the national authorities that effects the 

        24                    arrest, it is the national authorities 

        25                    that determine the conditions of custody

        12                    against him, I would submit just in terms 

        13                    of the documentary proof that at a minimum 

        14                    he had to have been informed by November 

        15                    of 1998 when the prosecutor responded to 

        16                    his motion, he raised issues in his 

        17                    written motion, the prosecutor responded 

        18                    by attaching a letter or a copy of the 

        19                    letter from Mr. Muna which states quite 

        20                    unequivocally that Mr. Kajelijeli was 

        21                    suspected of participation in the genocide 

        22                    in Rwanda.  But even aside from that, even

         1                    would participate in an arrest without 

         2                    explaining their presence to the persons 

         3                    being arrested while they were recovering 

         4                    property, vouchering his property and 

         5                    while they were, in fact, conducting the 

         6                    arrest.  The letter from Mr. Muna on the 

         7                    6th of June states the basis of the arrest 

         8                    and I would submit that that information 

         9                    was communicated to Mr. Kajelijeli both by 

        10                    the national authorities of Benin and by 

        11                    the investigators of this office. 

        12                    

        13                    With respect to the denial of his right to 

        14                    counsel, I had a very lengthy conversation 

        15                    with a Mr. Preira of the registry 

        16                    yesterday and I inquired specifically of 

        17                    the attempts made to assign Mr. Kajelijeli 

        18                    with counsel. And I was informed by the 

        19                    registry that on the 28th of September, 

        20                    1998, that the registry had received a 

        21                    letter from Luke de Temmerman explaining 

        22                    that he was counsel for Kajelijeli and 

        23                    that for his expenses of representing Mr. 

        24                    Kajelijeli would be covered by the 

        25                    Accused's brother.

         2                    The next day the registry or 

         3                    representatives of the registry contacted 

         4                    Mr. Kajelijeli to confirm that he was, in 

         5                    fact, represented by Mr. Temmerman. 

         6                    

         7                    Mr. Kajelijeli did not confirm and the 

         8                    next communication that the registry had 

         9                    with Kajelijeli was on the 12th of 

        10                    October, 1998, when failing to receive any 

        11                    sort of documentation from Mr. De 

        12                    Temmerman they commenced the procedure of 

        13                    assigning counsel to Kajelijeli based upon 

        14                    the Accused's lack of responsiveness and 

        15                    not receiving any further substantiation 

        16                    from Mr. Temmerman.

        18                    Kajelijeli was given a short list of six  

        19                    names from which he could choose two. 

        20                    On the 15th of October, 1998 Mr. 

        21                    Kajelijeli replied and submitted two names 

        22                    but neither of the names that he submitted 

        23                    were on the short list that was provided 

        24                    to him and neither of the names that he

         3                    One of the attorneys that he requested was 

         4                    a Congolese attorney who could not be 

         5                    located by the registry.  The other was an 

         6                    American attorney who was able to be 

         7                    contacted by the registry.  There was a 

         8                    telephone conversation between that 

         9                    attorney and representatives of the 

        10                    registry, that attorney was instructed to 

        11                    submit some documentation, his CV and 

        12                    verification of his status as an attorney.  

        13                    That attorney never communicated with the 

        14                    registry. 

        15                    

        16                    The next communication was on the 12th 

        17                    November, 1998, where Mr. Kajelijeli to 

        18                    the Registry to explain that his Congolese 

        19                    attorney, the attorney that he had 

        20                    suggested, had left the country and could 

        21                    not be contacted.  And he submitted two 

        22                    additional names, one of Mr. Lishard, 

        23                    first name unknown, and the other of Mr. 

        24                    Hinds, who at that time were also not on 

        25                    any list established by the registry and

         2                    comprehensive list, so all the way through  

         3                    November of 1998 Mr. Kajelijeli was not 

         4                    cooperating with the efforts of the 

         5                    registry to provide him with counsel.

         7                    On the 2nd of December, 1998, Mr. Hinds 

         8                    was placed on the list of available 

         9                    attorneys and on the 8th of December, 1998  

        10                    Mr. Kajelijeli confirmed that he in fact 

        11                    would like Mr. Hinds to represent him but 

        12                    there were also other communications to 

        13                    establish if the two would be able to 

        14                    communicate with each other because of 

        15                    language difficulties, Mr. Hinds being an 

        16                    American attorney speaking English and Mr. 

        17                    Kajelijeli, I assume, speaking French and 

        18                    Kinyarwanda.  There was some documentation 

        19                    from Mr. Kajelijeli that he would have no 

        20                    problem communicating with Mr. Hinds if he 

        21                    was selected on the 22nd of December, 

        22                    excuse me, the request from the registry 

        23                    was on the 22nd of December, Mr. 

        24                    Kajelijeli did not respond until the 25th 

        25                    of January, so it wasn't until the second

         1                    of February, 1999, that Mr. Hinds was 

         2                    actually assigned to the Accused, but this 

         3                    delay in the assignment of counsel was 

         4                    really a product of Mr. Kajelijeli's lack 

         5                    of responsiveness and his determined, it 

         6                    seems resistance or refusal to cooperate 

         7                    with the procedures that were outlined for 

         8                    him.

        11                    such as defined in the Statute my 

        12                    understanding and my reading of the 

        13                    Statute is that the right to counsel 

        14                    attaches upon transfer to Arusha. 

        15                    

        16                    I base that submission on Rule 42 and Rule 

        17                    40 as well.  If we look at Rule 40(c) I 

        18                    believe it states that in the cases 

        19                    referred to in paragraph b, paragraph b 

        20                    addresses the issue of transfer from the 

        21                    place of arrest to the tribunal, to the 

        22                    seat of the tribunal or to another 

        23                    location, but in effect it addresses 

        24                    transfer from the place of arrest.  It 

        25                    states in the cases referred to in

         3                    rights provided for in Rule 42 and may 

         4                    apply for review to a trial chamber of the 

         5                    tribunal, the Chamber, after hearing the

        10                    to this Court is that by reading Rule 40 

        11                    in conjunction with Rule 42 there should 

        12                    be a -- on the basis of those two rules I 

        13                    would submit that the right to counsel 

        14                    only attaches upon the transfer to Arusha, 

        15                    and in this case that was the 9th of 

        16                    September and, as I just finished 

        17                    documenting, the Accused, himself, was a 

        18                    significant factor in his failure to be 

        19                    assigned counsel.

          6                   Excuse me, one second.  

          7                   

          8                   With respect to the allegation that the 

          9                   accused was denied the right of an initial 

         10                   appearance without delaying, I simply 

         11                   submit that initial appearances were 

         12                   scheduled for the accused on the 19th of 

         13                   October, 1998 and the 24th of November 

         14                   1998 and the 10th of March 1999 and on the 

         15                   7th and 8th of April, 1999.  

         16                   

         17                   I participated in the initial appearance 

         18                   on the 7th and 8th of April 1999.  The 

         19                   initial appearance on the 10th of March 

         20                   was postponed upon request from the 

         21                   accused's counsel because of alleged

         23                   which he was served.  And the two prior 

         24                   dates, as far as I could check with the 

         25                   Registry, appear on the calendar.  If

          1                   there was no Court sessions on those dates 

          2                   I am currently at a loss to explain why 

          3                   that was.  

          4                   

          5                   I conferred with the Registry -- 

          6                   representatives of the Registry to 

          7                   endeavour to find out exactly why the 

          8                   appearances that were scheduled on the 

          9                   19th of October and the 24th of November 

         10                   did not take place.  The explanation that 

         11                   was given to me was that problems in the 

         12                   assignment of counsel led the judicial 

         13                   calendar official to schedule initial 

         14                   appearances only for accused when they 

         15                   were actually assigned counsel.  

         16                   

         17                   This goes back to my arguments of a few 

         18                   minutes ago that the efforts or the 

         19                   resistance to the assignment of counsel by 

         20                   the accused themselves -- so on the basis 

         21                   of his own resistance to the assignment of 

         22                   counsel, that is a very -- that played a 

         23                   great role or that was a factor in the 

         24                   Registry's decision to or may have been a 

         25                   factor in the Registry's decision to

          1                   adjourn the initial appearances scheduled 

          2                   for the 19th of October and the 24th of 

          3                   November, 1998.   

          4                   

          5                   But even putting aside these efforts by 

          6                   the Registry to set a date for the initial 

          7                   appearance and without minimizing the 

          8                   importance of an initial appearance, I 

          9                   would like to offer the following 

         10                   submission to this Court:  

         11                   

         12                   The initial appearance of the arraignment 

         13                   of charges is a very important moment in 

         14                   the whole prosecution of an accused in a 

         15                   national jurisdiction.  I would submit to 

         16                   this Court that it is not as important in 

         17                   the context of an ad hoc international 

         18                   tribunal such as the International 

         19                   Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.  And I say 

         20                   that because the arraignment process, the 

         21                   initial appearance or what is likened to 

         22                   an arraignment, that an accused is 

         23                   assigned an attorney if he is indigent.  

         24                   

         25                   In the instant case, initiatives were

          1                   being taken to assign Mr. Kajelijeli 

          2                   counsel soon after he was transferred to 

          3                   Arusha.  It is also at the initial 

          4                   appearance or the arraignment on the 

          5                   charges that the accused is apprised of 

          6                   the nature of the charges against him.  

          7                   

          8                   In this case, Mr. Kajelijeli was served 

          9                   with a copy of the indictment against him 

         10                   when he was in Benin.   

         11                   

         12                   In terms of the initial appearance, again 

         13                   and the arraignment process in a national 

         14                   jurisdiction is to afford the Court the 

         15                   opportunity to supervise the conditions of 

         16                   his detention.  In the context of the 

         17                   ICTR, the Registry and representatives of 

         18                   the Registry are in constant contact with 

         19                   the accused.  If the accused had a 

         20                   grievance, he would be able to bring it 

         21                   before a Court by drafting a motion and 

         22                   submitting it, as he did in this case, by 

         23                   writing, to the President of the Tribunal, 

         24                   by telephoning the Registry -- there are 

         25                   many avenues that the accused can use to

          1                   bring complaints or grievances before the 

          2                   Tribunal, some of which he employed in the 

          3                   present, in the context of this 

          4                   indictment.   

          5                   

          6                   What the Registry informs is that any time 

          7                   the accused wants to contact the Registry 

          8                   he can indicate that desire to the 

          9                   commander of the detention unit.  The 

         10                   commander will submit the request that -- 

         11                   excuse me, one second -- and just to 

         12                   summarize it, all the guarantees and all 

         13                   of the procedures that are put in place 

         14                   during an arraignment in a national 

         15                   jurisdiction were already in place in the 

         16                   context of the procedures engaged by the 

         17                   Registry in this Tribunal with regard to 

         18                   Mr. Kajelijeli.   

         19                   

         20                   Now, I say that and I make that submission 

         21                   simply to underscore the fact that Mr. 

         22                   Kajelijeli's fundamental rights were 

         23                   respected.   But even in terms of 

         24                   scheduling the initial appearance, that is 

         25                   something that was done, in fact and I

          1                   would also add that the scheduling of the 

          2                   initial appearance is fundamentally the 

          3                   responsibility of the Registry.  The 

          4                   prosecutor does not play a role in 

          5                   scheduling the initial appearance.  It is 

          6                   the responsibility of the Registry.  I 

          7                   believe the Registry or I submit the 

          8                   Registry made significant efforts to 

          9                   schedule his initial appearance and even 

         10                   if that is not the case, the fundamental 

         11                   rights of Mr. Kajelijeli were respected 

         12                   because of other procedures that were in 

         13                   place to supervise the conditions of his 

         14                   detention and to inform him of the nature 

         15                   of the charges against him.   

         16                   

         17                   I would also state that the reason that 

         18                   the initial appearance is important, for 

         19                   purposes of informing the accused of the 

         20                   nature of the charges against him, is so 

         21                   that he can begin in the preparation of a 

         22                   defence.  I would submit to this Court 

         23                   that very early on in this procedure, as 

         24                   far back as August 31, when the indictment 

         25                   was confirmed and served upon him in

                                                         7 DECEMBER 1999
               KAJELIJELI

          1                   Benin, that he was acquainted or apprised 

          2                   of the nature of the charges that were 

          3                   pending and that he was not disadvantaged 

          4                   in any respect in beginning the process of 

          5                   putting together a defence.  So on the 

          6                   basis of all of those arguments, I would 

          7                   submit that there was no violation of his 

          8                   right to an initial appearance.

          9                   

         10                   I am not aware of any statements that were 

         11                   taken from Kajelijeli in the direct 

         12                   response to the questions raised by Judge 

         13                   Kama.  In the records that I have reviewed 

         14                   in the Office of the Prosecutor, there is 

         15                   no indication that a statement was taken 

         16                   or that a statement was tape-recorded.  

         17                   Common sense would sort of dictate that.  

         18                   I mean, it is just relying on common-sense 

         19                   notions of how persons interact.  There 

         20                   must have been some interaction between 

         21                   the investigators and the Office of the 

         22                   Prosecutor and Mr. Kajelijeli.  The 

         23                   investigators participated in the arrest, 

         24                   they did not lead the arrest but they were 

         25                   present.  It may have been words,

          1                   statements back and forth but there was 

          2                   nothing that resembled an interrogation 

          3                   that was tape-recorded for which a 

          4                   transcript was prepared or the Prosecutor 

          5                   is not in possession of any statements 

          6                   that we would use at trial against Mr. 

          7                   Kajelijeli.   

          8                   

          9                   So in terms of respecting his right to be 

         10                   free of custodial interrogation, that 

         11                   right was also respected.  The simple fact 

         12                   that there was no recorded statement or no 

         13                   transcript of statements that the 

         14                   Prosecutor intends to introduce as 

         15                   evidence, should clarify that particular 

         16                   point.  

         17                   

         18                   I mean the whole issue of safeguarding the 

         19                   rights of the accused to be free of 

         20                   custodial interrogation and informing him 

         21                   of his rights to an attorney and 

         22                   supervising the conditions of 

         23                   interrogation is so that the accused does 

         24                   not inculpate himself in a way that 

         25                   violates his fundamental rights.

          2                   If there is no statement and the 

          3                   Prosecutor makes a submission that no 

          4                   statements will be introduced against him, 

          5                   the whole issue of custodial interrogation 

          6                   is pushed to the side.

          7                   

          8                   I will simply summarize by stating that 

          9                   the accused herein was transferred 

         10                   pursuant to a warrant of arrest.  There 

         11                   was some discussion of warrant.  There 

         12                   was, in fact, a warrant.  A warrant was 

         13                   issued on the 31st of August 1998 after 

         14                   the indictment was confirmed.  It was on 

         15                   the basis of the warrant that he was 

         16                   transferred to Arusha.  His transfer, as 

         17                   indicated in his own motion papers, was on 

         18                   the 9th of September.   

         19                   

         20                   Even by the advocation of the most 

         21                   conservative guidelines in terms of timing 

         22                   of the accusatory instruments and so on 

         23                   and so forth - at this point I am 

         24                   referring to defence counsel's reference 

         25                   to the Baryagwiza Appeal decision where

          1                   the Court established that the 90 day 

          2                   maximum period is what has to be applied 

          3                   to any detention of the suspect before -- 

          4                   prior to the confirmation of an 

          5                   indictment.  

          6                   

          7                   If we look at the dates in question, his 

          8                   arrest on the 5th of June 1998, an 

          9                   indictment was in place as of the 29th of 

         10                   August 1998.  That is well within 90 days.  

         11                   At the most conservative argument, using 

         12                   the most conservative arguments that could 

         13                   be employed against the Prosecutor, the 

         14                   Prosecutor followed the indictment well 

         15                   within the time framework of 90 days.  

         16                   

         17                   Now, I am not suggesting that that is the 

         18                   appropriate time period to apply to this 

         19                   case.  But relying on the authorities 

         20                   cited by the defence, even by those 

         21                   authorities, the Prosecutor is well within 

         22                   the time constraints for filing the 

         23                   indictment and serving the accused with 

         24                   the indictment

          1                   Now, Mr. Hinds has raised quite a number - 

          2                   the same issue actually - quite a number 

          3                   of times.  And it all has to do with the 

          4                   integrity of the documents served on the 

          5                   accused.  

          6                   

          7                   I have carefully gone through the files of 

          8                   the Registry so far as the accusatory 

          9                   instrument is concerned and indeed there 

         10                   are several versions of the indictment.   

         11                   We reviewed this issue on the 10th of 

         12                   March when we attempted to have the 

         13                   initial appearance.  We revisited the 

         14                   issue at great length on the 7th and 8th 

         15                   of April.  I was present in this courtroom 

         16                   when we took the indictment, it was served 

         17                   on the confirming judge and unsealed it in 

         18                   the presence of a court officer to confirm 

         19                   the integrity of the original indictment 

         20                   that was served on the Confirming Judge 

         21                   and the indictment that Mr. Kajelijeli was 

         22                   served with.  And indictments are the same 

         23                   and Mr. Hinds was on the record, stated on 

         24                   the record that there was nothing 

         25                   irregular about the content of the

          1                   indictments that the accused received and 

          2                   that was submitted to the Confirming Judge

          3                   

          4                   With respect to the redactions, the 

          5                   redactions to the indictment were made 

          6                   upon order from the court.  They were made 

          7                   because persons that were also listed on 

          8                   the indictment, three of them, were not in 

          9                   custody at the time that Mr. Kajelijeli 

         10                   was in custody.  In fact four persons were 

         11                   not in custody at that time because Mr. 

         12                   Rwamakuba, who has been, who has come 

         13                   before this court, was not arrested at the 

         14                   same time as Mr. Kajelijeli, Mr. Karemera 

         15                   and Mr. Ngirumpatse.   

         16                   

         17                   I think we have gone over this issue of 

         18                   the redactions several times.  This is the 

         19                   third time I have been in Court and I have 

         20                   had to respond to the issue, to 

         21                   allegations of improprieties about the 

         22                   redactions and so on and so forth and I 

         23                   think that issue needs to be laid to rest.  

         24                   There is nothing irregular about the 

         25                   documents.  Mr. Kajelijeli was

          1                   appropriately informed of the nature of 

          2                   the charges that were pending against him 

          3                   and on that basis I would urge the Court 

          4                   not to rule against the Prosecutor on the 

          5                   basis of allegations of irregularity on 

          6                   the documents themselves.

          7                   

          8                   I would like to discuss one final point 

          9                   because it goes, it sets the historical 

         10                   context in which these arrests took place.  

         11                   I would simply like to remind the Court 

         12                   that back on the June 5th, 1998, when 

         13                   Mr. Kajelijeli was taken into custody, his 

         14                   arrest and the arrest of Joseph 

         15                   Nzirorera was one of a series of arrests 

         16                   that took place all across West Africa.  

         17                   There were arrests in Mali.  There were 

         18                   arrests in Cameroon.  There were arrests 

         19                   in Benin.  And these arrests were all part 

         20                   of a much larger investigation.  The plan 

         21                   and or the execution of the arrests, as 

         22                   they were planned by the Office of the 

         23                   Prosecutor was to have all of the arrests 

         24                   take place on the same date throughout 

         25                   various countries in West Africa.

          2                   Even if Mr. Kajelijeli was not an initial 

          3                   target for those arrests, the Office of 

          4                   the Prosecutor had done significant 

          5                   investigations on Mr. Nzirorera and his 

          6                   activities in Ruhengeri in organizing the 

          7                   killings and the genocide in Ruhengeri.  I 

          8                   have read a number of witness statements 

          9                   and every time there is a discussion of 

         10                   Mr. Nzirorera's activities, specific 

         11                   activities in Ruhengeri, there is also 

         12                   mention of Kajelijeli.  Kajelijeli did not 

         13                   just pop out of the air because we 

         14                   discovered him in Mr. Nzirorera's house.  

         15                   If he was Mr. Nzirorera's sidekick, that 

         16                   cannot be held against the Prosecutor.  

         17                   There are ample witness statements that 

         18                   document his involvement in the crimes and 

         19                   acts of violence and killings that took 

         20                   place in Rwanda in 1994 and it is on that 

         21                   basis that he was indicted.  

         22                   

         23                   No witness statements were ever handed up 

         24                   to the Court in order to confirm the 

         25                   indictment. The confirming judge was

          2                   materials which are extracts of witness 

          3                   statements.   

          4                   

          5                   Mr. Kajelijeli and his attorney have 

          6                   already been served with those extracts.  

          7                   It was served within 60 days of his 

          8                   initial appearance or I think it is 30 

          9                   days of his initial appearance as is 

         10                   required by Rule 66.  I have a receipt for 

         11                   the submission of those materials on the 

         12                   Registry.  I think Mr. Hinds has already 

         13                   made reference to those materials, so 

         14                   there is some acknowledgment that he has 

         15                   those materials in his possession.  But as 

         16                   far as witness statements are concerned 

         17                   there has been no disclosure in this case 

         18                   as of yet and the submissions of the 

         19                   Prosecutor to the confirming judge and any 

         20                   submissions by Mr. Hinds has to be based 

         21                   on the confirming materials and not on any 

         22                   witness statements.

         23                   

         24                   If you give me one moment to review the 

         25                   allegations of the defence attorney,

          1                   again, Your Honour, I will complete my 

          2                   statement and then surrender the floor.   

          3                   

          4                   I think all of the issues that were raised 

          5                   by the defence attorney and by Mr. 

          6                   Kajelijeli himself in his motion have been 

          7                   responded to adequately by the Prosecutor 

          8                   in these proceedings and in the written 

          9                   submissions that were made back in 

         10                   November when this motion was first raised 

         11                   or first submitted to the court.

         12                   

         13                   Again, I state that at a minimum, in terms 

         14                   of apprising Mr. Kajelijeli of the nature 

         15                   of the charges against him, by his own 

         16                   admission, had to have been done sometime 

         17                   by November since he bases his motion on 

         18                   documents that were submitted to him by 

         19                   the Prosecutor or served on him by the 

         20                   Prosecutor in spite of the fact that his 

         21                   initial appearance was sometime in April, 

         22                   or completed sometime in April of 1999.  

         23                   

         24                   On the basis of those representations and 

         25                   on the basis of the written material that

          1                   was submitted in this case, I would urge 

          2                   this Court to deny Mr. Kajelijeli or the 

          3                   defence motion in all respects and I thank 

          4                   you for your time and your patience.

         18                   but I feel compelled to respond to Mr. 

         19                   Webster's comments.  I am not sure whether 

         20                   or not Mr. Webster is saying to this Court 

         21                   --

         22    MR. PRESIDENT:  

         23                   (SOURCE LANGUAGE - FRENCH).

         24                   Mr. Hinds, I was telling you earlier that 

         25                   you are the applicant, once the Prosecutor

          1                   has responded, you have the floor as a 

          2                   matter of obligation, so I have no choice 

          3                   but to give you the floor.  It is an 

          4                   obligation, so you have the right to take 

          5                   the floor now.

          6    MR. HINDS:

          7                   (SOURCE LANGUAGE - ENGLISH).

          8                   Thank you very much, Your Honour.  Your 

          9                   Honour, I am not sure whether or not Mr. 

         10                   Webster is saying to this Tribunal that 

         11                   under Rule 40, there is no requirement of 

         12                   the Prosecutor's Office to have probable 

         13                   cause to have someone arrested.  I mean, 

         14                   is this what he is saying.  

         15                   

         16                   Now, I made two comments with respect to 

         17                   arrest; one, that it was warrantless but 

         18                   most importantly, it lacked probable 

         19                   cause.  That is fundamental in terms of 

         20                   internationally recognized standards of 

         21                   due process.  And we have not heard or Mr. 

         22                   Webster has not presented to this Tribunal 

         23                   one scintilla of evidence to establish 

         24                   probable cause.  What has he said.  He has 

         25                   said that the Prosecutor had information

          1                   about Mr. Kajelijeli and even if they 

          2                   didn't have information about him, this 

          3                   was part of a grand scheme to arrest a 

          4                   whole lot of people all over Africa.  This 

          5                   is unresponsive.   

          6                   

          7                   Did they, on June 6th of 1998, or on June 

          8                   5th of 1998, have evidence that would lead 

          9                   a reasonable person to believe that a 

         10                   crime was committed and that JuvTnal 

         11                   Kajelijeli committed that crime.  That is 

         12                   the basic understanding of probable cause 

         13                   in all jurisdictions, whether or not there 

         14                   was reasonable belief or enough evidence 

         15                   for a reasonable person to believe that a 

         16                   crime was committed.   

         17                   

         18                   What evidence has he presented?  Nothing.  

         19                   He simply makes a statement that the 

         20                   Prosecutor's Office had information and 

         21                   that they presented, sometime in August, 

         22                   information that in fact confirmed an 

         23                   indictment.  If that is so, all of the 

         24                   evidence that they obtained after Mr. 

         25                   Kajelijeli's illegal detention in June

          1                   should be suppressed under the landmark 

          2                   case of Wong-Sun versus United States, 

          3                   clearly fruits of a poisonous tree.  

          4                   

          5                   He has the burden, at this point, to come 

          6                   forward and to say Your Honours, this is 

          7                   the statement that my office had at that 

          8                   particular time.  This is the evidence we 

          9                   had.  You can not just simply arrest 

         10                   people based upon a notion that they might 

         11                   be a sidekick of somebody else.  That is 

         12                   not the standard that this Tribunal can 

         13                   accept.   

         14                   

         15                   Now, with respect to questioning, he did 

         16                   not deal with the question of whether or 

         17                   not Mr. Kajelijeli was questioned by staff 

         18                   investigators or agents of the ICTR.   

         19                   That was a straight question put by Judge 

         20                   Kama, the answer is yes or no.  He began 

         21                   to talk about tape recordings were not 

         22                   made and so on.  Well, did you question 

         23                   the man?  If you did, then look at Rule 40 

         24                   and 43.  

         25

          1                   Now, he is suggesting that the right to 

          2                   counsel does not attach when agents of the 

          3                   ICTR questions a suspect.  I mean that is 

          4                   amazing.  He says the right to counsel 

          5                   only attaches on this soil here, in 

          6                   Tanzania.  Amazing.  Is this the standard 

          7                   of this Tribunal that statements can be 

          8                   made, people can be questioned without a 

          9                   lawyer being present?  That is what I am 

         10                   hearing, unless there is something to the 

         11                   contrary.  

         12                   

         13                   The question is, was the man questioned, 

         14                   if the answer is yes, next question, did 

         15                   you provide counsel.  That is it.   

         16                   

         17                   Now, with respect to the first appearance, 

         18                   Mr. Webster makes the statement that the 

         19                   initial appearance is not important, as 

         20                   important, in this Tribunal, as it might 

         21                   be in a domestic forum.  I am amazed.  If

          5                   law.  That provision, Rule 62, is 

          6                   susceptible of the interpretation that 

          7                   non-compliance will result in loss of 

          8                   jurisdiction on the view that jurisdiction 

          9                   was granted by the Statute to the Tribunal 

         10                   subject to defeasance for non-observance 

         11                   of certain fundamental principles stated 

         12                   or implied by the Statute, one of which 

         13                   was later reflected in the provisions of 

         14                   the Rules.'

         17                   The Prosecutor's Office cannot decide that 

         18                   they are not going to abide by it.  These 

         19                   are the rules and not abiding to those 

         20                   rules makes their actions ultravires - 

         21                   beyond the law, unlawfully.  And this 

         22                   Tribunal must provide some remedy because 

         23                   without a remedy there is injustice.

          1                   asked the question, I was waiting for your 

          2                   answer to the complaint, yes or no, did 

          3                   you question the suspect.  You said well, 

          4                   there were conversations and really there 

          5                   was no questioning.  You were not quite 

          6                   clear on that question.  I would like to 

          7                   have your answer.

         10                   Thank you, Your Honour.  I will respond to 

         11                   your question to the best of my ability.

         12    MR. PRESIDENT:  

         13                   (SOURCE LANGUAGE - FRENCH).

         14                   Well, if you are not sure because you 

         15                   don't appear to be that sure about this 

         16                   matter, you can be given time to check 

         17                   whether there was some questioning or not.

         18    MR. WEBSTER:

         20                   On that, specific questioning is, that I 

         21                   am not aware of any questioning of the 

         22                   accused.  We can submit a response to that 

         23                   question in writing.  We can adjourn these 

         24                   proceedings and continue at a later time.

          1                   respect to the arrest of JuvTnal 

          2                   Kajelijeli, there is no indication in that 

          3                   file that he was questioned.  I was not 

          4                   present during his arrest, I can only base 

          5                   my representations to this court on the 

          6                   documentation of this case.  I premise my 

          7                   response simply by stating that it is 

          8                   common-sensical to assume that persons in 

          9                   the same room speak to each other.  I do 

         10                   not know, I am not aware of any 

         11                   interrogation of this accused or this 

         12                   suspect as he was back on the 5th of June 

         13                   1998.  

         14                   

         15                   I have the names of three investigators 

         16                   who participated in that arrest.  They are 

         17                   Gilbert Morisette, Martin Seutcheu and 

         18                   Robert Petit.  

         19                   

         20                   Prior to this hearing, last week, I made 

         21                   an attempt to contact each one of those 

         22                   three persons.  Gilbert Morisette was on 

         23                   mission, he was not available.  I believe 

         24                   he was somewhere in Europe.  Martin 

         25                   Seutcheu was also on mission, I believe he

          1                   was somewhere in West Africa.  Robert 

          2                   Petit is no longer in the employ of the 

          3                   Office of the Prosecutor.  I believe he is 

          4                   in Eastern Europe somewhere.  None of 

          5                   these three persons were available for me 

          6                   to ask them specifically what happened 

          7                   during the course of the arrest.  

          8                   

          9                   My submissions to this Court have been on 

         10                   the basis of documentation in the files of 

         11                   the Office of the Prosecutor and 

         12                   documentation in the files or those files 

         13                   that the Registry was willing to make 

         14                   available to me.  If you would like to 

         15                   adjourn this matter so that I can respond 

         16                   to your questions directly on the basis of 

         17                   questions that I would put to either of 

         18                   those three persons, it would be my 

         19                   pleasure to do that to further the ends of 

         20                   justice and so on and so forth.   

         21                   

         22                   I would however like to offer one or two 

         23                   additional comments to Mr. Hinds' 

         24                   response.  I am not aware that probable 

         25                   cause is an acceptable principle in

          1                   international jurisprudence.  There are 

          2                   guarantees of fundamental human rights in 

          3                   various conventions that were cited by the 

          4                   defence but by my understanding, which may 

          5                   be imperfect, the concept of probable 

          6                   cause has to do with -- it is a concept in 

          7                   American jurisprudence.  The case that Mr. 

          8                   Hinds cited is an American Supreme Court 

          9                   case.  I am not suggesting that it does 

         10                   not have persuasive influence for this 

         11                   Tribunal but it is not a binding concept 

         12                   in international criminal law.

         13                   

         14                   When I say that I am certainly not 

         15                   suggesting that there was no probable 

         16                   cause to arrest Kajelijeli but by the 

         17                   terms of the Statute, if we looked at the 

         18                   Rule 40 bis there is provision of 

         19                   extending his provisional detention on the 

         20                   basis of the investigation.  If there are 

         21                   provisions in the Statute to allow the 

         22                   Prosecutor an additional period of 30 days 

         23                   after his transfer, for the purposes of 

         24                   the investigation, it stands to reason 

         25                   that Rule 40 should provide a basis for an

          1                   arrest while an investigation is in 

          2                   course.   

          3                   

          4                   And when we look at these time parameters, 

          5                   what I would like to underscore to the 

          6                   Court is that the Office of the Prosecutor 

          7                   takes these time parameters in the rules 

          8                   themselves as a basis for guidance.  If an 

          9                   accusatory instrument had to be served on 

         10                   the accused or the suspect the day 

         11                   following his arrest or his detention, it 

         12                   would have been done.   My submission to 

         13                   this Court is if there was a requirement 

         14                   in the rules and if the Prosecutor was 

         15                   following procedures that were explicitly 

         16                   stated, that an accusatory instrument has 

         17                   to be filed within 24 hours, it would have 

         18                   been done.   Because the rulings 

         19                   themselves give us a wide -- wider 

         20                   timeframe with which to file documents.  

         21                   We took advantage of those facilities or 

         22                   those allowances within the rules and we 

         23                   filed our documents within the confines of 

         24                   the rules because we had that opportunity.   

         25                   But if there was a need, a legal need

          1                   demonstrated by the rules, the 

          2                   jurisprudence of this Tribunal, to file 

          3                   something within 24 hours, it would have 

          4                   been done in this case.

          5                   

          6                   And in terms of my submission of a few 

          7                   minutes ago, at no time did I suggest that 

          8                   an initial appearance is not important.  

          9                   Of course, it is important.  What I was 

         10                   simply attempting to address is the issue 

         11                   of the suspect's or the accused's 

         12                   fundamental rights.   The result of the 

         13                   Barayagwiza decision is that all of these 

         14                   responsibilities are placed at the 

         15                   doorstep of the Prosecutor which is not 

         16                   what was anticipated by the Rules of 

         17                   Procedure and Evidence.

         19                   The initial appearance is the 

         20                   responsibility of the Registry.  Serving 

         21                   an indictment on the accused in the 

         22                   language he understands is the 

         23                   responsibility of the Registry.   

         24                   Informing the accused of the charges 

         25                   pending against him is also the

          1                   responsibility of the Registry.  All of 

          2                   those elements that are integral to the 

          3                   arrest and the prosecution of this accused 

          4                   were the responsibilities of an 

          5                   independent organ of this Tribunal.   

          6                   

          7                   Now, by the terms of the Baryagwiza 

          8                   Appellate decision, all of the burden of 

          9                   those responsibilities are placed on the 

         10                   Prosecutor and I make my submissions in 

         11                   anticipation of the defences that would be 

         12                   raised, that were provided by that 

         13                   Appellate decision.  But in direct 

         14                   response to the questions or to the issue 

         15                   of this present hearing, I would submit 

         16                   that all of the rights of the accused or 

         17                   the suspect were respected.  He was 

         18                   indicted in a timely manner.  There is a 

         19                   prima facie case as established by the 

         20                   Confirming Judge for each and every 

         21                   element, each and every charge on the 

         22                   indictment and in every respect, the 

         23                   Prosecutor acted responsibly and fairly.

         24                   

         25                   There is one other thing.  Just as an

          1                   aside on the basis of Baryagwiza, I would 

          2                   simply like to conclude by stating that 

          3                   unlike a national jurisdiction, judgments 

          4                   of an appeals chamber are not binding on a 

          5                   trial chamber on another matter.  This 

          6                   Tribunal has to make its assessment of the 

          7                   facts of this case and apply the law to 

          8                   the facts of this case in an independent 

          9                   determination.  I would submit that 

         10                   Baryagwiza, the Appeals Chamber decision 

         11                   in Baryagwiza is binding upon any 

         12                   adjudication in the matter of Baryagwiza; 

         13                   it is not binding on this present Trial 

         14                   Chamber II.  But having said that I would 

         15                   still submit that the Prosecutor has not 

         16                   even violated the standards of Baryagwiza.  

         17                   And once again I thank you.

         18    MR. PRESIDENT:  

         19                   While defence has the right to take the 

         20                   floor last -- yes, you have something to 

         21                   add.

         22    MR. HINDS:

         23                   (SOURCE LANGUAGE - ENGLISH).

         24                   Yes, Your Honour.  Just briefly on one 

         25                   point that I forgot.  Mr. Webster made the

          1                   comment concerning the redacted, 

          2                   redactions in the indictment.  He is 

          3                   correct that initially in March and then 

          4                   in April, defence counsel for Mr. 

          5                   Kajelijeli raised the issue about the 

          6                   integrity of the indictment.  This was not 

          7                   the purpose for which I make this 

          8                   reference today.   Today I am only 

          9                   speaking on the question of notice and 

         10                   whether or not, when Mr. Kajelijeli was 

         11                   served a document with this amount of 

         12                   redactions including his name being 

         13                   redacted and any of the statements 

         14                   contained therein also redacted with 

         15                   respect to him, whether or not he was 

         16                   adequately informed.  That was the only 

         17                   reason why I was raising this, not to 

         18                   challenge the integrity of the 

         19                   documented --

         20    MR. PRESIDENT:

         21                   Judge Sekule has a question to put to Mr. 

         22                   Hinds.

         23    JUDGE SEKULE:  

         24                   (SOURCE LANGUAGE - ENGLISH).

         25                   Yes, in fact, Mr. Hinds has touched on

          1                   what I really wanted to ask him because I 

          2                   remember in the proceedings of either 10th 

          3                   March or 7th April, the aspect of the 

          4                   indictment, the intent of the indictment 

          5                   was gone into and I understand the defence 

          6                   as well as the other parties had 

          7                   opportunity to inspect the documents --

          8    MR. HINDS:

          9                   Absolutely.

         10    JUDGE SEKULE:

         11                   And this was resolved. 

         12    MR. HINDS:

         13                   Correct.

         14    JUDGE SEKULE:

         15                   So in fact I was also interested to know 

         16                   exactly the parameters of your argument 

         17                   today but I think with the clarification 

         18                   you have just made I understand.

         19    MR. HINDS:

         20                   Thank you.

         21    JUDGE SEKULE:  

         22                   Yes.

         23    MR. PRESIDENT:  

         24                   (SOURCE LANGUAGE - FRENCH).

         25                   Thank you, Judge Sekule.  We shall enter

          1                   into deliberation on this matter.  I wish 

          2                   to inform the parties that not having 

          3                   brought the Registry here today or 

          4                   referred to the Registry today but in the 

          5                   course of the deliberations the Chamber 

          6                   will be asking for some information from 

          7                   the Registry, firstly the reasons for the 

          8                   delay in assigning counsel and secondly 

          9                   the date on which the initial appearance 

         10                   took place and if there were any delays 

         11                   why such delays.   

         12                   

         13                   Another question is put to the Office of 

         14                   the Prosecutor and he will be answering, 

         15                   during the deliberations, the question is 

         16                   whether or not there was questioning, that 

         17                   is questioning of the accused.  

         18                   

         19                   So we will deliberate on this matter and 

         20                   on a day that will be communicated to 

         21                   these parties - because the Tribunal will 

         22                   have to deal with such matters before even 

         23                   arriving at the decision - I hope I have 

         24                   been understood by the parties.  We shall 

         25                   go into deliberations, a decision will be

          1                   handed down on a date that will be 

          2                   notified to the parties.

          5                   Your Honour, with the indulgence of the 

          6                   Court, depending upon the submissions made 

          7                   by the Prosecutor with respect to 

          8                   questioning, et cetera, the defendant 

          9                   would reserve the right to in fact submit 

         10                   either affidavits or in fact call 

         11                   witnesses because assuming, if the 

         12                   Prosecutor says there was no questioning 

         13                   and we now can produce witness who were 

         14                   there to contradict that, we certainly 

         15                   would want to be able to do that, before a 

         16                   decision is handed down.

         19                   Why not.  We want to have all the 

         20                   information, all the evidence on this 

         21                   matter.  I was even tempted to put the 

         22                   question to the accused himself, you know, 

         23                   about what happened.  Okay. Very well, we 

         24                   then will move into deliberations, 

         25                   judgment will be handed down on the date
