MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, and Judge Vagn Jøensen, is now sitting in open session, today, Tuesday, the 3rd of November 2009, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, case number ICTR-98-44-T.  

Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

The appearances are the same.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yesterday you took your oath to testify, and this morning your evidence will commence.  You respond to questions put to you by lawyers designated for that purpose starting, first of all, with Mr. Nimy, who will examine you on behalf of Joseph Nzirorera.  

Mr. Nimy. 
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
ÉPIMAQUE NSHIZIRUNGU,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued) 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	Is everything okay?  Are you okay? 
A.	I am well, thank you.  
Q.	Witness, you have an identification sheet before you; is that correct? 
A.	No, I don't.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. Issa, could you kindly hand over the identification sheet to the witness.  
MR. N'DOW:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I'm wondering whether we did not agree yesterday that the witness would not be protected, because I see the blinds are still shading him from the public.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Nimy.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, my understanding yesterday is that it was clear that the witness did not benefit from protection orders, so he is testifying in open session.  With respect to the curtains, I believe these have to be drawn -- pulled back.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. Registrar, could you assist, please.  
MR. NIMY:
Can I proceed, Mr. President? 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you have the identification sheet before you? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	I'm going to ask you to read it and to tell the Chamber if you have any corrections.  But I would like to really draw your attention to the fact that with respect to your date of birth, you easily note that there's a mistake.  Yes, there was a mistake.  It's a purely typographical mistake.  You have been said to have been born in 1052 (sic), and that is ages away.  As for the rest, please check if there are corrections which you would notify the Chamber of, then you sign close to any correction.  Do you understand? 
A.	Yes, I did, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness, after having read it and after having signed at the place where you have corrected the 
	date of birth, you can then date the PIS.  Today's the 3rd of November 2009, and sign it, please.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Nimy, as this is not a protected witness, you are at liberty to put his name on the record throughout his testimony.  
MR. NIMY:
As the Court pleases, Mr. President.  

Nshizirungu, Épimaque.  May I spell it?  N-S-H-I-Z-I-R-U-N-G-U.  Épimaque, É-P-I-M-A-Q-U-E.   

Mr. President, may I pray you to grant me leave to have the PIS admitted into evidence and 
under seal -- no, rather, just admitted into evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted in evidence, in open session.  
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. MJUI:
The document will be D. NZ664.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
	(Exhibit No. D. NZ664 admitted)  
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, I'm going to proceed with your examination-in-chief.  I would like you to speak slowly enough for the interpreters to understand you and interpret your testimony well.  Understood? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Also, I would like to ask -- request that when I finish asking a question, you should wait for the question to be interpreted before you answer it.  This is still to facilitate the interpretation.  I'm also going to try to do the same when you answer my questions.  

Witness, please tell the Chamber briefly what your educational background is.  
A.	In 1987 I was in primary school in the Busogo I centre.  And in 1990 I was in first year in 
	secondary school in the Busogo Saint Joseph College, known as ESTB.  
Q.	And with respect to this, in 1994 what were you doing? 
A.	Up till 1994, I was still a student. 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, where did you live? 
A.	I lived in Byangabo in my grandmother's house. 
Q.	How long had you been living there? 
A.	I had lived at my grandmother's house since birth. 
Q.	Witness, when you're talking about your grandmother, could you specify was this your paternal or your maternal grandmother.  
A.	I'm talking about my paternal grandmother.  
Q.	Witness, do you have any relation with Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	Nzirorera is my paternal uncle. 
Q.	Witness, could you be more specific? 
A.	Joseph Nzirorera is my paternal uncle because he is the older brother of my father. 
Q.	Hence the grandmother you are referring to and in whose house you were living is Nzirorera's mother; correct? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	Witness, were you in permanent residence there? 
A.	Yes, that is where I was found most of the time.  
Q.	And during the time when you lived there, did you -- were you in touch with Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	Yes, I used to see him. 
Q.	Witness, more specifically, where did you used to see him? 
A.	When he visited to enquire about our problems, I saw him on that occasion. 
Q.	When he was visiting you said, so Joseph Nzirorera did not live there; is that correct? 
A.	No, he didn't live there. 
Q.	Where did he live? 
A.	He lived in Kigali, as that is where he worked.  But he also had a house in Kinoni. 
Q.	Where is Kinoni? 
A.	It is a locality in the Mukingo commune, close to the commune office. 
Q.	Very well.  As far as you are aware or you can recall, how often did Nzirorera visit his mother's? 
A.	Before the 1990 war Nzirorera came almost every weekend.  But after the beginning of the war the number of times reduced. 
Q.	And what did you notice when Nzirorera visited at his mother's house? 
A.	When he arrived he discussed with his mother, who was my grandmother, and then he would ask us how we were doing and how things were going on in school.  And then he asked us if we had no problems or we did not have -- need school materials.  And I used to seize the chance to ask him for a bit of money.  
Q.	Were there other people, apart from yourself, who would come to your grandmother's when Nzirorera was there? 
A.	When members of the population learnt that he was visiting, some could come to ask him for jobs or to ask for his assistance in view of being admitted into schools -- for their children's education.  
Q.	Did you notice the arrival of figures of authorities when Nzirorera went -- visited his mother's house? 
A.	Could you specify the period you are referring to?  Are you talking about the period prior to the war or the period during the war? 
Q.	Witness, I -- I'm referring to all periods.  
A.	No, I did not see figures of authority visiting my grandmother's house during Nzirorera's visits.  
Q.	Could those authorities have come while you were not aware of it? 
A.	I feel that I would absolutely have been aware of those visits if they had taken place, as I am the one who usually opened the gate. 
Q.	More specifically, during the war did you see figures of authority at Nzirorera's mother's house? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, when one reads your PIS, you can clearly see that you were young.  So I would like to talk about the youth of Mukingo.  Did you notice the existence of a youth organisation in Mukingo? 
A.	Yes, there was a youth association that had a football team and which also carried out farming activities as they had a field somewhere in the commune.  
Q.	Did you, yourself, consult with those youth? 
A.	Often I was in the company of those youth because I used to help them to carry their shoes when they went for football training.  I could also carry balls when they went for practise.  
Q.	Is that all the youths did? 
A.	When they didn't go to play football or to do farming, most of the youths did small jobs, like porters or park boys, helping passengers to get into minibuses that took the passengers to various destinations.  
Q.	Witness, did you hear of Interahamwes in Mukingo? 
A.	Yes, I used to hear people saying that there were people or other people that were Interahamwe, but the truth is that those who were being referred to as Interahamwe, these were usually hoodlums or deserters who had deserted the army that was at the war front.  And there were others who were unemployed, idle people.  And these are people who were being -- who called themselves Interahamwe but who actually were not in the Interahamwe.  
Q.	Well, to use your own adjectives, those hoodlums, those unemployed idle persons, those deserters, did they have any distinctive features?  Were there any features that distinguished them? 
A.	There were some that I knew in the group.  I knew in particular Musafiri and Rwirasira.  And each -- they often had problems with the military police.  They would be arrested, released and then they would return.  And he always had -- or they always had military fatigues -- they always wore worn-out 
	military clothes. 
Q.	Didn't they have any uniform for the group? 
A.	No, he had his military attire.  I'm talking about Musafiri who had his military attire.  But he didn't have any other uniform.  He was always in that military attire.  
Q.	Didn't he used to wear clothes in kitenge fabric? 
A.	There are people who used to wear the kitenge tailored clothing and there are others who did not.  
Q.	What about those who wore such clothes, where did they find the fabric? 
A.	Some of them had enough money to be able to buy the fabric, whilst others didn't have enough money and so did not wear clothes tailored from the fabric. 
Q.	Did any of them -- or did they receive the fabric from Nzirorera? 
A.	Had those people received the fabric from Nzirorera, I must have had the fabric too because I was a member of the family, on top of that. 
Q.	In your home, Witness, were there any persons who had the fabric? 
A.	Apart from my elder brother who used to wear clothes made with the fabric, no other person wore it.  Besides, I do not know from where he had obtained the fabric. 
Q.	And those youth that you described a short while ago and who called themselves Interahamwe, did they receive any training prior to the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	Amongst the members of that group, one can say that there are some who had undergone training, because amongst them there were deserters.  Now, as to the group that I knew, during recruitment, that is, when the army staff was seeking to recruit youths, some of the youths did some tests and exams which included racing.  Well, if that is what you refer to as military training, yes, then that is what they did as part of the recruitment process.  
Q.	Witness, although the interpreters haven't complained, take your time and speak slowly so that everything that you say is well understood.  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Were weapons distributed to those youths? 
A.	I never saw them carrying weapons. 
Q.	My question to you was whether weapons were distributed to those youths -- distributed.  
A.	No. 
Q.	Why do you say so? 
A.	I'm saying this because I was often with those youths.  Most of the youths were my friends.  Consequently, they would have mentioned it to me had they been distributed weapons.  
Q.	Witness, do you know the Isimbi building? 
A.	Yes, I know that building.  That building belonged to my uncle's wife, that is, it belonged to 
	Nzirorera's wife.  
Q.	And what was the building used for? 
A.	There was a pharmacy in part of the building.  On another part of the building there was -- there was shopping -- or, rather a shop and there was another -- a book store on another part of the building.  
Q.	Who used to go to the building? 
A.	It's customers who used to come and buy their supplies from the store, such were the kinds of people who went to the building. 
Q.	Now, the young persons that you described sometime earlier and who called themselves Interahamwe, did they used to go to that building as well? 
A.	Since that building was located at the centre, when I saw them I didn't know whether they were going to that store or shop.  I, therefore, am not in a position to say whether they used to go to that building or not. 
Q.	Did they hold meetings, those youths, since you used to be in their company? 
A.	No meeting could be held at the building because there was no space for it. 
Q.	Is it Nzirorera who put that building at the disposal of all those who were seeking to use it? 
A.	I didn't quite understand your question. 
Q.	Witness, my question is as follows.  Was it Joseph Nzirorera who gave the building to those seeking to use it? 
A.	From what I understand, that building belonged to his wife.  And I don't see how he could have given people authorisation to use the building.  It would be to his wife that they would come to ask for permission to use the building.  I have never known whether it was Nzirorera who gave permission -- authorisation for the building to be used or whether it was his wife. 
Q.	Now, since you used to be in the company of -- since you consulted with these young guys that you described and about whom you spoke, did Nzirorera have any contacts with these youths? 
A.	I do not think that he had any contacts with them at any point in time.  
Q.	And how can you say so? 
A.	I am saying so because I was often with these youths.  I would be at home or we would be playing football.  And, therefore, they would mention -- they could have mentioned to me that they had met him.  I couldn't have failed to know had he had any contact with them.  
Q.	Witness, tell the Court where you were in the evening of the 6th of April 1994.  
A.	On the 6th I was at my grandmother's house. 
Q.	Apart from you who else was there on that date? 
A.	Nyirabutsitsi, Innocent, Vestine, Nyirabutsitsi's younger sister called Nyirabarera, Mukamusoni and Bagabo were also there. 
Q.	Witness, how did you learn about the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	At around 9 p.m. I was getting ready to go to bed and I wanted to take along the radio set in order to listen to music without my grandmother knowing about this.  And so in my room I switched on the radio in order to listen to the RTLM radio that usually played music.  And that is when I learnt that 
	President Habyarimana's plane might have been shot down.  And it was stated that more information was being awaited in order to confirm the news.  We were, therefore, invited to wait.  And when I heard that, I hurried to tell my grandmother what I had heard over the radio.  
Q.	After having announced the news to your grandmother, what did you do? 
A.	Well, we waited for confirmation of the news and we waited until 12 midnight.  
Q.	And after that? 
A.	At around midnight we all went to sleep.  
Q.	You say all of you.  
A.	Yes, I am saying all the persons -- all the people that were in the house went to sleep. 
Q.	And those are the persons that you named; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, indeed. 
Q.	And you slept up to what time in the morning? 
A.	I woke up at about 6 a.m. to listen to the morning broadcasts.  And I continued listening to the broadcast up until 7 a.m. 
Q.	Witness, between the time you all went to sleep and the time you woke up at 6 a.m., did any other persons come to your grandmother's house? 
A.	No, no one came.  
Q.	And what makes you say so, since you were sleeping? 
A.	Mr. Nimy, I believe that I have already told you that I am the one who had the keys of the gate in my custody.  And so I'm the person who would have opened the gate had anyone come to the house. 
Q.	Very well.  So you say you woke up at 6 a.m.; correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did you -- were you wearing watch to be able to tell the exact time? 
A.	Well, we were told what time it was.  If it was 7 o'clock or 8 o'clock the radio kept telling us what time it was at all times. 
Q.	Very well.  And when you woke up, what did you do? 
A.	I remained in bed up till 7 a.m.  I was waiting for my grandmother to wake up. 
Q.	And when your grandmother woke up, what happened? 
A.	When she woke up -- when she got out of bed she asked me to go and make a phone call to enquire about the news of her son.  She sent me to Baheza, Esdras because the telephone at home was out of order.  When I got to Baheza's place he was still in bed.  I asked his son to go and wake him up, and that is what he did.  If my recollection is not failing me, Mr. Baheza woke up, came to meet me and he had wrapped a bath towel around his waist.  He asked me what had happened and I asked him whether he hadn't heard the news to the effect that the plane of the president had been shot down.  And he asked me not to be joking with him -- not to be taunting him because we were not of the same age.  And I asked him that he should go and listen to the radio because the radio kept talking about the news and he didn't believe, ironically, that I was talking to him seriously.  He thought I was joking.  Well, subsequently, he said if the president's plane had, indeed, been shot down, then that would spell doom for all of us.  So he went back to his room, wore some clothes and then we went together towards a petrol station that wasn't far from there.  And there we were able to telephone -- or, rather, we were not able to telephone to make the telephone call.  And when we were unable to make that phone call, I returned home to tell my grandmother that we had been unable to make the phone call.
(Pages 1 to 8 by Rebecca McCoy)















0950H 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	So you were unable to telephone to Nzirorera; is that correct?  
A.	No, we did not -- we were unable to telephone because the telephone services were out of order.  
Q.	Now, when you returned to your grandmother's house to tell her about your failure to make the 
	phone call, what did you do thereafter? 
A.	I reached home at about 7:30 a.m. and told her that we had been unable to reach Joseph on the phone.  I continued to listen to the radio.  And between 8 and 8:30 a.m. I heard screams on the side of Byangabo and I went out running.  By the way, my grandmother had insulted me and asked me why I was leaving since I ran in order to see what was happening being a young person.  And once I got to Byangabo's (sic) house I realised that a person had already been killed, and it is Rukara who had been killed at the scene.  
Q.	From 6 a.m. -- or to the time that you went back to your mother's house to tell your grandmother that you had been unable to get in touch with Nzirorera by phone, and that you left your grandmother to go to Byangabo where you realised that Rukara had died, were any meetings held at Nzirorera's mother's house, from what you were able to observe? 
A.	No meeting was held there.  
Q.	Did you notice the arrival of any other visitors at your grandmother's house? 
A.	No one came there.  
Q.	Did you notice any movements of vehicles around your grandmother's house? 
A.	I didn't observe any.  
Q.	Witness, do you know Ephrem Setako?  
A.	Yes, I know him.  He is Lieutenant Colonel Setako.  
Q.	Did you see him that morning? 
A.	From the start of the war in 1990, I never saw him.  
Q.	Did you see him on the eve, that is, did you see him on the 6th at your grandmother's house? 
A.	I have just said that I had never seen him from the time the war started in 1990 and that includes the 6th of April.  So I didn't see him during that period.  
Q.	Do you know Kajelijeli? 
A.	Yes, that is the former bourgmestre of the Mukingo commune. 
Q.	Did you see him on that morning at Byangabo or at your grandmother's? 
A.	I didn't. 
Q.	Had you seen him on the eve at your grandmother's? 
A.	No, I hadn't.  
Q.	Witness, did you know Augustin Bizimungu? 
A.	Yes, I do.  
Q.	Do you know Nyabusore, Jean-Baptiste? 
A.	Yes, I know that he was the director of the higher institute of Busogo.  
Q.	Do you know Niyoyita, Jean Damascéne? 
A.	I know him as well.  He was a schools inspector in Busogo 
Q.	Did you see them that morning? 
A.	I saw none of the people you have referred to.  
Q.	And on the previous -- on the eve they weren't there, were they? 
A.	No, none of those people were at my grandmother's.  
Q.	Let me finish by Ndisetse.  Did you see him that morning? 
A.	Yes, I saw Ndisetse at Byangabo centre.  And as a matter of fact, I went close to him.  I noticed that he was talking to **********************, and his group telling them that they were going to pay for what they had done -- they had just done.  So that was the group that was committing the massacres.  And I would like to state that when I saw Ndisetse, Rukara had already been killed.  
Q.	Witness, were there weapons that had been stockpiled in your grandmother's house? 
A.	No, there were no weapons in my grandmother's house.  
Q.	You -- how come you assert that with such certainty? 
A.	Counsel Nimy, I knew every nook and cranny of my grandmother's house.  And even when I wanted to look for some loose change to go and buy donuts or ice cream, I would search the house, every nook and cranny of the house, and if there had been a weapon in there, I would have found it.  
Q.	Witness, let us come back to Ndisetse.  How did he stop people from killing? 
A.	He did not have weapons and he had no other means.  So the only thing he could have used was speech, and he was verbally warning them, telling them that they were going to have to be answerable for what they were doing.  
Q.	And after Rukara's death, Mr. Witness, what happened subsequently?  Could you tell the Chamber in brief what happened -- how things happened afterwards.  
A.	After Rukara's death that group of people continued the search for Tutsis beginning with the family of one Keyosi, and they carried on to Ruhengeri where there was a lot of Tutsis.  After Ruhengeri the Tutsis moved into a little wood and the assailants chased them in there.  
Q.	Witness, once more, I would like to come to the rescue of the interpreters although they are not protesting yet.  Please slow down.  Slow down your speech.  You have time; take your time to allow proper interpretation of what you are saying.  Go slowly, but surely.  Understood? 
A.	I understand.  As I just said a while ago, after Rukara's death the assailants continued to chase the Tutsis.  They went to one Keyosi's house, who was a Tutsi, and he lived near the Byangabo centre.  When they arrived at his house, they destroyed his house and then they went to Rwankeri where there were a lot of Tutsis.  When they arrived in Rwankeri they also demolished houses but the Tutsis had moved away into a wood that was not far away from them.  They had moved away alongside their livestock and some of those Tutsis even had spears and sticks, as well as bows.  They carried on as the Tutsis defended themselves by throwing stones and spears, but one of the assailants arrived with a grenade which he threw and missed those Tutsis and one of the Tutsis was wounded.  In spite of that, the Tutsi carried -- continued to defend themselves.  And, subsequently, Musafiri arrived with a firearm.  And when the firearm arrived (sic) the Tutsi were no longer able to resist.  After that massacre one of the Tutsis was able to escape by running away towards the Busogo parish.  The assailants chased him.  And when he noticed that those assailants were on his heels, he entered the convent.  When he arrived there he found other Tutsis who were -- had sought refuge at the convent and who were in the rooms.  The assailants then began to break in the windows of the convent, and Musafiri with his firearm continued what he was doing.  

There was a reverend sister who was Belgian who got beaten up by the assailants who said that her sisters were the source of the problems that they were facing.  One of the assailants threw a grenade into the convent, and that grenade wounded even one of the assailants as well.  

Amongst the assailants, allow me to specify that you had displaced persons and refugees who were coming from Byumba, some others from Kinigi.  So that continued.  And after that massacre the assailants began to loot property belonging to the convent.  I think that they even attacked the CARITAS house where they stole milk and which they sold subsequently.  
Q.	Witness, those people who did all those things you have just described, who did they get their orders from? 
A.	I believe no one gave them the orders to do so.  They were just behaving like mad people, like people who were on drugs.  When they heard about the death of Habyarimana -- 
President Habyarimana's death, they just did that on their own.  
Q.	Very well.  Now, after you had witnessed all those events you just described, what did you do? 
A.	After having witnessed all those events around 3 or maybe 4 p.m. I returned home.  
Q.	And you stayed there until when? 
A.	I stayed home till the next day.  
Q.	That is -- the next day, which is the 8th, correct? 
A.	Correct.  
Q.	And the following day, the 8th, that is, what did you do? 
A.	On the 8th of April the assailants began to chase the Tutsis.  Indeed, they went to the Nkuli commune in search of Tutsi.  But, as a matter of fact, they were not after Tutsis only, at the same time they were looting the property, domestic belongings and even livestock.  
Q.	Did you go along with them?
A.	When they went to the Nkuli commune, I didn't go along with them.  But when they looted, we easily heard about it because they came and sold what they had looted at the Byangabo centre.  
Q.	Very well.  Witness, did you personally get to accompany all these youths, these people, these troublemakers you just described?  Did you get to accompany them on other occasions? 
A.	I believe I accompanied them twice.  I accompanied them when they went to the 
	Ruhengeri court of appeals building and I also accompanied them when they went to the 
	Nyakinama commune.  
Q.	Okay.  Let us focus a little bit at the Ruhengeri appeals court.  When was that, Witness? 
A.	We went to the Ruhengeri appeals court one week after the Byangabo events.  
Q.	What exactly happened at the Ruhengeri appeals court, Mr. Witness, could you tell the Chamber? 
A.	People came from Ruhengeri on board little trucks and they said that Inkotanyi and Tutsi had sought refuge in the Ruhengeri appeals court and that there were gendarmes who were also found there.  
	In other words, those people had come to ask for reinforcements.  And when we arrived, we noticed that there were lots of people and even bouncers.  We immediately took two pickups that they had come to load Irish potatoes and those are the vehicles that escorted the assailants to the 
	Ruhengeri appeals court.  At that place you had about six gendarmes who were in charge of the security of the refugees.  And since among the assailants you had people such as Musafiri, who was also armed, the gendarmes fired into the air to try to scare off the assailants.  But when they noticed that the assailants were more numerous the gendarmes ran -- withdrew.  So the assailants went into the courtyard of the Ruhengeri appeals while the driver and I went to the centre of Ruhengeri, and on the way we met the gendarmerie patrol.  

Allow me to specify that I was found with a driver who was called Rumacya.  So when we met that gendarmerie patrol, it stopped us and searched our vehicle, and the gendarmes seized a grenade from one Gato.  They also seized a club on Rumacya.  After that the gendarmes led us to prison and put us -- and detained us.  

When the other members of the public learnt about our arrest, they came to the brigade to free us.  They threatened the gendarmes who were on guard that if they did not free us, then they were going to demolish the buildings of the brigade.  The assailants, therefore, surrounded the buildings of the brigade and started to throw stones and to fire into the air.  

When the gendarmes realised that they were not enough in number and that they could be beaten, they freed us, and we boarded a vehicle and returned to our homes.  But while we were on the way home, assailants were saying that there were other areas where Tutsis had sought refuge or were in hiding.  
Q.	Witness, let me come back to -- to focus on your release.  Who did you say released you? 
A.	It was a mob of people which came and was throwing stones on the buildings of the brigade, saying that if the gendarmes did not release us, then the brigade buildings were going to be demolished.  And when the gendarmes who were understaffed realised that they could not resist, they decided to release us -- to free us.  
Q.	That is the reason why you were released, correct? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  
Q.	Very well.  After you were released, what happened? 
A.	We returned.  And when we arrived at Byangabo centre, I immediately went home because members of our group had said that the following day they were going to continue the operation at another place, so we waited for the next day.  
Q.	And the following day, did you meet with those people for further operations? 
A.	Yes, indeed, the following day I once more followed the group and this time around we went to Nyakinama.  Before we arrived at the Ruhengeri city centre soldiers who were protecting the hospital posted themselves across the road and threatened to confront us.  And some members of our group asked the soldiers why they were blocking our way while we were going to Nyakinama.  When the soldiers learned that we were going to Nyakinama, they said that we could carry on our journey, and they said that we -- they were blocking our way because they thought we were going to massacre the Tutsis who were found in the hospital.  So we boarded our vehicles and carried on to Nyakinama where they continued to chase Tutsis.  

In the meantime, General Bizimungu arrived before the assailants had killed even one Tutsi.  
General Bizimungu said to the members of the group that if he were to see a member of that group after five minutes, he was going to act.  So we boarded vehicles and went back.  And on the way we met a colonel who was in charge of operations in the Ruhengeri secteur, and that is 
Colonel Bivugabagabo.  He arrested us and told us -- he stopped us and told us that he could not fight both in the mountainous areas and then come and fight in the interior.  And he said that if anybody wanted to fight, then all he had to do was to ask for a gun and go to the front and that he no longer wanted to hear about incidents.  And then he let us go, warning us that he no longer wanted to hear about our operations.  

And as we could no longer carry on our operations, some of the truants whom I referred to previously, conducted the operations in solitary.  Rumacya went to Gatovu to go and steal -- and rustle cattle.  And when people chased him, he tried to throw a grenade, but as he was high on drugs, he fell on his grenade which had not yet exploded and the soldiers found him there and killed him.  

And, subsequently, they sent a message to the conseiller telling him to send people to come and collect Rumacya's corpse.  And when the conseiller heard that piece of information he seized an opportunity to address people who were there, telling them that at that time they could see the direct consequences of the acts that he had always condemned.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  

Witness, you have just talked about General Bizimungu, who, in his own way, intervened in this incident of Lieutenant Colonel Bivugabagabo.  Did you hear of Nzirorera in this matter? 
A.	I never heard anything about Nzirorera.  He always condemned these acts, these massacres.  With regard to comments made by others, no one made comment with respect to Nzirorera.  All I know is that Bizimungu and the others condemned those acts of violence.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, I would like to ask you a different type of question.  You stated that you knew Kajelijeli, correct? 
A.	Yes, I do.  
Q.	When Kajelijeli took oath of office as bourgmestre, were you aware of it? 
A.	Yes, I heard about it, and, as a matter of fact, I attended the ceremony.  
Q.	Oh, so you were present? 
A.	Yes, indeed, I was.  
Q.	When was that? 
A.	I no longer recall the exact date, but it was in June.  
Q.	Indeed, it was the 14th of June.  

Witness, as far as you can remember, could you describe to the Chamber how that ceremony was conducted? 
A.	I was still young at the time, and so we had to stand in a line to welcome the visitors.  And, personally, I had to hide so that my uncle wouldn't see me, but that did not stop me from seeing what was happening.  So I went to the place where the ceremony was taking place to see what was happening there.  
Q.	Could you describe to the Chamber what the atmosphere was like during the ceremony? 
A.	You had traditional dance groups which were performing, people were dancing.  You had ballets.  
Q.	Yes, please proceed.  
A.	There was also a march-past and the Amahindure group marched.  That is all I saw.  
Q.	Was Joseph Nzirorera present at that ceremony? 
A.	Yes, he was.  
Q.	Did he take the floor during that ceremony? 
A.	No, he did not take the floor at the ceremony.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, it is 10:30.  Would you direct that we take the break now?  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
How much longer will you need? 
MR. NIMY:
Three minutes.  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, it's 10:26, according to my watch.  Couldn't you complete before the break then, or do you especially want to take the break and then do the --
MR. NIMY:
We would rather we took the break now, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:  
All right.  We take the mid-morning break now for about 15 minutes.  
(Court recessed from 1027H to 1052H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Nimy. 
MR. NIMY:
I am obliged, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, when you were in the company of all these persons that you described, for instance, who went to the court of appeal in Nyakinama, et cetera, how were you -- you accompanied them in what capacity as a young inquisitive man or as a member of their organisation? 
A.	Well, I used to have pleasure to enter the vehicle, and then it was out of curiosity that I accompanied them because I was young.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, that brings me to the end of my examination-in-chief.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Do any other Defence teams have any questions to put to this witness? 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I have no questions for this witness.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, the Defence team for Mathieu Ngirumpatse does not have any questions for this witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Now, Mr. Witness, you have to respond to the Prosecutor, who will now commence cross-examining you.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Your Honours, the entire examination-in-chief lasted 1 hour 20 minutes.  Thank you.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MR. SENDZE:
Good morning, Mr. President, Honourable Judges, Defence teams and every other person in 
the courtroom.  For the record, my name is Takeh Sendze, an attorney attached to the 
Office of the Prosecutor, and I will be cross-examining the witness on behalf of the Prosecutor. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SENDZE:  
Q.	Mr. Witness, it is on the record that your name is Épimaque Nshizirungu.  But I want to confirm that you were also popularly known as Muhumbo; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, apparently, it is Congolese who lived in Byangabo neighbourhood who nicknamed me as Muhumbo.  That is how I came about to be going by that nickname.
Q.	And Muhumbo is spelt M-U-H-U-M-B-O, is that correct? 
A.	It is spelt Mu -- Muhumbo is spelt M-U-H-U-M-B-O. 
Q.	Thank you.  And you do confirm that you are Mr. Nzirorera's nephew? 
A.	Yes, I do confirm that.  
Q.	You were 11 years old in April 1994; is that correct? 
A.	That's correct.  
Q.	And you have testified before this Court that from the time you were born you lived at Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house, confirm? 
A.	That's correct.  
Q.	Could you tell the Court if Mr. Nzirorera's mother was employed at the time you lived at that house? 
A.	My grandmother was a farmer.  She was also a livestock rearer, but she didn't have any other specific occupation.  
Q.	So it would be correct to say it is Mr. Nzirorera who supported this household financially, correct? 
A.	My grandmother had lots of fields which she farmed.  As a matter of fact, we supplied the city of Kigali using trucks.  It doesn't imply that Nzirorera did not assist us.  He would come and ask us about the problems that we had, especially with regard to school needs.  I am talking about school needs; money, and that is when I would ask for pocket money to buy ice cream, and I would ask for money for other little needs.  
(Pages 9 to 16 by Sithembiso Moyo)







1100H 
BY MR. SENDZE:  
Q.	Okay.  So he gave you pocket money once in a while to take care of your school needs.  Who sponsored you in school?  
A.	When he visited he would give -- would give me school fees, and when he was not available my grandmother was the one who paid my school fees.  
Q.	Okay.  So you lived in that house basically as a son in the family.  You could be considered a child of that house; is that correct?  
A.	Correct.  
Q.	And you -- it would not be unfair to say that your wellbeing at that time depended exclusively on Nzirorera's direct family.  Correct?  
A.	Yes, correct.  
Q.	Okay.  Now, let's talk about the Interahamwe.  Do you agree that the term "Interahamwe" referred to the MRND youth wing in Rwanda?  
A.	With respect to the word "Interahamwe", I have a completely different position.  "Interahamwe" -- what it means in -- literally speaking, is "people who come together".  Even within a cooperative movement, people could have put -- been -- come together and referred to themselves as "Interahamwe".  
Q.	Witness, was the youth wing of the MRND referred to as "the Interahamwe"?  Yes or no?  
A.	Yes, they were called "Interahamwe", but these were the Interahamwe of Kigali, not the Interahamwe of Mukingo.  
Q.	Are you testifying before this Court that the Interahamwe, as the youth wing of the MRND, did not exist in Mukingo?  
A.	As I stated previously, the Interahamwe did not exist in Mukingo.  There were people who referred to themselves as "Interahamwe", and among them you had deserters, you had truants, and farmers.  So that is -- that group called itself "Interahamwe", but we cannot call them -- we cannot say that the Interahamwe indeed existed in Mukingo.  
Q.	Were you amongst those who called themselves "Interahamwe" in Mukingo?  
A.	I was a young child who was curious to see what was happening.  I would share sugar canes with that group of people and many things.  But I was not an Interahamwe. 
Q.	But were you one of those who was considered to be an Interahamwe? 
A.	I would accompany them, but as -- as youth.  Otherwise I didn't understand the meaning of "Interahamwe".  I just accompanied them out of curiosity, as the way youth -- they were young and I was young. 
Q.	Could you name a few of those people you recall who were commonly referred to as "Interahamwe" in Mukingo?  
A.	I would recall ********************************.  You have my older brother who was a deserter from the army.  You had also Musafiri who is -- was also a deserter from the army.  You have Kwitonda, who had been nicknamed Sesera.  You have *****************************.  Those are the names I remember. 
Q.	Who is this, your brother you keep talking about?  
A.	He's -- his name is Noël Ndayisabye. 
Q.	Okay.  Witness, I want to inform you that one of those you have mentioned listed you as a member of this group that was referred to as the Interahamwe.  
MR. SENDZE:  
And I would refer the Court to Exhibit P. 356.  It is not in the bundle; I am just referring it to for the record.  
BY MR. SENDZE:  
Q.	Do you have any comment?  
A.	Listen, if somebody had me appear on that list, then maybe it was because I usually accompanied them and I was present during their activities, and that is the reason why they may have listed me with that group.  
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, have you ever written a letter before in your life?  
A.	A letter?  Under what circumstances?  I don't follow.  
Q.	Any under circumstances -- any -- under any circumstances.  Have you ever written a letter to anyone?  
A.	Well, where I live I write letters.  Otherwise, before when I was in Rwanda, I had no need to write letters.  
Q.	Would you write a letter to somebody who does not exist?  
A.	Except somebody who was mad.  I don't know if I can say I can write a letter to somebody who is dead -- who does not exist.  
Q.	Okay.  Witness, do you know a man called Dr. Casimir Bizimungu, who was the MRND chairman in Ruhengeri préfecture in 1992?  
A.	Are you referring to Minister Bizimungu?  
Q.	Yes, he was a minister at one time.  
A.	I believe I remember that person. 
Q.	And you agree that he was a member of the MRND, and I am also putting to you that he was the chairman of the MRND in Ruhengeri in 1992.  

Now, bearing those facts in mind, would you agree that, given his position within the MRND and in Ruhengeri, he is well placed to know whether or not the Interahamwe was established or existed in Ruhengeri?  Do you agree?  
A.	You could ask him that.  I didn't know all -- every part of Ruhengeri.  You're asking me about events in Mukingo.  But I will confirm that in Mukingo there was no Interahamwe, unless -- except for the people who claimed the name "Interahamwe" while they were truants, and you are insisting.  I don't know why you are insisting on the fact that there were Interahamwe in Mukingo. 
Q.	Witness, I am just asking you whether you would think that a man like Bizimungu would be well placed to know whether the Interahamwe existed in Ruhengeri.  Mukingo is in Ruhengeri.  So, please, answer the question directly, a yes or no.  
A.	He's best placed to know, not I. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. SENDZE: 
At this time I would refer the Court and the parties to page 8 of my bundle for the English, and page 12 of the bundle for the French.  This is Exhibit P. 368 in this trial, and it is a letter from Dr. Casimir Bizimungu to the minister of the interior, and it is dated the 28th of October 1992.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, just as a minor correction, in my bundle the English copy is page 11.  Page 8 was a Kinyarwanda copy.  
MR. SENDZE: 
That's correct, Mr. President.  Thank you.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Now, Witness, you have -- this is a letter written by Dr. Casimir Bizimungu.  
A.	Could you indicate the page to me once more, please.  
Q.	Sorry, for -- page 8 for the Kinyarwanda version.  The numbering is on the top right-hand corner.  

So, I was saying this is a letter from Dr. Casimir Bizimungu in which it discusses certain matters.  And if you look at the bottom of the document, you would see that Dr. Casimir Bizimungu addressed -- wrote the letter and copied Interahamwe presidents in all communes of Ruhengeri.  Do you see that?  
A.	No, I can't see it.  I -- I'm lost.  
Q.	Look at the bottom of the document on page 8. 
A.	Yes, I can see it.  
Q.	So, now, bearing in mind what you just told this Court, that a person would only be mad to address a letter to somebody who did not exist, and being faced with this letter from Dr. Casimir Bizimungu, whom you would agree with me was not mad at the time, do you still insist that there was no way that the Interahamwe existed in Ruhengeri and its communes?  
A.	Do you know the number of communes in the Ruhengeri préfecture?  Now, when you are saying "Ruhengeri", I can't tell which area you are referring to.  Are you talking about Mukingo or elsewhere?  I believe that you can ask me questions on Mukingo commune and not the entire Ruhengeri préfecture.  I was a young child, I didn't know, and I didn't follow -- listen to what was -- monitor what was happening to Interahamwe in the préfecture.  
Q.	Okay, we will move on.  

You have also testified before this Court that you know Mr. Juvénal Kajelijeli.  Is that correct?  He was the MRND bourgmestre of Ruhengeri in 1992, and subsequently 1994.  You do know him, don't you?  
A.	Yes, I know him.  
Q.	You also agree that, given his status within the MRND, and this time in Mukingo, he is better placed to know whether or not the Interahamwe existed in Mukingo.  
A.	Yes, but you would be better off asking him, not me.
MR. SENDZE:
Now, I would direct the Court to pages 1 to 3 of my bundle, which is -- that is in French, and pages 4 to 7 of my bundle in English.  For the record, this is Mr. Juvénal Kajelijeli's testimony in his own trial on the 17th of April 2003.  And I would invite the Court and the parties, including the witness, to address their minds to page 3 of my bundle, line 6 to 17 in the French; and page 6 of my bundle, line 45, to page 7, line 1 to 5 for the English.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you read French?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Okay.  Then you should address your mind to page 3, lines 6 to 17.  

Now, I'm going to read to you what Mr. Juvénal Kajelijeli had to say about the Interahamwe in Mukingo.  He was questioned thus.  Page 45 -- line 45, page 6 in English. 

Now, we are talking about MRND Interahamwe, which was the youth wing of the MRND.  Excuse me.  "Interahamwe, which was the youth wing of MRND, was launched in Kigali in 1991.  Isn't that correct?"  To which Mr. Kajelijeli responded:  "That is correct."  

Then he was asked:  "It now spread to the other parts of Rwanda, including Mukingo commune; isn't that correct?"  And then he answered:  "That is correct."  

Now, reflecting on the testimony of Juvénal Kajelijeli himself, would you reconsider your position that the Interahamwe never existed in Mukingo?  
A.	I believe I have nothing to change.  I know those people.  These were Interahamwe, they were truants.  I don't know what Kajelijeli bases himself to state that there were Interahamwe.  I shared everything with them, I would play football with them.  I know their behaviour, and I'm telling you, among those so-said Interahamwe, you had deserters from the board.  How can you refer to them as Interahamwe?  That is a problem.  
Q.	Well, you just agreed that Kajelijeli's better placed to comment on this issue; isn't that the case?  
A.	I understand.  But, let me tell you that Kajelijeli never met those young people when they were carrying out their activities of so-said Interahamwe.  So, while you claim that he knew that Interahamwes existed, it is likely that he was mistaken because these were truants who were calling themselves Interahamwe.  Maybe he was mistaken, probably because he just didn't know this.  
Q.	All right, we'll move on.  

Now, let's discuss uniforms.  To the best of my understanding, it is your testimony that these persons who described themselves as Interahamwe wore uniforms that they had bought from the market.  Is that correct?  
A.	Yes, most people bought them during rallies which were chaired by the president of the republic.  They bought that fabric.  
Q.	Could you describe this fabric to the Court, please?  
A.	You had two types of fabric.  You had headscarf -- head ties, and then you had shirts.  I never saw anybody in trousers made out of that fabric.  But I did see people who were wearing baseball hats.  
Q.	So this was a distinctive fabric that these people wore.  
A.	These were the MRND ibitenge, but not everybody could afford it, as I already stated.  
Q.	Thank you.  So the fabric was MRND ibitenge; is that how you describe it?  
A.	Yes, indeed, it was -- it was ibitenge bearing MRND colours.  
Q.	Now, you claimed that these were bought from the market, these MRND ibitenges.  Just to inform you, I want to refer you and the Court to an excerpt from Mr. Juvénal Kajelijeli's judgement, in his trial before this Tribunal.  
MR. SENDZE: 
And that is at page 42 to 45 of my bundle.  It is only in English because we do not have a French translation.  And the judgement is dated 1st of December 2003.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Witness, now I'm going to read from page 44 in the bundle.  It's in English, so I'm afraid you would not be able to follow in French.  But you would rely on your interpretation.  

Paragraph 402 of that judgement found that:  "The Interahamwe in Mukingo commune used distinctive uniforms" -- you and I have agreed on that -- "and that the Accused" -- Kajelijeli -- "participated in the distribution of these uniforms."  

Now, this is what they found, and I am putting to you -- putting it to you, just to inform you and give you an opportunity to review your testimony.  What do you have to say?  
A.	If such is their finding, I would still say I never saw anyone saying that they had received ibitenge from Kajelijeli.  Personally I never knew anything about ibitenge with respect to Kajelijeli.  I never heard anybody say that they had received ibitenge from Kajelijeli.  So this judgement is of no consequence to me, as far as I know.  
Q.	Okay.  So the fact that you did not hear implies that it never happened; is that what you are telling this Court?  
A.	I am relying on what I know to give my testimony.  Most people from my area bought ibitenge during the meetings that President Habyarimana presided over.  I never learnt that anyone received ibitenge or kitenge uniforms from Kajelijeli.  I am not aware of anything like that.  
Q.	Okay.  Now that we have established that the so-called Interahamwe wore MRND ibitenge uniforms, or -- yeah, MRND ibitenge, we are going to move on to another subject, which is military training and distribution of weapons to youths in Mukingo.  

Now, is it your testimony before this Court that no military training or distribution of weapons were ever carried out in Mukingo prior to the death of the president?  
A.	Regarding the distribution of weapons, I know that people were trained for self-defence purposes, that is responsable cellule and conseillers.  But to rely on that to say that firearms were distributed to Interahamwe, I would say that is not true.  I never saw weapons being distributed to the Interahamwe.  
Q.	You never saw weapons being distributed to the Interahamwe, or weapons were never distributed to the Interahamwe; which one is it?  
A.	There was no distribution of weapons.  
Q.	Now, you have talked about the civil defence programme.  Isn't it the case that, as part of the civil defence programme, youths of political parties were recruited and trained, including youths in Mukingo?  
A.	I know that at the Byangabo centre where I lived, no youth underwent military training.  I have told you that youths probably participated in the recruitment tests that were conducted by the army, and that this might have been confused with military drills.  I have also told you that amongst those youths of Byangabo, there were also deserters, including my elder brother and Musafiri.  Probably people relied on the presence of these deserters to talk about the existence of military training.  I do not know whether the persons who provided that information did not consider the recruitment test conducted by the army to say that there was military training, whereas actually it had to do only with recruitment tests.  
Q.	So your brother was -- your brother went through this recruitment test as well as others, and they were subsequently given weapons; isn't that the case?  
A.	My elder brother was a soldier.  He had a rank of soldier.  You therefore understand that he underwent military training before going to the war front.  And, when he was a soldier, he had a firearm.  But when he returned home, he had to leave the firearm in the camp.  He was then considered as a civilian, and therefore could not continue to carry his arm.  
Q.	Isn't he one of those people who were running around Mukingo and Ruhengeri killing the Tutsis?  Referring to your brother.  
A.	He was a member of that group, but this does not necessarily imply that he had a firearm. 
Q.	What did he use to kill the Tutsis in Mukingo?  
A.	I could not go close to him.  I was still very young, and I didn't want to be beaten up.  I therefore am in no position to describe the kind of weapons that they were using to kill the Tutsi.  
Q.	So if he killed them with a gun, you would not know.  
A.	There were many people, and it was very difficult to be able to notice the weapon that was used by this one or that.  There were people who were using knives, others were using sticks, while yet others were using arms.  But I was not in a position to be able to identify the various weapons used by specific individuals.  
Q.	Okay.  
MR. SENDZE: 
I would like to refer the Court to -- 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	First of all, Mr. Witness, do you know Dr. Charles Nzabagerageza? 
A.	I have already told you that he was the director of the Busogo institute.  But, please, wait a minute, Nzabagerageza, Charles, was rather the préfet of Ruhengeri préfecture.  
Q.	I agree with you.  He was the préfet of Ruhengeri in 1992.  
MR. SENDZE: 
On that note I would refer the Court to my bundle on page -- at pages 28 to 33 in English, and page 34 to 40 in French.  For the record, this is a letter from Dr. Charles Nzabagerageza, préfet of Ruhengeri in 1992, to the minister of interior and development.  And it is dated the 23rd of May 1992.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Now, Witness, in this letter the préfet is transmitting a report of a meeting held on the 15th of May 1992.  And in it he discusses the civil defence programme.  And I would read from page 31 of the bundle in the English, which can be followed up on page 38 of the bundle in French.  The first paragraph on that page, around about the middle.  

Concerning the civil defence, he says:  "However, it is necessary to order more weapons for the ongoing of the training of members of the population.  Once the firearms were available, the training would continue in the Kigombe and Cyeru commune" -- that is spelled C-Y-E-R-U -- "after the Mukingo and Nkuli communes.  Furthermore, members of the préfecture security committee would participate in that training."  

Now, this is the préfet of Ruhengeri calling for the supply of more arms to be distributed to the population, who would be trained as part of the civil defence programme which was operating in Rwanda at the time.  In light of this information, do you still insist that members of the population were not trained as part of the civil defence programme, and given arms?  
A.	All I have said is that amongst the people who called themselves Interahamwe, no one received a firearm.  But as for the Amahindure, they received training to be able to defend the population.  So I would say that the distribution of weapons to the Amahindure should not be confused with the distribution to the supposedly -- or, to the so-called Interahamwe. 
Q.	Now, you testified that Musafiri carried a grenade and firearms with him when he ran around Mukingo and Ruhengeri committing atrocities against the Tutsi.  Where do you think he obtained these weapons from?  
A.	When they were arrested by members of the police force -- or, when he was arrested by members of the police force, he usually came back with more grenades.  But, regarding fire -- a -- the firearm, I heard it said that he obtained the firearm from ************************ called **********************. 
Q.	And who was ***************************? 
A.	He was the ********************************. 
Q.	And an official of the MRND, wasn't he?  
A.	That I did not know.  I am unable to say which was his political party.  
Q.	Thank you.  Let's move on.  Now, you also testified about the attacks on the court of appeal in Ruhengeri, and you confirmed that you participated in that attack; is that correct?  
A.	I followed the assailants that went there.  
Q.	And the assailants you followed, these were the persons who slaughtered the Tutsis who were taking shelter at the court of appeal; is that not the case?  
A.	I think that it's indeed those assailants who killed refugees at the Ruhengeri court of appeal.  But I should also tell you that there were many other persons, including displaced persons who had come from Byumba and from other corners of Ruhengeri.  You therefore cannot contend that it was the members of the groups that had followed who were the only ones who perpetrated the killings there.  
Q.	So when they were joining the others to kill the Tutsis at the court of appeal, where were you?  
A.	While the killings were going on, I have explained to you that some other persons and myself continued on our way towards the Ruhengeri centre, and that we were intercepted by a Ruhengeri patrol that seized weapons from my companions.  And it is after that incident that we were held in detention.  You therefore understand that the attack took place at a time when my other companions and myself were in detention.  
Q.	But you knew what was happening at the court of appeal, didn't you?  You know why your friends, the assailants, had gone to the court of appeal.  
A.	Yes, I knew the reason wherefore they had gone to the premises of the Ruhengeri court of appeal. 
Q.	After you realised -- or, you confirmed what they had done, slaughtered innocent Tutsi refugees at the court of appeal, you continued to associate yourself with them very closely, didn't you?  
A.	Yes, I continued to go around with them.  
Q.	Did you report this horrible incident to anybody? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, you should understand that I was still young, and I liked to look on violent scenes.  It wasn't anything special to me.  It was rather more like a game, as far as I was concerned.  Today I cannot commend the people who perpetrated the killings but, at the time, as I was still very young, I was curious and I would look on at the scenes without any further thought.  
Q.	At 11 years old, the mind of an 11-year-old child, the slaughter of your brothers and sisters, you considered a game, leisure; is that what you are saying to this Court?  
A.	I did not have any power to be able to stop what was happening.  I could not forbid those assailants that were perpetrating the killings from doing what they were doing.  I therefore could only look on -- or, witness what was happening without being in a position to do anything about it.  I was powerless.  
Q.	Now, the gendarmes that you say you -- you and your friends met at the court of appeal, were they not armed?  
A.	Amongst the assailants there were some who had firearms, like Musafiri.  There were also other assailants who had come from Byumba and from other corners of Ruhengeri.  But I do not know whether those other assailants also had firearms.  
(Pages 17 to 25 by Kirstin McLean)





























1150H 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Witness, I am talking about the gendarmes.  Did they have firearms? 
A.	I have already told you that the -- that there were gendarmes who were armed, but that -- that they were outnumbered because they were -- there were six in number, so they could not face up to a wave of assailants that had come in several vehicles.  They tried to frighten the assailants by shooting in the air, but they, subsequently, had to give up and retreat. 
Q.	But the only assailant you recall having a weapon is Musafiri.  So amongst the assailants who came to the court of appeal, Musafiri carried a weapon, and you encountered gendarmes who were all armed.  Are you trying to tell this Court that Musafiri, with his single gun and probably a grenade, was able to scare away the gendarmes stationed at the court of appeal? 
A.	I have told you that there were other assailants who had firearms, but that I didn't know all of them because some of them had come from Mukingo, but that others had come from other parts of Ruhengeri.  I am, therefore, confirming that apart from Musafiri, who had received a weapon from the ************************, there were other assailants who also had firearms.  And I would like to remind you that Ruhengeri was a war zone -- it was a combat zone, and so it was very easy to avail oneself of a firearm there.  
Q.	Witness, two things.  First of all, you agree that in Ruhengeri -- Ruhengeri was the station for a gendarmerie school.  Do you agree with me? 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	And you say -- 
A.	I agree with you.  
Q.	And you say Ruhengeri was a war zone, implying that the number of troops, soldiers, gendarmes who would have been present in Ruhengeri would have been, to say the least, overwhelming, since it was a war zone.  And you want the Court to believe that these gendarmes were scared of a couple of assailants who had come from outside Ruhengeri?  I put it to you that these attacks took place with the knowledge of the authorities, and that is why, in spite of the presence of any gendarmes within the premises of the court of appeal, the innocent Tutsis who came to seek refuge at the court of appeal were, nevertheless, killed.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I don't want to stop the witness from answering the Prosecutor's question, but the phrasing of the Prosecutor's question is not based on a fact, but on some form of reasoning -- on speculation. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is cross-examination, Mr. Nimy.  We think the question is proper.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, may the Prosecutor rephrase his question relying on facts -- basing himself on facts, so that the witness, who is testifying on facts, should give his testimony on the basis of facts and not on the basis of some kind of reasoning or analysis.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I've already ruled on that matter, Mr. Nimy.  
MR. NIMY:
Oh, I did not understand your decision.  I had thought that you had asked me to explain my objections or my observation.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	So, Witness, could the Court hear your response, please.  
A.	You say that Ruhengeri was a combat zone, and I do agree with you, but most of the soldiers were at the war front in the Kinigi region.  But regarding the number of soldiers that were in Ruhengeri town, only a military commander could give you reliable information on the matter.  I am not a 
	military commander.  
Q.	Just again -- to give you some information -- I want to refer you and the Court to -- 
MR. SENDZE:
Actually, I think this is not -- this is not in my bundle, but I'll make reference to it anyway just to put the information to the witness and he will comment.  
BY MR SENDZE:
Q.	I want you to know that Juvénal Kajelijeli has been convicted by this Tribunal, a conviction that was affirmed on appeal for his role in authorising the attack on the innocent Tutsis at the Ruhengeri court of appeal.  And for the record, I'm referring to the section XVI -- that is, page 60 to 63 of the Appeals Chamber judgement in Kajelijeli.  
A.	You keep talking about Kajelijeli in respect to those incidents.  I'd like to tell you that, personally, I did not see Kajelijeli during those incidents.  And I'd like to say, by the way, that Kajelijeli had been protecting Tutsis since 1990 and up to 1993, and I do recall that when the RPF members attacked Ruhengeri in 1993, Tutsis sought refuge in the premises of the Busogo -- a higher institute.  And when the assailants sought to attack them, Kajelijeli intervened in order to stop the attacks that were being launched against the Tutsis.  

This had already taken place in 1992, and the assailants usually took it out on Kajelijeli and even condemned his stance.  So when you're talking about the alleged role played by Kajelijeli in the premises of the court of appeal, I would tell you that Kajelijeli had nothing to do with that attack because I did not see him. 
Q.	Now, you also claim that when you were arrested -- when you were arrested, your release was prompted by a bunch of assailants who had threatened to demolish the prison cell or the police station holding.  Is that what you testified to? 
A.	Yes, indeed, that is what happened.  
Q.	And who told you about this? 
A.	I could hear the assailants shouting and throwing stones on the roof of the brigade area from my cell.  
Q.	So you're telling the Court that the assailants were going to use stones to demolish the prison cell and that somehow scared the gendarmes who had you in custody? 
A.	Firstly, you had a number of assailants, and then among those assailants you had people who had grenades and firearms, and that is what led the gendarmes to believe that the assailants could, indeed, demolish the house where the brigade was found, and so they chose to release us.  
Q.	Okay.  Did you discuss this incident at the court of appeal with your uncle, Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	My uncle provided us some form of assistance, but that did not mean that I discussed everything with him.  As a matter of fact, I -- let me tell you that I didn't meet him -- I didn't see him during that time, and, indeed, had I seen him, I wouldn't have discussed it with him.  I was too young to discuss such a subject with him.  
Q.	Was the incident widely discussed in Ruhengeri and in Mukingo?  Was it discussed amongst the assailants and amongst the people of the region? 
A.	I didn't pay attention to that.  I didn't seek to see if members of the population -- or, if the assailants discussed it among themselves subsequently.  I -- indeed, I told you that I immediately returned home. 
Q.	So you're saying these friends of yours, with whom you descended on the court of appeal and returned to Mukingo later on, forgot about the incident completely and never talked to you -- or, talked to 
each other about it; is that what you're saying? 
A.	I told you that after that incident I returned home, so I didn't stay with the members of that group to know what they discussed.  
Q.	So you never left your home again, ever, after that, to go to the Byangabo centre or move around Mukingo? 
A.	It was already night-time, I could no longer go out to Byangabo, and I had to return home early.  
Q.	I'm not talking about on the same day of the attack.  After that day, are you saying you never left your home? 
A.	The following day I told you that I left home to accompany them when they were going to Nyakinama.  
Q.	Okay.  I put it to you that it was widely known in Ruhengeri and in Mukingo that the Tutsis sheltered at the court of appeal had been killed.  And it was also widely known that Tutsis were being killed all around Mukingo, at the Busogo parish, at the Byangabo centre, and you have also testified to the 
death -- or, the killing of Rukara.  Do you agree with me that all these incidents were widely known within the Mukingo area? 
A.	No, I do not agree with you.  You're saying everyone was aware of this, while this was a group of bandits that had perpetrated these atrocities?  No, it was not the entire population of Mukingo that knew about it.  
Q.	So Tutsis were being killed in public.  The number of Tutsis who died in Busogo parish was only known to the assailants who went there and killed these people.  Is that -- I want to understand you very well before I move on.  
A.	Yes.  I understand that part of the population was informed, but, you know, everyone was informed that Tutsi had -- Tutsis had been killed.  But when you talk to -- refer to the fact that the entire population of Mukingo -- all the pub -- figures of authorities were informed, I disagree with you.  
Q.	Anyway, that is not what I said, but we'll move on.  How many times did you see your uncle, Mr. Nzirorera, in Mukingo or in Ruhengeri as a whole between 1990 and 1994?  To the best of your knowledge, could you tell the Court? 
A.	I saw him the first time when he came to the burial of his brother, Ntamakemwa, Silas; the second time was during the wedding of his brother, Bonaventure; and the third time was in 1994, during the swearing into office of Kajelijeli.  On another occasion, I heard my grandmother talking about it.  That must have been two or three weeks after when my mother told -- said that Nzirorera had come to the house, but that is only reported speech -- that was only something that was told me by my grandmother.  
Q.	So you're agreeing that Mr. Nzirorera visited Mukingo in 1994, including April 1994, when all these killings of innocent Tutsis had happened within the commune and within the préfecture of Ruhengeri?  
A.	According to information that I got from my grandmother, he arrived there two weeks afterwards, but after all those events.  He only came back during Juvénal Kajelijeli's oath -- swearing into office.  
Q.	And you agree that your uncle, Mr. Nzirorera, was a very influential figure -- a popular figure in Mukingo; don't you agree? 
A.	Yes.  He was, indeed, a respectable man, yes.  
Q.	And I put it to you that visiting the area two weeks or so, like you say, after hundreds of Tutsis in his local community had been massacred -- innocent Tutsis had been massacred, he was in the position to know or be aware of these events; don't you think so? 
A.	He wouldn't have often such information from me.  I don't know the people that he got to meet, but you could ask him that question, and then he'll tell you circumstances -- the circumstances under which he learnt about those events.  
Q.	Yeah.  I was not suggesting that you told him.  I'm suggesting to you that, given the circumstances and the facts, he would have known that all these hundreds of Tutsis had been killed within his local commune.  At least do you agree with me on that? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I believe that that question should be put to the person concerned, not me.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Mr. President, Your Honours, the cross-examination has so far lasted 1 hour, 10 minutes.  And going by the standards, he has about 15 more minutes to complete.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.
MR. SENDZE:
Thank you, Mr. Constant.  I'll be done before the 15 minutes.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Now, Witness, you testified that you were present during the swearing-in of Juvénal Kajelijeli as bourgmestre of Mukingo in June 1994; is that correct? 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	And your uncle --
A.	That's correct.
Q.	Sorry.  And your Uncle Nzirorera was present at this swearing-in ceremony? 
A.	Yes, he was.  
Q.	Why did the Amahindure have to march during this ceremony? 
A.	I don't know why they did.  I was not an authority, and I don't know why those people marched. 
Q.	So why do you think your uncle attended this swearing-in ceremony?  In what capacity do you think he was present at this occasion? 
A.	He was there as a member of the population of Mukingo, and he had come to also support the bourgmestre who, during his swearing into office -- during his swearing of office.  That's it.  
Q.	And he had come all the way from Kigali; correct? 
A.	I don't know if he had come from Kigali because I am well aware that Kigali had already fallen to the RPF.  So I don't believe that he had come from Kigali.  
Q.	Okay.  Now, your uncle was secretary general of the MRND party, and he was a parliamentarian from the Mukingo area, and you're saying he would attend a swearing-in ceremony of the bourgmestre and would not address the crowd? 
A.	He did not take the floor during that ceremony.  
Q.	Now, referring to the Amahindure, whom you claim marched on that day, did you happen to see ********************* amongst these Amahindure? 
A.	I don't know if he was a member of the Amahindure.  I was there far behind, and I couldn't see all the members of the army -- Amahindure organisation, and I was unable to know all the members of the Amahindure organisation.  
Q.	Now, Witness, before we conclude, I just want to put this to you:  One of those you name as being part of this group that you normally run around with has identified you as one of those who were involved in the attacks and in the killings of Tutsis in Mukingo.  And he has identified you as one of those who are in hiding, in other words, a fugitive.  And the person I am referring to -- 
MR. SENDZE:
Give me a minute, Your Honours, I don't want to compromise any --
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	That person is commonly known as BTH.  Do you have any comments? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, you say I am in hiding and that I'm avoiding the law.  If such was the case, I wouldn't have appeared before this Chamber.  Further, it's true that I was with those people; I was moving about with them, but it was out of curiosity to see what was happening.  Anybody who saw me could have thought that I had participated in the attacks.  I do not deny the fact that I was present, but I did not participate in the killings.  I would not like my older brother -- I wouldn't -- I did not want my older brother to see me there because I was scared he'd beat me.  But I would like to add that I am not on the run.  That's not the case.  I'm not at -- 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  To conclude with you, I want to tell you -- I want to put it to you that given your very close association with Mr. Nzirorera, being his nephew, and him being responsible somewhat for who you are today and your involvement in the attacks of innocent Tutsis in Mukingo and in Ruhengeri, I suggest to you that your evidence before this Court is tainted and should not be believed.  
A.	You're saying that because Nzirorera is my uncle -- the fact that I'm Nzirorera's -- I am Nzirorera's nephew has nothing to do with what I did.  I said that I was moving about because I was curious.  

Mr. Prosecutor, when you were young I'm -- you're -- I'm sure this also happened to you.  You would follow people out of curiosity -- groups of people, not necessarily participating in their active -- taking part in their activities.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. SENDZE:
Mr. President, that brings me to the close of my cross-examination.  And I thank the witness for his cooperation.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  Do you wish to tender documents? 
MR. SENDZE:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How many? 
MR. SENDZE:
Two documents.  The first document would be the 17th of April 2003, the testimony of Juvénal Kajelijeli in his own trial.  Page 1 to 3 of my bundle represents the French excerpts.  Pages 4 to 7 represent the English excerpts.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar? 
MR. MJUI:
The document will be P. 374. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. P. 374 admitted)

MR. SENDZE: 
And then, finally, the 23rd of May 1992 letter from Dr. Charles Nzabagerageza.  It's page -- 
pages 28 to 32 of my bundle in English, page 34 to page 40 for French.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Doesn't the English extend to page 33? 
MR. SENDZE:
Yes, it does, page 33.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
MR. MJUI:
The document will be P. 375:  A for French, B for English.  Thank you.  
(Exhibit No. P. 375A and P. 375B admitted)
MR. SENDZE:
Most obliged, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Nimy, do you wish to have any redirect? 
MR. NIMY:
Yes, very brief, Mr. President -- just one question, indeed.

Can I proceed, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)...so.  
RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Tell me, Witness -- I have one question for you.  It's a follow-up to one of -- in redirect -- one of the 
last questions that was put to you by the Prosecutor with regard to Nzirorera.  In relation to all these 
killings -- this incident -- all these -- all that these Tutsis had to endure, I would like to you ask you the following questions, Mr. Witness.  With respect to the Prosecution question whether Nzirorera was an influential and popular man, your answer was he was respected.  My question -- or, my questions are as follows:  What could Nzirorera have done against the assailants? 
A.	I believe that, at the time of the events, Nzirorera had no authority over those assailants.  Unless he had been a commander in the army, I can't see what sort of power he had.  Even soldiers could not confront those assailants, even less so Nzirorera.  
Q.	Which assailants whose life -- I mean, survival depended on Nzirorera? 
A.	None.  I don't know anyone.  
Q.	Which assailants could he have been afraid of -- which assailants could have been afraid of losing anything whatsoever by the hand of Nzirorera? 
A.	As I already said, I know that during those events Nzirorera was not on the grounds.  We tried to find out about him, but we were unable to do so.  Even family members did not know where he was.  
To answer your question, I can't see whoever it was that could have been afraid of any form of reprisals from Nzirorera.  I can't say who that is.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And the witness adds --
THE WITNESS:
And, indeed, Nzirorera was not there.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	That said, thank you, Mr. Witness.  I believe the Chamber understands that Nzirorera could do nothing against those assailants, as he had nothing to do with them.  Is that what you mean? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, that's not a question.  That's a sort of submission you make during your closing arguments.  
MR. NIMY:
Withdrawn, Mr. President, and I'll -- I have -- and I have concluded my redirect with the witness.  

Mr. President, however -- however, I'd like to apply for you to permit the witness, who was 
Nzirorera's nephew, to visit him in UNDF before leaving Arusha, and if you -- if it pleases the Court, 
this should be organised by the requisite services.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, I can assure you that even though we still have a few minutes left, we will take the adjournment immediately.  

Mr. Witness, this concludes your testimony.  We thank you, as we do all witnesses, for assisting the Court in its work, but now you're excused and you're free to go.  The registry will arrange for you to see Mr. Nzirorera.  
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take our adjournment until tomorrow morning.  Thank you.
(Court adjourned at 1226H)
