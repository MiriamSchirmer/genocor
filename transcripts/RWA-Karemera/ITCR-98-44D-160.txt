P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Madam Registrar, can you open the proceedings?  
MS. KOUO:
Yes.  Thank you, Mr. President. 

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short, and Judge Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Thursday, the 30th of November 2006, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the               Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case Number ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Registrar. 

Ms. Hounkpatin, I notice that your bench is not complete.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Yes.  Good morning, Mr. President; good morning, Your Honours; and good morning, everybody.  As you have just said, the key figure of my team is lacking this morning that is Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse who is sick.  And he cannot come to the hearing this morning.  And I would request that the 
Trial Chamber suspend proceedings in order to enable him to be present in conformity with Rule 20 -- or, in fact Article 20 of the statute.  

Now, Mr. Ngirumpatse has always been present during proceedings.  And I would like for this to continue, i.e., for him to be present during all proceedings.  So that is my request, and in answer to your comment, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Apart from that, the appearances are the same, right?  Yes.  

Prosecutor, do you have anything?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
No, Your Honour.  I will leave the matter in the Court's discretion. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

What we think should happen is this, we have an oral ruling to deliver on the issue connected with the adjudicated facts.  Because of the nature of the ruling, we think it would be necessary to have, at least, a short break for its implications to be considered.  And we would invite the registrar to make enquiries concerning Mr. Ngirumpatse's health conditions.  And when we get a response from that, we will make a decision on the issue as to whether we will suspend the proceedings or not.  

I think what I would like to do, first of all, is deliver the oral ruling that we have.  

On 16th of June 2006, the Appeals Chamber upheld, in part, the Prosecution's interlocutory appeal of the Trial Chamber's decision on Judicial Notice; and, among other things, remanded the matter for further consideration of adjudicated facts.  

The Chamber has completed its deliberations pertaining to the Appeals Chamber's remand, and the decision will be available in the next few days.

However, since facts 16 to 24 and 31 to 64 of the Prosecution's motion seeking judicial notice are closely related to the anticipated testimony of the next witness to be called, the Chamber will now deliver its findings concerning them only.  It must be noted that the full text of the decision is the authoritative statement of the Chamber's findings and reasoning in that respect.

It is also important to mention at this stage that the Chamber has reviewed the adjudicated facts sought for judicial notice according to the Appeals Chamber's directions, and, particularly, taking into account whether the facts were related to the acts, conduct, or mental state of the Accused; and if not, whether under the circumstances of the case admitting them will advance the objective of expediency of the proceedings without compromising the rights of the Accused.

For reasons detailed in its written decision, the Chamber takes judicial notice of the following facts extracted from the Kajelijeli Judgement as follows: 

Facts 16, 17, and 20 to 24.  

Fact 33, but modified so as to include a specific reference to the location of the attack as it stands in the corresponding paragraph 597 of the Kajelijeli Judgement.  

Facts 41 to 46. 

Facts 49, 54, 57, 58, 59 and 61.  
For reasons detailed in its written decision, the Chamber declines to take judicial notice of the following facts: 

Facts 18 and 19. 

Facts 34 to 39. 

Fact 40. 

Facts 47 to 48.  

Facts 50, 51, 52, 53, 55, 56, 60, 62, 63 and 64.

Finally, it must be noted that facts 31 and 32 have not been appealed, and, therefore, were not remanded to the Chamber for further consideration.  The findings of the Chamber on those facts in the decision of 9 November 2005 still stand.  

This is our oral ruling.  

Now, we've considered that we should allow about one hour for consideration of the implication of this rule -- ruling.  And we are thinking that we should take a recess until 11 o'clock for that purpose.  In the meantime, we would invite the registrar to make enquiries concerning the health and condition of Mr. Ngirumpatse.

We will rise now.

(Court resumed at 1418H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.  The registrar -- we did get a report concerning Mr. Ngirumpatse's condition, and I'll just ask the registrar to read it.  It's a very brief report, and it will probably be distributed during the course of the afternoon through CMS. 
MS. KOUO:
Thank you, Mr. President.  The certificate of good heath received from UN clinic reads as follows:  "This is to certify that Mr. Ngirumpatse was examined at UNICTR clinic, and he's unfit to testify in the court from the 30th of November 2006 to the 30th of November 2006."  

Thank you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Forgive me, Mr. President.  I did not understand from what date to which date -- from which date to what date -- from which date to which date he is not available to testify.  
JUDGE KAM:
Only for today, Counsel.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  In the circumstances we thought that we could continue this afternoon.  It's -- it's -- it's just this afternoon.  We'll make arrangements for him to get access to the day's proceedings, as we have done on other occasions.  Both yourself and Mr. Weyl are here, and it's the examination-in-chief -- the commencement of the examination-in-chief, and so we anticipate that this would not have an impact on the fairness of the trial against him.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I'm sorry to contradict you.  I think that, precisely because it is a new witness who is to begin testifying, the presence of the Accused is absolutely necessary.  The certificate just read out indicates that it is only for the day of today.  I think that the request I made this morning for the hearing to be suspended should be taken into account.  And we don't want a forced-march justice in the absence of accused who are particularly interested in their case.  I think that judicial wisdom would indicate that we suspend this afternoon's hearing, and then if his health allows, he will be present tomorrow.  

And I should like to insist on the fact that, since the beginning of these proceedings, over these hundred or so days of hearings that we have under our belt -- or, we have behind us -- the Trial Chamber has behind it, Mr. Ngirumpatse has not been absent.  And it would be prejudicial to him to consider it's true.  We are his lawyers, but his presence is absolutely necessary.  

And that is the comment I wish to make, Mr. President, at this stage. 
JUDGE SHORT:
It's okay.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, is it necessary for me to be heard or not?  I'd like to be heard if you're going to stick with your decision.  But maybe in light of what Ms. Hounkpatin said, you might reconsider your decision.  But if you haven't, I would like to be heard.  I feel very strongly that you cannot try someone in absentia.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We have decided to sit -- not to sit this afternoon, and we'll take the adjournment now until tomorrow morning.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We -- we take the recess now and resume tomorrow morning.
