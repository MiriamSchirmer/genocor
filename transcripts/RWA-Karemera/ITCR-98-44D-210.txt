P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Hometowu, could you open the proceedings please. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

The Trial Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of 
Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Jøensen, is now sitting in open session, today, Monday, the 26th of October 2009 for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, case No. ICTR-98-44-T.

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.

The appearances are the same. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President.  Mr. Nimy will be arriving a little bit late, otherwise the appearances are the same.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, reading the press I have to enquire whether this is your (inaudible) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, I have a client here who wants to have his trial and one in the Hague who doesn't, so I'm with the one that wants to have his trial. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Inaudible)

Mr. Sow, welcome. 
MR. SOW: 
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Good morning, everyone.  It is with lots of pleasure that I'm back in this courtroom this morning.  And you realise that Ms.  Diagne is not present this morning, but she'll be joining us in a short while.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Welcome back to proceedings.

Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honour, I'm sorry to bother you with this. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, Mr. N'Dow, it's my fault.  I should've noticed earlier or remembered. 
MR. N'DOW:
Before Mr. Webster continues with his interesting cross-examination, I have this document to tender.  And we've already agreed, Your Honour, with Mr. Robinson that the excerpts, which is a page -- a 10-page document, actually should go into evidence.  They are excerpts of transcripts of Witness MCR in the Setako case.  I have the 10-page -- in English and French.  

Mr. Issa can --  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Mr. Issa, could you issue exhibit numbers.  
MR. N'DOW:
This should be Exhibit P. 351, I suppose. 
MR. MJUI:
I confirm, Your Honour.  Thank you. 
MR. N'DOW:
And, Your Honour, also we have a statement. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And this is openly admitted.  Right?  
MR. N'DOW:
It is openly admitted.  I'm sorry, Your Honour.  The witness has testified in closed session so it should be under seal. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted under seal. 
     (Exhibit No. P. 351A and P. 351B admitted, under seal) 
MR. N'DOW:
We have a statement made by the witness before the Rwanda prosecutor, which is dated the 
10th of November 2006.  That also was used in cross-examination.  It's K number 0459286-88.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa.  
MR. MJUI:
The document will be P. 352.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. P. 352A and P. 352B admitted, under seal) 
MR.N'DOW: 
We have attached to it a rough courtesy translation.

And, Your Honour, the third one is the judgement dated the 16th of July 2009.  This was the judgement aspect of the destruction of property for which the witness was convicted and sentenced.  That also needs to be admitted.  That gives us P. 353.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted. 
MR. N'DOW:
Also a courtesy translation is attached to it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then there was a separate letter.  
MR. WALLACE: 
I'm sorry, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Would it have a separate letter?  
MR. N'DOW:
That should have a separate letter, yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Inaudible)
MR. N'DOW:
Yes, if we could have the Kinyarwanda text at A and the rough translation at B. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And this is under seal. 
MR. N'DOW:
Yes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted under seal.
(Exhibit No. P. 353A and P. 353B admitted, under seal)
MR. N'DOW:
And the interview -- the record of the interview that we had with Clara Nyirabutsitsi in Nairobi on the 4th of April 1994.  If that could be admitted for identification purposes, Your Honour.  It's only in English. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Marked for identification. 
MR. N'DOW:
And, Your Honour, just for housekeeping purposes, we have a better copy of the Gacaca -- of the report presented by the witness.  We promised to bring a better copy and the one we have, I think, 
Your Honour, is more legible.  

So we want to replace the one that had been admitted to the one that we have which is more legible, Your Honour.  I have it here.  I give it to Issa.  

We also have the Rwandan judgement of the rape acquittal against the witness which was tendered by the Defence.  It is in Kinyarwanda.  Again, Your Honour, we have a courtesy translation of the whole document in English, which we have here as well.  I'll give that to Issa.  That's a different exhibit. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Issa. 
MR. MJUI:
(Microphone not activated) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Mr. Issa. 
MR. MJUI:
I'm sorry, Your Honour.

The document marked for identification would be P. ID40.
(Exhibit No. IP. 40 marked for identification)
MR. N'DOW:
Yeah.  And I also have the French -- the judgement of acquittal of the rape charge, I have a translation.  It's in Kinyarwanda.  That was admitted as a different exhibit.  But we have a courtesy translation of the whole document, and I have it here with me.  I'll give it to you.  

Peter, you're with me, I guess.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  

Mr. President, that document, the acquittal, has not yet been formally given an exhibit number.  So I'd ask that that document be given the number D. NZ656, which I think is our next in order. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Issa.  
MR. MJUI:
Yes, Your Honour.  I confirm the document would be D. NZ656.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.  And this also is under seal, is it?  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ656 admitted, under seal)
MR. N'DOW:
Issa, what's the exhibit number for the report by Witness 2 -- number 2?  What's the exhibit number?  It had already been admitted and given an exhibit number, but I just wanted confirmation. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
It's D. NZ652.  
MR. N'DOW:
Right.  

Your Honour, just for housekeeping purposes as well, the Prosecution Exhibit P. 350, it was admitted under seal.  We ask that that be unsealed in view of the fact that it will be of frequent use in the cross-examination of Defence witnesses.  I don't think there is anything else of confidentiality in the document.  We ask that it be unsealed.  If it's -- it's the list prepared by the witness and it will be of frequent use. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
There's no objection, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We reconsider the order and the matters are admitted in open session. 
MR. N'DOW:
Thank you, Your Honours, for the time, and my learned friend, Mr. Webster, can continue with his cross-examination.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, your evidence will continue -- continue now.  I remind you that you remain under the same oath that you took when you began your testimony.  

Mr. Webster, you can continue with your examination. 
THE WITNESS:
That's okay, Mr. President.  I will comply with your directions.
WITNESS 6,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Good morning to you, Mr. Witness.  Good morning to the Court, the Defence, the Registry, everyone, but especially to you, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	We left off on Thursday discussing a rally, the MRND rally of the 15th of November 1992; do you remember that? 
A.	Yes, I remember. 
Q.	And on Thursday I had read to you an excerpt of the speech given by Dr. Casimir Bizimungu.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, the excerpt that I read, which is from a transcription, has not been formally admitted into evidence yet and I'd like to do that now.

It's from the video tape, which is admitted as P. 11.  And this is just a two-page excerpt which I'd like to be reflected in the record.  

I believe the registry already has a copy and it's in all three languages. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, when something is already in evidence and we're basically making a copy of a portion of it, I -- I think, if you're going to be consistent, and avoiding duplication, this might be one area where we would simply be better off having the original document referred to, as opposed to making a copy of a portion of it.  But it's up to you.
MR. WEBSTER:
The original document was never in evidence.  We had the speech by Ngirumpatse and the speech by Karemera admitted, but the entire transcript was not admitted -- had not been prepared when we used it initially.  

So what is in evidence is the videotape itself, which is at least three or four hours, and two excerpts that had been transcribed back in 2006.  What I have here is a two-page excerpt from 
Bizimungu's speech which would facilitate matters for the Chamber if it was in evidence -- since it's in writing we wouldn't have to refer to the videotape itself.  We can put either -- we can put in the entire transcription which now has been accomplished, or we can put in this two-page excerpt, which is really all that interests me at this point. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will admit it.  Exhibit number, please.  It is in open or is under seal?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, it's in open.  The next Prosecution number?  
MR. MJUI:
(Microphone not activated)...sorry, the next exhibit will be P. 355 (sic).  Thank you.
(Exhibit No. P. 354 admitted) 

BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, last Thursday you told us that anyone could buy kitenge fabric in the marketplace.  And my question to you is:  Did you or any of your ********** members buy and wear such fabric prior to the 15th of November 1992? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  The Prosecutor is asking me whether a member of the ************** association might have bought a kitenge fabric before the 15th November 1992.  What I'd say, rather, is prior to 1994 I never noticed any member of the ************* association that might have bought that fabric, but this doesn't mean that nobody bought it.  It is possible that some member of the association might have bought the fabric without my knowledge, or might even have worn a dress made from it without my realising this. 
Q.	But no one from your group was wearing that fabric on 15th November 1992, is that your evidence? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  As I have already explained, I did not monitor the members of my association to be in a position to confirm whether they wore this attire or some other attire.  The Ruhengeri rally had already been announced and certain persons, seeking to show the public they were members of the MRND party, could wear an attire that is tailored from the kitenge fabric on that occasion. 
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, you would agree that this kitenge is associated with the MRND party and associated exclusively with the MRND party? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  That fabric was associated with the MRND party, because that party had an emblem like any other political party and each party also had a specific uniform that distinguished it from other political parties. 
Q.	Thank you.  And you remember that last Thursday you also told us that the MRND president in Ruhengeri préfecture would be in a position to know if there were Interahamwes or MRND in Ruhengeri, right? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I've said if Interahamwe existed in Ruhengeri préfecture, the president of the MRND in that Ruhengeri préfecture should have been informed about it. 
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, I'd like us to look at another document from our bundle.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And if Mr. Issa could give the witness the next document.  It's in Kinyarwanda.  I'll read its K number so Mr. Issa can recognise it.  It's K05 -- excuse me.  K458875.  We have the English and the French as well.  

If Mr. Issa could give the Kinyarwanda text to the witness.  It is tab A, should be the third document in.  At the top it says:  (Kinyarwanda spoken) 1992.  
MR. MJUI:
Yes. 

BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you look at the bottom of that page and you see a stamp, MRND, and there's a little symbol and it says "Ruhengeri préfecture".  Would you agree with me that's the seal of the MRND party for Ruhengeri?  You see where I'm talking about, Mr. Witness?  Mr. Witness?  We're going to read the document together.  Just listen to the question and answer the question, right?  Do you see the seal at the bottom of that page? 
A.	Yes, I can see the stamp.  I've seen it. 
Q.	Do you agree that's the MRND seal for the Ruhengeri préfecture? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I do not agree with the Prosecutor.  For the reason that from 1984 when I went to school I was not interested in the history of the MRND to be in a position to confirm that the seal that I am seeing on this document is, indeed, the seal of that party.  I did not carry out any research of the party and nor am I a politician.  I'm, therefore, in no position to confirm that this is the seal of that party, as the Prosecutor is claiming. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, if you look at the top left-hand corner of the document you see it says:  "MRND Ruhengeri.  BP 201", which is (French spoken) 201, and there's a telephone number.  Isn't that the address of the MRND party in Ruhengeri? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  That is what I was trying to explain a short while ago.  The Prosecutor is putting questions to me in respect of the party at the préfecture level.  And I have told him that I am not in a position to confirm what he is putting to me as a suggestion.  My status didn't make it possible for me to be informed about that topic. 
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.  Well, for the record, Your Honours, let me state to the Chamber that this is a document that was recovered by investigators of the ICTR, the Office of the Prosecutor, who went to Ruhengeri sometime last year and recovered a number of documents from the préfectoral office and from the 
	commune office of Nyakinama.  And we can provide the documentation from our evidence unit to clarify that.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, this document is dated the 28th of October 1992.  Don't you agree?  If you look at the top right-hand corner, it says: (Kinyarwanda spoken), which is the 28th of October 1992.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I don't know the date on which this letter was drafted.  I wasn't present when it was written, so I therefore cannot confirm the date. 
Q.	I will simply read the letter, that may be a bit faster, Mr. Witness.  These are fairly simple and straight forward questions.  I don't see what the problem is.  The letter is dated the 28th of October 1992.  The subject is MRND meeting held in Ruhengeri préfecture on the 15th of November 1992.  It is addressed to MRND chairman of all communes.  It is signed.  It goes out under the name of Dr. Casimir Bizimungu, who's the MRND chairman for Ruhengeri préfecture, signed by Charles Hategekimana, the MRND executive secretary in Ruhengeri préfecture.  There is a seal of the MRND party at the bottom.  
And this is what the letter says, Mr. Witness: "Militant, I hereby wish to inform you that important decisions taken at the meeting held on Sunday, the 18th of October 1992, bringing together -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, may the Prosecutor slow down a little bit. 
MR. WEBSTER:
(Microphone not activated) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Thank you, sir. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	"I hereby wish to inform you that important decisions taken at the meeting held on Sunday, 
	the 18th of October 1992, bringing together members of the Ruhengeri préfecture MRND committee and MRND commune chairman, include the holding of a broad based meeting in Ruhengeri préfecture on Sunday, 15 November 1992.  This meeting will take place at the Ruhengeri regional stadium starting at 9 a.m. sharp.  

"Dear Militant, I urge you to convene meetings and display the press releases attached to this letter across the commune so that MRND militants take necessary steps to be ready on that day.  

"Dear Militant, I urge you to already consider ways and means that will enable you to attend the meeting.  In addition, on that day we must demonstrate the force of our party in spades.  Long live peace and unity within the MRND."  

And if you look at the lower left-hand corner, Mr. Witness, you will see that this letter was copied to Interahamwe presidents in the communes, all in Ruhengeri.  Wouldn't this letter, going out on the 28th of October 1992, suggest to you that Casimir Bizimungu, the president of the MRND party in Ruhengeri, and his executive secretary, Charles -- Mr. Charles Hategekimana, were interested in preparing that rally on the 15th of November 1992 with the assistance of the MRND Interahamwe presidents at the level of the communes in Ruhengeri? 
A.	I thank you, Mr. President.  As has been read out by the Prosecutor from this letter, it's obvious that it was addressed to members of the MRND committee at préfecture and commune levels.  

But I have already explained that in so far as this letter of the 28th of October 1992 is concerned, I am not in a position to make comments on it because I was not present.  And at the time it wasn't the MRND party alone that organised rallies.  All other parties prepared rallies whereby they could recruit members in order to face the other political parties.  That exercise therefore was not carried out by the MRND alone.  It therefore cannot be interpreted as proof that the MRND was preparing anything.  This is a rally that was organised within the framework of the recruitment of members, as was the case with the other political parties.  
Q.	My point to you, Mr. Witness, is that this letter was sent to MR -- to Interahamwe presidents at the level of the commune throughout the préfecture of Ruhengeri, and that was done on the 
	28th of October 1992.  So in fact the Interahamwe in Ruhengeri had assisted in the preparation of that rally or were intended to assist in the preparation of that rally, wouldn't you agree? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I will repeat to the Prosecutor that this letter was not addressed to me.  He himself has just read out the names of the addressees.  I therefore could not have been personally informed about it because it was never sent to me.  I therefore am in no position to confirm what is said in the letter. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, may I have this admitted please. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I have an issue about this letter concerning disclosure.  And I would like to ask the witness to remove his headphones -- have you ask the witness to remove his headphones so we can deal with it. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Witness.  Could you remove your headphones, please. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Perhaps the first step would be for Mr. Webster to confirm that the document had not been disclosed to us until this bundle was prepared because -- maybe I'm in error, but on this side I've never seen the document before.  But since there are many documents -- to give the benefit of the doubt maybe Mr. Webster can indicate if this has been disclosed at any earlier time than in this bundle. 
MR. WEBSTER:
My recollection is that the letter was -- was disclosed in the bundle some time last week, Your Honour. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well then, Mr. President, I would make a motion.  I have to go back and look at my numbers to see which Rule 66 violation this is, perhaps 22nd motion for Rule 66(B) violation.  

But this is a document that should have been disclosed to us when it was -- shortly after it was received, since it's material to the preparation of the Defence.  And we have requested, going back until July of 2002, all documents pertaining to acts of MRND members.  

So I don't see how the Prosecutor, when he obtained this document from the commune office or the préfectoral office, earlier this year or last year, could have failed to disclose the document to us without violating Rule 66(B).  And in light of that disclosure I would ask -- that disclosure violation, I would make a formal motion that this document be not admitted into evidence and that all questions about the document put to this witness be stricken and disregarded.
Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Perhaps the most expeditious way of dealing with this is waiting until the completion of the examination to admit it, Your Honour.  I recall that Mr. Robinson did make requests some time ago -- years ago about MRND documents.  I don't recall the specific wording of the request, but we satisfied his inspection request years ago.  

This is a document that we received for the first time within the last three or four months.  There was no specific request for this -- for documents pertaining to Ruhengeri meetings in the last 
three or four months.  

It's a simple document.  We have thousands of documents from the MRND in our data base.  Mr. Robinson benefits from the EDS.  This document is in the EDS.  It's not an exculpatory document.  It is simply one of many thousands of documents that pertain to the MRND party.  

So I fail to see how this is a violation of Rule 66(B).  And if this is going to take an inordinate time, we can wait until I've completed my examination and I'll move it into evidence at that point and we can debate the issues of whether it is admissible or not. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, this is going to be a recurring problem if there are any documents that have been recovered in the last year, or at any time, that haven't been disclosed to us concerning the MRND party or the Interahamwe.  

I can't believe that Mr. Webster would think that that's not material to our defence under Rule 66(B).  And I think that I would ask that no reference be made to any such document with any of our witnesses until first we've had disclosure of all of those documents.  And at that time maybe Mr. Webster can make an application to recall some of our witnesses if the -- it's found not to have violated Rule 66(B).  

But it's not fair for him to ambush the Defence in this way and to profit from that ambush by even questioning the witness about it, let alone admitting the exhibit. 
MR. WEBSTER:
You know this is hardly a question of ambush.  The witness is not mentioned in the document.  The document is rather generic.  What's interesting about the document is who it is copied to.  On its face the document is -- is -- is not -- it doesn't inculpate anyone.  It's simply the announcement of a meeting.  

The document was received for the first time within the last three or four months.  It was disclosed 
for -- at least by some time last week, if not before.  I don't have the records in front of me.  But this is not a disclosure issue. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We think that we're going to need to consider this issue.  And we also think it may be preferable to receive submissions in writing on it.  How much time would you need to do that?  

Mr. Robinson, obviously you're the applicant.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I'm a little busy at the moment, but I think I can try to do it before the end of the week.  

I had to go through all of it -- I've written maybe 50 letters requesting Rule 66(B) disclosure.  It's going to take me a little while to go through all those letters, but I would say by Friday I can do it. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, what would you need to do to respond?  
MR. WEBSTER:
After the weekend, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Does that mean Monday?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, the Rules give us five days.  Tuesday would be fine.  If the Court wants the response by Monday, we could do it. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, I asked when could you do it.  And I was just trying to -- just trying to interpret what you said. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Tuesday, please. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, do you wish a right of reply?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, I would maybe ask for Thursday -- for Friday of next week to reply.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Issa.
MR. MJUI:
Your Honour, I'd like to make a correction.  I mentioned the last document -- Prosecution Exhibit as 
	P. 355.  That was wrong.  It's supposed -- supposed to be P. 354.  Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Issa. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, for the clarity of the record let me identify three other documents that would fall under the same category.  They're all included in that tab of my exhibit bundle.  

The next one is dated the 2nd of September 1992, which is another document which was sent out under the name of Casimir Bizimungu, that was copied to Interahamwe presidents at level of commune in Ruhengeri.  A third document is dated the 5th of October 1992.  It's the next document in the bundle.  Similarly, it was sent -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Please slow down, Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Similarly, it was sent by Dr. Casimir Bizimungu or his executive secretary.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Excuse me.  

My learned colleague, the interpreters are unable to follow with you.  Could you please slow down for them to interpret properly into French. 
MR. WEBSTER:
The third document is dated the 5th of October 1992.  It is also signed by Carol -- or 
	Charles Hategekimana or Casimir Bizimungu.  It was copied to Interahamwe presidents at the level of the commune in Ruhengeri.  

These are three documents from 1992 which were all copied to Interahamwe presidents.  I would seek to move all three into evidence so that our application -- or Mr. Robinson's application can be addressed to all three documents. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  

What we'll order now -- we will order that the submissions with regard to those documents be presented in accordance with the schedule agreed by -- between the parties.  

In the meantime, Mr. Webster, we'll allow you to continue. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  Thank you.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, were there marches or demonstrations organised by your group or by the Interahamwe in 1992? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Marches and demonstrations took place, but these were not exclusively made by the Interahamwe.  And I -- allow me to remind the Chamber that these demonstrations took place all over the entire national territory when -- the hour during which the president of the republic addressed the nation. 
Q.	Are you referring to a series of demonstrations that were nationwide that were a means of the 
	MRND party protesting the removal of President Habyrimana's flash -- the flash of his speech or his addresses that would either precede or follow reports of the national news; is that what you are referring to, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Yes, I'm talking about those demonstrations because these are the only demonstrations which I know took place nationwide and which brought together all the members of the population. 
Q.	And your group participated in Mukingo commune, isn't that correct? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  You're continuing to assist on the fact that members of the association allegedly attended or took part in that demonstration, but I'd like to point to the Chamber that this was an individual act.  We did not participate in it as a group.  And I would like you -- I'd like to state that there may have been one or other of our association, but they were not participating in their capacity as members of our association.  And these were not demonstrations that had been prepared by our association. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, I'd like to confront you with a bit of evidence that was received in this Trial.  It came before this Tribunal as D. NZ652.  And there's a paragraph in that document, which is a report made by one of the persons that you're familiar with, that was a member of your organisation.  And, according to him, on the 6th of July 1992 is when Interahamwe held demonstrations in Bigamo (phonetic), 
	Busogo secteur, Rwankeri cellule.  They blocked the Ruhengeri-Gisenyi road and other small roads that connected the highway from Ruhengeri to Gisenyi.  And the reason that they did so was that political parties had removed the president's speech on Radio Rwanda which aired shortly before the news.  What do you have to say about that, Mr. Witness? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  If the witness could take off his headphones again so that I can make an objection that would not influence his testimony. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please remove your headphones. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I believe that Mr. Webster has incorrectly characterised this witness.  He claimed that -- we're now speaking about the witness who immediately preceded this witness.  And Mr. Webster said that that witness was a member of his association.  That witness never testified to being a member of his association.  I don't believe any other witness has ever claimed that Witness 2, the author of that report, was a member of the association.  

So Mr. Webster has given false information to the witness as a premise for his question.  I would ask that he be ordered to correct it. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Would the Defence prefer that I provide the witness's name?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I don't think you need to do that, but you can describe the witness by his position.  But can we both agree that the witness was not a member of his association, as you have stated in your question?  Then we can make some progress from there. 
MR. WEBSTER:
What we can agree on is that the witness does not -- the witness who provided this information did not claim to be a member of that group, but a number of other witnesses have claimed that that person was a member of the group, which is why I mentioned it in that way to avoid saying his name.  But I 
	can go -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Can I make a suggestion.  Mr. Webster.  Why don't you simply write the witness's name -- write the person's name, show it to the witness and we'll admit that document into evidence. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  That's fine. 

What I'm going to refer to is document -- what has been admitted in evidence as D. NZ136. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You can put back on your headphones. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	I'm going to refer to a document that's in evidence as D. NZ136.  On the last page of that document there are a list of names, Mr. Witness.  And number 14 on that list is the person that provided this information.  

So if Mr. Issa could just show this document to the Judges and then to the witness and then bring it back to me.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. Webster.  That document that was shown to us, did you say that was D. NZ136?  
MR. WEBSTER:
That's correct. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
That doesn't conform to my understanding of what is D. NZ136.  

Perhaps when Mr. Issa returns to his desk, he can tell us if that is indeed D. NZ136.  If -- the document you showed me doesn't have an exhibit marked on it and my records -- or actually Mr. Issa's records show that document D. NZ136 is a Gacaca document from Ruhengeri prison dated 22 November 1999. 
MR. WEBSTER:
That, indeed, is the document that we're referring to.  I refer to the last page of that document.  The 
	last page of D. NZ136 is a list of names, so that's what I'm showing to the witness.  The last page of 
	D. NZ136, it was admitted in French and admitted in Kinyarwanda.  And what Mr. Issa has is the 
	last page of the French translation of that document. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, looking at the person identified as number 14 on that list, simply to rephrase my 
	last question, that person provided information to this Court that the Interahamwe organised demonstrations and blocked the road sometime in July of 1992.  

So my question to you again is:  Wasn't your group or the Interahamwe engaged in political activities back in 1992? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I believe that witness lied.  He lied because in 1992 our organisation or 
	that -- those Interahamwe they're referring to had no role to play in manning roadblocks.  My statement is therefore that the statement he provided to this Chamber to the fact that Interahamwe blocked the road is false. 
Q.	Thank you.  We'll move on.  Mr. Witness, in responding to Mr. Nimy's question last week, you told us that Joseph Nzirorera had never ordered the Interahamwe or your group, the group that you identify as ************, to take down PSD flags.  It was not clear from your answer if you never did such things or if it was just a question of Joseph Nzirorera never ordering you to do such things, which is it? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I'd insist before the Chamber that Nzirorera never issued such an order.  But you claim that a flag was taken down, taken away, but I can't see where that happened.  The PSD flag I know was in Byangabo and when -- while we're fleeing that flag was still hoisted at that place.  So I don't know what flag you are referring to. 
Q.	My question to you is:  Did you and your group ever harass or violently attack opposition parties in Ruhengeri préfecture in 1992 or 1993? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  That never happened.  We -- it never prosecuted members of other parties.  Those parties were authorised to conduct the activities in the country and at no point in time did we harass members of other parties. 
MR. WEBSTER:
	I'd like us to look at another document.  This is a document that was circulated on Friday by email, and for which I provided hard copies to the Defence earlier today and to interpreters in their booths and to CMS for the court.  It is a document dated the 18th of January 1993.  And there is an unofficial English translation on the last page that is appended to that document.  

MR. ROBINSON: 
And, Mr. President, can Mr. Webster confirm that this is also a document in the same category as the three he's previously identified for which he violated Rule 66(B)?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I think Mr. Robinson would have to clarify how this violates Rule 66(B).  His previous application concerned MRND documents.  This is a document from the préfecture, the commune of Nyakinama in Ruhengeri préfecture. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, as I'll indicate in my motion, on the 2nd of July 2002 I sent a letter asking the Prosecutor to disclose all evidence he had concerning acts of the MRND members and acts of the Interahamwe.  And this document clearly relates to evidence of acts of Interahamwe.  

But I think if this is a document that was disclosed to us before this weekend, there's no problem.  But I'm not aware of that.  This looks like a document that falls into the same category that Mr. Webster collected and secreted until springing it on the witness after he had completed his direct examination.  If that's the case, in my opinion, it'll fall within the written motion I wish to make. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We didn't want to be in the position of having to rule on oral submissions at this stage.  So it might be sufficient to just indicate that it can be included in the motion. 
MR. WEBSTER:
That's fine, Your Honour.  But I would like to go into the content of the document so the witness can have an opportunity to respond right now. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We have permitted you to do that.  Our ruling will address it in due course if necessary. 
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.  Thank you. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, I have here a report that was sent by Sous-Préfet Kitano Gitan (phonetic) -- was the sous-préfet of Ruhengeri and was the interim bourgmestre of Nyakinama commune back in January 1993.  Do you know that person or have you ever heard of that person? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I don't know that person. 
Q.	Well, I'd indicate for the record that this is a document that bears a seal at the bottom of the page and this is K0458868.  It was obtained from -- I believe, it was the Nyakinama commune office sometime earlier this year.  It's a report from the sous-préfet addressed to the préfet of Ruhengeri.  

And I'm going to read his cover letter in French, since we only have the French original for the first page:  "With reference to your letter number 1563/04 of 10th December 1992, we have the honour of transmitting" -- "of forwarding to you a report of political activities and rallies, which took place at the communal secteur level since the 1st January 1992 to the 31st December 1992."  

And attached to that letter, Mr. Witness, is a report that is three pages in length, and the last page of that report, in the middle of the page, there is a notation at paragraph 5 which says "PSD".  

And I'm going to continue in English now with the unofficial translation:  "The PSD held a meeting in Kabare commune on the 11th of October 1992."  And then below that, it says "NB", which I assume is nota bene, no conflicts between political parties and no speech delivered that could have been the origin of conflicts except a group of people (from Mukingo commune) in Interahamwe attire who came to threaten MDR party leaders in Kabare one and Kitabuya (phonetic) secteurs on the 
27th of September 1992 during the day and the prosecutor's office is handling the case." 

Now having heard that written report, do you have any recollection of members of your group, who others may refer to, or have referred to, as the Interahamwe, engaged in political activities in attacking opposition parties in 1992? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I don't -- I haven't noted anything concrete from this report because in the Mukingo commune you are referring to in the Kabare area, and allow me to state that there's a distance between -- 70 kilometres between Kabare and Mukingo.  

There's nothing that shows that we came there on board a vehicle to go there or whether we checked into that place, because in my view that would be a group of people who would have been noticed.  

A while ago we were talking about MDR party, but before we have been talking about the PSD.  So I wonder if these people were members of the MDR or PSD.  As far as I am aware, I would like to say that all of this information is not correct because I was never aware of such activity and for the reasons I have stated -- I just stated I would state (inaudible). 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, just to clarify matters for you, I'm not suggesting that this report documents the incident -- the specific incident that Mr. Nimy asked you about last week.  I'm assuming that he asked you about that incident because other Prosecution witnesses have talked about that specific incident.  

My question to you is more general, because here we have a report that was sent out in 
January of 1993 that seems to document Interahamwe, or dressed in Interahamwe uniform, committing violent acts against other opposition political parties in 1992.  So my question to you is general, but I assume your answer is the same, if you'd like to modify your answer you may do so.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I understand that you lent credence to your witnesses.  Whereas, I have stated before Nyakinama is far from where I live.  And I am talking to you about my area.  There was no threat against any other party and parties conducted their activities as they wished and since they were authorised to conduct such activities all over the country.

0950H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Well, we'll move on to something else, Mr. Witness.  

Didn't you, yourself, previously testify that there were Interahamwe, MRND in Mukingo commune by 
at least February 1993?  Didn't you tell another Trial Chamber that some three or four years ago?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Unless I'm mistaken, this has to do with the (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and kept under separate cover) trial which has been concluded.  I cannot remember stating in that trial -- I cannot remember what I stated there. 
Q.	Well, let's look at it together, Mr. Witness.  And I would direct everyone to -- 
A.	Six years ago. 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)...of our bundle, where there are a number of excerpts from this witness's testimony (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover).  And we'll start with what I've identify as excerpt number 1, which is two pages in English -- three pages in English and then a number of other pages in French.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me.  What tab was that?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
It's tab G and it's the second document in.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER:
And excerpt 1 contains both the English and the French.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, you've already told us that your sworn testimony before another Trial Chamber was given willingly and to the best of your ability and truthfully and accurately, isn't that so? 
A.	Thank you.  Yes, I made a solemn declaration.  But as I just stated a while ago, it's been about five or six years and I no longer remember what I said, and that's what I just stated to the Court -- to Chamber. 
Q.	Well, let me read it to you, Mr. Witness.  (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover).  The question was put to you:  

"Could you tell this Chamber, how was the Interahamwe formed in Busogo secteur, as far as you know?"  

And your response, Mr. Witness, was as follows:  "We heard Interahamwe mentioned during a meeting or rally which was presided by Major General Juvénal Habyarimana on the 15th of November 1992.  During that rally the president of the republic explained what the Interahamwe were, as well as their activities."

Now, that seems consistent with what you've told us with your testimony on Thursday and early this morning, Mr. Witness.  But you go on in your response to that previous Trial Chamber.  You state (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover):  

"We would meet at Busogo, in a football pitch, and after this speech the person known as Niyoyita, Damascéne came to where we were and he said that all youths age 18 and above could register within the MRND party because a youth wing was going to be set up in our region.

"After the speech made by the president of the republic, all the youths expressed their wish of belonging to this youth wing."  

Further down in your testimony you state, "I do not remember the date, but I recall that it was in February 1993."  

You were asked:  "Do you recall when he came to see you?  Who was the bourgmestre then in Mukingo?"  And your response was that it was, "Assiel Ndisetse who was bourgmestre of Mukingo."

You state (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover), in response to the question, "Did there come a time when the Interahamwe was formed?"  

Your response was, "All the youth who had listened to the president of the republic's speech joined the Interahamwe or rallied with it.  The Interahamwe as a body was not operational in our region as yet, but some youths expressed the wish of belonging to this youth wing.  Even those who were members of the MRND youth wing abandoned it in order to join the Interahamwe wing."  

That's not quite what you told us on Thursday, is it?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  That excerpt shows that -- that youth never functioned in an organised manner.  What I'm saying is that that youth never functioned.  But the Prosecutor is stating that the Interahamwe was functional.  But you realise that in my previous statements I have said that the Interahamwe was not functional.  

I stated to the Chamber that Niyoyita came and told us to set up an MRND youth wing.  But we did not accept -- agree with this.  I explained to the Chamber that this never materialised.  I, therefore, did not confirm that those Interahamwe were operational.  And that is why -- what I insist on today. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, at (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover), you were asked:  "Now, could you tell the Chamber what became" -- and there's a slight interruption, "what became of the Interahamwe in Busogo?"  Your answer, Mr. Witness, (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover):

Question to you, Mr. Witness, "How did you attain that position of (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover), he talked to us about conditions being 18 and above, having good conduct and good morals.  There were some of our members who accepted to join the Interahamwe, myself included, and others, especially those who assisted me.  I was chairman and the other members, as well as myself, joined the Interahamwe but among the **************************, there were some who did not want to belong to both the *************** and the Interahamwe."  

But based on that response, Mr. Witness, wouldn't you agree that back in 2002 when you were giving sworn testimony, you described the Interahamwe as having been set up by the (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover), isn't that so?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  You understand that there's an explanation.  Later -- if I said that I joined the Interahamwe subsequently, I explained that this did not take us like that, you know, vis-à-vis our membership with ***********.  And what is more, Niyoyita did not force us to become members of the Interahamwe youth wing.  He asked us to join it of our own volition.  He said that the members of *************** who had good morals, who had good conduct, could join the MRND party.  

In the meantime, well, the Prosecutor is putting a question to me whereby he's asking me if I became a member of the Interahamwe group.  I would say, rather, that I became member of the MRND as a party.  So that will be my explanation to that question. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, my recollection is that last Thursday you told us that there was no Interahamwe in Mukingo commune, that it was only in April of 1994 that members of your community identified the killers in Mukingo as Interahamwe and confused your group with persons they described as Interahamwe.  

Your response today is quite different.  Prodded by your previous testimony back in 2002 you're now acknowledging that by -- at least by February of 1993 there was a group that was set up in Mukingo commune under the auspices of the MRND party; isn't that so?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  The Prosecutor is relying on a portion of the document and he doesn't want to look at the document in its entirety because at the end of the document that he is relying on I give the explanation that Interahamwe did not exist.  And yet it is in that last portion of the document that I explained that the members of our association joined the MRND party and not the youth wing of the party, that is, the Interahamwe.  

The Prosecutor is relying on the portion where it is mentioned that Niyoyita came to contact us, unless in order to make the Trial Chamber believe that we joined the Interahamwe.  But I would like to recall that Niyoyita asked us to join the MRND party of our own volition.  He did not compel us to do so.  Membership, therefore, was conditional or was contingent on each person's wish that was a member of our association.  So we joined the MRND party, like any other member of the population. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, let me refer you to an earlier portion of your testimony before that very same Trial Chamber (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover).  And on a page that I do not have in my bundle, (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover), you're asked if and when you joined the MRND party.  The question put to you was, "Did you belong to a political party in April of 1994?  And what party was that?"  And your answer was, "I was a member of the MRND."  

You were asked, "When did you become -- when did you become a member of the MRND?"  And you said, "In 1992."  Did you -- you were asked if you received a membership card and you said, "Quite so, I had a card."  You explained that the card was issued to you by the chairman of the MRND in Mukingo commune, and you gave the name of that person as Niyoyita, which is the same person we've been discussing.  

But there's a difference here because you claimed to have joined the MRND party in 1992, (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) you became a part of the Interahamwe in February of 1993.  So at least (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) you made a distinction between those two.  Do you have anything to say about that?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I believe I have already given exhaustive explanations to this.  I have explained that even if the Interahamwe were at the youth association of the MRND, they were two distinct entities.  I, therefore, joined the MRND, just as 95 percent of the Rwandan population did.  

The Prosecutor goes on to say that in 1994 I joined the Interahamwe, but in this portion I explained that Niyoyita claimed to contact us to join the Interahamwe, but up until 1994 that had not been effective yet.  Now, regarding my membership of the MRND party, I do confirm this.  And membership cards were given out, as was the case with other political parties. 
Q.	Let's go on to something else, Mr. Witness.  

Again (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover), you were asked, "Now, how many members were there of the Interahamwe during the time when you *********************************?"  And your response, "There were 31 of us as members."  

Well, Mr. Witness, my question to you now is:  Do you think you would be able to write down some, if not all, of the 31 members that you had in mind when you gave that evidence (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover)?  Do you think you could remember some of those 31 people who had joined the Interahamwe back in February of 1993?  
A.	I thank you, Mr. President.  I can remember a few names.  Probably I can very easily give you up to 20 names.  If you give me a sheet of paper I can do that.  I'm prepared to do that. 
Q.	We'll do that.  But I have a suggestion for you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
And I would like Mr. Issa to show this sheet of paper to the Judges and to the other parties and then we'll proceed.  
 
Your Honours, what I have written down on that sheet of paper are the names that were recorded by another witness, the witness that we discussed earlier, number 14 on the last page of D. NZ136.  And what I would like to propose to the witness is that he cross off any name that should not be there, and that he add any name that he can remember so that we have as complete a listing of the 31 people that he claims were members of the Interahamwe back in February of 1993.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, I have no objection to that, I think if it would save us some time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
So if the document could be displayed to the witness and he could be given a pen.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And let me repeat my instructions to you, Mr. Witness, so that we're clear.  What I'm asking you to do is look at the names that are already on this piece of paper.  If there is any name that should not be there, just cross it off.  Because I want what's recorded on the paper to reflect your understanding of the persons that were a member of your group.  And after crossing off any name that shouldn't be there, you go ahead and list additional names.  
A.	Mr. President, I have already indicated on this sheet of paper the names of the members of the Interahamwe organisation.  I'm talking about those that I can remember today. 
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.  Could we have this moved into evidence, please, and shown to the Court and the other parties.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, while we're doing that, does Mr. Webster want to admit excerpt number 1 from the (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and kept under separate cover) transcript as an exhibit?  And if he does, perhaps we could admit that so we have these exhibits in order.  I also do not object to the list being admitted either. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I do plan to move the excerpt into evidence.  I was simply trying to save time by pushing ahead and doing it at the end, but we can do that now as well.  So excerpt 1 can be moved into evidence and followed by this list, and then we'll maintain the sequence, which may assist us later on.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does Mr. Issa have the excerpt?  Does the registrar have the document?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
They have a copy in a bundle, yes.  
 
And let me hand up to Mr. Issa (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover), which was not included in the bundle, but now that will be the entire portion that we discussed with the witness just a few moments ago. 
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, your testimony back on Thursday was that your group did not commit acts of violence before April of 1994.  Is that still your evidence?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Some members of our association might have taken part in such acts, but I confirm that as an association per se we never took part in such acts prior to April 1994. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Mr. Issa, could I see that list that the witness prepared, please?  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you were being examined by Mr. Nimy at some point you talked about a certain witness in this trial, someone that you knew personally that had provided you information, or had concocted information with you.  Now, there's a witness in this case who initially testified for the Prosecution but who later claimed that his evidence (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) and Nzirorera was given falsely, and deliberately so, when he first testified and then he came back before this very same Trial Chamber in April of 2008 and he claimed to now be giving truthful evidence.  

Do you know anything about that?  And for this question I would like you to answer only yes or no because I'm trying to protect the record.  So I just want to understand from you if you have in mind a certain individual in relation to the information I've just given you.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I could answer by a yes or no, but I feel compelled to give some explanations.  I have said that there are many people who came and gave evidence for the Prosecution and that such evidence or testimonies were fabricated. 
Q.	You're going to have ample opportunity to explain yourself.  I'm not trying to stop you from saying anything, but I'm trying to be very clear about what -- I'm trying to be very clear in the questions I'm asking you.  So if you have a certain person in mind, just say yes or no and then we'll allow to you complete your explanation a little later on.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  This is a really bad way of doing it for the record because we're all guessing at who he's talking about.  Can he write down on a piece of paper or give us the number of the name that he's referring to and then ask -- then we'll all know who he's talking about, without doing it this way. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
That's my next step, Your Honour.  If Mr. Robinson would be patient for a few minutes, it will all be clear.  I do have a name written down, but I don't want to suggest it to the witness.  I want it to come -- I want the witness to acknowledge that he has someone in mind first. 
MR. ROBINSON:
But, you know, Mr. President, by doing this we're disclosing the identity of a witness to this witness.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
That's why I'm asking the witness, does this information provoke anything, any response from him?  That's what I'm trying to ascertain. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The witness can answer the question.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Can you answer the question now, Mr. Witness?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Can the Prosecutor kindly repeat his question?  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Do you know anything about a person who testified in this trial several years ago and then came back to court and changed his testimony and claimed that his previous testimony had been delivered falsely?  Do you know anything about that? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  My answer is yes. 
Q.	I have a name written down on a piece of paper and I would like you -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
I would like Mr. Issa to show it to the Chamber and to the parties and then I will ask a question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Issa.  Mr. Webster, why don't you let the witness write the name down. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay.  If Mr. Issa could give him a sheet of paper and have him give us the information.  
 
If you could show that to the Court and the parties, please.  

BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  Mr. Witness, you'll agree with me that the name that you just wrote down -- and if we could move that in evidence so that we can keep track of the documentation, under seal. 
MR. ROBINSON:
No objection.
MR. MJUI: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  The excerpts from (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and kept under separate cover) transcript would be P. 355, and the list of the names will be P. 356, and the name would be P. 357.  Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. P. 355 admitted) 
(Exhibit No. P. 356 admitted) 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Only the last one needs to be under seal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The last one is under seal. 
(Exhibit No. P. 357 admitted, under seal) 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you'll agree with me that the name that you wrote on Exhibit 357 is also included on your list which we've identified for the record as 356, right?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  That is true.  But I would like to make a correction here.  I maintain that the names that I've given are the names of members of the association that was engaged in farming and stock breeding and that they are not members of the Interahamwe association. 
Q.	They are the names of persons you identify as belonging to the *************************, right?  Just for the clarity of the record.  
A.	That is correct, yes. 
Q.	And that's the same organisation you were referring to (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) when you described them as Interahamwe, right? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  That, indeed, is what I gave as (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover). 
Q.	Thank you.  We'll move on.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's about 10:30.  Is this a convenient time?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, it is Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll take our mid morning recess now for 15 minutes. 
(Court recessed from 1027H to 1047H) 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Mr. Issa, could I begin by asking you to place in front of the witness the list of names that he generated.  I believe it's 357, it may be 356, but clarify that for me, please.  What number?  This is P. 356.  If we could place that in front of the witness.  And then, Your Honours, just so that the record is clear, if I could ask the Court to mark for identification the four documents that are the subject of the motion that Mr. Robinson will be filing.  And I would request that they be identified as follows:  

The letter of the 28th of October 1992 which is K number K0458875 be marked as IP. 41.  The letter of the 2nd of September 1992, which is K0458879, be marked as IP. 42.  The letter of the 5th of October 1992, which is K0458877, be marked as IP. 43.  And the letter of the 1st of -- excuse me, of the 18th of January 1993, which is K0458868, be marked as IP. 44, just so that we don't lose track of them. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We mark those documents for identification as requested. 
 (Exhibit No. IP. 41 marked for identification)
(Exhibit No. IP. 42 marked for identification)
(Exhibit No. IP. 43 marked for identification)
(Exhibit No. IP. 44 marked for identification)
MR. WEBSTER: 
And then for the Court and the parties, I'm going to be referring to transcripts that are at tab HI in our bundle.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, we finished up this morning where you had given us the name of a person that you knew to have given false evidence, or supposedly false evidence and then to have come back to court to correct that.  Are we on the same track, Mr. Witness?  If you could just say yes or no for now.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I do recall. 
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, when this particular person was testifying for the second time in April of 2008, he was asked a number of questions by Mr. Robinson on behalf of the Nzirorera Defence.  And at this stage of the game he was, in his view, giving accurate information, reliable information, and was actually correcting what he claims was the false information he had given several years previously.  So I'm only referring now to the evidence that was given to this Court in April of 2008, which was to correct all of this witness's previous information.  And this particular witness was asked at page 24 of the English transcripts, which are pages 32 to 33 in the French transcripts, whether there were Interahamwe in Mukingo commune.  
And his answer was:  "Personally, I would say that there were no real Interahamwes in the Mukingo commune.  There was militia, that's true, but it was not a militia that was legally recognised.  And the national organs of the Interahamwes were not represented when the militia was founded.  So I can say that there were no real Interahamwes in the Mukingo commune, although there was a militia there."  

Do you agree with that response, Mr. Witness?  That particular piece of information, is it consistent with your understanding of what obtained in Mukingo commune? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  This is the same question that I answered, I gave to Mr. Nimy when he questioned me with respect to the existence of the Interahamwe in the Mukingo commune.  
Q.	I think I understand you, Mr. Witness, that you and this particular witness who testified on the 10th of April 2008 seemed to agree that there were no formally organised Interahamwe.  But the witness I'm referring to referred to that group as a militia.  And he goes on, in response to the question, "And who was the head of the militia that you're referring to?"  And he identifies that person as **********************

He continues.  He's asked, "When was that particular organisation formed?"  And he says, "Sometime between 1991 and 1994."  And claims that he no longer remembers precisely.  That's on page 25 in the English.   So this person seems to think that this militia existed well before 1993.  Do you have anything to say about that, Mr. Witness?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  He may be referring to a militia, but what I know is at the time there were people who had deserted the army and who were -- who were creating insecurity among the population.  And at some point in time military authorities organised a search for all those deserted who had come to hide in the countryside and who were a source of insecurity for the members of the population. 
Q.	And, Mr. Witness, this particular person was asked if he could give -- provide names of that militia.  And he provides certain names that I don't see on your list.  And I would like to ask you now if these are names that you would include on your list:  This person refers to a *******************************.  Do you know that person?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I know **********************. 
Q.	Would you agree that he was part of your group, whether you would call them **************** or the Interahamwe? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I forgot to mention his name on the list which I drew.  But it is, indeed, true that he was also a member of **********************. 
Q.	Would you add his name to the list now, please.  You have the list in front of you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, we know the name this time, right?
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry?
MR. PRESIDENT:  
We know the name he's written this time.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Won't it save time just for him to keep it and then you can show it. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
That's what I've asked to be done.  Leave the list with the witness and he will continue to add names.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	What about Dusabimana, was he a member of the group?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Dusabimana was not a member of ****************. 
Q.	So you don't have to add that name.  

What about Bagabo?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I think I should also include Bagabo's name on the list because he was a member of **************.  
Q.	Could you do that, please.  

What about Kwitonda, Pierre-Célestin?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Kwitonda was a motorcycle driver but he was not a member of our group.  
Q.	Okay.  So thank you, Mr. Witness.  We only add two more names.   

Now, this witness was asked, at page 32 in the English, which is pages 40 to 41 in the French text, "Prior to the death of President Habyarimana, can you tell us what acts of violence were committed by these people in Mukingo commune?  What did they do?"  And the response that this witness gave was, "That before President Habyarimana's death they beat up Bagogwes that they found on the road, and they also were going to Rudatinya, those people who are currently living in our area.  I also remember once that they went to fight against the Bagogwes, but the Bagogwes fled to ISAE, that is, the Higher Institute of Agriculture and Livestock."   That's what the person you've identified on P. 357 was telling this Court when he was making an extra effort to be truthful and to correct his previous evidence.  What do you have to say about that? 
(Pages 20 to 30 by Janice Dickman)




1100H
THE WITNESS:
A.	I thank you, Mr. President.  I agree with the Prosecutor, that those incidents indeed took place.  But I should explain here that it wasn't our association that carried out the attack.  Rather, it was a group of persons living in the locality which, off their own initiative, decided to go and assault the victims.  Those incidents took place before 1994 and the public prosecution department had to carry out an investigation.  And I think that the persons who were behind the incidents were prosecuted and punished. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, what I'm putting to you is that the person that you identified in P. 356, who you acknowledged as a member of your group back in 1992, 1993, 1994, claims that he was correcting his previously -- his previous testimony that was given falsely and was now giving truthful testimony and claims that this group were the ones that were responsible for attacking the Bagogwe and chasing them into ISAE.  So he sees it differently than you do.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Well, he's the only person who was bound by his own testimony.  I can't see it any other way.  I'm saying that that small group attacked those men.  Now, he's attributing those acts to our group, to our association, but I am well aware that there's a group of persons who were prosecuted by the public prosecution department.  And that is a group that was responsible for those acts.  And I know that that group confessed to their acts. 
Q.	Can we agree, Mr. Witness, that the attacks against the Bagogwe that led them to take refuge in ISAE took place in February of 1993?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Insofar as those events are concerned, we saw gendarmes who came to protect persons that -- the persons that were attacked.  That is what we heard.  I didn't follow the events closely to be able to tell you where they had taken refuge.  What I know is that when the gendarmes withdrew, the people were no longer attacked.  So, there was no other act of violence that was committed after the gendarmes left and went away. 
Q.	But what I'm trying to find out from you, Mr. Witness, is that this occurred in February of 1993.  Would you agree with that characterisation of the time or if you don't know just tell us you don't know? 
A.	I do not know if that was indeed the date.  It's information that was reported to me, because I was not an eyewitness to the incidents. 
Q.	Well, I'd like us to turn to an item in tab PQ of my bundle.  It is a sitrep from the ministry of defence.  I have it in French and in English.  Mr. Witness, since it is only in French, I'm going to read it to you rather than place it in front of you.  But at the very top of the first page, which is identified as L0020682, you can see that it's dated the 22nd February 1993.  It even gives the time that this document was generated, as 1529 from the état major of the gendarmerie.  And when you go towards the middle of the document, it identifies it as a sitrep of the 22nd of February 1993.  And then three-quarters of the way down the page, there is a notation that -- and I will read it in the English text:  "The director of ISAE Busogo has accepted to provide them with shelter at the request of Busogo nuns, and priests, and the bourgmestre of Mukingo who has been suspended."  And when it is referring to "they" it is referring to the 246 Tutsi from Rwinzove, Mukingo, which is at the top, the beginning of the paragraph.  

So I'm suggesting to you, Mr. Witness, on the basis of this document that was generated by the ministry of defence, that it was in late February 1993 that the Bagogwe were chased into ISAE.  I am also suggesting to you that it was during that same period, and after that event, that the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune was dismissed or suspended; do you have any reason to contest that information? 
A.	I thank you, Mr. President.  There is nothing I can say on the subject because it is a document that originated from high officials.  I wasn't informed that the refugees had taken refuge in the ISAE buildings. 
Q.	Didn't you just tell us that you were aware that the Bagogwe had been attacked and chased into the ISAE?  Wasn't that your response just five minutes ago? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I think the Prosecutor did not quite understand me.  He told me that there's a certain witness who talked about those attacks.  And I indeed confirmed that, yes, there were people that were attacked, but that subsequently the authorities concerned carried out investigations and punished the authors of the attacks.  So I think the previous question -- or, the preceding question is different from the one that had been put to me before.  

From the way I understand it, you were talking about two different attacks.  I am aware of the one that the witness we talked about mentioned. 
Q.	I'll move on.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I would like to have the sitrep admitted into evidence.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, if we could once again ask the witness to take his headphones off, because I have a problem with disclosure of this document.  

Mr. President, once again -- first of all, I did not believe that until it was included in this bundle that we had had disclosure of that document.  And if I am wrong about that I will apologise.  But if that is the case, and I think this is a violation of Rule 68, because the issue of (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and kept under separate cover) origination and responsibility for attacks on Tutsis prior to 1994 has been a very live issue in our case.  Other witnesses have been questioned about this.  And here, this is a document that says it was at his request, (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and kept under separate cover) request, that these Tutsis be sheltered at the ISAE in his commune.  

That is contrary to the evidence given by other Prosecution witnesses concerning (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and kept under separate cover) role in Mukingo commune in 1993.  That should have been disclosed to us under Rule 68.  It's not necessary that there be any request having been made for that.  And, once again, I would ask that Mr. Webster explain where and when he obtained the document; whether it was disclosed to us before this bundle and if not, why? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, ultimately, the Court is being asked to rule on whether this is a Rule 68 issue.  In our submission, it simply is not.  So there's no disclosure obligation, nor would there be any disclosure violation.  I have a way of characterising this information; Mr. Robinson may have his way of characterising this information, but it certainly does not rise to the level of Rule 68.  So, if the Court is not disposed to make a decision on the specific nature of this document now, we can include it in the motion practice that we have scheduled for next week.  But this is not a Rule 68 issue, and there was no disclosure obligation.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we agree that this could be included in the motion that we have already scheduled.  

Do you still have the same practice of marking the document for identification? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, I do.  I believe this would be IP. 46.  

Issa, can correct me if I am -- 
MR. MJUI:
The document will be IP. 45.
MR. WEBSTER:
Forty-five.  Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification.  
(Exhibit No. IP. 45 marked for identification)
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I am happy to do that, but I am going to ask that the trial be suspended until these issues of disclosure connected to this witness can be resolved.  This is not excluding the testimony of this witness.

If all these documents that Mr. Webster kept secret from us are now being exposed to this witness, and it is having an impact on his credibility, I do not see how you can unring that bell later.  It's not one or two documents now, it is an endemic problem.  I think it would be better to solve this issue and come back to this witness.  Maybe we could bring another witness, if we don't have the same problems with some other witnesses, and deal with it in the meantime.  But it's unfair to be ambushing this witness with all these documents that are disclosure violations.  And the remedy you have suggested, which is a wise one, it still is prejudicing us if the testimony is allowed to continue in the meantime.  Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, of course, the Prosecution would oppose that application.  This is hardly the type of issue that should interrupt this witness's testimony.  

This is simply a document, a sitrep from 1993, that mentions an incident.  It hardly gives it any characterisation at all.  How this could take the witness by unfair surprise is beyond me.  I'm simply trying to clarify a chronology, for the record, based on information that is coming from contemporaneously generated documents, so that we can relate to documents in order to put things in chronological order as opposed to witness testimony.  So this is certainly not an issue that would fall under Rule 68 or would give rise to this type of application. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, disclosure rules are made so that the parties are not surprised, so that we can prepare our own case, prepare our own witnesses.  What is happening here is that the witness is being confronted with documents that our Defence team has not had any access to.  And if I'm right that we should have had access to them, then this pollutes the procedure and the witness is being ambushed, and the Defence is being ambushed unfairly.  

I think it's not right to continue the testimony of the witness and allow him to be ambushed like this until you have resolved the issue of whether or not there was, in fact, a disclosure violation.  I'm ready to argue that orally, if that's a better solution.  I'm happy also to make my argument in writing.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. Robinson, we don't think that your application for suspension is an appropriate remedy whatever the position is.  If you do need time, it would be time to conduct redirect.  And at that stage we would consider an application if you make it.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I wouldn't be conducting redirect on documents which have been excluded.  I would probably be opening the door to them being then admitted.  I think the remedy will either be striking testimony that has already been given or allowing things to stand as they are. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That would be part of what we would consider when we receive your written submissions.  I presume that would then be included in your presentation to us. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, the remedy would be.  You would be asking to unring the bell.  Aren't you disturbed that after everything that's gone on in this case with disclosure that the Prosecution would collect the MRND and Interahamwe documents and documents relating to Mukingo commune and what happened there, and they would hide those documents and not disclose them?  And in -- regardless of technically whether they may fall under 68, 66, well, I myself am really, really surprised after everything that's been litigated in this case concerning disclosure that Mr. Webster would have the idea in his head that that was a good thing to do, to hide these documents and not disclose them.  

Even if, technically, they would turn out not to be disclosable, it seems like the prudent thing to have done would be to have disclosed them so you do not have these problems.  And you are now, in a sense, rewarding Mr. Webster for that kind of conduct by allowing the testimony to continue.  I think it would be better to punish him or at least suspend things in the light of the situation until you can determine from our motion whether or not the document should be excluded.  But by continuing with the witness and having these things affect his credibility, even if it is later somehow you are asked to pretend that it did not take place, you're condoning this kind of thing.  And I think that that's really going in the wrong direction.  So I would ask that you really -- or, I can bring another witness, if it's necessary, if you're concerned about losing time.  But I really don't think it is fair to continue to proceed and reward this kind of situation that we find ourselves in.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I would like to add a little bit to what Mr. Robinson has said.  

This is a recurrent problem.  First of all, the Prosecutor should have, at the time he was presenting his evidence, he should have disclosed the entirety of all the evidentiary material that the Prosecution intended to use.  Now, he's waiting for the Defence to start presenting its case to slip in material that he should have disclosed long before, bit by bit.  And we have kept insisting here that the Prosecution has the obligation to disclose to the Defence all the material -- all evidentiary material that he intends to use in his case.  And, as Mr. Robinson has said, in failing to disclose the material, it is obvious that Mr. Robinson hasn't had the possibility of properly preparing this witness.  

Now -- and this is a problem that will keep recurring with the other witnesses that will take the stand.  And that is the reason wherefore we need a definitive and very clear solution if we intend to preserve the integrity of these proceedings.  Thank you.
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, on behalf of Mr. Ngirumpatse, I concur with the motion since it fortifies (inaudible) that my learned friend, Mr. Webster, began his cross-examination this morning, none of the documents or exhibits that he has used, apart from transcripts, have all been documents that he has produced by ambush.  

It is obvious, therefore, that as things stand, if we start hearing this witness with documents that we only discover as his cross-examination unfolds, the Defence will feel trapped or ambushed.  He should have disclosed those documents for us, especially as the first document that he produced today is a document that he says he's had for three or four months.  And I think he has had enough time to avail us of that document.  

And if we continue as things stand, if we continue hearing this witness as things stand, as my learned friend Robinson has pointed out, what therefore would be the need to do re-examination on documents that you might have decided not to admit -- as documents that we will admit into evidence in this trial?  I think it would be advisable; it would be wiser to find a solution now.  And if our learned friend, Mr. Webster, has any such documents he should disclose them to us as soon as practicable in order to avoid a situation like this one.  

Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, these applications actually take me a bit by surprise, because I thought we had passed the point where everything is turned into a disclosure issue.  We are in the Defence case.  The Prosecution has the legitimate right to explore witness credibility by placing documents before the witness and introducing a bit of surprise.  The entire witness's -- the entirety of the witness's testimony is not supposed to be rehearsed.  

Now, Mr. Robinson had previously made a motion of this Chamber for all potential Prosecution exhibits to be disclosed.  And this Chamber denied that motion.  And I believe in its decision it made the same observation that I've just made.  I'm not quite certain; I don't have it in front of me.  Quite frankly, I didn't expect these types of applications today.  

These are not disclosure issues.  And to slow down the progress of this trial with repeated complaints about disclosure when they are non-issues, I think, is unfortunate.  But I would like to continue.  We will be addressing these issues in writing and I would suspect that they would be quickly resolved once the submissions are tendered.  But this is not the type of issue that should slow this trial down.  In fact, this is probably the only trial in the Tribunal that is slowed down for reasons that are so -- but, you know, it is simply not germane to the trial process.  This is not a disclosure issue.  This is simply Defence attempts to slow the process down and to encumber it.  So, that is my submission. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, Mr. Webster could have avoided these issues by being fair in his disclosure practices.  So, we're not asking for something we're not entitled to.  If we were entitled to it under the rules, then there has been a violation.  If we're not entitled to it then there has been no violation.  Although one would think after all this time and trouble we've had with disclosure that Mr. Webster would have erred on the side of caution.  
But in any event, what you're being asked to do now is to impose some kind of remedy that would not prejudice the fair trial rights of the Accused.  Mr. Webster proposes to go on and use these documents with this witness.  We say that that is not fair, that we should bring another witness and suspend this testimony until you've decided that there has been a disclosure violation.  I think you can see there is a prima facie case for violation of disclosure here.  

We're not simply making noise about something that has no merit whatsoever.  I realise you want to take time to consider it, but it's apparent from the nature of these documents that it's at least at the best a close question as to or whether or not the disclosure violations took place, and in those circumstances it's not fair to Mr. Nzirorera that you proceed to let him ambush our witness.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hometowu, how long has this cross-examination been in progress? 
MR. HOMETOWU:
It is two hours and 50 minutes so far.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, what is your anticipated duration of this cross-examination. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I think it would require me to go over into tomorrow, perhaps right before the 
mid-morning break.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So how much additional time do you say you need, another two hours?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Approximately.  I just put that figure in.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Approximately.  I had anticipated a six-hour cross-examination.  I don't want to exhaust six hours, but I'd like to work within the parameters of six hours.  I think if I was given until tomorrow, after the mid-morning break, I should complete.  That's my expectation.  But things have been going much slower than I anticipated.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And, Mr. President, if I can pipe in here that I agree that Mr. Webster should have the time.  In spite of these disclosure violations, I think he's doing a good job on his cross-examination and the material was relevant and that he deserves the time.  He has not wasted the time.  But I still think that this 
witness's testimony should be suspended because of the disclosure violations.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, that answered a question that was on my mind as well for you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Perhaps I should interrupt Your Honour and thank Mr. Robinson for his kind remarks before the Chamber continues, following the Court's good example on instructions made previously. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, Mr. Webster.  

If we were to invite oral submissions on the matter, could you be ready by tomorrow morning? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster? 
MR. WEBSTER:
It's the Defence motion.  If he is ready, so are we.  But it would be more efficient to know his arguments before we are required to respond on the spot.  Perhaps he could outline them or find some way of communicating his -- the nature of his objection to us so that I too could be prepared.  He has to point out where these Rule 66(B) requests were made and how they were justified.  I can't really respond to that on my feet.  I mean, if we were going to do impromptu oral submissions, now would be the best time because we're both in the same position.  But if he makes an oral submission tomorrow morning, I need to prepare for it if he's going to substantiate it...(Microphones overlapping)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's move forward.  What is that you're requesting.  You are asking that he give you an advance notice of the arguments -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And how much time do you need for that. 
MR. WEBSTER:
If he gives me the advance notice this evening then I will prepare overnight and we can argue it tomorrow.  Or we can do it tomorrow -- if he gives me that information in the morning, then we can do it the following day.
THE PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
We will try to do it this evening, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  So we make a tentative schedule for oral submissions tomorrow morning.  We don't want to interrupt the testimony at this stage.  But we think that we should expedite our ruling.  So we'll continue now and you will address us tomorrow morning.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I think we have already given the sitrep an IP number, if I am not mistaken, P. 45? 
MR. MJUI:
P. 46 (sic). 
BY MR. WEBSTER:  
Q.	With respect to the person you identified in P. 357, do you think that he had a better relationship with Joseph Nzirorera than you did; that he had more contact or more opportunity to interact with Joseph Nzirorera than you did? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness --
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry, the witness did not have -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:  
Q.	Let me repeat the question for you, Mr. Witness.  

	With respect to the person that you identified in P. 357, do you think that he had a closer relationship to Joseph Nzirorera than you did?  In other words, is it likely that he would have had more opportunity to interact with Mr. Nzirorera than you did? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  With respect to that witness, I can say, if we can refer to a form of relationship he had with Joseph Nzirorera, but as far as I'm concerned I'm stating the truth to the Chamber.  I know Nzirorera, but Nzirorera does not know me.  I know him, but he doesn't know me.  And I'm talking about Nzirorera.  
Q.	Well, thank you for that clarification, Mr. Witness.  But what I'm trying to understand from you, is whether you think the person in 357 knew Nzirorera better than you did? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I find it hard to answer your question.  You know, it isn't easy to know under what circumstances a given individual met another.  For the case in point, I am unable to state if that person knew Nzirorera very well.  In any event, whether he knew him better than I did.  Had I seen them discussing maybe I would be in a position to comment.  But I never had that chance, so I am in no position to answer the question. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  That's a perfectly legitimate and complete response.  I have no problem with that response.  Would you agree -- excuse me, withdrawn.  

When you told us on Thursday that you had not seen Joseph Nzirorera in Mukingo since you last saw him at an MRND meeting in Nkuli commune, sometime in mid-1992, is it your suggestion that Joseph Nzirorera did not come back to Mukingo after that last time that you saw him in 1992 or is it possible that he visited Mukingo commune regularly, but that you didn't know about it? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  That is what I said, indeed.  But, that was with respect to the way the question was put to me.  I saw him between 1991 and 1992.  And I saw him only -- I saw him again only today in the Chamber.  But you remember that I was asked if he used to come to hold meetings, organise any other form of activity, and I did not see him within that framework.  That is what I stated to the Court -- to the Chamber.  
Q.	But you can accept that other people may have seen him coming back to Busogo secteur quite regularly during 1993 and 1994? 
A.	I never heard anything of the sort.  No one told me that at any point in time.  But, if he wants to assist the Chamber, he can say so.  He can state if he went to that place at that time.  But as far as I am concerned, I did not see him there. 
Q.	Well, if Mr. Nzirorera did come back to Busogo secteur regularly in 1993 and 1994, is that the type of information that you would have been aware of?  Did you have the type of circulation in Busogo secteur that would permit you to be aware of Nzirorera's presence, if he did indeed come back regularly in 1993 and 1994? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  When I cast my mind back to the circumstances under which he used to come to that place, I could have been informed with respect to the ministry that he was in charge of.  People used to come and meet him and seek employment.  He was a well-respected person, and very much liked by the people, especially as whenever a figure of authority visited a given place, a locality, the people were informed.  I'm not saying that all the people were informed, but a vast majority of the people were informed of the visit of such a figure of authority. 
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, would you suggest that if Joseph Nzirorera had been returning to Busogo secteur regularly, in 1993 and 1994, this is the type of thing that you would have been aware of? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I already answered your question.  I was not responsible for monitoring Nzirorera's movements in order to know if he had visited that area or not.  But close people could have been informed.  People who were close to Busogo would therefore have learnt that Nzirorera had visited that area. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, let me tell you what the person identified in P. 357 said on the 10th of April 2008, page 33 in the English text and page 41 in the French text.  

The witness is asked:  "Now, during the period before the death of the president how frequently did you see Mr. Nzirorera returning to Mukingo commune?"

The answer of the witness is:  "He used to come there to visit his family.  He used to come to his residence, but I cannot tell you the number of times I saw him, but he came there often.  I cannot tell you the number of times when he came there, but I know he came there to Mukindo commune regularly."  

And there's a follow up question:  "And did the frequency with which he came to the Mukingo commune diminish after the attack of the RPF in 1990?"  

The answer:  "I did not notice any difference."

So according to this witness, Joseph Nzirorera returned to Mukingo commune often and regularly.  Do you have any reason to dispute that information? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  The Prosecution is trying to establish a relationship between the witness's testimony and my testimony to him.  If that other witness used to see Nzirorera frequently, it is not my case.  I've already told the Chamber about the period during which I saw him, and I had other things to do to -- for my survival.  And I would not have stayed away from my activities to monitor 
	Nzirorera's movements.  If that witness has a special reason to see Nzirorera, that is his business.
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  We will move on to something else.  

Now, before you testified before another ICTR Trial Chamber for the first time, which was back in November 2002, you had already made a number of statements to the Rwandan prosecutor general about your case; isn't that so? 
A.	That is so. 
Q.	In fact, you had already confessed your own guilt, you'd already made several confessions in your own file; isn't that also the case? 
A.	That is exact.  
Q.	But going back to your testimony on Thursday of last week, you told us that at some point you were pressured to make false accusations and false confessions; right? 
A.	Right. 
Q.	Can you give us some idea of when the pressure on you personally started?  Give us some idea of when it was that the authorities started to force you to give false evidence? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Firstly, there is the first statement I made when I had just been arrested.  At the time, we were subjected to beatings and our statements were not read over to us.  And this carried on until 2002, when there was a campaign that was conducted to convince detainees to confess and enter guilty pleas.  And at the time, they had us believe that it was in the interests of the detainee to seek such a procedure. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, you told us last week that you were arrested in *******************.  And my question to you is:  How soon after your arrest were you forced to give false evidence? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  As I have already explained previously, it was particularly in 2002 that I was compelled to provide false statements.  But in the meantime, while we were interviewed by the public prosecution office -- by officials of the public prosecution's office, who did not hesitate to use violence on us, and after our statements, we didn't have a chance to read over what statements we had made.  But in 2002, the campaign to convince detainees to confess and enter guilty pleas was intensified and we had a template that we could use for our confessions to be accepted. 
Q.	So, is it your evidence, Mr. Witness, that you did not start to incorporate false information in your statements until 2002?  Is that your evidence? 
A.	Yes.  In my confessions which I started in 1998, I said the truth.  I can't say as much with respect to statements that were taken by the office of the public prosecution office.  But with respect to confessions that I made personally, this was the truth.  And I would like to specify that my first confession was 6th September 1998, while the second one was 15th December 1998. 
Q.	What about your statements in 1999?  Those statements were not forced by the authorities were they?  In other words, you did not give false information that you were pressured to give by the authorities when you made statements in 1999? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  As I've already stated previously, with respect to the confessions that I wrote myself, those were in line with the truth.  But I further stated that before the office of the public prosecution our statements were made under conditions that did not allow us to state the truth, as our statements were not even read over to us.  

The next statement was the one in 2002, during which there was a campaign for detainees to confess and enter the guilty plea was intensified. 
Q.	What about in the year 2000?  When you think back to the statements that you made in the year 2000, did any of those statements include information that was deliberately false? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  With respect to those statements made in 2000, do -- I no longer remember the exact contents.  They were made within the framework of the process of confession and guilty pleas.  And if you were to take those, the recorded statements before the office of the public prosecution, I would like to tell you that I do not recognise the contents of those because our interviews were somehow done under pressure and we were told the items that had to appear in our confessions for these to be acceptable. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, in a few minutes we're going to go over your statements one by one.  But before we actually look at the documents, I'm trying to get a sense from you as to what time it was that you actually started to include false information that you were pressured to include by the prison authorities.  So that's why I'm asking you all these questions.  And I'm giving you a full opportunity to explain to the Chamber which statements -- at which point in time the Rwandan authorities started to force you or coerce to include inaccurate information in your statements? 
(Pages 31 to 42 Eleanor Bastian)



1150H
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I'm unable to give you a specific date when I started to make 
false statements, but at the beginning of this process, before the office of the public prosecution, we used to deny our participation in crimes.  But a campaign was launched and informed us to speak the truth, and I remember that at the time I gave a statement before an assistant prosecutor known as 
Bayisabe (phonetic).  And in 2002, we realised that what the 
prosecutor -- office of the public prosecution was proposing to us was impossible.  

As a matter of fact, we had been told that had we even committed murders, we were going to gain some advantages and be subsequently released.  At the beginning, we hesitated, but as the pressure became more intense, we felt that what the office of the public prosecution was telling us was possible and that we could be released even if we had committed murders or participated in other crimes. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Witness, but with respect to the process that you've just finished describing, that's in relation to your statements of 2002.  Am I correct?
A.	Yes.  Those are my statements made in 2002. 
Q.	But the confessions that you made of your own activity, which were part of your file in 1998, in 1999, and in 2000, those statements were made by you and you alone.  They weren't the result of pressure from the authorities.

Are we agreed on that?  
A.	Yes.  Those confessions were made free of any pressure. 
Q.	Were you aware of any other prisoners that were coerced by authorities into providing false information before 2002?  Please focus on the time.  That's my concern.  I know that you state that others were coerced.  But I'm trying to understand your awareness of the coercion.  Was it only after 2002 that you became aware of that?
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. Nimy put the same question to me, and I applied for the Chamber to revert to closed session so that I could cite the names of the people who had convened us.  And in the same regard, I would answer today that there were many other detainees who were coerced into making false statements.   
Q.	I'm not asking you to give me their names now.  I'm asking you -- when you became aware of it for the first time, was it in 2002? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Some of the detainees were called and asked to make false statements before 2002, and that continued even beyond 2002.  And if the Chamber so allows -- so desires, it may carry out investigations of the detainees, and it would conclude there were detainees who left the prison after 6 p.m. and who returned at night; whereas, the rules at the time stated that no detainee was allowed to leave the prison after 6 p.m. 
Q.	When did you first become aware of other prisoners being pressured to give false evidence?  Give us a time of when you first became aware of that. 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I think I realised between 1999 and 2000, and that continued right up to 2005 and so forth and so forth. 
Q.	But you, yourself, did not succumb to the authorities until 2002.  That's your evidence? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Even though I can't remember all the contents of my testimonies, because I have given many statements, I would say that basically I gave the main information in 2000.  But I started giving testimonies or statements well before because prisoners were being asked to go -- to have recourse for the confessions and guilty plea for their statements to be accepted, admitted. 
Q.	Witness, I'm going to ask you a different -- we'll go on to something else.  There was a time that the prisoners from Busogo secteur came together informally in the prison and conducted their own 
	Gacaca proceeding.  Isn't that so?   
A.	Yes.  That happened. 
Q.	And that was before there was any formal Gacaca legislation.  Isn't that so?
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  The Prosecutor has said so himself.  People who hailed from Busogo came together within the framework of a Gacaca session.  Well, the Gacaca had already started operating in prisons.  So the Gacaca trials actually started in prisons. 
Q.	Yes, but my -- what I'm suggesting to you, Mr. Witness, was that when you got together in the prison and did your own informal Gacaca, that was not a part of the formal judicial legislation that introduced Gacaca in 2001.  Would you agree with me on that?
A.	Yes.  I agree with you on that point. 
Q.	So the Gacaca that you had in Ruhengeri prison in which the prisoners themselves got together -- this was not something that the authorities got together and directed or controlled, was it? 
A.	I thank you, Mr. President.  As an officer of the court, you are informed about the legislations governing prisons.  No prisoner can leave the prison premises without having been duly authorised by an official.  That wasn't possible. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, my question to you is quite simple.  In the prison -- not outside the prison.  In the prison itself on the prison grounds, there was a Gacaca process that you engaged in and the other prisoners from Mukingo commune and Busogo secteur engaged in sometime before 2001.  And you basically organised it on your own.  Would you agree with me on that?  If you don't agree, just say so, and we can move on.  But that's the information I'm trying to get from you.   
A.	I didn't understand the question, Mr. President.  In any case, that question is similar to the one that I thought I understood.  Concerning the rules governing prisons, nothing can be done inside the prisons without the officials of the prison having been informed about it.  Any activity undertaken within the prisons had to be known to the prison and the section authorities themselves.   

MR. WEBSTER: 
If Mr. Issa could give the witness the item in tab B.  There is a French text, an English text, and a  Kinyarwanda text.  

If you could hand the witness the handwritten Kinyarwanda text, and the rest of us could look at the French and English translations.  The Kinyarwanda is the last item, the handwritten Kinyarwanda text.  

The parties and the Chamber should be familiar with this document.  It's identified as D. NZ136.  It's already in evidence under seal only to protect the identity of one particular person.  

I just want to clarify for the record that the document that was included in our bundle that the witness has in front of him contains numbering on the left-hand side that I put in.  So it's not reflected in the scanned text that we have from CMS.  

And I've done that so we can follow it in English, French and Kinyarwanda.  The French text was already numbered.  The English text was not.  The copying on the Kinyarwanda text was faulty.  So in order for us to follow more carefully, I put the same numbers along the side.  So I just want to clarify that for everyone's benefit.   
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you've seen this document before, haven't you? 
A.	Yes.  I am quite familiar with that document. 
Q.	In fact, this document was actually authored -- or transcribed, not authored -- by the person that you've identified in P. 357.  Isn't that so? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  There are two parts to this document.  There's a first and a second part. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, this document is a cover letter dated the 22nd of November 1999 followed by a document which is entitled "Gacaca Court Sessions on the Crime of Genocide as Committed at Busogo, 
	Mukingo Commune 1990 to 1994".

Addressing ourselves not to the cover letter but to the document itself, wouldn't you agree that this is a document that the person that we've listed at P. 356 wrote on behalf of everybody else?  
A.	I thank you, Mr. President.  The Prosecutor says we're going to focus on the letter, but I do not agree with the contents of this report.  I am saying that all of this was done outside of prison, and the prison authorities were informed about it.  I realise that the letter is dated 22nd November 1999.
Q.	And I've asked you the same question three times, and you've avoided giving me an answer, Mr. Witness.  Wasn't the person listed in 357 the one that wrote the document on behalf of everyone else?  Can you just answer that question so that we can move on to the next thing.  If you disagree, say, "No, he was not the one."  If you don't know, say, "I don't know."  And if you agree with me, say, "Yes."  
A.	I thank you, Mr. President.  Yes, that is the person who drafted this report and this table.  But the letter was not written by that person.  It is true that he is the person who drew up the report and the table that is appended to it. 
Q.	What was so difficult about that?  Let's look at the document now.  Would you agree with me that the prison authorities did not tell you what to say in this document?
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I believe I have already answered that question.  I said that that Gacaca session took place in prison.  The legislation governing the recourse to confessions and the guilty plea was already in place.

Consequently, we came together and explained the circumstances in which the crime of genocide was perpetrated.  However, the authorities asked us to give such information following instructions that were given to us. 
Q.	When you testified before another Trial Chamber back on the 19th of November 2002, you told that Trial Chamber that you participated in a Gacaca proceeding in prison, and you mentioned that there were 47 participants.  We're talking about the same procedure now, aren't we, what you talked about back on the 19th of November 2002 and the document we're looking at now pertained to the same informal Gacaca proceeding?  Can we agree on that?   
A.	Yes.  That is true.  This is the Gacaca trial that I talked about in this Trial Chamber. 
Q.	But when you testified back in November of 2002, you did not have a copy of this document, or not in the courtroom anyway.  Would you agree? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Indeed this document was not shown to me, but I will talk about this letter as the Prosecutor desires.  We were all present, and we gave detailed information concerning the circumstances under which the crimes were committed.  

You'll find this in this document.  You'll see the various statements given by various persons.  Each and everyone gave information concerning the attacks that were launched and the attacks that they witnessed.

All this information was consolidated and put in one single document and sent to the 
public prosecution department, but this does not mean that each and everyone can rely on that information.  We're talking about 47 persons that were held responsible for the crimes that were committed at Busogo.  The Prosecutor is relying on this letter.

You will find in this document the detailed statements or what each person said in detail.  But you will not find the circumstances under which each and everyone committed the crimes there.  So this is a summary document, a brief summary, on the circumstances in which the crimes were committed in the locality, in a given locality. 
Q.	And when you testified back in November of 2002 you made no allegation that anything in this document had been coerced or was the result of pressure from the prison authorities on you or any of the prisoners.  Am I right? 
A.	I thank you, Mr. President.  I think that the Prosecutor doesn't have a portion of my statement.  I believe that in my testimony I said that the deputy prosecutor, Rukira wa Muhizi, came and told us that we had to have recourse to the confession and a guilty plea procedure.  By the way, he was informed that the people were going to go to Arusha.  I believe that I have given my own explanation insofar as those facts are concerned.   
Q.	All right.  Perhaps the best way to do this, Mr. Witness, is to actually look at what you said.  So I'll direct everyone to tab G in my bundle, excerpt number 5 from the (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover) trial.  And you can look at the last pages.  It's testimony on the 19th of November 2002.  It's page 73 in the English and page 134 in the French.

And, Mr. Witness, you were trying to explain to the Trial Chamber why (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover) was innocent of the crimes that he was charged with.  And your answer -- you were asked, "Why do you believe that (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover) is innocent of the crimes charged against him?" 

And your answer was, "I stated to the Tribunal that (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover) is innocent in respect of the charges against him because in prison, as we are at the prison where I am, we are 47 people.  At a Gacaca session in prison, none of the people that I mentioned ever mentioned him, ever cited him.  It is a Gacaca session that is recognised by the Rwandan prosecutor's office."

So based on that portion of your response, Mr. Witness, my understanding is that you were of the view that (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover) was not guilty of any crimes because he was never mentioned in that Gacaca document from the 22nd of November 1999.  Can we agree on that?
A.	If my recollection is not failing me, while I gave testimony or during the Gacaca session in prison, 
	(By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover) name never came up -- or rather, his name came up.  Somebody pronounced that name, but I don't remember who it was.  But it wasn't everyone's impression that (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover) had any role whatsoever to play in those events.  

We had discussions on several occasions.  And during those discussions, it was being said that there were people about whom false testimonies had been given.  So if you look at that table, you'll see that there are individual testimonies.  And as far as I am concerned, I never said that I saw him participating in those acts in any way whatsoever. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, what you said was that he was never mentioned, and then you go on at the bottom of that same page to say, "Following that Gacaca session, people were exculpated by what the prisoners had said, and they were released and rehabilitated.  Along the same lines, I think (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover) is innocent because none of the people in the Gacaca session prosecuted at my side, as I was, said that (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover) had participated in the criminal acts perpetrated in the Busogo secteur."

So I'm just reminding you of your previous testimony because I want us to be clear that that 
Gacaca proceeding of November 1991 is not one where you suggest the authorities pressured you to give false information; right?  
A.	As you have just explained it, I believe we have dwelled quite a bit on that point.  In any case, the authorities were informed about all that we were doing there.  Any activity that was carried out within the prison yard had to be brought to the knowledge of the prison authorities so that they can make a report thereof. 
Q.	So let's look at some of the things that the prisoners say in that document, Mr. Witness.  We can start with -- if you'll just give me one moment, please.  Let's look at what's reported next to number 32, which is page 9 in the English, page 6 in the French, and page 6 in the Kinyarwanda text.

So if you can find in your document number 32.  You see your accusations against Rugumire; right?  Have you found it, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Yes, I have located the portion. 
Q.	And that's true, right, what you said about Rugumire?
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  As far as those allegations are concerned, I did not speak the truth as to what Rugumire did, and he explained things. 
Q.	So you're telling us that you lied back in November of 1999 when you gave this information? 
A.	I thank you, Mr. President.  We as persons that were seeking to gather information -- I had made that statement in respect of Rugumire because I had seen him somewhere.  Now I am saying that at some point in time I realised that there was a woman who was raped in some location.  And he, himself, confirmed this fact.

Since earlier than that, before Gacaca session, he said he's not the person who raped the woman, but, rather, it was his companion who did so.  Now, what I said concerning Rugumire, this is information that I had got from two persons.  But Rugumire clarified the situation regarding the circumstance in which the crime was committed. 
Q.	When you gave that information back in November of 1999, you believed that you were giving accurate information about what Rugumire did back on the 7th of April 1994.  Isn't that so?
A.	Yes.  That is correct. 
Q.	And based on your previous response, it seems that you were accusing him of rape back on the 7th of April 1994; right?  That you saw.
A.	Yes.  That's indeed what I was saying. 
Q.	And then we can look at 33 and 34, just on the following page, where you again are giving evidence about what the rest of your group was doing in April of 1994.  And you talk about an attack on Samvora's (phonetic) house.  That's information that you provided; right?
A.	Please may I have a minute, Mr. Prosecutor.  Yes, indeed.  That's information that I provided. 
Q.	And the prison authorities weren't forcing you to provide that information.  
A.	I thank you, Mr. President.  I believe I've said this several times.  I said that at the time no one went out -- no one went out of his cell.  We were given a document to fill, and we were asked to fill the forms in such a way that our confessions could be accepted.  I have said no document could leave the prisons without the prison authorities being informed of the contents of the document. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, the only thing I asked you was whether your information was coerced by the 
	prison authorities.  All you have to say is yes or no.
A.	No one brought any pressure to bear on me for me to provide that information.  I gave information of my own volition. 
Q.	And you didn't see anybody coerce any of the other prisoners, any of the other 46 that provided information in this document.  Isn't that so? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  That is what I have always stated with respect to the question.  Before that, people had been summoned by the office of the public prosecutor.  I am not aware of what they were told.  When we began to organise those Gacaca sessions, you saw some of the information provided by the prisoners.  It was not necessary for pressure to be palpable.  Pressure can be exerted on someone without the others being aware of it.  In any event, one could notice that some pieces of information were desired to be reflected in that form of report. 
Q.	All right.  Mr. Witness, let's look at number 37.  You should recognise the name at 37.  We're not going to say that name. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, is this a new area?  It's 12:30.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I wanted to finish completely with this document. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much time would you need?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Maybe another five minutes or so.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll give you another five minutes.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Thanks.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	I will say that in looking through the document, I think the entry for you is the longest in the whole document of the 47 persons who are listed here.  You can leaf through it and tell me if you disagree.  But look at everything that is being said about you.  And we don't have to read it all out loud now, but read it to yourself.  All of that is true; isn't it?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Some pieces of information are correct; some are incorrect. 
Q.	What's incorrect?  In fact, on the document you yourself say, "I acknowledge everything that was said except for one fact."  

What is the one fact that you do not acknowledge? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  The Prosecutor is asking me a question with respect to the sole item that I do not acknowledge in this document.  The fact is that in this document it is stated that I am the one who led the attacks during which people were killed.  And I denied this fact even before the Rwanda courts.  That is what I do not acknowledge to date.  But I need to also add that you have some other minor issues which I do not acknowledge.  For instance, it states here the name of the detainee and the name of the people providing the information.  And these people provide information in order to allow the Gacaca courts to have information based on which they are going to decide.  And you didn't have any cross-examinations during these Gacaca sessions.  The detainees were told that they would have the chance to justify themselves before the judges.  And as you may have noticed, each of those people who had provided information in this document were not cross-examined, were not contradicted, because the people who have been accused were never given a chance to defend themselves.  And people provided information which they had heard from other people.  So they were grounding themselves of hearsay and were adding that they -- expecting that the person accused was going to confirm or reject them.  
Q.	Yes, Mr. Witness.  You have a very sophisticated analysis of the deficiencies of the legal procedure, but what you said was that you acknowledge everything except for one fact.  And the one fact that you've explained to us now is that you deny being the leader of the attacks, but we'll get into that tomorrow.

But I'd like us to look at one other entry before we close today, and that's on page 17 of the English text.  And in the Kinyarwanda -- 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I apologise for interrupting my learned colleague.  He asked for five minutes.  We are in our sixth minute.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Can you give me 30 seconds more. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	It's page 15 in the Kinyarwanda text.  Mr. Witness, if you could turn to page 15, and reading from the English text, it says, "Accused living abroad".  So apparently the 47 people that participated in this procedure listed persons who could not be found in Ruhengeri at the time.  And you'll see halfway down that list there's the name (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover), Chief Warrant Officer Karorero (phonetic).  You keep going down, and you see Bikete, the brother of (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover).  And on the next page Setako, Esdras Baheza. At the very bottom, Lieutenant Mburuburengero.  

	But the name that interests me most is (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover).  So now that you can see the document that you didn't have back in November of 2002, wouldn't you agree that in 1999 you and your co-detainees in fact did list 
	(By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover) as among the participants of the crimes in 1994? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I already explained that.  I said that the document was a result of declaring statements made by several people but that it was expected that before the court each of the detainees who had taken part in this exercise was going to provide further details.  And that therefore means that what is stated in this document cannot be deemed as being 100 per cent correct.  And that is, indeed, why everybody who was providing information was expected to provide further details before the judges where the accused was expected to defend themselves.  This document was submitted to the office of the public prosecutor, who in turn sent it to the Gacaca courts, to use it as grounds or bases for Gacaca court sessions.  But it was expected that people who had been cited in it would have the chance to defend themselves.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I thank you, Your Honour.  I appreciate the indulgence of Mr. Ngirumpatse and his Defence team.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we have come to the end of our session for today.  I remind you, as I have done previously, that during this or any adjournment you're not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  We'll take the adjournment now until tomorrow morning. 
(Court adjourned at 1240H)
