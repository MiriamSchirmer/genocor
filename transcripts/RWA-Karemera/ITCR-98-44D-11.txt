MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session.  

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  Prosecutor, do you have a witness for this morning? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Good morning, Your Honours.  Yes, we do.  We have witness GBV for this morning.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You have Witness GBV; is that correct?
MR. WEBSTER:
oui.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  

Could you bring in the witness, please.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam president, before the witness is brought in may I be heard briefly? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, we are listening to you.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.  

First, I would like to introduce to the members of the Trial Chamber my co-counsel who has now joined us, Mbaye Dior Diagne, and she will be here for the remainder of this session; perhaps she will have a good influence on me.  

Secondly, I have two applications I would like to make this morning.  However, I note that
Mr. Karemera is not represented here this morning and I wonder if you -- if the Trial Chamber wishes to proceed in the absence of representation of a defendant.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you.  

Good morning, Mrs. Diagne.  You are welcome.  

As regards the Accused, Karemera, is he not represented?  Did the lead counsel not think of someone to represent his client this morning?  

It would appear that one of the legal assistants went to see Mr. Martel to find out what is happening.  Ah, well, there is Mr. Martel coming in.  

Yes, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Your Honour.  

I just have two applications I wish to make.  The first regards Witness GBG, and my application is to strike portions of his testimony yesterday relating to new elements which do not appear in his statement or in his testimony in the Kajelijeli trial.  Those new elements are: that in the speech that he claims to have heard by Mr. Nzirorera, he said yesterday that Mr. Nzirorera promised to provide weapons and transportation to the Interahamwe and that, in fact, he observed Mr. Nzirorera give a weapon to a man named Mutumbo, and he observed a  vehicle from the ministry of public works that was being in front of the Interahamwe office.  

Thirdly, all -- that Mr. Nzirorera was seen in the area of the ISAE compound, conferring with
Mr. Kajelijeli, whereupon Mr. Kajelijeli then forced out the refugees from the ISAE.  Now, none of these elements were in the statements, and the witness directly talked about the meeting in the statement.  And, in fact, he said that he never witnessed the Interahamwe receiving any weapons in his statement, and so these were all new elements that were presented by this witness during the witness's testimony on direct examination.  

I didn't object to these elements being introduced during the direct examination because at the time I thought that I would have a full and fair opportunity to raise those matters on cross-examination, including whether or not  -- including why these things were being added now and were not in the comprehensive statement given by the witness in 1998.  

And as you know, no time limitation was placed on me until after I began my cross-examination.  And so I'm asking that you either strike the testimony as to these new elements that were given by Witness GBG, or you allow this witness to be recalled at some time later so that I can cross-examine him on these new elements.  So that's my first application.  

With respect to my second application, it pertains to the next witness coming up, GBV, and I will note for the record that we do not -- that Rule 66(A)(ii)was not complied with, once again, with respect to this witness.  I did not receive his statement, GBV-2, until the 21st of October 2003.  I had received GBV-1 within the time of Rule 66(A)(ii).  

However, I also did not receive the closed session testimony of Witness GBV until the 3rd of November 2003, and so the Rule 66(A)(ii) was not complied with respect to this witness, and I would move that the testimony of the witness  be excluded or there be other sanctions imposed by the Court for the Prosecution's violation of Rule 66(A)(ii).  

Finally with respect to Witness GBV, I ask to be notified at this time whether or not there are any new elements to this witness's testimony that is not contained in his statement.  I would refer the Court to a decision in the Bagosora case on the 18th of November 2003, which dealt with the issue of new material being provided in addition to those which are provided -- contained in the statement.  

In the Bagosora case the Prosecution is making a practice of providing information to the Defence which are called will-say statements.  Sometimes they provide it very close to the time of the testimony of the witness, and the Defence complained that this was not adequate notice for it to be able to cross-examine these witnesses, and the Trial Chamber agreed.  And, in fact, with respect to Rule 89(C), the Trial Chamber says that "Evidence whose reliability cannot adequately be tested by the Defence cannot have probative value", and therefore would not be admissible under Rule 89(C) which provides, "That a Chamber may admit any relevant evidence which it deems to have probative value".  

Now, we've received no -- absolutely zero will-say statements from the Prosecutor.  You heard with respect to Witness GBG that Ms. Ofemeni had -- Ojemeni had visited this witness in advance of his testimony, and so she presumably knew of these new elements which she was introducing, and we received no notice of this.

And so, with respect to what had happened in the past, we would ask for a remedy which I have already discussed, and we ask for some measures in the future so that this does not happen again.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Mr. Robinson.  

Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution, do you want to respond to that?
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, I would, Your Honour.  

First of all, concerning Mr. Robinson's application on the disclosure elements, Mr. Robinson has had the statement -- or these statements of Witness G -- excuse me, let me -- in terms of the new elements that he claims were introduced by the Witness GBG, the position of the Prosecutor is that there are no new elements.  The witness is testifying or testified about the same transactions, the same events, the same dates that were reflected in his testimony before the Kajelijeli trial and in his witness statements.  

Now, the witness may have gone into more detail and may have mentioned details of those transactions that did not come out  in his previous testimony or in his witness statement, but those are certainly not new elements.  

I believe it's incorrect to state or to acquaint the additional details that came out yesterday with the will-say statements in the Bagosora trial.  The will-say statements go into completely new incidents that were not mentioned in a witness's prior testimony or witness statements.  

With respect to Witness GBG, we are talking about the same incidents, the same date, same transactions, same crimes.  And as we pose questions to the witness and perhaps more pointed questions, more information comes out.  These witnesses, and specifically GBG, do not simply provide a running account or a running narrative of what happened to them; they respond to questions.  And when we pose particular questions or pose questions in different ways, we get fundamentally the same account, but slightly more or less detailed -- more or less details of the same account.  

So, on that basis, I would oppose Mr. Robinson's application.  Furthermore, he had three hours to cross-examine this witness on these allegedly new incidents or new information or things that he had not encountered previously in the witness's prior testimony or witness statements.  He instead chose to spend over an hour questioning the witness about whether he lived in one secteur and the other, and the number of students at his school, and the number of students that attended the meeting that the witness referred to, which were all matters that were extraneous to the issues in his testimony.  He chose to do that.  That is certainly his choice, but the Prosecution should not be disadvantaged by his errors of judgment and how he conducted his cross-examination.  

My recollection of yesterday's testimony, and I think the record will bear me out, is that the Court asked him to finish up his cross-examination within a specific amount of time once it became apparent that we were wasting time on matters that were truly not relevant, that could have been left behind because questions were asked repeatedly, the same question over and over again.  So on that basis, I'm opposing the application and I'm requesting that this Court simply move ahead to the next witness and that none of the witness's testimony be stricken from the record.  

As to Mr. Robinson's -- of the disclosure -- what he identities as the disclosure violations with respect to Witness GBV, who is about to testify, the witness's prior testimony and his prior witness statements were disclosed  -- he has had them in his possession at least for 21 days prior to this witness's testimony today.  

He has indicated for the record his dissatisfaction with what he terms late disclosure.  The position of the Prosecutor is that the disclosure, however late it may be, was not prejudicial to the Defence.  He has had ample opportunity to conduct investigations of the witness.  He has had his identity.  His identity has been revealed to him for at least three or four weeks now.  All the investigations that need to be done, I would assume he has had the opportunity to conduct.  He's made his record and I suggest that we move on.  If it's an issue that the Appeal Chamber wants to revisit, we can do that after the judgment, but the purposes of moving ahead with this trial, I suggest that we simply call the next witness and proceed.  

In terms of providing notice of what Mr. Robinson may anticipate as new information based on my interviews with the witness, I expect testimony to come forth on the same subject matter that is contained in the previous statement in the Kajelijeli trial and in his previously recorded witness statements.  If new information does come forth during the course of my examination or in the 
cross-examination, then Mr. Robinson will simply have to explore that in his own cross-examination.  

I'm not aware of any new element that needs to be introduced to the parties at this time.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution.

The Trial Chamber has deliberated and is of the opinion that with regard to Witness GBG, whom we heard yesterday, the Defence did not raise any reservations regarding new facts.  The Defence had sufficient time to cross-examine the said witness, since the Prosecutor examined the witness for less than three hours and the Defence had more than three and a half hours to cross-examine the same witness.  

We are of the view that it is not necessary to exclude the evidence that was adduced yesterday, and that the Defence is at liberty, in a written brief, to raise matters which, in their opinion, arise.  

With regard to Witness GBV, who must appear this morning, there were informal meetings between the parties.  And the Defence, during the said meeting, stated that it had no problems cross-examining the witness because they had had sufficient time to carry out their investigations.  We note that the disclosures that had to be done 60 days  before the commencement of trial were done.  The Prosecutor admits that there was some slight delay with regard to non-redacted or unredacted statements which had to be disclosed, at least 21 days before the witness was called, but as I said earlier on, the Defence said that this did not disturb it and that they were in a position to 
cross-examine the witness.  And that is why we accepted that the witness appear this morning. 

With regard to the new matters which Defence talked about, we'll see to that.  When the Prosecutor examines the witness in chief, we will see whether new matters are raised, but as far as we are concerned, he has just told us that he will simply be exploring further some points which were already raised during prior statements given by the witness.  

We will therefore ask the witness -- rather, the Prosecutor, to call in the witness.  Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Your Honour.  

At this time the Prosecutor requests that Witness GBV be brought into the courtroom.
	(Witness ushered in)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Interpreters, can you see the witness?  The witness said he would not put on his headphones.  Now he has accepted to put on his headphones.  Is that all right? 
THE WITNESS:
	Yes, that's fine. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, good morning, Witness.
THE WITNESS:
	Good morning, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness testifying for the Prosecution, and you will be known under pseudonym GBV.  You will be examined in chief by the Prosecutor, cross-examined by the Defence, and the Judges may put some questions to you.  We invite you to listen to the questions that will be put to you and to answer them with concision.  

Before answering the questions, we request you to make a solemn declaration and you will be assisted to do so by the registrar. 
MR. JUMA:
Mr. Witness, could you please stand up, raise your right hand and repeat the following words after me.
	(Declaration made by Witness GBV in Kinyarwanda)

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  Thank you, registrar. 

Counsel for the Prosecution, you may start examination-in-chef.
MR. WEBSTER:
Could I ask the assistant to the registry stand by the witness with the document that I had handed up to him earlier, please.  If you could simply place that in front of the witness and point with your finger as I go through this document, please.
WITNESS GBV,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Good morning.
Q.	Witness, we are going to start with a procedure that's typical.  In front of you, you will find a document that has been previously labelled P10.  And on that document there are some writings, and on the right-hand side of that document you should see three or four different indications.  If you look at the right-hand side of that document -- do you recognise your name?
A.	Yes, I recognise my name.
Q.	There is a -- the year.  Is that the year of your birth?
A.	Yes, that is my date of birth.
Q.	And below the year of your birth there is the indication of a cellule, a secteur, commune and a préfecture.  Are those the cellule, secteur, commune and préfecture of your birth?
A.	Yes, those are my cellule, secteur, commune and préfecture of origin.
Q.	And, again, it's the cellule, secteur, commune and préfecture.  Are those indications of where you presently reside, please?
A.	Yes, that is where I presently reside.
Q.	It says dated in Arusha this 3rd of December 2003.  Would you agree?
A.	In what way, please?
MR. MARTEL:
I would like to interrupt the Prosecutor.  Mention was made of the 3rd of December in French, I don't see information any where.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
There is a problem regarding the date which is not mentioned on the document.  The date is the 3rd of December.

MR. WEBSTER:
What is the problem?  I'm not sure I understand the objection.
THE WITNESS: 
	Yes.  Indeed, I have seen the date, I made a mistake, excuse me.
MR. WEBSTER:
Is there a problem?
THE WITNESS: 
	There is no problem.
MR. WEBSTER:
I was trying to make sure I understood, but --
MR. MARTEL:
What I see on my document is July 2000.
MR. WEBSTER:
(Overlapping microphones) -- an exhibit that was handed to the witness.  At the bottom of that exhibit it says, "Dated in Arusha, the 3rd December 2003".  I asked the witness if he agrees with me that the last indication on this document says "Dated in Arusha, the 3rd of December", that was my question to the witness.
MR. MARTEL:
We do not have that document.
MR. WEBSTER:
You do not have it because it is before the witness.  After he shall have recognised the document, you will receive it. 
MR. MARTEL:
Is it normal that we should -- is it normal that documents should be given to the witness and not to us?
MR. WEBSTER:
It is an exhibit and it will be presented to you after we presented it to the Judges.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Martel, you will have a copy of this document but before this document is tendered in evidence as an exhibit, it is normal that the witness should recognise the document before it is presented to you.  You shall have it as soon as it's presented to the witness.
MR. MARTEL:
I totally agree with you, Madam President, but the Prosecutor is supposed to disclose to us, prior to the hearing, all documents he intends to use during the testimony of a witness.  He is under a duty to provide us with that document beforehand so that we may consider it  -- review it.  It's not a rule of courtesy, but it is a rule of the Chamber.
MR. WEBSTER:
Counsel, you were here yesterday, it's the same thing we did yesterday.  First of all the witness's particulars have to be ascertained.  And if we are dealing with such a document, we have not -- the way you are starting is not proper.
MR. MARTEL:
But we should have that document before the hearing.  I've --
MR. WEBSTER:
I crave your indulgence, it is the Chamber that rules on this, not the Defence counsel.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, we shall follow the procedure I have indicated.  

Please proceed.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness --
MR. ROACH:
May I address the Court.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	(Not interpreted)
MR. ROACH:
Yes.  Madam President, as a matter of practice, I would like to implore this Court to adopt the procedure that if any document is to be placed before a witness, that Defence counsel, prior to the document being placed before the witness, have an opportunity to examine that document.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, the details on that document, are they the same as those you disclosed to the Defence?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Please, Prosecutor, speak into your microphone, please.
MR. WEBSTER:
It is the same information on the witness statement:  The name of the witness, his date of birth, place of birth, and his current residence.  These are all details that the Defence received.  It's a typical procedure that is used for identification of the witness.  So if the Defence wants to have that information, I do not object to them having it, but I believe it is a very simple procedure which allows us to very quickly identify the witness in a confidential manner before we proceed.  

So, I would ask the registrar to take the document, show it to the Bench, after which he will present it to the Defence, if this will expedite the proceedings. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Prosecutor, you may proceed.  We will show the document to the Defence now.  

Very well.  We will show that document to the Defence.  You will find that it's the same information, the same particulars on this document, same as those you received. 
MR. MARTEL:
The presentation is completely different.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is different, indeed, but the information is the same. 
MR. MARTEL:
	We would like to have a copy of this document. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You will have a copy of this document when it shall be admitted as an exhibit, but this is the usual procedure.
MR. MARTEL:
Madam president, the usual procedure is that whenever a party uses a document during the testimony of a witness, that document should first of all be provided to the other parties. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, then, that document has been provided to you, you've seen it and now we are proceeding.  

Counsel for the Prosecution, please proceed. 
MR. MARTEL:
Madam President, with your permission.  If this document contains the same information as that on the witness statement, why is the Prosecutor presenting it in a different manner? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is his right.  You cannot ask him to present the document the same way for you.  Look at the contents of the document, is it the same as the contents of the document you have?  Don't give lessons to the Prosecutor on how he should proceed.

Prosecutor, please proceed.
MR. WEBSTER:
(Microphone not activated) -- identify that -- the witness for the record.  I'm astounded that something so simple should take 15 minutes to resolve. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, I direct your attention -- would you look at this document again, please.  It's labelled P10.  We've already gone over all of the information concerning your identity and your current residence, today's date, and in the lower right-hand corner -- lower right-hand corner, would you agree that the indication GBV is inscribed in the lower right-hand corner?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Will you sign the document please.  Does he have a pen?
A.	Yes, I can do that and I have a pen.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could he indicate the date 
MR. WEBSTER:
The date is indicated on the sheet of paper.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I'd like to move this into evidence as People's Exhibit 10 (sic).
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, there is no objection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Counsel Robinson.

The document which is the witness's particulars of GBV will be admitted as Prosecution Exhibit PT 10.
	(Exhibit No. PT 10 admitted)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, please proceed.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Witness GBV, would you begin by telling us if you know Joseph Nzirorera.
A.	I know him.
Q.	What do you know about him?  Who is he and what does he do?
A.	I have known him since the period before 1981.  Subsequently, he was appointed minister of public works, energy and water.  And he later became a member of parliament in the CND, conseiller national de developpement and we are from the same commune.  Before it was known as Mukingo commune, but it is currently the district of Mutobo.
Q.	(Overlapping microphone)
A.	Ruhengeri préfecture.
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, have you ever had a face-to-face conversation with Mr. Nzirorera?
A.	No, I have never had a face-to-face conversion with him because he was an important personality.
Q.	(Overlapping microphone)
A.	I knew him for the first time during his electoral campaign for the legislative elections and I also saw him during MRND rallies.
Q.	When did this electoral campaign take place?  When was the first time that you started to know Joseph Nzirorera?
A.	It was after he became minister.  He came on his legislative campaign, but I do not recall the exact year, but what I know is that he was elected for two terms.
Q.	I'd like you to take a look around the courtroom today and tell us if you see Mr. Nzirorera anywhere in this courtroom.  You can stand up if you like.
A.	I don't need to stand up because I can see him.  He is sitting on that other side, on the second row.  I can see him from here.
Q.	(Overlapping microphones)
A.	He is wearing a dark coat, a white shirt and tie with colours.
Q.	Is he sitting -- (inaudible)
A.	To his right is -- to his left is a white person, and sitting left to him -- to his right is a lady.
MR. WEBSTER:
I would like the record to reflect that the witness has identified Mr. Nzirorera. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
May the record indicate that Witness GBV has recognised the Accused, Joseph Nzirorera, in this courtroom.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know to what political party Joseph Nzirorera belonged to?
A.	He was a member of the MRND party.
Q.	Directing our attention to 1994, do you know what office, if any, he held in the MRND at that time?
A.	He was the secretary general of the party.
Q.	Do you know if Mr. Nzirorera has a home in Ruhengeri?
A.	Yes.
Q.	How many, please?
A.	I would say that he had three houses -- three residences, and the fourth was that of his mother.
Q.	Can you tell us where they were specifically?
A.	The first house was in Ruhengeri town, the second was in the Byangabo trading centre which is his native village.  There was a commercial building there housing a pharmacy.  There was a third residence and that was where he stayed when he came from Kigali.  There was also his mother's house at the Byangabo centre.
Q.	The house where he stayed when he would come from Kigali, can you tell us what secteur that is in, please?
A.	In Busogo secteur.
Q.	Now, directing our attention to 1994, that is from January through the rest of the year of 1994, do you recall if Joseph Nzirorera came to Ruhengeri during that year?
A.	I recall that towards the end of the month of June, towards the end of the genocide, he came.
Q.	Where did you see him in June 1994?
A.	I saw him in Mutura commune in Gisenyi préfecture, in a place called Kabari.
Q.	We will come to that a little later on in your testimony, but for right now I'd like to concentrate on Ruhengeri.  

So if we direct our attention to the beginning of 1994, do you recall seeing Mr. Nzirorera in Ruhengeri in 1994?
A.	No, I didn't see him.
Q.	Directing our attention -- in 1993 --
A.	I saw him.
Q.	Can you tell us when and where you saw him in 1993?
A.	There was an MRND rally at the regional stadium.
Q.	(Overlapping microphones) -- in 1993?
A.	If I remember right, it was on two occasions. 
Q.	Let's direct our attention to the first time you saw him in 1993.  Can you explain to the Court the circumstances under which you saw him in 1993, that first time?
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Where did this meeting take place?
A.	All the population (incomprehensible).  The meeting was held at Ruhengeri national -- regional stadium.
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me.
MR. WEBSTER:
(Overlapping microphone) -- for Mr. Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President, I didn't receive the translation of the --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Not interpreted).
MR. ROBINSON:
I didn't receive the English translation  of the answer.  I think perhaps one problem is that Mr. Webster is not waiting long enough.  Maybe he is not listening in the English headphones, but frequently we are having the problem of Mr. Webster starting his question before the answer has been fully translated in English, so please be aware of that.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. Webster, can you hear the English booth?
MR. WEBSTER:
I have been listening to the French, so I will listen to neither.  

May I proceed? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Not interpreted)

MR. WEBSTER:
I will do that. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Okay, Mr. Witness, we are talking about the first time that you saw Mr. Nzirorera at a meeting in Ruhengeri at the stadium as you -- how did it come to pass that you yourself attended this meeting?
A.	It was compulsory.  The entire populace -- every member of the population had to attend that type of meeting.
Q.	(Overlapping microphone) -- obligatory.  Who was obliging you or forcing you to attend these meetings?
A.	When such a rally was held, MRND rally, in as much as all the members of the population of that area belonged to the MRND, from préfectural to cellule level, all members of the population were ordered to attend such meetings on the orders of the authorities.
Q.	How were you personally informed of this meeting?
A.	The responsable informed me of the meeting because I was a member of the cellule committee.
Q.	Was it unusual to be required to attend a meeting of this nature?
A.	No.  I could say, if you like, it was a law; whether you want to or not, you had to attend such rallies or you'd be jailed.
Q.	Would you know of examples of persons who were imprisoned because they did not attend meetings of this nature?
A.	I remember one case, Faustin Ntabwiko, N-T-A-B-W-I-K-O.
Q.	Referring to the meeting itself, was this a meeting only of the people of your commune?
A.	No, it was the entire préfecture.
Q.	Would you have any idea of how many people attended this meeting?
A.	They were very many.  I couldn't tell you exactly how many.
Q.	(Overlapping microphone) -- is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Was the stadium filled?
A.	Yes, the stadium was full. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I am pointing at that last interchange, Mr. Webster asked a question that we didn't hear and then the witness answered, "Yes", so I was unable to hear what the witness was answering yes to.  I'm sorry, but I think we are  -- Mr.  Webster needs to make a longer pause.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Mr. Webster, try and observe a pause otherwise we are going to lose a lot of time.
MR. WEBSTER:
I believe the last question that I asked was whether the stadium was filled on this occasion. 

THE WITNESS:
	Yes.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Can you tell us a bit about what transpired at this meeting?
A.	I remember Nzirorera's speech.  He was asking the population to be brave and to be firm in the struggle against the enemy, the Inyenzi-Inkotanyi, and to be faithful to the MRND party.
Q.	Would you tell us -- or would you explain to the Court what is meant by Inkotanyi-Inyenzi?
A.	Inkotanyi was a front of the refugees who had left the country in 1959 and wanted to return to the country by force, and they were named Inkotanyi.  But Inyenzi was a term invented in 1963 to denigrate such people.  In other words, Inyenzi means, in fact, cockroach.
Q.	Now, when you heard these terms being used at this meeting, what did you understand them to mean?
A.	In as much as the Inkotanyi were at the front in Birenga at the out set of the war, Tutsi were called Inyenzi and were said to be accomplices of those who had attacked.
Q.	So when you heard the words being used, "Inyenzi" and "Inkotanyi" by Mr. Nzirorera during that meeting, did you yourself understand him to be referring to the soldiers of the RPF or to all Tutsi?
A.	To my mind, he was referring to Tutsi in general.
Q.	And was there anything going on in Ruhengeri at the time, or had anything occurred in Ruhengeri at the time or leading up to that meeting that would lead you to that conclusion?
A.	After the 8th of March 1993, when the Inkotanyi launched an attack against Ruhengeri town, Tutsi who were not at the front and who were not Inkotanyi began to be targeted, to be killed.
Q.	And how does that impact upon your perception of what Mr. Nzirorera was saying at that time?  And we are talking about that first meeting in 1993 that you attended.
A.	I will give you an answer on that subject.  Inasmuch as this attack -- that attack had been launched against the town of Ruhengeri by the RPF Inyenzi-Inkotanyi, it was a question of sensitising the population in order that they take reprisals against the Tutsi population.

	1015H
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	Do you know of any reprisals that occurred, either prior to that meeting or after that meeting?
A.	After the meeting nothing happened.  However, before the meeting, and just after the attack of 
8th March, there were reprisals.
Q.	Tell us a bit about these reprisals.  What exactly happened to the extent that you were aware of these reprisals?
A.	Tutsi were -- more than eight of them were locked up in a building and killed.  Others saw their houses destroyed and some sought refuge in the Institute of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry.  Others sought refuge in Munyamvano's compound because his houses had not been destroyed.
Q.	Now, tell us where in Ruhengeri this was occurring, can you give us the name of the commune where these incidents that you have just described took place?
A.	Mukingo commune.
MR. ROBINSON: 
	Madam President, I would like to make an objection to these questions and the grounds of my objection is that it's not clear whether this witness is relying on his own first hand information or simply relating information provided to him by maybe others, second or third or fourth hand.  So I object until a proper foundation is laid for this testimony. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
MR. WEBSTER:
If I may proceed, I will clarify this area for the Defence. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:  
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you talk about these reprisals in Mukingo, did you observe these attacks, and did  know - - are you personally acquainted, did you know anyone that was attacked?
A.	They destroyed the house of Mr. -- a certain Sebikenyeri.  Rudatinya's family and neighbours went to the ISEA. Subikenyeri also sought refuge at Munyavano after their houses had been destroyed and also Kudatigerwa.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could you please spell these names? 
THE FRENCH INTERPRETER:
Rudatinya, R-U-D-A-T-I-N-Y-A, Sebikenyeri, S-E-B-I-K-E-N-Y-E-R-I, Nkubihinda, 
	N-K-U-B-I-H-I-N-D-A, Rudakorerwa, R-U-D-A-K-O-R-E-R-W-A. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, the information that you have just provided apart these families, is this a result of your own observations or is this something that others have told you?
A.	I witnessed what I have just told you.
Q.	Let's return to the meeting in Ruhengeri.  Do you recall anything else that Joseph Nzirorera said during that meeting, the first meeting?
MR. ROBINSON: 
	Excuse me, Madam President.  May I object this time and ask that --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Robinson?  What is your objection? 
MR. ROBINSON:
My objection is that the testimony about the house - - houses being destroyed and that he personally witnessed this is a new element that is not obtained in his statements, and therefore, an example of  something to which we do not have notice and it should be stricken.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours the onus is on - - I am asking this witness about the - -.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
MR. WEBSTER:
I am asking this witness about the attacks in 1993 in order to develop his testimony about the meeting that he attended in Ruhengeri in 1993.  His statements or his testimony about Nzirorera's discourse during that meeting we only have meaning for this Court if he could place it in context.  Now it's impossible to document every singe detail and nuance in the witness's testimony and serve that on the Defence.  But the essential element that I am trying to pursue here is the meeting in Ruhengeri, and  Mr. Nzirorera's statements during that meeting, will only have meaning if we place them in context with events that immediately preceded or followed that meeting and that is the reason I go into this area.
MR. ROBINSON: 
	Madam President, if I could respond briefly.  If Mr. Webster wishes to go into an area such as this, which is clearly new material.  It is his obligation to advise the Defence in advance to give us proper notice.  He has met with this witness prior to his testimony and this is not a surprise to him.  And if he wants to develop the testimony in this manner, he should have given us notice so that we could be prepared.  So I persist in my objection.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have noted when the witness mentioned Rudatinya, spoke of Rudatinya already in his statements.  So we will allow Counsel for the prosecution to pursue this line of questioning and we will see later what probative value to ascribe to what has been heard.  

Pray, proceed, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
	Microphone please.
MR. WEBSTER: 
	I am believe my last question was - - 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Microphone. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	I believe my last was: Did Mr. Nzirorera say anything in the course of this first meeting in 1993, the first meeting that you attended in 1993?
A.	Not as far as I know.  His speech lasted more than twenty minutes. 
Q.	Did the speech start with his discussion of the Inkontanyi or did that come in the middle of his speech?
A.	In the middle of his speech.  Normally, we begin by singing the praises of the party.  This was at the time of certain competition between the various political parties in the country it was customary to begin that way.
Q.	Well, tell us a bit about what was - - what happened, how did the singing and praises of the party happen?  Describe it to the Court for us, please.
A.	The idea was to tell people that the population of the northern region should remain faithful to the MRND party, that opposition parties that were established in the south should not come and recruit  members in the north,.
Q.	Did you see Joseph Nzirorera single out any party by name any other party by name?
A.	No.  He was talking in general terms, speaking of other parties that existed in the country.
Q.	Do you know a party that is identified by the initials CDR, that is - -
A.	Yes.  I know the party.
Q.	What do you know about that party?
A.	I know that it was a satellite party of MRND.
Q.	Did that party, the CDR, have any Hutu members, as far as you know?
A.	There were only Hutu.
Q.	And would you be able to describe the ideology of that party?
MR. ROBINSON: 
	Objection, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Robinson?
MR. ROBINSON:
My objection is that an inadequate foundation has been laid for this witness to either have knowledge of or to be qualified to answer that question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution.

MR. WEBSTER:
I have a few questions to put to provide additional, but there is nothing improper about the question but additional elements will come up in subsequent questions to this witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, you said that you had, that you have questions that will elucidate the issue, namely, clarify the first question that you put to the witness in respect of the CDR party.
MR. WEBSTER: 
	Yes, I will.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So, pray proceed, Counsel. 
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	Do you know if the CDR party was operating in Mukingo commune?
A.	Yes, the party was operating in Mukingo commune, and its members, most of its members were young people who were often described as young varied people.
Q.	Young, I am, sorry, I didn't get the last portion of the translation.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
People who were often described as young varied people, the young and varied.  Valiant we are sorry. 
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	Were you personally acquainted with is anyone was a member of the CDR?
A.	I remember its chairman, who was a young brother of Nzirorera.  He was called Silas Ntamakemwa, N-T-A-M-A-K-E-M-W-A.
Q.	And can you tell us anything about what Mr. Silas Ntemakemwa expressed about the political situation in Rwanda at that time, based on your observations of him and the things that he would say? Can you tell us what the ideology of the CDR was?
MR. ROBINSON: 
	Madam President, I would like to object to that question.  First of all, it's compound and secondly it is,  I think you must express to the witness whether he did in fact have conversations with Ntamakemwa before he can relate the substance of what may have learnt. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
My question - -
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	- - of Mr. Silas Ntamakemwa, or anything which Mr. Ntemakemwa may have said.  On the basis of that was he able to glean or comment on the ideology of the CDR.  If the witness can answer that question that should resolve the issue?
A.	As regards that man, his activities were hardly different from those of the Interahamwe or those of the other leaders of the Interahamwe.  In fact, he was one of the young leaders who had to steer the leadership of the party.  
Now as to what the ideology of the party was, I do not know it because I was not a member of that party.
Q.	Returning to Mr. Nzirorera's statements at the meeting at Ruhengeri in 1993, did you ever hear Joseph Nzirorera say anything about the CDR?
A.	No.  I do not remember anything along those lines.
Q.	Putting aside the question of that meeting, the first meeting at Ruhengeri, did you ever hear 
Mr. Nzirorera comment on the CDR at any other time?
A.	I did not hear anyone say that but I saw members of the CDR, who were called Mupamugabe and the Interahamwe together in the ISIMBI Bar at Byangabo.  In fact the bar belonged to Ntamakemwa. Otherwise, I do not know whether he made any comment on that.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Let's go back to this meeting in 1993 in Ruhengeri.  Was there any discussion of the other opposition parties, was there any discussion of the CDR at that meeting?
A.	I told you that as far as I can remember there was nothing said about the CDR party.
Q.	You mentioned earlier the Interahamwe, can you clarify that for the Court, please?  What are the Interahamwe?
A.	The Interahamwe were the young members of the MRND party.  In fact, I would say that they were the armed wing of the MRND party.
Q.	Do you know when the Interahamwe were formed?
A.	I think it was around 1993.
Q.	Do you recall seeing the Interahamwe at this meeting in Ruhengeri in 1993?
A.	There were many people at the meeting, I was not able to see them.
Q.	Well, ordinarily, how would you recognise members of the Interahamwe?  Is there anything distinctive about them that would bring them to your attention?
A.	The Interahamwe had a uniform which was their distinguishing mark.
Q.	Would you describe this uniform to us, please?
A.	The uniform was sewn from the kitenge fabric.
Q.	Could you tell us what the colours of the fabric were?
A.	The colours were green, yellow and a whitish colour.
Q.	Now, when you were speaking about this meeting in Ruhengeri before you mentioned a portion of the meeting there were praises sung to the MRND party?
A.	The song was entirely sung and which was translated as follows: "We have single objective we Rwandans, peace, unity and development".  I do not know whether you want me to give you the content of the song, the meaning of the song.
Q.	We would like to know, however, when these songs were being sung, were persons dressed in those Interahamwe uniform participating in the presentation?
A.	In fact, it was those who wore the Interahamwe uniform who tuned or who sang the songs and we, or rather they tuned the song and we the members of the population would sing with them.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I am going to ask the technician to bring up an image on the screen and I would like you to take a look at this image and tell me if it resembles, in any manner, the persons that were singing these songs in Ruhengeri in 1993?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, there seems to be problems.  We cannot see the images. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
It's coming up.
THE WITNESS: 
	Yes, that is the image.  The people you see on the scene are Interahamwe. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Those uniforms, are those uniforms that you mentioned earlier the material you mentioned earlier?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	Can you think back to this meeting in 1993 in Ruhengeri, approximately, how many people would dress like that and singing like that during the course of that meeting?
A.	They were many.  I cannot give you the exact number.  There were Interahamwe in each commune and in the said meeting, were all the members of the population where all the inhabitants of Ruhengeri were.  I would like to remind you that Ruhengeri préfecture had 16 communes.  So you would understand that they were many.
Q.	Mr. Witness, is the image that we just saw an accurate representation of what these Interahamwe looked like when they were chanting and singing in Ruhengeri at that meeting in 1993?
A.	Yes, that is an accurate representation of what the Interahamwe were at that time.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I would like to have that video clip, identified for the Court as Prosecution 11 and I would like to move it into evidence at this time.
MR. ROBINSON: 
	Madam President, I have an objection to this exhibit, and my objection relates to the disclosure which is a problem you will hear about many times from me most likely.  The -- an image was, I believe, given - - this image, perhaps was contained on a CD that was given to us yesterday afternoon by the court management services.  I haven't had a chance to look into the CD, but it also contains other images, and I don't know whether the image that we see here is the entirety of the meeting or whatever event it was that this image was captured at.  I take it that this was not the meeting that the witness was referring to but some other meeting. And I have requested from Mr. Webster, not solely to receive any single image that the Prosecution selects for use in Court. They haven't taped an MRND meeting.  They should perhaps disclose well in advance of this trial, that entire tape to us.  So because of the untimely disclosure of both these images and lack of disclosure of the rest of what has been filmed, we object to the admission of the evidence at this time and request that the admission be deferred until such time as we will be able to have proper disclosure.
MR. MARTEL: 
	Madam President, may I address the Court? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Martel, proceed. 
MR. MARTEL:
I can easily imagine that this video clip also contains sound.  It should at least have some sound but we did not hear any sound.  We did not hear any sound, we did not hear any sound from the clip that we have been shown.  So I would like to know what these people were saying.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
	We thank you, Counsel.  

Prosecutor?
MR. WEBSTER: 
	First of all, let me begin, before I respond to Mr. Robinson.  Let me comply with Mr. Martel's request and have the video clip played with the sound.  Initially, I had directed that the sound not be included, but let's have the sound now, please.  

Excuse me, I think we have a technical problem with the booth.  We do have the sound here, I am not sure the technicians at the back can help us by putting a switch in the back.  It was not my intention to play the sound.  I was more concerned with simply the visual images of the uniforms but, in compliance and in response to Mr. Martel, I would be happy to play the tape with the sound, if that can be arranged.  I think they are working on it now.  (Microphone not activated) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We're now not hearing the Prosecution, Madam.
MR. WEBSTER: 
	Perhaps while they continue to work with the technical aspect, so that I can respond to Mr -- we will have to depend on the translation booth to give us the translation.  I have been told what it means, but I prefer the translation for that comes from the, - - from the  interpreters. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
	The Presiding Judge's microphone, please.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I wanted to know whether the Kinyarwandan interpreters can translate to us this clip. 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:  
	Madam President, it is necessary for us to take down the words that are being sung so that we should be in a position to interpret.  Otherwise, given the speed of the delivery, I am afraid we may not be able to properly translate the words that are being sounded.
MR. MARTEL: 
	Madam President, my client has told me that people were singing the following words:  We are together in the context of the multi-party politics. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Defence counsel, please hold on. 
MR. MARTEL:
I have not finished.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
	Counsel, please hold on.  It is for the interpreters to tell us what is meant, what these people we have just seen are singing in the clip.  We cannot ask an Accused or the Prosecutor to tell us what is being sung.  In fact the Prosecutor has told that he has the translation, but we cannot rely on the Prosecutor's translation.  
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Madam President, it is necessary for the film to be shown slowly so that we should be able to translate, otherwise we will not be able to translate the words  that are being sung.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
	Can you show the clip more slowly so as to enable the Kinyarwanda booth to translate?  Technician, can you show them more slowly, please? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I think we would be able to play the tape repeatedly but I don't think we would be able to slow it down.  May I propose that I respond to Mr. Robinson and that during the break, we can play the tape for the Kinyarwanda translators and perhaps after he break this afternoon, or visual image essentially or later on this morning they can tell us exactly what is being said.  The clip is being offered for clip. And,  we can provide the text of what is being said later on this morning if we -- would be able to address, Mr. Robinson this time? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber is of the view that the parties could meet during the break and view the tape together in the presence of the interpreters who will give us the translation of what is being sung.  

Counsel for the Prosecution, you may continue.
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you.  Mr. Robinson raised an objection on the basis of disclosure.  I would like to point out at this time that the tape is not being offered for disclosure.  The tape falls under the regime of Rule 66(B,) which is inspection. We did attempt tor offer inspection for a number of items to the Defence attorneys we were to work that out individually over the course of the last several weeks.  We have done that on a piecemeal basis.  This tape was, or this clip was included in longer portions of a number of video clips that we will be using during the course of the trial.  

As Mr. Robinson stated copies were provided to the Defence just to ensure that they had a basis to look at these images before they were shown in Court today, but the do not fall within the purview of Rule 66(A).  These are materials that can be made available for inspection.  We will make them available for inspection if the copies that were served yesterday are not sufficient, but they certainly do not fall within Rule 66(A) which the disclosure provision.

I also add that this material was available in the public domain from the documentary, that has been distributed commercially and it is being offered in evidence not because it supports the CDR purportsto be this meeting from 1993, but simply for the image of the Interahamwe in their uniforms and foundation was laid to introduce it through this witness because he has recognised those uniforms and recognised the method of chanting.  So it is offered in evidence on that basis and it falls within Rule 66(B) not Rule 66(A).
MR. ROBINSON: 
	Madam President, if I can respond very briefly. I agree with Mr. Webster that this falls within 
Rule 66(B) -- and I had asked to have the right in advance of the trial to inspect all items and materials of the Defence which I had given him a long list, which includes videos of MRND meetings or any kind documents relating to MRND meetings, and none of that was provided to me.  

Yes, Yesterday, I did receive a CD that I don't doubt contains this image.  But I didn't have time to look at it because the disclosure was so late and also I had no notice that any of this would be used with this particular witness.  

And so it is not fair to give something to the night before that is going to be offered as an exhibit and expect us, without letting us it is going to be offered the next day and expect us to be prepared.  This should have been given in advance of the trial.

I also note that you ordered the Prosecutor to give us the list of exhibits that he is going to use before the trial started and this was not on the list of exhibits that were given by the Prosecutor.  And under the Rule, I believe it is 73 bis pertaining to pre-trial proceedings, the Prosecutor is required to give a list of all exhibits in advance of the trial and to provide copies of all those exhibits to us in advance of the trial and we don't have that.  So, while it may be very well, that this is an exhibit that should be admitted at some point during the course of this trial, I ask that it not be admitted until we have had proper time to review the disclosure we have been given and I would ask the P\prosecutor to be ordered at this time now to disclose to us all of these types of exhibits that in their entirety he intends to use them in the course of this trial.  Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER: 
I think we are still a bit - -.  Thank you.
MR. MARTEL: 
Madam President, may I address the Court?  My legal assistant has told me that we indeed received this CD belatedly.  We were therefore not able to view it because it contains severe dozens of facts or materials and we do not know which materials the Prosecutor wants to use now.  
So I am supporting the application made by my colleague, Mr. Robinson.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Prosecutor do you want to respond again or you to limit yourself to what you said - - to what you said earlier on?
MR. WEBSTER: 
	I'd like to make a few more comments.  First, it places us at a disadvantage when Mr. Robinson continuously refers to disclosure not complying to disclosure when in fact the operative word term should be inspection, because that is where there is a bit of confusion, And the confusion, I think, is being introduced deliberately.  We have no obligation to disclose this material.  This does not fall under the regime of disclosure which is contained in Rule 66(A).  This is an item that should offered for inspection.  As a matter of fact, with respect to this particular clip, it not come to my possession and we had not intended to move forward with it until sometime last week and, in fact, we want great pains to locate at it and that was only done last week by taking a particular portion from a tape that is publically available and, in fact, it was taken from an exhibit in a previous trial that is a part of the public domain now.

So that is the context for what may be termed late inspection when requests have been made in the past for inspection.  We have done everything within our means to afford all of the Defence Counsel enough opportunity to see and look at exhibits that we intend to use during the trial.  We are under no obligation to make copies of these materials and disclose copies prior to them being used.
All these materials are exhibits, they are not -- these are not prior statement of witnesses, the do not fall within the regime of disclosure.  

And tend my submission on that note, the Defence have copies of the materials now.  We provide copies as a courtesy, they can come to our office and come to look at additional materials which may be brought forth in the course of the trial, but there is no obligation on the part of the Prosecutor to make copies and disclose these materials to Defence.  They are offered for inspection.  And when it is offered the Defence can cross-examine witnesses on these items.  We can re-visit, you know, they can bring the items back up in other testimonies from witnesses in question, the accuracy of the image so on and so forth, but there is no legal impediment, and my submission is that there is there is no legal impediment for offering them into evidence at this time.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
A short a while ago we said that this clip or tape may be viewed by the parties concerned and after that we could consider its admission as a Prosecution exhibit.  

Can you view the clip during the break that is going to follow shortly, because we have come for the time for the mid-morning break of 11:00 is now so if you can view the tape during the short break so that we can be provided with the translation, then we can resume on this matter after the short break.  
MR. MARTEL: 
	Madam President, this tape contains several elements it may take several hours to view the tape.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
	But we are talking about the piece of clip that was viewed, that was projected before the Chamber.  The rest of the tape maybe viewed later on because it does not directly concern this witness.  The  Prosecutor clearly said earlier on that what he is interested in is just what he just showed us namely the uniform of the Interahamwe and the sound.  So you will limit yourself to that and after that we can continue with the rest of the tape.  

Could we ask the Prosecutor where exactly we could find this clip so that we should not be compelled to go through the whole tape.  This exercise will take place in the presence of the Prosecutor and the interpreters.  Therefore, we will only have to follow what is being done will together.
MR. MARTEL: 
	Very well. Thank you, Madam President.
MR. WEBSTER:
B is concerned with 13 seconds, the 13 seconds, of the clip, it is not necessarily to refer to any other documents, they are simply images that were taken out of a longer sequence. Thirteen seconds, it shouldn't take more than ten minutes to go over it.  So I don't see it as an issue.  We can do that within th fifteen minutes allotted for the break.  I think we will come back, will have a translation and then we can move forwards.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We will now take the mid-morning break and we resume after fifteen minutes after you must have viewed the cassette.

Thank you the proceedings stand adjourned.
	(Court adjourned at 1100H)
(Pages 16 to 26 by Petrus Chijarira)



      (Court resumed at 1151H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber is back in session. 

At 3 p.m., judgement will be rendered in the Media case, and Counsel Martel notably wishes to be present at that hearing, so we propose the following:  Let us continue until 2 p.m., if we have not finished with this witness, and then we shall resume at 1600 hours, so the pause -- the break will be from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. 

Counsel for the Prosecution, that is not a problem? 
MR. MARTEL:
Thank you, Madam President. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel for the Prosecution said something.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Your Honour.  During the break we were able to -- I was able to meet with the Kinyarwanda translator.  We do have an official translation into French of the 13-second portion of that video clip.  I did provide the Defence with a copy with the exact -- with the same copy we are offering into evidence.  I believe they did conduct an inspection of that CD-ROM.  In addition, they have all been served with copies of the extended clip, so the inspection itself is definitely completed with respect to this 13-second clip, and the translation should be available to the Court from the interpretation booth. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. ROBINSON:
Before you make your decision with respect to the admission of this exhibit, I would like to first of all say yes, we have now reviewed the 11-second clip, so yes.  However, we have -- we do not know the context in which this -- we only have 11 seconds disclosed to us of what may very well have been an important MRND meeting, or, for all we know, may have been a tape made by the RPF.  So we don't have the context of this.  I wish to point out that in a motion that I filed in September of 2002, I asked for all recordings, minutes or news media reports of all MRND party meetings during the period 1992 through 1994. 

And in my second motion for inspection or disclosure of items material to the Defence, I asked for all minutes or recordings of MRND national meetings or rallies held between 1 November 1992 and 6 April 1994.  These are clearly items which we've said, for over a year now, are material to our Defence and should have been provided to us in advance of trial. 

Now, to manipulate an 11-second clip out of documents, which were -- we've asked for, for over a year, and expect to bring this into evidence at this stage, I believe, is -- deprives Mr. Nzirorera of his right to a fair trial. 

Secondly, I would point out that the Trial Chamber -- first, I would ask for an order from the Trial Chamber that we be allowed to inspect the full contents of any clips, tapes or electronic media of any kind that the Prosecution has in its possession relating to MRND meetings or rallies. 

The second issue I think the Trial Chamber has to decide -- and I think it's a decision that's overdue -- is:  Is the Prosecutor required to give us copies of their exhibits in advance of trial?  You see this inspection procedure is a waste of time.  If we have copies of their exhibits before the trial, we would never have had to go through all of this.  

I thought this matter was settled at the meeting of November 3rd, in which I raised this exact point, and it was my item 31 in the letter of 3 November that I provided to Mr. O'Donnell, and my understanding was that the government -- or the Prosecution had agreed to provide copies of their exhibits, although I have to say that at the time we were only speaking of documentary exhibits; I didn't make the distinction about videotape exhibits.  But if you look at the minutes of that meeting, you'll see that there was an understanding that the Prosecution would undertake to provide to the Defence copies of all those items that it intended to use at the trial, and that has not been done. 

So to avoid the kind of delay and problems we've had today, I would ask you to make two orders:  first, that we be given inspection of all MRND meeting materials from beginning to end, in whatever format they exist; and, second, that all Prosecution -- copies of all Prosecution exhibits be furnished to the Defence by the end of this week.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, Your Honour.  I oppose the Defence application, Your Honour.  First of all, it's impracticable for us to make copies of all these materials.  It is not required under the Statute or the Rules.  These materials are available for inspection.  Inspection can be arranged in our office or in our evidence unit.  We have no opposition whatsoever to arranging inspection for the Defence. 
As a courtesy, and to expedite matters, copies of this video clip were made available to the Defence.  These materials were deposited with CMS yesterday morning, or the day before; I think it was either yesterday morning or late on Monday afternoon.  The Defence has copies.  And we've satisfied our obligations. 

There is no legal impediment to going forward at this stage.  When I introduced the exhibit, I stated quite explicitly that it was being introduced as a visual aid.  We were not concerned with the content of what was being said in the video clip.  The sound was brought in at Mr. Martel's request, and now we have a translation for the clip.  But essentially, the purpose of offering the clip was to afford the witness an opportunity to identify the uniforms that he had previously described.  There is absolutely no prejudice to the Defence.  If the Defence wants to cross-examine the witness on his description of the uniforms and his appreciation for what he had identified as the uniforms in that image, they can do so.  The only purpose of the video clip is to assist the witness in explaining to the Court what these uniforms looked like.  It's not a violation of disclosure.  We've afforded inspection, and I think that's where the issue begins and ends. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, if I could just respond briefly, Mr. Webster has not afforded us inspection of these items, and he opposed both of these motions on the grounds that it was not material to the Defence to see what is said at MRND rallies and meetings.  And his position has been consistently that they oppose inspection or disclosure of these materials.  So if there has been a change in that position, we are hearing about that for the first time today, and we have not had the opportunity to inspect any of the materials that I've been requesting since 2002. 
MR. MARTEL:
Madam President, with your permission? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, but very briefly, please, Counsel. 
MR. MARTEL:
We are told that there is a translation of what the Interahamwe sing on the cassette.  Could we have that translation, please?  
MR. O'SHEA:
Madam President? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel? 
MR. O'SHEA:
I have nothing specifically to say about this particular video clipping.  However, a motion has just been made by Mr. Robinson for an order in relation to Prosecution exhibits generally.  That is a motion which I would support.  I would support it on the basis that it is a reasonable request that the Defence have the opportunity to see Prosecution exhibits well before a witness gives testimony.  I noted earlier that Mr. Webster attempted to make a distinction between inspection and disclosure.  I do not support that distinction.  Inspection is a form of disclosure.  The purpose of inspection is to allow the Defence proper facilities to prepare their Defence.  And I would refer Your Honours to the order in Kajelijeli in relation to a videotape, where it was held that while there was no general obligation to provide copies on the Prosecution, the Court would order disclosure of a copy of the videotape on the basis that it was the kind of material that the Defence needed time to look at properly, in their own time.  

It's not really, in my submission, a question of a technical interpretation of the Rules here.  This Court has a discretion to make an order where it facilitates the preparation of the Defence or the interests of justice.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, would you like to add something? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I would like this issue to be decided on an item-by-item basis.  We are dealing with an issue here where a copy was provided to the Defence.  So I don't think it would be in the best interests of administering this trial for this Trial Chamber to order the Prosecutor to make copies of every single exhibit that we intend to tender.  The exhibit that has given rise to this dispute was, in fact, copied and served on the Defence.  There is no need for an order to effect what has already taken place.  The Defence has copies, we have all looked at the videotape, inspection has been conducted, and I think that resolves -- or I would suggest, or submit, that that resolves the issue. 

In terms of the specific provision that requires inspection of this particular exhibit, it has nothing to do with what is material to the Defence.  We afford inspection because we, the Prosecution, move forward with it as an exhibit for trial. 

We responded to Mr. Robinson's motions.  We still oppose those motions.  Had he particularised and specified a particular tape, or of a particular meeting, then it would have fallen within the purview of Rule 66(B) as an item that is material to the Defence.  That is not what brings this issue before the Court.  This issue is before the Court because the people -- the Prosecutor moves forward with this as an exhibit for trial.  And we have afforded inspection, we have provided copies, and I think that submission should resolve this issue.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecutor. 

The Chamber has deliberated.  It overrules the two motions filed by Counsel Robinson, pointing out that Counsel Robinson had indeed filed a motion in the same matters regarding MRND documents, and we ruled on those motions, stating that it was too vast, that the request was too vast.  So our decision now regarding the exhibit is that both parties have been able to view the documents, inspect the documents, so we are of the opinion that it is not necessary to disclose such documents well beforehand to the parties.  Disclosure was done here.  The parties viewed the document.  

And so we admit it as Prosecution Exhibit P. 11.
(Exhibit No. P. 11 admitted)
MR. MARTEL:
Madam President, with your permission? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You have another motion, Counsel? 
MR. MARTEL:
My colleague says that there is a translation of what is said in that document.  I would like to obtain that translation, and I would like it to be provided with the document, because it is an integral part of that document.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, of course. 

Counsel for the Prosecution? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I met with the Kinyarwanda translator over the break.  He did make a French translation.  We can play that tape again and have the interpreters from the booth interpret.  I have transcribed what he translated, but would I prefer that it enter the record orally through the -- through the interpretation. 

If the Court requests me to file this, I will do so, but since it is an interpretation coming from, in fact, the registry, from the translation booth, I would prefer that he read it into the record as an interpretation, as opposed to me filing a document that I typed. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Just a minute, Counsel. 

Counsel for the Prosecution, could this take, at most, five minutes? 
MR. WEBSTER:
(Previous translation continued) ... tell us what is being said.  I have a transcription here in French, but this is not an official transcription.  This is what I wrote on my computer, as dictated by the interpreter.  I think it should come into the record through his interpretation.  I will do as the Court instructs.  If you would like me to file this, I will do that, but I'm simply clarifying that this is something that I generated, and not the interpreter, but he can speak what he heard, and we can play the tape again.  But I will do as the Court instructs me. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, then.  So we could view the cassette again.
MR. MARTEL:
Madam President, with your permission, I don't understand the distinction my learned friend is making between an informal translation and an official translation.  When the witness speaks in Kinyarwanda, it is the same interpreter speaking in French. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But now this will be before the Chamber, and we will have it directly on the transcripts.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, may I be heard on a motion? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I have not heard what you said, Counsel Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
May I be heard briefly on a motion that I have? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, very briefly, please. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I move for disclosure of the -- excuse me, Madam President.  I move for the disclosure of the entire tape from which this 11 seconds was made. 

Can you imagine if I brought you a document in which I had blocked out all but one line or one sentence and attempted to offer that as an exhibit in this Court without affording Mr. Webster the opportunity to see the entire document?  That's exactly what we have here.  I believe that under these circumstances, as opposed to this particular tape, we are entitled to it in its entirety, and I move for its disclosure at this time, and I move for an opportunity to view the tape in its entirety before having to question the witness about it.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
If I may just provide a point of clarification which may assist the Trial Chamber?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
MR. WEBSTER:
(Previous translation continued) ... was actually copied and provided to the Defence.  I think there are over ten minutes worth of video clips.  Those sequences on the CD-ROM that was disclosed - or, rather, copied and provided to the Defence -- puts all of these clips in context.  There are at least ten minutes worth of tape, even from the original videotape.  They are simply images that are spliced together.  He has the full panoply of images on the materials that were disclosed to him yesterday.  I'm talking about the Defence, and Mr. Robinson in particular. 

What we have in Prosecution No. 11 are 13 seconds where the Interahamwe uniforms appear, in this longer sequence of around 10 or 15 minutes.  There was never any concern on my part to look at the substance of what was being said.  It was simply the visual image, and I think I stated that when I introduced the exhibit.  So in terms of having a longer sequence of images from which these 11 second -- 13 seconds were taken, the Defence already has that in their possession. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I understand that --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Counsel Robinson, you are wasting the Court's time.  You have already put a question to us and we responded.  And you said you had received the video clips.  And we overrule your objection.  We are wasting a lot of time with all these irrelevant objections. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Actually, the Judge said "unjustified objections," not "irrelevant."  Thank you. 
(Videotape played)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"And you, MRND members, we have the -- we have the same plan, the Interahamwe of the movement." 

The interpreter observes that there is a break here, and the speech continues:  

"Of multiparty politics.  We are together.  We are together, within the multiparty politics, we are together.  We are together." 

The interpreter observes that the text stops here because of a break.
MR. WEBSTER:
Maybe we can ask the interpreters to deliver their interpretation. 
MR. MARTEL:
Madam President, my client states that the interpretation is completely false, that it is not good. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This is from our interpreters, and they have just interpreted what is on the video. 

Very well.  Can you proceed, please? 

MR. WEBSTER:
I didn't even hear the translation myself.  I was listening to the English.  Did it come through on the English? 
MR. O'SHEA:
I don't know if it came through, but I didn't hear it.
MR. WEBSTER:
I didn't hear anything.
MR. O'SHEA:
I can't say it's a technical problem.  It may just be that I was on the wrong channel.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The interpreters will give the translation again.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"And you, members of MRND, we are those who have the same plan.  We are the Interahamwe of the movement who love" inaudible "of multipartyism.  We are together.  We are together, within multipartyism, we are together, we are together," inaudible. 
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.  May I proceed? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
MR. MARTEL:
Madam President, the Prosecutor has taken one hour 20 minutes to provide exculpatory information.  "We are together in multipartyism." 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you could go back to those elements in cross-examination. 
MR. MARTEL:
I would like that, in future, my learned friend, who is always talking of courtesy, should change his methods.  He should stop playing a game of hide and seek.  For example, yesterday, on page 2 --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, please.  As I said earlier, you can go through these points in cross-examination.  Allow us to proceed.  You will have enough time to talk about all this. 
MR. MARTEL:
And the one hour 20 minutes of time wasted is attributed to my learned friend. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, you have the floor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you.

BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right, Mr. Witness, we are still on the issue of this first meeting that you attended in Ruhengeri in 1993.  Aside from Joseph Nzirorera, what other dignitaries were present? 
A.	Those I remember were the préfet of the préfecture, and others whose names I do not remember.
Q.	I'm sorry, I didn't get the translation.  Could I have the answer repeated?  I didn't get it on my --
A.	I recall that there was the préfet of the préfecture, who was, by the way, among the speakers at the meeting.  As for the others, I do not remember, because it happened a very long time ago.
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know Juvénal Kajelijeli?
A.	I know him.
Q.	Tell us who he was, please, and how you come to know him. 
A.	He was the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune, and subsequently I knew him in his capacity as head of Interahamwe.
Q.	Do you recall when he became the bourgmestre of Mukingo?
A.	He was appointed bourgmestre of Mukingo commune in 1989, and he held that post up to 1993. 
Q.	Can you tell us what the relationship was, if any, between Joseph Nzirorera and Juvénal Kajelijeli? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Objection, Madam President, lack of foundation. 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecutor? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I've asked the witness a simple question.  The witness can answer the question.  I don't -- there is no basis for the objection.  The witness can answer the question and explain the circumstances under which he knew Juvénal Kajelijeli and knew of the relationship between Juvénal Kajelijeli and Joseph Nzirorera.  I can ask ten questions to get at the same result.  I think if we want to proceed that I ask ten questions where one would do, I'll do that, but I'm trying to get through this testimony. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, may I respond? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, please answer the question. 
THE WITNESS:
I said that I knew Kajelijeli since the time when he was bourgmestre of my commune, and subsequently, I knew him in his capacity as head of the Interahamwe.  But I do not know the relationship between him and Kajelijeli.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  Did you ever see Juvénal Kajelijeli in the presence of Joseph Nzirorera?  Have you ever seen the two of them together? 
A.	I saw them together.
Q.	Under what circumstances would you see them together? 
A.	They were in Nzirorera's house, when they came to Mukingo commune from Kigali.  On another occasion, I was taking part in a meeting, and I saw Nzirorera meeting Juvénal Kajelijeli.
Q.	Was Juvénal Kajelijeli present at the meeting in Ruhengeri in 1993, the first meeting that you were referring to? 
A.	Yes.  Moreover, he attended the two meetings.
Q.	Witness, directing your attention to the second meeting that you referred to, can you tell us about this second meeting?  Do you recall when in 1993 it took place? 
A.	The meeting was held in 1993; however, I do not remember the month. 
Q.	But you discussed two meetings that took place in 1993.  We discussed the first one at length earlier this morning, and now I'm asking you to tell us about the second meeting.  Now, do you recall that second meeting? 
A.	No.  I remember neither the date nor the month --
Q.	But do you remember attending --
A.	-- when the meeting took place. 

Yes, I attended the meeting, of course.
Q.	Tell us what happened at that second meeting. 
A.	I do not remember exactly the words spoken or what was said during the second meeting, but as I stated, just like during the first meeting, during the second meeting the idea was to sensitise the local population to the need to fight against the enemy, namely, the Inkotanyi.
Q.	Did Mr. Nzirorera make an address during that second meeting?  Did he address the crowd? 
A.	I do not remember.
Q.	Do you remember if he said anything at all during that second meeting? 
A.	No, I do not remember.  All I remember is what he said during the first meeting.
Q.	For the second meeting, were you asked to attend in the same manner that you were asked to attend the first meeting?  How was it that this second meeting was brought to your attention? 
A.	Yes.  Whenever there was a MRND meeting, it was an order, and whoever did not attend the meeting was punished.
Q.	With respect to this second meeting, how many people were present?  Were there as many as present at the first meeting? 
A.	There were -- there were many, very many.
Q.	Was there animation at this second meeting at all?
A.	Any meeting which held, be it at the level of a préfecture, right down to the level of the cellule, there was always what is referred to as animation -- entertainment, so to speak.
Q.	And with respect to the animation at this second meeting in Ruhengeri, were there also Interahamwe present at this meeting? 
A.	Yes.  They were present.
Q.	Can you tell us how many -- how many of the Interahamwe that you recognised at this second meeting, please? 
A.	Since there was a huge crowd, it was not possible for me to recognise any of the Interahamwe.
Q.	Was Juvénal Kajelijeli present at this second meeting as well? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, directing our attention to the year 1993, you've told us about seeing Mr. Nzirorera twice at these two meetings in Ruhengeri.  Are there any other instances where you saw Mr. Nzirorera during 1993?
A.	I used to see him often, whenever he came to his native or his birth place; he would share a drink with the Interahamwe, for the purpose of congratulating them.
Q.	And how often would this occur in 1993?  Would you be able to tell us how many times a month you would see him, for example, if we directed our attention to the beginning of 1993?  If you can think back to the month of January and February, does any specific incident come to mind when you saw Mr. Nzirorera?
A.	I saw him after the month of March.  That is after the attack that was launched against the Ruhengeri town by the Inkotanyi.
Q.	Would you describe to us the circumstances under which you saw him?  What was he doing when you saw him? 
A.	I testified that he was always accompanied by the Interahamwe.  I used to see him at his residence as well as at the bar belonging to his younger brother at Byangabo.  That is where I often saw him.
Q.	Which residence are we talking about?  You had mentioned three residences previously.  Could you tell us which one you saw him in after March of 1993?   
A.	The first time I saw him, he was in his mother's house.  The second time he was at the bar in Byangabo.
Q.	When you saw him at the bar in Byangabo, did you recognise any of the people that were with him?
A.	I was able to recognise some Interahamwe whom I knew.  I was also able to recognise Kajelijeli.
Q.	Would you tell us some of the names of the Interahamwe that you saw with him at that time? 
A.	There were many.  I remember in particular Niyigaba, Michel; Alexi Rukundo; and Musafiri; Gakuru; as well as Gato.  There were twins.  One of the twins was called Abdulkarim and the other Saidi.  There was also Silas Burakari. 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
I will spell that.  I will spell Rukundo:  R-U-K-U-N-D-O.  Niyigaba:  N-I-Y-I-G-A-B-A.  
Musafiri:  M-U-S-A-F-I-R-I.  Gakuru:  G-A-K-U-R-U.  Gato:  G-A-T-O.  
Abdulkarim:  A-B-D-U-L-K-A-R-I-M.  Saidi:  S-A-I-D-I.  Burakari:  B-U-R-A-K-A-R-I.

BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  Directing your attention to the person you identified as Michel Niyigaba, did this person have any particular status among the Interahamwe? 
A.	He was an important Interahamwe, a very influential Interahamwe.
Q.	Mr. Witness, are you familiar with the Amahindure?
A.	Yes, I know him.
Q.	Is it a him?  My question was if you were familiar with the Amahindure, and I think the translation referred to a "him."  Is that what the witness said?
A.	Yes, I know them.
Q.	Can you explain to the Court what the Amahindure were?
A.	Amahindure was a group of vigorous young men who had been sufficiently trained and who had been taught to handle or operate weapons.  Of course, other people knew how to handle weapons, but these were very vigorous young people who were chosen from among the Interahamwe.
Q.	So how do you distinguish between the Amahindure and the Interahamwe?  What's the difference between those two groupings? 
A.	They are practically the same, except that the Amahindure had received advanced, very advanced, training.  It is the same thing as the paracommandos within the army who receive advanced training.  The Amahindure had also received advanced training, very advanced training.
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, you mentioned, and you identified for us, Interahamwe uniforms before.  Did these Amahindure use these same uniforms, or did they have any other distinctive form of dress? 
A.	They wore the same uniform.
Q.	And were you able to identify who the leaders of the Amahindure were in Mukingo?
A.	No.  Amahindure was a special group.
Q.	Well, you identified --
A.	There was a secret surrounding the group.
Q.	Among the names that you just mentioned to us, of which one was Michel Niyigaba, how many of the others were part of the Amahindure? 
A.	I cannot know their names because, between the area where I lived and the area where they lived, there was a significant distance.
Q.	All right.  Don't tell us where you live, but tell us where these men live. 
A.	The Amahindure lived in the Busogo secteur.
Q.	Now, you mentioned Rukundu, Alexi; you mentioned twins, Abdulkarim and Saidi; you mentioned Musafiri.  Are all these members of the Amahindure, as far as you know, or not? 
A.	With reference to their behaviour, since they were young people who behaved like the Amahindure, I would say that they were members of the group.
Q.	Did you ever see these men with Juvénal Kajelijeli?
A.	Yes.  I used to see them together often.
Q.	Where would you see them? 
A.	I saw them especially during events or when -- or, rather, during demonstrations or when roadblocks were set up.
Q.	Well, when you say "events," can you give us an example of some of the events that you have in mind? 
A.	For example, at some point in time, they demonstrated to protest against the Minister of Primary and Secondary Education of the time, namely Agathe Uwilingiyimana.  They could also demonstrate when there were agreements signed here in Arusha on the sharing of power; and during the signing of such agreements, they would demonstrate, go down the streets and harass vehicles.
Q.	And where would this take place? 
A.	The demonstrations took place on the Ruhengeri-Gisenyi road and also very near the higher institute of agriculture and animal husbandry, ISAE.
Q.	You mentioned seeing these men at roadblocks as well.  When was this? 
A.	The roadblocks were erected or set up in 1993.
Q.	And tell me where you saw these roadblocks, please. 
A.	There were many roadblocks erected on the Ruhengeri-Gisenyi road; in particular, very near our area, the area where we lived, and also in front of the ISAE.  Sometimes there were roadblocks erected in Byangabo.
Q.	But Mr. Witness, give us some idea of the time of these roadblocks.  Was this something that was done on a continuous basis, or did you see this only once in a while? 
A.	In 1993, the roadblocks were erected after the attack launched by the RPF Inkotanyi against the Ruhengeri town.  The idea was to intercept the Tutsi who were fleeing, because at that time the Tutsi were targeted.
Q.	And when you say the Tutsi were targeted, are you referring to Tutsi residents at Mukingo, or are you referring to RPF soldiers? 
A.	When the roadblocks were erected, it was said that the idea was to intercept RPF soldiers, but this was only a pretext, because RPF soldiers were at the war front.  Therefore, it was clear that those sought to be intercepted were members of the Tutsi population which was targeted.
Q.	Did you observe any incidents of violence at those roadblocks? 
A.	Since no Tutsi could go past the roadblocks, so there was no Tutsi who passed, because all the Tutsi from Bagogwe had been settled at that institute.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you had mentioned the MRND party in Mukingo.  Can you tell us who the leaders of the MRND party in Mukingo commune were in 1993? 
A.	It was Jean Damascéne Niyoyita, who, moreover was inspector of primary and secondary education.
Q.	Are you familiar with a Mr. Esdras Baheza? 
A.	I know him.
Q.	Tell us who he is and what his line of occupation was in 1993. 
A.	Esdras Baheza was an influential tradesman in that locality, and he was also the chairman of the association of traders.  He was highly loved by major politicians like Nzirorera.  Besides, he had been appointed leader of the Interahamwe.  I know him from that perspective.
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, did you ever see leaders of the Interahamwe in the same company or parting company with leaders of the MRND?  Did you ever see them together? 
A.	They had the same objective.  Thus, during meetings, they were always together, except during Interahamwe meetings.  Otherwise, on other occasions -- for example, during MRND meetings -- MRND leaders, as well as Interahamwe leaders, were always together.
Q.	Did you attend these meetings yourself? 
A.	I very often attended all meetings -- I attended -- I often attended MRND meetings.
Q.	And when you say the Interahamwe and the MRND leaders -- when you say -- excuse me.  When you say the Interahamwe and the MRND had the same objectives, can you explain yourself, please?  What do you mean by that? 
A.	I would say, for example, that the MRND was a political party that had its members in government, and the Interahamwe was an armed wing; in fact, it was a militia which acted on behalf of that party.  Therefore, they had the same objective.
Q.	I'd like to ask you about the government officials in Ruhengeri, and in particular in Mukingo commune.  Now, directing your attention to 1993, I believe you stated that Juvénal Kajelijeli was the bourgmestre.  Is that -- would you confirm that, please?  Or would you explain that? 
A.	At that time he was no longer bourgmestre.  He had been replaced by someone else, because other political parties had raised their voice to protest against the fact that Kajelijeli was bourgmestre even though he was a criminal, and those political parties wanted bourgmestres who were educated.
Q.	Well, directing our attention to the next administrative unit, which would be the level of the secteur, do you know who the conseillers de secteur were in Mukingo commune? 
A.	I do not know if you want to know the names of all the conseillers of the commune.  Perhaps you may further explain your question, or reword it, because I do not quite understand what you expect of me.
Q.	Maybe you could begin by telling us how many secteurs there were in Mukingo commune, if you can remember. 
A.	There were eight secteurs.
Q.	Okay.  With respect to these eight secteurs, would you know if each of those conseillers de secteur were members of the MRND or members of any other political party?
A.	If I refer to the situation which prevailed at the time, all these conseillers were members of the MRND, because whether you wanted or not, the inhabitants of our locality were members of the MRND party.
Q.	If you take the example of the conseiller in your secteur, did that conseiller have any role to play with the Interahamwe organisation? 
A.	As I stated a while ago, the Interahamwe had leaders at all levels, so all leaders in secteurs and cellules were members of MRND and, therefore, supported the Interahamwe.  However, in each locality, there was a leader of the Interahamwe group.
Q.	So, for example, did the conseiller de secteur in your area have control or give orders to the Interahamwe in your area? 
A.	The Interahamwe received orders from their own leaders, but when there were meetings, the conseillers could give general instructions, which the population -- instructions valid for the population as a whole.
Q.	All right.  Well, Mr. Witness, when you think of Mukingo commune, who would you identify as the leader of the Interahamwe in Mukingo? 
A.	Kajelijeli.
Q.	And who would you identify as the leader of the MRND at the level of Mukingo commune? 
A.	Niyoyita, Jean Damascéne; Jean Damascéne Niyoyita.
Q.	And if you had to compare Kajelijeli to Niyoyita, Jean Damascéne, which of those figures was more authoritative?  Who had more influence over whom? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Objection, Madam President.  This question lacks foundation.  We don't know how he would know this. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, my objection is that there is no foundation for this question.  You can't assess its probative value since we don't know how the witness would know this to compare. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I would submit that this is an area that Mr. Robinson can explore in cross-examination, if he wishes to.  I'd like to proceed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Counsel for the Prosecution.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, directing your attention to when you would observe Niyoyita, Jean Damascéne, and when you would observe Juvénal Kajelijeli, who you've both identified as authorities at the level of the commune in Mukingo, can you explain to us which one of those two individuals was more influential in Mukingo commune and why? 
A.	The more influential was Juvénal Kajelijeli.  In fact, it is as though he were -- he was the leader of both Nkuli and Mukingo communes.  His power came from higher authority, such as Nzirorera and the préfet.
(Pages 27 to 41 by Mark Porter) 



	1300H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Well, would you tell us the name of the préfet you are referring to, please?
A.	When he was bourgmestre the préfet was Zigiranyirazo Protais, but at the time of the events, the préfet was Charles Zambzeragasa.
Q.	And what is it that makes you think Zigiranyirazo or Joseph Nzirorera had anything to do with Kajelijeli's influence?  Tell us the basis of your making that statement.
A.	I say that because ever since he had become bourgmestre, it wasn't because he was the most intelligent or the strongest, he held his influence from all his superiors, and, moreover, he committed violations and went -- he was summoned to court.  The courts couldn't touch him, because he was favoured by the support of the authorities I mentioned.
Q.	You mentioned that at one point, when there were a number of political parties, during the period of multipartysm, that Kajelijeli was removed as bourgmestre.  Did his formal removal as bourgmestre make any difference, in terms of his real power in Mukingo commune, as far as you could tell?
A.	Nothing changed.  He stayed the same.  What changed was merely he wasn't sitting in the office as bourgmestre of the commune, but as to his power, nothing changed.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I would like to make an objection and move to strike the testimony with respective powers in the commune.  This witness is not an expert, yet he's giving his opinion on subjects that are appropriate for expert testimony.  I continually objected for a lack of foundation, and I move to strike all this testimony as lacking foundation and being the subject of opinion evidence, as opposed to fact evidence.  If he wants to tell us what he observed, yes, but what his opinion is, not permitted.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I'm going to go into these areas with the witness.  Mr. Robinson can explore all these issues on cross-examination.  I'm sure his glowing cross-examination will bring out all of the points that are needed to put this witness's observations in proper its perspective.  If I could proceed, I'm sure the record will be adequately developed.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I just --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Pray proceed, Counsel for the Prosecution.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, again directing your attention to 1993, you've just testified that even after Juvénal Kajelijeli was removed as bourgmestre, that he was still influential.  Can you please explain that a bit to us.  What types of things did he do and could he do in Mukingo commune that lead you to make that statement?
A.	At the time I could observe that when there was an MRND meeting, it was Kajelijeli who seemed to be the most influential of all participants.  Moreover, I participated in a meeting in Nkuli commune, a neighbouring commune, and Nzirorera sang Kajelijeli's praises, saying that if all bourgmestres worked as Kajelijeli did, the préfecture would progress.
Q.	Do you recall when this meeting took place, the meeting that you've just referred to?
A.	It was in 1993.  But I do not remember precisely which month, but I remember that it was after the month of March.
Q.	Aside from Nzirorera singing Kajelijeli's praises, was there anything else you were able to observe in the interaction between Joseph Nzirorera and Kajelijeli, which leads you to believe that Nzirorera favoured Kajelijeli's -- or supported Kajelijeli's leadership?
A.	As I said before, when he was a leader -- in fact, other people could have been appointed who had more education, but he had a reputation as a killer, since the Inkotanyi attack, and yet he was the one who was appointed to that position.
Q.	Aside from the meeting that you've just described in Nkuli, were there any other meetings where you saw Nzirorera and Kajelijeli at the same time?
A.	No other meeting.
Q.	Well, aside from meetings -- and this, again, is staying within 1993 -- when else did you see them together?
A.	I did not see them together on any other occasion in 1993.
Q.	Well, directing our attention only to Nzirorera at this point, were there other occasions that you saw Joseph Nzirorera in Mukingo in 1993?
A.	I saw him all the time, as I said before, when he bought beer for the Interahamwe or when he bought drinks for the population.  He was a rich man.  And when he came, everybody came to see him, and that was due to the fact that he was in the habit of buying drinks for members of the population, and it was the local inhabitants, and it was on those occasions that I saw him.
Q.	Remind us, if you saw this before, where did you see him buying these drinks?  Is there any specific location or locations where you saw this happen?
A.	At the Byangabo bar.
Q.	Do you know who that bar belonged to?
A.	That bar was run by Nzirorera's younger brother, Silas Ntamakemwa.
Q.	Correct me if I'm wrong, is this the bar in Byangabo business centre?  Remind me if that is your answer, please.
A.	No, it is not at Byangabo centre but near the Byangabo trading centre.  I would say that the bar is near the higher institute of agronomy and animal husbandry, but about 200 metres from Byangabo trading centre.
Q.	Aside from this bar, was there any other location where you would observe Joseph Nzirorera, and again, this is in 1993.
A.	I saw him at his mother's place at Byangabo and at his residence where he came to rest.
Q.	How often would you see him at his mother's place?
A.	I saw him on several occasions.  I can't tell you the number of times I saw him there.
Q.	On the occasions that you would see him at his mother's place, was he alone, or were there other people as well?
A.	He was with many people.  When he came, everybody came running, friends and even people who were not necessarily his friends.  Everybody came to greet him, and that was because it was his custom to buy them drinks.  There are people, also, who came to see him who, were trying to get work.
Q.	If we direct our attention to 1992, do you recall seeing Joseph Nzirorera in Mukingo in 1992?
A.	I don't remember, but when he came and I was at that trading centre, I would see him.  But I am not in a position to tell you that I saw him in the year that you mentioned specifically.
Q.	And 1991, if we directed our attention to 1991, would you be able to identify occasions when and if you saw him at that time?
A.	As I've just said, in respect of 1992, I must have seen him in 1991, but not in any specific occasion or any specific event that I could recall, that would come to mind.
Q.	Well, did the frequency that you would see Joseph Nzirorera increase over time?  So, for example, if we compare 1991 with 1993, did you see him more often at one time than the other?
A.	I saw him on several occasions in 1993 when the Interahamwe and MRND propaganda was being made in the context of multipartyism, but before then I saw him during legislative election campaigns because he was a candidate.
Q.	On the times that you would see him in 1993, did you ever see him address the Interahamwe as a group?
A.	At the time he was making his Interahamwe speeches, it was because they were in a secluded place at a bar or at his house, so that the curious onlookers could not hear what he was saying.
Q.	Well, when you mention curious onlookers, are you classing yourself among them?
A.	When you speak of a curious onlooker, it might be people invited to a public place where a meeting is being held, or people who try to get into somewhere where a private consultation is going on.  I don't know what you are referring exactly to so I could answer you.
Q.	Well, what I'm trying to get at, Mr. Witness, is your perceptions or your observations of Mr. Nzirorera.  It seems to me that you are saying that you were at a distance.  Is that accurate?  You were not in the meetings themselves that were held with the Interahamwe?
A.	That is correct, yes.
Q.	If I understand your testimony correctly -- and you correct me if I'm wrong -- you are saying that you observed him with the Interahamwe, but you did not hear what their conversation was.  Is that accurate?
A.	Yes, yes, that is correct.
Q.	Now, you mentioned that you were a member of the MRND.
A.	Yes.
Q.	And that was because the MRND was the predominant party in Mukingo.  I believe that was your testimony, is that correct?
A.	No, it's not, because it was the dominant party.  It's because everybody was compelled, obliged to be a member of the party, whether one wanted to or not.  For example, myself, even though I might have reservations, I was a member of the party.
Q.	And are we talking about the period after 1992 as well?  When you make that statement, are you referring to the period after 1992 as well?
A.	I don't understand correctly what you are referring to, between what I'm saying and the (unintelligible).  What exactly do you mean?
Q.	I'm trying to have you clarify your answer a bit.  You talked about being obligated to be a member of the MRND, and your previous testimony was that after the period of multipartyism, that not much changed in Mukingo.  So I'm coming back to that area, and I'm asking you, when you say that you were compelled to be a member of the MRND, are you also referring to the period after 1992?
A.	Yes, quite.
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, were you ever invited to be a member of the Interahamwe?
A.	No, I was never approached on that matter.
Q.	Well, to the extent that you know, how were individuals in your commune approached to become members of the Interahamwe?
A.	It was the responsable of the cellule who chose young men who were strong, and in good health, and those lists were sent up to the communal level.
Q.	Well, with respect to you -- and we're looking at the years 1992-1993 -- do you think the reason you were not chosen was because of your age?
A.	It's true that I was already quite old, but I don't think that was the reason why I wasn't selected.
Q.	Well, in your mind, what was the reason for not being selected?
A.	They were looking for a specific category of people, and there was another category of people they didn't want, and I was in the latter category.  I could, perhaps, give you a reason for that.
Q.	That's my next question, Mr. Witness.  Explain to the Court the distinctions that you are trying to make.
A.	Some people were suspects.  One wasn't sure of them.  One suspected them of being in the opposition.  Others, while, they weren't called Tutsi, they were Tutsi.  So all those people were not to be included in the Interahamwe, Tutsi and opponents or people in opposition.
Q.	Well, I mean directing our attention to you personally, what is your ethnic identity?
A.	I don't know whether revealing my ethnic group might necessarily compromise my personal safety.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think you can answer that question, as long as there's no name.
THE WITNESS:
I am a Tutsi, or I am Tutsi.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in 1993 and 1994 you had an identity card that was provided for you by the government.  Is that accurate?
A.	Yes, that is true.  I had one.
Q.	And in Rwanda, at that time, everyone's ethnic identity was mentioned on their identity card.  Is that an accurate statement?
A.	Yes.
Q.	How were you identified in your official identity papers during 1994 and 1993?
A.	In my identity card it was written that I was Hutu.
Q.	How did that come to be, Witness?  Will you explain to the Court how you managed to have an identity card where you were, where you were identified as Hutu as opposed to Tutsi?
A.	I had observed that the Tutsi were being persecuted, and when one needed to travel one had to show one's identity card.  So I chose to have written on my identity card that I was Hutu.
Q.	And how did you achieve that?  How were you able to make that happen for yourself?
A.	*********************************************** helped me to do that.
Q.	And when did this happen?  I'm trying to ascertain for how long you have been identified as Hutu, officially, in your commune.
A.	Ever since I received my identity card, and throughout the period I carried that identity card and even when I had to be given a new identity card, I was always identified on my ID card as a Hutu.
Q.	And when was this first identity card delivered to you?  Can you tell us the year, please?
A.	I received my first identity card in 1975; subsequently there was a file with my identity and then they merely copied what was in the file.
Q.	Now, with respect to your immediate community -- and here I'm talking about your cellule -- did anyone know, any of your neighbours suspect, that you were not in fact, Hutu?  You don't have to tell us the name of your cellule or your secteur.  Just tell us how you were perceived or how you believed you were perceived by those around you.
A.	Because we had grown up together from childhood and had studied at the same schools, everybody knew that I was Tutsi, because they knew my parents.  But in social life, in my behaviour, my social behaviour, most people knew that I was Hutu.  Those who knew my true identity were the people closest to me, who grew up with me and who knew my real identity.
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, during 1993 and 1994 you had an official status with the territorial administration in Mukingo; is that true?  In other words, you had a job with the political administration, with the --
A.	Yes.
Q.	Without telling us your cellule or your secteur, tell us what your job was and your responsibilities were.
A.	I was a member***********************.
Q.	How many persons were members of that committee?
A.	The********** committee was made up of four or five members, four ordinary members and the responsable of *****. who was the fifth member.
Q.	And what were your responsibilities in that capacity?
A.	Each of the four members of the ******committee were entrusted with a certain number of households.  They had to prepare reports, collect the MRND dues, or invite the people to take part in communal work projects, umuganda, and to report to the responsable of **** ******on all of those activities.
Q.	Did anybody have to report to you?  Was there another level of administration below you?
A.	No, but, in fact, I could have been the hierarchy or superior of the nymbukumbe (phonetic), the ten houses, but at the time there wasn't the ten houses.
Q.	So, in other words, you were in charge of a number of households, but it wasn't necessarily ten?
A.	No, it was more than ten households.
Q.	How many households reported to you?
A.	I was in charge of about 40 households, if my memory serves me right.
Q.	And then, Mr. Witness, you reported to who?
A.	To the responsable ****** who was my immediate hierarchical superior.
Q.	And who did the responsable de cellule report to?
A.	His superior, hierarchical superior, was the conseiller of the secteur.
Q.	Do you know how many responsables ***** there were in your secteur, if you know?
A.	There were seven cellules in our secteur, five times seven, that means 35 members of ***** committee.
Q.	Thirty-five members of the ****committees of which seven were the responsable **** and these seven reported to the conseiller de secteur; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And I think previously you testified that there were eight secteurs in Mukingo commune.  Is that accurate?
A.	Yes, eight secteurs.
Q.	So these eight conseillers de secteur reported to who?  Who was their hierarchical superior?
A.	You're speaking of the conseiller?
Q.	Yes.  Who did the conseiller report to?
A.	To the bourgmestre.
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, before, you had described being ordered to attend certain meetings in Ruhengeri -- in Ruhengeri town, and you had mentioned that orders were passed from the top downward, in order to get everyone to attend these meetings.  Would you explain to us your role on the committee for the cellule or if your status as a member of that committee was used in any way to deliver these orders to the rest of the population?
A.	It is clear, since the instructions came from above, and since such messages came from above, the conseillers spoke in order to transmit the message to cellule officials, and the cellule officials transmitted the message to the members of the local population through the members of the cellule committees.  In other words, I was a part of the system.
Q.	Would it be accurate to state, then, for these two meetings that you mentioned earlier, that you participated in getting the members of your community to attend those meetings?
A.	Those who could attend the meetings.
MR. WEBSTER:
Did we get the entire response?
  THE WITNESS:
Are you speaking to me, Counsel?
  MR. WEBSTER:
I was actually speaking to the interpretation booth.  I think I got a fragment of the response.  I can repose the question and have it reanswered. 
  BY MR. WEBSTER:
  Q.	Essentially, Witness, my question is, thinking back to the two meetings that we spoke of previously, that took place in Ruhengeri town, did you play a role, in your capacity as a member of the committee of the cellule, in getting people, residents from your community, to go and attend these meetings?  I'm trying to get your role in passing messages through from the administration.
A.	Since the meeting was held in the office of the prefecture, and since there was a long distance to cover, I did not ask anyone to attend it.
Q.	I don't quite understand your response.  Could you explain to me a bit more, please?  You are referring to these specific meetings.  Is your answer that you did not participate in delivering the message to your community or that you did participate in spreading the message?
A.	No, I did not say anything to those who were under my authority.
Q.	Well, if we think back to these two meetings, how did you become aware that you were required to attend these meetings?
A.	There was an Interahamwe leader called Borakare. He's the one who gave me the information.
Q.	And he did that because you were personally acquainted, or was it an official message of some sort?
A.	No.  I gave the message to all members of the cellule committee.
Q.	So your testimony is that you received the message officially, but that you did not pass the message on to the households.  Is that accurate?  I'm trying to understand your testimony.
A.	Yes, that is the situation.
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, directing our attention to 1993 again, could you distinguish when messages or information was passed on to you by the responsable de cellule, whether those messages were coming from the MRND party or from the bourgmestre as an independent government official?  Were you able to make that distinction when you received the information?
A.	At that time, be it the leaders of the secteurs or the commune, in fact, there was no distinction.  We could receive information either from the conseiller or from the bourgmestre.
Q.	Well, were you able to distinguish messages from the conseiller or from the bourgmestre from leaders or officials of the MRND party?  Were you able to make that distinction?
A.	Yes.  Since it was the chairman of the Interahamwe, well, I was saying that the chairman of the cellule was also the chairman of the MRND at this administrative level, so there was no distinction.
Q.	And then you also mentioned that with respect to these particular meetings, or one of those meetings in 1993 in Ruhengeri, that you were informed that you had to attend this meeting by a member of the Interahamwe, and you even provided us with his name.  Is it your testimony that when you received that message, that you assumed it carried the same weight as a message being delivered by the government?
A.	No.  In this case communal policemen could be sent to intercept or arrest  those who did not want to attend such meetings.
Q.	But you were telling us earlier that with respect to this particular meeting in Ruhengeri, that you were informed about the meeting by Silas Butakare (phonetic), and you identified him as an Interahamwe.  What I'd like you to explain is whether, at the time that you received this information, whether you thought you were receiving a directive from the government, from an official authority.
A.	I would say that at the time in our area, the administration was run by the MRND and the Interahamwe.
Q.	You mentioned earlier about the possibility of communal police arresting persons that did not attend.  Could you expand on your answer?  And I'm talking about your response from just one or two questions ago.
A.	Communal policemen could go and look for members of the local population, from their homes, or they could even go and arrest them in their farms where they were farming and arrest them.  They would confiscate their property.
Q.	And do you know who were directing these communal police?
A.	It was the communal brigadier.
Q.	And who did the communal brigadier report to?
A.	It was the bourgmestre.
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, directing your attention to your home cellule, without identifying it to us, can you tell us if many Tutsis lived in that cellule?
A.	There were two Tutsi families, but it was often said that there was no Tutsi in that cellule.  When reports were made, it was stated that there were no Tutsi.
Q.	And at the beginning of your testimony this morning you had mentioned attacks or reprisals against the Bagogwe.  Can you explain to the Court who the Bagogwe were?
A.	The Bagogwes are Tutsi who come from the Ruhengeri and Gisenyi préfectures in the north of the country.
Q.	Well, how do you distinguish the Bagogwe from any other Tutsis?  Is there a reason they were separately identified?
A.	To give you an example, they can be distinguished from other Tutsi because they speak differently from other Tutsis or persons.
Q.	Well, when you say they speak differently, are you talking about the words that they use or the accent in which they speak?
A.	They have words that are different from those that are used by other persons.
Q.	And you yourself, are you classed among the Bagogwe or not?
A.	I am not a Bagogwe.
Q.	Is there any particular area where there is a large number of Bagogwe in Rwanda?
A.	Yes, most Bagogwes are in Ruhengeri and Gisenyi; otherwise, others are in other parts of the country because they are working or trading in those other areas.  In fact, the Bagogwes live in the northern part of the country, namely the Ruhengeri and Gisenyi préfectures.
Q.	Are there any particular communes in Ruhengeri and Gisenyi that are known to have a high number of Bagogwe residents?
A.	Yes.  Before they were exterminated, there were communes in which you had a good many of them.
Q.	Which communes are these, please?  Please name them for us.
A.	In Ruhengeri commune you have Mukingo Nkuli, Kinigiuri (phonetic).  And in Gisenyi préfecture you have Mutura, commune, and an area called Bigogwe.  You also have the Kanama commune and part of the Kagogwe commune.  In any case, those are the areas I was able to go to.  In Keybera and Kiovu and I also think there are also Bagogwes.  You also find Bagogwes at Byngogo.  That is the Ruhengeri commune or préfecture there are three communes in which the Bagogwes are a majority.  In the Gisenyi préfecture there are also three communes.
MR. WEBSTER:
	Your Honour, I can stop here and we can take up this afternoon.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How much more time do you need to complete your examination-in-chief?
MR. WEBSTER:
(microphone overidden)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
As we said earlier on, we are going to take a break now, and we resume at 4 p.m.  We will be starting back late because of a judgment which will be provided shortly from now.  The proceedings stand adjourned. 
(Court recessed at 1400H)
(Pages 42 to 50 by R. Lear)

	1607H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session.  Good afternoon to everyone.  Counsel for the Prosecution.  

Yes, Counsel Roach.
MR. ROACH:
Madam President and Justices, I should like to be permitted to address the timetable that has been set up for the session.  In particular, with regard to Friday, I know you would welcome the input and the feeling of Defence counsel, or I should speak for myself, because I think my colleagues may have different views.  But any way, there is a problem that is posed by the Friday session, and that is -- particularly this coming Friday, and that is, that with respect to meeting with clients to discuss the evidence, we find it difficult to do that during the week when the Court is in session.  On the weekends, we do not have free access at the detention centre because of their own rules to meet with our own clients, and we need to have some time so we can spend with the clients to review evidence. And I am advised by the Accused, my client, Dr. Ngirumpatse, that in addition to the problem of Friday I just mentioned, that when the session goes much beyond 5:30, there is a difficulty that he has when he returns to the detention centre because they do not allow the meals to be reheated and prepared, so if he could be there for 6 o'clock when it is the regular meal time.  

So I am just sharing these ideas with the Court.  I know that the Court has very good reasons for setting its schedule, but I hope that the facility can be given so that we can meet with the client on Friday, especially those Fridays when we have an ensuing trial week coming up.  Those are my remarks, if it pleases the Court. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Roach.  

Yes, Counsel O'Shea.
MR. O'SHEA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I am on the same song sheet as my learned friend, Mr. Roach.  I would like to just inform the Court that this evening our team has a meeting with the third party which is of some importance in relation to the evidence in this case.  And, therefore, I request that the Court bear that in mind in that I will have some difficulty being here beyond 6 o'clock.  

In relation to the question of Fridays, if we do sit the whole day, this will, of course, cause particular difficulties for us, our client not being here.  

I am especially grateful to you, Madam President, for your indication to UNDF in relation to Saturdays, and that is of great assistance, but we are going to sit on Fridays.  It of course raises the other question, if I may remind you, we would be very grateful.  We raised it with the President of the Court. We raised it with Your Honours.  We would be very grateful if our legal assistant could be allowed to go down by herself.  We raised this before and I am only reminding the Court in light of these new circumstances.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Counsel for the Prosecution, could you please proceed.
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I note that Mr. Martel is not present.  Inasmuch as these matters also concern 
Mr. Karemera, and it is a precedent that I hope the Court will not follow, that it will proceed to take evidence in the absence of a lawyer for the Accused being represented.  I know what's Mr. Martel and Mr. Karemera's  problem, but perhaps tomorrow or some other time that will become my problem, and I don't believe that it is appropriate in a criminal trial to take evidence in the absence of counsel for the Accused.  I would ask that we do not take any evidence until Mr. Martel is able to be present.  
Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is there no one else representing the Accused apart from Counsel Martel?  Can someone inform Counsel Martel that we have started?  I did say that we were starting at 4 p.m.  I suspended the -- we adjourned until 4 p.m. and we have had to start, unfortunately.  We can't wait any further than this.  

Pending the arrival of Counsel Martel, could we thrash out a few issues -- a few matters that are pending.  

We shall see what we can do with regard to hearings on Friday, but it is highly probable that we may sit on Friday mornings in order to -- and we will try to adjourn as early as possible, at about 2 p.m., to give you enough time to consult with your client and do what you have to do.  We will also have to consult one another with regard to scheduling as from January when we resume sittings.  
We have received proposals from all parties.  One of the proposals caught our attention.  That proposal was made by Counsel Robinson and the Prosecutor.  What we have done is that we have simply changed a date, that is the date of the 21st, from the 21st of January to the 12th of March, and we have indicated 12th January to 12th March, but everything else ties in with the proposals you made, notably that from the 13th of April to the 28th of May, I have already -- I have noted that it is from the 12th of January to the 12th of March and, subsequently, from the 13th of April to 28th of May; 28th June to the 28th of July; 30th of August to the 15th of September and 15th November to 15th of December.  This schedule gives us intervals of a month each to give us time -- to give you time to attend to other matters in your respective Chambers. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
MR. WEBSTER:
A matter of coming back to this is beating a dead horse, but with respect to the second trial session which -- but Your Honours have suggested that we start or recommence on the 12th of January.  It's clearly the wish of the Prosecutor that we expedite matters as much as possible.  So I am all in favour of moving ahead quickly.  

My concern is only that the up coming break comes at a time when much of the Tribunal shuts down as a practical matter and clearly it shouldn't, but for a good two weeks very little is accomplished, and I am talking about the week right before Christmas and New Year, and this is really an exceptional situation in terms of our breaks.  Under normal circumstances, I think a month is quite enough but between 12th of December and the 12th of January, I am really quite concerned that we will have enough time to accomplish all that is necessary to make the next trial session as productive as we would like it to be, particularly since by the Court schedule, as you have just announced, we will have a full two months of trial, the 12th of January and the 12th of March.  So I am certainly respectful of Your Honours' concerns, but I just want to remind the Court that for the break that is coming up, it is not really four weeks, I mean, it is considerably less because as a practical matter much of the operation of the Tribunal is going to shut down.  It is not just a function of the Office of the Prosecutor.  We interact with the administration and I think things are very -- are going to slow down considerably from the 22nd of December to the 3rd of January.  So with all due respect, if you reconsider the start date in January, it may help us to advance matters for the next trial if we began at least another week later. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Would you like to make any remarks on the scheduling, Counsel Robinson?  

Counsel Roach. 
MR. ROACH:
With respect to that particular period that my friend, the Prosecutor referred to, we too have some difficulty.  It seems as though in the second session there are going to be a number of witnesses that would give testimony that would impact directly on our client.  And our team has not been to Rwanda and we are in need of a clear week to get there and to see certain sites that we have already identified as important ones, that we anticipate will come up in testimony.  And so, because 
I am -- in particular, I am from North America, and it takes me more time to get here, something more like the better part of two days, the one month period of time would force me, in particular, to have to cancel that trip to Rwanda.  And inasmuch as I will be doing most of the cross-examination of the witnesses, I think that would be a severe set back for Mr. Ngirumpatse -- for Dr. Ngirumpatse's Defence.  So if this session could start one week later, it would facilitate us.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.  I join in what has already been said, and I think earlier I presented to you the problem we would have in receiving the disclosure on the 22nd of December and being prepared to begin on the 12th of January.  But if the Trial Chamber is of the mind to keep the date of 12th January for the commencement of the trial, I would remind you that I have before you a pending motion to modify the protective order to require that all disclosures be given to the Defence and received by us by the last day of the previous session, because if I leave here after the 12th of December without any disclosure, then I am not going to be prepared for the 12th of January.  I will not have discussed it with my client.  We will not have commenced investigations based on this disclosure, so I prefer that we have a later start also.  But if you insist on the 12th of January, I ask that you consider my motion for the modification of a protective order.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, then.  We thank you, Counsel Robinson.  We have taken note of all the remarks and we shall communicate very quickly the new schedule, taking into considering all your remarks.  

Counsel for the Prosecution, please proceed.  I observe that Counsel Martel is in the courtroom. 
MR. MARTEL:
I crave the Court's indulgence for my late arrival, Madam President.  I had assumed that I could stay up to the end of the judgment.  And when we started the judgement hadn't been delivered.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We had decided to start at 4 p.m., Counsel Martel.  Very well, then.  

Counsel for the Prosecution, please proceed to cross-examination of the witness -- to the examination of the witness.
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I would like to begin by having the registry show three documents to the Defence and to the Court and then bring them back to me please.  
Well, could we have Prosecution Exhibit No. 5 before the witness, please? 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I would like you to open the bundles of materials that have been placed before you to page No. 8569.
MR. WEBSTER:
And perhaps the registry can assist the witness by opening the binder to that page for him, please. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, please repeat.  Please repeat the number of the page.  Please repeat the number of the page, and in general, try and speak at a more regular speed because we have difficult sometimes in following the interpretation. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I have asked that Prosecutor Exhibit 5 be placed before the witness and that it be opened to 
page 8569. The indication that the registry has placed on the page also corresponds to K-number K0164870. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, have you seen the drawing that is open before you before? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you tell us where it was that you saw this image before? 
A.	This is the road Ruhengeri-Gisenyi. 
Q.	Thank you for that, but my question is actually the drawing that you are looking at now.  Have you ever seen this drawing before, before it was opened before you in court today? 
A.	Yes, I have seen this sketch.
Q.	Where was it that you saw this sketch? 
A.	The people who came to help me prepare my testimony showed me this sketch. 
Q.	At that time, did those people tell you what was on the sketch? 
A.	No, they just showed the sketch to me. 
Q.	Did those people ask you to identify anything on the sketch? 
A.	They told me that I should say a number of things in respect of the sketch before the Trial Chamber. 
Q.	And what was that, if you can remember? 
A.	I was told that I should describe the sketch and explain it. 
Q.	And when they explained that to you or told that to you, did they indicate to you what images or what notations were on the sketch?  Did they give you information or did they ask for information?
A.	I was told that once before the Trial Chamber questions would be put to me regarding what I know in respect of the sketch. 
Q.	Thank you.  But my question to you, let me restate it:  Did anyone that visited you from the office of the Prosecutor tell you what to say in relation to this sketch?  Did they tell you the contents of this sketch? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, I am going to ask you to look at the sketch and tell us here in the courtroom today if you recognise it -- if you recognise its content? 
A.	Yes, I can do that.
Q.	Well, directing your attention to the long dark line in the centre of the sketch, can you tell us what that suggests to you?  Describe the sketch to us and tell us what you can recognise in it.
A.	Well, I see a line there that reminds me of the Ruhengeri-Gisenyi road and the other roads which connect to that main road, which reminds me of a certain number of things.
Q.	Well, if you direct your attention to the very centre of the drawing, where there is an indication of 
No. 11, the image right near that number, what does that remind you of? 
A.	This indicates the Byangabo trading centre. 
Q.	And if you look a little bit above that, there is an indication of No. 7.  What would the area around 
No. 7 remind you of? 
A.	That is the location of the Busogo parish church. 
Q.	Then, if you look a little bit to the left, there is an indication of a No. 9, and below No. 9, there is a little box.  What would those indications remind you of? 
A.	At that place, I remember that that place was the location of the higher institute, the Higher Institute of Agronomy and Animal Husbandry. 
Q.	If you look to where there is an indication of No. 10, and there is a little box next to that, would that suggest something to you? 
A.	Forgive me, my eyesight is poor, but I think that is where Nzirorera's mother's residence was.
Q.	And if you look a little bit to the left, there is No. 12.  What would that indicate to you? 
A.	That is the location of Nzirorera's own residence, a place he came -- where he came or went to rest. 
Q.	If you look at No. 19, towards the bottom left-hand corner of the page, there is an arrow pointing towards the bottom of the page, what direction would that be in terms of this sketch? 
A.	Are you referring to the figure 19 followed by the figure 01-01?
Q.	No, I am sorry.  I am referring to the figure 19 in the lower left-hand corner of the page, and there is an arrow right beneath the number. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Perhaps the registry can assist the witness, if you look at the exhibit. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It might help if the interpreters had a copy of this sketch. 
THE WITNESS:
That location is Nkuli commune.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And an arrow was pointed in what direction, please?  Would it be in the direction of Gisenyi or in the direction of Ruhengeri? 
A.	Gisenyi.  The arrow is pointing in the direction of Gisenyi. 
Q.	If you look all the way to the other end, what you have already indicated is the road to where we have No. 2 in the upper right-hand corner.  What direction is that road going? 
A.	It is Ruhengeri.  It is the road that is going in the direction of Ruhengeri. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, we have handed to you another document which is a Xerox copy,  a photocopy of this particular page in Prosecution Exhibit No. 5.  I would like you to refer to that sketch from now on.  It is the same exact image.  Do you have it in front of you? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Maybe the registry can help the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you tell us which page this is, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
MR. WEBSTER:
(overlapping microphones)..that I handed up to the witness through the registry, Your Honours, that I had shown to the Court and to the parties.  It is simply a Xerox copy of this page, because I am going to ask the witness to make indications on it.  And rather than contaminate the binder of materials, I would like the witness to make his indications on a separate page which we will then show to the Court and to the parties before moving it into evidence.  So the witness will be able to write on the page and maintain the integrity of the original exhibit.  It is simply a photocopy, unless if there is any objection from the Defence. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  There are no objections it would appear.  It was I who was curious to know.
MR. WEBSTER:
I would also like a blank sheet of paper to be placed before the witness.  The representative of the registry can show this to the Court and to the Defence before it is placed before the witness. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I don't need to see a blank piece of paper, that's okay. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I am concerned about doing things the proper way.  So, I mean, given the experience of this morning, I think anything I show to the witness should be shown to the Defence first. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Pray proceed.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, you have -- during the course of your testimony this morning, you mentioned a number of locations that were in Byangabo business centre, and you also indicated for us Byangabo business centre on the previous exhibit that we looked at.  

What I would like you to do at this time is to actually draw the main road that runs through Byangabo business centre on that blank piece of paper, and then assist the Court by drawing yourself some of the things that I am going to mention to you that you have already discussed in your testimony this morning.  So if you can draw the main road across the centre of that page and then at one end of the page, if you could indicate the direction of Ruhengeri, and the other end of the page, you can indicate the direction of Gisenyi.  It may assist the Court if you could indicate for us where some of the places that we discussed are located. 
A.	I have done so.
Q.	Now, the first thing I would like you to indicate is the bar at Byangabo which you mentioned earlier. 
A.	I have done so. 
Q.	You have also mentioned Nzirorera's mother's house.  Would you be able to place that on your drawing? 
A.	I have done so.
Q.	Now, on the drawing or the sketch that we looked at earlier, you did indicate the road that leads up towards the Busogo parish church, can you put that on your own drawing, the road that leads to the tarmac road and goes towards Busogo parish church?
A.	I have done so.
Q.	I am not quite sure if you have indicated this area this morning, but are you familiar with the place known as Isimbi house? 
A.	Yes, I know Isimbi house.  It was a house that belonged to Nzirorera and there was a pharmacy in that building. 
Q.	Aside from a pharmacy, did anything else go on in that building that you referred to as the Isimbi house? 
A.	Not to my knowledge.  I know there was a pharmacy in the building. 
Q.	Did you ever see Joseph Nzirorera in that location? 
A.	No. 
Q.	With respect to the building that was at the corner or the intersection of that road going up to Busogo parish church and the tarmac road, have you previously identified the building that was at that corner? 
A.	Isn't that the ISAE?
Q.	We move on from there, Mr. Witness.  If you could indicate on your own drawing Mr. Nzirorera's residence, the home that you identified as where he would go to rest. 
A.	I have done so.
Q.	May I take a look at the drawing, please?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter wishes to correct.  It should have been ISAE.
MR. WEBSTER:
If the registry could remain next to the witness and direct him to page 8548, and direct his attention to the lower photograph on that page. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, looking at the lower photograph, would you agree with me that it is identified by 
K-number K0275243?
A.	Yes.  Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Right.  Have you ever seen this photograph before? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you tell us what's depicted in this photograph, please? 
A.	That is the Byangabo training centre. 
Q.	When did you see this photograph before? 
A.	On Sunday. 
Q.	And was that also when members of the Office of the Prosecutor came out to speak to you? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did those people tell you what was in the photograph?  Did anyone tell you how to identify this photograph? 
A.	They only showed me the photograph.
Q.	You were able to identify its contents on your own? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	But looking at the photograph, looking at the image itself, can you tell, if you were walking straight into the photograph, you would be walking towards Gisenyi or towards Ruhengeri?
A.	Where I am here, I would rather be heading towards the direction of Ruhengeri. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, I am going to direct your attention to the 7th of April.  We are going to talk about events of that day, and I am going to ask you to refer to these exhibits and images to explain your testimony.  

Let me begin by asking you: When did you become aware that the plane bearing Juvénal Habyarimana had crashed? 
A.	In the morning of the 7th. I heard the news in the morning of the 7th of April.
Q.	Can you tell us where you were and what you were doing at the time?
A.	At that time, I had gotten up very early in the morning to go to Ruhengeri inasmuch as I was unaware of what had happened.  It was only when I got to Byangabo centre that I learnt of what had happened.
Q.	Do you recall around what time it was that you actually got to Byangabo centre, if you can tell? 
A.	I arrived at some time between 6:30 and 7.00.
Q.	What did you see or hear at that time?
A.	I heard people saying that Habyarimana was dead.
Q.	Did you -- how much time did you spend in Byangabo centre that morning? 
A.	I stayed there for about one hour, or let us say between 30 minutes and an hour.
Q.	And what were you doing during that time? 
A.	Because I had come to look for transport, I was with other people and we were astounded to hear the news. 
Q.	Did there come a time that you saw Juvénal Kajelijeli in the Byangabo centre? 
A.	I saw him. 
Q.	Do you recall how long it was, how much time had elapsed between -- at the Byangabo centre when you saw Kajelijeli? 
A.	I saw him about 20 minutes after my arrival. 
Q.	Did he do or say anything at that time? 
A.	He spoke to the young people, the Interahamwe, who were there, telling them that Habyarimana had died, that they should go and wear their clothes and go and provide relief. 
Q.	I am not sure I understand, Mr. Witness, "go and wear their clothes", could you be a bit more specific please?  What did Juvénal Kajelijeli say at that time? 
A.	He said Habyarimana had died, "go home and wear your uniforms so that we should go and provide help". 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter precises that the witness doesn't say who had to be helped.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Witness, when you say "provide help", can you be a bit more specific.  What did you understand him to mean at that time? 
A.	When he said those words, they started killing the Tutsis at the moment after.  So I think when he spoke those words he wanted to say that we should start killing.
Q.	Around how many people were present in Byangabo centre when Juvénal Kajelijeli pronounced those words, if you can remember? 
A.	There were many people, because normally in the morning there are many people at the Byangabo centre. 
Q.	Well, I mean, would you be able to approximate the number?  Was it more than 10 or more than 20, to the extent that you can remember? 
A.	There were over 50 persons.  In fact, there were many persons.
Q.	Now, you mentioned that Kajelijeli was speaking to Interahamwe.  Did you recognise anyone amongst these persons that you have identified as Interahamwe? 
A.	I recognised Michel Niyigabo, Musafiri, Rukondo, those are people I knew.  As for the others, I did not know them. 
Q.	You also mentioned that Juvénal Kajelijeli instructed the crowd or instructed members of the crowd to go back and put on their uniforms, were those instructions followed? 
A.	Yes, the instructions were followed.
Q.	And would you be able to approximate how many people returned in Interahamwe uniform that morning? 
A.	I think those who came back were Interahamwe.  I am not in a position to tell the names, but they came with their uniforms, so they were Interahamwe.  Of course, there were other people among them who were wearing plain clothes.
Q.	But directing your attention to the number of people that came back dressed in Interahamwe uniforms, would you be able to tell us around how many persons there were that were dressed in the Interahamwe uniforms? 
A.	No, I cannot know the number of persons who were wearing that uniform. 
Q.	Would you estimate that it was more than 10 or less than 10? 
A.	They were more than 10.
Q.	Well, if we said 20, would they be more than 20 or less than 20? 
A.	I was unable to count the number of persons.  I am only giving an estimate.  I would say there were more than 10, perhaps more than 20.  In any case, I did not count them. 
Q.	Were these the same uniforms that you described to us earlier and identified in a previous exhibit? 
A.	Yes, it is the same uniform. 
Q.	Are you familiar with Esdras Baheza?
A.	I know him.
Q.	Did you see him that morning as well?
A.	I saw him. 
Q.	What was he doing at that time? 
A.	He was a very influential trader in the Byangabo trading centre and he was the leader of the Interahamwe.
Q.	Did you see him do anything or say anything -- or hear him say anything that morning? 
A.	I saw him in his vehicle transporting people but I did not hear him say anything.
Q.	Who was he transporting in his vehicle, if you recall? 
A.	He was transporting Interahamwe and other members of the local population.  However, I would like to underscore that at that time, it was difficult to make a distinction between the Interahamwe and other members of the local population.
Q.	The persons that you saw in his vehicle, were they armed? 
A.	They were carrying traditional weapons.
Q.	Did you see anybody that morning carrying firearms? 
A.	There were firearms in the vehicle that was driven by Kajelijeli. 
Q.	When you mentioned the vehicle driven by Kajelijeli, at what time did you become aware of his vehicle? 
A.	I saw Kajelijeli's vehicle on that very morning.  They met me at Byangabo.
Q.	Well, it is your testimony -- or you testified earlier that you saw Kajelijeli in the centre that morning, that he announced something to the men that had gathered.  My question to you now is: At what point did you become aware of this vehicle that you have identified as Kajelijeli's vehicle? 
A.	When Kajelijeli arrived, he met me there and he was in his vehicle that morning. 
Q.	So your testimony is that you saw Kajelijeli arrive in his vehicle? 
A.	Yes, I saw him arrive. 
Q.	Were there other people in the vehicle? 
A.	I saw him there at Byangabo when he stopped his vehicle.  There were a few people -- there were a few persons in his vehicle.  I think that perhaps there were people who climbed into his vehicle when he stopped, but I cannot know whether he came with people inside the vehicle.  When he arrived on the site, he asked the young Interahamwe to go and wear their uniforms. 
Q.	Did you note any other vehicle at that time? 
A.	Yes, I saw a vehicle whose owner I do not know.
Q.	All right.  With respect to the last vehicle you have mentioned, describe the persons -- were there persons in that vehicle? 
A.	Yes, there were also people in that vehicle.
Q.	Were those persons armed? 
A.	I was able to see the vehicles (sic) that were inside Kajelijeli's vehicle, but I did not verify whether in the same vehicle there were firearms - or, rather, there were arms. 
Q.	All right.  We have mentioned three vehicles so far, one that you have identified with Juvénal Kajelijeli; one that you have identified with a driver that you have not been able to identify; and correct me if I am wrong, I believe you suggested that there was another vehicle that belonged to Esdras Baheza.  Is that your testimony? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Now, with respect to those three vehicles, you have mentioned seeing firearms in one of them, is that what you have testified to? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Remind us which vehicle it is that you saw the firearms? 
A.	It was Kajelijeli's vehicle. 
Q.	And would you be able to describe those firearms or the number of them that you saw? 
A.	There were many guns, I cannot know the number of guns that were there.
Q.	Right.  With respect to the persons that you saw in the vehicle belonging to Esdras Baheza, you mentioned that you didn't know who those persons were.  Nonetheless, I ask you, were any of the persons in Esdras Baheza's vehicle wearing Interahamwe uniforms? 
A.	Yes, most of the people in Kajelijeli's vehicle were wearing the Interahamwe uniform, but that was also the case with Baheza's vehicle in which there were a few people who wore the Interahamwe uniform.
Q.	And what about in the third vehicle that you mentioned? 
A.	The people who were in that vehicle did not wear the Interahamwe uniform.

	1715H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, when you mentioned persons carrying traditional weapons, can you describe those weapons to us, please?
A.	They were machetes, clubs, as well -- well, clubs of various types, stick, and so on.
Q.	Do you recall anything happening in Byangabo centre after the arrival of the these vehicles?
A.	A young man culled Rukara was killed.
Q.	Do you know Rukara personally?
A.	In fact, he was the first casualty.  Yes, I knew him.
Q.	Do you know why he was killed?
A.	He was killed right in front of me, before my eyes.  The death of Habyarimana had just been announced and it was said that Habyarimana been killed by the Tutsi, so I  think that this young man was killed because -- rather, Rukara was killed because he was a member of the Tutsi group.
Q.	Did you see -- the persons that attacked Rukara, do you know their ethnic group?
A.	It was the Interahamwe.  They were of Hutu ethnicity.
Q.	Did anything happen after Rukara was attacked?
A.	The attackers killed other people of Tutsi ethnicity.

Q.	Did you see these attacks yourself?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Where did the other attacks take place?
A.	Yes, I saw part of the attacks.  The attacks took place in Rwankeri and Busogo cellules.  Rwankeri is spelt as follows: R-W-A-N-K-E-R-I, Rwankeri.
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, tell us how you came to see these attacks.  If you could tell us what happened step by step between the moment when Rukara was killed and how the other attacks continued?
A.	After Rukara's assassination, since they had a plan to massacre the Tutsi, the attackers went away about 500 metres from there, where there were Tutsi houses, and they started killing the Tutsi.
Q.	How were you able to see all of this?  Tell us where you were and where the attackers were.
A.	It was near the road.  Since I had seen all that had happened and because I was Tutsi, I did not want to take short-cuts, so I went along with other persons.  And when I arrived at that place where there were Tutsi homes, I noticed that they had started killing them, so I took the decision to leave that place and I left.
Q.	Tell us what road you were following at this point.  You've mentioned on the drawing that we handed up to you the main tarmac road, is that the road you are referring to?
A.	There is a small road which goes from Busogo to the advance institute of agricultural and animal husbandry.  It is that road that I took, and it is on that road that Tutsi houses were located.  So that is the road I took.
Q.	And you mentioned two cellules a few minutes ago, you mentioned Busogo cellule and Rwankeri cellule, if I'm not mistaken.  Can you describe where those places are in relation to the road you've just mentioned?
A.	On that road which goes up from Busogo, the Rwankeri cellule is to the left and the Busogo cellule is to the right of that road.  So the two cellules are separated by that small road.
Q.	And do you recall the number of Tutsi households in that area?  If we look at Busogo secteur, which you indicated was on the right-hand side of the road, how many Tutsi family lived -- Tutsi families lived in that area, if you know, or if you can estimate?
A.	I'm not in a position to tell you how many home -- how many Tutsi homesteads were there because I did not live in that area.
Q.	Well, from what you were able to observe, how many killings -- what killings did you observe on that morning, on that road when you were -- as you proceeded?
A.	I witnessed the killing of one woman and one girl, and I decided to leave immediately.
Q.	And where did you go?
A.	I returned home.
Q.	Now, you mentioned seeing this attack. How many people were attacking?  Describe the attack to us. 
A.	They were many, very many.  There were the Interahamwe, members of the population, rascals who lived in the Byangabo centre, all of them were there.  So I'm not in a position to give you the exact number of the assailants.
Q.	How did they get to Busogo secteur were the attack itself -- these later attacks were taking place?  Did you see how they moved from Byangabo centre to Busogo cellule?
A.	They met me on the way because they were in a vehicle, but others moved on foot because they knew the area well.
Q.	Those that you saw in the vehicle, the vehicle you saw on that small road, was that any one of the vehicles that you had seen earlier that morning?
A.	Yes, it was the same vehicle.
Q.	How many vehicles did you see on the dirt road leading pass Busogo cellule?
A.	I saw three vehicles.
Q.	These were the same three vehicles that you described in Byangabo business centre?
A.	Yes, it is the same vehicles.
Q.	Did you see Juvénal Kajelijeli at that time?
A.	Yes, I saw him.
Q.	What was he doing?
A.	When they arrived at that place, they asked some of the assailants to attack houses that were on the left, and they asked the other assailants to attack the houses on the right of the road, and they told them that they had to start killing the people who were there.
Q.	And when you say "they", who are you referring to specifically?
A.	I'm referring to Kajelijeli and the Interahamwe who were with him.
Q.	Now, do you know if they were using their traditional weapons or firearms for that attack?
A.	They used firearms after my departure, because after my departure I heard gunshots, but initially, they killed their victims with clubs.
Q.	Now, you had mentioned some specific individuals that you had identified as Interahamwe: Nyagaba, Micheli; Rucondo, Alexis; Musafiri; Gato and Saidi.  Were these persons among those that attacked the residents of Busogo cellule?
A.	Yes, they were there.
Q.	As you travelled along the dirt road, this is the dirt road that you mentioned earlier that divides Busogo cellule from Rwankeri cellule, did you pass by the Busogo parish church?
A.	Yes, I passed near the church in Busogo parish because from that moment on I tried to hide.
Q.	Did you observe anything going on at the church at that time?
A.	When I arrived home, I heard explosions of grenades, gunshots, and people who were hospitalised at the Busogo health centre told us that those who were killed were the Tutsi who had taken refuge in Munyamvano's compound.
Q.	How far is Munyamvano's compound from the Busogo parish church?
A.	There is a distance of about 200 metres.
Q.	But with respect to the church itself, did you hear anything or observe anything going on in the parish church?
A.	What I am going to relate to you are events that were related to me.  I was told that the people who had sought refuge in Munyamvano's compound tried to flee to seek refuge in the reverend sister's convent, and they were killed as they were trying to flee.  They were killed at the current -- at the convent itself.
Q.	Now, you say you didn't see this occur, but is it your testimony that you heard the attack?
A.	Yes, I heard grenade explosions as well as gunshots. There were also people who had been admitted in that hospital and who had fled.  They were fleeing the killings, because the distance from Munyamvano's compound and the convent was a very small one.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'd like you to take the copy of the sketch that was presented before you before.
MR. WEBSTER:
And if the registry could assist by providing the witness with this highlighter and directing him to the copy, not to the binder of exhibits, the copy of the Mukingo-Nkuli sketch. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Could you indicate with that highlighter the Byangabo business centre and the road along which you travelled when you saw those attacks in Busogo secteur, and the route you took to get home that led you pass the Busogo parish church?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, do you still have a long -- much to go?
MR. WEBSTER:
No, this is the last subject area I'm going to, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, then.
MR. WEBSTER:
May I take a look at that exhibit, please.  

Could you place this on the overhead so that the Court can see it.  Is it legible on the screen? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We can't see it, Counsel for the Prosecution.  

All right.  Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER:
All right, turn it the other way.  No, you had it the right way before; right.  

All right.  Thank you. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell us what happened after you got home that morning?
A.	When I got home, I went into hiding because I had just realised that the situation was grim.  It was truly alarming and I ran the risk of being killed.
Q.	Did you see or observe any further attacks?
A.	Considering the fact that I was in hiding, I could not witness other attacks apart from the murder of an old lady who was killed on the 8th.  So I was in hiding and I couldn't see what was happening.  I didn't see any other attacks.
Q.	Well, directing your attention to the morning of the 8th, did you hear or see anything at that time?
A.	On the 7th, in the evening, I saw vehicles moving towards Nkuli.  These were vehicles belonging to the -- priests belonging to the -- priests in Busogo parish, and those belonging to the reverend sisters.  And these are the vehicles I mentioned earlier.  I saw these vehicles heading for Nkuli.  I saw them again in the morning, that is the morning of the 8th.  I could see them from my hideout place.
Q.	Did you hear anything that you lead you to believe that attacks were taking place?
A.	I heard gunshots and rocket fire, heavy weaponry, and it was said that they were looting a position where Tutsis had put up resistance against Interahamwe who had come from Rusovo.
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you say resistance, did you observe or did you hear about Tutsis with weapons on the 7th or the 8th of April when these attacks were taking place?
A.	From what people were saying, members of the population were saying, these were people who had tried to defend themselves with traditional weapons, that is bows and spears.
Q.	Did you see any Tutsis attacking the Interahamwe?  That's my question.
A.	That was not feasible.
Q.	Did you observe Tutsis with firearms on that day or on the 8th?
A.	I not only -- not only did I see Tutsis, but from that my time onwards I didn't see Hutus because I was in hiding.
Q.	But in terms of the attacks themselves, the attacks that you were able to observe, whether you saw them or you heard about them or you heard them, who was attacking whom?
A.	I saw vehicles that I could recognise, notably, the vehicle on which Kajelijeli rode and that of Baheza, as well as other vehicles.  There were also the vehicles of the priests and the reverend sisters.  I could recognise them and, to my knowledge, no one else could have used those vehicles.  And that is why I understood that those vehicles were being used by Interahamwe to go and launch attacks.
Q.	Did there come a time that you left the area of Mukingo?
A.	Yes.  At one time I left that area to try to hide, but I would travel at night.
Q.	When was it that you left Mukingo?
A.	I left Mukingo on the 18th of April.
Q.	And where did you go?
A.	I believe that if I were to relate the events as they occurred in their entirety, this would endanger my safety because I don't know who are the people listening to my testimony.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm not asking you to tell me the exact location, tell me the commune or the préfecture that you left Mukingo to go to?
A.	I went to Mutura commune in Gisenyi préfecture.
Q.	And how long did you spend in Gisenyi?
A.	I was in Gisenyi for a month.
Q.	Do you recall --
A.	Up to the time when the RPF took the country -- RPF-Inkotanyi took the country.
Q.	Did there come a time that you saw Joseph Nzirorera again?
A.	I saw him again.
Q.	Do you recall when and where that was?
A.	It was at the end of the month of June.  I was on the road in Mutura commune in an area known as Kabari, K-A-B-A-R-I.
Q.	What was he doing when you saw him?
A.	He was in a vehicle, driving.
Q.	Was he alone at the time?
A.	He was accompanied by Colonel Setako, S-E-T-A-K-O.
Q.	Were they doing or saying anything at that time?
A.	The moving -- the vehicle was moving slowing, the vehicle on which he was, and he was talking to the population that was fleeing.  The members of the population of Byumba and the Mutura had started fleeing earlier and they were in fact-- and he was in fact talking to the people trying to calm them down and to encourage them not to flee.
Q.	Did you hear him say anything at that time?
A.	I heard him saying what I have just related to you.
Q.	You don't recall his exact words at that time?
A.	I recall that he was talking to the members of the population who were tired and who were perhaps hungry.  He told them, "Have courage".  That is the message he delivered to them.  That is what I can remember. 
(Pages 63 to 68 by Gifty C. Harding)






























	1745H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And when you say members of the population, were you able to distinguish whether any Tutsi were around the car at that time?
A.	No Tutsi could have been seen at that time.  If there was a Tutsi still alive, that Tutsi was either not in the country or hiding somewhere.  This means that Tutsis couldn't afford to come out in the open and be seen.  No Tutsis could be moving about freely at that time.
Q.	So when Mr. Nzirorera was telling the people of the population to have courage, what did you understand him to mean at that time?
A.	I did not understand what he meant.  Perhaps when he said, "Take courage", he was talking - - bearing in mind the situation that they had been experiencing, the fact that they had been wandering about for a long time as refugees. I don't what he meant exactly.
Q.	Do you know if the interim government was present in Gisenyi at the time that you saw Mr. Nzirorera?
A.	The government that was known as the Abatabazi government was based in Gisenyi at the time.  Abatabazi spelt as follows A-B-A-T-A-B-A-Z-I.
Q.	At this time in Gisenyi when you saw Mr. Nzirorera, did you think that the Abatabazi government was protecting you and attempting to stop the killings?
A.	I believe rather it was the contrary.  If he had been able to see another Tutsi at the time, they would have killed him or her.  Those who put an end to the killings were the Inkotanyi.  As for the government, there was a government of killers.
Q.	Mr. Witness, did there come a time when you returned to Mukingo commune?
A.	Yes, I returned to Mukingo and that is where I am currently resident.
Q.	When was it that you returned to Mukingo?
A.	That was at the end of the month of July.
Q.	Would that be July of 1994?  
A.	Yes.
Q.	And when you returned, tell us what you found.  What was the condition of the Munyamvano family compound when you returned to Mukingo?
A.	Everyone had been killed and survivors were not living in that area.  I am referring specifically to those that sought refuge elsewhere.
Q.	When you you everyone had been killed, can you be a bit more specific?
A.	Members of the Munyamvano family had been massacred.  Only the members of his family who at the time of those events were not with the family are alive.  
Q.	Can you tell us the ethnic identity of the persons that had taken refuge at the Munyavano family compound?
A.	They were Tutsi.
Q.	What about the Tutsi family that lived in the Rwankeri secteur, did you see any of those people again? 
A.	Nobody was alive.  There were people who perhaps at the time of the events were working elsewhere, maybe in Kigali. People could have gone into hiding, otherwise nobody was alive. 
Q.	But when you say nobody, are you referring to the Tutsi of Mukingo?
A.	I was referring to the two families, notably the Rudatinya's family and Munyamvano's family.
Q.	Would you have an idea of how many Tutsis were in Mukingo commune at the beginning of 1994 prior to the events of 1994, if you know or you are able to estimate?
A.	I am not in a position to tell you.
Q.	Well, would you be able to tell us approximately what percentage of the Tutsi population in Mukingo survived after the events of April 1994?  How many did you encounter when you returned in July of 1994?
A.	They do not live in the same area.  Some currently live in Giswati and others live in villages such as in Mukingo but there are two villages and two group settlements and others live in Nkuli commune.  So I am therefore not in a position to give you the exact number.
Q.	Were many of the Tutsi residents of Mukingo killed during the month of April 1994?
A.	I would rather say that it was the final stage of the extermination of the Tutsis, because they were exterminating Mukingo Tutsis in 1991 and that massacre were finalised in 1994, during a period of less than three days; so, therefore, understand that very few Tutsis were left alive.
Q.	When you referred, Mr. Witness to the attacks in 1991, can you tell us when those attacks occurred? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I have an objection to hearing evidence of --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I object to hearing evidence of events in 1991 because it's not linked by any direct evidence to 
Mr. Nzirorera is charged with.  He is not charged with events in 1991.  This is a legal issue that was addressed by the Military case, by the Judges in Bagosora, and they excluded much charges of 1990-1991.  It was somewhat of a complicated legal analysis and opinion.  I believe that was on the 8th of July of this year that's now subject to an appeal.  So this is actually a complicated issue and I direct the Court's attention to that opinion in the Bagosora case which sat for several criteria that had to be met before evidence from 1991 could be introduced in a trial such as this.  So I object.  I object to such evidence.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecutor.
MR. WEBSTER: 
	I suppose I would submit that there is no basis to grant the Defence objection.  This is not the Bagosora trial.  Every trial is governed by its own internal logic.  

I made it quite explicit in the open statement in the supplementary pre-trial brief that the Prosecution is going forward on a theory from of enterprise.  Our theory is the case, I made it explicit in the open as well as in the supplementary pre-trial that the Accused are being responsible not only not for the crimes that they instigated and ordered, the crimes that are the natural and foreseeable consequence of their joint criminal enterprise to destroy the Tutsi in 1994, in order to fully address the attack in 1991 and the attacks in 1993.  Because in organising the common enterprise in 1994, the results of the crimes and in the full panoply of crimes that were attributed to these Accused, the natural consequences of their operations and their orders to destroy the Tutsi population.  And on that basis, in order to illicit or to ground our arguments in that regard we have to bring out previous attacks in nature and the consequence of those attacks so that we can prove that events of 1994 were forceable.
MR. O'SHEA: 
	Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes Counsel.
MR. O'SHEA:
I believe that Mr. Robinson has raised questions of some import.  It is a question which touches both on jurisdiction and on the Rules of Evidence.  I mentioned earlier that I have difficulty being here beyond 6 o'clock.

May I make a suggestion to the Bench that the Court hears arguments on this issue, because I don't think it is an easy issue, I don't mind if Your Honours do it tomorrow morning.  It is just a suggestion because I see that things have gone beyond 6 o'clock and it's my humble request that we adjourn.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Roach.
MR. ROACH:
I too have to leave at this time because my investigator is leaving the country this evening and I have to meet with him before he leaves for the airport. And informed him that I think perhaps I could have at 45 minutes with him before he leaves.  So I too should be grateful if this Court defers to adjourn at this time. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We accept the Defence, allow the Defence request and we will now adjourn.

Mr. Prosecutor, I would like to point out to you however that from what you stated, we should have finished some time ago. It is already 6 p.m. and you haven't finished examination-in-chief.  

So we should like to ask you to please accelerate matters when we resume tomorrow morning.  
We have taken note of the objection and of the comments made.  We shall render a ruling tomorrow morning. 

Witness we wish to remind you that you are still under oath. You should communicate with no one and we shall continue hearing your testimony tomorrow morning. 

Good evening everyone.  The hearing stands adjourned.  

Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution?
MR. WEBSTER:
Turning to housekeeping, My Lord, in terms of the order of witnesses.  I should be able to complete my direct examination within fifteen or twenty minutes tomorrow morning so that should not be a problem. 

The next witness, we are having a bit of difficulty with what was indicated in our original listing of the order of witnesses and I would propose to continue with testimony from witness RO, who is also identified as Witness CEA, tomorrow afternoon.  So if we anticipate completing the direct examination of Witness GBV, and taking his cross-examination tomorrow morning, we would be prepared to proceed with Witness RO in the afternoon.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, I heard you say that RO is -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Pseudonym, RO is also CEA. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
When will JB be heard?  The witness who was supposed to be here tomorrow he will be heard when?  Can you answer that question Counsel or the Prosecution?
MR. WEBSTER: 
	Yes, Your Honour, I would expect that we will not have a determination on whether we will ask DGE to testify now and that is what we are in the process of deciding and I will be able to communicate that to the Court tomorrow afternoon.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Have you followed? 
MR. O'SHEA:
In relation to the testimony of RO, I would be grateful if could just have an opportunity to consult with lead counsel this evening and report to you tomorrow morning with -- on the issue of that particular witness.  The meeting I referred to earlier today is a meeting concerning testimony of that witness.  We may need to make a request for extra time in relation to that witness, but I can tell you tomorrow morning the position in relation to that.  I certainly need to speak to Mr. Hooper.  I am not trying to hold up the proceedings.  It's just that Mr. Hooper is not here at the moment and I know that there are issues in relation to Witness RO.  So I am just indicating that after I spoke Mr. Hooper, I will indicate our position to the Court tomorrow morning. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We have taken note.  

Mr. Witness? 
THE WITNESS: 
	I should like to tell the Trial Chamber that today I am sick.  I was due to testify on Monday, but I was ill and in view of the questions to me by Counsel for the Prosecution, I feel tired at the end of this day and I should like that tomorrow morning, after the examination-in-chief, I be allowed to rest so that I might continue testifying on Friday after having sufficiently rested. I believe too that must be defended.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, what have you to say in respect of the point raised by your witness?
MR. WEBSTER:
Now, I completely understand this position.  This is a witness who has been ill and I mentioned this to the Court, yesterday or on Monday.  I believe that the witness was ill over the weekend and actually came to Court to testify and had to turn around because he was ill.  

But what I would suggest is that the Court indulges us for a day so that we reconvene tomorrow at 9 o'clock and that we consult with the witness at that time.  So if we put this issue in abeyance until 9 o'clock tomorrow morning, perhaps we will have a resolution over night.  The witness may rest sufficiently that he is invigorated tomorrow but I think if we address this tomorrow morning, we can probably address it tomorrow more effectively than right now.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We have taken note.  

The hearing now is really adjourned.  
(Court adjourned at 1810H)
