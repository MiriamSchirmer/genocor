P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Madam Registrar, can you open proceedings, please?  
MS. NTILATWA:
Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Francis Emile (sic) Short and Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam is now sitting in open session, today, Wednesday (sic), 30th May 2006, for continuation of trial in the matter of the 
Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Please, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  The appearances are the same.  

Mr. Robinson, just before you continue, there is one matter we would like to clarify with Mr. Webster.  

Mr. Webster, we have been deliberating on the Nzirorera oral motion for disclosure of information from a person named Joseph Serugendo, and our deliberations have reached a level where we felt that we should ask for further information from you.  At the beginning of the trial session, you had indicated that the witness, GHK, may be removed from the witness list, that there's a possibility of that.  Now, during the course of the discussions, you mentioned that the Prosecution may take a statement pursuant to Rule 66(A) of the rules from Joseph Serugendo.  Now, this information seems to suggest that the Prosecution will apply to add this person to its witness list.  And we would like to know -- we think that it is an important factor in our deliberations at this stage, and we would like to know if you can advise us what is the position.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Certainly, Your Honour.  I can confirm that we intend to make a motion to vary the witness list, to add Serugendo as a witness and to remove other witnesses.  One of the witnesses that we would suggest be removed is GHK.  We haven't filed that motion yet.  We were actually waiting to receive the Court's decision on our 92 bis application because we'd like to make one comprehensive application as opposed to doing it piecemeal.  But if it's helpful, we can certainly make the application with regard to Serugendo rights away, if that would assist in any way. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, we will accept your statement and act on it.  Thank you very much.  

I'm sorry for that delay, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
No, that was very helpful.  Thank you. 
WITNESS T,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Good morning, Witness T.  
A.	Good morning, sir. 
Q.	Directing your attention to the evening of the 6th of April 1994, I recall from your direct testimony that you learned of the crash of the president's plane while having a drink with some other friends and that you returned home after learning that information.  Is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that is correct, Counsel. 
Q.	And I want to ask you about the contacts you had on the evening of the 6th and before you went to bed on the morning of the 7th with some of the members of the Interahamwe committee.  So, first of all, did you have a telephone conversation with number 5 on the evening of the 6th?  
A.	That is very correct, Counsel. 
Q.	And because of a relationship that number 5 had with one of the people who were on board the plane, was he able to confirm to you that, in fact, the plane had crashed and the president had died?  
A.	That is correct.  Number 5 had a very close relationship with one of those in the president's company.  He was, therefore, able to obtain confirmation, in his own words that, Mr. Rugira, Enoch, director of cabinet, had, indeed, confirmed that all the occupants of the plane had died.  And he disclosed this message to the spouse of the deceased Renzaho, Juvénal.  He, therefore, confirmed the fact to me and that, to my mind, was a very reliable source.  
Q.	Now, did you try to contact number 1 of the national committee? 
A.	Yes, I tried unsuccessfully. 
Q.	Now, in later days, did you learn about what had happened to number 1 and number 3 on the evening of the 6th of April?  
A.	In the days that followed and during discussions, I learnt that number 1, number 3 of the national provisional committee, at a road check at the Kimihurura roundabout or thereabouts around the CND, that those two persons had been checked and were subsequently released, along with others, after they had disclosed their identity. 
Q.	And who was it that had checked them? 
A.	Soldiers, according to what he told me. 
Q.	Now, did you have a conversation with number 6 on the evening of the 6th or the morning of the 7th? 
A.	On the evening of the 6th, and on the 7th as well, I did not have any direct conversation with number 6.  However, I was able to talk to his wife, who explained to me that he was not at home and that he probably was at a road side somewhere, because he lived below a major road. 
Q.	And did you have any contact, a telephone call, with number 7 on the evening of the 6th of April or the early morning of the 7th?  
A.	No.  No, Counsel. 
Q.	Did you try to call Mr. Ngirumpatse on the evening of the 6th?  
A.	I tried, yes, but without much success, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, turning your attention to the next day, the morning of the 7th, when you woke up, I want to ask you about any contacts you had with members of the Interahamwe committee.  So on the morning of the 7th, did you have any contact with number 1? 
A.	No, Counsel.  I did not have contact.  I did not link up with number 1. 
Q.	And did you have any contact with number 5? 
A.	You see, it is very likely that I had contact with number 5 on that day, but the contact that I clearly remember is the one we had on Saturday, that is the 6th of April, I mean.  Well, we were all on the phone, trying to call one person or another, trying to find out what was happening in various neighbourhoods.  So it is possible, it is very possible.  And because of our friendship and our ties, I -- it is likely that I might have contacted him.  But what comes to mind clearly is the contact I had on the 6th, in the evening. 
Q.	Did you have any contact with any of the three Accused on the 7th of April? 
A.	No, Counsel.  There was no contact whatsoever with any of the Accused. 
Q.	Now, you stayed home the entire day of the 7th of April, but did you learn from your telephone contacts with others that roadblocks had been set up in Kigali? 
A.	Not on the 7th of April.  However, under such circumstances and in view of the communiqué on the curfew, I would say that it would only have been normal for soldiers to set up roadblocks under such circumstances, particularly those experienced in the night of the 4th to the 5th.  It would seem to me to be a great likelihood.  But nobody talked about any such situation to me formally.  
Q.	Okay.  Now, turning to the 8th of April, did there come a time when number 6 came to your home? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And about what time of day was that? 
A.	Well, I would say that number 6 came around 10:30, 11, 11:30, that was just before the end of the morning.  By the way, my wife had gone out for some professional duties under armed escorts on the 8th, that was before the afternoon -- or, rather -- yeah, before the afternoon.  And she told me that she went through a number of roadblocks that were manned by soldiers along the way from the neighbourhood where we lived to the office of her employer. 
Q.	Now, up until the time that (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover) -- excuse me, up until the time that number 6 had come to your house, did you know that the Interahamwe were manning roadblocks in Kigali?  
A.	No, not at that time.  He's the one who told me.  He's the one who told me that there was nothing much to fear and that he was surprised that we were still locked up, so to speak.  But he said that they were in contact with the enemy.  And somehow he put forth to me the benefits of the situation. 
Q.	Now, was it a reflex in Rwanda to set up roadblocks whenever there was a demonstration or riot or some element of disorder?  
A.	Yes, that was the situation, Counsel. 
Q.	And was that something that had happened prior to 1994 in Rwanda as well?  
A.	Yes, quite regularly, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, when you learned that the Interahamwe had set up roadblocks after the assassination of the president, can you tell us who ordered, if anyone, those roadblocks to be set up? 
A.	Counsel, I do not know who gave the orders, but, you see, when a curfew is in place roadblocks are usually set up by soldiers or by administrative authorities.  So I have no specific answer to your question because I do not know the person who issued the orders.  But one can presume that such orders were issued. 
Q.	And did (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover) ever tell you who had issued an order to set up the -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
Sorry.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The name. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I'm sorry about that.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Did number 6 -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The name is redacted.   
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Did number 6 ever tell you who, if anyone, had ordered the roadblocks to be established? 
A.	No, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, after number 6 arrived on the late morning of the 8th of April, did you leave your home with him and the people who were with him? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel. 
Q.	And you told us that you went around different parts of Kigali.  And during that time, did you yourself encounter roadblocks manned by Interahamwe? 
A.	The roadblocks I went through in the neighbourhood, in Kivu neighbourhood, were manned by soldiers.  And the roadblocks that went through in the popular neighbourhoods from Biryogo were manned by Interahamwes, MRND, by the inhabitants in general, that is, those who lived in those various neighbourhoods.  And the inhabitants took turns manning the roadblocks.  I can speak specifically about Kivu neighbourhood and the plateau, where the roadblocks were strictly manned by soldiers. 
Q.	Now after 6th April, did the term Interahamwe come to mean not only members of the MRND youth wing, but members of the youth wings of other parties, as well as members of the population?  
A.	That is what I have just said, Counsel.  And I could even go further to add that Hutu and Tutsi alike manned the roadblocks, particularly those Tutsis who wanted to demonstrate that they were not on the side of the enemy.  They therefore took part in the manning of the roadblocks in the security efforts, or in any other such efforts within their neighbourhoods. 
Q.	Now, we've heard evidence that the government had -- or the military had made a broadcast asking people to stay in their homes.  How was it that so many members of the population went out of their homes and went to roadblocks?  
A.	I cannot give you an answer to that question, Counsel.  I subsequently found out that some of the neighbourhoods in the suburbs, and I must say that I became aware of this only later on, apparently those neighbourhoods did not respect or uphold the orders on the curfew.  And I am not in a position to provide any reasons for that reaction.  The authorities, of course, did issue orders, but I do not know why some people respected or upheld those orders while others did not.  
Q.	Was there a lot of anger in the streets of Kigali on the 8th of April when you were out there? 
A.	Yes, that indeed was the situation.  And you would understand that under the prevailing circumstances, and even under the circumstances that had obtained prior to the 6th of April where things were the way they were, in the face of the political and military situation, people did not know what to expect, particularly in view of statements to resume fighting.  And after the assassination of the president of the republic, people became -- should I say crazy or mad, and frightened, against the backdrop of the hostility and the firing that was experienced in Kigali from the morning of the 7th, and given also the RPF declaration to the effect that nothing, no obstacle whatsoever, be it human or otherwise, would stand in their way, and that any such obstacle would be eliminated.  That, indeed, amounted to an ultimatum to foreigners who were ordered to leave within 48 or 72 hours.  That, I believe, explains or conveys the state of fear and tension in Kigali under those circumstances at the time when I went out on the 8th of April.  It was an atmosphere or a climate of war.  
Q.	And based on what you were able to observe, are you able to tell us whether it appears to you that the killings that took place after the 6th of April were ordered by authorities, or a spontaneous reaction by the population?  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I'm on my feet at this stage.  
THE WITNESS:
Both, Counsel.  
MR. MORLEY:
The reason I'm on my feet is that that's quite an important question.  And we have got the answer that both the authorities and a spontaneous outburst by the people led to the massacres.  The difficulty is that is a question of expert opinion in circumstances where the witness has already said he doesn't know where the order came from to set up the roadblocks.  I'm just a little bit uneasy that when we -- I mentioned yesterday the distinction between the witness being able to give evidence of fact and the witness being able to give an opinion.  And although the answer which has come back from the witness a moment ago is arguably of assistance to the Prosecution, I still stand on my feet and invite Your Honours to pay particular attention to the distinction between the witness being able to give an opinion and the witness being able to talk of fact.  And there it is. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, the witness has given the answer -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. -- what I was going to say is that we don't -- the particular point raised, Mr. Morley, may be more important at another stage of our deliberation.  I don't think that we could have challenged the question as being improper, and we don't need to exclude the answer at this stage. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, no.  Perhaps I'm being oversensitive.  It's a difficult area, this.  The witness knows a lot about circumstances in Kigali.  But we do stray from time to time into what he thinks is what was happening as distinct from what he knows is what was happening.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may continue, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness T, do you know of any orders from any of the three Accused to kill Tutsis?  
A.	No, Counsel.  I know nothing of that eventuality.  End of answer. 
Q.	And did you yourself give any orders to anyone to kill Tutsi? 
A.	No, Counsel. 
Q.	So who were the authorities, if you know, who gave orders to kill Tutsis? 
A.	Could you repeat the question, please, Counsel?  
Q.	Who were the authorities, if you know, who gave orders to kill Tutsis? 
A.	I don't know them by name, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, when you encountered the Interahamwe at some of the roadblocks, where they were present, can you tell us what interaction you had with them at those roadblocks? 
A.	Most of what was said was about the enemy.  What was said was about the enemy and its accomplices, not necessarily about the Tutsi as such.  
Q.	And what was your understanding that the Interahamwe was supposed to be doing in connection with the war that had broken out? 
A.	To fight the enemy, Counsel; to ensure their self defence, Counsel, because the Interahamwe had always been considered the enemy of the enemy. 
Q.	And how specifically were the Interahamwe supposed to defend themselves and to fight the enemy? 
A.	In the classic way, a natural way.  When you practice self defence, legitimate self defence against someone who attacks you, I think the way to do that is universal. 
Q.	So, did that include checking the identities of individuals to see that infiltrators were not moving about? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, you've told us that you saw the bodies of women and children and elderly people as you went around Kigali on the 7th of April.  How did it come about that Interahamwe killed the women, children and elderly people?  
A.	Allow me to make a correction:  I did not go out on the 7th of April and you mentioned the 7th of April.  So what I observed, I observed it at -- I observed it as of the 8th and the following days.  So perhaps you should put your question more correctly.  
Q.	Yes, thank you.  That was my mistake.  As you went out in Kigali on the 8th of April and you saw that women and children and elderly people had been killed, what was your understanding as to why Interahamwe had killed women, children and the elderly?  
A.	Well, as I said, especially as of the 9th, when I saw a young girl of three or four years, when certain manifestes - abuses -- a corpse doesn't really correspond to what you might term the enemy.  I realised that the people had erred in their discourse and there were excesses.  Some cases you can't make a mistake.  A three year old child, by its conduct, by its age, could not match the criterion of the enemy.  So I realised that they'd erred in their debates.  There were excesses, things had been lumped together.  
Q.	Now, you were, as a member -- well, as a superior of some of those people who were at the roadblock,  was it possible, under those circumstances with the anger that was prevalent on those days, for you to give an order that the Interahamwe should not kill? 
A.	Under such circumstances, Counsel, it would mean running the risk of being identified with the enemy.  Some people -- there were cases, some people were targeted as having aligned themselves with the enemy, and I could not venture into that, especially on the 8th of April or the 9th of April.  I did make an attempt that nearly cost me dearly, and I realised I must desist, because when I tried, timidly, to intervene in respect of the little girl I've just mentioned and I was given a message, a very clear and strong message, and unfortunately, I desisted. 
Q.	I think it is impossible for those of us who were not there to understand fully what the situation was, but it's true, is it not, that it was impossible for you to give an order to stop the killing on the 8th and 9th, despite the position which you held?  Isn't that true? 
A.	Precisely.  That is quite correct, Counsel.  And with my colleagues, that was my experience, especially on the tour, the pacification tour in Kigali, that the authorities had ordered in order to stop the killings, the massacres. 
Q.	Now, on the 8th of April, you've told us that you also went to the RTLM, you saw some names on the blackboard.  And had you been listening to RTLM broadcasts between the 6th and the 8th, when you arrived at the station?  
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And did you know that the journalists on the RTLM were fanning the fuels of violence in Kigali?  
A.	Until the 8th, I can't call that fueling the flames.  The news was of wartime events.  It was in the following days and following weeks that I realised that the discourse held in certain cases deliberately fueled the flames -- or fanned the flames, especially after the authorities had decreed or made a communiqué, made announcements calling for a stop to the slaughter.  So we must distinguish between different periods. 
Q.	Now, given your position with RTLM, did you ever order them or use your influence to attempt to persuade them not to make the kind of broadcasts that you have described occurred in a later period?  
A.	No, Counsel.  And it wasn't in my remit to give any orders to journalists or broadcasters.  I had no role to play.  Had I any role, it wasn't that.  But I can tell you that I was called upon to intervene.  I felt it necessary to intervene to correct an announcement I'd just heard calling for someone I knew to be killed, and I intervened, and that person's life was subsequently spared.  The -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
When he said how he intervened, there was a break in the link, so I didn't get that. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Was it possible for you to convene the members of the steering committee and to urge them to adopt a policy where the RTLM was not calling for people to be killed?  
A.	Could you clarify as to the period you're thinking of, aiming at, in that question?  Are you speaking of the 7th of April, the 15th of May, or the 30th of June?  In one case or the other, I had no mandate to call any committee to give orders to professional journalists, but to answer more precisely, or as a complement to your question, the situation was reported on to the people who had mandated us to cease the slaughter on the 11th.  When we gave our report we stressed the obstacles, the handicaps, and why it was difficult to get the message across, because of the other contrary messages being given as, in particular, that of RTLM. 
Q.	Now, on the 8th, when you were going around Kigali, you knew that the RPF had launched the war, you knew that people were being killed.  How did you feel about all that?  
A.	I had no special feeling.  We were all faced by war.  What sort of feeling can you have in the face of the war of the enemy who declares he will destroy everything in his advance?  I don't know what feelings you are referring to, Counsel. 
Q.	Did you have fear? 
A.	But everyone was afraid.  Even those who bore arms were afraid.  I think, when faced with war, everyone is afraid, even the soldiers who are fighting the war are afraid, and that is perceptible. 
Q.	Obviously, you are very well educated, very intelligent, a very competent professional person.  How did you feel about all the killings of civilians that appeared to be taking place on the 8th of April? 
A.	Counsel, knowing that the enemy's tactic consisted in infiltrating combatants who disguised themselves as civilians, my reaction, apart from what I said previously in respect of noting that there were excesses, that there were massacres undertaken as a settlement of accounts, well, it was a sort of feeling one can feel in the face of the enemy.  I'm speaking in particular of the 8th and 9th of April.  
Q.	And dealing with those excesses, did you favour the Interahamwe or other members of the population committing those excesses, or did you wish that they would be stopped? 
A.	Counsel, I will repeat.  I did not try; on the contrary.  The thing to do then was to congratulate, to encourage those who were facing up to the enemy, especially as it was not me manning the roadblocks.  So you can't not congratulate, not encourage he who is undertaking combat, or you would run the risk of being taken for the enemy. 
Q.	And on the 9th of April 1994, did you go around to various roadblocks in Kigali and encourage the Interahamwe? 
A.	That was not my specific purpose, but each time I passed a roadblock, that was what we said, and anyone who tells you the contrary will not be speaking the truth.  You could not -- not give -- you could not give a message condemning, denouncing what was being done on the 8th of April.  How can you denounce someone who is facing up to the enemy?  

We were in exceptional circumstances which are very difficult to describe with mere words.  I think that wars occur today, they have occurred everywhere, and the atmosphere does not differ from place to place.  It is madness, in view of the context that had already been in place for four years.  
Q.	I want to ask you just a little bit more about the events of the 8th or the 9th, because those of us who were not there picture dead bodies of civilians strewn throughout Kigali in what appears to be killings based upon an intent to destroy the Tutsis as an ethnic group so that there would be no more of them left, if the RPF were ever to arrive in Kigali.  Was that, in fact, the attitude that prevailed in Kigali?  Was that, in fact, the purpose for killing people in Kigali on the 8th and the 9th?  
MR. MORLEY:
Again, I'm on my feet.  It's the distinction between a fact and an opinion.  The witness can certainly give an answer as to what his attitude was, but I'm not sure he can speak for the attitude of everyone in Kigali, and this is where we blur the line between fact and opinion.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I can ask it in a different way.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness T, did you favour the extermination of the Tutsi as an ethnic group? 
A.	No, Counsel, all the more so as, in as much when the circumstances allowed, I came to the rescue of Tutsi that I knew or those who were close to them. 
Q.	And from what you observed on the 8th and the 9th of April in the streets of Kigali, did it appear to you that the killing that was going on there was for the purpose of destroying the Tutsi as an ethnic group?
 MR. MORLEY:
Again, I'm on my feet.  My learned friend is ingenious in the way that he finds his words for question.  The matter for Your Honours, it's the same point.  He's now being asked to speak for what everybody else thought and felt at the time they were murdering the civilians in Kigali.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, unlike us, this witness was there in the streets of Kigali on the 8th and 9th.  I think he has a unique perspective to be able to enlighten the Trial Chamber about the events. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
His evidence about the events is admissible, but his opinion, he's not an expert witness. 
MR. ROBINSON:
That's correct.  But I think he can testify as to what appeared to him to be the situation, since he was there on the ground, and that's what I'm trying to ask him.  Did it appear, from what he saw on the 8th or the 9th, that the killings were carried out with the intent to exterminate the Tutsi?  It seems like he can give us that information, and it seems like it would assist the Trial Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, intent is an inference which is drawn from facts.  We should draw the inference.  He can give us what he observed, which should enable us to draw the inference as to what the intent was.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well.  
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	Witness T, in your conversation was other persons, members of the Interahamwe, others persons that you encountered in Kigali on the 8th or the 9th, did you believe that the killings that were taking place were done with the intent to destroy the Tutsi as an ethnic group? 
MR. MORLEY:
That's -- it's ingenious, but it all went wrong in the second half of the question.  He can certainly ask, "In your conversations with members of the Interahamwe, did any of them ever express an intent to kill the entire Tutsi nation?"  That's a factual request from the witness about a piece of information from those with whom he spoke.  But where it went wrong is where he goes, "From your conversations, did you ever believe there was an intent?"  That's where the opinion is being sought.  

My learned friend is entitled to ask what conversations did the witness have with the Interahamwe, and Your Honour cans draw conclusions if there were conversations about what the intent was, but my learned friend is not entitled to continually find ways to ask for the opinion.  That's my submission.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, it's my submission that when you have a witness such as this who is engaging in numerous conversations, contacts, observations, about a very -- a event that goes to the very heart of this case, that I'm entitled to ask him to draw conclusions from those conversations, the things he observed, and to give you those conclusions rather than express -- or even expect him to remember, 12 years later, the details of such conversations.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, just as a matter of explanation by analogy, suppose the Prosecutor were to ask a Prosecution witness for an opinion as to the intent of the Accused.  It obviously would be inadmissible because the issue of the intent of somebody is an inference that the Court needs to draw from the facts that have been established.  

In this particular case, the question -- the information that you are driving at is information which would enable us to conclude what the intent was.  But for you to ask the witness what his opinion is of the intent of the populace is really a usurpation of a judicial function.  He can provide information which will enable us to draw an inference, and you will have to find a way of extracting that information from him.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness T, during your conversations with Interahamwe on the 8th or the 9th, did any of them express the intention to destroy of the Tutsi as a ethnic group as opposed to killing the enemy? 
A.	I confirm once more that the context of the war, the information in respect of the war was such that among the enemy the majority, the clear majority, were Tutsi, and so the intention -- the intent was not to eliminate, at least as far as I'm concerned.  And as regards some Interahamwe, some of whom were Tutsi, I did not perceive an extermination as an ethnic group, but in the facts -- in the events, that group was eliminated.  
Q.	Now, on the 9th of April, when you -- during the course of that day, did numbers 5 and 7 come to stay at your home? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel.  Numbers 5, 7, 8 stayed at my place, my residence, from -- as from the 9th, with the exception of number 8, who stayed with me from -- as of the 8th in the evening, the evening of the 8th. 
Q.	And now I want to ask you about the -- the events of the 10th of April.  Can you tell us approximately what time number 6 came to your house? 
A.	I would estimate the time of arrival of the 6th -- of number 6 at my place on the 10th was late in the forenoon.  You know, in times of war, one does not time events exactly, but I would estimate, according to my recollection, number 6 arrived at the end of the morning, beginning of the afternoon. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  And we know you're giving us your best recollection 12 years later, so if you're off on some of the times or dates, it's understandable.  

Can you tell us what it was that number 6 told you when he arrived at your house on the morning of the 10th? 
A.	Well, in fact, number 6 told us that the national committee was seeking to meet the members of the national provisional committee.  It should be noted that we were already -- that there were already five of us there, and it was impossible to contact the other members of the committee.  And we went to those who had summoned us to explain the situation and peradventure, number 4 -- we met number 4 at the Hôtel des Diplomates and as to the others, we explained that it was impossible.  What we explained, what were the circumstances of some of them, according to where their residence was located and especially because some of them were in an area where there was intense fighting between the RPF and the Rwandan army, very intense combat. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I'm on my feet briefly.  Just a point of clarification.  It may be that it doesn't trouble Your Honours at all.  When the witness was talking about the national committee summonsing the provisional committee, it may be that, as a point of clarity, it might be helpful for him to say the national committee of what summonsing the provisional committee of what.  It's a matter for Your Honours.  Your Honours may already have appreciate what he meant, but for the record, it may not be clear.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness T, the persons -- well, did (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover) --
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, strike that and I ask that it be redacted.   
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Did number 6 tell you who it was who had contacted him?  
A.	Number 6 informed us that the national committee of the MRND was seeking to meet the members of the national provisional committee of the Interahamwe. 
Q.	And on the morning of the 10th of April 1994, did you, in fact, proceed to the Diplomat hotel to meet with members of the MRND national committee? 
A.	In the beginning of the early, early afternoon -- early afternoon, we went to Hôtel des Diplomates in response to the summons, and not in the forenoon as you seem to be suggesting, Counsel. 
Q.	Okay, thank you very much for that clarification.  Now, at the Hotel Diplomat, were there Tutsi there?
A.	Could you be more explicit, Counsel?  What do you mean by "Tutsi" as you are saying it there?  
Q.	Were there Tutsi businessmen and their families who had taken refuge in the very same Hotel Diplomat where the government was located? 
A.	Counsel, when I speak of Hôtel des Diplomates, I'm not talking about the hotel industry, economic activity of hotel keeping.  I speak of that hotel because that is where I met the members of the government and the MRND leaders, as well as some high-ranking military officers.  But I can't speak of the category of clientele that might be staying there or not.  I imagine there were -- there was a clientele, but what I'm talking about is not the economic activity of hotel keeping.  In that hotel there might have been Hutu, Tutsi, Zaireans, foreigners of all sorts.  I did not check.  It's the first time you've brought up this matter.  I am speaking of the meetings which were held there by the interim government.  
Q.	Well, one of those who attended that meeting has indicated that he saw Tutsi businessmen and their families who had taken refuge at the Hotel Diplomat, and I was just wondering whether or not you saw any of that yourself.  
MR. MORLEY:
I'm on my feet.  I may have misunderstood my learned friend's question.  Is my learned friend saying that there's been evidence that there were Tutsi businessmen and their families taking refuge at the hotel?  Because my learned friend, Mr. Webster, and I have just been looking at one another and we're, in fact, a bit baffled.  On the other hand, if my learned friend is saying that he has seen, I don't know, reports or other witness statements or something like that, it ought to be clear to the witness.  Certainly, from the way the question has been put, it sounds as if the witness is being told that Your Honours have heard evidence that there were Tutsi businessmen seeking refuge with their families.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  If they were to consult the transcript of the 18th of October 2005, at page 29, they would find that evidence having been given by another witness in this case.  So, with that clarification, I'll ask my question again.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	There's been evidence that another person who attended this meeting saw Tutsi businessmen and families who had taken refuge in the Hotel Diplomat, and I was wondering whether or not you saw any of that.  
A.	My answer is that I did not pay much attention, pay any attention to the hotel function when I speak of Hotel Diplomat, but I imagine the place continued functioning as a hotel, as did Hôtel de Mille Collines and elsewhere.  Now, as to the hotel's clientele, it could have been any social or ethnic category.  But I personally did not -- now you're making me think about it.  It's now that you're making me think about it.  
Q.	Okay, that's fine.  It's no problem.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And, Mr. President, I'm about to address the substance of the meeting on the 10th of April, and I was wondering whether you would like to take our break at this time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we can do so.  We take the break now.

(Court resumed at 1140H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Mr.  Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness T, can you tell us what occurred when you arrived at the Diplomat hotel on the 10th of April?  
A.	I will give you a summary of the message which we received.  In the lobby of the hotel, there were several officials -- ministers, and we had some discussions.  And I will, therefore, focus on what happened in respect of those officials who had requested us to go to some accessible roadblocks and deliver some messages.  We met Mr. Ngirumpatse, Mr. Nzirorera, Joseph, and Mr. Karemera, Édouard, as well as Mugenzi, Justin, of the PL.  Of course, we had some discussions.  They asked us where those who were absent were, and we provided the reasons for their absence, which were quite obvious.  Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse then told us that, "You do not seem to have effective control over your people, because the Interahamwe are killing and dead bodies are strewn all over the roads, and that has brought some pressure to bear upon us from the international community."  

I do recall that Mr. Mugenzi of the PL, in the heat of the discussions said, "You, instead of attacking the important Tutsis, the pillars of the RPF, such as X and Y" -- and I do remember he mentioned the name of one Sisi Evariste, somebody whom I knew.  He said, "Instead of attacking those people, you are taking it out on children and women and elderly persons."  And he went on to say, "They have escaped and now they are at the Mille Collines."  And that was said in the heat of the discussions.  

And then we went on to -- they went on to say that it was necessary for us to pass on the government's message calling for an end to the massacres, and that vehicles would also be provided in order to maintain hygiene, for the dead bodies to be taken away from the roads.  So we discussed that problem and its feasibility.  We looked at the difficulties attendant to the accomplishment of that mission and the danger inherent therein.  We also tried to look at the route, or the itineraries which would be followed because, for example, there were parts of the city which were inaccessible -- Kacyiru and Kicukiro neighbourhoods, which were virtually occupied by the enemy, or the enemy was more present in those neighbourhoods, and that had split the town into two.  So the roadblocks that we were able to cover were located mainly to the north, north-west, and south-west of Kigali town.  

We, therefore, agreed that the next day a vehicle will be made available with an escort so that the neighbourhoods that we covered would be covered, and that we could call on the inhabitants to stop the massacres and also to clean up the streets by taking away the dead bodies.  We went on to look at the various difficulties that may arise.  And, in view thereof, they told us that we should tell all those who reject our message that government will exercise its control, and that whoever will disobey the government's instructions will be exposing themselves to some sanctions.  I think that, in very broad strokes, is the crux of the message which we dealt with.  And we talked about the various difficulties that may be encountered in executing the message.  And, in our own words, so to speak, we referred to this effort as la tournée de pacification, that is, the pacification round, or tour.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness T.  That was an excellent summary of those events.  Now, going back to the beginning when you had that meeting, can you tell us where in the Diplomat hotel it took place? 
A.	It was in the main hall of the hotel, but we went to a corner of that hall which was used as a restaurant.  So we sat around the tables that were used for the restaurant, and that is where we held our meeting.  At the end of which Minister Mugenzi invited us to the bar, a small section set aside for the customers of the bar, and we shared a drink, some beer.  And I do recall that in our discussions he insisted -- and called on number 8, who was a close friend of his.  He urged him to do everything to ensure that the family of his sister was evacuated.  That family had been blocked in Kicukiro or in some other neighbourhood.  And he answered saying that he, himself, had fled from that neighbourhood and that it was not possible for him to render that service -- the requested service.  
Q.	And is it correct that at that meeting on behalf of the national committee were numbers 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, concerning the people who were there from the MRND, I want to put it to you that it's been the testimony of Mr. Mugenzi, and it is the recollection of Mr. Nzirorera and Mr. Ngirumpatse, that Édouard Karemera was not present at your table or during that discussion, although he was present in the area of the Diplomat hotel that day.  So I want to ask you whether or not you have a clear recollection of Mr. Karemera having been present at that time?  
A.	Are you referring to the 10th, Counsel?  
Q.	Yes.
A.	As far as I can recall Mr. Karemera was there, Counsel.  
Q.	Okay.  Now, when the meeting started and Mr. Ngirumpatse began by rebuking the members of the committee for not having their men sufficiently under control, would you agree that it was obvious that no one from the MRND executive committee had ever ordered the Interahamwe to kill Tutsis?
A.	No, I didn't say that, Counsel.  So far I haven't said that Mr. Mathieu had given orders for Tutsis to be killed. 
Q.	No, I realise that.  But I just want to make it clear that, since Mr. Ngirumpatse and the MRND were complaining about the killings, it was obvious to you, was it not, that they were not the ones who had ordered them?
A.	I think it is clear, Counsel.  Let me repeat:  What transpired in the course of what I referred to is that Mr. Ngirumpatse and officials had ordered the killings.  Is that what I would have said -- is that what transpired from what I said?  
Q.	No, I think we're misunderstanding each other.  What you said was that no one from the MRND had ordered the killings, as far as you know.  That's my understanding; is that correct?
A.	I have not quite understood your question, Counsel.  
Q.	Okay.  Let me ask it again.  Maybe I'm not speaking very precisely here.  When you heard Mathieu Ngirumpatse complaining that the MRND -- or, excuse me, that the Interahamwe were not under the committee's control and that they were killing, does that confirm to you that, in fact, the MRND executive committee had never ordered these killings to have taken place in the first place?
A.	Let me confirm that I am not aware of any order that would have been issued by the national committee of the Interahamwe -- or, of the MRND, rather, the order for the Interahamwe to kill the Tutsis.  I believe this has been my position right from the beginning. 
Q.	Yes, it has.  And thank you very much.  Now, you were asked to go and tell the people at the roadblocks that they were to put an immediate end to the killings, and that the corpses -- the corpses were to be collected to ensure public hygiene.  And that those who did not obey these instructions would be liable for sanctions and would have to answer for their acts.  Is that the message that you were given by the MRND on the 10th of April?
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I'm on my feet.  There were four parts to that question, one of which was very important.  And it may be that my learned friend would wish to put the parts more individually.  When a witness answers, particularly through translation, a question which is a composite question, there is sometimes an uncertainty as to whether he is answering all four parts of the question, or simply that which has attracted his attention.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well.  Mr. President, I can break down that question.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness T, did the MRND instruct you to tell the Interahamwe to stop the killings? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, Mr. President, we didn't hear the witness's answer. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Could you repeat that answer?  It was not heard here in Arusha.  
A.	That is correct.  That is exactly the message that was given to us, Counsel.
Q.	And did they also tell you to tell the people to pick up the corpses to ensure public hygiene?
A.	Yes, that's correct. 
Q.	And did they also tell you to tell the people that those who did not obey these instructions would have to -- would have to answer for their acts and be sanctioned by the government?
A.	That is correct, Counsel.  With the specific indication that checks in that connection would be conducted, and that whoever would be identified as having disobeyed the instructions would be liable to sanctions from government.  
Q.	And was it indicated that members of the interim government would come by in the future and make sure that these instructions were being complied with?
A.	Yes, that is what I mean by checking, or controlling, which was to follow, Counsel.  That is exactly the same thing that I'm saying, but you are using different words.  
Q.	Thank you very much.  Now, direct -- I'm going to ask you if it's true that this mission that you called a pacification mission was really an instruction to focus the killings on the most important targets first, the Tutsi intellectuals, so that the killings would proceed with greater discretion.  And, in fact, what you were being asked to do was really to assist in the killing.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And, for the benefit of the Judges, that is found at paragraph number 38 of the indictment.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So my question to you, Witness T, is:  Was this pacification mission really a mission to make the killings proceed better, with more discretion, and make sure that Tutsi intellectuals were targeted?
A.	I do not have that interpretation of the situation.  Counsel, I have simply said what we were told, namely, that our mission was to seek to put an end to the killings.  But, as far as the comments or remarks are concerned, in relation to the militia who -- who fought against us, I think that is quite distinct from the position of the MRND, our party, and --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Rather, not militia, but minister.  Correction from the interpreters.  
THE WITNESS:
We were struck by the fact that the minister made that comment and that he went as far as giving us orders, because he wasn't someone that our youth wing held in esteem.  But, in view of the rapprochement, or the reconciliation, well, we -- one could say that all the suggestions you have made was not our position.  Whatever the case, that gentleman could not have issued any instructions to us.  He was not a member.  He couldn't have issued any instructions to us, but for the fact that he was with other members of government who were from the MRND political party. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, when you left that meeting, where did you go?
A.	Well, exhaustively, I can't tell you I went here and there.  We had to cross back across the road barrier -- roadblocks.  We had to go to Gitega.  And the day was coming to an end, so we went back to my residence, but I know that we went to the bar, to the drinking place that was serving as a headquarters in Gitega and not very far from the Hotel Diplomat. 
Q.	And were you with number 6 when you left the Diplomat and went to Gitega?
A.	That is correct, Counsel.  The whole team was together, that is, excepting number 4, who stayed -- or, even, if I remember, had to leave the Hôtel des Diplomate to go to the premises of the French Embassy where he'd found -- where he expected to be evacuated by the French soldiers.  I think the order had been given that we should not -- no one should stay beyond a certain time outside the premises.  So number 6, number -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I think he said -- he said it very quickly.  I can't remember.  He said 5 also, but -- 
THE WITNESS:
-- 6, 7, and 8 were all together.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, if you want him to repeat those numbers.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness T, we had a little difficulty with the translation.  Was it numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 that remained together?
A.	That is correct.  With the exception of number 4, the whole team stayed together but, at one point, number 6 -- when we separated.  So number 5, 7, and 8, and 9 -- 5, 7, 8, and 9, who were staying together, left together, before the next day's mission was undertaken.  
Q.	Now, I want to ask you about some testimony we've heard during this trial.  Now, was there a distribution of weapons to Interahamwe in front of the Hotel Diplomat on the 10th of April in the presence of Bernard -- excuse me, in the presence of number 6?
A.	Counsel, not in my presence at any rate, and I never heard anything about it on that date, the 10th.  
Q.	And in fact you were with number 6 from the time that he came to your house, during the time that you were at the Hotel Diplomat, and then until the end of the day when you left him in Gitega; correct?
A.	Counsel, I will repeat:  And I confirm that the whole team stayed together, moved together, lived together, resided together on that date the 10th of April.  I don't know of any distribution of weapons at the Hôtel des Diplomate. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  Now, turning your attention to the 11th of April, can you tell us about what time you commenced the tour of the roadblocks? 
A.	On the next day, the 11th -- once again the timing is approximate -- between 9:30 and 10 a.m. from Gitega.  I would estimate the beginning at being between 9:30 and 10 a.m. on the 11th of April. 
Q.	And can you tell us to which secteur did you first go?
A.	We began with Gitega and then to Biryogo.  In fact, we followed the main road that runs from the town centre to Nyamirambo via Gitega, and we continued on what is called Kadhafi Boulevard, which is a road that runs from Nyamirambo through Nyakibanda, Kimisagara, to the Nyabugogo crossroad where the roads from Gitarama -- Ruhengeri-Gitarama joins the road from Byumba to Kigali.  And that is the itinerary we followed because that was the -- that itinerary was the main artery where the main roadblocks were in that secteur.  
Q.	So focusing on Gitega, can you tell us where you went, and who spoke, what they said, and what the reaction was?
A.	In fact, the whole team was together, accompanied by soldiers.  Each members of the team would speak in turn.  According to the roadblock and the reception of the message, one speaker could support another, but I consider that everyone spoke as we had been told to, and we supported each other to convince people who asked questions, so there wasn't a single spokesman or a single orator.  
Q.	And can you tell us how many people were hearing this message?  Was it a large crowd or did you just speak with some leaders?
A.	Counsel, perhaps we better go over the way the roadblock was set up.  At each roadblock there was a leader who had authority, but in general we spoke to the MRND members who knew us, but around them were members of the populace or the groups who were manning the roadblock, but in general each roadblock had one or several people in charge, hierarchically speaking.  You have to imagine that configuration.  But it wasn't the populace we had together in a stadium, it was people in turn.  And we asked the people at the roadblock to pass the message on to other roadblocks, or the smaller roadblocks on the secondary roads.  We couldn't do it any other way, in view of the context.  
Q.	And what was the reaction of the people to your message?
A.	The reception by some was a good reception of the message.  By others, there was rather surprise, resistance to accepting the message in the conditions which were those of the time.  People would not hesitate to say, "Hey, that government of yours surprises us.  They are telling us to stop defending ourselves when we're being attacked.  Ask them, rather, to provide us with weapons."  Practically everywhere we went people were clamouring for weapons to defend themselves, and you will understand that by way of answer we were -- our discourse -- the logic of our discourse was to try to convince people -- to convince them of the good grounds for our message.  Some agreed, but when we threatened to report them, and that in any case the government said that it would be taking measures, sanctioning people.  So that was the state of mind of one and the other person, according to their personality, their various individualities, and the various roadblocks.  
Q.	And is it fair to say that you delivered the message as it was given to you by the MRND leaders, and when there was resistance to that message you threatened them with sanctions, as you had been instructed to do and, by the end, everyone had agreed to abide by those instructions?
A.	Counsel, you understood -- have understood what I said.  We faithfully passed on the message given to us to pass on.  We exhibited the sanctions that might be taken against those who were recalcitrant.  So we were faithful to the message -- we faithfully passed on the message, even if there was resistance we faithfully passed on the message.  And consequently -- and we reported that, as we should, to those who had sent us to deliver the message.  
Q.	I want to ask you about a few particular secteurs that you visited on your tour.  And first is concerning Kimisagara -- K-I-M-I-S-A-G-A-R-A.  Did you encounter some resistance to the message at that area?
A.	Mrs. Rose Karushara, who was conseiller of that secteur, Kimisagara, a feisty lady, a woman of character, she showed great resistance to the message and it was necessary to convince, to explain.  And we saw that she accepted, but reluctantly.  She didn't really agree.  So that is the secteur where we openly encountered reticence.  And another roadblock where we encountered very open reticence was at Gitikinyoni, under the authority of one Setiba, Joseph Setiba, where we openly encountered difficulties.  At intermediate roadblocks, people in their surprise would ask us, "How can you ask us this and that when we are facing the enemy pressure?", and that sort of thing.  But in that forenoon, at any rate, in the forenoon on that day we encountered open resistance at those two roadblocks in those two secteurs.  
Q.	With respect to Gitikinyoni, did you learn that even a Hutu, a man named Minega, M-I-N-E-G-A, a veterinarian in Kigali had been killed because he had tried to resist this Joseph Setiba?  That's S-E-T-I-B-A.  
A.	That is correct, Counsel.  That case came to my attention more particularly because that Mr. Minega, whom I had known since secondary school, for four years in secondary school, and stayed amongst my acquaintances in Kigali, we heard that he had been assassinated at that roadblock.  That is correct. 
Q.	Now, did Joseph Setiba hold a position within the Interahamwe organisation?
A.	Setiba in fact lived in Gitikinyoni, which is considered to be part of Butamwa commune I think.  Perhaps I am mistaken, but I think that is correct.  Mr. Setiba was, I think, president of the Interahamwe in that secteur.  Mr. Joseph Setiba attended our meetings, our meetings of the Interahamwe movement very assiduously.  So in light of that, I can answer that Setiba, although not a member of the national committee was, nonetheless, part of the presiding structure in that commune and that, moreover, what his reputation, what he was reputed to be. 
Q.	And after 6 April, did the Interahamwe national committee have control over the activities of Joseph Setiba?
A.	Counsel, I would answer you that after the 6th of April, there was no meeting held, no meeting called, as had been the case prior to that.  So the responsibility I can speak of is that hierarchical responsibility, but which in fact was, according to me, not exercised.  Was he in contact with one or another member of the national committee of the Interahamwe?  I don't know.  But the first contact we had with that Setiba was on the occasion I mentioned when he was very, very, very recalcitrant and we had to brandish threats for him to hear reason.  So did he just accept as a matter of form and then do what had to be done?  Well, this is all I can answer in respect thereof.  
Q.	Well, from the description -- 
A.	Moreover -- forgive me, I wanted to add that -- and as in the case of Rose Karushara, it was a specific item in the report that we made after our mission.  
Q.	From the description of the encounter of the members of the national committee with Mr. Setiba, it does not sound like a superior-subordinate conversation, in which a superior orders a subordinate to do something and the subordinate complies.  Was there a superior-subordinate relation between the national committee of the Interahamwe and Mr. Setiba, and -- in fact, after 6 April?
A.	Well, Counsel, that's what I've just said unless I failed to express myself adequately.  But I did say that no meeting was held, and so the hierarchical relationship and the administrative relationship which the national committee exercised over the various structures in Kigali -- I don't know if I've made myself clear or if I understood your question clearly, but I did not speak of orders.  I personally do not know of any orders formally given to Setiba.  
Q.	Now, when you went to Gasyata secteur, did you encounter an army colonel by the name of Muberuka, M-U-B-E-R-U-K-A?
A.	Yes, I did meet Félicien Muberuka, whom I knew well and who knew me well.  And he was trying, from what I could see, to tidy up or to re-in -- to re-establish order.  And he said to me, "You see, your Interahamwe are making a mess, creating disorder."  And I answered him lightly, because I knew him well and could allow myself to speak thus, "If it's true, then if some members of the Rwandan Armed Forces are creating disorder, some Interahamwe are also creating disorder, which is why we are trying to establish order."  These are the words I exchanged at Gasyata with Colonel Félicien Muberuka, nicely, without threats.  He did not threaten us. 
Q.	Did he appear to support your mission?  
A.	Of course, Counsel.  When he understood the purpose of our mission, in fact, which was his purpose also, he was following the same path, he was on the same path.  He was in charge of security in Kigali préfecture at the time, if my memory serves me right.  
Q.	Now, when you went to Muhima secteur, was there an incident where you saved the life of a man who was the brother of François Somayire?  That's S-O-M-A-Y-I-R-E.  
A.	Counsel, that is correct.  In the afternoon we continued our mission to Nyabugogo and other places, and Nyabugogo also we encountered considerable resistance in face of RPF mill -- intense RPF military pressure.  The fighting was on the hill opposite Gisozi, which also faces Gasyata.  And I remember that refugees -- you could see in Gasyata refugees fleeing the fighting.  

So, to come back to Somayire's brother, coming from -- after the little meeting at Nyabugogo, through Muhima on the main road, at a roadblock, we realised that a young man of about 17, 18, of pronounced Tutsi characteristics was going to be lynched.  And as we were passing on the message, we took advantage of the opportunity to tell the people at the roadblock that it is not possible.  We intervened and took over -- they began asking the young man questions who, we must say, we must acknowledge was going to get it, and we told -- he told us that he was waiting for his brother.  His brother had asked him to wait for him at Muhima and he would pick him up in his vehicle, and he told us that his brother, who was in a convoy, had just passed without realising that he was there.  

And after explanations were given we took that boy in the jeep, and he told us that his brother couldn't be very far and, indeed, we caught up with him at a bend in the road between Nyabugogo crossroads and Gitikinyoni.  And his brother, who I knew well, who other members knew well, was in an official car; he worked at UNDP.  And we stopped him.  And they realised that we were with the military authorities so he stopped, and we handed his brother over.  I can't say it was an incident.  In one sense it was an unfortunate incident, but in fact with an happy outcome and that boy was saved.  For me, he is a miraculous survivor because of that message of -- we were bearing.  
Q.	And Witness T, I want to advise you that our Defence team in fact contacted that person, who verifies exactly your story and also, obviously, offers you a great deal of appreciation.  
MR. MORLEY:
Well, this isn't a story-telling venue; this is an environment for evidence, Your Honour.  And one understands the logic behind my learned friend putting all of that on the transcript, but it's got no evidential value and it shouldn't have been uttered.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I agree it has no evidential value, but since nobody would let me meet this witness, I thought this would be my only opportunity to at least let him know that.  So I apologise if anyone is offended by that.  
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	Okay.  Witness T, if we could talk about your return to the Diplomat hotel later that day.  Can you tell us who you encountered and what you reported?
A.	We met the three MRND authorities.  Mugenzi was not there.  We reported, and if my memory serves me right, it was between 1:00 and 2:30 p.m.  I think we felt the right thing to do was to contact the same authorities and they told us to continue -- to carry on, and we agreed to report at day's end.  And so we submitted to them our difficulties in having the message received, and especially we told them of the nervousness that had prevailed in the afternoon on some people's part, and if the military had not been present they would not have believed us.  And we had run the risk of being taken aside.  At any rate, they did not agree that we were emissaries of the interim government.  

Of course, we stressed that most people -- stressed, rather, the request for arms.  That was the argument they gave us, because in face of the RPF pressure, because moment by moment, district by district, we heard of the RPF's evil deeds that such-and-such had been abducted, by name -- by name.  So, there appeared to be a contradiction.  And the fact is that we were asked to tell those people that the government will consider their claims, if I can speak thus, and we should continue to emphasise the message.  
Q.	Okay.  Witness T, I want to ask you about the request for weapons that you were receiving at the different roadblocks, and try to see if we can understand what these weapons were being requested for.  Now, did you understand they were requesting weapons so that they could disobey the message and continue to kill civilians, or were they requesting weapons for another purpose?
A.	I did say quite clearly that the argument they put forward was in the face of the RPF military pressure -- in the face of, and the news that they were getting because, in fact, people were telephoning, they knew what was going on in that capital city, part of which was occupied by the RPF, who was killing people, abducting people, exfiltrating its accomplices.  So they asked for weapons to defend themselves.  They even argued they would go as far as to say, some of them, "Even the weapons we were expecting that had been intended for us did not reach us."  This was the context in which they argued.  In fact, everywhere we went, they claimed for weapons -- called for weapons.  They said, "Tell the government to give us weapons, in view of what we are facing."  In fact, they thought that the government did not understand the problems they were facing.  
Q.	And did you believe them, that they wanted the weapons to defend themselves against the RPF, rather than to go and kill Tutsi women, children and elderly?
A.	Counsel, the situation that prevailed and its complexity, I think that in any war all the abusers -- abuses of all sorts, whether in civilised countries or in less-civilised countries, whether it be -- people be intellectuals or illiterate, abuses exist.  But when someone tells you he wants a weapon to defend himself, you can't say to him, "I won't give you one" or "I won't pass on your request", because you're running the risk of just indulging in circling accounts.  So your question is, you will understand, very difficult for me.  Let me -- I have simply been talking about the mission which was given to us, and the circumstances under which we functioned.  
Q.	Was it necessary for an Interahamwe or a member of the population to have a weapon -- I mean, to have a firearm to kill someone at a roadblock, a civilian at a roadblock?
A.	Counsel, you are referring to a case of necessity.  But let me also talk about the necessity of legitimate self defence which arose in circumstances relating to the leaders of the country.  So if that question were put to me personally, I would say that soldiers who -- whose weapons are registered usually have much more discipline, but in war circumstances all sorts of abuses may occur.  If the authorities deemed it necessary to provide weapons to people, under the prevailing circumstances, and in view of an open-end belligerent party who did not do any better, what do you expect me to say, personally?  All I can do is to tell the story as I lived through it and as I experienced it.  But now, when you require that I talk about the commanding mechanisms within the army and what have you, I maybe delving into an area where my testimony might be criticised by the Court and by others, so I'm here to convey the testimony that I have.  
Q.	Well, let me give you an analogy so we can try to understand the logic behind the request for weapons.  If you go and you ask somebody to stop smoking and then they ask you for a cigarette lighter, it makes you wonder whether they are going to obey your message, or whether, perhaps, they need that cigarette lighter for some other purpose, which is legitimate.  So as you were being asked for weapons, did you -- were you -- were you convinced that, in fact, the request for weapons was for legitimate self defence, or was it so that your order can be disobeyed?
A.	Counsel, this is the answer I can provide.  I do not know what the feelings of each individual who was requesting arms was.  But, as far as I'm concerned, personally, and under the prevailing circumstances, I found the requests to be legitimate.  However, what I want to be clear is that we were acting as government intermediaries.  We had a mission, we had to deliver a message; this is what we did, and then we reported on the reactions on the ground.  We did provide that report.  So, to be very specific, under those circumstances, I would believe that the request for weapons was justified.  But the issue of their proper use or improper use is another issue entirely, and on that one I have no answer for you.  
Q.	Now, when you came back at the end of the day and reported on your mission to the members of the MRND, was there any discussion of other methods that could be taken to stop the killing, in addition to your mission?
A.	We did underscore the difficulties inherent in the message and the contradictions that made it difficult to convey those -- that message.  And that government should understand that it was difficult to convey that message, and, therefore, be aware of the difficulties on the ground.  At any rate, I do understand that those who ordered that mission were in a position to complement it with other missions.  I believe that we could all see that that approach alone was not sufficient to quell the problems.  

Your question seems to wonder whether we did suggest other approaches.  What we did was to highlight the difficulties that were raised by other stakeholders who, in their reaction, actually annulled the efficiency of the mission.  Yes, of course, we did make suggestions, initially, prior to accepting that mission because it wasn't obvious that it would work fully under those circumstances.  

Maybe I do not understand you very well, but it would seem to me that you are saying that we should have acted in the stead of government in respect of the means and approach.  I don't know if I'm mistaken in interpreting your question in that manner, Counsel.  
Q.	Well, I'm actually asking whether there was a specific discussion at the end of the day of the 11th about other means that could be used to reinforce the message, such as the use of the army, the gendarmerie, or the radio?  
A.	Counsel, I cannot tell you that this issue or that suggestion was put forth formally.  What we underscored was that the RTLM message was counterproductive in view of our own message.  May I say further that the RTLM did speak about the reality, and we had nothing else to say about that.  It was clear to our minds that government would understand, and that government would be in a position to know what appropriate measures to take under the circumstances.  You see, government is not just any kind of institution; it is government, and they are there to govern.  So I cannot state formally that we made the suggestion and they rejected it, and we made this other suggestion and they didn't entertain it.  What I can say is that we insisted on the fact that the messages from the RTLM were contrary to the efficiency that could have been expected from our own message, given the circumstances and the context at the time.  
Q.	Now, I want to talk to you about some of the things that were broadcast on the radio from the government during this period.  And, in particular, I have asked if you could review a number of communiqués and speeches, most of which are already in evidence in this case.  And I'm wondering, for example, if you had that opportunity to review the communiqués of the ministry of defence that were issued on the 7th of April, which are Exhibits D. NZ18 and 19; and the speech of President Sindikubwabo on the 8th of April, which was D. NZ29; and the communiqué from Préfet Renzaho on the 8th of April, which is Exhibit D. NZ72; and the communiqué by five political parties on the 10th of April, which is Exhibit D. NZ21; and the statement of Mr. Ngirumpatse on the 10th of April, on the radio, which is Exhibit D. NZ22; and the speeches of President Sindikubwabo and Prime Minister Kambanda on the 10th of April, which are Exhibits D. NZ23 and 24; and the communiqué of Préfet Renzaho on the 10th of April, which is exhibit D. NZ74; and a speech of Prime Minister Kambanda, after the meeting with the préfets on the 11th of April, which is D. NZ23.  So have you had the opportunity to look at those broadcasts which were made during that period, made by government officials?
A.	Over the weekend, I was able to leaf through that rather voluminous document which was made available to me.  Yes, indeed, I looked through those messages. 
Q.	And would you agree that during that period, the government was consistently asking people to stop the killing, in addition to having you do your pacification tour?  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I'm on my feet.  The question is interesting because it's in the context of everything that has been listed a moment ago as being "broadcasts".  Insofar as the question which has just been asked goes, that is a legitimate question, but the danger is that Your Honours will be invited to conclude that the answer which is given from the witness is an answer which is based on everything that was read in the various documents.  And it would be wrong for the various documents to be simply summarised in the way that they are arguably summarised in the question which was asked a moment ago.  In other words, the question of itself is all right, but it's in the context of it suggesting that all those broadcasts meant there was a consistent effort by the government.  And we all know, from having seen the broadcasts, that reading them is rather instructive.  So what I would invite is caution, insofar as whatever the answer is, because the answer to the question maybe one thing, but the context of the speeches is another.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I -- these are documents which are already admitted in evidence, and my aim was to find a way in which to go through those documents in a somewhat of a summary fashion and make my point in a general way.  Now, if Mr. Morley is correct and it's more important to the Trial Chamber that each speech be looked at, we can do that.  I think it would add about two days to my examination, but I'm willing to do that if it's important to the Trial Chamber.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I'm not suggesting that.  All I'm suggesting is that, from the way in which my learned friend has structured, as always, ingeniously, his questioning, one would be forgiven for thinking that the answer which is about to come is a proper summary of all those documents.  And it can't be, because there's an awful lot of material there.  The witness is perfectly entitled to give his understanding of what the government line was, but for the answer to mean that that is an accurate reflection of all those documents, that would be wrong.  Does Your Honour see the distinction?  The question could have been asked -- 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I understand the point.  You know, what I'm wondering, really, is that -- we are judges, you see.  We see the question and we see the answer.  And this seems very clear to me, but I wasn't quite certain how dangerous it was on the record.  That's what I was evaluating.  
MR. MORLEY:
Well, that's very reassuring, Your Honour.  I'm just conscious of large amounts of material being inadequately summarised, but if Your Honour is already on the ball and I'm slower and further behind Your Honour, then that's, perhaps, to be expected.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, you may continue.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness T, did you have an opportunity to go through those documents over the weekend, and would you agree that the government was consistently issuing messages on the radio asking people to stop the killing?
A.	Yes, that is correct, Counsel.  From the little that I was able to pick up, as well as all I was aware of, in terms of messages as contained in the document, I think they are a fair reflection, because, at that time, that is, the first 10 days of the month, and that was a time when I was in Kigali, I can say that things were not static at all, things were changing hour by hour, one might even say.  So from the various messages that I looked through, yes indeed, they did refer to the situation prevailing at the time, as well as to the actions, the interactions, and the conduct of the belligerent party, namely, the RPF, the other significant party representing the international community as well.  So we were dealing with a very dynamic context which evolved quite rapidly and was not static.  So the various speeches, may I say, did reflect the situation as it evolved in within the country, that is, within Rwanda or, at the very least, in Kigali.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness T.
MR. ROBINSON:
Perhaps at this time we could take a break, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will adjourn for lunch now. 
(Court recessed from 1302H to 1435H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon everybody.  

Mr. Robinson, you may proceed when you're ready.  

MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, I just want to give you a progress report of how we're doing.  I think you will be happy to know that I now think that I can finish my cross-examination some time tomorrow morning.  So we are moving quickly.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Maybe it doesn't seem like it's quickly, but --
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, no, we had noticed already that you had been progressing quite well.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Witness T, are you there? 
A.	I'm online, Counsel.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  Now, if you can be given document number 4 in my letter of 10 May 2006 to Mr. Hometowu, which is -- was attached to the letter -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I'm sorry to interrupt your question, but it's really an administrative comment.  The Chamber has decided that everybody will benefit from your -- the efficiency of your cross-examination and we will not sit on Friday afternoon.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Thank you.  I'm sure there will be a lot of happy people about that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sure.  I'm sure.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness T, if you could look at document number 4 once it's located.  This is a speech of Augustin Bizimana, minister of defence, in French, at number K0244192 and K0244193.  And if you could let me know when you have that.
A.	I have the document before me, Counsel.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would like to offer this speech as Exhibit D. NZ125.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  How many languages do you -- 

MR. ROBINSON:
I have it only in French.  I'm going to -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, would there be a translation?  
MR. MORLEY:
(Microphone not activated)  Let me start that again.  I'm not sure.  I've been looking at a document in my hand.  I'm not sure if it's the same document that my learned friend is putting forward.  Can he remind me -- he said D. NZ25, was it?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  This is a new exhibit, it's now being offered as Exhibit D. NZ125, and it's number 4 on my list of exhibits to be used with this witness. 
MR. MORLEY:
It's in French at the moment, and we'll have a look to see if we've got it in English. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
To be admitted.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
If the translation could be found, we could be -- adjust the admission to incorporate it.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ125 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Thank you.  Mr. President, at this time it's a very short speech, and I would like to have my legal assistant, Nsengiyumva, read it.  
MR. NSENGIYUMVA:
"Rwandans, following the tragic death of the head of state, the 6th of April 1994, throughout the country some members of the population attacked -- unjustly attacked their neighbours, mostly due to anger.  Many innocent people were targeted in this unrest.  Rwandan citizens, you certainly know that the enemy who attacked Rwanda spared no one.  You're also aware that one of the strategies used is to divide Rwandans in order to obtain their objectives.  That is the reason why you're requested to avoid anything that can cause confusion among you.  You should, instead, collaborate much more to vanquish the enemy once and for all, the enemy that has attacked our country.  The local authorities are requested to do their best to put a stop to the unrest wherever it is manifested.  They must also organise meetings with the population, urging it to live in harmony, defend itself more, and look for the enemy everywhere in order to vanquish the enemy once and for all.  This is an urgent request to all major stations, in particular Radio Rwanda, Radio RTLM, as well as Radio Muhabura, wherever they are transmitting, to desist from any remarks -- making any remarks that would cause division amongst Rwandans.  We can no longer tolerate bloodletting.  And we would like the media to help us to cultivate the spirit of tolerance amongst Rwandans, for the population to stop killing each other so that peace is restored to our country."  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. Nsengiyumva.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, witness T, this is one example, at least, of a call by a representative of the government to the RTLM and other radio stations to stop the rhetoric.  Do you know whether or not this call by the government was obeyed by RTLM or Radio Muhabura?
A.	To a certain extent, yes, because -- obviously, here I am not including Radio Muhabura, which I never listened to, which I would be surprised that it would have subscribed to the invitation by Rwandan authorities.  So I would say that the radio stations, that is, RTLM and Radio Rwanda were broadcasting communiqués and instructions, directives by the authorities as and when they received such directives from the authorities.  However, sometimes the plurality of messages often would lead to a, sort of, double speak, but it is clear that the radio stations broadcast messages that called for peace and national harmony as the time went on.

1457H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And are you -- 
A.	He is a native of the city of Kigali.
Q.	And are you aware that today he is the minister of defence in Rwanda? 
A.	I have been so informed, Counsel.  
Q.	Now, from what you observed in Kigali and from what you know of the situation, if there were resources available for the army to have stopped the killings during the time that General Gatsinzi was chief of staff, do you think that could have been accomplished and would have -- would have been accomplished? 
A.	I'm sorry, I did not quite understand the sense of the question.  
Q.	Okay.  Well, let me try -- go on to a different way of trying to do this.  And I'm going to have you look at number three in the packet of materials that was sent on the 10th of May 2006.  This is also a broadcast from the Radio Rwanda, I believe, and it is K0144451 through K0144460.  And it's an interview with Augustin Bizimana, the minister of defence.  It starts on the second page.  And I'm going to direct your attention to a certain portion of this interview.  
MR. ROBINSON:
But first I will ask if it may be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ126. 
MR. MORLEY:
First of all, forgive me for being slow, but what number document is this and which bundle?  
MR. ROBINSON:
This is number three in the materials that were sent to Mr. Hometowu on the 10th of May 2006.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  

Secondly, and this is why I'm on my feet -- well, this is the usual problem.  We've got a document going under the witness -- witness's nose, which is going to be read into the record -- fair enough.  But have we established in any way whether the witness is aware of what it is that Bizimana said on this particular day?  Is there any foundation for the witness being asked to express a view about what it is that Bizimana will be shown to have said on the radio?  It's -- it's a perpetual problem.  I'm not quite sure how to address it, Your Honour, but it very often seems to me that one is putting the cart before the horse and effectively feeding the witness a series of observations not based on the witness's own knowledge, and those observations which have been feed the witness take the form of the witness being told what was in radio broadcasts and then being invited to comment and effectively being put in the position of being an expert.  

Now, I don't know what the answer is to this particular problem.  We see it time and again.  But I just remain uneasy about eliciting evidence in this way.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, this is something we seem to encounter frequently, and I seem to be able to convince you that the exhibit should be admitted.  Once the exhibit is admitted, it can be read, parts of it, and then questions can be put to the witness based on that.  So that's what I'm trying to do. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's fair enough.  You see, I think there's an underlying problem which has to do with the issue of what types of opinion or comment you can elicit from this witness.  And I think you know what the problem is.  I think you know what the legal issue is, and I think that is the underlying problem here.  

Again, to -- I'm not of a mind at this stage to prevent you from asking the question, but -- but the point is that the -- this type of opinion from the witness does not have very much probative value when it is elicited in this manner. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I understand that, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's (unintelligible). 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Well, let me proceed, and we'll see how I can do. 
JUDGE SHORT:
But, Mr. Robinson, don't you think it useful to find out from the witness whether he's aware of this particular -- was it an interview you mentioned?  Let's assume the witness has never heard the interview and this is the first time he's been shown this interview.  What would you seek to get out of the witness from this interview?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Well, I think that's a very good question, and I give you an example from the previous one that we've already heard.  The witness testified that he thought that the MRND leaders should have taken some steps to discourage RTLM from broadcasting.  So I introduced a speech from the MRND minister of defence in which he was urging the RTLM to stop their divisive broadcasts.  And so I was directly addressing a point raised by his testimony.  And then I was asking him to comment on that.  So, to me, whether he had contemporaneously heard that or was aware of that at the time or not is not necessarily preclusive as to whether or not I can enquire about that because it goes directly to a matter covered by his testimony. 

Now, what I'm trying to do is basically the same thing with respect to the use of the army.  The witness has suggested that the MRND could have sought that -- for the army to stop the killings, and now we have a speech in which the secretary of defence -- the minister of defence says that the army is unable to do that, given the war situation.  So I think I'm entitled to put this into evidence, and I'm not so sure it makes any difference whether he heard that at the time and he hears it now.  And now I want to ask him to comment on that.  So -- 
JUDGE SHORT:
You're more or less putting him as an expert witness.  You want to solicit his opinion on speeches made by different people, and what is the value of his opinion on those speeches which were made?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, I'm not asking him for his opinion.  I'm asking for him -- his reaction, based on his testimony, that the MRND didn't do enough by virtue of not getting the army involved, not trying to discourage RTLM.  So once I adduce evidence that, in fact, there were some efforts made or there were some reasons why it couldn't be done, I think I'm entitled to ask him to comment on it in light of his previous testimony.  I'm not asking him for a general opinion about the situation.  So, I hope it's of some value to the Trial Chamber.  I guess you'll have to decide that for yourselves.  

So, Mr. President, I would like to have this document admitted as Exhibit D. NZ126.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ126 admitted)  
MR. ROBINSON:
And I would like to ask my legal assistant, Mr. Nsengiyumva, to just read a very brief paragraph.  It's on page K0144453, and it's at the point on that page where the speaker is identified as the minister of defence, and it's listed as 10.6 minutes.  
MR. NSENGIYUMVA:
"Indeed -- indeed, the more the FPR infiltrates into the population, the more the population gets jittery.  And if you see, initially people -- the RPF believed that the population did not love its president, but the proof is that, following the assassination of the president, with the pain, the population was highly indignant and began to react.  

"So we call on the RPF to stop, and this will allow us also, on our part, to pacify and restore calm in the country.  But if the RPF persists in combat, it will be a very difficult task for the government to restore calm."  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Witness T, having heard this portion of the speech made on the 15th -- or, the interview on the 15th of April 1994, and from what you observed on the ground, do you believe that the minister of defence was accurately reflecting the situation, that the Rwandan government was unable to put a stop to the killing because it was fully occupied in the fight against the RPF?  

MR. MORLEY:
This is the point that was being raised by His Honour, Judge Short.  We've been inviting -- my learned friend is inviting what is obviously an expert opinion on an interesting, and perhaps important, aspect of the whole Rwandan conundrum from somebody who is a factual witness.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, this is not an expert who was not there who is reflecting after the events.  This is somebody who was there, who made a lot of observations over the period of time, and he's in a position to give his opinion to the extent that it calls for his opinion based on facts, not based on some review of -- of documents or anything like that.  It's a -- it's maybe his -- maybe his answer will be a compilation of things that can't be expressed, a combination of events that he observed over a period of time.  But, in any event, it's factual, and it's different from an expert opinion.  It's no worse than or different than many speculations that the Prosecution has asked of its witnesses:  "Who was in control of the Interahamwe?" for example.  Well, that -- that calls for a lot of observations over a period of time, not -- I don't object and say "Well, no, you have to tell us some conversation in which you heard somebody say they were in control."  

So I think we're on equal footing here.  And it's a fact witness who observed a lot of facts and should be allowed to answer.  
MR. MORLEY:
The obvious distinction to be made between the witness talking about the Interahamwe and the witness talking about the army is that the witness, for reasons that Your Honour knows -- Your Honours know about, is able to talk about the Interahamwe.  He's a witness who can give evidence of things which the Interahamwe did and how they evolved and so on.  

But he wasn't in the army.  And when my learned friend invites an opinion as wide-ranging as to whether or not the army was unable to assist throughout Rwanda because of these circumstances of fighting the FPR, I respectfully submit it is nonsense to elicit such an opinion from this witness.  He wasn't part of the armed forces and was not in a position to know what capability the armed forces had or how they were acting, which is completely distinct from how he is in a position to give such information about the Interahamwe. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, the way we see it is this, is that if the army was not in a position, there are reasons for it.  If the witness could give that information, then we could draw the inference. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  I can try to ask it that way.  
MR. MORLEY:
I -- I see the force of Your Honour's thinking, but I'm not sure it means that Mr. Robinson can ask this witness for the reasons why the army were in difficulty, given that he has no background in the army.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but he might have factual information which would supply the reasons. 
MR. MORLEY:
Very well, yes -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The issue is what Mr. Robinson is asking the witness to do is to draw the type of conclusion which we should draw.  The -- and we would draw such a conclusion if there was an evidential basis for it.  Now, the witness may or may not be in a position to provide that evidential basis.  And if he can, that's what he will be permitted to do. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes.  It would follow, then, that my learned friend's questions might be, "Were you familiar with the movements and strengths of the Rwandan army?  If so, how did you become familiar with that information?"  

Having established those two things, we can then elicit from the witness what the information was that the witness had.  But what I anticipate my learned friend is going to do is he's going to ask one large, universal question, which will probably be something along the lines of leading the witness to the conclusion which he seeks:  "From your own information would it be right that you know that the Rwandan army was unable to cope with the circumstances in Rwanda?"  

Now, that would be a inappropriate question.  I would invite -- if we're going to go down the road of establishing what knowledge the witness has, we lay foundation for the knowledge first and then elicit it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, there are two ways of looking at this.  You see, a -- a question-and-answer sequence of that nature does not have much probative value.  We are not a jury.  So if that was the only question and only answer on the sequence, it does not have much probative value unless expertise was previously established in the -- on the part of the witness.  So -- so, there are two ways of looking at it, you see.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There's the issue of admissibility and there is the issue of probative value. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes.  My first concern is admissibility.  Admissibility cannot be established without laying foundation.  That is why I suggest the foundation questions.  If the foundation questions are answered positively, then Your Honours have the question of probative value.  But to lump admissibility and probative value together on something as fundamental as whether the armed forces, had they been motivated by the government to do so, could have stopped the killing, I respectfully submit, is too important a question to do that sort of exercise about. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I think I can try to approach this another way.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness T, in your direct examination, you testified that you thought that the MRND leaders could have used their influence to have the army try to stop the killings.  And we see that it was the position of the army that they were unable to do so.  So, could you allow as how it may not have been possible for the MRND to have prevailed upon the army to stop the killings?
MR. MORLEY:
Perhaps I'm being over technical.  I'm not sure it's been established that the army were unable to stop the killings.  My learned friend has put that into his question.  And then, secondly, with regard to what the question was after my learned friend laid within the question two clauses of foundation for what the question would be, my learned friend is effectively suggesting the answer, when the whole point of foundation questions is to establish whether the witness has an answer rather than tell the answer to the witness.  

Perhaps I'm being over technical, but it seems to me that my learned friend has found -- and I use the word "ingenious," and I mean it as a compliment, and I often use it for Mr. Robinson -- another ingenious way of phrasing the same problem in a question.
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, suggesting the answer by cross -- by a cross-examiner is hardly an offence.  In fact, it's supposed -- it's what you're supposed to do. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, that is not -- that is not a material objection.  The objection is this, that you said in your question that "We see that the army was unable to control the situation."  Where do we see that fact?  And you are telling the witness that "We see this fact," and that is, I think, what is the problem. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Perhaps I could say that the army was claiming that they could not stop the -- the killing as we've just heard from the minister of defence in Exhibit D. NZ126.  So if that's all that is the problem, I can rephrase the question and we can go on.  
MR. MORLEY:
What is wrong with simply asking the witness, "What do you know of the strengths and movements of the Rwandan army between April and July of 1994?"  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, I think when Mr. Morley conducts his redirect examination, he's perfectly able to ask that question.  But, in the meantime, I'd like to ask the cross-examination question that I propose.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Witness T, getting back to you, again, I call your attention to the -- your testimony in direct examination, that you thought that the MRND officials should have used their influence to get the army to stop the killings.  And we've seen that at least the minister of defence was claiming that the army was unable to stop the killings.  So I'm asking you, taking account of that, do you believe that it may have been possible for the MRND to have tried to influence the army, yet without success? 
A.	In fact, I thought that -- before being shown this document, even I thought that I had given the content of the messages in respect of the ceasefire.  I had also drawn attention to what we reproached -- that is to say, what would have been efficient had it been -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, sorry, the -- the link -- he -- he should start again. 
THE WITNESS:
Once again, I'm in an evolutionary logic as of the 6th.  We went up to the 11th -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Mr. President, it's -- it's half not there.  It doesn't make sense.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson -- Mr. Robinson, could you stop a minute? 
THE WITNESS:
(Microphones overlapping) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, could you please stop?  

There's been a problem with the interpretation of what you have said.  Would it be possible for you to repeat your answer, please.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Slowly, and without shouting.  
THE WITNESS:
I was saying that it seemed to me that I had, even before -- even before I had -- even before I was shown this document, I said that I had overhaul  (sic) -- overall knowledge of the situation, but I can't say that on such-and-such a day at such-and-such a precise time who had intervened.  

But in relation to a certain -- the polemics between the two belligerents in respect of the negotiations as regards the reproaches as to halting the massacres, and I said that there was a sort of tit for tat, if you don't stop that, we don't stop this.  So, whatever.  And I said that there was an evolution over time.  

And the communiqué or the message from the minister of defence, I realise that in black and white that he spoke on the 15th.  We covered the 6th, the 7th, the 10th, and now we're on the 11th.  Now the situation has evolved.  We are in a situation that is in perpetual mutation.  We are not in a fixed situation, discourses, evolutions evolves -- the discourse evolves with time and context, so I had really already answered the question before even seeing this document.  

Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Thank you, Witness T.  Now, I want to turn to the gendarmerie and the possibility of the gendarmerie being able to stop the killings.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And, Mr. President, at this time I would like to just have the registry distribute an exhibit.  It's in English.  It has not been sent to the location of the witness, but I'm going to ask to offer -- it's a United Nations document.  I'm going to ask to offer this document.  Copy has already been given to the Prosecution.  

Mr. President, at this time I would offer this document as Exhibit D. NZ127.  It is an assessment of the effectiveness of the gendarmerie by the United Nations, contained in a cable from General Dallaire to Maurice Baril at United Nations headquarters in New York -- that's B-A-R-I-L -- and it's dated the 30th of March 1994. 
MR. MORLEY:
Would Your Honours allow me a moment?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, how many language (sic) are you supplying this in? 
MR. ROBINSON:
I only have it in English, which is why it wasn't sent to the witness's location. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, before you say anything else, is there French translation? 
MR. MORLEY:
Not to hand, no.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You're not sure if one exists?  
MR. MORLEY:
We shall find out.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. 
MR. MORLEY:
Give me a moment.  

May I mention, Your Honour, that if you look at the document, it's quite interesting.  There's a lot of handwriting on it.  I'm not sure whose it is.  I would simply ask my learned friend, is that handwriting from the Defence team or is that the way the document appeared to the Defence? 
MR. ROBINSON:
That's the way the document appeared to the Defence. 
JUDGE SHORT:
And also, Mr. Robinson, the document is not signed by anybody.  How do we know about the authenticity of this document?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, the document came to us from the Prosecution, as exhibited by the L-number at the top.  And I believe that the Prosecution obtained this directly from the archives of the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Morley -- Mr. Morley, is that the case?  You -- 
MR. MORLEY:
Yes. 
JUDGE SHORT:
-- accept that this document came from you? 
MR. MORLEY:
This is a document which has come from the OTP from UN archives.  And, as such, this being a United Nations court, I'm not taking any point on its admissibility.  I'm puzzled by the handwriting, but -- because it actually queries quite a lot of the material within the report.  But we'll leave that to one side.  I can see the value of this document to my learned friend.  
MR. ROBINSON:
So, Mr. President, I would ask that it be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ127. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ127 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON:
And I just want to read the conclusion, the last paragraph of the second-to-last page, item number 12, which says that "The gendarmerie is largely ineffective in responding to criminal and politically motivated situations for the reasons outlined above." 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, excuse me.  Could we ask the other end of the link to try and stop the noise?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  

If the people at the location of the witness can please try not to make any noise so that the interpreters can hear what's being read.  You don't have this document there, so if you're looking for it, it won't be fruitful.  

I'm just going to read the conclusion, paragraph 12:  "The gendarmerie is largely ineffective in responding to criminal and politically motivated situations for the reasons outlined above.  The only solution to the problem is to completely rebuild the gendarmerie from the bottom up, as is envisioned in the Arusha peace agreement."  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness T, in addition to the effectiveness, or lack thereof, of the gendarmerie in general as of the 30th of March 1994, is it not also true that the RPF almost immediately attacked the gendarmerie camp in Kigali, putting the gendarmerie directly in the war? 
MR. MORLEY:
Before the witness answers, and again I perhaps am being a little over technical, my learned friend has read the conclusion of a report to the witness.  The report speaks for itself, and Your Honours are able to read it and draw from it the material which is in it.  Having read a conclusion to the witness -- without having established any knowledge on the witness's part with regard to the functioning of the gendarmerie, having read that conclusion, he's now asking a question about an attack by the RPF on a gendarmerie building, I think.  So what was the point of reading the conclusion to the witness?  It wasn't a question.  It seems to have simply been an articulation before the Court, whilst witness is in the stand, of what's in the report.  

I'm just not quite clear how my learned friend is proposing to use this document.  He's laid no foundation, factually, with the witness.  He's read out a conclusion, and he's asking a question of fact which doesn't relate to the conclusion.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I have chosen this occasion as we were speaking of the capabilities of the gendarmerie to offer essentially what is a self-authenticating document, which has no relation to -- particularly to the witness's own knowledge.  And I took the opportunity to read to you the conclusion from the document, which has been admitted into evidence.  And now I'm moving on to another aspect of the difficulties that the gendarmerie would have had in trying to stop the killings in Rwanda.  
MR. MORLEY:
That's helpful and interesting, I respectfully submit.  What my learned friend is saying is that what has happened is, through the introduction of the document, Your Honours have been given some evidence, which my learned friend doesn't seek to test the witness on.  And I respectfully submit that -- and, again, it's a technical point, but these things add up, and they end up causing perhaps some confusion, certainly to me, but perhaps not to Your Honours.  

Secondly, insofar as my learned friend has, therefore, introduced this document as a species of evidence, which he isn't testing with the witness -- can I draw Your Honours' attention to, on the last page, the paragraph above the word "conclusion," which is numbered K, which reads, "When the gendarmerie does react to a situation in force, it is respected.  They appear rugged and are armed with assault rifles.  When they appear, the situation usually pacifies."  

Now, the reason why I've read that is because, if my learned friend is simply reading sections of a document as a species of evidence unconnected to questions of the witness, it seems to me that the entire tenor and texture of the document needs to go before Your Honours.  Now, I stress, I'm conscious of the fact that this is a technical position I'm adopting, but one can see how there may be thought to be some force in what I'm submitting.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. -- Mr. Morley, what counsel says, we don't regard that as evidence.  Now, the document is before us.  The whole document is before us.  And we will be looking at the document, the whole document, in context.  We -- we don't know exactly what weight is going to be attached to it, but all that has happened now is that both yourself and Mr. Robinson have drawn our attention to particular portions of the document, which will assist us, probably, in focusing our reading.  
MR. MORLEY:
Of course, Your Honour, yes.  Will Your Honour allow me a moment?  

Thank you, Your Honour.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness T, turning to you, can you tell us if you're aware that the gendarmerie camp in Kigali was attacked by the RPF sometime in the early stages of the war that resumed on the 6th of April in the evening? 
A.	I subsequently learned that, and in following days.  But all -- at the time itself, all we could hear was shooting, firing, gunfire.  But I did learn of it subsequently in the course of events in Kigali.  
Q.	And were gendarmerie rushed to the war front to assist the army? 
A.	I would like you to repeat your question, Counsel.  I was not paying sufficient attention to grasp its meaning -- your meaning.  I'm sorry.
Q.	Was the gendarmerie rushed to the war front to assist the army? 
A.	From what I know, after 1990, the RPF attack in 1990, within the gendarmerie we learned that there were combat units.  I don't know if that satisfies your -- if that answers your question.  
Q.	Well, were you aware that after the 6th of April members of the gendarmerie were taken to assist -- were -- were requisitioned to assist the army in the fight against the RPF? 
A.	The combat units in question, moreover, I learned that some Interahamwe in Kacyiru had fought alongside the gendarmerie's combat units.  If I recollect well, I think I mentioned that in my statement, answering a question as to whether I -- I had encountered the president of the Interahamwe on one date or another.  But I know that some gendarmerie combat units participated in combat and would go to the front.  As of October 1990, were deployed.  And this being said, and I am not an expert in military matters, but everybody was informed of that, especially in the course of reports on events at the front brought to the knowledge of the population as a whole.  
Q.	Now, in the context of the war that was raging in Kigali from 7 April, let's say, to the 13th of April, if the police were to arrest people, was there anyone there to prosecute them? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We appear to have lost the link.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hometowu, can you hear me?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Yes, Mr. President, I can hear you very well.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We can hear you too.  

Mr. Robinson, could you speak to the witness again?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness T, my question was, if the gendarmerie were able to arrest people for killing, for example, was there any prosecutors there to prosecute them in the period of 6 to 13 April when the war was raging in Kigali? 
A.	The curfew having been established, I think they said only emergency -- emergency services, such as the hospitals or the Red Cross, were exempt from that measure, until the moment when the préfet of Kigali urban préfecture asked the population to reorganise -- for the markets be supplied so that the -- life could proceed normally, who had asked for the removal of wildcat rose (sic) blocks, or the ones that were no longer necessary.  And I think that the judicial apparatus, the investigative units functioned or didn't function, and the call for them to be reactivated followed much later.  

But I personally left -- left the country around the 25th of April, but I don't think -- subject to -- to reservation, I don't know that the call for the public prosecutor's office had not been called for.  They had not been restarted. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"To my knowledge," the witness said. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much, Witness T.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Now, Mr. President, I've come to a point at which I'd like to use some speeches that are -- not yet been admitted into evidence, and, in particular, they're in -- attached to my letter of the 10th of May 2006, and it's number one, a speech of Minister Niyitegeka on the 9th of April 1994; number two, a communiqué of the ministry of interior on the 10th of April 1994; number five, the speech of Minister Niyitegeka on the 30th of April 1994; and, number six, a speech of the minister of justice on the 17th of May 1994.  

And, frankly, Mr. President, my particular -- my -- my main purpose for this is to admit these documents into evidence.  And I can ask questions of them to the witness, but I also can pursue the tactic of not asking questions to the witness of these and having the Trial Chamber evaluate their content or perhaps -- well, to evaluate their content at some point during the trial as a time-saving measure.  So I would like -- the problem is that the documents are in Kinyarwandan -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, Mr. Robinson, there are certain types of evidence, evidential material or documentary evidence, which could easily come in by consent.  Now, I would -- I would have thought that speeches fall in that category.  Now, you have adopted a hard-lined approach on the issue of admitting testimony by consent, but this is an appropriate matter for you to have raised with the Prosecutor.  If there are no objections, then -- and it's an easy matter to deal with.  If there is an objection, then we could isolate what is a legal problem and adjudicate them out. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well, Mr. President.  And I recognise that the Prosecutor has not objected to the admission of speeches, and I expect that that would continue with respect to these, but -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
For example, you said these speeches are in Kinyarwanda. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The -- the transcripts you have. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you explored the issue as to whether there are in existence translations? 
MR. ROBINSON:
I haven't -- other than looking ourselves for the translations among the disclosure, I haven't done anything further than that.  I -- I didn't find translations myself.  But I would like to -- I mean, there's basically two options to proceed here.  We can read the portions that are of interest to the Trial Chamber so that you have now a contemporaneous translation and the translation is part of the record, which would take some time, or the Tribunal Chamber can make an order to the language section that these exhibits be translated before the Trial Chamber commences its deliberations.  

But, obviously, it's of no value to us to tender documents in a language which will never be understood.  So I'm willing to forgo the use of the Trial Chamber's -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do the -- do the Prosecutor know what documents you are referring to now? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, they do.  They've had those documents now since last Friday, and they're -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, are there translations?  
MR. MORLEY:
Well, we've got the documents, but we're expecting them to be used in the course of the cross-examination rather than just lumped in as a group admission without further reference.  

For my own part, I don't know what's in the documents because they're in Kinyarwandan and I'm rather interested to know, if they're used, what's in them.  And the difficulty is that I can't agree to their admissibility until I know what they say.  So it's a bit of a conundrum.  

And Your Honour is right in the spirit -- which I know Your Honour knows I support, particularly -- in the spirit of cooperation between counsel, if we'd been told what was in the documents and could have checked it over the weekend, then perhaps we could have agreed to all these documents.  At the moment I don't know what they're about, and I don't know whether they're relevant.

And I see the -- I see the ever helpful stenographer grimacing at me for speaking too quickly.  

Short point, don't know what's in them, can't agree to admit a thing I don't know about.  There we are. 
MR. WEBSTER:
If I could just offer one additional comment, and it comes back to a point I was making yesterday, Your Honour, there's no secret about these speeches.  I don't see how the Defence has a strategic advantage of waiting until the witness is about to be asked the question before raising -- bringing our attention to the document.  If we could sit down and go through all of the speeches that will be relevant, then the Court will be assisted because what we're concerned about here is finding the facts.  We're not interested in -- in -- in -- in outmanoeuvring the Defence with these documents, and I would presume that Mr. Robinson, as well, is interested in having the witness comment on the content of the entirety of the document.  And we can't do that by reading one sentence or one paragraph into the record for translation and then three-quarters of the document remain in suspense.  We don't know what it is, and then presumably we'll come back to it a year from now when the case is over.  

It does not make any sense to proceed in this manner.  The Court, itself, suggested that the parties get together, go through the exhibits and do some -- you know, make some forward moves on a consensual basis.  I don't know what the problem is.  Every one of these documents originated somehow in the Office of the Prosecutor.  Presumably we know what they are, but, practically, no, we do not.  Even having received these documents two or three days ago, we cannot go through hundreds of pages of things when we don't even know how it's going to fit into the testimony of the witnesses.  It doesn't make sense to proceed in this manner.  

It's not about winning in the adversarial process; it's about putting before this Court the facts of the case and having the witness's testimony be linked directly to the evidence that Mr. Robinson, or either one of the parties, it is trying to move forward with.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I like that speech.  And I like even better when you are the author of it.  
MR. WEBSTER:
The Court seems to suggest that there's some contradiction there, and I have always -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, no, no, no, please.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yeah. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I was trying to be nice.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I think I'll just proceed with the witness, and we will go through each of these speeches and ask questions about them so the Prosecution can understand them.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I'm not certain if I had understood you earlier when you said your main purpose was to have the speeches admitted in testimony rather than to question the witness about the speeches.  Is there any reason why the speeches have to be admitted through this witness, or is -- is there a problem in having other means of having it admitted?  
MR. ROBINSON:
This witness is probably best placed to comment on these speeches.  I think he was following the situation probably more closely than any other witness that will come.  So I think I'm in the -- this especially -- you know that I admitted many, many speeches with Witness G, and, frankly, what happened -- I used the speeches of President Sindikubwabo and the speeches of Prime Minister Kambanda, and the communiqués of the speeches of the MRND with Witness G.  

And after looking through the contents of those speeches and seeing what -- how they went, I asked my team to go and find the speeches by other ministers of the interim government during this same period to see if there were similar calls for stopping of the killing.  And, in fact, those are the six speeches that we've now come up with.  And so my -- my aim is to now find a way to have those six speeches into evidence, and I think that, essentially, are all the speeches, apart from one or two that may arise later, that I'll be actually seeking to offer during the case.  

So now I'm in a position where I have a -- a knowledgeable witness about the discourse that was going on during that time, and I could use this opportunity to admit the speeches through this witness.  But to save time, I was proposing that they just be admitted, translated, and then you could use them later.  But if that can't be done, I'll go ahead and do it like the way we've done it in the past. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just a minute.  

Mr. Webster, we are going to take the recess now.  If the only -- if the objective is really methodology for admission and the documents will be translated at a future stage, it may very well be that you may be able to discuss this with Mr. Robinson and see what the position is.  If there's a bona fide or legal issue, then we will adjudicate it.  If there is no legal objection, then I don't see why the matter cannot be managed in this manner.  

You know, it would be -- seem to be a waste of time, really, just to make the witness read portions of the speech into the record if there is no genuine legal objection for the documents to come into (inaudible).  

So what we'd like to do now is just to rise and see if this matter can be resolved during the  
mid-afternoon recess.  

Mr. Robinson?  Are you able to participate in such a conference? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We rise now.  
(Court recessed from 1554H to 1629H)

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, you can -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  We did have a discussion during the break.  I showed my exhibits -- or, I think the Prosecution has copies of all of them that I wish to admit.  I offered to give them my English summary that I had of the contents, and the bottom line is the Prosecution has informed me they don't want to take any shortcuts.  So we have to proceed.  

So what I'm going to do at this time is take one by one -- I think I could still possibly save us some time, but it's going to take a ruling from the Trial Chamber as opposed to consent from the Prosecution.  

So if I could direct your attention to the first document, which is number one on my letter of 
10 May 2006 -- and I'm going to offer this document as Exhibit D. 128.  And I call the attention of the Trial Chamber to the following:  First of all, the speaker is identified as Éliezer Niyitegeka, the minister of information; and, in fact, we know that from the evidence you've already heard -- and I believe there's an exhibit that lists the ministers of the interim government that Mr. Niyitegeka was indeed the minister of information of the interim government on the 9th of April.  

We see on the top of the page at the right-hand corner a K-number, indicating that the document originates from the Office of the Prosecutor, who has represented to the Trial Chamber earlier that they obtained these broadcasts -- or, transcripts of broadcasts from Radio Rwanda from the Rwandan government after it took power in 1994.  

From the content of the document itself, which is three pages, I'll represent to the Trial Chamber that it indicates that the minister of information and spokesman of the interim government says that there had just been a meeting of the cabinet of the interim government, which had just been sworn in.  And, in fact, I'll represent that on the 9th of April there was such a meeting held.  And they announced that the solution to the Rwandese problem is not to kill each other, and they appealed to the population to stop the killings.  And they also appealed to the RPF to stop the war and to negotiate with the Rwandese government.  

It's my submission that this -- the contents of this speech is similar in tone and content -- well, similar in content to the other speeches that are (sic) already been admitted in evidence around this time, those being the speeches of President Sindikubwabo and Prime Minister Kambanda.  So pursuant to Rule 89(C), I believe there is sufficient indicia of reliability that this document is indeed a speech of the minister of information made on the 9th of April 1994 and broadcast over Radio Rwanda.  And on that basis, I offer this exhibit as D. NZ128.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I'm still objecting on the basis of relevance.  How is this document connected to this witness's cross-examination?  What's the basis on which we're moving this document forward in evidence now during the Prosecution case?  If it's being offered to impeach the witness, or if it's being offered to confront him with a factual allegation that he denies, that's one thing.  Then it would be appropriate.  But at this stage, I don't see how this document is relevant to the process of cross-examining this witness.  

The witness has not even mentioned whether he heard the speech, whether he knows Minister Niyitegeka, so I just don't see how it's connected to what we're trying to do right now.  So the Court can admit it if it finds that it needs to consider this evidence, but it will be admitted over our objection.  There's no translation.  I'm simply relying on what Mr. Robinson's telling me about the content of the speech.  I don't doubt that Mr. Niyitegeka made a speech extolling the virtues of the interim government, but my concern is how does that fit in to what we're trying to accomplish through this witness? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I can answer that by calling your attention to the testimony of the witness, that not enough was done to stop the killing.  And I'm trying to show the efforts that were made to stop the killing.  This is a contemporaneous speech on the 9th of April, so that's the relevance to this witness.  

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are in the position where we find ourselves unable to exercise any discretion at this point in time.  We are going to mark the -- mark the speech for identification and -- and require translations.  We could then evaluate the objection that has been raised.  So we will mark the speech for identification now -- we intend to do that in regard to -- to all the speeches because we are unable to exercise any discretion at this point in time.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So I don't know if you want to go one by one so you can identify them separately -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I'll do that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- and then have them marked for identification.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  The first document, the one we've just been dealing with, the speech of Mr. Niyitegeka on the 9th of April, I would ask that it be marked as ID. NZ16.  The next speech is a actual communiqué from the ministry of interior on the 10th of April.  It's number two in the packet of material submitted to Mr. Hometowu on the 10th of April -- excuse me, on the 10th of May.  And I would ask that that be marked as ID. NZ17.  

The next document is number five in the packet of material that was sent to Mr. Hometowu.  It's a speech of Minister Niyitegeka on the 30th of April 1994.  And I'll mark that as ID. NZ18.  

The last document is actually one that I have to hand out.  I've already given a copy to the Prosecution.  Number six on my list of exhibits to Mr. Hometowu was actually a small summary of the speech of the minister of justice, and that was given on the 17th of May 1994.  But since we sent those materials, we've been able to locate the full text, which I have and will distribute, and ask that that be marked as ID. NZ19. 

And I'd ask the registrar to collect the copies and distribute those of this document.  

So, Mr. President, with those documents being marked for identification, I'll move on to something more productive that we could do with this witness.  I would like to reserve my right to call the -- to recall the witness in the event that the Trial Chamber ultimately rules that some more foundation is necessary for these documents before they can be admitted.  
(Exhibit No. ID. NZ16 marked for identification)

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness T, are you there? 
A.	Yes, I am online, Counsel. 
Q.	Okay.  So, Witness T, I want to apologise to you for all this legal stuff.  It's certainly not your fault.  You're doing an excellent job as a witness, and I apologise that our session has gotten bogged down among the lawyers.  

So I want to turn now to the 12th of April, and -- 
MR. MORLEY:
It's the obvious observation -- I hope I don't have to make it -- Mr. Robinson is very courteous, as always, but I'm not sure his last comments were appropriate. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, I say no more.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness T, moving to the 12th of April 1994, when you -- when -- well, did you learn -- 
A.	I can hear you, Counsel. 
Q.	Did you learn that on the previous evening, the evening of the 11th, the RPF had intensified its attack on Kigali and that the war was even more intense than it had been on the previous days? 
A.	Not only did I hear it, Counsel, but I experienced it personally. 
Q.	And can you tell us what you experienced?  In other words -- 
A.	From the 7th of April, more especially from the 9th and 10th and 11th of April, there was an intensity in the bombings in the high-density neighbourhoods of Kigali, as well as the intensification of military tension.  The population was -- had embarked on an exodus from Kigali. 

I make special reference to the intense bombings throughout the day and which were mostly targeting the neighbourhoods of Nyakabanda, Misikara (sic) -- Kimisigara, as -- and, at the same time, there was an exchange of fire between the opposing forces, initially in Kacyiru, Remera, and in the neighbourhood of the CND where the RPF battalion had been quartered.  

So the bombing rained down on the neighbourhoods near Nyakabanda, Gisagara, Remera, and all those areas near Mount Rubero.  
Q.	And, nevertheless, did you and some other members of the Interahamwe committee embark upon the tour on the morning of the 12th that you had committed to undertake? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, that is correct. 
Q.	And how many members of the Interahamwe committee went on the morning of the 12th on this tour? 
A.	Number nine, number eight, number six.  Numbers five and seven had excused themselves and, therefore, did not take part in the tour of the 12th.  
Q.	And could you tell us where on the 12th the three members of the national committee went to -- and what happened at those locations? 
A.	The tour attempted to cover the neighbourhoods that had not been visited, namely, in the vicinity of Kabasingwe neighbourhood, Kinamba, the neighbourhood of Rugenge, what was formerly called le péage.  They covered the area near the neighbourhoods on the border between Kacyiro, Gikondo, and then we went up via the Hotel Kiyovu neighbourhood, and we headed towards the Diplomat Hotel.  

In fact, at a point in time, we were panicking by the magnitude of movements by the population, which was moving out of Kigali en masse, exiting Kigali on their way to Gitarama. 
Q.	And what was the reaction of the population to the message that you were delivering, that the killings were to stop, the bodies were to be collected, and that anyone who did not obey these orders would receive the sanction from the interim government? 
A.	People were getting more and more nervous, and we, ourselves, were beginning to wonder how effective the message was in the face of events.  I remember that around the péage there -- who almost took us aside to say, "Look, you're asking us to stop tracking down the enemy, whereas even Mr. Théoneste Gafaranga has been identified as being on the side of the enemy." 

All we did was say to him -- relay the message from the authority that he should conform or face sanction, that is to say, that the message was not getting through at all, given the intensity of the military conflict, movements of the population.  We knew that we were preaching -- we could feel that we were preaching in the desert.  

At any rate, we began to doubt the efficacy of the message, the request that had been made to us.  And, indeed, I must add that people were saying, "Rather than ask this government to arm us, provide us weapons, we have been asked to fold -- cross our arms and do nothing."  
Q.	And given the timing of the RPF's intensified attack, as you returned to the Diplomat Hotel, had you come to the conclusion that it was not feasible to continue your mission any longer? 
A.	Counsel, given what we were witnessing, we, ourselves, were afraid and rushed to our families.  But, on the other hand, imagine our dismay -- our disappointment when we arrived at the Diplomat Hotel and learnt that the government had moved.  We said to each other, "We've been betrayed by those in whom we had placed our trust."  
Q.	Can you tell us approximately what time of day you arrived at the Diplomat Hotel on the 12th? 
A.	Counsel, I reckon it was about 2 p.m., 2:30, perhaps 1:30.  That is the time range I can give you.  At any rate, it was early in the afternoon, I know.  So I would place it between 2 and 2:30, or even 1:30 when we noticed that the government had moved.  
Q.	And can you tell us what happened as you drove up to the Diplomat Hotel?  How did you find out that the government had moved?  And then tell us the circumstances leading up to the -- your encounter with Mr. Nzirorera.  
A.	In fact, we found that Mr. Nzirorera was at the Diplomat Hotel, and he confirmed to us that even he was supposed to have moved away, and that served as a report, as a concern that we expressed to him.  We told him that we had relayed the message as per their request.  We told them that the government would deal with the issues, and now in the face of the reluctance that had been articulated by a number of people, the government having left, we were now left exposed.  How would we deal with people who we had asked to put down arms?  How were we to make them understand that the promises we had made to them -- how were we going to explain to them that now, having asked these people to put down their weapons, we were exposing ourselves to harm?  

And Mr. Nzirorera understood that, indeed, these concerns were real.  Yes, in fact, we had been thrown into the mouth of the wolf, and they had left without even telling us.  Fortunately, we found Mr. Nzirorera in that place.  Personally, I can tell you now, today, that if that had not happened, I would have concluded that perhaps even this government was in the pay of the RPF.  
Q.	Can you tell us where it was that you encountered Mr. Nzirorera?  Was it inside the hotel?  Was it in the parking lot? 
A.	Counsel, the question you are putting to me is impossible to answer.  You may ask me what vehicle he was using, but, for me, what really mattered is the fact that Mr. Nzirorera was still at the hotel and that we were able to speak to him, as I have just described.  I think he can give you confirmation of this.  
Q.	Yes, he can.  And, in fact, it's his recollection that you met in the parking lot.  

And were you aware that Mr. Nzirorera himself showed up at that Hotel Diplomat to meet with you and had not been informed that the government had left? 
A.	Counsel, I really do not have such details.  But what I did remember is that he said, "Unfortunately, I, too, will move away --" 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Alas," rather. 
THE WITNESS:
I do not know the circumstances of the move, although I do know that it was following military pressure by the RPF, RPF which intended to capture the hotel.  But that, of course, I came to know subsequently.  However, at the time, unaware as I was, and given my disappointment, I did not understand.  But, indeed, there was enough military pressure, and they were in the possession of certain information that we did not have.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And did you tell Mr. Nzirorera that, given the state of the war, it was imperative that the people receive weapons so that they could defend themselves? 
A.	Counsel, not in the way you describe.  If you want me to -- I can repeat what I've always stated:  The government had given us a message.  We were reporting it in such a way as to ask the population to calm down and telling them that the -- that the government would look into their problem.  As for the details you are asking for, I'm sorry, I'm not in a position to give you those. 
Q.	Well, do you recall the conversation you had with Mr. Nzirorera as it related to weapons? 
A.	In conclusion, in fact, in describing the problems we faced, which were real problems, Mr. Nzirorera told us, in conclusion -- he gave us a telephone number and asked us to call him no later than 4 p.m. and that he would tell us what we should do.  And that is how we separated.  

At about 4 -- around 3:30, I called Mr. Nzirorera's house, and he told me that he had encountered another problem and that at 6 we should go to meet Colonel Bagosora at the Diplomat Hotel, which we did.  Indeed, this was most fortunate because the military escort that had accompanied us told us that they belonged to his guard.  And so there was some familiarity that settled in -- in our relations, so that when I called (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under separate cover) -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says witness. 
THE WITNESS:
-- when I called the person mentioned at item six -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping) yes, the name is redacted. 
THE WITNESS:
He told me that he had also contacted.  And so we met at about 6 p.m. at the Hotel Diplomat.  That is how I bid Mr. Nzirorera farewell at the Diplomat Hotel.  

I believe I met him next at on around -- on the -- on the 18th or 19th in Murambi. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I -- I order the redaction of the name that was mentioned.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness T, I want to put to you a difference in recollection that Mr. Nzirorera has with your account of these events.  And I -- it's Mr. Nzirorera's recollection that, when he met you at the Diplomat Hotel on the 12th, that indeed you presented the problem to him about the people who had requested weapons.  And it's his recollection that at that time he referred you to the ministry of defence and that he thereafter went back to the place where he was staying, gathered all of his family and others in their convoy, and that they left Kigali towards Gitarama, ultimately arriving in Ruhengeri in the evening of the 12th, and that he could not have had any of these phone conversations with either you or (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under separate cover) because by that time -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Oh, sorry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The name is again redacted. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q. He -- he could not have had these conversations with you and -- excuse me.  

MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I think there was a problem in the French translation, so I'm going to have to start that question over again.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness T, I'm telling you that there's a difference of recollection between your events, as you describe them, of the 12th and those of Mr. Nzirorera.  And so I'm putting to you the recollection that Mr. Nzirorera has to give you an opportunity to comment on them.  

And it's our position that, indeed, you met Mr. Nzirorera on the 12th at the Diplomat Hotel, as you've testified to, and that you presented to him the problem of the people at the neighbourhoods requesting weapons.  It's his recollection that he referred you at that time, not later, but at that time, to the ministry of defence and that he thereupon hurried back to the house where he was staying, he gathered his family and others who were with him, and they left immediately towards Gitarama, ultimately arriving that evening in Ruhengeri, and that he could not have had the conversations with you on the telephone or with number six because in the afternoon he was on the road towards Ruhengeri.  

So that's his recollection of those events, and I wonder if you would like to comment on that.  
A.	Counsel, I have no comment to make on that.  I gave you the two version (sic) that I experienced.  If Mr. Nzirorera tells you that he sent me to the ministry of defence, I never met the minister of defence at that time.  I don't see how I could be referred to the minister of defence, whom I had not met. 

He might have sent us also to the chief of general staff or anyone else, but I gave you the version -- a version of the facts that I experienced, I lived through.  And I'm not trying to invent a story, and I don't see any comment I have to make on that. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  I'm going to ask you now about how you actually acquired the weapons on the evening of the 12th.  Can you tell us, beginning when you were at your home, what your movements were? 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I'm on my feet at this stage.  I'm very grateful to my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, for putting so clearly the difference in recollection as it was put between the witness and Mr. Nzirorera.  And it seems plain from the cross-examination, ably conducted in respect of the entire circumstances surrounding the pacification tour, that from the questions Mr. Nzirorera was present on the 10th of April, on the 11th of April, and on the 12th of April. 

In addition, from the questions which were put, it is plain that my learned friend has challenged the presence of Karemera on the 10th of April, but not his presence on the 11th of April.  And, of course, Your Honours will be aware that, having challenged the presence of Karemera on the 10th of April, at no stage has my learned friend challenged the presence of Ngirumpatse on the 10th of April or the 11th of April.  
So I'm on my feet at this stage to draw the Court's attention to what appears to be the presentation of the Defence case for Nzirorera, that Ngirumpatse was present on the 10th and 11th of April; that Karemera was present on the 11th of April; and that Nzirorera was present on the 10th, 11th, and 12th of April.  

Now, if I state the position incorrectly, then no doubt my learned friend will wish to challenge the witness as to the presence of Ngirumpatse on the 10th and 11th of April and/or the presence of Karemera on the 11th of April.  But at the moment that's how things stand after what has been a thorough cross-examination in which various people's cases have been touched on by my learned friend and, notably, have not been touched on.  Absences have not been suggested in respect of certain dates.  
(Pages 30 to 54 by Ann Burum)

























1700H 
MR. ROBINSON: 
You know, Mr. President, that is a very unhelpful observation by Mr. Morley; and, in fact, it is not even accurate.  You have limited it up to -- by time -- you have imposed time limits on the examination of these witnesses and I'm not intending to cover all of other people's situations or -- I'm selecting what is important in my cross-examination.  And if something is left out, that doesn't mean we are admitting it.  

I know Mr. Morley wants to make his job easier every time he can, but we are not conceding anything by the failure to ask a question.  And if I put a portion of my case to the witness that is to help you in evaluating what I perceive to be a potential conflict and, perhaps, a credibility question you will have to examine.  But if we don't put something to a witness, it doesn't mean that we concede it or it advances the Prosecution's case in any way.  So I don't think that what Mr. Morley has said assists any of us and, in fact, it confuses and misleads the issue. 
MR. MORLEY:
No, my learned friend has specifically challenged the presence of Karemera on the 10th of April.  And one may be forgiven for assuming that, therefore, if he doesn`t challenge the presence of Ngirumpatse on the 10th and 11th, and doesn't challenge the presence of Karemera on the 11th, and throughout his cross-examination has made it plain that Nzirorera was present on the 10th, the 11th and the 12th, it would follow that the presentation of the Defence case for Mr. Nzirorera, Mr. Nzirorera instructing my learned friend, it would follow that Karemera was present on the 11th; and that Ngirumpatse was present on the 10th and the 11th, because there was a challenge of the presence of Karemera on the 10th.  Now, if that is wrong, it may be appropriate for the position to be clarified.  

And it would be particularly appropriate for the position to be clarified to the witness, because at the moment the only challenge to presence has been of Karemera on the 10th of April.  And if the reality is there is a challenge to the presence of Ngirumpatse on the 10th and 11th, and Karemera on the 11th, then that ought to be put to the witness so that Your Honours can properly assess the witness`s credibility of the witness and the presentation of the defence, in respect of this critical meeting -- or series of meetings.  

So if my learned friend stands up and says, "Oh, Mr. Morley wants his job done better," no, I just seek for Your Honours` assistance, clarity as to what precisely is being put and not put.  On the face of it, one could be forgiven for assuming, and it would be a proper assumption, that if he challenges Karemera's presence on the 10th and not the 11th, Karemera was there; because Nzirorera was there on the 10th, 11th and 12th, according to the cross-examination.  And if he doesn't challenge the presence of Ngirumpatse, Ngirumpatse was there as well. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, that speech is -- would be more appropriately timed at a later stage of the proceedings. 
MR. MORLEY:
Well, Your Honours -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you must recall that we are affected by the presumption of innocence here.  The Defence doesn't have to prove anything, and neither can I demand that they show their hand at this stage.  

The issues you have raised go, in the long run, to what is persuasive, what do we believe, what is the weight of the testimony at the end of the day.  But I don't think that we can make any orders requiring the Accused to put forward their case. 
MR. MORLEY:
Two thoughts, if I may offer them; the first is, this small little invitation to Your Honour is not a matter of persuasion, it is a matter of what is being put to the witness.  And on the face of it, it seems plain if there is a challenge to a presence on one date, it follows that where there isn't a challenge, then when the witness has said that the three defendants were present on the 11th and there is no challenge to that, but there was a challenge in respect to the 10th, Your Honours may find yourself in the happy position of discovering that so far as the defence of Nzirorera is concerned, there is no dispute between the Prosecution and the Defence about the presence of certain people on certain dates.  

So, it is not really a matter of persuasion.  It is a matter of what is in dispute, where is the conflict, and allowing the witness an opportunity to tell Your Honours to what extent the witness is clear about his recollection, because if he is not challenged about the presence of Ngirumpatse on the 10th and 11th, and the presence of Karemera on the 11th, then I respectfully submit he is being put at a disadvantage, and so are Your Honours, with regard to his credibility and reliability.  Your Honours are entitled to ask my learned friend whether or not this is something that ought to be challenged.  And Your Honours are entitled to make the observation that if it isn't challenged, and it is subsequently said that the -- that Karemera was not present on the 11th, and Ngirumpatse was not present on the 10th and 11th, if that is subsequently said by Mr. Robinson, Your Honours would be able to approach what is said against the background that it was never challenged. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, with regard to Karemera and Ngirumpatse, I should draw your attention that Mr. Robinson is not representing them.  They have their own counsel.  And, in fact, I'm very glad for the opportunity to make this comment, because over the last couple of days there have been a couple of incidents which have shown that the -- oh, I see Mr. Sow is on his feet, I better not make his speech for him.  Nevertheless, I think that the Court should make the point that Karemera and Ngirumpatse are being separately represented, and their legal teams have equal status before our court. 
MR. MORLEY:
Of course, Your Honour, yes.  And one is always sensitive to that.  But insofar as there is a presentation of Nzirorera's recollection as to what was going on on the 10th, 11th and 12th April, he, Nzirorera, is able to say, through his counsel through questions put, whether the other defendants were present or not.  I mean, that is the reality of the multi-handed trial.  Just because people are separately represented does not mean that each defendant cannot speak -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, could you please try and moderate a bit the speed, sorry, sorry, a request from the French booth. 
MR. MORLEY:
Just because they are separately represented does not mean that Mr. Nzirorera cannot, through his Counsel's questions, put whether the co-defendants were present at certain events.  And as             Your Honours know, there was a specific challenge in respect of Karemera on the 10th of April. 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I consider that our very dear friend, Mr. Morley, has made an inappropriate intervention.  He has -- he tends too much to reduce the Defence to Mr. Peter Robinson.  We will have our opportunity to undertake our cross-examination, and in any case, he can always re-examine.  So why is he making us lose so much time?  I really feel that his intervention is inappropriate.  Let him leave us, the Defence, to organise ourselves as we see best fit to serve the interests of our clients, and he should not speak in our stead.  Thank you. 
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President, it is my turn to say something on behalf of Mr. Ngirumpatse because, indeed, we have not begun our cross-examination.  At the appropriate time, we shall make -- put the questions we feel have to be put, and Mr. Morley will be able to make the comments he feels he needs to make.  But you will have noted that since the start, we did not make any objections in the course of the examination-in-chief by the Prosecution.  But since Monday, and already on Friday afternoon,            Mr. Morley bombarded the Defence in undertaking its cross-examination with objections, which explains why we are in a very difficult position in defending our client.  I find it surprising that every question put by the Defence should be the subject of a torrent -- torrential torrent of objections by the Prosecution because Mr. Morley is constantly obstructing, it would appear to us, which is why I am speaking, that Mr. Morley is systematically objecting. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if I could just add, truthfully, I simply left the matter of Mr. Karemera's presence on the 11th to Mr. Sow as a way of allocating time, and trying to use my time.  I could have put to this witness that it is our position that Mr. Karemera was not present on the 11th, but just I decided to leave that to Mr. Sow.  And any time that we don't make a challenge, doesn't mean that we are somehow providing evidence against our co-accused, or making admissions on behalf of the co-accused, whether it be our case or not.  
I do say that I don't believe that Mr. Morley is obstructing by making these objections.  I personally feel he is fond of the sound of his own voice, but I don't believe he is being obstructive, and I hope we can move on to something more productive.  I have to say that I have to revise my estimate as to when I will close my examination as a result of the time we lost this afternoon.  I don't think I will finish at least probably to the end of the day tomorrow, but I hope that we can move on.  Thank you. 
MR. MORLEY:
Well, hesitating -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, it is not necessary to comment on this any more.  
MR. MORLEY:
It is interesting that my learned friend has just put forward that he challenges the presence of Karemera on the 11th -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley -- 
MR. MORLEY:
But nothing about Ngirumpatse. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, I think we have exhausted this subject. 
MR. MORLEY:
Very well, Your Honour. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness T, turning to you, probably this discussion has confirmed that it was a wise choice for you not to pursue a law career.  In any event, let's get back to the facts and to the evening of the                   12th of April 1994.  Can you tell us what your movements were from your home to obtain the weapons that were obtained that day? 
A.	Counsel, after we left Mr. Nzirorera, I went home.  I returned to the Hôtel Diplomat at about --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness first said 4 p.m. 
THE WITNESS:
No, I'm sorry, that is a mistake.  I returned -- that was (French spoken) we returned at 6 p.m. where we met Mr. -- Colonel Bagosora; whereupon we went to the Ministry of Defence, where he telephoned someone.  And he gave us his driver as a guide.  And we went as far as the building where we were -- took delivery of the load of weapons.  So, I will continue with my timetable.  It was about 7 p.m. by then, and we were -- Mr. Kajuga joined us at about 7:30. 

I'm sorry; I think there were two or three people with us, most probably two.  And when we took delivery of the load at about 8 p.m. the team that accompanied number 1, consisting of number 6, 8 and 9, went off to my place where we stored some of the weapons.  And then we went on to Gitega with the rest of the weapons expecting to distribute them on the next day.  In the meantime, number 1 and his team joined us in Gitega where we exchanged the views and news as to the situation, because it was the first time that we saw number 2 and certain other people.

After which at about 9:30, 10 p.m., in the company of number 8, I went to my family because we ourselves were concerned with evacuating our families, which we did in the morning of the following day.  That is how -- that is what I would say about my schedule in the evening of that day, after our meeting with Nzirorera at about 2:30 p.m. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness T; that was very comprehensive.  Now, when you were discussing with the other members of the national committee who had obtained arms, when you were discussing the day's events, what was the discussion concerning the government having left on that day? 
A.	Counsel Robinson, our conversations -- our discussions were not on the basis of a given agenda or at a given time of day.  Our exchange of news was in respect of the events -- on the basis of what one or the other saw, or one or the other observed.  So our discussions, as those of all Rwandans at the time, were about the events.  What did you do on the 7th?  Where were you?  We were looking for the pacification meeting.  

So our conversations, discussions were on various events.  The war, the whole context, and allow me to say so, I don't know if I can give you a report day-by-day, hour-by-hour of the discussions held with one person or the other.  I'm quite simply incapable of doing so.  

Thank you. 
Q.	Can you tell us what was the attitude of the members of the Interahamwe committee about the government having left on the morning of the 12th of April? 
A.	Well, I have told you what the attitude was; we felt we had been betrayed.  We thought people don't even believe the messages we're asked to pass on.  And then they scarper at the first shot of a gun.  Don't ask me to tell you everything that was said, most particularly on the -- a lot was said about the war.  And the way the government ran away on the 12th was not -- could not be a subject of pride on the behalf of the government.  To leave is understandable, but to leave without saying anything, without making an announcement over the radio, don't ask me to speak of the attitude, my attitude, my colleagues' attitude in the face of the irresponsibility of that government. 
Q.	So, I take it that the government had lost the respect of the national committee of the Interahamwe by having left on the 12th; is that fair to say? 
A.	In fleeing, without alerting anyone, warning -- and what they would take the same measures, put yourself in the shoes of a population who has just seen a government instituted to ensure their security.  In fact, you cannot imagine what was going on -- going on at that time in Kigali which is, perhaps, the reason why you are putting questions the way you are putting them. 
Q.	Why didn't you yourself leave Kigali on the 12th of April when you saw that the government had left? 
A.	Counsel, I did not leave on the 12th because, first of all, I didn't feel I should leave on the 12th of April in view of the conditions I was under.  I had to organise my own family's departure first.  

And since you want to know, we felt that we should, first of all -- we should, first of all, do the right thing by the people to whom we had carried a message, and who had given us a message in return to take to the government; and we wanted to show them that we had not abandoned them.  On the contrary, we had done what we had promised to do.  But when the time came, I did leave; and in any case, I -- until the month of June, I to and froed between Gitarama and Kigali because I felt that I had the duties to perform, whether ideologically or professionally, due to the war.  It wasn't after the first gunshot that I felt I should leave Kigali, especially in view of the situation in which the government had put us.  

Thank you for your question, Counsel. 
Q.	Okay, thank you for your answer, Witness T.  Now, turning to the next day, the 13th of April, did, in fact, you participate in the distribution of the weapons that had been obtained on the 12th? 
A.	Exactly, absolutely, and to gain time.  Let me explain that after having evacuated my family, in fact, the evening before we had arranged to meet in Gitega, to be precise, in the context of our discussions with other people, especially number 1, who we hadn't seen since then.  He told us that he would be   present -- he wouldn't -- he would not be present at the distribution of weapons, but would be -- would be rather going around the roadblocks because he had a role to play, vis-à-vis his people, to show that the committee had not abandoned the Interahamwe za MRND in Kigali.  So, at about, later on -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I missed the time.  
THE WITNESS:
We went to Gitega.  And it was, in fact, very simple.  We followed the same itinerary, which is the same as that which we followed, and we issued the weapons.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can we stop the witness for a minute, please?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness, could you give us one more moment; there is something that the Bench needs to discuss.  We will tell you when you can resume. 
THE WITNESS:
I understand. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I hope that your reaction to Mr. Morley that suggested that you were going to sort of double the remaining time of your cross-examination was just a reaction.  We have two decisions that we wanted to deliver this afternoon.  And we are thinking of asking you to end your cross-examination today a bit earlier, as soon as possible, to facilitate that process.  But we wouldn't want it to create problems, other problems. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
No. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
In terms of time. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, it won't create any problems.  I think -- by my estimation we lost about two hours today with objections and legal issues and trying to get the speeches authenticated, and so I think I'm not going to go slower or change anything from my pattern, but I think that as a result of those two hours will probably spill my examination into the afternoon; but I am not taking any revenge on Mr. Morley or anything like that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, so when you come to a convenient time. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
This is a convenient time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, can you hear me now?   I think that it is necessary --  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I hear you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We think it is desirable to end your examination for the day at this stage.  There are some legal matters that the Chamber needs to attend to and we would like to use the remaining 20 minutes before our close at 6 o'clock in dealing with them.  So we are going to excuse you now.  I remind you that you are not to discuss the case during this or any other adjournment.  And your testimony will resume tomorrow morning.  So you may leave now. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  Have a good evening, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.
(Witness exited courtroom) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Do we have a written text for the decisions?  Excuse me, just asking. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, we will rise for five minutes.  We will resume in about five minutes time. 
(Court recessed from 1743H to 1759H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have two decisions we would like to deliver.  The first decision is a draft oral decision on oral motion pursuant to Rules 66(B) and 68(A) for disclosure of information from Joseph Serugendo.  

The Chamber is now going to rule on Nzirorera's oral application of 22nd May 2006 for the disclosure of information from Joseph Serugendo.  The Defence for Nzirorera submits that the information sought is both exculpatory under Rules 68(A) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence and is material to the preparation of his defence, pursuant to Rule 66(B) of the rules.  The Defence commits that the information is necessary for the purposes of its cross-examination of Witness T, in particular because both Serugendo and Witness T were members of the same national committee and were amongst the founders of RTLM.  The Defence further submits that Serugendo was present on 10th April 1994 when it is alleged that Nzirorera directed the Interahamwe committee to stop killings, an event to which -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It appears the problem has been resolved, says the French booth. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I am told that there was a microphone overlap.  I will read the last two sentences.  

The Defence further submits that Serugendo was present on 10th April 1994 when, it is alleged, Nzirorera directed the Interahamwe committee to stop killings, an event in relation to which Witness T also testifies.  The Defence submits that if it does not have access to the Serugendo material now, Witness T may need to be recalled.

The Prosecution opposed the Defence motion, submitting that it is not in possession of any information from Serugendo which falls within the scope of either Rules 66 or 68.  The Prosecution submits that it has nothing in its possession to disclose since it has not, as yet, taken a "formalised" statement from Serugendo.  It further submits that it intends to take a statement from him, at which point it will be disclosed to the Defence under Rule 66(A) of the rules.  The Prosecution today advised the Chamber that it does intend to make an application to vary its witness list by adding Joseph Serugendo to it.

Rule 68 of the rules sets out the Prosecution's disclosure obligations in relation to exculpatory and other relevant material.  Sub-Rule A places a duty upon the Prosecutor to disclose to the Defence any material which, in his actual knowledge, may suggest the innocence or mitigate the guilt of the accused or affect the credibility of Prosecution evidence.

According to the jurisprudence of this Tribunal, for the Defence to establish that the Prosecution has breached it disclosure obligations under Rule 68(A), the Defence must:

a.	firstly, identify the material sought with the requisite specificity; 
b.	secondly, make a prima facie showing of the Prosecution's custody or control of the materials requested; and 
c. 	thirdly, make a prima facie showing of the exculpatory or potential exculpatory nature of the materials requested.

Information which contradicts that provided by a Prosecution witness is exculpatory within the meaning of Rule 68.

With regard to the first and second criteria concerning the Prosecution's possession of material which is identified with sufficient specificity, the Chamber is of the view that whilst the Prosecution's submissions on this issue have been ambiguous, the criteria have been satisfied.  It can be established from the Prosecution's submissions that there is material in his office's possession, which has been reviewed by him, and which he has determined not to be exculpatory.  A combination of the Prosecution's submissions, as well as its indication that it intends to add Serugendo to its witness list, makes it clear to the Chamber that the Prosecution is in possession of information concerning this individual.

The Chamber notes its concern that the Prosecution would consider the Defence's intention to call an individual as a witness -- expressed during the early stages of the Prosecution's case -- as in some way relieving it of its obligations to disclose materials under Rule 66 and/or 68.  Rules 66 and 68 outline the Prosecution's obligations to disclose material falling within the ambit of those rules.  Such obligations can in no way be limited by an expression of intention, by the Defence, to call an individual as a witness.  

Turning to the third criterion requiring the Defence to make a prima facie showing of the exculpatory or potential exculpatory character of the materials requested, the Chamber is also of the view that this criterion has been satistifed.  Serugendo's alleged presence on 10th April 1994 when Nzirorera claims to have directed the Interahamwe committee to stop killings, is potentially exculpatory in that Serugendo may support this Defence assertion.  As Witness T also testifies to this event, the Chamber considers it important for Nzirorera to have access to all information concerning this event in the Prosecution's possession, for the purpose of properly conducting his cross-examination of Witness T.  Furthermore, the Chamber considers that exculpatory or potentially exculpatory material should be disclosed irrespective of whether it is contained in a statement --  in statement form or not.

The Chamber is therefore of the view that the Defence's application for disclosure of information from Serugendo should be granted in part, and hereby orders, pursuant to Rule 68(A), that the Prosecution disclose, prior to the completion of Mr. Robinson's cross-examination of Witness T, to the Defence of all of the Accused any information it may have from Serugendo concerning the allegation that Nzirorera directed the Interahamwe committee to stop killings on 10th April 1994, since such information is important for the Defence's cross-examination of Witness T.

The Chamber notes, however, that if the provision of material pursuant to this Order does not allow Mr. Robinson an adequate opportunity to review it prior to the close of his cross-examination, the Chamber will afford him a further opportunity to question the witness upon the subject matter of the material disclosed pursuant to this order.

Finally, the Chamber notes that any application to add Serugendo to the Prosecution witness list should be made forthwith, and any statements taken from Serugendo should be disclosed under Rule 66(A) as soon as possible.

Now, the second decision that we have is an oral decision on Nzirorera's application for reconsideration of the Trial Chamber's decision of 15th of February 2006.  

Last week, the Defence for Joseph Nzirorera moved the Chamber to reconsider its decision of          15th February 2006 concerning the withholding of certain material regarding Witness T provided to the Prosecution by a State.  It submitted three main arguments:  

1. Since Witness T's trial is not scheduled to commence in any time in the near future, the prospect of the Defence obtaining these materials later, in which Defence could then review whether or not  Witness T should be recalled before the trial is ended is significantly diminished; 

2. Since Witness T is prepared to accept his responsibility for the charges that are laid against him, the material would not jeopardise his right to a fair trial; and 
3. The Defence for Nzirorera finally referred to the Chamber's decision on a motion to compel inspection and disclosure of 5th July 2005, where the Chamber found that the identity of 13 witnesses regarding Witness T should be disclosed to the Defence in accordance with the Prosecutor's obligation under Rule 68 of the rules.

The Defence for Karemera further claimed that the "summary" of Witness T's statement provided by the Prosecution does not allow understanding the content of these statements.  It submits that the State has not communicated any restriction with respect to the disclosure made by the Prosecution and that in doing so the Prosecution substitutes itself to the Chamber.  The Defence for Ngirumpatse finally requested the disclosure of the Witness T "proces-verbaux" in a redacted form and not as a summary as done by the Prosecution.

The Prosecution opposed the various Defence submissions.

As already stated in prior decisions, the Chamber has an inherent power to reconsider its own decisions when a new fact has been discovered that was not known to the Chamber at the time it made that decision, or there has been a material change in the circumstances since it made its original decision, or there is reason to believe that its original decision was erroneous or constituted an abuse of power on the part of the Chamber, resulting in injustice thereby warranting the exceptional remedy of reconsideration.

In the present case, the Chamber is of the view that none of these conditions is met.  The expected date of Witness T's trial in the State does not constitute a new fact warranting a reconsideration of the Chamber's decision of 15th February 2005.  In that decision, the Chamber carefully balanced the rights of the Accused with those of Witness T to receive fair trials in their respective criminal proceedings.  The Chamber has also noted that extensive disclosures were already made with respect to this witness.  Furthermore, it appears that the Defence already knows the main content of the statements 
(for instance, the fact that the witness lied when he sought asylum).  The Defence is in a position to cross-examine and challenge the witness's credibility.  In that respect, however, it is noteworthy that the Defence for Nzirorera explicitly stated in open court that Witness T was highly credible.

The guilty plea of the witness does no more affect the prior Chamber's finding.  Even if the witness admits his responsibility for the charges pleaded against him, he is entitled to a fair trial in the State.  As already stated in the decision sought to be reconsidered, the full disclosure of the material considered may affect his rights.  The situation has not changed.  Finally, the present request is distinguishable from the situation dealt with in the prior Chamber's motion to compel inspection and disclosure.  In the present situation, the statements in respect of which unredacted disclosure is sought are statements made by witnesses in the proceedings before the state.  They are not Prosecution witnesses.  And, contrary to Karemera's assertion, the authorities of the State made explicit submissions in that regard.  They expressed the view that a suggestion made by the Prosecution in its applications under           Rule 66(C) of 26 September 2005 for partial disclosure of Witness T's judicial records will satisfy both their obligation to cooperate with the Tribunal and to protect its own security interests.  They conclude that due to, among other things, security reasons, the documents contained in Witness T's judicial record can only be partially disclosed to the Defence.  And see paragraph 11 of the Chamber's decision of 15th of February 2006.  Accordingly, the Chamber permitted the Prosecution to disclose in part Witness T's statements.  In the same decision and in order to preserve the right of Witness T to a fair trial and the public interests of the State, the Chamber authorised the Prosecution to maintain the redaction of Witness T's statement taken on 29th September 2005 (served in edited form on the Defence on 7th October 2005).  And see paragraph 24 of the decision.

The situation has not changed.  There is no ground for reconsideration of the Chamber's decision of 15th February 2006.

However, the Chamber agrees with the Defence that a summary is very different from a redaction of a statement.  A summary extracted may present a distorted content of the statement and does not allow an assessment of how it had been redacted.  In the present case, the Chamber never authorised the Prosecution to disclose summaries to the Defence.  It only permitted the Prosecution to redact some statements made by Witness T insofar as it may be contrary to the public interest of the State and it could disclose confidential information.

The Chamber therefore denies the motion for reconsideration of the decision of 15th February 2006; but orders the Prosecution to disclose within 48 hours to the Defence of all of the Accused, Witness T's statements, which were disclosed as summaries, in a redacted form so that protected information on the whereabouts of Witness T be not disclosed (in accordance with the Chamber's order of 10th December 2004) and the identifying information of witnesses called to testify in Witness T's trial be not disclosed.

Those are the decisions that we have to deliver. 
MR. MORLEY:
I'm conscious of the hour, Your Honours, but it may be there's been a misunderstanding about the document which Your Honours will recall was the subject of the argument last Wednesday.  Although it was referred to as a summary, Your Honours may recall that that was corrected by Mr. Sow, who pointed out that it wasn't a summary, it was a series of excerpts from the statements; in other words, it was a presentation of the redaction, a presentation of the material which was disclosable within the statements.

It was a series of excerpts; it wasn't a summary, and although the observation is made in the judgement which Your Honours have just read that a summary may distort, of course, the nature of material within a statement, I had thought -- and maybe my learned friends had thought as well -- that it was clear to Your Honours that it wasn't actually an excerpt document which I had wrongly referred to as a summary.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, that was not clear to us.  It was your side of the table who described it as a summary.  What I understood Mr. Sow to have been saying was that it was not a complete document because he noticed, for example, that there was a paragraph 1 and then a paragraph 3, so that sections of the document were omitted.  So his suggestion was that there were -- selected parts of the document were retyped.  
MR. MORLEY:
Yeah. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So that was the basis of our factual statement, the statements made by yourself and by Mr. Sow.  We, of course, have not had an opportunity to look at these documents and make any independent assessment of them. 
MR. MORLEY:
The document was before Your Honour on Friday.  As part --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but we have not seen what it came from, so we cannot really testify as to whether it is just a series of excerpts or -- you know, we can't --  we have to accept somebody's statements, and our judgement was based on what you had said and what Mr. Sow had said. 
MR. MORLEY:
Of course, all of the material was filed with Your Honours --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but we can't look at it.  You can't expect us to review it ourselves. 
MR. MORLEY:
The only reason I am on my feet is because from Your Honours' order, what is being sought is what my learned friend's have, namely, the material which was discloseable after redaction.  And what has happened is that it has all been put on one document as quotes, or excerpts, to use Mr. Sow's description, from the statements.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, then there should not be a difficult complying with our order. 

MR. MORLEY:
What I am suggesting is I think we have complied with the order. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, I don't think that this really is or should be a controversial matter.  The Prosecutor sells redacted statements all of the time.  This is the very first time I have known that a document has been retyped in order to give effect to an order for redaction.  So we would prefer that you use the normal procedure and black out the portions to be redacted. 
MR. MORLEY:
Very well, Your Honour.  All it will mean is the same material --
MR. PRESIDENT:
So it won't be difficult. 
MR. MORLEY:
Okay, thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you.

Yes, Mr. Sow.  
MR. SOW: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I merely wanted to confirm what you said. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm now going to behave like the interpreters:  You spoke too fast for me. 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I thought you spoke French, or at least understood French. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
When spoken slowly. 
MR. SOW: 
Agreed.  So, Mr. President, I wanted to confirm that what you said is quite exactly what I said last time.  Instead of using the normal procedure, Mr. Morley was content to extract bits of the PV, and that is why there is one paragraph 1 and paragraph 3, and paragraph 2 had disappeared.  The document is no longer coherent or logical. So he should take -- use the same method of blacking out, of redacting, so that we see the intrinsic nature of the document, even if parts are obliterated.  Thank you, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  I think that we have run out of time, and I think we have completed our business for this afternoon.  We take the adjournment now and resume tomorrow.
