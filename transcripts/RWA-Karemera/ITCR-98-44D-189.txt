P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please?
MR. HOMETOWU:  
	Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, and Judge Vagn Joensen is now sitting in closed session, today, 28th of October 2008, for a status conference in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No.  ICTR-98-44-T. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Could we have appearances, please? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Good morning, Your Honours, good morning to the parties and the registry, the interpreters.  The Prosecution is represented by myself, Don Webster.  We also have Alayne Frankson-Wallace, Iain Morley, Saidou N'dow, Gerda Visser, Takeh Sendze, and the record should also reflect other members of our team, Upendra Baghel, and two interns that will be assisting us for this session, Jonathan Campion and Linda Gambone.  Once again, good morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, once again, and thank you.  

Yes, Mr. Sow.  
MR. SOW: 
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Good morning to members of the Office of the Prosecutor.  Good morning, learned friends.  And good morning to everybody.  

Mr. President, I am Moussa Félix Sow, co-counsel for Mr. Édouard Karemera, assisted by Ms. Fatou Ndour, legal assistant, and Mr. Bernard Munyanziza, who is our investigator.  

Ms. Diagne is not in attendance, as you know, Mr. President.  And I would like to use this opportunity to thank you, and all members of the Tribunal, and the parties, for your messages of encouragement and solidarity that you have addressed to her.  
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much, Mr. Sow.  And I think it would be appropriate for me to put on the record that the Chamber expresses its condolences to her in her time of bereavement. 
MR. SOW: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I would like to address my respects to you and the entire Chamber.  I am Frédéric Weyl, co-counsel for Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  I have here beside me Marina Yetongnon, our assistant.  Mrs. Hounkpatin is not with us today.  

And without waiting for the proceedings, I would like to mention two things to the Chamber:  First, to thank the Chamber for its understanding in the scheduling of this hearing.  I would like to say that, as in the case of Mr. Sow, I had a lot of trouble coming to Arusha yesterday.  I got here at noon, after beating a record that I thought was impossible, in all goals.  I spent 39 hours to move from Kigali to Paris.  Yesterday, I spent 39 hours 45 minutes from Paris to Arusha, and, in spite of all of my efforts, I could not be here before noon.  

The second point I wanted to raise is that I've been authorised -- I've been given a message for the Chamber by Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  He has asked me to thank all of those who in this Chamber addressed him messages of speedy recovery through me, and I am being a faithful messenger of Ngirumpatse to address to all those present here his thanks and gratitude for your show of concern.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. NIMY: 
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.  My name is José Patrick Nimy Mayidika Ngimbi, lawyer, counsel for Mr. Nzirorera present here.  I also have here beside me our investigator, Mr. Daniel Ntawumenmunsi and we have our intern, Ms. Yaël Vias.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much, Mr. Nimy.  

Now I would have to specifically invite the registry -- who requested to attend this morning -- to present information this morning concerning the health issue of Matthew Ngirumpatse.  If they can kindly make their appearances, please? 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. President, may I say that I am the deputy registrar and I come at your invitation to present the health situation.  I am accompanied by Dr. Marie Epée-Hernandez. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. O'Donnell. 

Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I am sorry to be up on my feet to address a concern to the Chamber.  And I hope the Chamber will not hold this against me.  

Now, we are in closed session.  Maybe it is an extension of what was decided last Monday, when the Chamber decided that the session would be a closed one.  It is a double problem for me -- a problem of principle -- but I'm ready to live with that.  But I don't think that the issues that we are supposed to discuss, if we stay within the limit of what we are supposed to understand, I do not think it will require a closed session.  I think we could equally discuss these issues in open session.  

And the second issue I would like to raise with the Chamber is that if we have this closed session, we are setting a trap for ourselves, in the future, with regard to any of our reflection, because in none of future hearings when we have to discuss the proceedings, the conduct of the proceedings, we will not be able to refer to what we would have discussed today.  And today's closed session is a trap for future proceedings, because it closes the proceedings in a confidentiality that may be binding on us, and this also raises the conditions of a closed session.  

In my opinion, we could have today's proceedings in open session on condition that each person should know how to censor themselves and avoid issues that would go beyond what is necessary to enlighten the Tribunal.  And, that way, we could continue to have our reflection rooted in what we establish today.  But, if we proceed in closed session, it would be impossible for us, subsequently, to raise issues that we may have discussed today.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. WEBSTER:  
	Your Honours, my understanding is that we were doing this in closed session actually to protect Mr. Ngirumpatse.  And I would urge the Court to continue in closed session.  If, at the conclusion of our status conference, Mr. Weyl feels that nothing that was said compromises his client, then, the Chamber could always decide to unseal the transcript.  But for the purposes of going forward, I think, we are on much safer ground simply addressing these issues in closed session, which is something the Court itself suggested the last time when we were in court together.  So that is our position.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, we think there are two separate issues:  One, the information which Dr. Epée will provide, and the discussion about it.  We think that the information from Dr. Epée should not be available to the public.  And, so, we think that that should remain in closed session, and the issue in terms of how counsel develops it, as we discuss it, we can have that discussion in open session.  And counsel will have to know how to use information appropriately.  

So we think we will have the first part of our session in closed session.  And then we will go into open session for any discussion that we might have arising from information that is provided.  Okay.  Thank you.  

Mr. O'Donnell, we think we should invite you to determine the method by which you would like to present the information, on behalf of the registrar, which we requested.  So I would now ask you take the stand -- to take the floor, sorry, not the stand.  
MR. O'DONNELL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I'm grateful that you don't want me to take the stand.  I have never done so in my professional career.  

In the light of the fact that we are, broadly speaking, going to hear from the doctor in closed session, and that you have expressed a desire that argument and conclusions may be ventilated further in open session, it would be my proposal now to call Dr. Epée-Hernandez to give evidence on oath, before I address you any further. 

Dr. Epée-Hernandez, would you be kind enough to move into the witness box and be sworn, please? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Registrar, unless there is any special objection from counsel, we would like to, as a courtesy, to waive the giving of an oath at this stage.  If counsel wishes to put questions to Dr. Epée, they can address it through the Bench, and we can direct you to ask -- 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. President, I am obliged at the honour extended to Dr. Epée-Hernandez in her professional capacity.  It's probably not an honour that would ever be extended to a lawyer.  
MARIE-FRANÇOISE EPÉE-HERNANDEZ
BY MR. O'DONNELL:
Q.	Your name is -- would you like to be seated?
MR. O'DONNELL: 
	May the witness be seated? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. 
BY MR. O'DONNELL:
Q.	Is your name Dr. Marie Epée-Hernandez? 
A.	Yes.  I'm Dr. Epée-Hernandez, Marie-Françoise.  
Q.	What is your official title in this institution? 
A.	I am the chief medical officer of the ICTR. 
Q.	And your professional address, therefore, is ICTR, Arusha, Tanzania? 
A.	ICTR, Arusha, Tanzania.  
Q.	Would you prefer to give your evidence in French or English? 
A.	I would prefer to use French. 
Q.	Thank you.  I'd like to refer you now to the detainee, Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Do you have before you his medical file?
A.	Yes, of course I have it. 
Q.	I would like to refer, in the broadest terms, to his condition.  I do not intend to invite you to state, even in closed session, what the diagnosis is.  If others wish to ask you that question, then they may do so.  

First, the fact of the timing of his condition:  Is it the case that this is a longstanding condition? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Since approximately when has this condition affected Mr. Ngirumpatse? 
A.	From the 16th to 17th August. 
Q.	Of 2008? 
A.	Of 2008. 
Q.	But prior to that, is this a prior longstanding condition dating back some years? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Approximately when was the first time that this disease manifested itself, before this year? 
A.	Before 2008, no symptoms were discovered.  But he stated he had been ill since 1976. 
Q.	In approximately 1979, in the town of Hamburg, did he receive any treatment for this condition? 
A.	Yes, he stated that he received treatment, but he has no documents to establish that.  Neither did he present results thereof. 
Q.	Now, I come forward to the time that you have already referred to, August of this year.  Can you inform the Court what the first symptoms were that came to your notice? 
A.	I --
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, with your leave.  I am a bit lost in this scenario.  I do not understand it.  I don't know whether we are in the context of an examination on all the past acts, the entire medical history, or the health status of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and to transform it into a dispute and open arguments on what is true or false or proximate thereto, or we are simply here in the character of a status conference where we expect the authorised medical officer who is known to all of us, to tell us three things?

First, is Mathieu Ngirumpatse really unavoidably absent on account of health reasons, yes or no?  Secondly, what is the probable predictable duration of that unavailability?  And, three, at the end of that period during which he will be unavailable what, medically speaking, could be the possibility for Mathieu Ngirumpatse to recover and come to the Tribunal?  That is it, Mr. President.  

After that -- after saying all that, Dr. Epée would have done her duty as a medical officer.  And, we, as a Chamber, could look at the consequences in terms of the procedure so that we can learn from all of this.  But, now, I do not understand how the registrar here seated is investigating into the causes of Ngirumpatse's illness and all of that.  I don't understand what it has to do in the proceedings.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I would like to thank Patrick Nimy for what he has said.  He got up to speak at the point when I was also hesitating whether to stand up to speak or not, because at some point in the past I have always been the black sheep who has expressed his feelings with a lot of conviction in terms that may hurt people.  

So I would like to thank Patrick Nimy to have been the faithful interpreter for what I actually felt coming up in me.  And I would like to add an argument, a point.  Already, the registrar is placing Dr. Epée in a rather uncomfortable situation because he's asking her to report statements that had been made to her or that were allegedly made to her by Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  And he is already placing her in a tight spot by asking her to report facts that are protected by the privileged client-physician relationship. 

So, not only do I subscribe entirely to what Mr. Nimy has said, but I may add that we are still running the risk of asking Dr. Epée to violate her oath.  Not the oath she took here, but the Hippocratic Oath, that is, to respect the right of her patient to confidentiality of medical records.  So I'm asking the Chamber for -- a closed session -- not -- for information that may not appear on the records or statements between Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Dr. Epée on his medical history that are way out of our proceedings.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I would like to back the motion made by Mr. Nimy so we can gain time. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, we simply point to defer to the deputy registrar.  He, I assume, knows how he wants to present the information that the medical service has.  And I simply -- we have no objection.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  Mr. Webster should be very pleased that today we agree with him.  And we will allow the registrar to continue.  I don't think that anything has been asked or said up until now, which would violate any rules of confidentiality or breach any professional obligations that Dr. Epée has had.  
MR. O'DONNELL: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. O'DONNELL:
Q.	Dr. Epée, to continue, when this matter was brought to your attention; from what you understand, had this been the first occurrence or did it antedate your knowledge of it by some days? 
A.	Let me assure everyone I will maintain confidentiality.  But I was called upon on the 17th during the course of the day.  I was not in Arusha.  But I instructed the nurse to do her best to take the patient to the hospital.  Given that the complaint that she had received was serious, Mr. Ngirumpatse was taken to the hospital.  And this is what we call "hospital" in inverted commas.  It's a small clinic.  

And there we found that Mr. Ngirumpatse's condition was serious.  So serious that we needed to take all measures immediately before we transfer him wherever.  And that is what happened.  Subsequently, obviously, I was to learn that Mr. Ngirumpatse had some complaint.  That was a week, but we believed that everything was going to be all right.  That's what I can say. 
Q.	On the first situation he was taken to the AAR clinic, and after that transferred to the KCMC in Moshi; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So does it follow from that he was hospitalised without delay? 
A.	As far as we can say, no, without any delay.  The matter is simply -- 
Q.	Thank you.  That is all I want.  

Now, how long did he stay at KCMC? 
A.	He remained there from the 18th August to the 5th of September. 
Q.	And during that time, did he undergo tests and did he receive treatment? 
A.	Of course.  The same day, and the treatment continued throughout the time he was there. 
Q.	Now, you made a report to the Court in which you said that he would not be available to come to court for a minimum of a month; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What did you refer to, to come to that judgement?  Is there such a document as the medical disability adviser?  Tell the Court about that, please. 
A.	Each illness has a limited duration of disability or rest required or absence.  With regard to Mr. Mathieu, when we were seeing him at KCMC, maybe it was after the last operation that he needed to have rest of 14 to 21 days.  I extended it to one month, to be sure that he was really indeed able to come back to court. 
Q.	So, what day did he leave KCMC to come back to Arusha, please? 
A.	On the 5th of September. 
Q.	And at that time, what was his condition as far as you were concerned? 
A.	He was on his way to recovery.  He was partially recovered. 
Q.	And did you tell Mr. Ngirumpatse what further steps you would take at that time? 
A.	Yes, I did.  I discussed with him at KCMC that I would do everything so that further tests be done on him.  Obviously, I didn't give him specific dates because I did not have those in hand. 
Q.	And where did you intend to do those tests? 
A.	In Nairobi, as we do for the staff members.
Q.	And, when, finally, did you transfer him to Nairobi? 
A.	After all measures taken, he was transferred on the 8th of October; 2008, of course. 
Q.	And I will ask you about one matter in the light of various filings made on behalf of his counsel, referring to delays at this time.  May I refer you to a letter dated the 8th of September 2008 from Mr. Ngirumpatse?  Are you aware of a letter which says:  "First of all, I wish to thank you for the devotion and your solicitude shown by you throughout my illness, since the 17th of August 2008 up until today.  I also wish to express my gratitude to all your colleagues who have been very devoted in looking after me."  Do you remember that letter? 
A.	Yes, I have it. 
Q.	Thank you.  
A.	Yes, I have it.  It is dated.  I received it on the 9th of September. 
Q.	In Nairobi, did he undergo further tests? 
A.	Yes, of course.  He had to undergo many. 
Q.	As a result of the tests conducted in Nairobi, are you in a position now to inform this Court about his prognosis, in broad terms? 
A.	Yes.  His prognosis which is reserved, not only for the time being -- 
Q.	"Reserved" is one of those medical terms which perhaps means a great deal to doctors, but may not mean a great deal to others.  

If I were to use the English -- 
MR. O'DONNELL:
	I see Mr. Weyl is on his feet yet again.  I will pause.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, once again.  I did not think that this would be the essential objective of our discussions this morning, that we would need to look into the past.  But it seems that we're going to have the discussion that the registry wishes us to have.  But the last question asked by Mr. O'Donnell raises an ethical issue for me.  

I had mentioned this earlier, before the hearing.  And I repeat it:  Mathieu Ngirumpatse is not an object.  It is not acceptable to push the discussion in the direction to which Mr. O'Donnell wants to go in matters which are rather private and concern Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse -- doing so in his absence and making him an object of a discussion.  

And when he will read the transcripts of this closed session, I believe that -- we know Dr. Epée said what she said.  I don't think we should be indecent.  We -- I don't think it is appropriate, in our discussion, to go into an epistemological analysis of the term "reserved prognosis" in the absence of the person in question who, at his hospital bed, will be reading the transcripts of what happened in this closed session.  

I think that Dr. Epée has said what she needed to say, and in terms in which everyone can understand.  And that it is not appropriate to extrapolate, to discuss and dissect her words. 

So I would like that we remain there -- as I had requested before we began this hearing -- remaining there, obviously, with that particular point.  
MR. O'DONNELL: 
I don't know if you wish to hear from me, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will hear you, Mr. O'Donnell.  
MR. O'DONNELL: 
At the time, about five minutes ago, when Mr. Weyl was the black sheep and he had a counsel in front of him representing his emotions, I think we were told what we needed was a prognosis.  That was what was said by the learned counsel in the front row.  And we are attempting now to establish what the prognosis is.  Otherwise, how can this Court know how to proceed?  

We are not referring to the nature of the illness.  We are not referring to any of the details, but this Court, presumably, does need to know what the prognosis is in broad terms.  The term "réservé" leaves us nowhere, and leaves you nowhere, and then we might as well not have had this status conference. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. O'Donnell.  

You may continue.  The doctor may answer the question.  
BY MR. O'DONNELL:  
Q.	The term "réservé", can this also be translated as "guarded"?  Is that something that you and I have discussed in the past? 
A.	Discussed with you?  I don't quite understand.  
Q.	All right.  Let me move on.  
As far as the future is concerned, the position of Mr. Ngirumpatse, will it change in the next six months? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Is his present condition likely to improve? 
A.	Medicine has done miracles.  That is a possibility. 
Q.	During the present time and in the next six months, is Mr. Ngirumpatse in a fit condition to attend these court proceedings? 
A.	No.  No, not at all. 
Q.	Can you explain what it is that his present condition does to prevent him taking part in these proceedings? 
A.	His health status simply doesn't allow him to come to court. 
Q.	Without naming what the medication is, does he receive a regular form of medication in Nairobi? 
A.	Yes.  He is receiving regular treatment which happens once a week. 
Q.	And when he receives that treatment what is its effect upon him? 
A.	Like many medications, side effects are quite significant in this case. 
Q.	Can you give us an example?  Does it keep him in bed?  Does it confine him to his bed? 
A.	Yes.  He has to remain in bed.  He cannot get up.  He has to rest. 
Q.	And the rest of time -- and I bear in mind there have been other cases in other tribunals where arrangements have been made to accommodate sequential periods of illness.  So, I'm going to ask you about the period of time after he has had the medication, after he has been in bed for one or two days.  In the rest of the week, can he concentrate under his present treatment regime? 
A.	With the treatment he's receiving now, after seven days -- or two days which are very tiring, he remains tired.  He can be awake for one hour or two, or he can be up for an hour or two, but he cannot sustain anything that lasts for several hours. 
Q.	And since this was raised in the course of pleadings by his counsel, I'm going to ask you one other question.  If he was transferred to any other hospital in any other place, such as Europe, would his treatment be any different? 
A.	It would be the same treatment he would receive anywhere. 
	(Pages 1 to 10 by Eleanor Bastian)










1100H
BY MR. O'DONNELL: 
Q.	Is the treatment he is receiving in Nairobi the best treatment available in the region? 
A.	Of course. 
Q.	Is he going to have to stay in Nairobi for the next six months?  
A.	As far as I'm concerned, yes.  We do not have any such similar facilities, medical facilities which can take care of him, as far as I'm concerned. 
Q.	And that refers -- when you say we don't have the facilities that means in Tanzania? 
A.	I'm speaking of Arusha and the surrounding area.  I'm not talking about Moshi, which is the referring area. 
Q.	Could he be treated for this condition in the same way with the same success in Moshi? 
A.	No, not at all.  Moshi does not have the facilities for such treatment.  
MR. O'DONNELL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I have got no other questions.  I'll leave the doctor for further questions from the Bench. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. O'Donnell.  

Yes, Mr. Nimy.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I'm on my feet simply because I want to go to the second-but-last question put by Mr. O'Donnell on the possibility of better treatment, and he himself mentioned the area Europe.  I'm somewhat saddened in the way in which Dr. Epée, whom I respect a great deal, responded to this question; throughout he would receive the same kind of treatment.  Mr. President, I would say no because I myself was in a similar -- it's important, Mr. President, if you allow me to finish.  I do not know what Dr. Epée knows specifically on Mr. Ngirumpatse, but I know that the technological abilities or capabilities existing today in Europe are enormous.  

I was in Nairobi myself when I was ill last year and I almost had my head opened up without knowing what was in it.  And I don't know whether, if it was closed up again, I don't know what would have happened.  So I went to Europe and I told them about the episode and I went -- they were not understanding anything I was saying.  

Yes, please go ahead, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, at this stage, even though, if you wish, you may have an opportunity to give evidence in due course, it's of great interest at this time to hear what Dr. Epée has to say.  So if you could sort of confirm -- transform your comments into a question, I could then put it to Dr. Epée so she could respond.  
MR. NIMY: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I shall put the following question to Mr. -- to Dr. Epée. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	What does she understand by -- what was not being able to be done in Nairobi and Moshi, could not be done in Europe? 
A.	I don't know whether Mr. Nimy was listening to me.  I said that the treatment was not possible to be done in Moshi because the product does not exist.  And yet, in Nairobi, the product exists, the medical product exists and the treatment is being done.  That is all I said. 
MR. NIMY: 
I'm sorry, Mr. President.  The answer given by Dr. Epée is comprehensive, but it is not responding to the aspect raised by Mr. O'Donnell regarding transfer elsewhere, other than Nairobi. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, I would just like Mr. Nimy to complete his question, first, before I hear you.  

Mr. Nimy, did you wish to put a follow-up question?  
MR. NIMY: 
I am done for the time being, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Nimy.  

Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, at this point in time I would like to thank Dr. Epée for the light she had shed for us on this matter.  And I wish to tell her if this response to questions that we had -- because we didn't have any answers to our questions -- but the answers which have been given to us during this hearing this morning consist in the beginnings of answers to our questions.  And I thank her, as I was able to thank a moment ago, on behalf of Mr. Ngirumpatse, those who had expressed their sympathy to him.  On behalf of Mr. Ngirumpatse, I wish to thank Dr. Epée for her devotion in this matter.

I wish to raise a few matters that have been brought up by the initial answers given.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	If I understand Dr. Epée well, it's not envisioned that Mr. Ngirumpatse receives medication at UNDF, that is not possible.  
A.	Not at all.  And it is not possible that he receives it in Arusha, not so.  Not in Moshi, not so either.  
Q.	He can receive such treatment, however, in Nairobi.  
A.	Yes, and he is in the process of so doing. 
Q.	The status of Mr. Ngirumpatse, is it compatible with continuous hospitalisation, be it some days spent in Moshi, or the days which he's already spent in Nairobi, is it -- can if be envisioned that Mr. Ngirumpatse will remain permanently in hospital without being exposed to the risks that we know? 
A.	I would say that that is not desirable, that he be hospitalised for six months or to one year.  He -- if we go beyond six months, we would have to go to one year.  But I cannot do that because I myself cannot offer him the same treatment here in Arusha. 
Q.	Dr. Epée, do you think that Mr. Ngirumpatse's condition would be compatible with comings and goings between the UNDF and Nairobi?  For him to receive the treatment from Nairobi and then after that treatment, would it be possible to organise medical follow-up in his cell at the UNDF? 
A.	Mr. Ngirumpatse cannot make the trips from Nairobi to -- Nairobi and back.  He goes and receives the treatment --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
	I'm sorry.  I missed all of that because she was a bit fast, Mr. President.  If she could repeat that? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
          Please.  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I was saying -- let me repeat.  The treatment that he has, he needs to go into hospital on one day, the following day he receives treatment, he's not well throughout that day, and probably the next day he's not well at all.  If he has to be brought back to Arusha, he would have to spend three days in Nairobi, on the fourth day he would take the road, and the sixth day he would have to take the road back again to Nairobi, and that is mathematically and physically impossible. 

If you allow me, let me add one thing.  If it is -- if it were a staff member, I would have evacuated that staff member for six months.  That is allowed in the staff rules.  And I don't know why this should be an exception for any other human being. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
May I raise some concerns?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Questions of Dr. Epée or about -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'll hear Mr. Sow first.  Mr. Weyl, I take it you have completed your enquiry?  
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, I believe so, Mr. President.  Dr. Epée has answered all the questions which I had concerning the future.  And I thank her for her sincerity and the transparency with which she gave her answers and in a very clear manner for the benefit of the Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Yes, Mr. Sow.  
MR. SOW: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I wish to ask Dr. Epée two questions. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Dr. Epée, you spoke of the unavailability, at least for six months, of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  I want to ask you, by leave of the Presiding Judge, his incapacitation that you're referring to, would that be while the doctor is being -- is the doctor treating Mr. Ngirumpatse of the same opinion as yourself? 
A.	Yes, of course.  And he has put that in writing.
Q.	My second question, Dr. Epée, is this:  You stated that science does know of miracles being done.  And would it be reasonable to believe or think that at the end of three months, that it may be possible to be able to better appreciate the treatment received, for us to determine whether there will be an improvement or a worsening of the condition? 
A.	In the present condition of our knowledge, at the end of three months no specific evaluation can be done.  One can do a provisional evaluation.  So I would not be able to say that after three months you'll be able to know definitively what his condition would be.  So I'm insisting on this word "provisional" or "intermediary" evaluation or assessment.
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I had said two questions, but the answer is requiring a further question.  This is why I am asking this question, for clarification. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Dr. Epée, can you tell us, when we will do a step-by-step evaluation or an intermediary assessment, as I had said, at the end of three months, would it be possible to know the condition in terms of its development or its progression? 
A.	I cannot predict what will happen in three months.  I know that the treatment will have an effect on the patient, but I do not know what his condition will be in three months time.  I cannot say anything in that regard. 
Q.	I'm not asking you, Dr. Epée, to make any predictions, but I'm asking you, because the interest of an intermediary assessment or evaluation should enable us to know what the situation will be.  At that point in time, at the end of three months, if an assessment is done, will we be able to have a diagnosis of his medical situation, be it positive or negative? 
A.	Mr. Sow, you already have a diagnosis.  It is there.  This patient is there with a diagnosis.  We have said, the panel of doctors has made an assessment, and we said that Mr. Ngirumpatse is unable to take up his normal activities.  And we have said for a minimum time of six months.  We can even go to one year.  But this is all I can say.  I'm afraid I cannot say any more.  
Q.	I thank you, Doctor, but my intention was not to have you say anything other than what you have said.  
MR. SOW:
I thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Sow.  

Yes, Mr. Webster.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	For the most part, the other attorneys have asked questions that were of interest to us.  My main concern is whether there's any hope of Mr. Ngirumpatse recovering, making a full recovery.  So I would like to know from the doctor if, given other cases that she's had of this nature, what is the likelihood of the patient, Mr. Ngirumpatse, making a full recovery, whether that's after six months or after a year?  Or is this simply a means of maintaining him?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone to the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Microphone, Dr. Epée.  
THE WITNESS: 
I beg your pardon.  In the present status I have some reservations.  I'm sorry for not being able to provide you with a firm and specific answer.  If you wish, Mr. President, I can explain.  The same treatment given to two people will give a different result, depending on each individual's constitution, physical constitution.  This is why I have reservations in expressing myself further. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	I can appreciate that, Doctor, and I also wish to be sensitive to Mr. Ngirumpatse, who will be reading these transcripts later.  But our concern is really beyond the issue of how we deal with this trial, but any future trial that Mr. Ngirumpatse may face by himself.

Based on your observations and your familiarity with his -- this condition, is it a consideration that you would have at this time that he may not be able to assist in his defence at all?  In other words, is there a -- I'm trying to get some sense from you of -- if there's any prospect of him recovering to the point at which he can actually participate in a trial, based on what you know now? 
A.	Before the next six months I'm not sure that Mr. Ngirumpatse will be able to come back to this courtroom and work with you.  After the assessment at six months, I may possibly be able to submit a report which would enable the Chamber to make its own assessment.  But on the basis of -- but I said that this would probably be something between six months and one year.  So, I'm saying I do not know what can happen between this period of six months to one year.  And he cannot appear before this Chamber before that six-month period is over. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Donnell, did you wish to put anything further to Dr. Epée? 
MR. O'DONNELL:
No, Mr. President.  I think she's answered as fully as she is able to professionally. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  And the Chamber, we do not have any questions either.  

Dr. Epée, we thank you very much and we would be obliged if you could retake your seat at the table you occupied before.  
MR. O'DONNELL:
Well, Mr. President, she may wish to go and heal the sick, rather than listen to us.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  If there's an objection, I can -- I don't know if anybody wishes her to stay longer?  

In the absence of any comments, Dr. Epée, you're excused and you may return to your clinic.  Thank you very much.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you very much. 
(Witness excused) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, we think we can go into open session now.  

Actually, before you do that, Mr. Sow, you had raised some questions earlier about the availability or the management of witnesses that you're calling in defence of Édouard Karemera.  And we thought that as we decide how to move forward, it might be useful to have the witnesses give an indication of the matters which you have expressed.  Maybe it may be appropriate to have it in closed session before we discuss in open court.  Would that be -- suit your convenience?  
MR. SOW: 
Yes, Mr. President, since these are protected witnesses. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Registrar, I would suppose, should we -- we should go back into closed session and I would allow the registry to bring the witnesses forward one by one so we could make the appropriate enquiry. 

	(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 18 to 35] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
 (Pages 11 to 17 by Janice Dickman)



































MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  It's 12:30 now.  We will -- we received communication from all counsel expressing a desire for time to respond to the information which was provided by Dr. Epée.  Now her information has been given, would we be in a position to discuss it this afternoon or would we have to give some time? 

As far as the Chamber is concerned, we think that there are the two issues.  The first one has to do with the effect of the evidence as to Mathieu Ngirumpatse's health.  Does that require us to sever him from this case and stay his proceedings until his health is better, or is there some other way of proceeding?  So we wish to hear counsel on that.  

Secondly, with regard to the witnesses for Édouard Karemera, how do we address the problem? 

We were in -- we consider Mr. Sow's proposal for the use of Rule 71.  We, ourselves, have enough time to take depositions ourselves.  So if it is we have the consent of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, we could facilitate the presentation of Édouard Karemera's defence by taking those witnesses ourselves, under Rule 71.  

Those are the two issues that we think we need to hear.  And if you are able to address them immediately, we could resume this afternoon.  But if you need more time and you indicate, we will decide when is the earliest time we could hear these matters -- hear you on these matters.  

I suppose, Mr. Weyl, we have to ask you first.  Would you be ready to proceed this afternoon or do you need some more time? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I must say that I am still under the shock of what I heard this morning.  And I still raise the question I raised this morning.  

We have a technical difficulty.  How can we discuss anything at this point on the basis of information collected in closed session?  That is the first difficulty that has to be cleared.  Because we cannot refer to any of the issues that were discussed this morning, except we have to make them confidential.  So that is the first difficulty I am raising again.  

The second is that, in my opinion, we actually need written submissions; we have always said so.  And at this stage my written submissions would be very simple, subject to the consultations I will have with the lead counsel of Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  And the written submissions will necessarily generate -- will trigger a response from the other parties and the Prosecution.  And it is on the basis of such responses that I would continue to carry out consultations.  
And so maybe the Chamber may decide some other procedure other than submissions and status conferences.  Maybe a procedure of exchanging written submissions or filings between the parties to discuss how we can proceed on the basis of what we heard this morning.  But I'm afraid that if we adopt -- we will decide to proceed by this oral procedure, we will not get very far.  

So maybe the Chamber should set some scheduling with regard to the exchange of filings.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, why do counsel need an order to exchange information between each other?  We've all been in court this morning.  We've heard the testimony.  Counsel can confer and exchange information immediately this afternoon.  I don't think counsel need an order from the Court to be able to speak to each other and to share information.  

I would imagine that time is of the essence.  Everybody has seen this coming for some time.  Everybody had the opportunity to make their own inquiries, to the extent that they wished to do so.  

I think that we should try to resolve this within the next couple of days.  Now, I take the point that it probably would be reasonable to give a couple of days to digest the specific information that 
Dr. Epée has provided.  But I don't see why counsel can't exchange submissions among themselves and be ready to have final argument on this matter on Monday -- Monday of next week.  

So if I was going to be -- if I was called upon to make a suggestion, I would say that one should be ready to argue this matter on Monday the 3rd of November, after having exchanged submissions prior to that.  

Why would that be inconvenient for you? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, if I refer to your conclusion, it would maybe tie in with what I suggested to the Chamber; that we exchange filings and have a discussion on such filings, maybe.  But if the Chamber believes that the 3rd of November is a sufficient date, then subject to what my learned friends would say, I will go with it.  But maybe it would be better to work more conveniently following a schedule than later on hold a hearing and hear the observations or the submissions of the parties in support of their filings.  

The date you've suggested to me is workable, subject to the observations of my learned friends.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Mr. Karemera -- Mr. Sow? 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, effectively, I believe that it is indispensable for the parties to consult, in addition to the filings that may be presented to the Chamber.  

It being understood, as you know, that my lead counsel is taken up somehow elsewhere.  That is why I think that if we give ourselves some time up until the 3rd of November, we may have time to have prepared our submissions.  And also, when there are submissions from all the parties, each party would like to respond to the submissions of the other.  So I don't know if the 3rd of November is very convenient.  Today is the 28th, if I remember correctly.  I don't know whether that date of the 3rd is reasonable.  

At any rate, we need some time frame to submit our submissions and discuss them.  

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Ngimbi.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, at this stage.  Honestly, I can only tell you one thing.  I am going to discuss this with Mr. Nzirorera, and especially with the lead counsel, Peter Robinson.  Then, together, we will decide on the best course to adopt in this matter.  I cannot say any further at this stage.  

We will consult -- I'll consult the lead counsel and Mr. Nzirorera.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Webster? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  I'll begin by mentioning, just for the record, that we do have some indication of Mr. Robinson's position on this.  

There was an email exchanged yesterday.  And I believe part of it, or if not the entire correspondence, was circulated officially through CMS.  And what I recall Mr. Robinson saying is that he wished for an opportunity to file something in writing on this issue.  

In terms of the Court's suggestion that we have submissions this week, that would be fine.  But I'm still not clear what is meant by "submissions".  

This -- it seems to me that we're at a juncture where somebody should be making a motion.  And right now Karemera is carrying the ball.  This is his Defence case.  He is presenting evidence.  He has witnesses that are waiting to testify.  So somebody has to take the first move.  I don't think it's appropriate to suggest that all the parties should just simply file submissions.  

Mr. Ngirumpatse has an interest.  He can make a motion to --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, could I address that? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Chamber is not content to wait on a party to take the initiative in this matter.  We want to decide to move forward.  

And if you wish, I could transform the remark I made into an interim order, requiring the parties to show cause why Mathieu Ngirumpatse should not be severed from the trial and to make alternative proposals for us to move forward.  But we thought the time had come when the Chamber itself ought to take a step to move towards deciding how we would proceed with the trial.  

So we want now to do that.  I refer that -- the part of the process I have taken such a step; that the parties should be ready to make submissions on it.  

So I -- if you prefer, I could raise the level of what I had said before to an order requiring the parties to show cause why Mathieu Ngirumpatse should not be severed or to make alternative proposals for the continuation of the trial.  

And we also think that the suggestion made by Mr. Sow was an opportunity to facilitate the presentation of Édouard Karemera's defence.  And so we also wanted to hear the parties on that issue, because it seemed a way of providing an opportunity to facilitate the presentation of his defence through the witnesses who are actually here now.  And it may be that that may have been something which the parties could express themselves upon and allow the Chamber to make a decision on these matters.  

So that's where we were on that issue.  We don't want to make a decision and we would like the parties to participate by making submissions on these issues.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Well we agree, Your Honour -- or, Your Honours, that we do need to resolve this matter and we need to move the trial ahead expeditiously.  And all parties are concerned that this trial be brought to conclusion and in a manner that is fair to all of the parties.  So that's not in dispute.  

I think it is more appropriate to make an interim order.  Even making an interim order still leaves open the question of what would be the consequence of the severance.  And these are things that the Defence parties have to make explicit and that the Prosecution should be in a position to respond to.  

So in terms of making an interim order, I would like to hear Mr. Sow's proposal and Mr. Ngirumpatse's proposal before we are invited to respond.  So that's simply the point I'm making; that somebody has to take the first step.  If the Chamber is taking the first step, by making an interim order, that interim order should make it explicit that Mr. Karemera or Mr. Ngirumpatse, who are the two parties most immediately challenged by the situation, should make their positions explicitly known.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  

Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Mr. President.  I believe that the Chamber has all the possibilities of addressing the parties as it chooses.  But I would like to recall that we heard a motion of the supplemental brief, in which way you found that these proceedings would be adjourned until January.  

I believe that on the basis of that motion, if the Chamber has no other means of calling on the parties to present observations, the Chamber has the possibility of rendering an interim order to rule on our motion and move forward and ask the parties to answer these questions, but on the basis of the motion before the Chamber.  It could use them as a means of doing so.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

There's one issue.  What we are proposing to do is to rise now and make a written order during the course of this afternoon, which will address these issues.  

But there's one matter of concern.  The issue of Édouard Karemera's witnesses is an important issue, whatever other decision we make.  And we wanted to be in a position to address that urgently.  

You've heard the witnesses themselves.  You've seen the position.  And if we could actually 
take -- depose them immediately, or -- so what we want to do is to separate the submissions of the different time standards for the issue addressing Édouard Karemera's witnesses and the issue addressing the continuation of the trial, with or without Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Would that generally find your agreement?  Because, if so, we would want to be in a position to make a ruling on the issue with regard to Karemera's witnesses, by Monday at the latest.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I would actually like to discuss that point a bit more and return to what I thought I was putting forward when we first addressed the issue, is that, practically speaking, both -- either the deposition or the continuing with testimony from the witnesses in court is going to require the consent of Ngirumpatse, or it's going to be a factor in the Chamber's decision.  And if Ngirumpatse can consent to a deposition, he could just as easily consent to proceeding with the trial in his absence before a decision on severance is made.  And the most practical solution would be for Mr. Ngirumpatse to consent to hear the testimony of these four witnesses without being physically present.  

I don't see how that's any different from a deposition.  In fact, a deposition puts us at a loss, because it's not held in the Chamber.  The Chamber is not observing the witnesses.  A presiding officer would be appointed.  There would be cross-examination --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, you didn't hear me properly.  We are not doing anything.  And we've intended appointing ourselves as a deposing officer.  So we will hear the witness.  It may very well be as you have said, it's not much difference between this and the trial in absentia.  But why put that in the obstacle of moving forward if we can move forward?  We are not thinking of opposing -- appointing somebody else, because we have the time and the willingness and the ability to do it ourselves.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'll simply rely on the submissions of the parties, Your Honour, and the Court's decision.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  But my question was, we wanted to -- what we intend to do is to give a different time standard for submissions on that issue.  So we are going to expect submissions within the next day or two on the issue of Karemera's witnesses, even if we give a different schedule for submissions with regard to the continuation of the trial in general.  

Yes.  Yes, Mr. Ngimbi.  
MR. NIMY:
I'm sorry, Mr. President.  A while ago when we were talking about severance, did I hear you properly that there was a provisional severance because you used the word "provisional" or "temporary"?  Did I hear you well? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, no.  We have not made any orders of that nature.  I was inviting counsel to make submissions on this issue.  And Mr. Webster raised the point that it would really be more appropriate if there was an application.  So we did not want to wait on somebody to apply.  So I decided that the Chamber would make an interim order requiring the parties to show cause why Mathieu Ngirumpatse should not be severed or to make proposals as to how the proceedings could continue.  
So the order was for you to show cause on this matter.  So that's where we are at this moment.  No decisions have been taken.  
MR. NIMY:
I understood that one properly, Mr. President.  I believe it is the word "provisional".  Maybe it was a lapse that you had; you talked of a "provisional severance".  I think it can be found on the CaseView.  That is why I wanted to have a position, because it would be of interest in the subsequent filings that we will make.  Because you actually mentioned the provisional -- the "provisional severance".  So it's on the word "provisional" or "temporary", Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  In any event, we will be filing a formal order this afternoon in which everything should be made clear.  

Were there any other -- any other issues? 

Well, in that case, perhaps we could adjourn our status conference today.  

I will just thank everybody for cooperating as you have done.  And we would - 

Yes, Mr. Weyl? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, exceptionally, considering the stakes in that order, could the Chamber think of delivering that order at the same time in both languages, English and French, since it would be important for the Chamber to take that decision in both languages, and since, technically, the problem we raise about issues discussed in closed session, and its consequences in terms of referring to such issues in open writings and filings?  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, we can probably make the order in French.  It will satisfy the interests that you have expressed concern about.  

But just one other matter:  You've mentioned this both before and after the closed session.  And we can -- we can unseal the closed session that occurred this morning.  

We had closed that basically for the protection of Mathieu Ngirumpatse's privacy.  But in light of the remarks which you have made, and in light of the content of what transpired this morning, I don't think that anything was said which could cause embarrassment.  And if you thought it was better, we would be willing to make an order to unseal the proceedings this morning.  Would that suit you, you and your client? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, that would suit me except on the points for which I had objections.  
So I have no objections to the unsealing of the closed session.  But there are sentences that should be kept under seal.  Maybe you could find some intermediate solution to it, Mr. President? 
(Pages 36 to 43 by Rebecca McCoy)

































	1300H
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much, Mr. Weyl.  What we will do is that we will include that in our order this afternoon.  We think that we should not unseal the aspect of the session that dealt with the witnesses.  With regard to Ngirumpatse, we will review it again and we will unseal it to the extent that we are satisfied that there is nothing embarrassing that will be unsealed.  
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you very much, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Are there -- is there any other business to address before we adjourn?  

There being no other business, we'll take our adjournment now.  And thank you to everyone.
