MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good day, everybody. 

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday the 22nd of April 2009, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the 
Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

At this end the appearances are the same.  

Good day, Madam Registrar, at the video transmission location. 
MS. MUZIGO-MORRISON:
Yes, please.  Good morning.  We are all here.  And we have the witness and all the people who should be here are here. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Witness, good day to you. 
THE WITNESS:
I am present. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You're welcome to continue your testimony this morning, today, by responding to questions from the Prosecutor.  I must remind you that you remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began yesterday.  

Mr. Morley, are you ready to proceed?  
MR. MORLEY: 
Thank you.  With the assistance of Mr. Issa, please, some documents. 

Turning to the location and to Mr. Webster, the original bundle can be distributed now, although I mention to Your Honours that I have pruned the original bundle here.
LÉON MUGESERA (continued)
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you hear me?  Can you see me? 
A.	Yes, I can hear you, and I can see you.  I am hearing you, and I am seeing you, sir. 
Q.	Between April and July of 1994, tens of thousands of Tutsi civilians were murdered and their bodies thrown into the Nyabarongo river, N-Y-A-R-A-B-A-R-O-N-G-O (sic).  Where did that idea come from? 
A.	I left Rwanda in 1992.  And in 1994 I was not in the country.  It had been two years since I had left Rwanda.  I, therefore, indeed did not know the origin or the source of that idea. 
Q.	Is your answer, you don't know where the idea came from that Tutsis should be thrown in the Nyabarongo river?  Is that your answer? 
A.	Yes.  I do not know. 
Q.	Do you accept that between April and July of 1994 there was a slaughter throughout Rwanda of Tutsi men, women, and children who were civilians? 
A.	From what I learned while in Quebec, there were massacres of Tutsi, and I know some of those who died.  There were massacres of Hutus and Twas.  In fact, it was the entire Rwandan population that was affected by those sad events following the terrorist downing of President Habyarimana's plane, which was also carrying the president of Burundi, as well as their delegations.  That is what set the country on fire. 
Q.	Do you accept that the vast majority of those who died in the events following the death of President Habyarimana were Tutsi civilians? 
A.	That I do not know.  I don't know any precise calculation that has been made.  But I can tell you that even if only a single Tutsi was killed, that would aggrieve me, because a human being, even if there is only one human being, is -- or, represents the entire humankind.  So I do not know the figures concerning that era.  

And what I should tell you is that I was aggrieved by what happened following the terrorist attack on the plane in April 1994.  And you're well aware that when an event in history leads to disasters -- well, you know history and you know of the -- Helen of Troy, where Paris, the son of Priam abducted 
Menelaus' daughter (sic) from Sparta, that is, Helen.  You know what happened too thereafter.  

You know at least that in 1994 the attack on the heir to the throne of Austria, that is, 
François Ferdinand, was the cause for the first world war.  So, in those circumstances, if, therefore -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Excuse me, Mr. Witness. 

THE WITNESS:
-- you look into all these events in perspective -- well, you also are aware of the terrorist attack. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Excuse me, Mr. Witness.  I must say, we have been very intrigued by your --
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- outstanding historical knowledge and analogies.  But we are in a trial now and we -- I'd be grateful if you could keep your answers focused to the questions that are being put to you. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	You are an intelligent man.  You are academically excellent in linguistics.  You are one of Rwanda's elite.  You are also a very good public speaker.  We have seen the video of your addressing a crowd.  You are also someone who was quite involved in Rwandan politics up until the end of 1992.  Are you seriously suggesting you have no idea whether during the events of April to July of 1994 the vast majority of those who died were Tutsi civilians? 
A.	I will have to make it clear that in order to answer your question with precision, I would like to say that I didn't see any figures relating to those events.  

But I would like to apologise to the Trial Chamber in respect of the examples that I gave.  My idea was to show that such disastrous events will entail such aftermaths elsewhere as well.  It was only for purpose of illustration that I gave the examples that I gave. 
Q.	That is not an answer.  I will ask the question one last time.  From what you know of Rwanda and from what you were able to observe reported to the world and from what you have learned from Rwandan colleagues, is it seriously your evidence that you have no idea whether the vast majority of those who died after the death of President Habyarimana were Tutsi civilians? 
A.	My answer will be the same.  I don't know of any macabre body count that was made.  Now, if you know of such figures, please tell me and tell me how it was done, and I will be able to give you an answer.  I was not on the scene -- at the scene of the events.  I was in Quebec in Canada when all of that happened, and it had been two years that I had left the country.  So I don't know of any body count that was made. 
Q.	On the 12th of November of 1992, do you recall that the MRND entered into an alliance with the CDR in Rwanda? 
A.	I am not aware of that event.
MR. MORLEY:
For Your Honours' assistance, looking at the bundle distributed, on the left-hand side of the page, page 4.  But in the location, it would be page 30/1.  

Perhaps if the witness might be shown what, in the location, is page 30/1, reading the bottom right-hand side of the bundle. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
MR. MORLEY: 
And for Your Honours' assistance, this is D. NZ64. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	You should have there two pages, the second page dated the 12th of November 1992.  And it records an alliance between the MRND, the CDR, and some other organisations.  Were you completely unaware of this, given your political activity in Rwanda at this time? 
A.	I must say frankly that I wasn't aware.  I would have liked to have been.  And I don't see any reason why I wouldn't say so, if I had been aware of that.  If I had been aware of this, I would have told you.   

Besides, I told you yesterday of what I knew, that is, that we learned at the MRND préfectoral committee in Gisenyi that President Juvénal Habyarimana was giving money to the CDR.  And at the time when he received the MRND préfectoral committee that Uwilingiyimana, Juvénal, 
Bazimana (sic) and myself that were part of that committee -- now, we said, "We in the MRND, we don't have money and you are giving us money?"  Or, rather, "And you are giving money to the CDR?  Now, is this true?"  

Now, President Juvénal Habyarimana, who was receiving us as the chairman of the reformed MRND, told us indeed he didn't have any money.  Now, this is the only thing concerning the CDR and the MRND that I was aware of at the time. 
Q.	Of itself, that's helpful.  Thank you.  

On the 15th of November 1992, there was a rally in Ruhengeri attended by President Habyarimana in which -- 
MR. MORLEY: 
If Your Honours now turn to pages 6 and 7 within the bundle, at the location, pages 30/3, 30/4, being D. NZ47, and D. NZ48, a translation from Mr. Robinson and a translation from the Prosecution, what we have is President Habyarimana declaring that he will descend on the country with the Interahamwe and the army.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Do you recall this? 
A.	Yes, I heard about that. 
Q.	Moving on.  You made a speech on the 22nd of November of 1992 which was -- 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	-- noteworthy.  Do we not see that in November of 1992 there was a hardening of the MRND's position in alliance with the CDR, a declaration that the Interahamwe and the army would descend with the president that leads up to the speech you made on the 22nd of November of 1992?  
A.	I haven't quite understood your question. 
Q.	You were aware, before you made your speech on the 22nd of November of 1992, that the MRND's line with regard to dealing with the RPF incursion and political opposition was hardening and becoming more violent; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	No.  
Q.	The CDR has a manifesto which is in evidence in this case, and it describes the Tutsis being undesirable within the body of the manifesto.  Are you aware of that? 
A.	No, I am not aware of that.  But the CDR should answer for its actions.  I, therefore, cannot answer to what concerns the CDR. 
Q.	Did the CDR, in your view, have a racist attitude towards the Tutsis? 
A.	From the CDR statements that I heard and from a meeting that the minister of information held with the representatives of all the political parties, indeed, he was asking -- he was telling the CDR that they had an attitude that appeared to be discriminatory.  We in the MRND, we are a peaceful party, a party that advocated peace, unity, and development.  Now, you of the CDR, your attitude doesn't seem to be the imperatives of the law governing political parties.  

So at that time they told us, "Well, what we are -- what we do is speak the truth.  There are Hutus, there are Tutsis, and there are Twas in Rwanda.  And we have to clearly -- we have to use clear language in talking about Tutsi, Hutus, and Twas and that people should live with each other knowing that our people are different.  This is what I heard at the time, and this was a meeting that was held in the ministry of information.  

Now, as to characterising the attitude of the CDR as racist, well, it is not my place to do so.  Now, those who have concrete facts concerning the CDR, beyond what I have heard their leaders say, can tell you and they can -- that can help the Tribunal in making that characterisation.  But I cannot stand before the Trial Chamber and say this in trying to bring a solution to the -- an answer to the question.  I can't characterise the CDR as racist. 
Q.	You have characterised them as having been noted as discriminatory.  What is the MRND doing getting into bed with a discriminatory political party in November of 1992? 
A.	Well, I am telling you that I am not aware of those arguments, to start with.  Now, I -- who are those who reached the agreement and signed it?  I would like to see the argument to see whether it is the MRND's national secretary or chairman who signed it.  

But to - well, in characterising their statements as discriminatory, this was because they spoke a lot about Tutsis, Hutus and Twas.  And we clearly, at the ministry of information -- well, we, in order to give them airtime, since the various parties had to share airtime, we put this question to them so that they can explain their attitude to me, because we are hearing that they had a language that -- which addressed mostly Hutus than the entire Rwandan population.  

But they were telling us that they wanted to speak the truth, that the Hutus are Hutus, the Tutsis are Tutsi, and the Twas are Twas.  We are not taking it against the Tutsi or against anyone.  What we are saying is that we should live together, but that we should live together while knowing that we are different.  This is what the CDR told us at the time.  

Now, the idea we had, what you call the characterisation that's been made of their statements, was erroneous. 
Q.	In September of 1992, a report was made available, prepared by the army on the subject of who was the enemy in Rwanda -- 
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honours, pages 2 and 3, Prosecution Exhibit P. 198. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	-- against a background of the RPF incursion which had begun in October 1990.  And rather than simply say that the enemy is the RPF coming over the border from Uganda, what we see in this document, which, at the location, is page 2 and page 32, for the witness, dated 21st September 1992, over the page, "Definition of the enemy", top of the page.  No reference to the RPF.  

It says, "The enemy is the Tutsi, internally and externally, extremist and nostalgic for power."  Were you aware of that, that the army had prepared a report defining the enemy not as the RPF but Tutsis living in Rwanda and outside Rwanda who wanted power?  
A.	Yes.  I learnt about this from the report of the international committee, and this is while I was already in Canada.  But I would like to have a look at the document in order to know exactly what is said in there.  May I have a glance at it?  
Q.	Yes.  And while it's being put in front of you, being an intelligent man, you can have a look at it and also answer this question.  How is it, if you have become aware of this document whilst you are in Canada, this specific document, which characterised on the part of the army the Tutsi as the enemy, but you're not aware and have no comment on whether the vast majority of those slain after the death of President Habyarimana were Tutsis?  How can you know one thing specific about a document from the army and have no idea about the bigger picture as to what happened to the Tutsis in Rwanda?  Answer that, please.  
A.	You are asking me a multi-barrelled question there.  I would like you to ask me one question, one after the other, so that I can give you adequate answers.  
Now, as to the document that has been put before me, it is a document of the minister of defence of the republic of Rwanda, Rwandan army, army staff quarters G2.  And I see mentioned there "secret" or "confidential" and Nsabimana, Déogratias.  

And you will agree with me that even in your own country, even here in Canada, a document from the ministry of defence is a secret document and nobody has access to it.  And you will agree with me, therefore, that in all countries in the world, to have access to documents, to military documents, especially when they are categorised as confidential documents, this is quasi-impossible.  

Now, I would like to say, however, that I got to know about excerpts of the document and I think from the report of the International Red Cross.  

But, please, give me some time so that I can have a closer look at it and it's -- point out the page to 
me -- the point -- the page in question to me so that I can have a quick look at it, and then we can proceed. 
Q.	We will move on to the next document.  Thank you.  Please, can you have placed in front of you what is, in the location, pages 30/5 through to 30/24.  
MR. MORLEY: 
For Your Honours' assistance, left-hand side, pages 8 to 27. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	This is a copy of the magazine Isibo, I-S-I-B-O, for the week of the 22nd to the 29th of 
	November of 1992.  Looking at the front of it, there is a drawing.  And we see there, do we not, the caricatures of President Habyarimana and of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, hanging off a bus full of Interahamwe, descending on the country, following the speech in Ruhengeri on the 15th of November?  
A.	Have you put to me your question?  
Q.	Do you have the Isibo document in front of you? 
A.	I have just received this document, Isibo issue number 77.  But I do not see its publication date.  I'm looking for the date of publication. 
Q.	The date of publication is on the top left-hand of the newspaper, number 77, from 22nd to 29th November 1992.  
A.	No.  That is the date of the speech made by the prime minister in Gikongoro.  That is the date of the speech, and it's not the date of the magazine. 
Q.	I'm sorry.  We're obviously looking at different parts of the piece of paper.  The front page which says, Isibo.  Above the words Isibo, you will see small print.  Top left-hand corner, Isibo number 77 from 22nd to 29th November 1992.  Agreed? 
A.	Yes.  I have just seen the date of publication.  I have it.  Yes. 
Q.	We see a drawing on the front of that magazine where we have caricatures of President Habyarimana and Mathieu Ngirumpatse descending on the country, hanging off a bus with Interahamwe, following a speech on the 15th of November in Ruhengeri; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes.  I'm looking at that.  I'm seeing the drawing.  Yes. 
Q.	And we have reference to you at the bottom of the page.  This magazine records the fact that you made a speech in Kabaya suggesting that the Tutsis are repatriated via the Nyabarongo river.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Pausing there for Your Honours' assistance.  In French, for Your Honours - rather, Judge Kam, page 28; in English, for Your Honours, page 57. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Mugesera, you're looking at the front page of the Isibo from the time? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And it says you've made a speech suggesting that the Tutsis are sent back or repatriated via the Nyabarongo river on the front page, doesn't it? 
A.	Indeed that is what is on that first page, but it is not what I said.  That would be false. 
Q.	Well, we'll see about that.  But what we'll agree is that what you said in Kabaya caused an immediate stir in the local press in Rwanda.  And specifically, what was being said that you had said was -- you were suggesting that Tutsis get sent back to Abyssinia or Ethiopia, repatriated via the Nyabarongo river.  It was an immediate reaction in the press in Rwanda; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	I am telling you that I did not say that -- what this newspaper is saying here or any other magazine or newspaper that you're mentioning.  I should also state that the document I have here, known as Isibo, is a newspaper which was allied to the opposition.  And the editor in chief was Musangamfura, Sixbert, and he was for the RPF.  And when the RPF took power, he came -- he became the head of intelligence for the RPF at the prime minister's office.  

So I'm telling you that I am not the one who said the words that I can see here on this newspaper.  I never pronounced such words.  I never did so. 
Q.	It's funny that immediately the local newspapers in Rwanda think that you said something terrible and you didn't.  

And just look at the front page of Isibo.  The state of the country is on that front page, Ngirumpatse and Habyarimana hanging off a bus, descending on the nation with militants, the Interahamwe.  And there's you making a speech about sending the Tutsis back via the Nyabarongo.  That's what the perception in the press was at the time; that's right, isn't it?
MR. NIMY: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  
THE WITNESS:
Your perception of what you are seeing in the press is totally wrong, erroneous, and it is not the 
first time that the press is going to be wrong.  And it's not the only country in the world where the press can say wrong things.  As for the cartoon, journalists have the right to make cartoons, draw cartoons.  That is their right.  

But let me inform you that what were known as the Interahamwe were presided over by Mr. Robert Kajuga, who is himself a Tutsi, and he stated that the Interahamwe included Tutsis also within their ranks.  So, under those circumstances, I do not see what would enable me to comment on what the Interahamwe were doing or what the president -- their president -- their chairman was doing.  And they -- these are their ideas, and they are the ones who should respond.  And I should not respond on their behalf. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I need to express my concern regarding this document, Isibo, to which my learned friend, Mr. Morley, is referring.  But I see heads here.  But I don't know who is Habyarimana, and I don't know who is Ngirumpatse.  And how has he managed to pin those names on those two heads?  He even referred to this as a cartoon, and you know what a cartoon is in relationship to the truth, to reality.  So I don't know how he comes to be able to tell us that this is Habyarimana and this is Ngirumpatse.  I have concerns in that regard, Mr. President. 

If Mr. Morley can shed some light on this for us, we would be grateful. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Nimy.  But we think it's really for the witness to clarify -- to -- his answer to this matter is a matter for which the witness can answer.  He has, in fact, given an answer already.  And we would be interested in his response.  So we think the question can be put, and we would be interested in what the witness's response to the question is. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, I'm happy to help, although I would like to conduct the examination as I have prepared it, without being discourteous, without the assistance of Mr. Nimy.  

So I might turn to the witness. 
THE WITNESS:
If you're giving the floor to me, I heard the reaction of your learned friend.  As for the recognition of President Habyarimana on the cartoon, what I can see regarding the president is, I think that he has a gap in his teeth on the upper layer.  I don't know.  But as for Mathieu, I think it's his hairstyle.  But I would like to see again the photographs.  But I think this is what is being shown here on the cartoon.  

The person with the hoe and the sickle is definitely President Habyarimana because of the gap in his teeth.  But as for Mathieu, who is holding the firebrand, I think it's because of his hairstyle.  
There are no -- there's no mention of Tutsi in the word Nduga, which is an area of Rwanda, and at the side -- at the time it designated the south of the country.  Tumanuke Sha, we are going to descend -- go towards the south.  I don't see anything mentioning the Tutsis in all those words.

1715H
MR. MORLEY:
I hope that's helpful, Your Honours.  The upper figure appears to be Ngirumpatse, and the lower figure appears to be Habyarimana.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, your speech was broadcast on the radio from Kabaya.  That's right; isn't it? 
A.	The speech which I made in Kabaya was never, ever radio broadcast, either from Kabaya or by Radio Rwanda.  It was never broadcast.  And I said this yesterday quite clearly.  And I then gave information regarding the fact that the former ORINFOR programme director.  The ORINFOR is the -- Jean-Marie Vianney Higiro, who later became the director of ORINFOR.  And I think he was even -- it was even suggested that he be in the cabinet formed by the RPF when it took over power.  But in order to become minister of the information (sic), he was part of the MDR.  Thank you for having reminded me.  But I said that he wrote in the dialogue newspaper.  Unfortunately, I don't have a copy of it.  But he also wrote on the Internet, and I could be able to find that reference.  I must go through my documents for this.  Maybe during the break I will do that, to see if I have it.  But never was this speech put on radio.  Never.  Never.  And he used the word "never".  I remember that he was speaking in English and the word was "never".  

And I must add, that it was technically impossible because I was vice chairman of the MRND in 
	Gisenyi préfecture -- préfecture.  I wasn't even a member of the national committee.  And the MRND had as its -- as at its head the chairman, the vice -- the two vice-presidents and members of the 
	national committee.  So it was inconceivable that the speech be distributed nationally on radio from an individual of a constituency and the -- even the head of state didn't have his features go on radio in their entirety, unless there was some exception.  Normally, they would have only extracts.  So, technically, what I was able to see at ORINFOR, at the time when I was in the country, was that it was technically impossible.  

But I'm telling you that it was never broadcast on radio.  And I am very astounded and outraged to continue to hear this because up to the appeals section of the federal court, and we went through all the various instances of the court or the federal courts.  So I told you that Immigration Canada continued to say this.  

	And I remember the reaction of one judge of the Federal Appeals Court, who asked a question of 
	Ms. -- of Ms. Louise-Marie Courtemanche, who was representing the minister for immigration.  "And was this speech really put on radio?  Was the speech really put on radio broadcast?"  There, I understood that the judge wanted to ensure that this speech, which was considered bad, how could it have been considered to be bad if it had been put on radio at that time?  So this is a contradiction which is coming out of your mouth, as it has come out of the mouths of other people.  And I see that the Court should really be aware of the fact that this speech was not broadcast on radio.  And that is the truth.  What was brought on radio was Inkuru from Radio Rwanda, which I gave yesterday, and which was translated by the expert of minister, Mr. Thomas Kamanzi.  That is what was broadcast on the radio, and nothing else regarding this speech.  

And let me say, that this document was tendered in evidence against me by the minister -- 
ministry of immigration.
Q.	Is there anything else you want to say? 
A.	No.  I can assure you with certitude.  And if you wish, I can swear with my hand on a Bible, to assure you that this speech was never brought out on radio.  It was never broadcast by the radio.  Because those who insist on that, they fabricated a false Mugesera.  Maybe I'll come back to that if there are any questions related to this.  And this is part of the false Mugesera which was -- who was fabricated, in order to efface the real Mugesera -- to have people hate the real Mugesera. 
Q.	Within Isibo, if you go to page 14, we have word for word your speech.  
MR. MORLEY:
And, Your Honours, translation, page 61 in English.  And for Your Honours' brother, Judge Kam, 
	en français, page 34.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you show the witness the page? 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	So, let's see what you said.  This is in the press at the time.  Never mind your arguments about the Supreme Court of Canada, this is a contemporaneous document and it records what you said within a week of you saying it, word for word.  
MS. MUZIGO-MORRISON: 
May it please the Court.  Could the Prosecutor clarify the exact page that he is making reference to?  
MR. MORLEY:
I've said it before.  On the original Isibo document, it is page 14.  You will have it as page 30/11.  And I'm sure the witness is able to read Kinyarwanda and find it himself.  
MS. MUZIGO-MORRISON: 
Mr. Prosecutor, even the Kinyarwanda copy that we have is hardly legible.  Even -- especially the bottom bits can hardly be read.  
MR. MORLEY:
I'm not interested in being able to read all of it.  The witness can see and will, no doubt, confirm that we have his speech in press within a week in Rwanda, which, apparently, wasn't broadcast.  So one wonders how a word-for-word record was made.  

BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Do you remember what you said, Mr. Mugesera?  You began by introducing yourself -- 
A.	I can remember the themes but I wouldn't remember the speech word for word.  
Q.	You've been through several courts in Canada and they have pored over your speech in depth.  Are you seriously suggesting that you can only remember themes? 
A.	I'm sorry.  I was looking at the document, I didn't hear your question.  I apologise.  
Q.	And you know, as a fact, that annex 3 of the supreme court judgement, on the 28th of June of 2005, is your speech.  
MR. MORLEY:
For Your Honours' assistance, if it becomes relevant, within Your Honours' bundle, page 119 in French and page 189 in English.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	So I'll ask it again.  Are you seriously suggesting that you can only remember themes related to this speech, given how much court activity has surrounded it in Canada? 
A.	I'm looking at the document you've shown me and these proceedings, in fact, lasted a long time.  But what I can tell you is that even if you, yourself, were to make a speech, the following day you wouldn't remember it word for word.  The human brain isn't capable of doing such a thing.  I can remember the themes but I could not remember the speech word for word, but since you are insisting on this speech.  Let me tell you that I had not prepared this speech.  As I said yesterday, I spoke it spontaneously.  And, furthermore, I hadn't expected to make a speech.  When I was invited to say a word, I said that I didn't have anything to say and the president had spoken.  And finally, I was told, "Well, listen, you better talk because otherwise no one will recognise you."  And this is how I said a word.  I had no preparation in writing for this speech.  

Secondly, I didn't record myself, for me to be able to have a copy for reference.  The press of the party was not there either, as I have shown -- told you.  Never -- the secretary general would have had his speech recorded.  Had the press been there, it would have recorded the speech and I would have had a reference copy.  So I don't have a reference copy.  And even at the immigration department, when in January 1995 the immigration came to arrest me and throw me into jail, it was on the basis of a cassette that the Canadian immigration department had received.  And I also believe they had a translation.  And I can assure you that Canadian immigration department gave that cassette to the GRC, which is the Royal Gendarmerie of Canada, in -- in English it's the Royal Mounted Police -- 
	Royal Mounted Canadian Police (sic), because if it were translated literally, it wouldn't mean anything.  So it is RMPC (sic); is that correct? 
MR. BERTRAND:
Yes, that is correct.  

THE WITNESS:
So the expert of the RMPC, I think one Sergeant Peter Fraser, explained the cassette.  And this was after the fact, because I was already arrested.  And he found that this cassette had been -- had been made up and it had faults in it.  And with such evidence, they couldn't present themselves to any court whatsoever.  So if you allow me, I could look at my documents later and find exactly what he said -- his statement.  

Now, at that time, the Canadian immigration department looked for two other cassettes.  And they, indeed, found them and gave them to the same expert of the RMPC, who used sophisticated machinery on it, which was at the disposal of the Intelligence and Security Department for Canada.  So he checked on this document.  And all the cassettes were forged.  And I asked the lawyer whether what the machine had read was accidental.  So the sergeant -- Sergeant Fraser said that it wasn't accidental.  So it was really a forgery.  So you will realise that it was from that point on that Sergeant Peter Fraser took those cassettes and placed them in his extraordinary machine.  And that machine, from the forged cassettes, produced an original, which I call a false original.  

So under those circumstances, my lawyer put the question to the -- to the judge.  I am trying to quote because I'm trying to remember the right words.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Can we sort this -- 
A.	Your Honour, we cannot send Mr. Mugesera to die from a forged document.  Yes? 
Q.	Can we stop, please?  I'm not asking you about the history of the cassettes.  You have here, in front of you, a contemporaneous newspaper, word-for-word, record of your speech from Isibo.  

Now, you know that in your speech you called for the execution of the prime minister.  That's right; 
	isn't it? 
A.	That is not correct.  I demanded that he should be tried and executed if he was found guilty.  And I said that in regards to the law, because Rwanda was at war and it was facing an attack from Uganda against Rwanda.  It was not a war between Tutsis and Hutu.  It was an act of aggression against a sovereign state which endured a war of aggression by another state against Rwanda.  It was not a war between Hutus and Tutsis.  And in that document I referred to the aggressors and those attacked.  And I can say that President Museveni, himself, started preparing the attack on the 16th of July 1987.  And there is a telegram from Ottawa.  That telegram is very clear on that subject --  
Q.	Can we stop there -- 
A.	-- and he says this, and I quote -- 
Q.	Can we stop again, please?  I'm talking about the speech.  I'm not interested in telegrams from Museveni to Ottawa.  I'm talking about the speech.  Let's talk about that.  
You also called -- 
A.	I understand what you are saying very clearly.  You referred to the execution of the prime minister.  And I would like to point out that what I said was that he should be tried and executed, if he was found guilty, because he contributed in surrendering the country, which was a victim of an armed aggression to a foreign army.  And that is why I wanted to point out that it was an armed aggression.  And I said that because it came from the president of Uganda himself, and this was established in an Ottawa telegram of the 17th of July 1987, three years before the attack.  
I would like you to allow me to shed light on this document, in order that the Court should know precisely the backdrop against which I made my statement.  
Q.	No -- 
A.	"I am an English Canadian visitor" -- 
Q.	Stop -- 
A.	"Without worrying" -- I will stop here.  
Q.	Thank you.  You also, in the speech, called for the execution of any parents of children who were thought to have joined the RPF.  That's right; isn't it? 
A.	That is not true.  What I recall saying was that those who had sent their children to join the RPF should, indeed, go and join them, so that we should know against whom we are fighting.  And if we are attacked, we are allowed to defend ourselves, we are entitled to defend ourselves.  I would like you to show me the passage you are referring to so that I can respond accordingly.  

So I'll just state it briefly, what happened.  But this is subject to me seeing the exact passage that you are referring to.  
Q.	You also, making reference to the Tutsis, said that they should be pushed in the Nyabarongo river and sent back to Ethiopia.  That's right; isn't it? 
A.	I never made mention of Tutsis.  I would like you to show me where the word "Tutsi" features in 
	my speech.  I only referred to them once.  And on that occasion, I believe I was referring to a meeting 
	of -- or a rally of the MDR, which was being held somewhere.  But -- but I would like you to show me exactly where I make reference to the Tutsi.  But I believe that was the only occasion when I made mention of the Tutsis.  And nowhere else in this speech would you find mention made of the Tutsi.  And that speech did not deal with relations between the ethnic groups in Rwanda.  It was dealing with those who had attacked Rwanda and those who had been attacked.  And I said that those attacked were entitled to defend themselves if they were attacked and their property was attacked.  And the victims of the attack should ask those who attacked them to go away and leave them in peace.  Those attacked were entitled to demand that justice be done and that those who supported an armed attack should also be attacked.  Because we were in a period of very long electoral campaign and Rwanda was plunged in some form of chaos, and that is why I criticise President Habyarimana and the minister of the interior.  Because President Habyarimana, under the June 1991 Rwandan constitution -- 
Q.	Stop, please -- 
A.	He was under a duty and an -- to call the elections.  
Q.	Stop, please -- 
A.	What were you saying?  What's the problem? 
Q.	Let's just stick to the speech, please.  

What you say about the prime minister and the parents of Tutsis who have joined the RPF and about the Nyabarongo river.  But we can see in the translation of the Isibo newspaper, in English.  
MR. MORLEY:
To assist Your Honours, page 62.  And at the location, in English, that's 30/59.  Or, in French, is page 37.  Or, at the location 30/34.  In English, Your Honours, page 62, right-hand side, 
	bottom paragraph, last paragraph, "According to the law."  And in French, page 37, left-hand side, 
	half way down the page, "Selon la loi."  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	You say:  "According to the law, any person who demoralises the soldiers at the front shall be condemned to death.  That is provided for by the law.  What are they waiting for to condemn this person to death?  The prime minister, Nsengiyaremye", N-S-E-N-G-I-Y-A-R-E-M-Y-E, "should be charged and condemned to death.  The laws are there and they are written.  He is liable to the death penalty, according to the law.  The fact that he is prime minister should not cause you to be afraid."   

You're not really calling for a trial there; are you? 

And we move on.  Dealing now with what is said about parents.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honours, page 63 in English.  In French, page 37.  
MS. MUZIGO-MORRISON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  

Could the Prosecutor please indicate the exact page he would like put before the witness.  
MR. MORLEY:
I will.  Thank you.  I'm simply assisting the Judges at the moment.  

Your Honours, pages 63.  Is that right?  And page 37.  At the location, in French, page 30/34.  And in English, page 30/60.
MR. BERTRAND: 
Mr. President.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. BERTRAND: 
Guy Bertrand speaking, counsel for Mugesera.  

I would like to make two remarks.  My remarks are on the questions and answers on the speech.  The minister has not yet ruled on this issue, as required by the constitution.  

Secondly, you say that he is under a duty to respond to the questions and that he will avail himself of protection, if necessary.  

I've been looking for the paragraph.  I have not yet found it.  Neither has the witness found it.  And with all due respect, may I request the Prosecutor to indicate the beginning of the paragraph he is referring to, so that we may perhaps identify it, so that the witness can answer his questions.  

Secondly, I would like that the witness avail himself of the protective measures required, and that he should answer your questions specifically by, first of all, identifying the paragraph.  

We have not found the paragraph.  I do not know what is said exactly.  We have numbered our paragraphs in our case but here the paragraphs are not numbered.  Mr. President.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  I haven't yet identified the paragraph and it's about to happen.  I'm getting people onto the right pages first.  

At the location, in English, page 30/60.  At the location, in French, page 30/34.  In English, 
left-hand side, first paragraph, beginning, "Dear parents".  In French -- Your Honour is looking to me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We wanted to respond to the submission by Mr. Bertrand.  
MR. MORLEY:
I understand that.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We understand that Mr. Bertrand has raised an issue concerning the potential incriminatory nature of the -- of the question put concerning -- 
MS. MUZIGO-MORRISON: 
We have the document now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
Well, in that case, maybe I should enquire.  Was Mr. Bertrand submitting that the -- that this was a matter which was potentially incriminating to the witness? 
MR. BERTRAND: 
Yes, indeed.  All questions related to that speech -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
thank you -- 
MR. BERTRAND: 
-- are incriminatory.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  I also understood that you were inviting us to consider making an order under Rule 90, so that he would have the protection of Rule 90 of our rules.  Was that also a correct understanding? 
MR. BERTRAND: 
That is correct.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. BERTRAND: 
With such protection, Mr. Mugesera would be able to answer the questions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

We consider that we should make the order directing Mr. Mugesera to answer the questions.  And we specifically do it in light of the provisions of Rule 90(G) (sic) of the Rules of Evidence and Procedure.  

You may proceed, Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  

So that we're not lost, page 30/60 -- 
MR. BERTRAND: 
Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Rule 90(E) of the Rules of Evidence and Procedure.  

Yes, Mr. Weyl.  Do you wish to be heard? 
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Mr. President.  

I would have wished, nevertheless, that in order for the cross-examination to be fair, as the Prosecutor is proceeding, he should kindly point out to the witness that the document we are referring to now is not, strictly speaking, the transcript of a speech.  But, again, it is a translation into French of an article in the Isibo newspaper, number 177.  Perhaps this would enlighten the Court on the probative value of these documents and avoid a situation in which ambiguities would flow from an unfair cross-examination.  

I thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. MORLEY:
I'm sorry.  It's the speech.  It's quoted on page 14 of the bundle.  There is a preamble on page 13 in which Mugesera is described as a mad man who needs to go to hospital for calling for people to kill one another.  And then it quotes the speech.  And that is what you find on page 14 of the bundle as part of Isibo.  And what we have in the bundle is we have the Isibo magazine, the French translation of the entire magazine and the English translation of the entire magazine.  We're dealing with the record of the speech, in the press, in November of 1992.  

If I may proceed, please.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please do.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President -- 
MR. MORLEY:
Turn to the -- 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, it should be clearly stated now that we are referring to the translation of the Isibo article.  And it is not an authorised transcript, made by anyone, of a speech which is simply being related here in a controversial newspaper.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  

I think the position has been clear.  And what we are interested in really is the testimony of the witness.  I think he understands what the position is and he's able to respond to the question.  So we permit the question to be asked.  

I believe the witness and his counsel have requested, Mr. Morley, a more specific identification of the reference. 

MR. MORLEY:
The paragraph.  I haven't got there yet.  I'm about to do it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY:
I want us all on right page.  

In English, 30/60.  In French, 30/34.  In French, left side of the page, middle -- sorry.  Bottom of the page, last line, "Pourquoi ces parents".  Reading from there.  

In English, 30/60.  On the left, second paragraph, which begins, "Dear parents".  About six lines down, "Why are those parents".  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	There you go, Dr. Mugesera.  "Why are those parents who send their children not arrested and exterminated?  Why are those people, those who conveyed them, not arrested and exterminated?  Are you waiting for them to come and exterminate us?  Let me tell you this.  We ask that those people should be put on a list, charged in court and tried in front of us."   And as we read further down, 
	four lines, underlined.  "Exterminate these rascals.  I am telling you this verily, as the Gospel says." Apparently.  

You're calling for wholesale slaughter of parents of children who are Tutsis, whose children may have gone to assist the RPF.  That's right; isn't it? 
A.	That is not true, Counsel for the Prosecution.  I would like you to look at Kinyarwanda text and show me where I make reference to the Tutsi.  Where are the Tutsi in all that?  You have stated that Tutsi parents -- I never referred to Tutsi parents.  
Q.	If that's your answer, we'll move on.  

Turning to the Nyabarongo river.  
MR. MORLEY:
For Your Honours' assistance.  In the bundle, in English, page --
THE WITNESS:
Counsel for the Prosecution -- 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I wanted to move on, please.  This is not a dialogue.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may.  

MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	We're now turning to the Nyabarongo river.  
MR. MORLEY:
For Your Honours' assistance, in English, page 64.  In French, page 39.  At the location, in French, page 30/36.  In English, page 30/61.  In French, page 30/36, left-hand side of the page, last paragraph, four lines up beginning -- five lines up, "Dernièrement, j'ai dit ceci à un membre du PL".  In English, page 30/61, third paragraph, four lines up, "I said to a member of the PL".
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, the PL was regarded as a Tutsi party.  And here is what you say, in this speech:   "I said to a member of the PL, who spoke to me arrogantly, in 1959, even if I was still small, we made the error of allowing you to go out.  I asked him whether he had not heard about the Falashas who returned to Israel from Ethiopia.  He told me that he had not heard about it.  I said to him, You can neither listen nor read.  I am telling you that you are from Ethiopia and that we will push you into the river Nyabarongo which will take you back quickly.  So I am saying to you" -- you're addressing the crowd now -- "we should mobilise.  We should really mobilise."   

Do you remember saying that?
(Pages 11 to 21 by Rebecca McCoy)


















      1800H
THE WITNESS:
	That passage as I see it, in your document, does not at all reflect what I said.  And even the forged document -- forged from another forgery that was fabricated in the laboratory of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police that were - and the arbiter said that it was acceptable.  And each time he asked Mr. Bertrand, that we were not incriminated here when he objected to that forgery.  What I find here is a pure literal fabrication which had nothing to do with what I said. 

And under these circumstances, may I know the provenance of this translation, who translated it, on the basis of what cassette.  I honestly do not know what you are trying to do, unless you provide me with such details.  Because what I said was not recorded.  I have told you the MRND, which had a party newspaper, did not record that speech.  I would have liked to -- you to show me the recording of my speech and not to just say anything about my speech.  

	What I say is that this is a literary creation.  You have to show me exactly where you find all that.  Even in the fabrication made by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, it was translated by a Tutsi called Thomas Kamanzi.  We do not have the word "précipiterons".  I am really outraged.  And again, what you're saying that "I call on you to mobilise yourselves", I was referring to people mobilising to participate in the elections.  I do not know how you can distort what I said.  What I was saying was people should mobilise to participate in the elections at a time when there was chaos; there was a war against Rwanda launched from Uganda.  It was a chaotic situation, and the president was not in a position to put an end to that war.  And he was criticised for that.  He was criticised and I suggested that an election should be held so that we could elect somebody who would put an end to that armed aggression.  I will stop here, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
BY MR. MORLEY:  
Q.	Thank you.  Sticking to the speech.  Turning now, please, to a letter that was sent to you from the university of Rwanda in Butare. 
MR. MORLEY:  
In Your Honours' bundle, page 82; original, translation page 84; at the location page 101; translation page 103.
BY MR. MORLEY:  
Q.	Do you remember getting a letter from professor of history, Jean Rumiya, R-U-M-I-Y-A, dated 22nd December 1992, expressing disgust at what you had said at Kabaya? 
A.	I never received that letter.  I have said so on several occasions, and even at the level of the Canadian immigration.  I read it in a publication, but I never received it.  
Q.	You will know then, that at your page 101, second paragraph, beginning, "Monsieur Mugesera, dans votre sermon politique..." 
MR. MORLEY: 
For Your Honours' instance, in English, at the location page 103, second paragraph.  
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	"Mr. Mugesera," it reads "in your political sermon you seem to have launched an ethnic and political cleansing operation in Gisenyi préfecture against the Batutsi and members of political parties other than the MRND and CDR.  Whether this is a coincidence or not, you used expressions that hit home during the tragic massacres in Kibilira," K-I-B-I-L-I-R-A, "likening the Batutsi to the Falashas, who must go back home to their homes in Ethiopia, via the Nyabarongo River, preferably in pieces.  Such a speech is a disgrace to democracy.  I understand that one may make a passionate appeal in favour of his political party, but I am surprised that emphasis is placed on ethnic hatred and political intolerance at a rally of the MRND."  You're aware that the professor of history who wrote that -- you're aware that the letter was dated the 2nd of December of 1992, but you never received the letter; would that be about right?
A.	This is what I have stated:  I never received that letter.  In order for things to be better understood I would like to say that Mr. Jean Rumiya was indeed a member of the MRND.  I think he was even a member of the national committee, as well as of the Butare préfectoral committee.  I must say that Rumiya left the MRND and then became a political opponent or a political adversary who was very opposed to his former party.  I must say that - well, you mentioned the term "spare part".  Please, I would like the Court -- I would like you to show me where I said "in spare parts".  We are before a -- "in pieces".  

We are before a tribunal and I would like to go by the law.  And before a tribunal we should establish facts and not intentions.  I have never said "pieces".  I have never mentioned pieces or "En pieces détachées", in French.  And, secondly, he says that I talked about Tutsis.  I never made reference to the Tutsis in that speech.  I would like to ask the counsel for the Prosecution who is questioning -- who is examining me to tell me where the term "Batutsi" is found.  

A short while ago he talked about "Tutsi parents" and I never talked about Tutsi parents.  I know this question was put to the minister's witness and he never succeeded in telling me where I mentioned Tutsi parents.  It is all false, and what you are saying is totally false and has nothing to do with what I said.  The speech should be seen not in the context of an ethnic war between Hutus and Tutsis, but within the context of an armed conflict, an armed war of aggression.  And we should look at the original that has always been presented and which we have always used.  And there are no facts.  And, thirdly, even in that false original, we warned our -- we warned before the federal court -- and if you look at the speech, keenly and carefully, you will see that there is a formulation.  That will tell you that this speech is politically correct.  And the formula is as follows:  If X -- 

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, may he repeat his statement? 
THE WITNESS:
And at the time the foreign minister was there, and the proposition was put to him:  "Can you contradict that formula?"  And he was not able to contradict it.  Now, can you at least give that formula for the Court and if there are anonymous translations, and anonymous transcripts, that originate from an anonymous cassette -- everything is anonymous - how, therefore, can you say that you are establishing a fact there before a tribunal or a court of justice.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, there was a portion of your answer which did not come through, at least to the English listeners, which was dealing with the formula that you're describing.  So I do not know if you could repeat your answer, or that portion of your answer, please. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I will repeat it.  What I'm saying is that in that speech there are more than 15 conditionals.  But I think there are 18 conditionals in that speech.  And if you allow me, and it is from there that the expert (French spoken), who is a renowned or recognised expert on speeches, so he -- he came up with the formula.  Now, if X then Y, and Y is never X, unconditionally.  Now, if I have to refer to the document that I have, I am going to point out to you where those conditionals are, and you will realise that what you are saying has nothing to do with that speech.  Now, you're dealing with a literary text whose source I do not know.  Nobody knows who transcribed the text; nobody knows who recorded the text.  Because even all of the tapes that were presented were forged. 
BY MR. MORLEY:  
Q.	Stop, please.  
A.	What was the formula?  If X, then Y, and X is never unconditionally Y.  In other words, what I'm saying is that I have never said that -- I've never asked anybody to do anything without a condition.  Now, if this condition is achieved, it is only then that something will happen.  Under the circumstances, don't I have a right to lay a condition in an event where Rwanda is the victim of an armed war originating from Uganda? 
Q.	What ethnic group came from Ethiopia, Hutus or Tutsis? 
A.	The historiography of Rwanda mistakenly shows that it is the Tutsi who came from Ethiopia.  That is what the history of Rwanda tells us. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, you were the subject of an arrest warrant for your words in Kabaya; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	Which arrest warrant? 
Q.	You were subject to two; one issued in November 1992 and one issued in January of 1993.  Are you saying you had no idea the authorities were looking for you? 
A.	I became aware of those documents while I was in Canada.  I never knew about them while I was in Rwanda.  What I know is that the RPF infiltrators and their collaborators, for a long time, had been coming after me.  And this -- you will even find this in one of the poems of the poet Kimenyi, especially as I made a broadcast in the US and in Canada.  And my name appears in his review as a member of the delegation, and that is when I asked Canada to put -- to bring pressure to bear on Uganda, so that part of its troops can be withdrawn from Rwanda.  And, secondly, that an army should be put between the borders of the two countries to control the area for a while.  That is what I had requested so that the atrocities should stop.  If this had been done in mid-October 1989, as I had requested from Canada, this would not have happened.  So I mean, the war of aggression would not have taken place. 
Q.	Just dealing with the arrest warrant.  Now, you have described how you were in fear of the RPF and their infiltrators; why would that be if you'd made a perfectly pleasant speech in Kabaya?  And how would they have known about it if it had not been recorded or had not been made known to the public?  Why would you need to run away from the RPF and their infiltrators if you never said anything upsetting in Kabaya? 
A.	I didn't quite understand your question because you put many questions to me within the same question.  Now, can you put your question clearly to me so I can answer it, please? 
Q.	You were helped to get out of the country by the MRND, weren't you? 
A.	The MRND never helped me.  I have said so.  And I have said so in a statement.  Never, capital letters, never.  And besides I was not on good terms with my line hierarchy in the MRND.  So, they did not help me at all.  But that wasn't the question that you put to me previously.  I would like you to put the question to me so I can answer it, because you are leaving people with the impression that your declarations form part of my answers.  
Q.	Turning, please, to page 86 of Your Honours' bundle; at the location 105.  With the translation, in French, at page 93 of Your Honours' bundle; page 112 at the location; in English, page 96 of Your Honours' bundle; page 115, at the location.  We have here a handwritten note which is D. NZ61.  And it is a note for the president of the republic, President Habyarimana.  It is dated the 7th of December of 1992, and it is from the MRND political bureau, reporting the outcome of a meeting held on the 1st of December 1992.  

And you will see, turning to the French, at the location page 112; in English, at the location page 115, the purpose of the meeting from the outset was to examine the Arusha negotiations, Léon Mugesera's case -- that's you -- and any other business.  And if we now turn, in French, at the location to page 114, and, in English, at the location to page 117, it said this -- contemporaneous handwritten note from the MRND political bureau to the president:  "Mugesera's case:  Participants stressed that many people did not appreciate the speech he made."  And it goes on that the party must defend its member by asking the member, in line with internal arrangements, to screen its speeches.  A contemporaneous document, Mr. Mugesera, which describes how the MRND will defend you, wants you to screen your speeches the next time, and also observing that the speech you made was unpleasant; what do you say about that, then? 
A.	It is obvious that the speech was not pleasant, since in that speech I criticised the president himself, who was not starting the elections, whereas that is what I would have -- would have solved the problem of the chaos that was in the country in accordance with the provisions of the constitution.  In that same speech I also criticised and asked that the justice system should be set afoot, and look into the case of the minister who was not doing his job, and the prime minister who was not doing his job.  

So this was a speech that was very critical.  It wasn't a speech that had kind words to say.  You seem to be forgetting this.  And, by the way, the country had been attacked, and I had been in the camps of displaced persons -- persons displaced by war, and I saw the living conditions of people who were suffering.  And some of them had told us how they had seen people that had been disemboweled.  There are some who said they were disemboweled and sticks stuck into them right up -- right through their head.  They said they saw women whose private parts had stakes, and even feet (sic) inserted into, and some (inaudible) methods, methods referred to as the "akandoya".  And akandoya is spelt A-K-A-N-D-O-Y-A, akandoya.  
Q.	If we look now at page 76 of Your Honours' bundle, 93 at the location, there is a letter from the minister of justice to the prosecutor general, requiring your arrest.  Interesting what it says, given that you insist on suggesting what you had said at that speech was not particularly offensive.  It says, and I will read in French:  "Mr. Prosecutor General, from various sources present at the MRND meeting of Kabaya on 22nd of November 1992, Mr. Mugesera, Léon, made an inflammatory speech that is likely to mobilise citizens against others and even to bring about unrest throughout the country.  He said, amongst other things, that some Rwandans had to return to their homes.  In other words, to their countries of origin attributed to them by the history of African migratory patterns.  And if they did not return to their countries they would be inviting the population to confine them to the -- or, to throw them into the Nyabarongo river.  

"Furthermore, he invited the same population to -- to take immediate reprisals against those he referred to as 'ibyitso'.  I am asking you to carry out prompt investigations and to take preventive measures that are required against the person in question, because he represents a danger for the progressive security that we have today in many regions of the country."  It is a bit of an overreaction to a helpful speech in Kabaya, if it was helpful, isn't it? 
A.	May I give an answer? 
Q.	Well, yes.  What do you say about this?  Here's the minister of justice writing to the prosecutor general that you be investigated in circumstances where you insist the speech you made was not particularly offensive.  
A.	I would like to correct what you said.  I didn't say that my speech was not offensive.  Any criticism -- any hard criticism definitely will not be pleasant to the person that is being criticised.  I said that the minister of justice himself did not feel offended, and I haven't said that my statements were kind statements.  These were statements that reflected the situation.  And I did not pitch Rwandans against Rwandans, but the people that have been attacked against those who had attacked them.  So, those that had been attacked had to defend themselves against the attackers. 

And now, I will return to the letter itself.  And the first thing I would like to say is that you should note that the letter is confidential.  So, I didn't get to know about it.  It was an internal letter that circulated with the minister of justice.  It had been issued by the minister that I had criticised, and who was a member of the liberal political party, that is, the PL.  

And I must say that Munyamuka is Hutu and not a Tutsi.  And, therefore, you should not insinuate that the PL is a Tutsi party.  It was a party like any other party.  It had Hutus and Tutsis, and even Twas in that party.  Just as was the case in the MRND and other parties.  So the minister had his opinion, which I do not share at all.  He -- well, what he wanted is to give me -- hand me over to the enemy so that they could execute me.  He was trying to seek revenge.  I didn't ask Rwandans to attack other Rwandans, never, with a capital "N".  I was trying to ask those that had been attacked to defend themselves.  And in the river that I mentioned, I was talking about people that had been assaulted by those that assaulted them.  And this had nothing to do with Rwandans being pitted against other Rwandans on the Rwandan territory.  Never -- or, before the 1st of October 1990, never had Rwandans taken up arms to attack other Rwandans, irrespective of their ethnic origins or their region.  There was never a Rwandan army that attacked other Rwandans.  It was the Ugandan army of Mr. Museveni that had crossed the border and attacked us.  Now, I'm not saying that -- well, I mean, if Mr. Museveni attacks us, shouldn't we defend ourselves?  Yes.  
MR. NIMY:
I'm sorry, Mr. President.  Mr. President, I have stood up to talk about methodology.  I am well aware that the witness has to answer questions put to him, but I think that he also has sovereignty over his answers.  I realise that my learned friend, Morley -- Mr. Morley -- is not only leading the discussions, instead of the Trial Chamber, but each time that the witness has something that may embarrass the Prosecution, he stops the witness from speaking.  

The witness is trying to explain very important issues to us, and I consider that he has the right to clarify any aspect that should make us understand the context in which an incident occurred, or a fact was established, because this will also enable the Trial Chamber to understand the truth or the facts as they are.  So I don't -- I am not quite convinced with Mr. Morley's method of proceeding, whereby he only allows the witness to speak when he is saying something that is acceptable to him.  I do not know whether this is valid in your procedure, but I don't quite agree with that procedure, Mr. President.  And this is what I wanted to say.
MR. MORLEY:
I have asked the witness to stop on several occasions because it has appeared to me, and it has not been objected to either by Mr. Bertrand or by any of the Defence previously nor intervened upon by Your Honours, that the witness has gone off script.  We start with an answer to a question and then we go on to something else.  And the witness, in the past, when I have said nothing has spoken at length about matters which, I respectfully submit, are irrelevant.  And we are in the same position just now.  I asked him about the letter of the 25th of November -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, you do not have to continue.  We agree with you.  You may proceed. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you. 
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	In February of 1993, you were in Spain; that is right, isn't it? 
A.	Which date, please?  
Q.	February of 1993.  
A.	Yes, indeed, I was in Spain in February of 1993. 
Q.	If we turn now to page 105 of Your Honours' bundle, at the location page 124, we see here a letter dated the 31st of March 1993 from the Gisenyi préfectoral MRND office, addressed to the minister of the interior, about some matters -- the content is not important.  The letter is copied, we see over the page, to the president of the republic and the prime minister, various other dignitaries.  And at name number 17, your name appears.  On the face of it, still working with the MRND, still part of the MRND process, still associated with the party; how did that happen? 
A.	This question should be directed to those who wrote the letter.  The fact was that I was not there, and when someone is absent he is excused.  I was an elected member and there had not been any other elections for me to be replaced.  The fact that they did not know where I was, probably -- so they said that I was not there; I was absent.  But I did not participate in the drafting of this letter.  The fact is that I was not there, and that is what I can say. 
Q.	But, Mr. Mugesera, that letter shows that you are still part of the fold of the MRND.  Whereas, you were at pains to suggest that after the Kabaya speech you fell out with the MRND; you didn't.  They still embraced you as one of their own.  
A.	I did not say that I was dismissed from the MRND.  After the Kabaya speech, as a political party, I was never dismissed from it.  I was elected.  The resignation that I mentioned -- I think I'll come back to that because I believe you are making a mistake.  I was arbitrarily dismissed from the national secretariat of the MRND where I had been appointed as a civil servant, and this was by a presidential decree at the proposal of the minister for public service.  It was in the former MRND, and it continued in the new MRND until the president effected me elsewhere, if it was necessary.  But, under the circumstances, I was dismissed arbitrarily as a civil servant and I was transferred to the MRND.  I was never there as a member of the political party in question.  
Q.	The minister for justice resigned over the fact that he couldn't get his hands on you; that's right, isn't it, Stanislas Mabonyamzera (sic)?  I'm not sure if I pronounced the name properly.  Did you hear anything about that, the minister for justice resigning in December of 1992, or thereabouts, over the fact that he couldn't get the police to arrest people; and you were one of them? 
A.	Let me first of all tell you his real name:  Stanislas Mbonampeka, M-B-O-N-A-M-P-E-K-A, Mbonampeka, Stanislas.  

I think I saw this for the first time in the report of the international commission of inquiry on Rwanda, the CIA report.  And I was totally astonished that a minister can resign because he did not arrest Mugesera.  It is not because of me that he became minister.  So I don't understand how a minister can resign because he didn't arrest Mugesera.  He should resign for other reasons.  If he had reasons in his mind, you should ask him, because he was the one who was in the country at the time.  But I was very surprised for that to be a reason for a minister.  I wasn't a minister myself.  I didn't feature, even in the national body of the MRND.  I was vice-chairman of MRND in Gisenyi préfecture.  In other words, an electoral constituency, and whereas someone who is vice-chairman in a party -- 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President.  Very briefly, I would simply wish that you allow me to remind Mr. Morley that he had committed himself to stick to two hours.  But he may continue.  But I just wish to remind him of that.  He has already gone beyond the two hours.  It's a simple reminder so that we remain within the standards set.  
MR. MORLEY:
It's been two hours.  I'm aware of the situation.  I have been interrupted several times.  There we are. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, just maybe to support what has been said by Mr. Nimy.  It was not a commitment by Mr. Morley, but it was a decision, or a ruling made by the Chamber.  And I think it would be quite in order for the Chamber to remind Mr. Morley of the ruling it had earlier made.  
MR. MORLEY:
I am coming to an end, but I'll need -- if I may have it -- approximately ten minutes, which I would respectfully submit I plainly lost during interruptions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we think we can allow you. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	How did you get out of the country, Mr. Mugesera, and slip past all of the police officers who wanted to arrest you?  How did you manage to cross the border without being arrested? 
A.	I left my home in the evening of the 25th November 1992.  In the evening -- for us that's at night.  I arrived at the home of my brother-in-law, Marcel Munyangabe, who did not live very far, and from the fact that he could not hide myself in his home, because I would be eliminated, I left through the bush during the time that you are aware of until I reached Dr. Gatorano's home in the mountains in Gisenyi.  There are some people who came when the family were not there, and someone came to look for me and they said, "In the room there is a baby."  And so they left.

So I asked Dr. Gatorano to help me to leave the country.  Since he was a doctor at a hospital, he had authorisation to be able to move around, and he put me in his vehicle.  He drove me into the Bugoyi area.  And in the Bugoyi area I crossed, on foot, through the banana plantations and I crossed the border.  And it was on the 12th of December that I took the aeroplane in Goma up to Kisangani.  On the same day, the 12th, I left Kisangani -- I -- before I came, I looked at my itinerary, and I left Kisangani, I believe, on the 15th of December.  And from Kisangani, I arrived in Kinshasa the same day, the 15th of December.  I remained in Kinshasa from the 15th of December to the 24th of January.  And on the 21st -- on the 24th of January I left Kinshasa to go to Spain where I believe I arrived on the 25th of January.  

So that was my itinerary.  And I left Spain to reach Canada on the 12th of August 1993.  So that's my full itinerary for you. 
Q.	And so that it is plain:  When you got to Canada you were arrested soon after.  In fact, before the genocide occurred in Rwanda.  You were arrested, I think, in January 1994 in Canada; isn't that right? 
A.	No, that's not correct.  I was arrested in January 1995 by the Canadian immigration department. 
Q.	And was that pursuant to an arrest warrant being issued by the Rwanda authorities in January 1995 specifically for your arrest for having called for the Tutsis to be thrown into the Nyabarongo river, which is what happened to them.  
A.	I do not have that arrest warrant here to see whether it was thus labelled, but I think it was, indeed, in -- tendered into evidence and Professor Reyntjens, who said that he was the one who wrote that document, regretted the fact that he used those specific terms. 
Q.	Well, I do have the document.  Page 102 of Your Honours' bundle, page 121 at the location.  

This is a renewed arrest warrant for you from the Rwandan Republic dated the 13th of January 1995.  And it refers to, in the third paragraph, beginning:  "Étant dans un meeting populaire en préfecture de Gisenyi, sous-préfecture Kabaya, le 22 novembre 1992..." "...for having planned the genocide; to kill the Tutsis and to throw them into the Nyabarongo river.  His call or appeal was fully implemented on the 7th of April 1994, the date of the breaking out of the genocide."  And you were arrested under that warrant, weren't you, which the Canadians were informed about?  
A.	Yes.  But I must immediately add that the words mentioned are totally wrong -- totally erroneous.  And that the person concerned regretted this by speaking to an expert in Rwandan law, Professor Reyntjens -- the wording of this text.  So the text is wrong.  And I would like to say that this was not followed through completely on the 7th of April.  You know, why do you say the 7th of April 1994?  It was not that speech of Mugesera, but this is the date that the plane of the president fell.  And that what is referred to as "planning" is rather President Museveni.  

There is the telegram of the 16th of July 1997 -- 1987, and he called for the killing of Christian Hutus.  In this telegram, in black and white, you refused for me to read about the planning of the genocide in Rwanda.  It is found very well in this telegram from Ottawa.  And it was official and Reyntjens said that it was recognised as authentic by the ministry of foreign affairs.  And it is a document from the ambassador of the time.  It is a clear planning of the genocide.  This is how it was done.  

If you refer to "aggression" to the populations in Byumba and Ruhengeri who were completely displaced, 350,000 according to Reyntjens, and then one million which came to the city, it's almost a tsunami.  He insisted that there were -- the commission of enquiry even said that there were deportations.  Ruzibiza said that there were gas bombs which were hurled at the displaced -- at the IDPs who were bombed, who were displaced, they were gassed, they were chased from their homes like wildlife.  And Kagame himself stated that Tutsis in Rwanda needed to be killed because he considered them to be Hutu.  

So the Court knows all this.  I believe you have all these documents.  And you will also recall that the army, it would seem, declared in Bisege, in 2003, that he was going to grind the grain.  And you will recall -- you will recall that he mentioned in Nyamirambo the strategy of a spoon which could destroy a whole population.  And this was an army which was foreign.  It is not the Rwandan people.  These were foreigners who took arms.  And in this case it was the Ugandan army which attacked my country.  So we need to be very clear about who planned what, especially since the telegram is dated 16th of July 1987.  

I would like the Court to be able to be aware of this document so that we can know that this is a real war of aggression against the Rwandan people.  I have never instigated people to kill whomsoever.  It was only self-defence against a foreign attack.  Even here, in Canada, and even in the United States, any citizen must defend himself or herself against an attacker. 
(Pages 22 to 31 by Eleanor Bastian)







      1849H
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	On that note, your answer being that the genocide that was planned was of the Hutu to the arrest warrant which was issued in respect of you in January 1995, I simply suggest this:  You are an entirely unreliable witness.  You are a hardliner in the sense that you were for encouraging an attack on the Tutsis, that you thought the MRND was being a bit soft at the time in 1992, which is why you made an attack on the president and the minister of the interior on the 5th of July of 1992, that you were aware that there was a movement against the existence of a civilian Tutsi population in Rwanda, and that you articulated what should happen to the Tutsis on the 22nd of November.  Your words called for slaughter.  
A.	Objection.  Objection, Your Honour. 
MR. MORLEY: 
I'm not surprised.  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
I object against that statement by this counsel who is questioning me.  With respect, with due respect, he has his opinion, but his opinion needs to be viewed against the facts, when you look at what happened between the border between Rwanda and Uganda.  Who was in the -- in the aircraft and to what ethnic group did they belong?  Who was dying?  Does the Court not see?  

I think what is important are the facts.  And these facts demonstrate, through the telegram of the 16th of July 1987, that it was Museveni who planned all this.  

I didn't go against the president because he was soft on the Tutsis.  I rose up against the president because he was not allowing the elections to take place, because he was not acting properly, given this foreign aggression, not against the president because he was protecting the Rwandan people and that he was taking care of them.  The Rwandan people were made of up of Hutus, Twas, Tutsis, and the naturalised persons, and those are the four elements of the Rwandan people.  

And I do not wish to accept this gratuitous statement which is being made by the counsel.  This is a real lie. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Witness.  

That concludes the cross-examination by the Prosecuting counsel.  

I must now invite Mr. Robinson to indicate whether he wishes to ask any questions in redirect. 

MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President.  At this time I would like to offer as Exhibit D. NZ492, the two-page text of the broadcast made on Radio Rwanda that Mr. Mugesera supplied yesterday and was circulated to the parties.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ502 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. MJUI: 
Sorry, Your Honour.  The number would be --
MR. WEBSTER:
If I can interrupt for one second.
MR. MJUI:
-- D. NZ502.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Note should be taken that the number is D. NZ502.

Thank you, Mr. Registrar. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
If I can interrupt one second.  I was actually trying to get Mr. Robinson's attention before he started speaking.  This is (inaudible).  Perhaps Mr. Morley will address this at the conclusion of the examination.  But just to be a bit cautious, there are several -- there are several exhibits that were used during the Prosecution's cross-examination, and I'll just mention them, for the record, that the -- the complete (inaudible), the Isibo issue that was used in its entirety, with the translation into French and English. 
MR. MORLEY: 
If I may interrupt for a moment and thank Mr. Webster for his thoughts on the admissibility of documents used under cross-examination.  I propose to make the appropriate application once the witness has concluded his evidence.  And I'm waiting to see whether -- what has now happened is Mr. Robinson is indicating there is no re-examination or whether there is to be further re-examination.  But as is my usual practice, the application will be made at the close of the witness's testimony.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Morley. 

Mr. Robinson, do you have any further questions in redirect?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would also like to offer as Exhibit 503 the telegram referred to by the witness today during his testimony.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Technically, neither of the first two documents, 502 or 503, have been seen by anybody in the courtroom, but I'm not objecting. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ503 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

In light of that, I have no further questions.  
MR. MORLEY: 
I'm in a position -- 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I believe that was the witness speaking, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Just a question to ask authorisation to tender some documents that I mentioned during my testimony and another document concerning clarifications regarding Museveni's statements on aggression.  The document should be -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness -- Mr. Witness -- Mr. Witness -- 
THE WITNESS:
-- should be tendered. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
-- permit me to interrupt you. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I am quiet. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  I don't think that we would allow you to tender any documents.  Under our procedure I don't think we can grant you the standing to do so.  So your application would not be acceptable to the Chamber. 
Yes.  Mr. Morley, we will hear you now. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Thank you, Your Honours.  I have an application to put into evidence the Isibo magazine, the original plus the translations.  The witness is familiar with the magazine.  He even knows the name of the editor.  It's a contemporaneous document, and it's obviously an important document.  

If I may just have a moment, I will give the other documents. 

The letter, Your Honours, page 76, from the minister of justice to the prosecutor general, dated the 25th of November of 1992, a contemporaneous document explaining that there had been trouble created by the Kabaya speech.  The letter at page 82 of Your Honours' bundle, translated at page 84, from the history professor, Rumiya, to Mugesera, which Mugesera is familiar with.  Although he didn't receive it at the time, he's seen it subsequently.  

The arrest warrant on page 102 of Your Honours' bundle, dated the 13th of January 1995, which dovetails with the arrest of the Defence witness in Canada.  The letter at page 105 of 
Your Honours' bundle from the Gisenyi MRND to the interior minister dated the 31st of March of 1993 which shows that Mugesera seems to be a member still of the Gisenyi MRND team.  Albeit, he is absent. 
(Pages 32 to 35 by Tanya West) 


















1900H 
MR. MORLEY:
	And, finally, the annex 3 to the Supreme Court judgement of the 28th of June of 2005.  In French, page 119 of Your Honours' bundle.  And in English, at page 124 of Your Honours' bundle.  

Those are my applications.  All the other documents are already in evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Registrar, could you assist with the numbers, please?
MR. MJUI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, could you just give me a moment, I think Mr. Nimy wishes to be heard.  

Mr. Nimy, you want? 
MR. NIMY:
Yes.  Thank you, Mr. President.  I do not know whether my learned colleague, Peter Robinson, has completed his statement.  But I would like to point out to you that we intend to request your leave to tender into evidence an excerpt of a transcript in the Ndindiliyimana case, in which -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
In that case, if that is what you wish to contribute, let the registrar complete his comment first and then I will hear you on this matter.  

The registrar was attaching exhibit numbers to the exhibits requested by the Prosecutor.  And when that is completed, I will hear you on this first application.  
MR. NIMY:
Obliged, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar.  
MR. MJUI:
Document Isibo magazine will be P. 339.  

Document mentioned as page 76, letter from minister of justice, will be P. 340.  

Document mentioned page 82 to 84 will be P. 341.  

And document mentioned with page 102 will be P. 342.  

Document mentioned in page 105 will be P. 343.  

And annexed with page 119 to 124 will be P. 344.  

Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The translations, are they -- are they correctly numbered? 
MR. MORLEY:
The usual practice is A, B and C.  Kinyarwanda, A; B for French; C for English.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, you confirm that? 
MR. MJUI:
Normally, A stands for French; B for English and C for Kinyarwanda.  

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Admitted in evidence. 
(Exhibit No. P. 339A, P. 339B and P. 339C admitted)  
(Exhibit No. P. 340A, P. 340B and P. 340C admitted) 
(Exhibit No. P. 341A, P. 341B and P. 341C admitted)
(Exhibit No. P. 342A, P. 342B and P. 342C admitted)
(Exhibit No. P. 343A, P. 343B and P. 343C admitted)
(Exhibit No. P. 344A, P. 344B and P. 344C admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, do you wish to be heard now?  We can hear your application now, Mr. Nimy.  
MR. NIMY:
Yes, Mr. President.  

What I was saying was that we would wish to tender into evidence the excerpt of a testimony which former state prosecutor, Stanislas Harelimana, that is the person who issued a warrant of arrest in 1992 against the witness.  The excerpt of the testimony he gave in the Ndindiliyimana case regarding that famous cassette containing true or false contents of the speech made by the witness.  

In that document the former state prosecutor of Rwanda said -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry -- 
MR. NIMY:
That he, himself --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry, Mr. Nimy.  That document wasn't used in the examination of this witness, so there doesn't seem to be any basis for admitting it at this time.  
MR. NIMY:
In that case, could we tender it into evidence as an ID document?  I mean, the transcript of a hearing in another case? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  This is not the way to address that issue at all.  We are dealing now with matters which arose during the examination of this witness.  And that document was not used in that context.  

So if you wish to address it, you have to find some other way of dealing with it.  But it cannot be dealt with in this manner.  
MR. NIMY:
In that case, I thank you, Mr. President.  

When we will be presenting evidence in our case, we will try to tender that document into evidence on that occasion, that is, through other witnesses.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY:
May I enquire whether Your Honours are minded to sit tomorrow in relation to evidence, or whether Your Honours are of a mind that we next convene on Monday? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, first of all, let me deal with the witness.  

Mr. Witness, Dr. Mugesera, we -- your testimony has come to an end before the Tribunal.  And as we do all witnesses, we thank you for assisting us in our work.  You are now excused.  
THE WITNESS: 
I thank you, Mr. President.  

Most Honourable President, Honourable Judges, I have testified in all honesty for you to be enlightened consensusly (sic) and to have justice rendered in the interests of the Rwandan people, I have not testified for any party in this case.  I have spoke directly to you, as a Bench.  And I thank you for having had the patience to listen to me.  And I hope that you will rule in such a manner that peace would be restored to the country and justice will be rendered to my people.  

I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I think with regard to the future scheduling.  The position is that we will not be sitting tomorrow.  And there are issues concerning the scheduling which affect the re-called witnesses, which ought to be discussed when we rise.  And I would invite counsel to meet with the trial coordinator to address the issues of our future scheduling.  

So, with that I think we can take our adjournment now.  And the scheduling will be addressed later.
MR. N'DOW:   
Your Honour, the Prosecutor has an announcement to make.  If I could just have a spare two minutes to make it.  

Your Honours, as you may -- as one may have gathered from the grapevine, Mr. Morley, that you see, is, indeed, leaving the ICTR to take up an equally challenging and worthwhile task at the Lebanon court in The Hague.  It is a big loss.  And, indeed, Your Honour, that was his last appearance before Your Honours.  

It is with a heavy heart and a deep sense of loss that I make this announcement on behalf of 
my learned leader, Mr. Webster, and the entire staff of the OTP.  

I, therefore, crave Your Honours' indulgence to acknowledge his invaluable contribution to the work of the Tribunal, and this Trial Chamber in particular, and to wish him the best of luck in his new assignment.  

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl? 
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Mr. President.  Thank you for giving me the floor.  

Mr. President, sirs, I received a phone call from Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse this morning, informing me that he had just consulted the doctor treating him, that he had just been visited by that doctor and that he had come to congratulate him because the results of the most recent analysis indicated that at long last the treatment is yielding the required results and that it would probably be good for him to proceed with the treatment using the drugs that are producing those effects for the next six months.  

I would like to bring this information to the Chamber's attention because, at last, we can hope that Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse's health status is becoming stable, which makes us hope that in the 
final analysis he will regain his health.  

I wanted to share this information with the Chamber and the parties and to express my reasonably optimistic hope which we felt upon receiving that information.  But I would also like to inform the Chamber that we deemed it necessary to call the Chamber's attention to this in a supplemental motion which we'll find -- which we'll file subsequently, on the need to prevent all hurried decisions which -- by bringing Mathieu Ngirumpatse to Arusha, as we have been informed, in a recent medical report.  We would like to inform the Chamber that at this point in time, as the treatment is beginning to yield the expected results, we would hope that any rushed decision to bring him to Arusha would compromise the successful application of the treatment he is receiving.  

I would, therefore, call on the Chamber to be particularly attentive to that.  We've had so many reasons to worry over the past few months.  And that we wouldn't like the hopes that we now entertain be ruined by these rushed decisions.  

I thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.
MR. SOW:   
By your leave.  I believe it is the practice in our profession, whenever a member of a team is leaving us, we should say something.  

I would like to simply thank Mr. Morley for his contribution to the proceedings, although most of the time we never saw eye to eye with him.  I also congratulate him for his new appointment -- his new duties.  

I would also like to say that I will often regret the moments when he said, "May I assist this Chamber".  Whatever the case, we wish him a happy return home and success in his work.  

As for Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, we can only hail this announcement, also wishing him 
speedy recovery.  And we also hope that the treatment he is receiving will be revamped so that he can receive the treatment he is currently receiving and regain his health as quickly as possible.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I wouldn't like to lag behind.  

I am, indeed, very happy about the good news Frédéric has just given us about Mathieu.  Our health is the very essence of our being.  And when we have good news in that regard, we can only be happy about that.  

Furthermore, I would like to express to Mr. Morley our profound feelings of friendship.  That is life.  We meet, we struggle and we part company.  But we always remain human beings, whatever happens.  We will occasionally regret his absence, even if it is only for the sake of the humour, which was sometimes hard for us to understand, but which expressed considerable friendship and warmth in spite of his hard looks.  But I thank you, Mr. President, and I wish him a happy return home.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, on behalf of the Trial Chamber, we would like to join in expressing our regret that you're actually leaving the case.  You have been on the case quite a long time and we have become accustomed to your participation and contributions to the work here.  On the other hand, we have to accept that life moves on.  And we do wish you all the best in your future endeavours, both personally and professionally.  

So with regard to Mr. Weyl's announcement.  We have been considering Mr. Ngirumpatse's condition.  We take note of the information you have just provided and we will pay attention to it in our deliberations.  And we would just like to express our hopes that his health continues to improve and that he has a speedy and complete recovery.  

Mr. Registrar, is there any other business or can we just adjourn now? 
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Mr. President, I propose we take the adjournment now.  There is no other business for today.  
	Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

We take the adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1922H)
