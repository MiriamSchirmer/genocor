MR.PRESIDENT:
Thank you,
 Registry.
Firstly,
 I would like
 to
 say that
 in
 a
ruling
 handed down yesterday
 Eliezer
Niyltegeka
 will
 not be part
 of
 the
 joinder
motion
 filed
 by the
 Prosecutor
 for
procedural
 reasons
 that
 were dealt
 with
 in
the
 ruling
 handed down yesterday.
Secondly,
 I would like
 to
 say that
 Mr.
Hooper,
 counsel
 for
 the Accused,
 Rwamakuba,
has written
 to
 the
 Chamber to
 say that
 he is
not
 in
 a position
 to be here
 or
 to
 appear
this
 morning
 and that
 he will-
 confj-ne
himself
 to his
 written
 briefs.
I also
 note,
 based on our checking,
 that
 Ms.
Bourne is
 absent.
 A11 the parties
 had
agreed to this
 scheduling.
 Miss Bourne has
not
 written
 to
 the
 Chamber to
 explain
 why
she has not
 or she's
 not
 appearing
 this
morning
 and that's
 why Chamber has
accordingly
 decided
 that
 it

 can we briefly

 to

 that

RuIe 49bis,
 added as a resul-t
 of problems

 that
 "The

need to be concerned
 and the
 only
 reason
 we
go to
 this
 rule
 is
 because of
 the,
 perhaps,
overlapping
 effect
 between the
 motion
 to
join
 the
 three
 and take
 them out
 of
 the
major
 indictment
 and then
 the
 motion
 to
 joln
t.he balance
 of
 that
 indictment
 with
 those
 in
three
 other
 indictments.
Rule 82, "In
 joint
 trials
 each accused shaLl
be accorded
 the
 same rights
 as if
 he were
being
 tried

 an important
concepL and one which
 has been referred

Honour Judge Sekule
 was particularly
concerned
 about
 that
 proposition,
 at
 least
your
 Honour addressed
 us directly
 about
 that
proposition
 on the
 last
 occasj-on.
But because the Rules are
 silent
 in
 respect
of all
 else
 and because it's
 permissive
 that
these
 things
 may be done,
 w€ would
 submit
that
 they
 can be done within
 the
 present
structures,
 they
 can be done within
 the
conflnes
 of
 the
 confirmed
 indictments.
There would be no need in
 our
 submission
 to
reconstitute
 indictments
 in
 different
 forms.
Of course,
 that
 would apply
 if
 your

were against
 us on that,
 that
 probably
 woul-d
apply
 in

 of
 the
 larger
 of
 the
indictments
 and in
 respect
 of
 the
 indictment
with
 two people
 in
 it,
 because one of
 those
hasn't
 been arrested.
One of
 our
 concerns
 was that
 if
 there
 was ,an
amendment to
 the
 indictment,
 then
 t,he time
for
 preliminary
 motions
 might
 well
 start
again.

Rule 50 seems to
 address
 that.
 Rule 50,
Amendment. of
 Indictments,
 'rThe Prosecutor
may amend an indictment
 without
 prior
 leave
up to
 a certaj,n
 time
 and then
 after
 the
initial
 appearance
 of
 the Accused,
 pursuant
to Rule 62, only
 with
 the
 leave
 of
 the
 judge
who confirmed
 it,
 but
 in
 exceptional
circumstances
 by somebody else. "
And b,
 "rf
 the
 amended indictment
 includes
new charges
 and the Accused has already
appeared
 before
 a Trial
 Chamber in
accordance
 with
 RuIe 62 a further
 appearance
sha11 be held,
 as soon as practicable,
 to
enable
 Lhe Accused to
 enter
 a plea
 on the
new charges. "
 There would,
 in
 fact,
 be nc,
new charges
 in
 any amended indictment.
And, c,
 of
 course,
 says 'tThe Accused shall
have a further
 period
 of
 30 days in
 which
 to
file
 preliminary
 motions
 pursuant
 to
 Rule
 72
in
 respect
 of

amended indictments.
 However,
 however,
having
 said
 that,
 w€ urge
 your
 Honours noL
to
 take
 that
 view,
 in
 any event,
 for
 the
reasons
 that
 we expressed
 on the
 last
occasion
 and,
 in
 summary, they
 are
 these.
That
 the
 structure
 of
 the
 j-ndictment
 applies
to
 each and every
 one of
 the
 accused.
The only
 irrelevant
 parts
 are
 those
 parts
relating
 to those
 accused who wontt
 be
appearing
 in
 that
 particular
 trial.
Therefore,
 if
 necessary,
 we can simply
redact
 those parts
 of
 the,
 of
 the
 indictment
in
 each case.
There is
 a practical
 issue,
 which
 I think
 we
mentj-oned last
 tj-me, ds we1I,
 and that
 is
the
 numbering
 of
 indictments.
 If
 such a
joinder
 is
 allowed
 by your
 Honours,
 then,
 of
course,
 there
 would need to be some
procedural
 handling
 of
 that
 by renumbering
or
 something.
 I know that
 the
 Registry
 is
quite
 anxious
 about
 that

Your Honours,
 just
 in

the
 common interest
 of
 all
 of
 the Accused
that
 we seek to
 join
 in
 this
 case,
 that
 is
the
 eight
 Accused,
 are all
 members of

 and when one looks
 at
 the
indictments
 they
 are joined
 appropriately:
There

 common interest

 There
is
 the
 common purpose
 set
 out,
 and there
 is

 injoining
these

Your Honours,
 I know that
 in

 the
 responses
 to
 our
motion
 the practical
 consequences of
 these

 are raised,
 for

 the

of

 raised.
But,
 as you can see today,
 there
 are

significant
 number of Accused
 in

 there

 is
 objecting,
 same
as all

 Accused here,
 objecting
 t'o
the

 motion
 filed

 Prosecutor:.
My client
 objects
 to
 that
 joinder
 motj-on on
the
 basis
 that
 it

 and the

 uses three
 grounds.

Second reason,

 it
 is

The third
 one,
 the

 is

Let
 me take
 the
 first
 ground,
 that
 it
 is
founded in
 1aw.
 As far
 as I'm
 concerned,
 I
don't
 have any probl-em with
 that,
 so I do
indeed
 acknowledge
 the
 fact
 that
 we can
consider
 this
 motion
 as founded
 in
 law.
 But
it
 being
 founded in
 1aw doesntt
 necessarily
mean that
 it
 will
 be upheld
 on the
 other
grounds
 that
 have been brought
 by the
Prosecutor,
 and if
 you look
 at
 them,
 that
would not
 be the
 case.
 The second ground
 is
that
 it
 is
 founded
 based on the
 evidence
 and
he says that
 the
 accused here
 are bej-ng
charged
 for
 conspiracy
 with
 a view
 to
committing
 genocide,
 complicity
 in
 genocide
and crimes
 against
 humanitY.
WelI,
 ffiy client
 Jean de Dieu
 Kamuhanda is
not
 being
 charged
 wiLh
 j-ncitement
 to
 commit
genocide.
Then we are told
 that,
 we1I,
 they
 were al-L
ministers
 and therefore
 they
 were parties
 to
so where do I now start?
Anyway,
 well,
 the
 second
 ground,
 namely
 that

the
 joinder
 motion
 j-s warranted
 or
 is
founded
 in
 l-aw or based on evidence
 and we
are told
 that
 the Accused were all
 members
of
 the
 interim
 government
 and in
 that
capacity
 they were parties
 to
 a plan
 to
commit genocide.
 In their
 capacity
 as
members of
 the
 interim
 government
 when they
took
 the
 oath,
 they
 supported
 the
 plan
 to
engage in
 an extermination
 plan.
 Between
the
 l-Oth of
 July
 and the
 end of
 late
 , 94,
they
 were informed
 of
 the
 massacres
 and they
did
 not
 object
 to
 said
 massacres.
 They had
never
 renounced
 the
 pursuit
 of
 a part.icu1ar
policy
 and they
 fail-ed
 in
 their
 duty
 to
guarantee
 the
 security
 of
 the
 population.
fn the
 case of
 t,he Accused,
 ,Jean de Dieu
Kamuhanda can not
 but
 note
 that
 all
 of
 those
allegations
 are unfounded,
 firstly,
 because
my client
 was appointed
 minister
 on the
 25;th
of May, L994.
 Consequently,
 in
 no
circumstances
 can he be held
 responsible
 for
events
 that
 occurred
 prior
 to his
appointment
 and,
 in
 my view,
 aware of
 that
difficulty

Kamuhanda supported
 or
 accepted
 to
 be
appointed
 minister
 two months after
 the
commencement of
 the
 massacres
 and,
accordingly,
 he thought
 he coul-d avoid
 said
difficulty
 by suggesting
 that
 my client
 was
in
 any case appointed
 minister
 after
 the
events.
Obviously,
 I do not
 agree with
 that
submission.
Mr.
 ,Jean de Dieu
 Kamuhanda was indeed
appointed
 minister
 on the
 25tt: of
 May, 1994
and he acknowledges
 that
 fact.
 He intends
to
 explain
 on his
 own appointment
 at
 some
stage
 in
 the proceedings.
 It
 would be
premature
 to do so now, and it
 is
 absolutely
false
 to
 suggest
 that
 his
 belonging
 to
 that
government
 automatlcally
 serves
 as the
proper
 ground
 for
 the
 charges
 being
 brought
against
 him,
 firstly
 because on the
 25th of
May, L994 that
 interim
 government,
 the
 l-east
that
 one can say was that
 it
 wasn't
 in
 a
good posture
 and .Tean de Dieu

each and every

 t,o Look for
 how
to

Two cabinet
 sessions,
 the
 first
 one,
according
 to
 the
 Prosecutor,
 took
 place
the
 first
 one took
 place
 on the
 25th of May,
1994.
 The second one was on the
 27th
 of
May, 1994 and after
 that,
 there
 was no other
session.
He wasn't
 able
 to
 set
 up his
 ministry
 or hi-s
cabinet,
 he was not
 in
 touch
 with
 the
 civi.l
servants
 working
 in
 his
 ministry.
 He wasrtrt
even abl-e to go to
 his
 ministry
 in
 view
 of:
the
 fact
 that. all
 the
 institutes
 of
 higher
learning
 were cl-osed in
 view
 of
 the
situation.
 So it
 is
 fal-se and totally
incorrect
 to
 suggest
 that
 as Minister
 in
Charge of
 Higher
 Education
 and Research
Kamuhanda exercised
 any authority,
whatsoever,
 over
 the
 civil-
 servants
 who were
working
 in
 his
 ministry
 because he wasn't
able
 to meet any of
 those
 civil
 servants.
He wasn'L even in

(CONTINUING) :
So I think
 I was trying
 to
 say that
 .Tean de

 Kamuhanda only
 attended
 two cabinet
sessions
 and he wasn't
 able
 to get
 in
 touch
with
 the officers
 in

 that
 he
wasnrt

 to
 set
 up his
 own cabinet
 and he
wasn't
 even abLe to go to his

 and
as far
 as I am concerned
 it
 wouLd be
incorrect
 to
 alIege
 that
 there
 was any
 or
he exercised
 any authority
 whatsoever
 over
the officers
 of his
 ministry
 or
 the
 officers
who were accountabLe
 to
 him.
 Furthermore,
the
 fact, of
 belonging
 to
 t.he j-nterim

 i-s not
 enough ground
 to
 use in
saying
 that,
 we11, he was involved
 in

 or
 involved

as suggested

 the
 members of

were 19 in

 Some of
 them are here.
Orders
 are being
 sought,
 and some of
 them
are not

 and ftm
 not
 trying
 to
say to the

 to
 try
 and,
 I don't
know,
 investigate
 and arrest
 them.

that,
 we1l,
 the
 initiative
 to
 engage in
prosecution
 or
 to
 investigate
 anyone lies
with
 the
 Prosecutor.
 From his
 submj-ssion,
it
 would appear
 that
 the
 very
 fact
 of
belonging
 to
 the
 Government
 does not
automatically
 implicate
 someone, sd!r
 in
genocide
 or a plan
 to
 commit genocide.
 My
cLient
 was minister
 for
 a very
 short
 period
and, y€s,
 he was appointed
 minister,
 but
 he
wasn't
 ever
 abl-e to perform
 the
 duties
incumbent on a minister.
 He couLdn't
 carl:y
out
 the duties
 assigned
 to
 a minister.

 y€s,

Kamuhanda was an advisor
 to

the

 He was an

 I would ask you,
 if

hearing
 of
 the
 5th
 of

 during
which
 one of
 the Accused
 handed over
 to

 a copy of

 is,
 the official
 gazette
 of
 the

carefully,
 you would notice
 that

certainly
 was certainly
 not
 an
influential
 member of
 the
 MRND. He was not
even a member of
 the
 MRND that
 exercised
 any
authority
 whatsoever
 at whatever
 Ievel,
 so
it
 is
 a mere allegation
 just
 for
 the
Prosecutor
 to
 suggest
 that
 my client
 was an
rnfl-uential
 member of
 the

 It
 is
totally

 totally

 It

 this

 were handed

disappears.
 It
 is
 in

 version,
but
 in
 the
 French version
 that
 post
 does not

 I donrt

 it
 an error

 That would be a bit

I think
 it
 is
 the
 Prosecutor
 who didnrt
think
 it
 was necessary
 to
 include
 it
 in
 the

 because that
 was not
something
 that
 was true

I hope I have been abLe to

 to
 you that
my client,
 as mj-nister,
 coul-d not

to
 any plan
 as suggested

because he came

 Well , af

 you are to1d,
 we11, ,Jean de Dieu
Kamuhanda commitLed
 a number of,
 sdy,
 crimes
in
 the
 rural-
 Kigali
 and charact,erized
 as
crimes
 against
 humanity.
 Assuming
 those
facts
 are proved
 in
 the
 case of
Kigali-rural,
 we are told
 that
 these
 evenLg
occurred
 at
 or about
 the
 1,2Lh of Apri1.
WeII,
 Kamuhanda wasn't
 yet
 a member of
Government,
 so what is
 he doing
 here?

here
 were not
 involved
 in
 the
 events
 that
occurred
 in
 Kigali-rural,
 so I do not
understand
 why he shoul-d be tried
 with
 them.
On the
 contrary,
 it
 seems to me if
 we comply
with
 your
 judgment, in
 the
 case of
 Prosecutor
v.
 Kayishema,
 the
 connection,
 the
 link
 hasl
to be establ-ished,
 and in
 this
 case there
 is
no l-ink
 whaEsoever between the
 conduct
 of my
own client
 the others,
 and it
 is
 for
 that
reason
 that
 I am of
 the
 view
 t.hat there
should
 be no joinder.
 Again,
 regarding
 the
events
 that, occurred
 in
Kigali-ruraL,
 even though
 that
 is
 not
 the
purpose
 of
 the hearing
 today,
 and my client
will
 have any and every
 possibility
 to
explain,
 ,-Teande Dieu Kamuhanda objects
 to
the allegations
 made with
 respect
 to his
conducL at
 Gikomero because he was accused
of
 having
 been present
 at
 Gikomero
 on the
L2th of April.
 He was never
 there,
 nej-ther
before
 or af ter
 the
 l-2th of April
 .
 We wi.l1
be pleased
 to prove
 to you,
 with
 a number of
witnesses
 prove
 to you that
 ,.Teande Dieu
Kamuhanda was in
 Kigali
 city
 up ti11
 the
l-Bth of April
 and moved on to
 Gitarama,

he never
 was at
 Kiqali-rural.
 That
allegation,
 therefore,
 is
 unfounded.
The third
 ground
 set
 out
 by the
 Prosecuto::
in
 support
 of
 the
 joinder
 was that,
 we11,
the
 joinder
 is
 necessary
 in
 order
 to
 ensu::e
a proper
 administration
 of
 justice.
 There,
again,
 I object,
 firstly,
 because you are
being
 told,
 weII,
 it
 is
 for
 the protection
of witnesses,
 that
 it
 would be unfortunate
to bring
 the witnesses
 several-
 times
 before
you.
 It
 is
 very
 difficult
 for
 them to
 leave
their
 family
 or
 their
 work and they
 mlght
 be
traumatized
 by the
 questions
 that
 would be
put
 to
 them by the
 Prosecution,
 then
 the
cross-examination,
 and it
 would be better
for
 them to
 appear
 just
 once before
 you.
WeII,
 I will
 say maybe for
 the
 other
 Accused
that
 would be the
 case.
Now, if
 you look
 at paragraph
 41 of
 that
joinder
 motion,
 some of
 the witnesses
 who
would be moving to
 and fro
 are not
 witnesses
for
 my own client.
 The witness
 who appear
in
 the materials
 that
 I
 received,
 well,
 are

not
 those
 that
 would need Eo appear
 for
those
 here,
 for
 the Accused here,
 and thelr
would
 only
 need to
 appear
 here
 once and they
do not. even have to
 appear
 in
 the
 case of
Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda.
 So to
 suggest
 thett
the protection
 of witnesses
 would make it
necessary
 for
 there
 to be a joinder
unfounded.
 You are also
 told
 that
 it
 is
 tn
the
 interest
 of
 justice
 and that
 it
 requi::es
that
 al-l
 the Accused here
 be tried
 together.
Even if
 this
 was to unduly
 extend
 the
proceedirgs,
 it
 would be still
 be within
 a
reasonable
 time
 1imit,
 and the
 Prosecutor
says,
 rather
 beautifully,
 that
 in
 view of
the
 fact
 that
 the
 charges
 are
 founded
 or
 in
view
 of
 the
 envisaged
 sentence,
 if
 you
aLlowed the motion,
 the
 extending
 of
 the
proceedings
 would be so prejudicial
 Lo the
Accused.
 Then you are being
 told
 that,
well,
 they may be sentenced
 to
 life
imprisonment,
 so what difference
 would
 that
make as far
 as the Accused are
 concerned?
We11, I think
 it
 would be make a lot
 of
dif f erence.
 It
 would be in violation
 of
 t.he
princi-ple
 of
 the presumption
 of
 innocence,,

the

 It

 It

 principle
 in

and we cannot
 just
 say that,
 in
 any case,
they
 might
 be subject
 to
 life
 imprisonment
and,
 therefore,
 it
 wouldn't
 serve
 any
 I
don't
 think
 that
 would apply.
 As far
 as my
own client
 is
 concerned,
 he wishes
 to
 rely
on Rules
 19 and 20 of
 the
 Rules
 of
 Procedure
and Evidence
 and he is
 anxious
 to
 explain
himself
 before
 here.
 He would like
 his
trial
 to be expedited
 and for
 him to provide
the
 evidence
 as to
 the
 fact
 that
 all
 the
allegations
 against
 him are unfounded.
 So,
in
 the
 case of
 .Tean de Dieu

would be no cause fori
 oi-nder.

Ms. Cond6, well,
 I
 followed
 you in

occasionally
 in
 English.
 Please have pitl'
on the
 interpreters
 so that
 your
 ideas
 cottld
be properly
 articulated.
 I think
 it
 wouLd
be in
 t.he interest
 of your

 That
stated,
 you said
 that
 your
 client
 was
appointed
 minister
 in
 charge
 of

 on t.he 25th of

Is
 that
 correct?
Yes.
 It
 is
 correct.
According
 to your
 submission,
 when did
 the
massacres occur,
 the period?
We1I, according
 to
 the
 Prosecution,
 it
 was
between the
 9th of April
 and mid-Ju1y.
Mid-July?
That's
 what I read in
 the
 documents given
 to
me by the
 Prosecutor.
Because when you dealt
 with
 the
 area,
 the
aspect
 of
 evidentj-ary
 material,
 you said
that
 your
 client
 was appointed
 on the
 25th
of May L994 and he attended
 just
 two cabinet
meetings.
That's
 correct.

 it
 is

 I can't
 quote
but
 it
 is
 stated
 somewhere that
 the
Prosecution
 does have the
 agenda,
 or when he
took
 diary,
 of Mr.
 Kamuhanda and that
 in
 a
particular
 period
 there
 were some meetingsl.
WeI1, ds far
 as I am concerned,
 y€s,
 my
client
 attended
 the
 meeting
 the
 cabinet
meeting
 on the
 25th
 of
 May L994 when took
the
 oath
 and then
 he attended
 one other
cabinet
 meeting
 and he doesn't
 acknowledge
or
 agree to
 the
 fact
 that
 he was party
 to
some strategies,
 some plan
 or whatever
characterization
 being
 used or qualificatlon
being
 used by the
 Prosecution
 and which
appears
 in
 his
 indictment
 or
 the

 and we are
 saying
 that
 my clj-ent,
indeed,
 took
 office,
 but
 he wasnrt
 abLe to
perform
 the duties
 t.hat go with

If
 you weren't
 able
 to perform
 the
 duties
associated
 with
 your
 office,
 how can anyone
say that
 you are exercising
 authority
 over
your
 subordinates.
 He never
 even met the
officers
 in his
 ministry.
Could you categorically

 of

I don't
 find
 it
 contradictory
 and that's
 why
I am saying
 that
 the
 initiative,
 in
 terms
 of
prosecution
 or
 investigation,
 lies
 with
 the
Prosecution.
 There were other
 members of
Government
 who were ministers
 and they
 are:
not

 M).
client
 was a member of
 Government,
 and
that's
 the
 only
 reason
 why he has been
brought
 here.
Last
 question:
 As from when was your
 client
the adviser
 to
 the
 President?
No; my client
 was never
 an adviser
 to
 the
President.
 He met the
 President
 for
 the
first
 time
 on the
 24Lh of
 May !994,
 just
before
 he took
 oath
 and he was sworn into
offj-ce,
 and he was just
 told
 that
 he would
be sworn in
 the very
 next
 day and that's
 why
I was rather
 surprised
 to
 read
 in
 the
documents given
 to me by the
 Prosecut,ion,

 you look
 at

 material
that
 was even gi,ven to me, there I s no

 Ms. Cond6.
 I will

 appearing
 for
Mugiraneza,
 and, based on a Power of
attorney,
 Mugenzi.
 How much time
 do you

 How much time
 do you need?
MR. GREAVES :
I was contemplating
 how ell-iptical
 I
 could
be in
 answering
 Your Honour's
 question
without
 tying
 myself
 down too
 much to
 a
specific
 amount of
 time;
 I hope about

 If

 I hope you will
forqive
 me.

 of

 cannot

 submission.

to proceed
 and who it
 involves
 has a
significant
 effect
 on the way in
 which the
case is
 prepared
 on both
 sj-des but,
 in
particular,
 by Defence counsel.
 The
importance
 of
 the decision
 is
 this:
 That at
end of
 the
 case after
 your
 deliberations
 it
may be that
 you decide
 that
 either
 or both
of
 the people
 that
 I represent,
 Prosper
Mugiraneza
 and ,Justin
 Mugenzi,
 is
 guilty
 of
one or more offences,
 and you may have to
make your
 minds up whether
 to
 send them to
prison
 for
 long
 periods,
 perhaps
 even for
the rest
 of
 their
 lives.
It, was with
 that. in
 mind that
 I
 listened
carefully
 to
 the
 somewhat cavalier
 approach
of
 the
 Prosecution
 and,
 i-n writing,
 cavalier
approach
 to
 this
 parti-cular
 matter.
 Why do I
say that?
 This
 is
 but
 the
 most recent
 in
 a
series
 of
 similar
 moti-ons that
 have been
placed
 before
 the
 Trial
 Chamber in
 respect
of
 Government ministers.

 that

 was placed

 Wel1, the
 Prosecution
 plainly
changed their
 minds at
 some stage,
 shuffled
t,he cards
 a bit,
 deal-t
 another
 eight
 out
onto
 the
 tabl-e,
 and t.here in
 that
 very
 fact,
we respectfully
 submit,
 you can see quite
clearly
 that
 this
 is
 an ill-considered
 dog's
dinner
 of
 a motion.
 Why do I
 say that?
Wel-L, I'd
 like
 to
 take
 Your Honours through
one or two little
 parts
 of
 the written
motion
 and you will
 see just
 how
iII-considered
 the Prosecution's
 position
is,
 because although
 this
 is
 a motion
designed
 to gather
 in

 in
 the
text
 of

 itself,
 you will

 example,

 if
 I can take

 to
 that
paragraph
 of
 the motion:
 'rThe Prosecution
submits
 that
 based on this
 evi-dence the
persons

 example,
 paragraph
 41-:

 but
that,
 in our submissi-on,
 is

 What is

 Again,
 the
absence of

 of
 what
 should
happen in

 in

 just
 how
iII-considered

 My learned
friend,
 by way of
 concluding
 his
 address
 to
Your Honours this
 morning,
 dismissed
 - you
may think
 in
 short
 phrases
 - the
 problem
 of
accommodation.
 WelI,
 Your Honour,
 "H€

employed by a famous English
 courtesan
 of
the
 L950s.
 He would,
 woul-dn't he, because
he knows it's

 and he wants
to get
 over

 as quickly

 and dismiss
 it
 as simply
 a

 because he knows,

fu11 well
 that
 space is

I'd
 like

 You have to
 decide
 whether
 it
 is
physically
 possible
 to
 try
 eight
 men
together
 and if
 it
 isn't,
 then
 this
 joinde'r
motion
 must fail
 at
 the
 first
 hurdle.
Let
 me move on.
 The Prosecution
 say that
there
 is
 { particular
 relationship
 betweenr
these
 men which
 makes it
 convenient
 for
 threm
to be
 {nd proper
 for
 them to
 be tried
together.
 In essence,
 it
 is
 their
relationship
 as members of
 a provisional
governmen$, which
 existed
 between
 the
 monthrs
of April
 {nd .Tuly of
 1-994 and,
 for
 exampler,
they
 cite
 the
 desirability
 of
 not
 having
witnesses
 giving
 evidence
 more than
 once,
presumably
 on the basis
 that
 the
 witnesses
will
 give
 evidence
 and deal- with
 issues
 that
relate
 to
 the global
 alleged
 conspiracy,
 i.n
particula:f,
 by the
 government
 minisLers.
I pose th{s
 question
 to
 Your Honours because
you might
 like
 to
 invite
 the
 Prosecutor
 tcr
deal
 with
 it:
 What about
 t,he ot,her two
ministers
 who are arrested,

 and

forgiveness
 for
 my appalling
 pronunciatiorr

 They are
 both

 perhaps,
 I have taken
 the
 trouble
 to
get
 their
 indj-ctments
 this
 morning
 ot,
rather,
 some 1egal

 of mine have
very
 carefully
 got
 the
 documents
 for
 me.
The lady

 is

 and j-t's

out
 in
 her indictment
 at paragraph
 4.2:
 At
the
 time
 of
 the
 events

 to
 in
 this
indictment,
 Pauline
 Nyiramasuhuko,
 held
 the
office
 of Minister
 of
 Family

 On
the
 indictment,

Nyiramasuhuko

 Andre

 the
 people
 whom the
Prosecution
 seek to
 join
 in

You may well
 conclude
 that

 to
 the
Government ministers

So, there's
Andre

 paragraph:
 At
 the
time

 referred
 to
 in

 he was the
 minister
 of

and communications
 of

 Andre

 So, Your Honours,
 1et's
 look
 at
this.
 The Prosecution
 say that
 one of
 the
principal
 reasons
 for
 you to
 grant
 their
motion
 is
 so that
 their
 witnesses
 don't
 have
to make repeated
 journeys
 to

this
 indictment.
 If
 what they
 say is
 rigltt
- that
 it
 is
 appropriate
 to
 try
 government:
ministers
 together
 - then
 the
 only
 proper
course,
 w€ would
 submit,
 was to
 apply
 to
have two those
 two as we11.
The fact
 of
 the matter
 is
 they
 haven't
 done
so,
 one suspects,
 because that
 they
 know
that
 trying
 to
 invite
 you to
 try
 10 people
in

 was just
 beyond the

 but because quite
 simply
 there
 isn't

 any real

 in

 They rely
 on
the proposition
 that
 trying
 these
 eight
 men
together
 is
 going
 to
 lead
 to
 saving
 of

multiple

 Your Honour,
 I
 spea}l
from some experience,
 and I hope that
 lrm
not
 thought
 to be boasting
 in
 any wdy,
 but
 I
have been invol-ved
 one of
 the
 trials
 which
is
 detailed
 there.
 The Celebici
 trial,
conduct.ed between March ]-997 and October
Irm sorry,
 November l-998.
 That
 involved
four
 Defendants.
 There
 is
 no doubt
 that
 in
any national
 jurisdiction,
 the more
Defendants
 you have,
 the
 more complicated
 ir
becomes and,
 in
 fact,
 they
 have the
 habit
 of
turning
 int,o
 longer
 trials.
 That
proposit.ion
 doesn't
 change simply
 because
you come before
 an int.ernational
 tribunal.
You,
 inevitably,
 have considerabLe
 increase
in
 the
 amount of
 t,ime which
 is
 taken
 to
 deal
with
 each witness,
 to deal
 with
 each issue
which
 is
 raised
 during
 the
 course
 of
 t,he
triaI,
 and you can see from
 the
 figures
which
 I have set
 out
 in

 the
 length
 of
 some of
 the
 trials
involving
 two or
 three

no guarantee
 of
 shortening
 the
 amount of
court
 time,
 court
 days,
 that
 are going
 to be
needed for
 trying
 these
 men.
The reality
 is
 if
 you have four
 or
 three,
it's
 actually
 a much more digestible
 bite"
Having
 eight
 is
 going
 to be a monster.
Ir11
 tell
 you that
 now, and when we come to
the
 end of
 an eight-man
 trial
 you may, of
course,
 teII
 me that
 I was wrong,
 but
 it
 is,
I telI
 you,
 going
 to be a monster.
 So, it
rea11y
 isnrt
 safe
 to
 say agree with
 the
Prosecution
 that
 they
 are
 right
 in
 that
proposition.
 Those sort
 of
 triaLs
 have the
habit
 of
 turning
 into
 greater
 things
 than
 we
all
 expect.
 The evidence
 is
 there,
 I
submit,
 from the
 figures
 which
 I have set
out
 in
 the
 repIy.
I can update
 you as far
 as one of
 them is
concerned.
 There
 is
 one trial
 which
 is
ongoing.
 It
 is
 the trial
 of
 Kordic
 and
Cerkez.
 That
 is
 going
 to
 go on probably
into
 the New Year,

of
 the Iot.
 Thatrs
 a two-man trial.
So, there
 we look
 at,
 perhaps,
 the
 two most
important
 factors
 that
 my learned
 friend
advances
 in
 his
 arguments
 for
 joining
 these
people
 together.
 If
 we retain
 the
indictmenLs
 as they
 are,
 there
 is
 no reason
why there
 should
 not
 be consistency
 of
treatment.
 There
 is
 no reaaon
 why there
should
 not
 be consistency
 in
 verdict.
 There
is
 no reason
 why the
 proceedings
 shouLd
cease to be transparent.
 There
 is
 no reason
why a proper
 examj-nation
 of
 the
 offences
which
 are alleged
 against
 these
 people
cannot, take place
 in
 a smaller
 tria1.
Of course,
 one of
 the
 things
 the
 Prosecution
is
 seeking
 to
 avoid,
 and they
 make it
 guite
plain
 in
 a blinding
 flash
 of
 honesty,
 is
this:
 ft
 j-s also
 to avoid
 the discrepancies
and inconsistencies
 inevitable
 from
 the
separate
 trial
 of
 joined
 defenders.
 Your
Honour,
 that
 is
 shorthand
 for
 this:

the

 twice.
 That's
 what it
 is
about.
 The Prosecution
 are desperate
 to
avoid
 that
 because my learned
 friend
 knows
only
 too wel-l- that
 it.'s
 going
 to be
extremely
 difficult
 for
 him to get
 his
witnesses
 to do the business
 twice
 running
in
 the

 That's
 what he's
 trying
 to
avoid.
 It
 may be dressed
 up as one thing,

 what it's
 about.

MR. PRESTDENT:
The hearing
 is
 ca1led
 to order.
 Mr.
Prosecutor,
 let
 me remind
 you that
Ms. Veilleux
 submitted
 a motion
 on
inadmissibility
 to which
 you did
 not
 answer
in writing.
 What do you have to
 say about,
that?
MR. FLEMING:
Your Honour,
 if
 it's
 in
 respect
 of
 the
 f i:rst
motion
 which we withdrew.
 So it's
 become a
moot point.
 As to the others,
 I
 can
respond
 in
 kind.
 The other
 motions,
so-ca11ed,
 are not
 in
 fact
 motions
 at
 all
but
 they
 are responses
 to
 our motion
 for
joinder.
 Each one is
 repetitious
 and I,
 for
myself , do not
 want to be seen to be putt:ing
in
 exactly
 the
 same propositions,
 time
 afL,er
time,

yet
 what we find
 we get
 is
 the
 document
dated
 28th of February
 2000, which
 is
 in
respect
 of
 the previous
 motion.
 We didn't:
file
 this
 motion
 until
 sometime in March.
In
 any event,
 it
 became a moot point
 when
Your Honours
 ordered
 that
 we could
 withdraw
the previous
 motion.
 What we find
 in
 this
though,
 is
 a proposition
 which
 is
 entirely
unintelligible,
 a proposition
 that
 our
motion,
 filed
 last
 year,
 was inadmissible
 in
some way.
 I don't
 understand
 the
 1egal
reasoning
 and in
 any event,
 w€ were
 saved
from that
 problem
 by the
 fact
 that
 it
 was
withdrawn.
The balance
 of her motion
 are
 simply
propositions
 in
 response
 to her motions.
 And
I'm
 not
 going
 to answer and clutter
 up this
Court's
 record
 with
 a response
 to
 something
which,
 for
 whatever
 reason
 she chooses
 to
call
 her motion,
 but
 is
 in
 fact
 a response
to mine.
 And my only
 response
 at
 the
 end of
the day is,
 we would be repetitious.

Now, as to
 the more recent
 material,

this:
 There is
 a distressed
 dealing
 with
the
 facts
 of
 the
 case,
 and the
 only
 response
I would
 ever put
 in
 in

 of
 that
 any

 We11, she is

VEILLEUX:
First
 of all,
 the Prosecutor
 underscored
right
 from the beginning
 of
 the hearing
 that
he was speaking
 under
 Article
 48 bis.
 And
now he is
 referring
 to
 48 instead
 of
 48 bis.
When the
 Prosecutor
 wants
 to present
 his
motion
 for
 joinder
 in
 1-9th November,
 he weis
out
 of
 the
 time
 frame.
 He was out
 of
 the
time
 frame
 that
 was prescribed
 and the
Prosecutor
 withdrew
 this
 motion
 and come up
with
 another
 completely
 one on the
 3rd
March.
 We maintained
 our motion
 on it's
inadmissibility,
 Your Honour.
 He withdrew
it
 and came up with
 another
 one to be within
the
 time
 frame of--
 prescribed
 under
 Rule
72.
What is
 very
 important
 as per
 the
 rule
 is
the
 right
 of
 the Accused.

 Ers well
 as

 4 (b) which
 says that,
 all

 have the

 or at
 least
 to

g,uarantees:
 To have the

 and facility--
adequate
 facilities
 for
 the operation
 of
their
 defence
 and to
 communicate
 with
 the
counsel
 of
 their
 right--
 of
 their
 choice.
Your Honour,
 I
 just
 want
 to
 emphasize
 a
certain
 number of points
 regarding
 the
problems
 of
 defence.
 We prepared
 our brief
in
 record
 time.
 Even though
 we left
 Arusha,
had to go back to
 our respective
 countries
and we were tpld
 that
 we had just
 about
flve/ten
 daysi
 otherwise
 we are
 going
 to be
foreclosed.
 Et the defence
 is
 foreclosed.
how then
 can f,he Prosecutor
 respond,
 present
a response
 at
 the
 last
 minute
 and thereby
depriving
 the
 defence
 of
 the
 adequate
 time
to present
 a response?
 Double measures.
And here,
 w€ did
 not
 receive
 a response.
 We
do not
 know what
 submissions
 the
 prosecutor
intends
 to make.
 And, as he did
 say,
 when
we had to present
 our brief,
 it
 is

I might
 add other
 issues
 as we11, Your
Honours,
 because we requested
 the
authorization
 to meet our client.
 We asked
the authorization
 from the
 registry.
Sometimes you have to
 ask,
 you have
 to put,
in

 three/four
 times,
 sometimes
they
 are
 turned
 down such that
 the
 time
 is
running
 and you meet your
 client
 at
 the
 very
last
 minute.
 Particularly
 a1so,
 because we
have to buy our
 own tickets
 and you are
reimbursed
 about
 three/four
 months
 later.
 I
have to buy my ticket
 on a number of
 times
to be here to consult
 with
 my client,
 and
I'm
 sti11
 waiting
 for
 reimbursement.
 So,
where is
 justice?
 How can we say that
everybody
 is
 equal
 before

 Tribunal?

 to

 But
 I wanted
 to make a
request
 and that
 is
 because I don,t
 read
French,
 and there
 are many documentations
if
 counsel,
 you are going
 to make references
to
 the various
 documents you filed,
 I was
going
 to request
 that
 at
 least
 you specify
which
 date
 and what have you,
 so that
 at
least
 I can also
 have time
 when I get
 the
appropriate
 translations,
 to
 fo11ow your
arguments.
 So that's
 exactly
 what I wanted
to asked you of,
 counsel.
 Because so that,
it's
 known exactly
 the
 document you are
referring
 to,
 of
 course.
 fn other
 words,
you identify
 the
 documents
 so that
 it
 can be
followed
 up much later.
 Maybe if
 you want
going
 to read,
 maybe that
 might
 not
 be thei
problem
 I had,
 might
 not
 have arise.
 So
that's
 the
 request
 f wanted
 to make from
you,
 Counsel.
 Thank you.

To assist
 you,
 I'd
 like
 to
 say that

 Not only
 was
this

 not
 presented
 within
 the

frame
 but
 it
 was withdrawn
 on the
 3rd March,
to present
 a new motion,
 such that
 we came
up with
 a brief.
 We had already
 prepared
 a
brief
 on the basis
 of
 the
 first
 one on
inadmissibility,
 and we had to
 come up with
another
 one so as not
 to be foreclosed
 from
submittingl
 on the
 second motion
 presented
 by
the
 Prosecutor.
 And that
 is
 why the
inadmissibility
 in
 1aw is
 in
 reliance
 of
Article
 72. As I
 said
 earlier
 on it
 is
 not
as in
 48 bis
 which applies
 because this
 is
 a
joj-nder
 of
 this
 is

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you,

 Since
 we received
 so
many documents
 from you,

 about

 defects
 which
 is
 not
 what you are

 you to

 to

 how many times
 would
 the
 Prosecutor
amend his

 for
 us to be c1ear,
 to

 can counsel

 And
again,
 w€ are not

MR. PRESIDENT:
She can slow down a little

 that

enough.
 The other
 problem
 is

days following
 disclosure
 by the
 prosecutor
to
 the Defence
 of
 all
 materials
 envisaged
 by
Rule 66 (a) .
 I explained
 earlier
 on that
these
 materials
 were given
 to us on the
 i-6th
of
 September 1999.
The new motion
 for
 a joinder
 by the
Prosecutor
 was on 3rd March 2000,
 and this
was outside
 the
 time
 frame prescribed
 for
 in
Article
 72(a)
 of
 the ru1es.
 The disclosure
of
 the material
 to
 the Accused was done on
16th September 1997.
 Artic1-e
 20 of
 the
Statute
 of
 the Tribunal
 provides
 that
 all
are
 equal
 before
 the
 International
 Criminal
Tribunal
 for
 Rwanda.
 And this
 is
 in
reference
 to Article

 When you respect
 the

 of

 on
which
 the Accused received
 the
 supporting
material
 on 3rd March 2000,
 that
 work up t,o

 which
 again
 extend
 beyond
 the
 t:ime
frame which
 should
 apply
 to
 the
 two parties
as it
 is
 said
 at
 the beginning
 of
 the Ru1e.
The Prosecutor's
 motion
 for
 joinder
 which
was filed
 to the registry
 on 3rd March 2000,
is
 therefore
 inadmissible,
 in
 reliance
 of
Article
 72(a)
 of
 the Rules of

 and
Evidence.
 Prosecutor
 produced
 an indictment
against
 the Accused which
 was presented
 to a
judge
 for
 review.
 Here,
 he intends
 to
 joirr
four
 Accused,
 Casimir
 Bizimungu,

Bicamumpaka, Prosper

 and Justin

 Further,
 following

 motion

 of
Accused,
 we are not

 sure
 of
 the
 other
Accused that
 this

 are
 so many
inconsistencies

 In the Prosecutor's
 motion,
 this
is

 of Accused and not
 a joinder
 of
indictments.
During
 his

 the Accuse<l
refused

due to
 the
 fact
 that
 he has not

 fact
 that

prejudice
 to
 the Accused or
 to
 safegruard
 tLhe
interest
 of
 justice.
These are
 the points
 that
 I have developed
further
 on reglarding
 Rule
 48,
 regarding
 the
interest
 of
 justice
 and serious
 prejudice
 to
the Accused.
 The Accused declares
 that
there
 is
 a conflict
 of
 interest
 in
 joininlg
him to another
 Accused before
 the
 Tribunal,
which
 conflict
 of
 interest
 is
 of
 such a
nature
 as to cause him serious
 prejudice.
Separation
 would
 contribute
 to
 the
 interest
of
 justice--
 severance would contribute
 to
the interest
 of
 justice.
 Besides,
 a joinder
of Accused would bring
 about
 certain
procedural
 problems
 which
 would
 delay
 the
trial
 and therefore,
 the prolongation
 of
 the
detention,
 which again
 is
 a serious
prejudice
 to the Accused.
The Prosecutor
 states
 in
 paragraph
 72 of ,his
second motion
 that
 the
 joint
 trial
 of
 the
Accused could
 be held
 very
 much faster
 than
a separate
 trial
 if
 even if
 all
 of
 them are
together,
 it
 is
 shorter
 than
 one Accused.

THE INTERPRETER:
Your Honour,
 he's
 reading

There are
 certain
 --
 we have a serious
problem
 here.
 Counsel
 is
 reading
 the
document which

Standard

 requires
 that

 should
 have a document,
 go

 to
 the interest
 of
 justice.
 To
raise
 the
 fact
 that
 there
 are
 ten persons
and not
 eight
 anymore,
 especially,
 since
 the
Prosecution

to know who exactly

The Prosecutor
 is
 talking
 about
 the
existence
 of

 facts
and that
 a joinder
 of Accused would
contribute
 to avoid
 contradictions
 betwee:n

 But
 the

J6r6me Clement
 Bicamumpaka is
 concerned,
there
 is
 no relation
 of
 the
 facts
 mentioned
by the Prosecutor.
The only
 fact
 raised
 by the
 Prosecutor
 is
the one of Witness 2F, 55,
 69, who states
 in
paragraph
 5.2t,
 supporting
 material
 which
,J6r6me Clement
 Bicamumpaka spent
 most of
 his
time,
 if
 not,
 all
 his
 time
 abroad.
 That is
during
 the period
 from April
 to July
 1994.
To support
 his
 allegations
 of
 5.2 of
 the
indictment,
 the
 Prosecutor
 talks
 about
 a
letter
 dated
 3 December 1-993, addressed
 to
the
 commander by officers
 of
 the
 UNAIvIIR,
copies
 of which
 were addressed
 to
 the
 former
ministers,
 Casimir
 Bizimungu,
 Prosper
Mugiraneza
 and .fustin
 Mugenzi.
 He
arbitrarily
 adds the
 name of
 J6r6me Clement
Bicamumpaka.
 In December 1-993, .f6r6me
Clement
 Bicamumpaka was not
 a member of
 the
government.
 The Accused is
 requesting
 that
his
 name should
 be deleted

 that
 that

 paragraph
 should
 be
withdrawn

In paragraph
 5.1 of
 the
 indictment,
 the
Prosecutor
 could
 carefully
 add the name o:E
the
 Accused
 to
 that
 of
 twelve
 Rwandan
personalities
 whom he charges
 of having
organized
 a plan
 with
 the aim of
exterminating
 the Tutsi
 population
 and
eliminating
 members of
 the
 opposition.
 He
doesn't
 supply
 any witness
 to
 other
 forms
 of
proof
 that
 this
 Accused is
 guilty
 of
 these
crimes.
 The Accused is
 therefore
 requesting
that
 his
 name should
 be withdrawn
 from
 that
paragraph
 and also
 from
 the
 indictment.
In paragraph
 5.2 to
 5.7,
 the Prosecutor
accuses
 a number of people
 of
 having
 made
speeches
 inciting
 hatred
 and ethnic
 violence
which
 constitutes
 an important
 element
 of
the plan
 that
 was set
 up.
 To prove
 these
charges,
 the
 Prosecutor
 bases himself
 on the
testimony
 of Alison
 Des Forges
 and on a
letter
 from the--
 of Bureau G-2 of
 the
headquarters
 of

 army.
 But neither

In paragraph
 5.8
 of

 indictment,
 the
Prosecutor
 talks
 about
 Tutsis
 being
 the
enemies and this
 description
 was supposed to
be used by Mugenzi.
 The Prosecutor

states
 that
 Justin
 Mugenzi,
 Eliezer
Niyitegeka
 preached
 about
 ethnic
 differences

 mentions
 the presence
 of
 the
Accused in
 all
 these meetings.
 Neither
 do
they
 show the
 role
 that
 the Accused played

 this.
 The Prosecutor,

 As far
 as he is
 concerned,

 The killing
 of

made the

 Nations.
 The Prosecutor,
bases himself
 on the
 evidence
 from Luc
Marchal
 and Lieutenant
 Nees,
 does not
mention
 the name of
 the Accused.
 More so,
because the killing
 of
 the Belgian
 blue
helmets
 took place
 before
 the
 Interim
Government was set
 up on the
 9th
 of April,
1994.
 The same is
 true

 the
Prosecutor

 accusing

Justin

 Interahamwe,
 of

 According
 to him,

 enemy and its
 accomplices
and distributed
 weapons to
 them.
 There
 is
also
 a question
 of

 the prefets
as early

 The Prosecutor
 talked
about
 ministers
 who approved
 the plan
 for
extermination,
 but
 does not
 mention
 the name
of
 the Accused.
 He was out
 of
 Rwanda for
almost
 the

 month of
 April
 1,994, and
he did
 not
 take
 part
 in
 convening

 The Prosecutor
 bases his

In paragraph

 the
Prosecutor
 talks
 about
 the

 including
 the prefet
 of

 because
 they
 refused

 He bases his

 that
 in

 in
 a

 None of

because he did
 not participate
 in

 In the

As you are

 as the

 we reaLise
 that
 the

 joinder
 is
 done together
 with
 Minister
 of

 other
 political
 parties.
 Different
7
 political
 parties.
 There were three
I
 interim
 sovernments
 one in
 1992, one in
9
 L993, and one in
 l-994.
 The ministers
 who
t_0
 were in
 the governments
 of

1l-
 were not
 necessarily
 the
 same who were
1,2
 appointed
 9th April,
 L994 which
 brings
 on

 difference,
 and in
 1'994 there
 was an
L4
 attempt
 to
 apply
 the Arusha
 Accords.

 There was this
 attempt
 and this
 is
 why it
16
 was decided
 to

 it

f explained
 in
 fact
 is
 that
 the
 fact
 that
this
 government
 was different
 with
from
 by people
 from various
 political
parties,
 means that
 the
 Prosecutor
 shouLd
be able
 to
 say together
 with
 who in
 which
government,
 is
 it, the
 government, of
 92,
93,
 94 and who were those
 who planned
 the
genocide,
 that
 was not
 done in
 the
indictment
 and so we do not
 know exactly
what to respond to and that's
 why I
 am
taking
 each one of
 the points
 of
 the
indictmenLs
 because this
 joinder
 is
 going
to bring
 together
 people
 that
 the Accused
does not
 know. He knows only
 two people
t,hat
 is
 from
 the
 MDR but
 he does not
 know
the others.
 So, how can we then
 join
indict.ments
 where we see in
 the
supporting
 material
 that
 there
 are
 no
witnesses
 who are going
 to
 come to
testify.
 So, the evidence
 is
 not
 the
same.
 So, where is
 the
 linkage,
 and then
some clarification

exactly

 he is
 deprived
 of

prepare
 his
 defence,
 particularly
 since
he sti1l
 does not
 know the

 The Accused does
not
 have a full
 defence
 because he is
 not
informed
 of
 the
 exact
 nature
 of
 the
charges
 brought
 against
 him and no
witnesses.
 So, these are just
approximate
 charges,
 joinders
 are made

 other

 are
 added and
during
 all

 the

 is
not

 15 Months of
 detention
 exactly
 what
the
 charqes
 are and that
 is
 an abuse on

 the Accused of

that

 emotj-ons that

 point

view,

 there

 which
 your

 Tribunal'
 your
very
 Chamber has taken
 war on in
 all
 the
decisions.
 In fact
 in
 July,
 1'999, the
Prosecutor
 presented
 a joinder
 for
 13
accused persons
 after
 the
 original
 of
 28
which was reiect.ed
 or dismissed
 on 24th of
February
 in
 the year
 2000,
 that
 motion
 as
withdrawn
 because it
 was impossible
 to
practically
 implement
 it
 but
 that
 not
withstanding
 it
 was deemed reasonable
 to
mai-ntain
 for
 ten
 members of
 the
 members of
government.
And then on the 24Lh of
 March,
 2000, there
was a new vision
 of globularization
 for
 B
and these
 gradual- movement to
 unfloor
 this
a clear
 thought
 to
 ensure
 that
 through
 a
col-lective
 meeting,
 the
 job
 of
 demonst,rating
indlvidual
 responsibility
 is
 facilitated.
That
 is
 a point
 of vi-ew that
 I understand
 as
far
 as the
 Prosecutor
 is
 concerned
 but
 that
I would not
 understand
 in
 the
 case of
 the
Tribunal.
The joinder
 is
 grounded on Rule
 48; persons
accused of
 the
 same or different
 crimes

It
 is
 therefore
 necessary
 to prove
 an act
which
 is
 part
 of
 a plan
 or a strategy,
 a
scheme or
 strategy
 in
 the
 course
 of
 a
transaction
 and vour
 Tribunal
 will
 no doul:t
recognize
 that
 this
 concept
 of
 transactj-on,
the

 is
 the basis
 of
 the
joinder
 if
 it

 to

personal
 participation
 to
 an offence
 which
is

It
 is
 on the other
 hand absolutely
 necessary
to prove
 that
 each and everyone
 of
 them here
present
 including
 Edouard Karemera acted
t.ogether
 in
 the
 same transaction.
That is,
 within
 a scheme or a strategy
 with
a view to
 committing

 such a broadening

approving
 the

 would
allow
 a leeway for
 globularizatj-on
 and
unclear
 globularization
 by the
 Prosecutor
 in
respect
 of

 taken
individuallv.
The approach
 against
 globularization
 made in
your
 judgment here,
 r€-iterated
 in
 the

 of

 would be paradoxical
not

 it
 woul-d be t.he height
 of
paradox that
 after

 state
 clearly
what the
 charges
 were looking
 at
 the
indictment,
 we should
 base ourselves
 on the
same charges
 to
 justify

 So Lhe
Prosecutor
 needs t.o provide
 minimum proof
beyond reasonable
 doubt
 of
 the
 criminal
transaction,
 that
 is
 the
 conspiracy
 in
 or,Cer
to justify
 the joinder.
And I understand
 the
 difficulty
 and the
courage
 too which

al-1 the
 paragraphs
 in
 the
 indictments
 and
all
 this
 had a simple
 purpose
 which
 is
 mine
too
 here
 to
 show the
 absence of
participation
 in
 a criminal
 transaction.
 So
the
 absence of
 a nexus between her
 client
and the
 rest
 of
 t.he clients
 within
 a
criminal
 transaction
 and I woul-d be tempted
as far
 as I am concerned
 not
 to
 list
 all
these
 but
 to brinq
 out
 a number of
 them to
describe
 a criminal
 transaction
 when the
Prosecutor
 vj-gorously
 introduces
 his
indictment
 in paragraph
 5.1- and where we
read a number of
 people
 including
 Edouard
Karemera from the end of
 1990 to
 L994
conspired
 to draw up a plan
 with
 the
j-ntention
 of
 exterminating
 the
 civilian
Tutsi,
 the
 civilian
 population
 and
 to
el-iminate
 the people
 in
 power.
We no longer
 understand
 paragraph
 5.2 which
rai-ses
 t.he fact
 that.
 in
 a lett.er
 dated
December 1993, Officers
 of

to
 the

Does that
 imply
 that, there
 were two plans
 or
just
 one plan?
 Why these
 differences
between the
 plans
 of
 one group
 and the
other?
It
 would have been desirable
 that
 the
Prosecutor
 should
 st,op at
 only
 one version
and definitely
 we have no explanation
 on the
plan
 which
 is
 or scheme which
 is
 finally
given,
 chosen.
Another example in paragraph
 5.L4 to
 5.35,
if
 I remember weII,
 the
 role
 of
 Mr.
 Karamera
in
 developing
 t,he young
 Interahamwe
militiamen,
 at
 least
 in
 the Prosecutorrs
version,
 Lhe pivotal
 or crucj-aI
 role
 in
 this
planning
 is
 ment,ioned.
If
 we look
 at
 the
 support.ing
 material
pertaining
 to
 the crucial
 role
 of
 the
Interahamwe militia,
 I don't
 think
 t,hat I
saw even one line,
 not
 even one word
concerning
 Edouard Karamera.
So all- we have to
 saY is
 that
 as Vice
President
 of
 the MRND, he had authority.

beyond reasonable
 doubt
 of
 participation
 in
criminal,
 in
 a criminal
 transaction
 and in
 a
scheme or a strategy
 and 1ts
 execution.
When we realize
 that
 the Minister
 of
Interior
 at
 the arrival
 of
 the
 Interim
Government,
 he was only
 appointed
 to
 the
government on the
 25 May of
 L994, that
 is
when it
 would
 appear
 that
 he is
 being
 made:
one of
 the
 brains
 of
 the
 organization
 and
that
 the
 fact
 that
 he was Vice
 President
 of
the MRND. He is
 proof
 of
 his
 active
 role
 in
the planning
 particularly
 as concerns
 the
Int.erahamwe militia.
This
 deduction
 as far
 as I am concerned
 is
 a
cavalier
 deduction.
 In
 fact
 as far
 as I am
concerned,
 it
 is
 almost
 frivolous.
Under the
 circumstances
 when this
 Tribunal
reads Articles
 6.5,
 massacres perpetrated
 as
wel-l- as the
 strategy
 prepared
 and executecl
by the political
 leaders
 including
 Edouard
Karemera who conspired
 to
 exterminate
 the
Tutsi
 population
 as from the
 7th of April,
he joined
 the government
 only
 the
 27t'h of
May, the
 25L1n of May, I beg your
 pardon.
There again
 this
 is

which
 is
 not permitted
 in

Criminal
 Courtroom.
To quote
 another
 cardinal
 point
 of
participation
 in
 the
 criminal
 transaction
where Mr.
 Karemera is
 being
 accused
 of
havinq
 aided
 and abetted
 the
 massacres
during
 the public
 meetings
 at
 the
 very
beginning
 of
 the
 month of
 May --
 Apri1,
 w€
omit
 to
 recall-
 once again
 at
 that
 point
 that
he was not
 yet
 a member of
 government
 but
 he
is
 being
 attributed
 with
 having
 aided
 and
abetted
 this
 or that
 behaviour
 as a
politician.
 It
 is
 understandabl-e
 but
 in
 the
indictment
 when we refer
 to his
 capacity
 as
a member of government,
 that
 is
 totally
incomprehensible
 .
Generally
 speaking,
 this
 Tribunal
 is
 faced
with
 the demanding difficulty
 of
 defining
 a
criminal
 transaction
 and we have to
 st.art
through
 the
 surrounding
 in
 order
 to
 get
 to
cracks
 of
 the

 is
 clear
 thaL
this

 cannot

 on a certain
number of principles
 ment.ioned by the

 which
 concern

sometimes and very
 often

 directly,

far
 as his
 alleged
 participation
 is
concerned.
This
 minimum requirement,
 if
 we look
 at
Article
 6.1 of
 the Statute
 which this
Tribunal
 knows better
 than
 me recalls
 one of
the general
 PrinciPles
 of
 Iaw,
 the
requirement
 of Personal
 criminal
responsibilit,Y.
That
 requirement
 in
 l-aw requires
 that
 true
clear
 and physicallY
 Proven facts,
participation
 or
 involvement
 in
 a criminal-
transaction
 or
 scheme with
 a view
 to
genocide
 is
 Proven.
 That
 is
 and the
requirement
 that
 this
 Tribunal-
 stated
 very
clearly
 as far
 as stating
 clearly
 and
individualizing
 the
 charges
 are
 concerned,
holds
 true
 to
 the

 as far
 as

 of
 the
 is
 basic
 condition
for

 the

 in

is
 concerned.
The collect.ive

 the bunched trials
can only
 have a severely
 meaning,

meaninq if

would suffice
 to bring
 out
 other
justifications
 put
 forth
 by the
 Prosecutor:
on how practical
 these
 col-lective
 or bunch
process
 is
 concerned.
My learned
 colleague,
 Mr. Grieaves,
 said
that
 some people
 might
 have to
 sit
 on the
carpet.
 He is
 right
 to
 talk
 about
 how slow
the
 proceedings
 would become starting
 with
the
 fact
 that
 even if
 we suppose that
 these
accused persons
 are
 sentenced
 for
 quite
 a
while,
 they
 are waiting
 and they
 are patj-ent
durinq
 the trial
 but
 this
 doesn't
 tie
 in
with
 their
 presumption
 of
 innocence
 and I
woul-d like
 to
 add in
 the
 end.
I would like
 to add that
 if
 the
 Prosecutor
in
 support
 of
 these
 charges
 in
 the
indictment
 has qrounds
 to
 which
 we have not
been given
 access yet
 for
 reasons
 we could
be just.ified
 pertaining
 to
 the protection
 of
witnesses,
 pertaining
 perhaps
 also
 to
 the
protection
 of
 certain
 victims
 or
 rel-atives
of victims.
 There
 is
 no doubt
 t.hat
 in
 the
absence of
 open access to
 such material,

can only

at
 the

 and you would
 have noticed
 as l-ar
as Edouard Karemera is
 concerned
 that
 either
he is
 not
 concerned
 or he is
 indirectly
concerned or
 lastly
 if
 he is
 concerned,
 h<l
is
 not
 in
 manner that
 would
 incriminate
 h:Lm
but
 al-so and I remember that
 one of
 the

 talked

 Edouard Karemera

 persons
 to behave properly

 that
 that
 to
 me is
 not
 a
vocabulary
 that
 in
 any waY can be
interpreted
 since
 I know that
 there
 is
 a
special
 lexicon
 of genocide
 that
 would ask
him to
 support.
At
 this
 time,
 that
 is
 what we think
 about
this
 request
 for
 motion
 for

 which
 is
not

 because
 it
 has the

defects

motion
 of
 the

 You tried
 to
 show
that
 that
 request
 for
 joinder
 was without
merit,
 unfounded.
 Maybe you overlooked,
looking
 at
 the
 content
 say of
 the
 linkage
 or
a nexus or the
 indivisibility
 aspect
 that
should
 appear
 in
 any request
 for
 joinder,
coul-d you be clear
 as to
 in
 Your
arguments
 or your
 submissions
 on these
aspects?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr.
 Skornicki
 has the
 floor.
MR. SKORNICKI:
Thank You,
 Your Honour.
 ,Judge Guney has put
a question
 Lo me with
 respect
 to
 the
 corner
stone aspects of
 joinder,
 of
 a joinder
namely
 the
 nexus or
 the
 linkage
 and the
indivisibility
 of
 the said
 joinder.
 Well
beyond the whole
 concept
 of
 a criminal-
transacLion,
 you do have,
 I believe
 the
answer to Your question.
If
 there
 is
 a criminal
 transaction,
 there
 is
indivisibility
 or at, Lhe very
 least
 a
linkage
 or nexus.
 If
 there
 is
 no crimina.L
EransacLi-on,
 a common scheme, I
 find
difficult,y
 in perceiving

 I wish

 to your
 if
you al1ow me to
 speak because we have indeed
checked as a matter
 of
 conscience
 because
this

 I did
 tel1
 you that
 we agreed
that
 is,
 with
 the parties
 incl-uding
 Ms.

 lengt.hy

because not
 everyone
 was avallabIe

 However,
 we did

 on the

 the
 30th,
 your

 did
 not
 appear
 here
 today
 as has

 has not

 from your

 on her

 circumstances,
 w€ shall
 confine
ourselves
 to her written

 and if
 I am

 you.
 I dontt
 have any

 point
 in

 from Ms.

 but
 the
 very
 last
communication
 that
 I have from her
 last
Friday,
 she said
 she would
 try
 to
 appear
 at

 further
 tried
 to
 check
whether

 there

 In any case,

 was no new

 nothing

 She filed

FLEMING:
PETRUSCHIJARIRAThank you,
 Your Honour.
 Can we make some
general
 propositions
 which
 woul-d be
applicable
 to at
 l-east three
 of
 the
submissions.
First
 this
 proceeding
 is
 not
 a review
 of
 the
indictment
 and at
 l-easL one of
 the
 parties
wanted to make it
 so.
Second, it
 is
 no a trial
 on the merits
 and
at
 least
 three
 of
 the parties
 wanted to make
it
 a trial
 on the merits.
Third,
 this
 applicatj-on
 is
 based upon the
indictment,
 the application
 j-s based upon
the
 indictment
 and the
 limited
 material-
 that
was supplied,
 there
 is
 no need to
 go beyond
that.
Fourth,
 the
 indictments
 must show a prima
facie
 case.
 That has been established
 in
every
 instance
 by the
 confirming
 Judge.
Fifth,
 all
 periods
 for
 preliminary
 motions
have passed.
 There is
 one preliminary
motion
 still
 pending
 in
 the matt.er of Mr.
Karemera.
 I think
 I am right
 in
 saying
 that
Mr.

There has been no successful-
 attack
 on the
form of
 the
 indictment's
 in
 any of
 those
preliminary
 motions
 and the
 indictments
stand
 as theY are.
Sixth,
 there
 are no applications
 that
 have
been made by any party
 here
 for
 further
particularit,y
 in
 respect
 of
 any of
 t'he
indictments.
Seventh,
 the
 assessment
 of
 whether
 or not
 a
joinder
 should
 take
 place
 is
 based upon
prima
 facie
 case in
 every
 instance
 shown on
the
 indictment.
In that
 case,
 in
 that
 instance
 then,
 there
is
 evidence
 in
 every
 case to
 establish
 the
j oinder .
In respect
 of
 the
 evidence
 itself,
 there
have been comments today
 suggesting,
 and I
do not
 want to
 do a disservice
 to
 anybody,
suggesting
 that
 proof
 is
 beyond reasonabl-e
doubt
 and then
 a attempting
 to
 translate
proof
 beyond reasonabfe
 doubt
 in
 this
present
 transaction
 and with
 t,he greatest
respect
 that
 canrt
 occur.
In respect
 of
 the
 indictment.s
 themselves,
there
 has been much said
 about
 whether

 be in

 from all
 of
 the
facts.
 Those matters
 of
 course
 await
 trial,
whether
 or not
 we make out
 a case at
 triaL

 another
 matter
 altogether.

 respect,
 it's
 our
submission
 that
 that's
 not
 the
 standard
 that
applies
 here.
 The standard
 that
 applies
 hclre
is
 whether
 or not
 a prima

 case is
being
 made out
 in
 respect
 of
 each accused

 on the
 material
 there

 there
 is

 a

 that
 it
 has.

Your Honours,
 then
 specifically
 to
 each of
the
 submissions,
 whenever we mention
 the
government
 indictments
 or
 the
 fact
 the
people,
 the
 accused are members of
 the
Interim
 Government,
 therets
 an immediate
reaction
 to
 say that
 they
 are
 indicted
 upon
that
 basis.
W€, of
 course,
 don't
 say that
 they
 are
indicted
 because they
 are members of
 the
government.
 We say that
 the
 common link
 for
the
 law is
 that
 they
 were members of
 the
government
 and all
 that
 flowed
 from
 that
their
 responsibility
 J-n government
 and so on
and so on as is
 well- set
 out
 in
 the
indictment.
So we are not
 at
 all- basing
 the
 commonality,
the
 common purpose,
 the
 common intention
 or
however you might
 like
 to put
 it,
 the
community of purpose
 upon the
 fact
 that
 they
were simply
 members of
 an interim
 government
but
 rather
 on all
 that
 qoes with
 that.
My learned
 friend
 from Greaves,
 raised
 a
number of
 interesting
 issues.
 He said
 that:
because of
 the
 errors
 he was able
 to point
out
 in
 our mat.erial,
 it

We would submit
 that
 it's
 still
 appropriaf-e
that
 all
 people
 should
 be joined
 as we have
suggested.
 He raised
 the
 spectre
 of
 Mr.
Kambanda being
 given
 a tria1,
 and what
 shall
we then do?
 May we wait
 and see?
 We're

 T, quiEe
frankly,
 said

 if

 time

people
 came within
 the
 ambit
 of
 the
 sorts
 of
offences
 that
 we have pleaded
 against
 these
accused,
 then we would give
 consj-deration
 to
joining.
 Not something,
 of
 course,
 that
 we
can do by ourselves;
 it
 would still
 depend
upon your
 Honours'
 determination
 whether
 or
not
 we could
 join.
 So we make no promise
not
 to bring
 any applications
 to
 join.
However,
 whether
 they
 succeed or
 not
 is
another
 thing
 entirely.
 May I
 say,
definitely,
 w€, at
 this
 stage,
 have no
intention
 of bringing
 such applications,

properly
 mount an argument
 that
 in
 the
interest
 of
 just,ice
 and al-l the other
requirements,
 then we may well
 bring
 an
application
 to
 this
 Trial
 Chamber.
 But of
course,
 it
 is
 a matter
 ultimately
 for
 this
TriaL
 Chamber on whether
 it
 would be
convenient
 to hear
 such a person.
One thing
 that
 did
 become apparent
 in
 most
of
 the
 submissions
 is
 the
 absence of
 any
real
 attack
 upon the
 lega1
 basis
 of
 our
application.
 There are many at.tacks
 upon
the practicality
 of
 it,
 but
 on the
 actuaL
legality
 of
 it,
 there
 are very
 few attacks.
Our l-earned friend,
 Mr.
 Skornicki,
 attempted
to mount an attack,
 and wit,h the
 greatest
respect,
 w€ would submit, that
 it
 wasnrt
 a
sufficient
 attack
 to
 overcome the
 problems
that
 are
 faced
 by the Accused
 1n these
cases.
Mr.

 suggested
 that

in

 cases,

 respect,

 argument

 many more times,
 ancl
might
 I reply
 in
 kind
 that
 that,
 of
 course,
is
 exactly
 what every
 defence
 counsel
 would
love
 to have happen to
 every
 witness.
 But,
that
 isn't
 the basis
 of
 any plea
 t,hat we
make in respect
 of
 the witnesses.
 It's
 in
respect
 of
 their
 welfare
 that
 we ask that
the
 number of
 times
 that
 they
 come to
 court
be limited.
 My l-earned friend,
 Mr. Greaves,
was also
 advocating
 that
 the
 present
indictments
 stay
 as they
 are,
 in
 effect.
What he advocates
 is
 a trial
 much larger
than
 the present
 trial
 than
 the
 present'
proposed
 joinder.
 To be fair
 to
 him I must
add that
 it
 wouldn't
 be in
 respect
 of
 his
client
 because his
 client
 is
 one of
 four.
However,
 if
 his
 argument
 is
 to
 ho1d,
 then
 he
is
 rea1Iy
 saying
 we don't
 mind that, you have
a trial
 of
 a greater
 number than
 eight
 in
and of a triaI.
May we then
 come to

 they

therefore
May we spend a moment on Rul-e 72 to
 see
precisely
 what it
 says and subparagraph
 (A):
motions
 by either
 party
 shall-
"Preliminary
be brought
 within
 30 days following
disclosure
 by the

 no definition
then

 on the

 is.
 Having
 said
preliminary
 motions
 by either

 it
 then
goes on in
 (B) to define
 what a preliminary
motion
 by an accused
 is.
 There
 are
objections
 to
 lack
 of
 jurisdiction,
 defects
in
 the
 form of

 May we go to
(iii)
 :
 I'Applications
 for

 trials
 under Rule 82 (B) ".
And then
 iv,
 "Objectj-ons
 based on denial
 of

 for
 assignment
 of

We can only
 say that
 to
 define
 what a
preliminary
 motion
 is
 on the
 part
 of

 can be argued
 only
 by analogy.

And this
 isn't
 analogous
 to
 any of
 those
which
 are defined
 as preliminary
 motions
 by
an accused.
 I paused at
 (iii)
 because it
 at
first
 glance
 might
 have some applicatj-on,
but
 (iii)
 refers
 t,o applications
 for
severance
 of
 crimes
 joined
 in
 the
 one
indictment
 under Rule
 49.
 W€, of
 course,
arenrt
 operating
 here
 in
 respect
 of
 the
severance,
 ot,
 to use the
 converse,
 the
joinder
 of
 crimes
 in
 one indictment.
 Werre
not
 seeking
 to do that
 at
 all.
 So we don't
fatl
 within
 the converse of
 Rule 72(B) (iii).
Itts
 our submission,
 in
 fact,
 that
 this

 a preliminary
 motion

preliminary
 motion;
 therefore,
 anything
 that
our
 learned
 friend
 has said
 is
 inapplicab-Le.
And I note
 that
 none of
 the
 other
 l-earned
counsel
 in
 any of
 the
 cases,
 the
 1l- cases,'
have identified
 this
 as a point
 that
 they
ought
 to
 take;
 not
 that
 I
 can claim
 that
 as
a defence.
 I might
 only
 be saying
 that
 none
of
 them were able
 to
 identify
 it
 as a point,
but
 that's
 un1ikeIy.
 It
 isn't
 a preliminary
motion,
 and therefore,
 there
 is
 no validity
whatsoever
 in
 what was said
 on behalf
 of
Mr. Bicamumpaka.
Still
 in
 respect
 of
 those
 submissj-ons,
 there
was an attempt
 to
 review
 the
 indictment.
 I
have already
 made comments about
 that .
 If,
in
 fact,
 she got
 if
 Mr.
 Bicamumpaka got
 a
separate
 trial,
 that
 separate
 trial-
 would
stil-l
 be upon the
 indictment
 that
 was being
so stridently
 criticized.
 So, the
application
 of
 her
 argument
 to
 the
indictment
 has no practical
 effect
 at
 the
end of
 the
 day outside
 of

motion
 for
 defects

 some

 Mr.
 Bicamumpaka has
had his
 day in
 court
 in
 respect
 of
 the
defects
 in
 the

 Might
 I also
 add
that
 the
 concatenation
 of motions,
 the
building
 one upon the

 of

so that
 it
 becomes a larger

 in

is
 an unacceptable
 way of

 And we ask your

 carefully
 at
 the manner in
 which

motions
 have been dealt
 with
 before

 for
 perhaps
 some comments from
 your

 some actj-ons
 by your

Whatever
 eLse our

 was doing,
she was certainly
 wanting

 show down.
 Thank you,
 your
 Honour.
Your Honour,
 can I
 finally
 deal
 then
 with
the
 submissions
 of Mr.
 Skornicki.
Mr.
 Karemera was the
 Minister
 for
 the
InLerior,
 and as such,
 he was responsible
for
 internal
 order,
 and he was also
responsible
 for
 civil
 defence.
 We would
submit
 that
 on any view
 of
 the
 indictment
there
 is
 plenty
 of materlal
 to
 show that
 Mr.
Karemera's
 rol-e either
 worked wonderfully
that's
 an unfortunate
 term
 in
 the
circumstances
 in
 respect
 of
 the massacres
or alternatively,
 it
 failed
 appa11ingly.
 In
either
 case,
 he will
 bear
 the
 responsibitity
for
 that
 role.
 My learned
 friend
 said
 that
there
 was very
 little
 chance
 no,
 Irm
sorry.
 I
 shoul-dn't
 misquote
 him,
 although
 I
am working
 from the
 translation.
 So please
forgive
 me if
 r do happen to misquote.
 "The
chances of
 the
 l-ocal
 truth
 coming out
 is
very
 difficult".

One of
 the
 advantages
 in
 working
 within
 the
discipline
 that
 we are here
 is
 that
 we get
the best
 of both worlds.
 We get
 the best
 of
the
 common law system;
 we get
 best
 of
 the
adversarj-al
 system.
 It
 has been said
 of
 the
common 1aw system by the
 adversaria]
 system,
that
 sometimes the
 truth
 doesnrt
 come out,
necessarily.
 Those of us who defend
 that
system,
 of
 course,
 refute
 that.
 On the
other
 hand,
 in
 the
 civil
 system,
 Your
Honours play
 a more active
 role.
 So despite
my failing
 or perhaps
 the
 failings
 of
everybody
 else
 in
 the
 courtroom,
 your
Honours will
 stil-I
 play
 a larger
 part
 in
 a
trial
 than
 that
 t,o which
 I have become
accustomed.
Your Honours will
 ensure
 as,
 of
 course,
 is
your
 responsibility,
 that
 everyone
individual
 who's
 joined
 within
 an indictment
will
 be guaranteed
 the
 rights
 of
 an
individual.
 Just
 because they
 are joined
doesn't
 mean that
 they
 lose
 their
 rights.
And just
 because they
 are joined,
 it
 doesn't
mean that
 the
 truth
 may not
 come out.

Your Honour,
 ,fudge Seku1e,
 I must come back
to
 something.
 It
 wasn't
 until
 afterwards
that
 I realized
 the basis
 of
 your
 questiort
in
 respect
 of
 48bis.
 f note
 that
Mr. Skornicki,
 my learned
 friend,
 said
 that
we were basing
 this
 upon Rule 48,
 and of
course,
 he can be forgiven
 of
 being
 of
 that
view because that's
 what the motion
 itseLf
said,
 the motion
 filed
 some considerabLe
time
 ago.
 However,
 there
 has been debate
that, last
 time,
 and today
 in
 respect
 of
 Rule
48bis,
 I understand
 what your
 Honour was
actually
 asking
 me this
 morning.
 And I want
to
 spend but
 a moment in
 respect
 of
 that.
Can we say that
 there
 were confirmed
indictments
 of people
 jointly
 charged
 and
Rule 48 applies?
 Each person
 has their
rj-ght
 guaranteed
 by Rule
 82 (A) .
 And then
the
 joinder
 of
 indictments
 as distinct
 from
individuals
 is
 deal-t with
 by Rule
 48bis,
which was, of
 course,
 introduced
 as a result
of
 problems
 found,
 I
 think,
 in
 one of
 the
applications,
 one of
 the
 motions
 brought
 .in

 If
 itrs
 necessary
 to
 rely
 upoll
Rule 48 to
 say that
 we simply
 want these
people tried
 together,
 then we do so.
 Itrs
probably
 easier
 to
 deal- with
 it
 pursuant
 Lo
Rule
 48bis
 because there
 are
 confirmed
indictments,
 and it's
 an application,
 or at
least
 the
 application
 of

simply

 indictments
 rather
 than

 Thank you,
 your
 Honours.
 They
are our submissions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
 We have now heard
 the
Prosecutorrs
 submission
 and response
 from
Defence.
 I guess we will
 end there.
 But if
there
 are further
 clarifications
 being
sought
 by Defence,
 they
 could
 do so.
Please be more specific,
 more focused.
Mr. Greaves.
MR. GREAVES :
I had hoped I had been reasonably
 focused
this
 morning.
 But if
 I wasntt,
 I beg your
Honourts
 forgiveness.

to ask him if
 he'd be so kind
 as to clarify
it.
 He said
 this:
 r r W ed o n o t
 say they
 ar:e
indicted
 as members of
 the
 governmentrr.
 Clan
I ask him to clarify
 this:
 Does he sdy,
thereby,
 the
 mere voluntary
 and conditionerl
membership
 of
 the
 government
 is
 not
 enougtt
to
 find
 criminal
 liability
 in
 respect
 of
 any
count?
 I brought
 a couple
 of
 other
 thingsl
 I
just
 want to mention,
 but
 that
 one in
particular
 I think
 he needs to
 respond
 to
immediately.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you want to
 answer on that
 specific
point,
 Prosecutor?
MR. FLEMING:
Thank you,
 your
 Honour.
 We'lI
 reply
 upon
the prima

 case that
 has already
 been

MR. GREAVES :
Your Honour,
 the
 other
 matter
 is
 simply
this,
 and it
 is
 a matter
 simply
 for
 the
record.

 Defence?
Anyone else?
 Nobody.
I think

 We

 Ms. Vej-Ileux,
 I did

 No, no.

 It

 Mr. Greaves did

Mr. Skornicki
 said
 no.
 Please,

 WelI,
 Mr.

there
 is
 a general

 matter
 that
I want to

 that, does not
 concern

motion,
 but
 it
 is
 a matter
 of
 some
j-mportance
 to me, and I don't
 want your
Honours
 to
 leave
 without
 my having
 had an
opportunity
 to
 raise
 it,.
 It
 is
 not
 a matEer
that

 this

 at

 it
 :ls
an important
 matter.
 And as I understood,
your

 I

 me an opportunity
 to
 raise
 that
particular
 matter.
 I'm

 your

MR. PRESIDENT:
So when you talk
 about
 housekeeping,
 what
has that
 got
 to
 do with
 the
 motion?
 We are
here
 for
 the motion.
 Maybe you should
report
 to
 the Registry
 if
 it
 is
 a
housekeeping
 matter.
MR. GREAVES :
It's
 a matter
 that
 is
 the
 fault
 of
 the
Registry.
 I'm
 not
 going
 to go to
 the
Registry
 to
 remedy their
 fault.
 I am going
to
 ask you to
 order
 them to
 do something.

Ms. Veill-eux.
MS. VEILLEIIX:
Now, in view
 of
 the
 fact
 that
 this
 morning
 I
did
 raise
 an objection,
 according
 to which
we did
 not
 receive
 the
 Prosecutorrs
response,
 I
 st.ilI
 stand
 by my objection,
your
 Honours.
 And since
 the
 Prosecutor
 has
rel-ied
 on 48 and 72, these
 are matters
 that
have been canvassed
 by a motion,
 I would
have wanted
 to
 respond,
 or
 at
 l-east
 have t,he
same time
 as t.he Prosecutor.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, Do, there
 j-s no dispute.
 I
 told
 you
this
 morning,
 w€ have heard
 your
 arguments.
If
 you feel
 that
 the
 Prosecutor
 has assenLed
or
 acquiesced
 by virtue
 of
 the
 fact
 that
 he
has not
 responded in writing,
 we11, thatrs
f i-ne.
 We will
 l-ook at
 it .
Mr.
 Greaves,
 ,Judge Sekule
 would
 like
 to get
some cl-arifications,
 why you think
 you
shouLd go through
 the
 Chamber.
MR. GREAVES :
Itts
 simply
 this:
 It
 needn't

Numerous motions
 have been filed
 in
 respe,ct
of
 the
 indict.ment
 which
 my client
 faces,
which
 have never
 been served
 on co-accused.
Those motions
 may well
 touch
 or
 affect
 thre
rights
 of
 the
 co-accused,
 and it
 may be
and I am not
 saying
 that
 this
 has happenerl
yet.
 It
 may be that
 a motion
 is
 filed
 by
Defendant
 No. l- with
 which
 procedure
Defendant
 No. 2 violently
 disagrees
 and does
not
 accept.
 If
 we are not
 given
 notice
 o:E
those motions
 filed
 by other
 co-accused,
 r^re
are,
 therefore,
 prevented
 from exercising
our
 rights
 to
 object
 to whatever
 procedure
is
 being
 requested
 by the
 co-accused.
 And I
am simply
 asking
 that
 an order
 be made
and I don't
 think
 t,hat this
 wilL
 find
 any
opposition
 from the
 Prosecution
 an order
be made that
 when a motion
 is
 filed
 by a
defendant
 it
 should
 be served
 on all
parties,
 so that
 they
 may have an
opportunity
 properly
 to make such
observations
 as they
 are
 advised.
PRESIDENT:
I wish
 to
 say t.o Mr.
 Greaves
 that
 what he
has just
 said
 had been raised
 in

 that

 has

 in

 case.

No, rro, no.
 It
