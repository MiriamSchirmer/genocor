MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, the 8th of May 2008, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

The appearances are the same.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness, is that any better? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, I can hear you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, your testimony will continue this morning.  I remind you that you remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began yesterday, and you'll have to respond to the Prosecutor, who will now have an opportunity to put some questions to you.  
MR. NIMY:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  Excuse me, Mr. President -- Mr. President?  

I would like to express a concern on our part.  There are more increasingly persistent rumours regarding the situation of Witness BTH who, it would seem, has disappeared.  We called this witness in our case.  He testified here and I remember that he placed emphasis on concerns regarding his security.  And, today, it seems to me that it would be normal for us to be interested in what has happened to him.  

Mr. President, if you have more information on this subject, could you please communicate such information to us, subject, of course, to confidentiality which will be attached to the investigation on the situation of the witness.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, I can assure you that we are no less concerned than you are on this issue.  We were considering whether we should require the Registrar to report to the Chamber.  And in light of the submissions you have made, we have taken the view that we ought to require a report, which will be made available to the parties when we receive it.  
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. N'dow, are you ready to proceed? 
MR. N'DOW:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may.
ILDEPHONSE MUNYESHYAKA (continued),
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.  

Mr. Witness, in your testimony yesterday you stated you had a lengthy and distinguished career in the Rwandan diplomatic service.  Can you tell us what led to your resignation from the government diplomatic service? 
A.	Thank you.  I would like to have your name.  
Q.	My name is Mr. Saidou N'dow.  I'm a trial -- an assistant trial attorney in the office of the OTP, and I was called to the English bar and the Gambian bar.  I hope you're satisfied.  
A.	Yes.  Yesterday I underscored the reasons which led to my resignation.  For me, that was the only way in which I could follow, without any obligation, the fact -- the principle that a civil servant should fulfil his obligations -- his duties, and it is up to a civil servant to abide by certain rules and regulations.  

This is a principle of civil service.  I told myself that by withdrawing from the civil service, I would be free.  I would be free to observe, to criticise, to give advice, to describe.  That is why I resigned.  
I resigned so that I could be free in order to monitor the problems of my country and to play that role -- when it seemed to me it would be useful to do that -- when my country was going through a very special phase in its history.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Did there come a stage when you disagreed with the government's policies? 
A.	Yes, when I saw that there was a situation which needed a rapid response, I tried to intervene.  I tried to meet a leader and to tell him, "This is my point of view."  If you want, I can give you an example.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, with all due respect, I just want you to tell this Court which policies of the government you disagreed with.  
A.	Could you please repeat your question, because I didn't quite grasp what you meant?  
Q.	You just said that you disagreed with some of the policies of the government.  Can you tell us which of the policies you disagreed with? 
A.	When the multiparty political system was introduced, there was a need to open doors so that other parties could play a role.  You see, what I did is that, with friends, we met, and we sought to meet President Habyarimana.  President Habyarimana received us and we conveyed to him our concerns.  
I believe the prime minister at that time was Nsanzimana.  Nsanzimana is spelt N-S-A-N-Z-I-M-A-N-A.  
We told the president that he should agree that other parties join his government, and we were not the only ones to do that.  There were other sources of pressure.  So MDR joined the government.  That was -- this is an example of one occasion on which I expressed my opinion.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, is it not the case that you resigned from the government because you believed that the government did not correspond with your ideology of peace, justice and equality? 
A.	With regard to justice and peace, those were not the reasons for my resignation.  It was not because there was no peace that I resigned.  There was peace and there was justice, but there was this political side, which really was a cause for concern as far as I'm concerned -- I was concerned.  Otherwise, the country was functioning normally.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, is it safe to conclude that you did not agree with the Habyarimana government because you believed it was an extremist government? 
A.	Well, Mr. Saidou -- is that your name?  The word extremism labelled or tagged on Habyarimana's government is a word which I reject, because Habyarimana was a man and a head of state whom I knew.  And I can say that as far as he was concerned, I never ever noticed any tendency towards extremism.  And, if you allow me - and, of course, with the leave of the President, I emphasised yesterday the fact that that man, by installing the policy of peace and dignity, he did -- he did so because he had not experienced the repression by the monarchy.  He was from the north where Tutsis were not many in number.  

I always say that mountains give birth and the valleys also give birth.  This means that the place where we are born has an impact on us in a subconscious manner, and we absorb elements which fall on us, which come from all directions.  President Habyarimana did not experience the weight of the Tutsi regime.  Of course, he was living in Rwanda, but he was not born in areas where people met those Tutsis, and therefore, he did not develop any extremist tendency.  

So he was a man who was at ease in the midst of Tutsis.  I could give an example, but it will take long.  So if he were -- if he was at ease with Tutsis, how could he have been an extremist?  Against whom?  Against Hutus?  Against whom?  I saw him. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, but did he like the idea of sharing power with the Tutsis? 
A.	You mean, Hutus sharing power with Tutsis, is that what you mean? 
Q.	Yes, Mr. Witness.  
A.	On which period do you want me to focus in the history of Rwanda?  
Q.	That is during your incumbency as an ambassador. 
A.	Sharing power with Tutsis, it is true that I do have some blame to apportion.  First and foremost, I would like to tell you that in the policy of peace and unity, Tutsis had occupied almost the entire economic sector.  You had Valence Kajeguhakwa, who had a monopoly of the importation of fuel.  Kajeguhakwa is spelt K-A-J-E-G-U-H-A-K-W-A.  

Kajeguhakwa monopolised the import of fuel.  The major companies were owned by Tutsis, and there were many of them; I cannot mention them.  In government, Tutsis were present; however, what I regret is that at that time I wished that there could have been more representation of Tutsis.  However, Tutsis were not absent from government.  

So it is in -- with that regard that I told the president that he should open the doors to -- leading to politics and he agreed with me.  Tutsis had a significant weight in the economy and he told me: 
"He who holds the purse, also controls politics."  Isn't it the case that today, it is the economy which is the most influential sector?  Tell me -- tell me, if you don't have the purse, so to speak, how can you function? 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Mr. Witness, after your resignation from the government, you joined two organisations.  Mr. Witness, did you write any articles that were critical of the government? 
A.	I wrote and in my writings -- and, actually, there were communiqués or announcements -- so what we used to do is that we would submit the communiqués to the government and to the United Nations representative who, at that time, was Roméo Dallaire, who was based in Kigali.  

We would submit our communiqués to Karenzi Karake, who was the representative of the RPF.  And our criticisms were actually made when we saw that there was a stalemate.  And I'd forgotten to say that we also informed our opinion -- we informed political leaders and all concerned parties of our opinion regarding what we thought were the dangers facing the country, and what were the solutions that we proposed.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, were you at any time prosecuted by the government because of these writings? 
A.	Prosecuted?  No.  However, you're now giving me the opportunity of saying here what was happening at that time.  There were rumours.  There was disinformation -- and, as far as I am concerned, maybe to scare me, they would tell me:  "Your name is on the list earmarked for -- earmarked to be killed.  This is what the Interahamwes are doing."  So -- but I would answer them and tell them:  "Bring me the list or lists."  But no one gave me such a list.  
But people were taking advantage of a situation, which was conducive to rumours, in order to spread lies.  Otherwise, I was never ever threatened or persecuted, apart from the rumours which were spreading.  So I had the feeling that there were people who deliberately wanted to destabilise individuals by telling them:  "Look, you're being threatened."  That was said to me, but that did not prevent me from doing what I wanted to do.  I never ever saw any evidence of what was being said.  
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, are you saying that you never received death threats? 
A.	By whom? 
Q.	Did you receive death threats or not? 
A.	But I've just told you that they were rumours, false rumours.  For there to be a threat, it must really emanate from a source that you fear so that you are concerned that the -- anxious in case the strike might actually materialise.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, did your name figure in a list of people to be eliminated at any stage? 
A.	As I said, apart from the rumours, I told the people, who were informing me that was on the -- I was on a list.  No one showed me the list on which my name allegedly was -- if there was any document, it would either be fabricated or -- but, at the time in Kigali, I sought out that list and never obtained it.  
I never saw it.  
Q.	But, Mr. Witness, did you believe in those rumours? 
A.	At the outset, I thought:  "Well, maybe it's possible."  And I went on trying to obtain information, and when I was convinced that it was just rumours, I no longer paid any attention to it.  But, at the outset, 
I thought, "Well, perhaps it's possible."  So I was a bit careful because the insecurity of which I spoke yesterday, there was insecurity.  But if someone tells you, "You're also under threat", at the outset, you believe it --  
Q.	Mr. Witness -- 
A.	-- but after checking -- 
Q.	-- in 2003, did you believe that you were on the list of people selected for elimination? 
A.	In 2003 -- 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Excuse me, Witness.  

Mr. President, should we not point out to the Prosecutor that for the last five minutes we've been going around in circles.  He's answered in every way possible that -- the Prosecutor's question, because it's the same question that's -- we're being hammered with for the last five minutes.  So perhaps we could move forward.  
MR. N'DOW:
We'll surely move forward, Ms. Diagne.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you claim political asylum in Belgium? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Did you complete an asylum questionnaire in Belgium? 
A.	Yesterday I did state that I was granted political asylum in Spain.  And from Spain I went to Belgium with my status as a Spanish refugee -- as a refugee in Spain.  That is all.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have not answered my question.  Did you complete an asylum questionnaire in Belgium? 
A.	What form?  What questionnaire?  Because when I arrived in Belgium, I already had refugee status, but, of course, I had to fulfil the conditions whereby my file could be transferred.  That's what Belgium requested of me.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, maybe I should remind you.  What I have with me here is an asylum questionnaire that you filled in in Belgium.  What is your comment? 
A.	Dated when? 
MR. N'DOW:
Mr. President, with the assistance of the registry, if I could just hand him -- the witness, this document?  If I could -- for the parties -- 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President --
MR. NIMY:
Forgive me, Mr. President, because we did not receive this document beforehand, so we couldn't read it through to know exactly the contents.  

I should like to ask the Prosecutor, who's distributing the documents now, whether it's a document concerning the transfer of a file, or is it a request to obtain from Belgium refugee status?  I don't have the document, which is why I'm putting the question to the Prosecutor.  
MR. N'DOW:
Mr. President, I'm just handing in -- the documents, which I intend to use in cross-examination of this witness, was actually being photocopied --
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Monsieur le Président -- 
MR. N'DOW:
-- and we had experienced difficulties with the photocopier this morning.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, we would have seen everything in this trial.  In the middle of the cross-examination of the witness, as the cross-examination is taking place, after one hour of cross-examination, we are given a bundle of documents intended for use in that self same cross-examination.  Of course, mention will be made of difficulties in photocopying.  

I think my colleagues should make the request that I'm now making, which is that we should suspend the cross-examination so as to peruse the documents my learned friend says he intends to use in the cross-examination.  And then we can resume when the Defence teams feel they are sufficiently familiar with the documents the Prosecutor intends to use in the cross-examination.  So there must be some remedy to the method just used by the Prosecutor.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I feel that my learned friend Dior Diagne is extremely indulgent with the Prosecutor when she presumes good faith.  One can always presume good faith.  But, Mr. President, you handed down a ruling requiring the Prosecution to hand in all the documents relating to witnesses to appear.  

A few days ago, we received a CD on which were documents concerning this witness inter alia, and there was one document.  So I would like to assume good faith on the part of the Prosecutor, but this communication one hour after the cross-examination has begun, is it in good faith or is it in bad faith, 
in violation of your ruling?  We should like to know.  And the Prosecutor should tell us when he received these documents.  Since when have they been holding them?  And is this withholding information in violation of your ruling, Mr. President?  I find this extremely unfortunate.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, whatever ensues, I have just quickly glanced through the documents used to question the witness.  And knowing the situation somewhat in Belgium and the method of obtain -- it's quite clearly a request for transfer of file.  In any case, we shall --  
MR. N'DOW:
(Microphones overlapping)...if he can ask the witness to take off the headphones.  

Mr. President, these documents -- especially immigration documents, were actually disclosed on the 25th of April.  This is not the first time that we've brought these documents.  They were disclosed to the Defence on or about the 25th of April 2008.  What we haven't done is we haven't presented these documents this morning.  And my explanation for that is the fact that we experienced difficulties with our photocopier this morning.  But the documents had been disclosed very much in time.  

Mr. President, I'm sure you will agree with me that this is a standard practice, and we have done -- the Defence has done this on several occasions when they presented documents to the Court for cross-examination in the mornings.  

But to respond to my -- to -- to the Defence's queries, these documents were disclosed well in advance.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We do not think that this constitutes a ground for the suspension of the cross-examination.  

Mr. N'dow, I don't think this is or should be standard practice in my courtroom, so I expect that these disclosures are made when they should be.  Please continue.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Forgive me, Counsel N'dow, I should like to speak to the President.  

I have heard your ruling and I should like to ask you how we're going to proceed with the documents just disclosed to us to be able to follow the Prosecutor's cross-examination?  Do you think we should just do without it?  Or do you think after the Prosecutor's cross-examination there will then be a suspension so we can prepare redirect?  Or shall we just forget the fact that we've just obtained these documents?  

It's so that I might just fully understand your ruling and, of course, in all humility and respect.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, the practice that we have accepted is that when cross-examination commences, then the party cross-examining will disclose the documents to be used in cross-examination.  For obvious reasons, it's not practical or reasonable that that disclosure should be made before the cross-examination commences.  

So counsel who conducts the examination-in-chief would always be in the position of receiving that information at that stage.  The critical issue was whether notice of this document had been given previously, and it has not been challenged that service was made prior to this witness coming into the witness box.  

So we would have concluded that the only rule issue that's been breached is the rule of courtesy, basically, because Mr. N'dow could have told us that this was a problem when we began, and we would expect that the exchange of documents takes place at the time when the cross-examination is due to commence.  But we don't think that there's been any -- any element of this matter which would have an impact on the ability of counsel who conduct the examination-in-chief at this time.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, forgive me, please don't think I'm trying to have a dialogue with the Bench, but what has been violated is more than just courtesy.  You see, we work this close, but very tardily.  But that's not serious; that's not what I'm really driving at.  But we received documents totalling a thousand pages.  

Now, for the other party, the question is to know what the questioning or the cross-examination will bear on so that we might prepare ourselves.  Now, a disclosure of a thousand pages on the 25th of April for examination-in-chief -- or redirect to take place a week later, it's not a rule of courtesy that has been violated, but it's a way of trial by ambush again because that is, indeed, what happened.  
When one has to undertake a task, what is the reason for which disclosure takes place?  You even told us to do it in electronic form before examination-in-chief or cross-examination.  But, what is the point of doing it beforehand?  It's not a question of courtesy; it's a question of organisation of our work, of preparation and we have not been able to do that, and I thought it should be stated clearly.  
MR. N'DOW:
Mr. President, shall I continue with my cross-examination? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. N'dow, you may proceed.  
MR. N'DOW:
Thank you, Your Honour.  

With the assistance of the registry, can the immigration document number 5 -- the immigration questionnaire completed by the witness -- be placed before the witness.  
MS. NGOWI:  
He has the document.  
MR. N'DOW:
He has the document.  Thank you.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, does this document ring a bell? 
A.	Naturally, it reminds me of something.  
Q.	Now, let me turn to page 12 of the document, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And, Mr. Witness, can you see your signature in the middle of this document? 
A.	Yes, I can see it.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you agree that everything you stated in this questionnaire is true? 
A.	Quite so.  It is truthful.  
Q.	Now -- now, Mr. Witness, turning to page 8 of the said document, under the heading of persécutions, page 8.  
A.	Yes, I'm there.  
Q.	Under persécutions, menaces de mort? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Threat of death", says the Prosecutor.
THE WITNESS:
Yes?

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Answers the witness.
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Did you not testify yesterday that you did not receive any death threats? 
A.	That is what I told you.  There were rumours, and in my questionnaire in Spain I mentioned that.  So later in this questionnaire reference is made to -- to the time when I left the country in order to seek refuge, and this was not something light, otherwise I would've been in Kigali.  So I was referring to that.  I left my country because I was not in security.  That is what I meant.  
Q.	Let's -- let's look at the document further, Mr. Witness.  
In the section D, you put, "1992 to 1994".  And où, you said, "Kigali".  And par qui -- that is, from whom you received the death threats and you said, "The government of Habyarimana and P -- FPL".  And you were -- you were asked, pourquoi.  You said:  "Because of my writings in Kinyamateka, in which I criticise their politics and extremism and exclusion."  And then it goes on.  In the circumstances, you said, "My name" -- "My name figured in the list of persons to be eliminated -- to be exterminated." 

Mr. Witness, is this not what you wrote in that particular questionnaire about the reasons why you were seeking political asylum in Belgium? 
A.	No, I have to make it clear that I did not seek political asylum in Belgium.  My document -- my dossier was transferred to Belgium -- and Mr. Nimy said that.  What I wanted to say was this -- and let me repeat:  Initially, or at the outset, I received information to the effect that I was on the list, and I said, and I repeat, that initially I was careful.  I cross-checked the rumours and it was only when I persistently questioned the people who gave me such information, and continued verifying the information that I finally found out they were just rumours.  And the reason I mentioned them here is that that is what I went through, step by step, I went through that.  
Q.	But you said in your testimony that in 2003 -- you believed in 2003 that these were just rumours.  
Did you say that today? 
A.	2003 refers to the country where I was.  I had left my country.  I did not leave my country willingly and with a light heart.  I felt that I was threatened.  I cannot return to my country today because the threat still hangs over me, Mr. Saidou N'dow.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, this questionnaire is dated 28th of November 2003, and when you completed it, you did say that you received death threats, which totally contradicts what you have stated this morning.  Is that true or not?  
A.	I do not know where you're going to, Mr. Saidou.  I wrote and I declared starting and going through everything I lived through, step by step, up to today I'm giving you a skim of my journey.  From that time till now when did I see this?  When did I notice this?  And I write down what I saw or heard at various times.  

Those false rumours at the time were received by -- by me.  I counterchecked them, and by so doing I did not believe that they were founded -- and I've written this.  But when I left my country in -- in order to seek asylum, there was a reason for leaving my country, and I was being threatened.  Even yesterday I said that when I take a decision, I know that it entails a risk. But I have the feeling that you're trying to look for something other than what I've said.  And if the President so wishes, I'm ready to continue along these lines, but I don't think that will lead to anything.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, moving on, in the questionnaire you attach a page -- a hand-written account of the reasons for -- your reasons for seeking political asylum.  Can you see that, where you wrote a whole page? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, in the third paragraph, you said:  
"I began my articles which were published in a semimonthly Kinyamateka.  These articles contain advices (sic), but also criticisms towards the Habyarimana government and the FPR (inaudible)...coming from Rwanda" -- "through Uganda" --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could counsel -- Mr. President, could counsel use the microphone when reading out?  Thank you, sir.  
MR. N'DOW:
My apologies.
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	You said your article contains criticisms against the Habyarimana government.  
A.	Yes, yes, and the RPF as well as leaders of political parties.  
Q.	And you said that your articles were appreciated neither by the Habyarimana government nor the FPR, is that correct? 
A.	Yes, to a certain point.  
Q.	And you said you could criticise, which is contrary to what you said this morning, you said you criticised especially the attitude of the extremist and exclusive policy which you observed in the intentions of the two governments.  Is that what you said -- you wrote? 
A.	Exclusion?  No, that's too much.  What I was writing and what I blamed politicians, including the government, the RPF and other political parties -- well, I was blaming them for their attitude of being rigid in respect of the opposition.  And according to me, I wanted there to be efforts so that we create a space in the middle where minds would meet, so those were my criticisms.  

You see, in my training when I was a student, I learnt to criticise authors in order to understand what they were writing -- in order to desiccate what they were writing, in order to understand the reason and the thinking of a writer.  So when I see anyone do something -- let's take an example of politics.  I observe what they are doing, I observe what they're saying and then I give them my opinion -- that is criticism.  So in my writings, if I thought that people should come together, find common ground; that is what I did.  That's what I've always done and if I have the opportunity of doing so today, I would do so surely.
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you write -- in your own writings -- that you criticised the attitude and the extremism and exclusive policies of the government.  Did you write -- 
A.	Of exclusion?  Of extremism?  Well, in my analysis I could have used such words by saying that, 
"You are drifting off from the path leading to common ground.  You're leaving the middle ground."  I could have used those words.  
MR. N'DOW:
Mr. President, I seek to tender these documents into evidence, the immigration record, pages 1 to 12.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  

The number, please.  
MS. NGOWI: 
That will be P. 313, Your Honours.  Thank you.  
(Exhibit No.  P. 313 admitted)
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you agree that there was a large-scale killing of Tutsis in Rwanda in April 1994? 
A.	Wide-spread killings of Tutsis?  Yes, there were killings.  Tutsis were killed because they were Tutsis; Hutus were killed because they were Hutus.  Rwanda bled.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Mr. Witness, in your testimony yesterday you mentioned that the killing of President Habyarimana was the cause of unrest that followed the country.  Mr. Witness, do you think it was justifiable for the massacres of innocent Tutsis to follow the president's death? 
A.	Please repeat your question because there's something amiss.  There's something I didn't quite grasp.  
Q.	Okay.  Mr. Witness, in your testimony yesterday you mentioned that the killing of President Habyarimana was the cause of the unrest that followed the country in -- in 1994.  And I'm asking you, do you think it was justifiable for the massacres of innocent Tutsis to follow the president's death? 
A.	You are saying that I testified that the president was assassinated because of unrest?  Is that what you're saying?  Because of unrest -- is that what you're saying?  He was assassinated because of unrest?  I would like you to clarify this portion. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, what I said was that you mentioned that the killing of President Habyarimana was followed by unrest.  Did you say that yesterday? 
A.	Yes, yes, the killing of President Habyarimana was, indeed, followed by widespread massacres -- and this is something which I condemn -- I condemn the killings.  However, at the same time I added and specified the fact that the murderers, who dared what the devil could not have dared do, committed an act of evil and they caused the entire nation to explode.  That is something I said and that is something I meant.  Knowing that there was tension created by the war, the assassins worsened the tension -- the existing tension, Mr. Saidou.  Any -- tell me, can anyone who was really responsible have done that?  
Q.	Mr. Witness, that is my next question:  What motivated these killings? 
A.	We will look at this at length, and just like I will -- as long as you persist in asking me that question, I'll answer you.  Can you please remind me of your question?  Did you say, what motivated what? 
Q.	The killings.  
A.	Look, you -- you carry out an act knowing that there are consequences to that act.  You plan something and you implement something.  The planner draws up a dangerous plan, and subsequently the results of such a dangerous plan are catastrophic consequences.  That is -- wasn't that what the assassins wanted?  They should be charged on that and that is what the Rwandan people are looking for.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Mr. Witness, coming now to another section -- issue.  Mr. Witness, in your testimony yesterday you stated that there were no Interahamwe in Kibuye.  I just want you to clarify one thing.  Do you mean that there were no Interahamwe in the whole of Kibuye -- that is, including all the communes? 
A.	I gave an example of what -- or, rather, of how the word Interahamwe was coined and how it was spread.  I gave you the example of Prince Antoine Nyetera, who was called an Interahamwe when he went to Europe to testify in the Ntuyahaga -- in the Ntuyahaga trial.  I gave you an example of Nyetera's case, you -- you must remember that.  

And, I also said that at meetings and at rallies people were invited to those meetings and rallies.  Young people, old people would attend those rallies and meetings and they would listen to the speakers.  And my observation was that those young people would be invited to meetings of different parties, and they would attend the meetings of the various parties.  

So this gives you a clear picture of the fact that those young people were navigating between several existing parties, so they were not organised.  If they had been organised, I would have noticed that.  I would have said a certain number of those youths were in MRND, a certain number were in MDR, but they were navigating between the various parties and that -- that is what I saw and that is what I'm telling you.  
Q.	(Microphone not activated)...are you saying -- are you saying, Mr. Witness, that there was not any organisation called Interahamwe?  Is that what you're saying? 
A.	When multiparty politics were introduced to Rwanda, political parties organised themselves.  I don't remember exactly, but I believe that it was PSD -- which was the first time to talk about a youth 
wing (sic) -- a party youth wing.  And, I also believe that along the way, the MRND did the same thing and other parties followed suite and gave names to youths who had joined their parties.  

The MRND gave the name -- gave that name to the youths of MRND.  And then I heard some false rumours, because at that time there was an atmosphere which led some people -- or people to fight against the party which had monopolised power.  So other parties were saying:  "Look, the MRND has a youth wing called Interahamwe."  There were even people who said that those youths were being trained, but where?  They said, "Nowhere."

One day, I was taking a stroll in Kigali and I saw three young people who were in a -- somehow unusual attire and I was told:  "These are Interahamwes."  But I only saw three young men.  So I'm describing to you what I saw and what I heard as well as the rumours circulating at that time.  And when the tragedy hit our country, there were massacres.  

The international media and people who were trying to blame all the evil acts on MRND said:  
"The Interahamwes were the perpetrators of all evil acts."  There were even media which said that it were Hutu extremists who had killed President Habyarimana.  Do you believe that? 
Do you really believe that?

1030H 
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can I suggest to you that in Kibuye there was an organised body of youths called Interahamwe?  I suggest that to you, and what is your comment? 
A.	I did not see such an organisation.  Organised?  No, I saw what I have already described to you; I mean, people who were navigating between the various political parties at the time.  
MR. N'DOW:
Mr. President, I am not sure whether this would be a convenient time to take the mid-morning break.
MR. PRESIDENT:
About how much more time do you think you have? 
MR. N'DOW:
Mr. President, about an hour; slightly more than an hour.  I would have finished had it not been for the objections, Mr. President.  But, at least an hour, slightly more than an hour.  One hour 15 minutes, at the most.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take our mid-morning recess now.  
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
Mr. President, just a moment, please, before you rise.  

In honour of my undertaking yesterday, I have to hand a copy of the cassette to support the documents I was trying to move into evidence.  So if -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you shown it to Defence Counsel?  
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
I have a copy, another copy.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you already discussed it with Defence Counsel?
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
I didn't think I needed to, Mr. President.  I am sorry.  

Should I have given it to them so that they could listen to it?  Is that what you are suggesting, sir?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I suppose we should just take your word for everything.  
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
Well, I didn't burn it, Mr. President.  It went through the usual channels, from IUSS.  If you prefer, I could -- 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, it would probably save some objection time, as I just clarified before.  But, maybe they don't object to it.  So -- but that's -- 
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
I am going to take it that they accept that I am being honourable in the presentation.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
I will make a copy available to them, nonetheless, so that if they choose, they can listen to it.  So, that is for the Defence.  That is for the registry.  They would be marked, therefore, Mr. President, P. 14.  
I suggest A for the cassette, B for the French, and C for the English. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, the Prosecutor is trying to force things.  Yesterday this document was presented.  There were objections.  The Trial Chamber wanted the CD, but there is a cover page.  We do not know who wrote the cover page or a preamble.  I suppose it was written by the OTP.  We want to know who, what's the provenance of the document and who wrote the preamble or the cover page, who wrote those comments?  How can we enter into evidence such a thing when we don't have all the information.  Just giving half a document and a CD-ROM, and giving them exhibit numbers is not something that is sufficient.  We need to have the information pertaining to provenance.
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I would also like to add that apart from the well-founded objection by 
Counsel Dior Diagne, there is the issue of listening to the CD-ROM.  I want to know whether it was a programme in Kinyarwanda, French or English.  How it was transcribed, how it was translated, the issue remains.  So, let us first wait to have the CD-ROM before a ruling is made.  
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
I didn't anticipate that this would have taken so long, Mr. President.  Frankly, the transcripts of cassettes have been admitted into evidence in this case in a number of instances, without all this fanfare and this requirement for cassettes and authentication of who wrote the cover page and all of that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor. 
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take the mid-morning recess and see what happens when we resume.  
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
Very well.  
(Court recessed from 1037H to 1107H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We continue.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness --
MR. N'DOW:
With the assistance of the registry, can my document number 1 in my list of documents be placed before the witness? 

Your Honours, this document had already been admitted into evidence as P. 12.  

Sorry, Your Honours.  It is the tape that is in evidence.  It is not the document.  It actually is the tape, following corrections from my learned friend.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, the document placed in front of you is a radio transcript of an MRND meeting held in Ruhengeri on the 7th of November 1992.  

Another point of correction.  It is a radio transcript of an MRND meeting held in Kigali on the 
7th of November 1993.  Can you see that?  I want you to look at the French text.  Can you see the French text? 
A.	I am looking for it.  Yes. 
Q.	And can you kindly go to page 18 of the French text?
MR. N'DOW:
For English speakers, it is page 12.  It is the third paragraph on page 12.
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, the paragraph beginning -- the third paragraph beginning:  "I would now like to call upon Interahamwe brothers from Kibuye to come closer."  Have you seen that?  It's the penultimate paragraph of page 18, the penultimate in the French text.  The penultimate paragraph of page 18, the French text.  The penultimate paragraph of page 18, the French text, Mr. Witness, beginning with (French spoken), the paragraph before the last of page 18.  

And, Mr. Witness, if I could read that to you quickly.  "I would now like to call upon Interahamwe brothers from Kibuye to come closer.  They came to meet us, but their -- beside -- this is -- coincided with this rally."  And that was Robert Kajuga, the national president of the Interahamwe, speaking.  Have you seen that? 
A.	Yes, I am reading it.  But what do you want me to do?  What is your question?  
Q.	I am moving on to that.  The next paragraph beginning with "The president of the Interahamwe", it is the president of the Interahamwe in Kibuye speaking.  The second paragraph, and it reads:  "In Kibuye we have instituted the Interahamwe movement right throughout the cellules, the secteurs and the communes.  In each of those entities we have an Interahamwe committee.  The Interahamwe comprised youths whom we recruited basing (sic) on their good conduct and behaviour."

Mr. Witness, this was a radio transcript of a meeting held by the MRND, in which it is acknowledging the presence of the Interahamwe.  And also we have the president of the MRND stating that they have established the MRND in all the communes, cellules and secteurs of Kibuye.  What do you say to that?
A.	This is my answer.
MR. WEYL:
I am sorry, Witness.  

Mr. President, maybe there is a translation problem, or maybe there is a problem in the way the Prosecutor read out this passage.  But I don't see how we should take the sentence saying, "There is also the MRND president who says."  This is what I see on the CaseView.  
MR. N'DOW:
I will rectify this.  Maybe it is a problem of translation.  
MR. MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, this was the president of the Interahamwe in Kibuye, saying -- acknowledging the fact that it was established in all cellules, communes and secteurs.  What do you say to this, Mr. Witness? 
A.	My answer is as follows, and I will tell you what I saw and what I lived through.  At meetings, at rallies, young people were invited, and in specific cases, young men, and although I was not present at that meeting referred to here, a young person would speak and make such a comment, make a comment which you have just read out.  Why?  To draw attention, to boost his image, to be acknowledged there and then.  So, because of these reasons, a young person could have made such a statement.  But what I saw is that -- how can you interrupt me, Prosecutor?
Q.	Just answer my question, and I want to proceed to the next question.  
A.	No.  No, Mr. President, I am sorry.  I was expressing myself and I was interrupted, and he just took a part which suits him, which satisfies him.  I have not finished.  I was a witness.  I was a witness to the circumstances.  And, normally, I will not accept this sort of interruption because I was speaking when I was interrupted.  

So, Mr. President, I seek your protection so that I can complete my answer.
Q.	Mr. Witness, if you misunderstood my intervention, it was not intentionally, and I apologise for that.  Anyway, we proceed.  
Mr. Witness -- 
A.	So I was on the point of explaining to the Court what I saw and what I experienced, and this is what I experienced.  In my travel, in my movement I saw distinctive signs of the various parties.  Young people had all the signs and insignias of their parties, MRND, MDR.  In other parties, youths had the signs.  That is why I said that those young people were navigating between the various parties, wearing the party signs according to their party in question and the organisation of the party, whereas on another day, the same young people would wear the signs and colours of another party.  So what I want to say here is that an organisation and membership, in the way you are trying to assert, did not exist.  

Young people were moving between parties at meetings.  How, why shouldn't the youth of Kibuye take advantage of travel costs to go to Ruhengeri wearing MRND colours.  If a meeting was organised in Butare, young people would be invited and they would go there wearing, for instance, PSD colours and signs.  That is what I saw.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you --
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, the witness's answer is clear.  However, I would like to go back to my earlier rectification because the Prosecutor is not reading out from the document which he mentions.  He is trying to attribute to this document the fact that MRND's president had said some things.  He then corrected himself by attributing the comments to the president of the Interahamwe.  

And, once again, this is false, because if you read the document disclosed to us, you will see that there was an individual speaking, not Interahamwe's president.  I think that the answer which has been given by the witness is very enlightening.  But the question asked by the Prosecutor is erroneous and the subsequent rectification was also erroneous.  

For the record, it was not MRND's chairman or Interahamwe's president who was speaking at that time.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, the documents which we have indicate that the main speaker was Kajuga, who was the national president of the Interahamwe.  And at one stage he invited an Interahamwe speaker from Kibuye who spoke.  So the speech contained statements by Robert Kajuga, as well as an Interahamwe speaker.  That's how I saw it.  So, I think Mr. Prosecutor can continue.  
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Mr. President.  But for the record, when the Prosecutor comes and says that it was Robert Kajuga who said that in Kibuye they had formed an Interahamwe, that is a meeting.  But if it's a private individual saying that, that doesn't make any sense.  And the paragraph quoted from was not a quote reflecting what Kajuga had said.  So let's give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and the -- what he said was not a direct quote from Robert Kajuga.  

MR. N'DOW:
Mr. President, I think the beauty of the system is that there are always opportunities for re-examination.  And if Mr. Weyl wishes to clarify this, he can do so in re-examination.  

If I could proceed.
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, would it change your answer if I told you that at this particular meeting Karemera, Nzirorera, Ngirumpatse, were present and they spoke at this meeting?  Would it change your answer? 
A.	I told you that I was not there.  So, how can I say -- how can I testify to something which I did not witness? 
Q.	But, Mr. Witness, you were not present.  You were not in Rwanda for most of -- from 1971 to 1992 you were not in Rwanda.  You were working as an ambassador.  So you wouldn't know much about these meetings, would you? 
A.	My answer -- 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, excuse me.  I would like to understand what is the relevance of the line of questioning by the Prosecutor when he asks the witness whether Nzirorera, Karemera and others were present at that meeting held in 1993.  What is he insinuating?  I really don't understand the relevance of that question.  In 1992, 1991, 1992-1993, there were youths, there were rallies, there were meetings.  I don't know.  

Prosecutor, what is the relevance of your question? 
MR. N'DOW:
I think, Mr. Nimy, if you want to clarify any issues, you can do so in re-examination.  And just allow me to continue my cross-examination.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, would you agree that the Interahamwe existed as an organisation in Kibuye following this meeting? 
A.	Do you want me to repeat what I have already said? 
Q.	No.  Let's move on, Mr. Witness.  

Mr. Witness, when you returned from your ambassadorial duties, did you live in Kibuye? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Where did you live? 
A.	In Kigali.  
Q.	Did you attend any MRND meetings in Kibuye after you came from your ambassadorial duties? 
A.	Yes, once in Nyamirambo.  That was a rally organised at the level of the Kigali préfecture.  
Q.	I mean any meetings in Kibuye, MRND meetings.  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Can you tell us which meetings you attended? 
A.	Since in my commune, that is, Kivumo -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Kivumo is spelt K-I-V-U-M-O.
THE WITNESS:
We elected the bourgmestre of the commune, that is, Kivumo commune, and we took advantage of that election to celebrate the victory, because there were two candidates standing for the post.  There was a candidate of MDR, and there was a candidate of MRND.  So we won the election and we celebrated the victory, and we talked about politics, membership to our party.  That was the kind of meetings I attended.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I think there is a problem here because earlier on he talked about a meeting or rallies of MRND, whereas I think that here we are talking about MDR meetings.  I don't know whether I didn't hear what was said, but I still wonder whether he is talking about MDR or MRND. 
THE WITNESS:
I think I answered the question by talking about the MDR meeting.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Witness, I was asking about MRND meetings, MRND meeting.  Have you attended any MRND meetings in Kibuye? 
A.	Yes.  Initially, yes.  Before I withdrew from MRND, I attended a meeting in Kibuye.  That meeting had been organised by the MRND.  
Q.	And when was this, Mr. Witness? 
A.	It must have been sometime in mid-1992.  I don't remember the exact date.  I don't recall the exact date.  At one point I joined that party and then I joined the MDR.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, when did you join the MDR? 
A.	It must be at the beginning of 1993, because dates, months -- I was thinking about things and felt I might play a part in advising, suggesting, so I withdrew to go over to the other party.  I took the time I needed to think about it.  So I don't remember the date.  
Q.	This was during the heydays of multipartyism in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes.  Yes, at the outset, at the beginning, we were all in the same party.  Multiparty politics was born.  I didn't immediately leave.  I had to analyse the pros and cons, the role of the MRND, the part I could play, and my opinion told me that it would be better to join another party, and I chose the MDR.  That is as simple as that.  
Q.	And, Mr. Witness, would you agree with me that during this period the MDR was very critical of the government of Habyarimana?  Do you agree? 
A.	What does it mean, opposition?  Opposition means criticism.  That is opposition.  In my way of thinking, in my understanding, someone else can have another understanding.  But opposition means criticism on several matters, economic, social.  That's it.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, are you aware of correspondence by the leader of the MDR to President Habyarimana criticising the government and its association with the Interahamwe?  Are you aware of such correspondence? 
A.	No.  I told you I was a simple party member.  So I couldn't know what went on at higher levels.  So I am not at all aware of that.  
MR. N'DOW:
With the assistance of the registry, the witness can be shown document number 2 of my list of documents.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, looking at paragraph 2 of the said letter, it is dated the 17th of November 1992, and it was a letter -- 
MR. SOW:
Mr. Prosecutor, please.  The name you pronounced is not in conformity with the author of the letter.  I think you said Twagiramungu instead of saying Nsengiyaremye; is that correct?  Could you specify who signed this letter?
MR. N'DOW:
I am not giving any names, but this was a letter signed by Dismas Nsengiyaremye, and it was addressed to President Habyarimana. 
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you look at paragraph 2 of the same letter? 
A.	Which page, please?  
Q.	Paragraph 2, beginning with your stance on Arusha Accords.  

Mr. Witness, have you finished reading it? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	If one looks at that paragraph, Mr. Witness, Dr. Dismas is complaining about President Habyarimana's stance on the Arusha Accords and the security problems he posed in the country by asking the Interahamwe to support his electoral campaign.  Are we agreed on that? 
A.	Yes, quite.  But I need the background, the context.  What did the president say?  What is his position?  Can you tell me that, please? 
Q.	Mr. Witness, this was Dr. Dismas' reaction to speeches made by Habyarimana at an MRND rally held in Ruhengeri on the 15th of November 1992.  Does that clarify matters for you? 
A.	Not at all, because I do not have, in my possession, the tenor, the context, the tenor of what President Habyarimana said at that meeting or at that rally.  
Q.	Do you remember President Habyarimana making remarks to the effect that the Arusha Accords were a piece of paper?  Do you recall such an incident? 
A.	I heard those words, but not from the mouth of President Habyarimana.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, at this stage, really, I think that the Defence would like to remind us in a timely way of something.  Indeed, the Prosecutor has before him a letter from Dismas Nsengiyaremye.  But I think that before this Trial Chamber this was an issue that was resolved.  We have listened to recordings on the other side, as well as on this side, everybody agreed to what they had seen, read and heard, that at no point did President Habyarimana use the word "rag". 
MR. N'DOW:
Sorry, Mr. President, for my intervention.  If the witness can be asked to remove his headphones, please.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
I will continue the debate here, and the Court must be abused.  This problem was solved a long time ago.  Everyone agreed, after hearing, after checking, that Habyarimana, President Habyarimana 
never said rags of paper.  So it is not because it occurs in another document that we are going to submit it to the witness for him to confirm it or not.  I think we can do without this type of exercise, because if Mr. Dismas mentions it in his letter, it's Mr. Dismas' responsibility, and we should call him here to explain why he said something that President Habyarimana never said in any speech, as to 
put this to the witness, whereas the Prosecutor knows this discussion is behind us is abuse of our time, and he knows it well.  So, what is he asking the witness about the meaning of terms used by 
Dismas Nsengiyaremye? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. N'dow, I come back to you on this question of time. 
MR. N'DOW:
Yes.  Mr. President, I hope to finish at least before half twelve.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yesterday afternoon we thought you were going to take less than two hours. 
MR. N'DOW:
Yes, Your Honours.  Because of the objections by the Defence, I have to take a bit longer.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Look, please, don't -- just don't (inaudible).

We actually -- I was sort of gently suggesting to you that we weren't quite certain that there was much value in pursuing this line of examination, and I thought you had understood that.  
MR. N'DOW:
Thank you for that suggestion.  

BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, now coming to the 12th of April when you left -- when you said you left Kigali, where did you stay prior to leaving Kigali? 
A.	At home, at my place.  
Q.	And in which area of Kigali is your home, Mr. Witness?
A.	Kiyovu.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Kiyovu is spelt K-I-Y-O-V-U.  Avenue Paul VI.  The Sixth Avenue.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, from the -- between the 6th and the 12th, did you have any cause to leave your home? 
A.	I complied with the instructions given by the army to stay home until further notice.  That's it.  I stayed home.  I would add that, as there was exchange of fire between our army and the RPF, who were on Rubero hill, and that the exchange of fire was over my house.  My wife and I slept in the hall, in the corridor.  And I take this opportunity to point out that the exchange of fire began on the 8th of April, the intense exchange of fire coming from Rubero.  And I was asking myself, "How can the RPF soldiers -- how did they get there?  How did they learn this so quickly, whereas the distance between the CND and Rubero, is as the crow flies, is two to three kilometres."  The astonishment -- was the RPF already there?  I am asking you.  I am putting my question to you.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  

Mr. Witness, how did you get to meet the archbishop of Kigali? 
A.	When? 
Q.	When you said you met him on the 12th and travelled with him to Gitarama.  
A.	No, that is a misunderstanding.  I underscored that when I got up to the archbishopric, I met the 
	two bishops whose names I gave you yesterday, and which we travelled together.  It wasn't with the archbishop.  
Q.	Thank you for that clarification.  

Mr. Witness, on your way to meeting the two bishops, did you see any roadblocks on the way? 
A.	The roadblock I referred to yesterday was the major roadblock.  Otherwise I noticed a roadblock in front of the national bank, which is next door to the archbishopric, but I saw it on the side, on the right.  But the -- apart from the roadblock I referred to, I mentioned yesterday there wasn't any other, except for the roadblock I passed through coming from my place, but it was guarded by a gendarme just below the military academy, but I got through without any problem.
Q.	Mr. Witness, we also have reports of dead bodies on the streets of Kigali.  What do you say to that?
A.	Before I left home or after?  
Q.	Before you left home.  That was on the 12th, itself, when you went to see the bishops.  
A.	We must be quite precise.  I didn't go to see them.  I met them as they were leaving to flee.  I didn't go to find them.  It is by chance that I reached the spot at the time when they also were leaving.  But as regards corpses, I didn't see any.  Perhaps they were removed before I left home, but I did not see any.  
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Witness, did you pass through a roadblock in Nyabugogo? 
A.	Nyabugogo, but that's the one I am talking of.  
Q.	What did you see at the roadblock at Nyabugogo, Witness?
A.	I repeat what I said.  But it's unfortunate.  You should have recorded it.  Then you wouldn't ask me a question where I have to repeat.  We were met by a group of young people who made us get down from our cars, made us kneel on the ground, humiliated us, who were enjoying bringing down figures of prominence, persons of responsibility.  They were at the roadblock.  It was the only one, and there were those young people.  

And further down, I underscore that also there were Rwandan soldiers, and we were freed by the firing that came from the Jali mountain.  I've said that already.  If you want me to repeat it, of course, I will repeat it, but I did not see anything else.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, how were they able to recognise you as those who were (inaudible)? 
A.	Who?  
Q.	The youths.  The gang of youths.  You said they were humiliating you and saying that you were leaving them behind.  So, how were they able to recognise that you were in the government, or you were a person of prominence? 
A.	In such a situation -- I have to explain this to the Trial Chamber.  I am not a man who glorifies in titles. But at the time I thought more of the bishops, moreover -- because they really were flabbergasted.  I told the young people, "Do you know I am a former ambassador?", thinking it would dissuade them.  That's all.  I said that before them.  But it was a mistake on my part because then, they took advantage of it.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you travel with any of the government convoys? 
A.	What convoys?  
Q.	On that particular day, we have evidence that the government -- a convoy of dignitaries from the government actually travelled from Kigali to Gitarama.  Were you among the government convoy? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, what time of day did you travel from Kigali? 
A.	11 o'clock.  Noon.  It was full day.  
Q.	And, Mr. Witness, you stated that you went straight to Kabgayi.  Why did you have to go straight to Kabgayi? 
A.	Well, up to that point, Kabgayi was calm, and I wanted to rest because my wife had a heart problem.  She was tired.  And the rector of the senior seminary at Kabgayi was a friend of mine, at least I knew him.  I went to ask him if he could put us up, and we spent a night there.  
Q.	And did you see any members of the government in Kabgayi? 
A.	The new government that had just been instituted, I had seen some of them, the minister of defence, I think, in particular, who passed there.  People would come and go.  
Q.	Are you aware of the visit by international journalists in Kabgayi during that period? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, were you at any time in Murambi? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And can you tell us when you were in Murambi? 
A.	I went to Murambi because the government had its seat there.  I simply wanted to see whether I could meet the minister to ask him if he had any information, to try and get information to know what was going on.  I had been an ambassador.  I couldn't just stay like that.  So I would go around and try to inform myself. 
Q.	And can you tell us when, approximately, this was? 
A.	No, no.  That, no.  So, look, I arrived on the 12th, I spent the night.  I went to Kibuye.  I came back to Kabgayi and before going to Gisenyi -- and in the meantime I would move around.  I would see the people displaced by the war.  I would see the clergymen.  I would go around.  I saw the préfet.  I would see those people trying to get information.  You asked me what date -- I just moved around, because we needed to know what was happening, what was going on. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, who did you see? 
A.	I met Kambanda, but he did not have time.  I shook hands with him, but he did not have time to talk with me, and I understand that because he was overwhelmed.  
Q.	Apart from Kambanda, did you talk to anyone else, Mr. Witness? 
A.	No -- I think I even saw President Théodore, but I just shook hands with him, with the officials who were there, but I did not have in-depth discussions with them.  I was simply looking for information.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you attend any cabinet meetings during this period? 
A.	From whom?  In which capacity, rather? 
Q.	I am just asking you:  Did you attend any cabinet meetings during this period? 
A.	No.  No.  
MR. N'DOW:
With the assistance of the registry, can the witness be shown document number 4 of my bundle?  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you recall attending any meetings of the interim government on the 7th of May 1994 and on the 15th of May 1994? 
A.	15th of May?  I was in Kibuye.  No, no.  On the 15th of May I was in Belgium, that is, in 1994.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, on the 7th of May? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, could the Prosecutor repeat his question because part of the question was not audible since the mike was off.  Thank you, sir.
MR. N'DOW:
Sorry, interpreters.  If I could repeat.
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you attend any meetings of the interim government on the 7th of May and on the 
	15th of June 1994? 
A.	On the 7th of May, no.  On the 15th of June, in Gisenyi, but it was not a cabinet meeting.  Ministers had moved.  They were in Gisenyi.  I had just returned from Belgium.  I was trying to meet ministers.  We would meet on the terrace or veranda and talk about the situation.  I was present.  I was even provocative because I was asking them "What can we do?"  I went as far as telling them that the people were being threatened.  That was the kind of meetings I am talking about, but not a structured cabinet meeting.  We would meet on the terraces, in the restaurants.  That's what happened.  I have to say that I even urged people.  Yes. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, is it your name that is indicated in the odre du jour, the minutes of that particular meeting of the 7th?  Is that your name, Munyeshyaka?  Is that your name, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Which page, please?  
Q.	That is after the handwritten notes, page 5 of the bundle that I have just given to you.  
A.	I can see page 20.  There is a telegram here with the word "Munyeshyaka".  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I would like to assist the Prosecutor.  

Mr. President, the document which I have in front of me talks about the cabinet meeting of 
7th of May 1994.  And in this document, you have the agenda.  And the way I understand is that you have 1 to 12 items on the agenda.  So points 1 to 12 were items on the agenda of the meeting, and the names in the items of the agenda are not cabinet members.  These are names to be discussed as items on the agenda.  So, I wanted to assist the Prosecutor by telling him that an agenda consists of items which include subjects to be discussed in a meeting, but that does not mean that if your name is on one of the items on the agenda, then you are a participant in that meeting.  So I just wanted to assist the Court.  

Thank you, Mr. President.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I would like to add to what Counsel Nimy has just said.  It says that -- here it says, Telegram, and then Munyeshyaka.  I was abroad.  I was in Belgium.  And I had gone to Belgium to attend a meeting which had nothing to do with politics at that time.  They tried to send a telegram to me, but I never received the telegram.  And, as counsel said, you know that was what happened, and they tried to send a telegram to me because they knew that I was not there.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you just tell us why your name featured in both minutes of the meeting of the 
	7th of May and the 15th of June, why your name featured there? 
A.	I have just said that with regard to the meeting of the 7th of May, I was in Belgium.  And, actually, I was on my way there.  I had not even landed there.  And Counsel Nimy, who is quite alert clearly clarified that matter.  So, if the ministers knew that I had travelled, they could have thought:  "Wouldn't it be useful to send to Mr. Munyeshyaka a telegram," because that is what is in this item on the agenda.  That is the first point.  

Now, regarding the meeting of the 15th, as I have told you, I used to provoke everybody.  I wanted them to do something.  We would meet on a terrace in Gisenyi, after coming back from Belgium and people wanted to know what was happening.  So what was happening in Belgium -- they wanted to know what was happening in Belgium.  So when they saw me, they would ask questions, and I would also ask them questions.  I did that several times because the ministers were there, and I thought that it was appropriate to talk with them about the catastrophic situation prevailing in our country at that time.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, how did they know that you were in Belgium? 
A.	You see, I held positions of responsibility.  I was known in political circles.  My presence and my absence were noticed.  And anyone who might have seen me could have said, "Look, he has travelled."  I think that's normal.  At a certain age if they had wanted me to play any role, they would have known whether I was absent or not, and that was easy because people were meeting there.  If they had not seen me for some time, they would ask themselves, "Where is he?"  Furthermore, my wife had remained there, so it was easy for them to ask her, "Where is your husband?"  
Q.	And they trust you to forward faxes or forward messages on their behalf, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Well, if they did that, it means that they trusted me.  But I am telling you that I never received that message.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  

Mr. Witness, when did you arrive in Kibuye? 
A.	On the 13th of April 1994.
Q.	And can you describe to the Court how the situation was like in Kibuye? 
A.	Yesterday I described my trip to Kibuye.  Do you want me to repeat it? 
Q.	No, Mr. Witness.  Mr. Witness, during this time, was there a war in Kibuye between the RPF and the government? 
A.	During my stay in Kibuye, I remained indoors at the guesthouse.  I met Tutsis who had been displaced.  We shared the same concern for security.  I did not go out in order to look at the atmosphere in Kibuye prevailing at the time.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, I suggest to you that during this time there was no war in Kibuye.  Do you agree to that? 
A.	But because of the young people who had humiliated me on my way, I did not want to venture out.  And if I did, why would I have gone?  
Q.	Would you agree with me, Mr. Witness, that the RPF had not entered Kibuye at this time? 
A.	Officially, invisibly, the RPF were not there.  But I would like to tell you -- I would like to tell you that 
	we Rwandans, when we meet, we always talk.  And for your information, in my discussions with those displaced Tutsis who had sought refuge at the guesthouse, we talked about the situation outside.  There was a Tutsi who said, I quote, "You see such-and-such a person's house."  I did not know that person.  He was mentioning names.  So he said, "At such-and-such a Tutsi's house, weapons were found".  But I did not take that to be reliable information because someone can tell you, "We found 
	A, B, C at X's place, or JHK in Z's place."  So I did not take this as reliable information.  But these are the kinds of chats I had with them, and I was listening to them.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, are you aware of reinforcements being sent to Kibuye to fight the RPF? 
A.	I am not aware of that at all.  I am not aware at all of that.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President -- I am sorry, Prosecutor.  This is the part which I do not understand.  If the RPF troops were not there, the reinforcement was being sent to fight against whom?  You want the witness to say that RPF troops were not there, and then you said that there were reinforcements sent in order to fight against the RPF.  Could you please explain that to us, Prosecutor?  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you agree that Mr. Karemera was sending reinforcements to Kibuye to fight the RPF?  Would you agree to that? 
A.	For one to agree with you on a point, one has to be associated with the persons concerned.  So, regarding that question, I don't even know to which timeframe you are referring.  In any event, this is the very first time that I am hearing that Édouard Karemera allegedly sent reinforcements there.  Believe me, this is my first time and I am hearing it from you.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, evidence has been admitted in this case that Mr. Karemera sent reinforcements from Gisenyi to Kibuye, to Bisesero, to do what is called ratissage? 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I am sorry.  I apologise.  

Mr. President, this is totally unacceptable.  What the Prosecutor is saying is false and totally false, because there is no proof at all that Mr. Karemera sent reinforcement to Gisenyi or elsewhere.  That is totally false.  I think, Mr. President, this is not a method that should be used, in other words, to mislead the witness.  Things have to be stated fairly.  What the Prosecutor is doing and the manner in which he is proceeding is not fair at all on his part.  It is not befitting for him to do that.  
THE WITNESS:
With your leave, Mr. President, I would like to add -- 
MR. N'DOW:
This letter -- what I am saying here is that this letter was admitted into evidence.  And Ms. Diagne knows very well that this letter of the 17th of June was admitted into evidence.  And I am just putting it to the witness that this was admitted into evidence.  I am asking for his comments.  So I am not making any false assertions here.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I remember very clearly -- I was present at that session -- there was a letter sent by Mr. Édouard Karemera to the préfet of Kibuye following a cabinet meeting for a possible mopping up operation.  But that should not be linked with the actual sending of reinforcements.  By doing so, I think the Prosecutor is going too far.  Maybe he should have talked about the letter, but he should not have said that Mr. Karemera actually sent reinforcements in order to fight against the RPF, because these are two totally different things.  And also, maybe the Prosecutor should show the witness the letter so that the witness could be better informed.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, this is the sixth Defence witness, I believe, and I think that we should actually put things in their proper place.  When Defence was cross-examining Prosecution witnesses, whenever we quoted from anything, we were asked about the line, the page, and the provenance of the document.  We were asked to read out, word by word, from our documents.  And if there was even one word which was inappropriate, we were told our quotations were not correct.  

But since it is the Prosecution now that is carrying out the cross-examination of Defence witnesses, they are vague.  They are distorting quotations.  They are calling an agenda minutes.  They are putting words in mouths of people who had nothing to do with those words, and they are doing this systematically.  So I think that the Prosecutor should proceed along the same lines as the Defence did when cross-examining their witnesses.  

If they have any evidence they want to read out to a witness, they should do so accurately, with full information regarding the facts, without mischaracterisation, distortions and without being vague, as has been the case systematically since the Defence case commenced.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
(Pages 15 to 30 by Sithembiso Moyo)








1225H 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. N'dow, we have come back to the issue of time.  We think you have gone beyond the time that should be allocated for this cross-examination.  We don't see the particular value of the questions that you're putting now, in view of what the witness has stated -- acknowledges where he was living, where he was working.  It's obvious that he's not going to be in a position to make any particular contribution to the particular issues that you're putting right now.  

And a lot of time has been wasted up to this point on matters which are not very significant.  Now, are you about to wind up your cross-examination?  
MR. N'DOW: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I have only two questions.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Can you put them now?  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I suggest to you that you were a member of the MRND who joined the Hutu wing -- who joined the MRND -- a member of the MR -- MDR who joined the MRND mainly because --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I'm sorry, Mr. N'dow. 
MR. N'DOW: 
Sorry, sir.  I think I have to just -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please, just start again.  
MR. N'DOW: 
Yes.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I put it to you that, like most moderate Hutus who later joined the ranks of the extremist Hutus and gained support of the MRND government, you are here mainly to shift the blame from the leaders of the Hutu government.  
A.	Mr. Saidou, I cannot agree with that expression.  When you say, "Hutu extremists of the then government", I energetically reject that.  We were in disarray.  The media wanted to stick on us -- to stick on people who were -- believed such labels.  So, I do not agree with that.  And at every opportunity given to me, I will express my point of view and say that is false.  
MR. N'DOW: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  That ends my cross-examination of this witness.  

Mr. President, I would like to seek the admission of the radio transcripts.  They were already admitted into evidence.  The tape, itself, was admitted into evidence, and portions of it, especially relating to the speech by Nzirorera, were admitted into evidence.  I want the rest of the document to be admitted into evidence, especially those that pertain to the speeches of Kajuga and the MRND president -- and the Interahamwe president in Kibuye.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I do not see the relevance of admitting into evidence those documents, particularly since this witness is not Robert Kajuga and this witness was a member of MDR.  So, I do not see how and why they want to use this witness to enter into evidence a document which does not concern him, because he was not even present at that meeting that they're talking about, the meeting of the 
7th November 1993.  For the aforementioned reasons, I request the Trial Chamber not to admit into evidence the said documents.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, if I can just briefly offer a point of clarification on the admission of the transcripts, if we look at P.12, the entire video of the meeting that was held on the 7th of November 1993 is in 
evidence -- is already in evidence as a Prosecution exhibit.  Along with P. 12, there are snippets of the transcripts that were admitted into evidence when we had them when the exhibit was first tendered.  Since then, the language section has completed its transcription of the entire video recording of that meeting.  

So, really, here we are addressing an administrative matter, not a substantive evidentiary matter.  The evidence is already in evidence.  The evidence, the best evidence, is the video recording itself, which this Chamber has as P. 12.  And at this point, we're simply seeking to admit transcripts that were not available when it was first tendered.  So it's really not -- shouldn't be a controversial matter.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Weyl.
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President.  Thank you.  

To the best of my recollection, what was admitted was admitted in respect of a specific point.  Here, emphasis is being put on a solution consisting of admitting into evidence everything without verifying and checking the contents thereof, by ambush, in the pretext of that previous admission of a small portion of a document.  We cannot proceed in this manner.  With regard to the Ruhengeri meeting video, the Prosecutor, under the pretext of admitting an element of detail, wanted to sneak in everything.  I think if you want to admit an entire document, it should be counter-checked in its entirety. and not use just a paragraph and try to sneak in an entire paragraph without any prior verification from the other party.  

Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, we have no objections to the -- 
MR. WEYL: 
From my point of view, this witness is not the most qualified witness through which this document should be tendered.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
If I may offer a suggestion, this does not have to be resolved now, Your Honours.  Mr. Weyl can look at the transcript and compare it to the video and come back to us if he has any objection.  But the simple point is that the transcription is simply another way of providing the same information that we have in the video that was admitted.  But if he would like to double-check it against the video, he can do that, and we can resolve this particular point at another time. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, this is a red-letter day.  I was just about to say that this is the first time I can remember being in total agreement with what Mr. Weyl has said, and now I have the same thing associated with regard to you.  So, to agree with you and Mr. Weyl at the same time, I feel it calls for celebration.  Let's go for lunch right away.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President's microphone. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Will there be any redirect of this witness?  None?  
MR. SOW: 
Yes, Mr. President, a few questions, which should not take, let's say, ten minutes.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  We'll come back.  

We'll take the luncheon break now.  

Mr. Witness, I remind you not to discuss the case or your testimony during this or any adjournment. 
(Court recessed from 1245 to 1412). 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon.  Mr. Sow, you may continue.  
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Witness.  

THE WITNESS: 
May I?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please do. 
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, you have before you a man of 67 years of age.  At the age of 40, I weighed a little over 60 kilos.  Today I'm content with carrying a weight of 25 kilos.  I am referring here to the Roman adage that the dagger must incline before the toga, and the toga was worn by senators and the sword itself by the army.  

Mr. President, you are wearing the toga, and this is what reassures us.  Before this morning's session, the Prosecutor talked about having admitted into evidence a document, and the Defence counsel protested, and they are better armed than I am.  However, before finishing, he talked about extremism, and he said that I was one of those extremists.  I raised my voice in order to raise protest.  

Mr. President, this is a wound to me.  This is the very first time in my life where somebody has tried to qualify me with such a description.  And if I heard -- if I heard well, and if I'm not mistaken, because I might have understood his words in an erroneous manner or misunderstood him, I would request that this expression be withdrawn and that he withdraw that description.  

Mr. President, I do not want to go home and find myself in the presence of my wife and children while still bearing such a description and such a wound to my personality.  You are the only doctor who can administer treatment in such a situation.  And I thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, we understand the concerns you've expressed, but I must explain to you, as I have had to explain to many witnesses, that what we are doing here is really listening to your testimony.  The questions put to you by the Prosecutor, or the suggestions that he makes to you, are not evidence as such.  They are -- they have the character of something that's prompting you to express yourself.  And what you express is the evidence that we address.  

So, whatever suggestions he put to you, even though it may -- you may feel bad about it, that is not what is part of our evidentiary basis when we're considering the evidence of the case.  I hope that will satisfy you.  
THE WITNESS: 
I accept your comments, and it is, in fact, the sword who inclines before the gown.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much. 
Mr. Sow. 
MR. SOW: 
Good afternoon, Mr. President.  Good afternoon, Your Honours.  

Mr. President, I would like to make a request that you might authorise that I sit down every now and then after putting questions to the witness, because I'm having blood pressure problems since last night, and I am occasionally obliged to sit down in order to recuperate.  And if the Trial Chamber would grant me leave to do so, please. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Permission is granted.  
MR. SOW: 
Much obliged, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, I would also like to make a request to authorise the witness, once he has finished testifying, that during this afternoon's mid-afternoon recess he also greet the three accused.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
As usual, the request is granted, and we ask the registrar to make the arrangements. 
MR. SOW: 
I thank you, Mr. President.  
RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, good afternoon.  
A.	Good afternoon.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, I am going to redirect for a few minutes, and I would like for you, Mr. Witness, to revisit an issue.  There is a document which the Prosecutor gave to you under number 5, marked as P. 113.  This document is with reference to your refugee dossier, and on page 10 thereof.  Do you have the document?  
MR. SOW: 
Madam Registrar, could you please give the witness the document?  We are talking here of document number 5, P. 113.  

Yes.  Thank you.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Please go to page 10.  
A.	Yes, I've found it.  
Q.	At page 10, a question was put to you -- this is the second paragraph:  "Have you already made an application for a refugee status in Belgium or in any other country?" To which you answered, "Yes".  And then, "If so, where?"  And you said "On the 1st of October 1988."  

Can you confirm that these were the correct answers to the question? 
A.	I shall explain myself.  In view of the fact that I was supposed to be going to Belgium to take up residence there, I approached the consul general for Belgium in Barcelona, and I made the application, and the response was some time in coming.  And in the interim I went to Belgium.  I then presented myself to the relevant department in Belgium, and this is how they came to request that I fill in these documents.  

So, this is with reference to the measures taken through the consul general in Barcelona.  
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  And then it's written the word "Result.  But on the 6th of September 2000, I obtained the status of refugee."  
A.	Yes, at that moment in time, I was still involved in the paperwork.  And Spain did, indeed, grant me the status of refugee, which allowed me to enter Belgium, because, of course, the answer was taking quite a time to come.  And this is how I gained legal entry to Belgium in 2002, 2003.  
Q.	Would it not be true today to say that once you had been granted refugee status from Spain, in Brussels you merely requested that that status be transferred from Spain to Brussels? 
A.	Indeed.  I filled in the paperwork.  And I had just married again, and the document bears the name of my wife, of her children, whom I adopted.  So this means that I had to fill in the various forms which were necessary in order to shed light on the situation, because the Belgian department was asking that I declare who I was.  And this is how I came to fill in the forms.  And then I requested that my dossier be transferred.  
Q.	At an earlier stage when the Prosecutor was involved in conducting his cross-examination, you made mention with reference to President Habyarimana, who was killed, that is, you talked about the assassins.  

Now, in order to bring a point of clarification on this issue and so that there is no confusion whatsoever, could you please say who or what you were referring to in so saying?  Because in the indictment, itself, mention is made of Hutu extremists who are allegedly responsible for the assassination of the president.  Could you please provide us with further clarification when you talk about the assassins?  
A.	Counsel Sow, you are right to request clarification on that point.  It is true that when I mentioned the word "assassins", it was vague.  However, I did need to be able to express myself further on the subject, and you're allowing me to do so.  I believe that this will take a little bit more time.  

You are putting a question to me that has been put to me on a number of occasions.  More specifically, when I went to the Belgian authorities when visiting Belgium in order to attend the Pax Christi association meeting, the director of political affairs put the following question to me.  He said, "Is it not true that President Habyarimana was assassinated by Hutu extremists?" And he could see that I was surprised, and he started again.  He said, "Well, Ambassador, either President Habyarimana was killed by Hutu extremists, or the RPF, or Belgians."  And he talked about the Belgians because the Belgians had just lost the ten Blue Helmets, and there were a lot of rumours going around that the Belgians were behind this.  

So, I said to him that before investigations were led, I could not confirm the veracity of these three positions.  However, I reacted by saying that, as regards the Hutu extremists, I responded categorically by saying that this was false.  These extremists, fabricated by the press or media -- I don't know who -- and -- well, even if they did exist, they could not have actually brought down the pillar or foundation, or that very own foundation.  But, he reacted by saying, "But you are in the habit of assassinating your leaders when they become long in the tooth".  And I said, "Well, those are the habits of the former Tutsi regimes," I said.  And this is why I should explain this fact to you. 

Under the monarchy, the king, when aging, would have gray hair, and this meant that the king was old.  This meant that he no longer had the strength to lead and to fight.  Because our kings fought.  However, I would like to draw to your attention the fact that the courtesans, who were the ones who tended to his person, would pull out those gray hairs so that the general public would not notice.  However, the king did, one day, have to die.  And in our country there is a king -- there is an expression in the Kinyarwanda language saying that the king had to give, that is to say, he had to give the power to others.  And once he had done so, he had to then disappear.  

And how was it that he was then put to his death?  Well, it was said that the king had to drink.  And he was laid on his bed, and a quantity of milk was poured into his mouth until he choked.  It's cruel, but that's how it was.  So, the king had to drink.  And that is the answer I gave.  

Well, the Hutus were only in power for a period of 30 years, and I have not known of any president who has been killed in such a manner.  However, the director of political affairs was referring to information that he had gleaned from somewhere without providing any clarification.  However, when I talk about the assassins, or those who are guilty, we do have information.  We have material.  We have reports.  We have investigations which were conducted by individuals whose faith one cannot doubt, notably, the report by Judge Bruguière and Judge Jordi (phonetic) in Spain.  And these are documents.  

However, this is the path so that a free investigation, without any constraint whatsoever, can be led in order for us to be able to ascertain who is guilty.  Today, a finger is being pointed at the RPF so that people will not dare lead investigations in order to find out quite how Rwanda came to be plunged into its very own tomb.  And that is my answer to your question, Counsel Sow.  
Q.	Thank you for your answer, Witness. 

Witness, you have said that you passed the Nyabugogo roadblock? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And you said that you found rioters.  I wanted to ask you -- because, as you know, this roadblock has often been mentioned, very often -- we have been told, yes, there were Interahamwe manning the roadblocks, and when you get there, the first thing is to ask you your ethnic group.  

You, who passed that roadblock, can you tell us whether that version, given to the world at large, is your own personal experience? 
A.	We arrived at the roadblock.  There were quite a few, maybe 30 or 40, young people who were dancing, who were there.  And when they saw us, they stopped us and we got down -- they forced us to get down from our vehicles.  They did not ask us for our ethnic group or documents or anything.  The two bishops, whom I referred were each one in his own vehicle wearing that distinctive sign of bishops.  I was surprised that those young people, who must have been baptised, were not afraid by the bishops' habit.  

They merely got us on our knees.  The Interahamwe that has been spoken of, I saw an unruly young people who stopped us, who humiliated us.  And I tell you that when I tried to -- tried to explain who I was, oh, they rejoiced.  They said, "Ah, now it is an opportunity to put them in our place; down on the ground."  

So, that was the atmosphere that I witnessed, that I experienced.  I cannot add anything more. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. SOW: 
Madam Registrar, I should like you to show to the witness the document brought by the Prosecutor relating -- or, narrating the meeting of the 7th of November 1993.  

Mr. N'dow, can you remind us of your reference?  I can no longer find it.  
MR. N'DOW: 
That will be page 18 of the French text.  Page 18 of the French text.  
MR. SOW: 
What was the number, please, of the document you tendered?  
MR. N'DOW: 
It's document number 1, and it was admitted as P. 12.  It's the transcript -- radio transcript.  It was the first document that we tendered.  

MR. SOW: 
That is fine.  Could you please show it to the witness?  It's page 19 that is of interest to me.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Go to page 19, second paragraph.  Witness, have you found page 19? 
A.	Yes, I have it.
Q.	I should like you to read the sentence beginning with the words nearly at the middle of the paragraph, "dans les jours à venire", "In the days to come."
A.	"In the days to come, we would hold an Interahamwe congress in Kibuye préfecture.  The national Interahamwe -- Mr. National Interahamwe President, we seize this opportunity to invite you to it.  We invite you to come and honour with your presence this congress in the course of which we will also set up the Interahamwe préfecture committee.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
This is a translation from the booth, Mr. President, because we don't have the documents.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, what comment does this sentence call for in respect of the answer you provided to the Prosecutor regarding this matter?  
A.	Such a declaration, young people who went to meetings, rallies, get-togethers, might very well do so.  Why?  We have those young people who wanted to be noticed -- I underscore that -- and who attended various party meetings.  

For a young person to take the initiative of making such a statement, that could occur.  But not being on the spot, never having heard such a statement by a young person, I can say nothing.  But, guessing the aspect and the climate that obtained at the time, a young person who wanted to show himself in front of the others might do so.  But, what I saw on the part of the Interahamwe's organisation, if I saw any organised, I would say so.  But I saw people wearing badges of all parties.  And they'd wear a badge one day and the next day, they'd wear another one, the same people.  

One clarification:  Some young people who were known could not change parties, because the others could say to them, "Uh-huh, now be careful, be careful, be careful."  But those who could do so, did so.  Why?  Because, at the time of those meetings, the organisers would sometimes offer refreshments.  Why could the young people not take advantage thereof?  Because, they knew that in the end, decisions would come from above.  That is what I observed.  
Q.	Witness, in the sentence I asked you to read out, the speaker is referring to a congress to be held.  Now, at the national level, there was a provisional committee that had not yet held a congress.  

In speaking thus, was it not just hot air along the lines of confirming what you said?  
A.	This congress, I never heard about this congress, but it's true my information, my possibilities were limited.  But why not could a young person boast in this way, referring to such a matter, knowing full well that his commitment -- these were young people.  They could speak of congresses because there were congresses.  It was the fashion.  Yeah, we, too, we're going to have a congress.  But I wonder really, you can ask -- officials can say whether they did, indeed, have such a congress.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  

My last question.  You told us that you arrived in Kibuye on the 13th of April 1994.  Do you confirm that answer?  
A.	Yes, the 13th.  
Q.	How long did you stay in Kibuye? 
A.	13, 14, up to the 15th, those days when I said I was even attacked.  So, it was three or four days.
Q.	Did you move throughout Kibuye, or did you stay where you were staying?  
A.	At the guesthouse, without moving.  I've already answered that to the Prosecutor.  
Q.	Is it reasonable that a question should be put to you asking whether in Kibuye there was a confrontation between the Rwandan army and the RPF, you, who stayed shutted (sic) up where you were staying?  
A.	Well, precisely, that's my question.  That's the cause of my astonishment.  I said I didn't go out.  So, just to say that I could go out and observe, well, no.  No, no, no.  
Q.	Witness, I have finished my redirect.  I should like to thank you for having been kind enough to accept to come to testify.  And the Trial Chamber has authorised you at the break to meet the defendants.  Once again, I thank you, and I wish you a safe journey home.  God bless you and protect you. 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I have finished.  The next witness is XTL, who should presently be available. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Sow.  

Yes, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, could I express my feelings before you?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, we thank you for assisting this Tribunal in its work.  We think that you have had a full opportunity to express yourself.  In fact, your testimony lasted much longer than we had allocated for it.  And during that period, I think you had a full opportunity to express yourself, and we think we understand what you have to say on the matters that are relevant to our determination.  

So we would just like to thank you for assisting us in our work and to excuse you.  
(Witness excused)

MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
While we wait for the next witness, Mr. President, in respect of the outstanding documents for 
Witness CWL, all that I'm going to ask at this time, just so that we don't lose track of it, is that the document be marked for identification.  I am going to use the opportunity of the break, as it were, to seek to address the questions raised by the Defence.  Hopefully, we can deal with that without too much intervention from the Court. 

I'm advised that the next ID numbers will be IP. 14.  So, we would mark the cassette as A, the French as B, the English as C.  And we can revisit it in due course.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Marked for identification.
(Exhibit IP. 14A, IP. 14B and IP. 14C, marked for identification)
MR. MORLEY: 
May it please Your Honours, as we wait for the next witness, may I make an enquiry as to if we don't finish with this witness today, when it is Your Honours will be minded to continue with evidence?  It was my understanding that the Court will not be sitting in this case tomorrow, nor on Monday, and that we will be sitting in this case on Tuesday.  If that has changed, I welcome knowing what the change is at this stage.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We have been, in fact, apprised that there are matters which require our attention in Kalimanzira, and we have an informal meeting during the break this afternoon.  I think it will be better to address this question after we have had that meeting.  
MR. MORLEY: 
I'm obliged.  Thank you.
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good day, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We are going to commence your testimony now.  But as a preliminary, we have to ask you to take an oath or make a declaration to tell the truth.  And the registrar will now administer that to you. 
(Declaration made by Jean-Marie Vianney Nkezabera in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Witness and Madam Registrar.  

You will give your testimony by responding to questions put to you by the lawyers designated for that purpose.  And you'll have to respond first to the lawyer representing Édouard Karemera, Mr. Sow, who will now begin his examination of you.  
MR. SOW: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, before beginning, I should like to inform you that the witness that I met yesterday evening gave me to understand that he should like to testify publicly in open session.  Perhaps, you could determine the situation.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, the Court made an order for your protection.  Counsel, Mr. Sow, has indicated that you wish to have that order revoked, and I'd be grateful if you could inform us what your position is.  
THE WITNESS: 
It is quite true.  I should like to testify in open session, quite openly.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, thank you.  We will revoke the order of protection that we made in your favour and direct the registrar to make the necessary arrangements.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. SOW: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
JEAN-MARIE VIANNEY NKEZABERA,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, I shall give you the usual caution.  You speak French, as I do, so, please, when answering, please observe a slight pause after the question, just as I, after your answer, will observe a slight pause before putting the next question.  Do try also to speak at a reasonable pace in order that your testimony be duly recorded.  And any time you pronounce a proper noun in Kinyarwanda, I would ask you to kindly spell out such proper nouns for them also to be duly recorded.  

I shall begin in the beginning by wishing you good afternoon, Witness.  Forgive me for that.  
A.	Thank you.  You, too, Counsel, I wish you a good afternoon.  
Q.	Witness, since you are testifying openly, I will ask you for your name, your surname, and place and date of birth.  
A.	My name is Nkezabera, Jean-Marie Vianney.  I was born on the 16th of February 1951 at Mbazi, M-B-A-Z-I.  Nkezabera, N-K-E-Z-A-B-E-R-A, Nkezabera.  
Q.	What is your father's first and last name?  
A.	My father's last name is Nkezabera.  I don't believe I need to spell that again.  Damian is his first name.  My mother's name is Muka -- M-U-K-A-M-P-A-R-A-Y-E, and her first name is Veronique.  
MR. SOW: 
Could the registry clerk please come and pick up the personal identification sheet so that the witness might cast an eye over it and ascertain whether the information therein is correct, and then sign and date the document?  Thank you, Madam.  

Might I ask the registry clerk also to give him a blank sheet so that he might also write the names down before spelling them out?  Thank you.  
THE WITNESS: 
The date is the 8th today or the 9th?  
MR. SOW: 
We are the 8th today, Mr. Witness.  I thank you, Witness. 

Mr. President, I would like to have admitted into evidence, please, this personal identification sheet for the witness under D. K77, if I am correct.  D. K77. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. K77, admitted) 
MR. SOW: 
Much obliged, Mr. President.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, did you lose any members of your family during the events of April 1994? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Do you still have any relatives living in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes, I do.  
Q.	And in your family, do you have family members who are of both ethnic origins, that is to say, Hutu and Tutsi? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Witness, could you please tell us which position you held in April 1994? 
A.	In April 1994, I was a businessman, and I had a company for electrical installations, that is to say, air conditioning, and also fire safety.  
Q.	What is your highest level of qualification, Mr. Witness, in order to gain time? 
A.	I am an electronic engineer and technician, specialised in nuclear energy.  
Q.	Which political party were you a member of before 1994?  
A.	In April 1994, I was a member of the MDR party.  
Q.	And what position did you hold within the party itself?  
A.	In April 1994, I was a member of the political bureau of the party, and vice chairman of the party within Kigali-Ville préfecture.  And I had just been appointed, or elected, by the party congress in order to be a member of parliament within the transitional broad-based national assembly.  
Q.	Have you ever been convicted, Mr. Witness?  
A.	No. 
Q.	Are you the subject of any criminal proceedings? 
A.	Not at all.  
Q.	Could you tell us what your status is in your current country of residence?  And also tell us which country you reside in.  
A.	I live in Belgium and I am a Belgian citizen.  
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  We shall now broach the subject -- or move on to a new line of questioning.  

Do you know Édouard Karemera?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And how long have you known him for? 
A.	Since the 1970s, the beginning of 1970.  We arrived in Belgium at the same time.  He was going to study law, and I was planning to study for an engineering qualification, and we then remained in contact thereafter.  
Q.	Did you know Édouard Karemera when he was minister of public works -- or, minister within the civil service? 
A.	Yes, I have known him throughout his entire political career.  And this means that I did know him as a minister within the civil service.  
Q.	Were I to ask you to describe him, could you tell me how you would describe him as a person?  
A.	I don't suppose I should describe him as how I see him as a friend, but I shall base myself upon his qualities as political leader.  Even when he was a member of a political party that I did not frequent, he is somebody who has always fought for change.  And I might like to provide three examples of that, with your leave.  

For example, when he was minister of public -- of civil service, he -- I don't know whether it was a law or a habit within the country itself, which was a distinct handicap to everybody, that is to say, we, who were working within the private sector -- he was in favour, for example, of having an employee or a technician within your department.  And this individual had to be provided with an authorisation from the civil service, because the state deemed that those who had studied, and had been financed during their studies by the state, had to work for the state.  And he gave, as a reason, that even when one was working in the private sector, one is still working for the advancement of the country itself.  

Another example:  At the time when the MRND was the sole political party in existence, it was customary that whenever the president would create or set up a committee to study a specific fact, the committee would make sure that they found out quite what it was that the president wanted to have done, and they would work towards providing positive arguments in line with the president's line of thinking.  

So, when Karemera came to be appointed president of the synthesis committee, we all knew that his wish, as he had said himself in a speech dated the 5th of July 1990, in addressing the issue of political Aggiornamento, his wish was to implement further democracy within the single-party system, which was not a difficult thing to do, incidentally, because, the MRND, at that moment in time, was the only organisation -- worldwide, I believe -- which had as its supreme body, not a congress, but the president himself.  

So, when he was appointed to become the chairman of the synthesis committee, we were virtually sure that this committee would, like all others, advance the positive arguments or vision in order for the aggiornamento to be implemented within the MRND party.  
(Pages 31 to 45 by Lisa Smith)





















	1515H
THE WITNESS (continuing):
The committee then reached a conclusion whereby it accepted not only the Aggiornamento within the MRND party, but also showed that true democracy was really required throughout the country, that is to say, integral multiparty politics or fully-blown multiparty politics.  That was my second example, which, in chronological terms, comes, in fact, after the third example.  

The third example I would give is, a short time before this, he was appointed minister for institutional relations.  And to the best of my recollection, he left the ministry of civil service, and many people thought that this was a downward move, a demotion.  However, those people who knew him and who could analyse the actions of the president of the republic understood that the president wanted to appoint an individual who would be able to ensure liaison between the various institutions, who were all used to saying, "Yes, yes."  So those are the three examples I can provide in order to say that he was somebody who was able to move forward in his scheme of ideas. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Witness.  

Tell me, Mr. Witness, despite what you have said in favour of Mr. Édouard Karemera, can you tell us whether Mr. Édouard Karemera was a political ally or a political adversary? 
A.	Well, as a member of the MRND party, revised version, he was my political adversary. 
Q.	When you say the revised or reformed version of the party, what do you mean? 
A.	Well, before the year 1991, and I believe since the year 1974, until 1991, there was only one political party in existence in Rwanda, that is to say, the MRND.  And after the voting of the new law on political parties, the MRND party set up another party, which they also named the MRND, however, the letters in the abbreviation did not signify the same thing.  So, when I say MRND revised formula or version, I mean to say the MRND of the time of multiparty politics. 
Q.	I thank you for that point of clarification, Mr. Witness.

Mr. Witness, multiparty politics has been in existence since the year 1991, and there were then negotiations which gave rise to the Arusha peace agreement.  However, despite all of this, war still rages, quite simply, because the RPF continues to attack.  How could you explain such a situation or such an attitude? 
A.	It's a lengthy matter to explain.  Firstly, multiparty politics was put in place during the war with the RPF, which, to my mind, was a mistake, because in all other countries, when war is raging, everybody, even the other political parties, will forget and they will support the government in place in order to put a stop to the war.  

So, yes, we did do this.  And the law on the existence of all advent of multiparty politics was voted in in 1991.  And before this date I chaired meetings.  I was, in fact, the coordinator for the renovation and restructuring committee for the MDR party, which means that one month later, that is to say, on the 31st of July, after having held the assembly, the constituent assembly on the 1st of July, the MDR party was officially recognised as such, on the same date as the MRND party.  And two or three days later the PSD, PL and PDC, and a few other parties, were also recognised, and multiparty politics was implemented.  

After these political parties came into existence, people then requested that they become part of the government.  And, after a few demonstrations, the president accepted the idea in principle, and after a few months of discussion, the first multiparty government was put in place on the 16th of April 1992.  Within this government the MDR party, that is to say my party, took on the ministry of foreign affairs, which meant that we needed to enter negotiations for the end of the war.  

Other peace negotiations had been underway prior to that.  However, on each occasion there had been violations, and there was a tendency to say that it was still the government's fault.  However, once this multiparty government was put in place, one could see that things changed.  The RPF would have found it difficult to accuse the government.  Whilst struggling to take power, absolute power, that is, it will also engage in another insidious struggle.  I can give you two or three examples thereof.

As soon as this government was put in place, immediately after this, the minister of foreign affairs entered into pre-negotiations with the RPF, during which one accepted the idea in principle of negotiations for peace.  And I believe that for the month of July the government and the RPF were due to meet in Paris in order to table all the various measures and requirements for these negotiations.  

In the month of April -- or in the month of June, the RPF invited members of other political parties, which were described as opposition parties, despite the fact that we were part of the government itself, to meet in Brussels.  At the time we wondered why.  Certain individuals wondered why chairmen of political parties, who have their political party as part of the governmental structure and who, therefore, were within the ministry of foreign affairs itself, which had put in motion the principle of negotiations -- why these chairmen of political parties would once again enter into negotiations with the RPF.  

Anyway, they went to Brussels.  And, as far as the MDR is concerned, the first representative left without the national committee being aware of this.  And in Brussels they signed a communiqué with the RPF.  This communiqué was not as bad as all that because if those parties who were part of the government itself had made the mistake of saying -- of saying that they were going to launch a political initiative alongside the RPF against the president where as they were part of a coalition government, the RPF, on the other hand, had signed saying that it would give up the armed struggle in favour of a political struggle.  

So, with the advent of this communiqué, the war was over.  However, they were still in Brussels when they heard the news of the RPF attack on Byumba, and they came back without saying anything.  

At that moment in time I was traveling to Brussels, too, to deal with some private business, and at the same time my political party had requested that I enter into contact with the political party in Belgium, in Europe, that is, in order to put in place a certain form of collaboration or cooperation.  And it was when I was in Brussels, when I saw the climate prevailing there, that I met two individuals, two personalities from the RPF, Pastor Bizimungu, who was -- I shall spell it.  B-I-Z-I-M-U-N-G-U -- who was a president of the republic, and the next day I met Bihozagara, B-I-H-O-Z-A-G-A-R-A.  

And during our discussions I had taken the RPF communiqué with me, the communiqué which had been published in October of the year 1990, that is, where they said that they had attacked in order to introduce democracy within Rwanda.  

And I was asking why this attack had occurred whilst we had negotiated and whether democracy existed in Rwanda or not now.  At that moment in time, neither one or the other was able to give me a convincing answer on the subject.  And it was at that moment in time that I started to say to myself that either the RPF was not in control of its army, or its army, or the head of its army, had personal ambitions which exceeded those of the RPF.  But, for the country, the result was the same and war was still raging.  

And subsequently it was shown that every time that negotiations were underway there was a blockage for some reason or other, stalemate, and then there was a new attack on the part of the RPF.  So, as far as I was concerned, in this context of the war, the RPF or the chief of its army had a hidden agenda, which was difficult to control. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I think it is time to take the afternoon break.  I would, therefore, invite the Trial Chamber to so order.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I'm on my feet just to enquire at this stage if my learned friend is able to say whether I will be cross-examining this witness this afternoon.  The reason I ask is because, if so, I've got some photocopying to do.  But if the reality is if he is going to take us through to half past 5 and Your Honours are not going to sit later than that, then I know where I stand.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. Morley, I invite you to take all due measures to cross-examine the witness when I will have finished later. 
MR. MORLEY:
Well, that's most unhelpful.  My learned friends know that this witness is taken out of turn, and I'm trying to accommodate my learned friends and the hearing.  And if the learned friend does know that he is going to take the rest of the afternoon, he would assist me.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. Morley, I think I was clear when I said take due measures when I finish, so that would only mean that I will finish at the end of the afternoon.  It is, therefore, possible that I shall finish before the end of the afternoon, which is why I say, do what you must all the more so, as you have seen, Mr. Witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I would put a favourable interpretation on Mr. Morley's question.  I had suggested earlier today that we would expect the Prosecutor would behave courteously and ensure that the materials he was going to use in cross-examination was provided in good time.  I would tend to draw the conclusion that Mr. Morley's question is in response to those remarks and that he is trying to make an effort to comply with that.  So, you could indicate what's your estimate of the remainder of your cross-examination.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, it's hard for me to say, but what I am sure of is that it is quite possible that I will have finished before half past 5.  It might be 5 p.m.  It might be better that he should do what is necessary as of now.  It all depends on the witness's answers.  And you have seen that the witness can be very concise.  Perhaps Mr. Morley thinks that I'm going to use the whole afternoon until 1730.  I'm saying no, he'd better prepare his documents and be ready before the end of the afternoon.  Have I been clear, Mr. President? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Sow.  

Will there be any other defence lawyers examining this witness? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, that is a very difficult question for Ngirumpatse's defence because the witness presently in the box, in the witness box, is also on Mathieu Ngirumpatse's list of witnesses.  

Now, under the conditions in which the witness is testifying, we feel as though we are between a rock and a hard place.  We will have to put some questions that's stemming from the examination-in-chief by Counsel Sow, thereby depriving us of those issues on which we would require views or undertake a full examination, which we have not -- which we are not fully prepared for.  So I'm a bit on the horns of a dilemma.  To sacrifice Mr. Ngirumpatse's position to reserve the right to call back the witness when we present Mr. Ngirumpatse's case, we are in a difficult situation.  And the Trial Chamber knows this is not the only witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, I can sort of assist in removing certain elements of doubt.  The Chamber has the view that, as a matter of law and good practice, that it is only in exceptional cases you will be able to re-call a witness who has already testified for another defendant.  So that's not going to be a general practice which we will support.  So that clarifies one point.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, perhaps you have noted moreover that it is in that context that our position has not been systematic.  We have examined Karemera witnesses who were, nonetheless, on our list.  But there are some witnesses for which the situation is more complex.  I did understand it was not a general position of principle but would be on a case-by-case basis.  And for the witness presently testifying, we are faced with a real dilemma.  It might be better for us to ask for the Trial Chamber's leave to call him back as an exception to the practice, which you have noted, on our part we have cross-examined.  But for this witness our position is a bit complicated, a bit different.  It's not a question of principle, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, we have just gotten news that Ms. Graham will not be available at 3:30.  So the meeting with the Kalimanzira team will not take place until 5:30.  What our present understanding of the situation is is that we will be sitting tomorrow in Kalimanzira and that we will be sitting Monday, Tuesday and possibly Wednesday on Kalimanzira or -- either that or we will determine whether we will need Wednesday as well.  And then the remainder of the week will be devoted to completing the Karemera witnesses.  

So we also have to make an assessment of the duration of the Karemera testimony as we would like, as far as possible, to work towards concluding the Karemera witnesses next week, in which case counsel will have to assist the Court in identifying the duration of the examination so that we can decide whether one and a half days is sufficient, or we may need two and a half days.  But we will try and make a decision later this afternoon after we've met with Kalimanzira. 
MR. MORLEY:
Yes, I am grateful for that indication.  And may I also mention that this witness, in light of what Mr. Weyl said, and whether, on reflection, Mr. Weyl will conduct through his opportunity to cross-examine the witness, the examination he would wish to conduct in respect of the Ngirumpatse defence -- this witness could -- could be a bit longer than the scheduled timing.  And I say that because it is also possible, depending on how the Prosecution cross-examination develops, that I will be applying to Your Honour for a bit more than simply one hour.  But it depends on how the cross-examination starts to develop.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Weyl, you are going to have to make a decision and indicate whether you're going to be examining this witness now or not.  If you decide not to examine him now, that, of course, involves a risk that you may not be able to re-call him again.  But that is a choice you should make.  You know what you think are the exceptional circumstances involved.  We do not know.  And you have to evaluate your position and make a choice.  We will take our mid afternoon recess now.  

	Was there something special, Mr. Sow? 
MR. SOW:
Yes, Mr. President.  To inform you that, apart from this witness, we have already another witness in waiting that Counsel Diagne went to see this afternoon.  Two others are expected to arrive next week.  So, apart from this witness, we will have three other witnesses.  I don't think that within two days we should be able to finish the three witnesses.  That would surprise me.  It was a way of informing the Trial Chamber so that -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you suggest that if we resume with Karemera on Wednesday that we would be able to complete the witnesses Wednesday, Thursday and Friday morning.  Or do we need to sit on Tuesday?  Do we need to start on Tuesday? 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I would have suggested Tuesday, which seems more reasonable, inasmuch as four witnesses, even should Mr. Morley exceptionally be able to begin his cross-examination today, he will not be able to finish it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I'm very sorry to have to come back to this matter, but there are two points.  The first thing is that I might be able to concretely conclude only at the end of the examination-in-chief by Counsel Sow, depending on what issues he will have raised and what he will have left out of the field of his cross-examination.  But, in any case, we have been deprived of the opportunity of meeting the witness as regards Ngirumpatse's case, and that of itself constitutes exceptional circumstances.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we think that you have ample opportunity to do so.  We have been trying to get compliance with the 72 ter rule for quite some time now, and I don't think that's an exceptional circumstance. 
MR. WEYL:
Does that mean I am authorised to meet the witness? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
He's already under oath.  His testimony has begun.  I mean I'm sure you're just -- you didn't expect a yes.  Let's take a mid afternoon recess now, about 15 minutes.
(Court recessed from 1545H to 1615H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, you may continue.  
MR. SOW:
I thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, I would like to point out to the Trial Chamber that my client Mr. Édouard Karemera has had to go to the infirmary, so he is not here for the time being but he shall be back shortly.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we were talking about the RPF as to its wish to take over power.  And I shall put the following question to you:  Was this desire -- or did this desire on the part of the RPF not cause it to infiltrate all political parties? 
A.	Yes.  I might have been coming to that in my line of thought.  However, now I shall say what I think.  And this is from experience that I am speaking.  

Since the advent of multiparty politics, I was vice president of the MDR party, vice chairman within Kigali-ville.  And there were often conflicts between the MDR youth members and the MRND youth members.  And having actively taken part in the reform of the MDR party, I can provide you with very specific examples.  

The first example is with reference to these youths.  When there were regular conflicts, especially after the weekend, there were people who came to the headquarters of the MDR party in order for us to help them to go and lodge a complaint at the Prosecutor's office.  At the outset they would say that it was the Interahamwe, until one day the deputy prosecutor said to me, "As long as you don't give me any names, there is no use in coming to vaguely accuse the Interahamwe.  It's too vague."  

And it was at that moment in time that I requested of those people to provide me with the names of their aggressors, and especially for them to provide us with a proper account of how this all started.  And it was from there that I started to see that it often started out with young people who were not very well known.  

Well, I didn't feel any alarm bells going off in my head at that point in time.  It was just suddenly I understood that we had been infiltrated, even with regards to our base.  

Now, as regards the personalities, I shall give you the -- I shall give you examples involving three high-ranking individuals within the system.  I will start with my party.  Many people gave the name of our third chairman, whom we had ousted.  However, I'm not going to talk about him.  In view of the fact that you have followed the history of everything that happened in Rwanda at the time, the government of Nsengiyaremye was deposed on the 16th of July 1993.  And until that date this gentleman, Ngurizi, N-G-U-R-I-Z-I, who was the minister of foreign affairs and who represented the government at the Arusha negotiations, at that moment in time the negotiations had virtually drawn to a close, and all the draft agreements were more or less signed.  

There were two outstanding issues, that is, to define how the integration of the armed forces was to occur and also the issue of the arrival of an RPF contingent within Kigali-ville that the minister, Ngurizi, had categorically refused until then.  

On the 16th of July at night the Uwilingiyimana government, U-W-I-L-I-N-G-I-Y-I-M-A-N-A, was put in place against the advice of the MDR.  Anastase Gasana, G-A-S-A-N-A, then became the minister of foreign affairs.  And this gentleman had incorporated the MDR party.  I believe that was in June of the year 1992.  

At the end of 1991 he was still chairman of the political committee of the MRND as a single party.  And in 1992 he was within the government.  He was secretary for the ministry of communications.  And when the multiparty government came into existence on the 16th of April 1992, I believe it took two to three months before all the various ministerial cabinets were brought together.  The ministers were there, but they were all part of different cabinets.  

Mr. Gasana, at that moment in time, realised that he would not be reappointed within any of the MRND cabinets.  And in the month of June he then joined the MDR in order to buy himself back, as it were.  And he drew up the document as to how the Interahamwe had allegedly been trained.

Now, harking back to 1993, July of that year, he became the minister of foreign affairs.  And from the very first week he was present in Arusha.  And he, of course, signs the document allowing the RPF to bring its contingent within the town of Kigali and, as I was saying at the outset, everything which occurred during that period is more or less strange, a country, that is -- which was at war and which, of its own volition, introduces the Trojan horse.  

Now I shall jump forward somewhat in my account of matters to talk about the taking of power on the part of the RPF.  Gasana is still in post as minister of foreign affairs, and after a short time he became ambassador for Rwanda with the United Nations until he is removed from his position.  And in the letter he drafted to the president of the republic, a letter expressing his chagrin, he comes to the conclusion, before signing off, if my memory serves me correctly, that is, that, "Since the year 1992, in order for me to work with the RPF, I have never spoken using hidden language."  

So, he recognises, himself, the fact that in 1992 he was already a member of the RPF, and at the same time he was MRND, MDR and RPF in passing.  

The second individual, Mr. Boniface Rucagu, spelled R-U-C-A-G-U, at the time of multiparty politics, he was a member of the MRND within Ruhengeri préfecture in a region where three préfectures came together:  Ruhengeri, Kigali and Byumba, side by side.  That is Base region, B-A-S-E.  And every time the MDR organised rallies within Ruhengeri or Gisenyi or even in some of the Byumba regions, and when we were forced to go via Base, there was always some form of conflict.  Stones were thrown at our convoy.  And despite encounters with some personalities from the MRND party with a view to calming the situation down somewhat, which worked elsewhere, in that area it never did work, and we were still accusing the MRND. 
	(Pages 46 to 54 by Claudette Ask)




















1630H
THE WITNESS (continuing):
Now, this Mr. Rucagu, who was a member of the MRND until the year 1994 and préfet, since that time, and even when the number of préfectures in the country were reduced, he still remained préfet of one of the large préfectures or sous-préfectures. 

I might be able to give you another example which is not very political in nature, but where one should ask one's self the question as to whether there was infiltration or not, that is to say, on the occasion of the attack on the presidential plane, within this very same plane was the chief of general staff of the army.  And, to date, nobody has understood why this chief of staff of the army had travelled in the company of the president of the republic to enter into negotiations of a political nature. 

And apart from his death -- due to his death, the army found itself without a chief of staff.  And in view of the fact that a certain hierarchy is respected within the army, it was not -- or, is not a difficult thing to imagine, or think that he who organised the attack, knowing full well that the chief of general staff would be on the plane, also knew the person who was going to take his place.  And the person who took his place at that moment in time was Mr. Gatsinzi -- G-A-T-S-I-N-Z-I -- was chief of general staff of the RPF, subsequently, and to date, minister of defence. 

It is rather astonishing that a chief of general staff should find himself in the other general staff at the war's end.  Those examples are few, among many, which show that we had been infiltrated.  

Allow me to cite another one which brought about a negative response on the part of all members of the government.  It's between July and September 1991, under the single-party rule of the MRND, but multipartyism had begun.  A minister of that government by the name of Nzabahimana, François Nzabahima -- N-Z-A-B-A-H-I-M-A-N-A -- drafted a document calling -- the aim of it was to refuse verbal aggression in the course of rallies.  His idea was to get it signed by many people before publishing it in order to try and tone down the violence expressed in speeches. 

He, at the time, had started getting MRND bourgmestres to sign it.  I'd also started getting MDR people to sign it.  That day I'd obtained a signature of -- signatures of five members of the national committee.  I had obtained the signature of Ndasingwa, Landouald, in particular, from the PL, and Ngago.  Ndasingwa is spelt N-D-A-S-I-N-G-W-A.  Ngago is spelt N-G-A-G-O.  And we were supposed to go on collecting signatures, and each one had committed himself to doing so. 

On that day, I was going -- due to go to work in the southwest of the country in Cyangugu, so I started out, which means I couldn't go on with collecting the signatures.  But it so happens that the next day, among the four parties, the MRND, the MDR, the PL and the PSD, meetings of their respective politburos were held and everyone condemned the document.  Those of the MRND said that Nzabahimana had been had by us from the MDR, had been fooled by us.  Those of the PL and the PSD said that they had been fooled by the MRND people. 

It's not difficult to come to the conclusion that the party whose interest it was that there be confusion in the country, as demonstrated subsequently, was the RPF, or was at the head of its army. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Thank you for your explanations, Witness. 

Tell me, do you know one Augustin Iyamuremye?  Spelt I-Y-A-M-U-R-E-M-Y-E. 
A.	Yes, I know him. 
Q.	Could you consider him as being among those that you have exemplified as infiltrators? 
A.	Of course, when you see his -- the course of his actions.  In the multiparty government, he was, I think, in charge of security at the prime minister's office.  That also leads -- gives rise to some surprise, when you see the heads of an intelligence security unit body in the government of the party that was at war with the others. 
Q.	Witness, now, with hindsight, is it reasonable to consider that the RPF planned all that very well? 
A.	I did not quite understand the question. 
Q.	Let me put it afresh.  With hindsight, in view of the ceasefire agreement systematically violated by the RPF, with the infiltrations, the assassination of the president of the republic, is it reasonable to consider that the RPF had planned it all and knew very well what would happen after the 6th of April? 
A.	It's obvious and certain that the RPF planned it all.  Even after the president was sworn in, there was, 
	I think, three other attempts to have his swearing-in ceremony.  It was always said that that was a result of the schism between, in particular, the MDR and PL parties.  Without going into those schisms, I should like to say that I was present, since I was supposed to be sworn in as an MP in the course of all those attempts to hold swearing-in ceremonies.  Because it was always said that the president of the republic had prevented -- had put obstacles in the way of holding those swearing-in ceremonies. 

The RPF MPs and their ministers never came to any of those attempts at holding those ceremonies, 
so how could I accept that it was Habyarimana who was preventing things from happening, since it was the RPF that never accepted to come to those attempts at holding the required ceremonies?  

So, in my eyes, it is my point of view, especially after seeing what has been written by the RPF, which merely strengthens my point of view, the RPF or, perhaps, the head of their army -- because I'm not sure that the RPF politicians were aware of all those preparations.  Nonetheless, it was the RPF who had planned it all, to hold all the power through the army as of 1990, to hold the totality of power. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 

Witness, it was general knowledge that between the MRND and the MDR, there was a fierce political struggle.  I should like to ask you whether you, as someone who knew what was going on and followed MDR political activities, did you hear MRND leaders call for the extermination of Tutsi, either in their speeches or in their communiqués?  
A.	The only case in which someone from the MRND called for the extermination of Tutsis, and even of people of the MDR, was Mugesere, I think was his name -- M-U-G-E-S-E-R-E -- in a speech made in Gisenyi.  Even -- but that was at the outset of multiparty politics, and he was even punished by the MRND.  But after that, I never heard any ethnic speech or other by -- of the MRND.  But I would like to point out that I left Rwanda on --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
Please, I'm sorry, could you repeat that date, the date on which he left Rwanda?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I'm sorry, Mr. Sow, the interpreters would wish him to repeat the date on which he left Rwanda. 
MR. SOW:  
That's what I was about to ask him, Mr. President. 
THE WITNESS:  
I did not understand the question. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, could you tell us the date on which you left Rwanda? 
A.	I left Rwanda on the 4th of April 1994. 
Q.	Thank you. 

Now, let us speak of the protest march held as a result of the killing of President Ndadaye of Burundi.  Witness, after the murder of President Ndadaye of Burundi, a march that culminated in a rally at Nyamirambo stadium -- N-Y-A-M-I-R-A-M-B-O -- was organised on the 23rd of October 1993 in Kigali.  Can you confirm that?  
A.	Yes, I can, because it was I, myself, that organised that march. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us who went about obtaining the necessary permit for the march and who from? 
A.	Well, as any demonstration organised in Kigali, it was I who requested the permit for my party, since I was organising demonstrations even -- we were with the other parties of the coalition.  I can't speak of opposition when we are all in the same government.  It is I who organised the demonstrations.  So after Ndadaye died -- was killed, I wrote a letter to the préfet of Kigali urban préfecture asking for a permit to organise a march in memory of President Ndadaye between the town centre, as far as 
	Nyamirambo stadium.  

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
You've already spelt that proper noun. 
THE WITNESS:  
So that day we had exchanged correspondence three times with the préfet in the course of the day, whereby he was refusing the permit.  

I should recall one thing here, something which happened before.  The 22nd or 23rd of July 1993, 
the Kabusunzu congress -- Kabusunzu, K-A-B-U-N-S-U -- no, sorry -- B-U-S-U-N-Z-U, Kabusunzu. 
The congress, in the course of which we threw out Twagiramungu, T-W-A-G-I-M-U-N-G-U (sic), 
and Uwilingiyimana, Agathe, U-W-I-L-N-G-I-M-A-N-A (sic), and all the others whom we threw out of the party. 

On that day, the MRND and the president of the republic were with Twagiramungu and Uwilingiyimana against us, and did all they could to prevent us from proceeding with our activities.  Even the cabinet had found a trick whereby communiqués we wanted to issue on the radio, the national radio, were prevented by decreeing that, henceforth, it was the party president who has to sign communiqués due for broadcasting on the radio. 

And among the arguments put forward by the préfet, that one resurfaced.  But I argued that the march I was organising was being organised by the Kigali urban section of the MDR.  

After the third exchange of correspondence, I received a phone call from the préfecture telling me that the préfet wanted to see me.  I went to his office, which is when he told me that he was ready to grant me the permit if I accepted that the other parties join us in the march.  I was forthwith very pleased, 
but I told him, "I must consult the other members of the bureau."  

Indeed, the argument in favour of my accepting the other members of the bureau accepted, and that reason was, we'd already finished preparations for our party communiqué, in brief, stating what is happening in Burundi where the democratically elected president, that the international -- and the international community welcomed those elections; such a president gets killed and the international community keeps quiet about it.  We said that is very much like what's happening here in our own country, where our party takes decisions and the president of the MRND rejects them. 

The president of the republic and the president of the MRND -- no, no -- the party as a whole, the bureau rejected them.  I went on to say that we can even win the elections, and then our candidate would be killed, as occurred in Burundi. 

So, as the préfet was suggesting, the MRND people could come along, and that our communiqués were no longer being broadcast.  I said, "Well, this is the occasion to say it."  And the bureau accepted, asking me to lay down the condition that there should be no joint communiqué.  Each party would come and give his own communiqué.  And the monitors of the march would be ensured by ourselves, 
the MDR. 

The préfet accepted, and the march went ahead all the way to Nyamirambo stadium.  We were in charge of protocol.  So I spoke a few words of greeting, and then we went on to the communiqués of the parties present with their Kigali section heads.  For other parties, we introduced the members of those parties who had joined us in our demonstration. 

I was vice president for Kigali urban.  I gave the communiqué to Karamira -- K-A-R-A-M-I-R-A -- who was the president, chairman for the MDR in Kigali urban, who was also second vice president at the national level.  But as to -- as he was -- as the president of Kigali urban was present, it was not up to the vice chairman or vice president to read the communiqué when the chairman himself, the president himself, was there on the spot present. 

So, he said to me, "Since you prepared it together with the bureau," he had not been able to come, 
he was in another meeting the day before, he said to me, "you go ahead and read it, and then I will take the floor to make a short speech."  

So then the chairman of Kigali urban préfecture, who had read out his communiqué in a very good manner -- in view of the circumstances, I then read the communiqué, which gained a standing ovation.  And, subsequently, we then gave the floor to Karamira, who said a few words of welcome himself.  
And the speech he made was not in line with party politics, because in that speech he made mention of Hutu power.  And I still say, with hindsight, that Karamira's analysis was a correct one, in the sense that the president of Burundi had been killed because he was a Hutu.  But the solution that Karamira was announcing publicly was not the correct one, saying that he had been killed because he was a Hutu.  But in a democracy, this doesn't exist, either. 

So, we could not base ourselves on the word "Hutu", because then we would have all remained members of one single party, because Hutus represented 85 per cent of the population, and we might have all remained, therefore, members of one and -- of one and the same party. 

So, in repeating this word -- well, just before thanking people for having come, as organiser, I said, "Thank you" and "Goodbye", and I reminded him of the democratic principles saying that ethnicity, race or religion has nothing to do with it, and that it is democracy that one should support.  And I went on to add that after the coup d'état, which saw the second republic come into existence, a short time thereafter, we heard the news, and there was even a trial conducted involving approximately 60 people, that is to say, dignitaries from the first republic.  And amongst those 60 people, I can say that more than 95 per cent of them were Hutus, whereas the regime of the second republic was also majority Hutu. 

So, this is the example I have given with a view to reminding you that democracy must be universal and not based on ethnicity.  And from that moment on, our adversaries within the party, in view of the fact that we were still struggling for legitimacy, more than 80 per cent of the national congress and the others, that is to say, Twagiramungu et al, supported by the president of the republic and the MRND party, but from that moment on, Twagiramungu launched a campaign using the words of "Hutu power" against us. 
BY MR. SOW:  
Q.	I thank you for the explanation.  I shall come back to the term "Hutu power", which has been opposed to the term "moderate Hutu".  

However, in view of the fact that we were still talking about the Nyamirambo stadium, can you please tell us who represented the MRND party there?  
A.	As I said, I organised this march as representative of MDR for Kigali urban préfecture, and as I also said, he who read out the MRND communiqué for Kigali urban district was the chairman of the MRND party for Kigali urban district, Jean-Baptiste Habyarimana, his name was.  H-A-B-Y-I-M-A-N-A -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
-- says the witness.  
THE WITNESS:  
So he is the one who read out the MRND communiqué. 
BY MR. SOW:  
Q.	Are there any other parties which were represented at the préfectural level, and did they read out any communiqués?  And, if so, could you please also give us their names? 
A.	When the préfet obliged me to involve the other parties, he had named - or, mentioned the MRND and CDR parties.  So the chairman for the CDR party within Kigali urban district was also in attendance.  
	I started -- or, attempted to phone the members of the PSD or PL parties, as always, but those parties, also, at that moment in time, were supporting Twagiramungu against us, for reasons that I might not have time to explain here.  So I was only able to enter into contact with those number of commune office members who were introduced.  And I did not accept that they make -- or, read a communiqué, in view of the fact that they did not represent the town level. 
Q.	Witness, could you tell us whether Mr. Édouard Karemera took part in the march? 
A.	I believe, according to what I have explained here, that somebody representing the MRND party at national level could not come and take part in our demonstration by virtue of his or her position as a leader.  

However, to provide you with a positive response -- or, a negative response, in fact, Édouard Karemera was not there.  There were only members of Kigali urban district MRND members who were there.
(Pages 55 to 61 by Joe Reynosa)

































1715H 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Was Édouard Karemera present at the Nyamirambo stadium at the time of the gathering when the communiqués were read out? 
A.	No, nor did he attend the march. 
Q.	Witness, we have talked about Hutu Power during this gathering, and you went on to specify how this was done.  Hutu Power, from that moment, is a term opposed -- or used as the opposite to moderate Hutu.  This opposition -- can you tell us whether there was a true basis for this opposition of terminology, and what did the Hutu moderates represent -- or the moderate Hutus? 
A.	I did, indeed, explain that from the time of this meeting, the Twagiramungu wing started to use words uttered by Karemera against us.  I did not say that during the secretariat meeting for Kigali-urban district the next day, we broached the subject and Karemera recognised the mistake.  

However, in order to come back to Twagiramungu, whilst things were moving forward, he could see that he did not have any support whatsoever within the party.  And the use of the slogan, "Power", had started within the MDR party, and we used to use the term "MDR Power" to say that we have the power of the party and that they are only there representing themselves.  

When Karemera coined this term with reference to the Hutus and the MRND and the MDR, it no longer had any meaning.  So I shall come back to the subject of Twagiramungu in order to say that the term moderate Hutu came into existence after April 1994.  And to my mind it is like in all societies, you have normal individuals and you have the individuals who are extremists.  So to say to me that they who represented approximately 10 per cent were moderates, and to say that the others were the extremists, well, I would like to know where the other majority is to be found.  

To be clear:  The term moderate Hutu does not exist, and extremist Hutus -- as for any of the cases in any race or any political party -- this exists.  And after Twagiramungu left the RPF -- the RPF government, that is, since that time those Hutus who are part of the RPF, he calls them "convenience Hutus".

I would give you another example which shows to what degree the moderate Hutus did not exist.  There was a struggle for positions and each person was grappling for what he could put his hands on, and 
I can provide you with an example, because after the division of the MDR party, the bishops' college organised conciliation meetings between the MDR political bureau and Twagiramungu and consorts, and I was part of it.  

I have here the list of those individuals who were in attendance at that meeting.  I obtained this list from the Tribunal when I was testifying in another trial, so you would be able to find the names of those individuals in a document provided by the Tribunal.  Those who were in attendance -- that is to say, on the side of Twagirumungu, there was initially Twagiramungu himself; Agathe Uwilingiyimana, we've already spelt that; and Jean-Marie Vianney Mbonimpa, M-B-O-N-I-M-P-A; there was Anastase Gasana, we have mentioned him and there was Ntakirutimana, spelt N-T-A-K-I-R-U-T-I-M-A-N-A.  

If I look at this list, Twagiramungu was in exile in Belgium; Uwilingiyimana, unfortunately, was killed; Mbonimpa, former ambassador of the RPF government is currently in exile in Switzerland; 
Anastase Gasana, whom we have mentioned, is in exile in the United States; Ntakirutimana is in exile in the Netherlands.  

Now, had they been moderates, why are they no longer with the RPF?  No.  It is that both -- they could no longer work with the RPF, subsequently.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I have now finished my examination-in-chief of this witness.

And I would like to thank you, Mr. Witness, for having answered my various questions.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Sow.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I can see you snickering.  I would not like to interpret your snicker. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I'm not sure whether I should say it or you should say it, but you did keep your promise. 
MR. SOW:
Much obliged, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I can see that it is 17:25 and might the Trial Chamber allow me to reserve my answer that -- to that question so that it be in line with that of the lead counsel, because I believe that were I to conduct a cross-examination, it would not be any lengthier than five minutes.  And I believe that it would be hazardous to commence it at 25 minutes past 5 in such conditions and I would request that the 
Trial Chamber allow me to -- allow the lead counsel to give the answer to that question when we resume on Tuesday morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you, Mr. Weyl, we will grant your application.  

Mr. Nimy, what about you? 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I have no questions to put to this witness and I thank you.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I would like to thank the Trial Chamber for the decision it has just made with reference to my application.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, we --
MR. MORLEY:
May I offer a thought? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Certainly.  
MR. MORLEY:
The witness is in the box and he has given testimony by way of examination-in-chief in respect of Karemera.  If we are going to adjourn now until a date next week, I have discussed with my learned leader, subject to Your Honour's consideration, that this may be an exceptional circumstance, given that Mr. Weyl has in mind calling this witness at some point, that although -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, we -- Mr. Weyl has changed his mind.  He's going to examine him today.  
He's going to examine him now.
MR. MORLEY:
He's going to start now?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well -- well, after the adjournment, he wants to reserve his position overnight.  I understood that he just wanted -- and he wanted to discuss with his learned leader before commencing what he thought was going to be a very short examination.  
MR. MORLEY:
Well, what I was contemplating -- I see Mr. Weyl is on his feet.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, that was not quite what my application was about at an earlier stage.  I do not know of whether we are going to question the witness or whether we shall request of the Trial Chamber the -- the allowance to be able to call him back again.  And this is why I wanted to discuss this with 
Counsel Hounkpatin, because it is not a given that we will not request to call the witness once again as I am not able to give you a definitive decision right now.  
MR. MORLEY:
If I may develop the thought I had.  It may be that this is one of those rare occasions that although the witness is in the witness box, counsel -- Mr. Weyl and if necessary, Mr. Nimy -- can approach this witness and discuss what evidence it is that he would give were he being called a witness for either Ngirumpatse or Nzirorera.  So that we don't end up in a situation where there is an application being made that he is recalled simply because either counsel has not had an opportunity to discuss with him the testimony he might give in respect of their defendants.  

And I make this observation for Your Honours' assistance in order ultimately to save time and money, and applications and arguments about whether or not this witness may be recalled.  

It's a matter for Your Honours' judgement.  Ordinarily once a witness is in the witness box, he cannot be approached by anyone.  But in light of the development of the discussion, Your Honours may think that over the next four days, he hasn't been cross-examined by the Prosecution, yet there might be in 
Your Honours' mind an appropriateness to his being approached by counsel for Ngirumpatse and, if necessary, counsel for Nzirorera.  In that way, we avoid arguments about recalling him. 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I apologise.  I'm somewhat surprised by Mr. Morley's proposal.  A witness who is under oath cannot be approached by all and sundry and even we, who have called him to testify, cannot enter into discussion with him.  So I do not understand.  
MR. MORLEY:
For clarity, it's not all and sundry.  It's specifically counsel for Ngirumpatse and/or counsel for Nzirorera.  In the peculiar circumstance which has developed before the courtroom, which, if I must say, I found surprising because ordinarily when a witness is called, counsel deals with the witness before the Chamber, and doesn't make applications to recall him at some other time.  So to try and assist -- if 
Your Honours are of the mind, exceptionally so that we don't have this problem develop either now or ever again, my learned friends will understand that whenever a witness is called, they cannot say that, "Ooh, I'd like to call him separately later." 

And, to avoid an argument that they haven't been able to see him yet, the Prosecution would not oppose they being able to see him over the next few days in order to conduct their examinations of this witness.  It's a matter for Your Honours' consideration.  It may be unattractive, but I hope Your Honours will see we're trying to help.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, we have felt to some extent that the Prosecutor, by his indication that in these exceptional circumstances, the Prosecutor would not suffer prejudice if Ngirumpatse's counsel and/or Nzirorera's counsel had an opportunity to organise the examination-in-chief of the witness, we feel that in the particular circumstances of this case and in light of our -- our inclination against the idea of a recall of a witness, in general, it might be that Mr. Weyl would be obliged to conduct his examination-in-chief when we -- when we resume.  And, perhaps, it would be in the interests of providing adequate facilities for his proper -- the proper defence of his client that this arrangement may be -- may be suitable.  Would you have any objection if we gave him that opportunity? 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I must admit that I'm faced with a difficulty which is as follows:  If the Trial Chamber decides that Counsel Weyl -- Mathieu Ngirumpatse's team could no longer recall the witness, and he himself wishes to undertake examination of the witness, the question you've put to me is already answered.  But I must admit that under such conditions, the question I'm putting to myself is that we, who have called this witness, should we not be there, be present -- whereas the witness is under oath?  

All that strikes me being -- as being a bit complicated, Mr. President, and whatever the exceptional circumstances might be, I think there is a serious problem because this witness -- it is us who have called him.  Even if other members of the Defence wish to question him, once he is under oath, I think that if he must be heard, we would also need to be present at that meeting with the witness.  And that is the difficulty for us because I've just finished my examination-in-chief.  I should like also to be able to thoroughly master the situation.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, without wishing to establish a precedent, I shall speak some kind words to Mr. Morley.  
I'm highly appreciative of the suggestion he's made to the Trial Chamber, which is along the lines of what I was suggesting before.  When you had said, Mr. President, that it was not possible to allow contacts to be made in the course of testimony -- but I would not like to, at this point, having agreed to a facility which, Mr. Sow has pointed out, does give rise to difficulties, that Mr. Morley should seize the opportunity tomorrow or subsequently to put a suggestion that we have accepted this proposal, which would put in doubt the credibility of the witness.  

I don't wish to cast a doubt on the good faith of Mr. Morley's suggestion, but there might be tomorrow or subsequently, a problem in the continued examination of the witness -- and, in respect of who he has contact with or not, and we do not wish to put -- add any additional doubt or a possible doubt -- or open the door to possible doubt as to the credibility of the witness and the validity of his oath.  In other words, the bridal arrangement seems too perfect. 
MR. MORLEY:
"Bridal arrangements" -- we seem to be doing very well.  Three thoughts:  Firstly, I know my learned friends are men and women of integrity.  I don't anticipate that there are credibility issues which will arise from the invitation being offered by the Prosecution.  It would be odd for the Prosecution to then try and renege upon the invitation offered.  

Secondly, the protection order having been revoked, this is a public witness, and Your Honours may feel that there's the old adage, there is no property in a witness.  So that the witness is not the property of Mr. Sow, as it were, for the purposes of the other two counsel in this exceptional circumstance being seen -- or seeing the witness.  

But having said that, the third thought is we have no objection to Mr. Sow sitting in with my learned friends -- if that would make him feel more comfortable.  Our primary concern is to ensure that 
Your Honours are not troubled by applications which are unfortunate to have witnesses recalled who could otherwise be dealt with when they're here, now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, do I -- do I interpret your remarks as an indication that you would prefer not to meet with the witness over the weekend, in light of everything that has been said?  And your -- your -- the points you made earlier? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I prefer nothing.  I'm faced, as is the Trial Chamber, with this specific difficulty due to the presence of the same witness on two lists; one being that of a Defence that has begun its case, and the other on the list of a Defence that has not yet begun.  

We have a particular difficulty.  I must admit I am as perplexed as is the Trial Chamber.  I should not like to compromise Édouard Karemera's defence by initiatives that would render fragile the submission of his evidence for -- for myriad reasons.  But to the extent that it might be slightly prejudicial to my 
case -- my defence of Mathieu Ngirumpatse is a point I must also bear in mind.  And the Trial Chamber should -- must, of course, allow each defendant in a joint trial all the rights he is entitled to as an individual trial.  And that is specifically evident here where the constraints apparently are difficult to reconcile.

1745H 
MR. WEYL:
To be quite complete, to be full in my answer.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have to take our adjournment now.  We have a -- we scheduled a status conference with Kalimanzira and we are a little bit late for it already.  What I propose is that we'll resolve this tomorrow morning.  If counsel would meet us in the Judges' lounge at 08:45, we would then resolve this matter that way --
MR. MORLEY:
Very well, thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- before commencing our hearing in Kalimanzira, and that would give us an opportunity to discuss next week's scheduling.
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.

Mr. Witness, we have to take our adjournment now.  We are not certain exactly when you would be recalled, but you will be notified by the registrar.  You have heard the discussions, so you know what is involved in this issue.  

I must inform you that while you are a witness, during this or any other adjournment, you are not to discuss the case -- well, I withdraw that because we are still considering giving you permission to discuss your testimony -- your proposed testimony with counsel in this case as an exceptional basis.  But the discussion you have heard is that it's a normal rule in our proceedings that once a witness has been sworn in to testify, he should not discuss the case or his testimony with anybody.  

But you've heard the discussions and, for exceptional reasons, an exception is being considered at the moment.  But we will make our decision tomorrow morning, and you will be duly informed.  

We take our adjournment now.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Will you need interpreters tomorrow morning, Mr. President, excuse me?
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, we are not -- it is not going to be in the courtroom.  We will be meeting in the Judges' lounge.
But if you -- well, in fact, why should I refuse a generous offer?  It may facilitate our meeting.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Very well, sir.  	
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
(Court adjourned at 1749H)
