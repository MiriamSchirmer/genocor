P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody.

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. KOUAMBO-TCHINDA:
Thank you, Mr. President.

Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberado Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, the 26th of August 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the 
Prosecutor versus Édouard Karemera and Mathieu Ngirampatse, Case No. ICTR 98-44-T. 

Thank you, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.

The appearances are the same.

Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Your testimony will continue.  You remain under the same oath to tell the truth.

You're not hearing me?  
THE WITNESS:
No. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Registrar, could you assist, please.

Okay.  Mr. Witness, is that any better?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, much better. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Very well.  I was just telling you that your testimony will continue.  Mr. Webster will continue with his cross-examination.  And you remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began yesterday.  You understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I do. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Good morning, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.

Mr. President, yesterday -- by the way, thank you for giving me the floor.  Yesterday we broke off when Mr. Webster was referring to something that somehow disturbed me.  He said the following to the witness:  "Did you not make any statement previously?  And I'm referring to your statements of 
October 2003."  

Let me say that I am not aware of those statements and no statement of 2003 was disclosed, and I therefore seek clarification on that point.  Is there any statement which may or may have not been disclosed to us, a statement of October 2003?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Good morning to everyone.

In response to Mr. Weyl, no, there is no statement.  In fact, Mr. Weyl questioned this witness and asked him specifically if he made a statement, signed statement, when he spoke to an OTP team in 2003 and the witness's response was no.  

And that information to the best of my knowledge is accurate.  I was actually asking him if he said anything.  That's what I meant when I used the word "statement".  

So I hope the matter is clear now.  And then -- 
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you for that clarification, Mr. Webster.  Maybe, indeed, the way you couched the question should be -- the way you couch questions should be more specific and therefore not refer to statements that may exist or may not exist.  So the truth of the matter is that there is no such statement.  And I 
thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
There is no written statement, but the witness -- I'm putting to him that he made oral statements back in October 2003.  

And then, Your Honours, my eyesight is not the best, but I don't think I see Mr. Karemera in the courtroom.  If that's the case, it should be reflected on the record. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Diagne, I think Mr. Webster's accurate.  Mr. Karemera is not here this morning?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
As you can see, Mr. President.  I do not think that you have any problems with your own sight to be so despiteful (sic).  

By the way, what was Mr. Webster saying about the presence or absence of Mr. Karemera?  What problems does he have with that, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Diagne, as a matter of courtesy, I think the matter should be reflected on the record.  We had received previously written notices from Mr. Karemera that he was not attending court and that you were representing him on his behalf.  We did not receive such a written notice this morning, and it may be just appropriate for you to confirm that that is the position. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
I did not either, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I don't understand your response.  

Do you confirm that you are representing Mr. Karemera here this morning?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, yes, I can confirm that.  But I'm somewhat surprised, because I'm here for something, am I not?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Thank you.

We'll proceed -- the trial will proceed in Mr. Karemera's absence.
GUSTAVE MBONYUMUTWA,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued) 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Good morning to you, Mr. Witness.  
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	I heard the "bonjour" in French, but I did not here anything from the English booth but -- 
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	Yesterday you told us that back in July 1994, before you left Rwanda, that you knew that Tutsi were being systematically targeted and killed; right? 
A.	I said that yesterday to you?  
Q.	You're asking a question of me? 
A.	Yes, because you're asking me to confirm whether I said so yesterday. 
Q.	Yes.  I think that's where we left off in your examination yesterday.  I can read the transcript to you, but we left off talking about what you knew prior to leaving Rwanda in July 1994.  And my suggestion to you then was that you really didn't realise the extent and the systematic nature of the killing.  I believe you contradicted me and said that you did.  So I'm just trying to pick up where we left off by confirming your last response on the record yesterday, so you can simply clarify that point, and I'll move forward.

And by the way, Mr. Witness, I repeated your answer, not because I was trying to be provocative but because on the record what you say didn't -- you know, it wouldn't have been obvious on the written record that you were asking me a question.  It could have been taken as a response as it's transcribed.  So please don't mistake the way I'm asking you questions for any disrespect.

I see Mr. Weyl is on his feet.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I have a concern.  Maybe there's a problem with interpretation or maybe Mr. Webster does not remember what the witness said yesterday.  In fact, maybe he should read out the statement from the witness yesterday.  Because what he has asserted this morning is exactly the contrary of what the witness said yesterday.  He's asserting that -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Mr. Weyl.  This is a matter which the witness is the best person to clarify.  
Really, he should confirm or refute what Mr. Webster has put to him. 
THE WITNESS:
Yesterday, in fact, a number of questions were put to me by Mr. Webster, very complicated questions, to the extent that he asked me to confirm or deny his understanding of the answers that I provided orally in October 2007 -- rather, 2003, some seven years ago.  

Clearly, his understanding and my answers of yesterday are still not clear enough.  With his leave, he can get clearer answers from me if he puts clear and specific questions to me without referring to a conversation of 2003 whose exact content I must confess I no longer clearly remember. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Okay.  My apologies to you, Mr. Witness.  We'll try and take the issue --  tackle the issue again. 

	Before you left Rwanda in June of 1994, were you aware of the systematic and targeted nature of the killings and the extent of the killings? 
A.	Yes, when I left Rwanda I was already aware of some information that killings were taking place or had taken place, and that one of the reasons for such killings was in relation to people belonging to the Tutsi ethnic group. 
Q.	Did you also know that Hutu who were politically opposed to the MRND were also being systematically targeted and killed? 
A.	When I left in 1994, the Hutus who were systematically targeted and killed were those who were pro-RPF but not necessarily anti-MRND. 
Q.	But, in any case, you were aware prior to leaving Rwanda in June 1994 that Hutu who were pro-RPF were being systematically targeted and killed? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So what you later learned when you went to Belgium was just a matter of the volume or the magnitude of the killings that had taken place; is that accurate? 
A.	Yes, the information we received subsequently dealt with several aspects, including the scope as well as the nature of the killings and also the historical background to the situation.  So at that time we became aware of more information as to the context in which those killings had taken place. 
Q.	Did you ever tell that team of OTP lawyers, Tribunal lawyers, back in October 2003 that you and 
	your peer group -- and when I refer to your peer group, I'm talking about your age mates, your siblings, your brothers and sisters and friends -- never knew about the extent of the killings and didn't believe the reports that you heard over the radio about those killings because you were told that all of that was just RPF propaganda.  Do you recall saying that before? 
A.	What do you mean by that -- all that?  
Q.	Well, let me just go straight to the point, Mr. Witness.  What I'm suggesting to you is that when you spoke to OTP lawyers back in October 2003 you had a different way of describing your understanding of what was going on in Rwanda in 1994.  And my suggestion to you is that you were very sheltered and that for you your trip to Gitarama and then your trip to Gisenyi seemed liked an extended vacation because you were barbecuing on the beach side and you were just staying at home and you didn't have a full appreciation of the killings that were going on around the country.  So tell us now if that's accurate or not. 
A.	If -- if you are indeed putting that question to me again -- and then let me say that, yes, indeed, in Rwanda between the time we got to Murambi on the 12th of April and the time of our departure things were very, very contradictory and paradoxical because at some point it was every man for himself and there was great insecurity and people were fleeing to places of refuge.  

So it is very possible that I may have told your investigators that when we arrived in Gisenyi we were struck by the contrast we observed when compared to the chaos we had experienced in Kigali or Gitarama.  But when we got to Gisenyi, the situation was quite different, because the situation was quite different from where we had been before.  And there were not as many killings as we had experienced in the two other towns we had left before getting to Gisenyi.  

So we were quite surprised to see that people were living ordinary lifestyles, going to the beach and going to the market ordinarily.  So it is not surprising that I may have referred that scenario to your investigators. 
Q.	Well, that is what I was getting at with my previous series of questions.  Because my information, or the information that's been made available to me, is that you really didn't know what was going on in the country until you actually left Rwanda, that you spent a good part of your time on the beach barbecuing, that even in Gitarama you had no idea of the extent of the killing until it was reported to you in Belgium.  
A.	Well, I do not agree with you.  I did not say that I was taking part in any barbecues or that I went to the beach.  What I said clearly was what we were surprised that the atmosphere which I have just described was obtaining in Gisenyi.  So let me make that point very clear.  

Now, as to the information that I was aware of, yes, indeed, in early June, late May 1994, I was not aware of all these things.  The kind of information that I -- that I subsequently became aware -- available to me and which has increased to this very date.  So that is my answer. 
Q.	And the information that you have about Mathieu Ngirumpatse during the period 
	April, May, June and July 1994 is really exclusively based on what you saw and heard in his house on the 7th and 8th and 9th of April; isn't that so? 
A.	The most striking fact actually happened between the 7th and the 12th of April, I would say, because we met again on the 12th of April in Murambi.  I believe that when we were still in Gitarama I heard some news about the family but more family news than political news.  Then thereafter I did not receive any other information relating to Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse's political activities. 
Q.	In fact, you didn't see him again after the 12th of April; isn't that so? 
A.	It is possible that I may have seen him on one or two other occasions when I went to Murambi, but I cannot make any assertion here that we saw each other and had any discussion whatsoever. 
Q.	So my previous suggestion to you is accurate, that you're testifying on behalf of Mathieu Ngirumpatse based exclusively on your interaction with him in his home between the 7th and the 9th of April? 
A.	And even before that -- before those dates, that is, before the 7th of April. 
Q.	That doesn't seem like a very sound basis to make the statement that you did when you completed your examination by Maître Weyl, that you knew he couldn't have been involved in the killings.  
A.	I can understand your position, but as far as I am concerned, and as I have already stated, the time I spent with Mr. Ngirumpatse from the 7th to the 12th -- and particularly in respect of the fact that he and his wife made it possible for me to help my friend, Frédéric, that alone is enough to convince me that Mr. Ngirumpatse did not have the intent to destroy Tutsis.  It is in that context that I answered yes to Mr. Weyl's question. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  We'll move ahead.  Let's talk about that incident with Frédéric.  Now, several of the witnesses appearing before this Chamber, including Defence witnesses, having already testified that Ngirumpatse's home was consistently guarded by soldiers during the months leading up to April of 1994 -- and that this was well known in your community; do you disagree? 
A.	Are you asking me to confirm their testimonies?  
Q.	I'm suggesting to you that there were other witnesses that have testified, including Defence witnesses, who have stated -- who have given evidence that's contrary to your own, and I'm giving you an opportunity to re-evaluate what you said.  

Witnesses -- several -- both Prosecution and Defence witnesses have testified previously in this trial and have said that it was known in your community that there were always soldiers guarding Ngirumpatse's house.  
A.	As far as I am concerned, I do not refer to any facts that may have been commonly known.  I spoke to what I saw.  Mr. Weyl's questions were very clear and very specific.  He asked me whether -- whenever I went by Mr. Ngirumpatse's house, and I answered, namely, that I had been there three or four times and that on those occasions I did not see any soldiers and I did not see any guards.  So I do not want to correct my recollection of what I remember. 
Q.	But you do seem to be clarifying matters.  Now, your statement is that on the three or four times that you were there you didn't see soldiers? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Well, wasn't it usual or expected back in April of 1994 that the leaders of the MRND party would be guarded by soldiers? 
A.	Well, I'm not in a position to answer that question.  There were not very many leaders of the MRND.  But what I know and what I said is that when Mr. Ngirumpatse was the minister of justice he had guards and he had an escort.  Now, when you ask me if the leaders of the MRND had guards or were guarded, really, I'm not in a position to answer that question. 
Q.	Well, on that point, Édouard Karemera testified in this trial back on the 19th of May 2009.  
	Édouard Karemera, if you don't already know, was the vice-president of the MRND in 1994, and according to him, he had two soldiers that would move around with him and two soldiers that remained at his house.  That is on page 13 of the English transcripts from the 19th of May 2009.  

Is there any reason why Karemera would have soldiers and Ngirumpatse, the president, would not?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President -- Mr. President, isn't this calling for speculation on the part of the witness?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, I'm asking the witness to reason through a proposition that I've made to him.  And if he doesn't think he can give an answer, he can say as much. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, the witness can answer the question. 

THE WITNESS:
Well, there is some measure of speculation in this, but what I saw does not necessarily dovetail with the Prosecutor's position.  But theoretically speaking, and I'm not aware of all the details relating to how guards were assigned to Mr. Karemera, or even less so, the context in which such guards may or may not have been assigned to MRND leaders.  Really, I cannot say much more than that in answer to your question. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  I'll move on.  

There is a witness that testified in this trial, identified as RQU, who gave testimony on the 
6th of April 2009.  Her testimony is at page 41 in the bundle that I circulated in the English text and 
43 in the French text.  And here I'm referring to the handwritten numbers at the lower right-hand corner of the page.  And at bottom of the page, 41 in the English text to page 43 in the French text, she's asked a question.  And this is in regard to the same day that you're talking about, Mr. Witness, the 
early morning of the 7th of April.  

She's asked:  "Ngirumpatse's home was the logical choice for you and other families to make in terms of finding a way to reinforce your security because there was a large contingent of gendarmes who were known to have protected his home; isn't that right?"  And the answer from this witness is:  "Yes, Ngirumpatse's residence was close to a gendarmerie camp and there were indeed gendarmes at that residence.  But I must tell you that during the war it was difficult for me to distinguish between gendarmes and soldiers."  And then it goes on.  

But essentially she's saying -- or she's asked at line 13 on page 42:  "You had seen soldiers at Ngirumpatse's residence before, hadn't you?"  And her response was:  "That most of the residences of figures of authority were guarded.  There were some soldiers at Ngirumpatse's house, and that had been the case for sometime.  So it was not only upon the resumption of the hostilities that that system was put in place."  

So this particular witness, who claims to have been at Ngirumpatse's house in the morning of the 
7th of April and makes reference to some of the same events that you've told us about, is very clear in her answer.  That she went there because she knew that his house was guarded by soldiers and that had been the case for sometime.

Do you think you may have just not noticed that soldiers were usually guarding his house on the days that you would pass his house to go to school?  
A.	No, I do not think so.  Honestly, I do not think so.  Contrary to that testimony, I think that I'm able to distinguish between gendarmes and soldiers.  Whenever we passed by Ngirumpatse's residence, I neither saw any gendarmes nor any soldiers except for the escort assigned to him when he was minister of justice. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  We have your response.

Now, you had arrived at Ngirumpatse's house in the early afternoon on the 7th of April; isn't that so? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	And you were there for several hours before actually leaving with soldiers to rescue Frédéric; is that also the case? 
A.	Well, as I have already testified, I am able to distinguish between gendarmes and soldiers, and so I went with gendarmes, not soldiers. 
Q.	How were you able to distinguish between the two? 
A.	The most obvious is the uniform. 
Q.	Did some soldiers have black berets and others have red berets? 
A.	As far as I can recollect, yes, there were distinctions between the -- or in the military that could be reflected in the berets, black or red.  And as far as I can recall, some of them were even commandos.  But the distinction between soldiers and gendarmes was much clearer because the entire uniform was different for each of those corps. 
Q.	If we limit ourselves to the question of the colour of the berets, who would wear the black berets and who would wear the red berets? 
A.	Well, I no longer recall clearly.  But I cannot tell you who wore which colour of beret. 
Q.	Well, three or four witnesses have testified in this trial on this very incident, and here I'm referring to the 7th of April.  And they all seem to refer to black berets and red berets as a way of distinguishing Presidential Guard from the gendarmes.  Does that sound reasonable to you? 
A.	No.  The Presidential Guard I think had another uniform, so it doesn't appear to be reasonable to me.  As far as I knew, the distinction between the gendarmes and soldiers and the Presidential Guard lay more in their uniforms.  The gendarmes had a uniform that was very, very different from the 
	fatigues or combat uniforms that were worn by the Presidential Guards or the soldiers.  So I think that relying on their uniforms, it is not possible to confuse a gendarme for a soldier. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  Let's get back to the main question that I asked of you.  

You were at Ngirumpatse's house for a few hours before the incident with Frédéric took place; is that accurate? 
A.	Well, I think that we arrived there when the incident had either already taken place or was actually taking place. 
Q.	Were you there when the phone calls came to the house to actually hear at least one half of the conversation on the telephone in regard to Frédéric? 
A.	Yes, I was there when Mugenzi, Justin, called Ngirumpatse's residence, but I did -- was not present and did not hear the telephone conversation.  It is my mother who was present at the time of the 
	telephone call who told me about it. 
Q.	And where was Ngirumpatse?  Was he the one speaking on the phone? 
A.	No, I don't know. 
Q.	Was he there at the time? 
A.	Yes, I think that when we got there he was there. 
Q.	You don't know who was speaking to Mugenzi? 
A.	Thinking about it, I do not remember whether it was Mathieu Ngirumpatse himself or whether it was his wife.  I don't want to speculate.  But as I said, my parents were inside the house and we, the younger children, were outside the house.  The telephone was in the living room.  I don't know who spoke on the phone.  What I know is that we heard about the conversation and I remember the essence of the -- that conversation. 
Q.	Did soldiers -- or did you see -- were you aware of soldiers leaving the Ngirumpatse household -- excuse me, soldiers or gendarmes.  When I say soldiers, I'm just being generic, Mr.  Witness.  Did military personnel leave the Ngirumpatse's household to go over and attend to Frédéric while you were there? 
A.	As I said, I was informed that gendarmes had gone to bring Frédéric to Ngirumpatse's house. 
Q.	Now, in your direct evidence you gave -- you told us about two phone calls, that apparently Frédéric had called Mugenzi twice and Mugenzi had called the Ngirumpatse house twice.  Did the soldiers leave after the first phone call or the second, if you can remember? 
A.	After the first call, the gendarmes left alone.  And then Ngirumpatse's wife went with the gendarmes, and she returned.  And there was a phone call -- whether she was coming back or -- after that.  But there was a second call which confirmed that Frédéric was still there and that he could not get out of his hiding place, if there was no one close to him which would have allowed him to leave his hiding place.  And that's when I left. 
Q.	All right.  I'm trying to understand the chronology though, Mr. Witness, and I'm a bit confused.  

Did -- the first time that the gendarmes went and came back, was Madam Ngirumpatse with them on that first trip that they made to try and find Frédéric? 
A.	No, no.  They were on their own. 
Q.	And when they came back, was there a phone call again after they returned? 
A.	That's why I'm saying I don't remember the exact time of this -- that phone call.  Whether it was immediately after the return of the gendarmes or whether it was after the return of Mrs. Ngirumpatse.  What I remember is that the second phone call confirmed that Frédéric was still there, in spite of the fact that there had been attempts to get him.  So when we received that call, we had the hope that he was still alive because he was still hiding, and that's when I decided to go and get him. 
Q.	Well, what I gather from the documentation and your earlier testimony, is that there was a 
	first phone call.  After that first phone call gendarmes went to look for Frédéric.  They didn't see him and they came back to the house.  

After those gendarmes came back to the house, there was a second phone call saying that Frédéric was still alive.  And that's when Madam Ngirumpatse herself went to see, and then she came back and reported that she didn't see him, and then you went.  

So that's the chronology that seems the most reasonable to me.  You tell me if that's correct or if there's no way of confirming it.  
A.	Yes, I think that is reasonable with the exception of the exact time of the second call, which I'm not sure.  But that chronology seems to me to be reasonable.
Q.	And when the soldiers came back the first time, they didn't say anything about seeing 
	Frédéric's grandfather, did they?  
A.	No, I don't remember. 
Q.	Well, which is it?  They didn't say anything, or you don't remember if they said something about the grandfather? 
A.	I don't remember what they said regarding the grandfather.  They confirmed that everybody was dead and that they did not find Frédéric; whereas, we had told them that Frédéric was still there. 
Q.	And then when Madam Ngirumpatse came back, did she say anything about the grandfather? 
A.	Not specifically.  She too confirmed that everybody had died.  She also said that Frédéric did not answer her calls.  She did not find him.  But I don't remember her saying anything specific about the grandfather. 
Q.	And what was Ngirumpatse -- Mathieu Ngirumpatse doing during this -- or what was his involvement in these specific incidents of the search for Frédéric?  Did he say anything?  Was he doing anything? 
A.	I cannot tell you that specifically.  It's impossible.  What I remember is that I went there.  I was there, but I don't remember the movement in -- of each and every person there, particularly Mr. Ngirumpatse.  I don't remember the movement of each and every person at that time there. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, I was under the impression that your testimony before this Chamber was intended to suggest that Ngirumpatse saved Frédéric, and that's why he's a good person and wouldn't kill Tutsis.  But you haven't told us so far what his role was in the goings and comings of gendarmes to 
	Frédéric's house? 
A.	It's obvious that his role was different from my role and that of his wife.  But we all left from his house.  If he had been against the idea of us going there, we and the gendarmes would not have gone there.  If he had not confirmed that we could leave, his wife would not have left.  In other words, we would not have -- we could not have done everything that we did.  We were at his house.  Therefore, Mr. Ngirumpatse allowed us to do what we did.  And later when Frédéric came there, he was not against the idea of Frédéric remaining at his house.  So your question is a bit surprising as far as I'm concerned. 
Q.	And the gendarmes that went over to Frédéric's house on what seems to be two or three occasions that morning, did they get permission from Ngirumpatse to go over there, from what you could observe? 
A.	I don't know exactly how events unfolded regarding the first gendarmes -- or the gendarmes who accompanied Madam Rose received instructions regarding the -- what I could describe as a life-saving mission.  There were two gendarmes who did not want to go back, but when I insisted, they agreed to come with me.  And I have to say that halfway there they wanted to turn around because there was a volley of gunfire coming from very close.  They wanted to turn around, but I insisted that we had to go on. 
Q.	Now, were these the same gendarmes making these three different trips to Frédéric's house? 
A.	Once again, I can only speculate because I hardly remember the faces of the people who accompanied me there.  We went -- I was with them when we went there and returned, but I don't remember specifically their faces.  So it is possible that they were the same or otherwise, but I cannot really confirm that. 
Q.	Well, I mean it doesn't really require you to recognise their faces.  It's just a question of -- was it the same people that were going back and forth each time?  Whether you could recognise them today or not, were these the same soldiers that made the same -- you know, all three trips to Frédéric's house? 
A.	I'm not talking about recognising them today.  And even at that time I couldn't say who were the 
	first gendarmes or the second group of gendarmes.  That's something I cannot really say. 
Q.	All right.  Did Frédéric ever discuss what happened that morning with you to give you his description of what he lived through? 
A.	You mean later or when they got there?  
Q.	Later.  After -- you know, after you got back to Ngirumpatse's house or after you may have met him again in Belgium, did he give you -- ever give you a detailed account of what transpired that morning? 
A.	When we were in Belgium, we never talked about it.  Personally, I never raised the issue.  

Now, with regard to the time when we returned to Ngirumpatse's house, I asked him questions, as I said in my testimony, where all along the way we were talking about it.  When we got to 
Ngirumpatse's house, we were talking about it.  And probably we talked about it up to when they left on Operation Silverback on the 12th of April.

1000H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  In any case, Frédéric spoke to investigators of this Tribunal on at least two occasions.  I believe there were several occasions, but there are written statements of two of his interviews and I would like us to review those a bit, because he gives me much more information than you were able to give us about this incident and we can find that in the first document in my bundle.  It starts on page 1 for the French text and page 8 for the English text.  And, Mr. Witness, I will hand you up a copy of the French text.  
MR. WEYL:
I will request Mr. Webster to tell us what are those statements, because I have not seen any such statements. 
MR. WEBSTER:
There are two statements that are included in my cross-examination bundle.  The first one is a statement that was made on the 19th of December 1996, and I did hand out some documents yesterday, so that's what I am referring to. 
MR. WEYL:
So, according to you, these are Frédéric Mugwaneza's statements. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Well, in response to Mr. Weyl's question, I didn't take these statements, but I can read and I do see Frédéric's name listed as the witness and I do see the names of the OTP personnel that did take the statement.  So this is a statement that was made to the OTP back on the 19th of December 1996. 
MR. WEYL:
Prosecutor -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, once again we are faced with the same issues which arose on other occasions.  Are these Prosecution witnesses?  Or is the evidence being given by the witnesses?  Or is the evidence being given by members of the Office of the Prosecutor?  We have here documents which are handwritten.  You have the questions and answers written in the same handwriting, and you don't have signatures, except on two -- at two places.  So, Mr. President, we cannot really admit this.  We cannot work like this.  

I would like to add, Mr. President, that if we have a witness, then the witness should be called before this Court so that we can compare what these investigators who signed this statement said, because they want us to believe that this is Mugwameza's statement, but the only way we can confirm is that all these people should be called here for us to confirm this, because this -- these documents have been drawn up by Fred (sic) Paquette and Alain Lépine.  

During our opening statements, Tuesday afternoon, we talked about two remaining witnesses on the Prosecution witness's list where Frédéric Mugwaneza's name is not included.  So here we have something that could have been concocted and you have signatures of investigators only. 
JUDGE KAM:
Counsel, I have a statement by Frédéric Mugwaneza which is handwritten.  I don't know whether you have, but from what I can read, this is Frédéric Mugwaneza's statement, 22nd September 1996. 
MR. WEYL:
Apparently this is his signature, but that's the whole problem, Your Honour.  There is an abuse of process here because this is not Frédéric Mugwaneza's signature, because you have the same handwriting writing down the questions and answers and there is no signature of the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, if you are making an assertion that this is not his signature, do you have evidence to support that?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I have evidence to prove that.  Firstly -- actually, I have three sets of evidence of proof.  Firstly, there are two signatures which -- where it says "signatures of interviewers" on page 2 of our documents.  You have the two signatures where it says "signatures of the interviewers".  The same thing applies to page 1 and page 2, that there is no signature where it says "witness's signature".  

If you now look at page 4 of the other document, which is supposed to be a statement, there is no signature at all.  If you look at page 5, there is no signature at all.  If you look at page 6, there is no signature at all.  If you look at page 7, there are two signatures, which are the same two signatures of the investigators. 

Now, if you look at the other bundle of documents, that is, if you go to page 13 of the following document, once again you will see that there are two signatures of the investigators.  So there is no -- nothing to lead us that the witness had signed this statement.  Therefore, we cannot accept this.  We cannot allow the Prosecutor to pass through documents which do not have any element which can allow us to attribute it to a witness and declare that these documents are actually witness statements, as is normally the case.  And it seems that the Prosecution is doing this systematically. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, Mr. Weyl's argument is misplaced.  First of all, I haven't offered the statement for admission.  If I was offering it as an exhibit, then some of the things that he has to say may be relevant to what the Court has to decide, but I am not offering anything in evidence as I stand before you at this moment.  All I am doing is trying to formulate a question to the witness.  
There is no requirement that I have a signed statement to verify by a witness in order to put questions to this witness.  I would like to continue with my cross-examination.  If we get to a point in his testimony where I am trying to offer this statement into evidence, then we can deal with Mr. Weyl's objections, but that's not what I am doing at this time.  

And even at that point -- I mean, I can continue to argue -- to respond to his legal argument, but it's really not appropriate at this juncture.  He can revisit the issue after I have gone through this information with the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, we have already heard your submission.  I was surprised that the Prosecutor did not say a bit more than he did say because our perusal of the document seems to satisfy us that there is a continuous statement taken by these interviewers with a signature which could be that of Frédéric.  The Prosecutor is correct when he says he has not applied for it to be put in evidence yet.  What's really relevant at this stage is the testimony given by the witness in response to the matters put to him.  But we would need to be satisfied that the Prosecutor does not make an inaccurate statement, does not mislead the witness when he says that the statement was made by Frédéric.  

So if you are going to put to the witness that these are matters contained in a statement made by Frédéric, we need to be satisfied that you are not misleading the witness when you say that.  As I mentioned, our own perusal of the document suggests that that statement could be justified at this stage. 
MR. WEBSTER:
If I may continue, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, on top of what you have said, I would like to say that the Prosecutor at one point in his cross-examination started by saying that he had a written statement given by a witness, and this seems to me that, as it stands, this is not proper and it may lead to misleading this witness here. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Let me try to move forward and I will put everything in its proper context. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have a document in front of you.  I've put it to you as a statement that was recorded from Frédéric Mugwaneza on the 19th of December 1996.  And you've had that in front of you, and I think I have glanced over and observed that you were reading it, so you -- I'm assuming that you've read through a good portion of this written document.  On the face of the document it bears signatures by two investigators.  They report that they spoke to Frédéric at a restaurant in Brussels and this is the information that they recorded based on that conversation.  So with that proviso, let's go through the document and let's see how much what he has to say confirms what you have told us.  

So looking at the first page of text, which is on page 3 on the lower right-hand corner, he starts by saying -- and I've numbered it so you can follow around, number one, and a star next to the paragraph that I am interested in.  He identifies the soldiers that killed his family as "PG" and describes them as wearing black berets and that they were accompanied by soldiers wearing red berets.  Now, do you recall the soldiers that were with you when you went back to Frédéric?  Were any of them wearing black berets or red berets?  You can just focus on my question, Mr. Witness.  
A.	This is what I am trying to do.  You are asking me whether I remember which branch of the military wore black berets or red berets.  Is that the question?  
Q.	No.  My question to you is:  The soldiers -- or, the gendarmes that you went with over to 
	Frédéric's house, were they wearing black berets or red berets? 
A.	I went there with gendarmes.  The gendarmes were wearing different uniform from those worn by soldiers, and they were wearing uniforms which were different from those worn by members of the Presidential Guard.  I don't have the image of the berets the gendarmes were wearing, but our gendarmes wore only red berets.  It's only in the army that one could see the various types of berets. 
Q.	In any case, we continue through the document where I have indicated paragraph number 2.  Frédéric reports or reported to these investigators that he had seen some of these soldiers before because they had come to his house to search it, and that they had done that because they had seen his father leaving the CND after some sort of meeting.  So Frédéric is starting to bring out some sort of pattern to the soldiers coming to his house. 

Then if we go down to paragraph 3, Frédéric talks about two calls to Mugenzi.  But after the first phone call, his grandfather was still alive, and what he told Mugenzi was that he needed help thinking that Mugenzi was his friend and that Mugenzi would send help for him and his grandfather and the domestic servants that had survived the killing of a few minutes earlier. 

And then when we continue in the document, Frédéric says that the soldiers came back.  That they didn't come back to help; they came back to finish the job.  He was hiding in the roof.  His grandfather and the domestic servants were outside, and those soldiers didn't help them.  They killed the survivors.  

And then the next thing that Frédéric recounts is when you came and called him.  And you've told us that he was hesitant.  He didn't want to come out because he had seen what soldiers had done in his house before.  And it was only because he recognised you and trusted you that he finally came out. 

Now, reflecting back on that morning, in light of the information that's coming through this statement, doesn't it seem to you that the soldiers -- or, the gendarmes you saw leaving Ngirumpatse's house didn't go to save Frédéric; they went back to finish the job that they had started earlier that morning?  
A.	No, not at all.  That doesn't seem to be coherent. 
Q.	Give us your explanation of why not.  
A.	Because if this document has been admitted, I know I can rely on it.  Frédéric is talking about soldiers, not about gendarmes.  But, as I told you, you could tell the difference between gendarmes and soldiers very easily.  That is my first comment. 

My second comment is that, if you look at this document, the time between the two events is quite long, so much so that those people who had committed the massacres could have come in between those two events.  That's possible. 

When the gendarmes -- the first group of gendarmes went there -- if my recollection is correct, there were four gendarmes.  When they went there, they confirmed that everybody had died.  So you can make inference which you wish to do so out of that.  

Another point is that the first gendarmes were sent long after the time which Frédéric is talking about in respect of the coming of the soldiers there in order to finish up their dirty job.  So it seems that what you are saying is not consistent with what I experienced. 
Q.	Well, how much time passed between the two telephone calls that came to the 
	Ngirumpatse's residence that morning, if you can remember? 
A.	Earlier on I was saying that I was not very -- I am not sure about the exact time they arrived.  But from my recollection, the second phone call occurred when -- either just before Mrs. Ngirumpatse went out or before I went out. 
Q.	I'm not asking you when the calls came.  I am asking how much time elapsed between the first phone call and the second phone call.  
A.	Yes, there is a link.  It's difficult to say, but it's about -- it was about -- let's say about ten minutes.  But it's difficult to actually give the exact length of that interval.  You can only deduce it on the basis of what I have said and my statements, as well as the statement which you have given me, but I cannot give you the time frame with certainty. 
Q.	According to Frédéric, he got Mugenzi's telephone number from his grandfather, which would indicate that his grandfather was still alive when he was speaking to Mugenzi the first time, because it was the grandfather that gave him the number to call.  Right?  

If we can rely on this recorded statement, that makes sense, doesn't it? 
A.	So why doesn't it make sense?  
Q.	Well, Madam Ngirumpatse returned to that house a few minutes later after the gendarmes came back, right? 
A.	I can't really say, but it could have been about ten minutes.  Mrs. Ngirumpatse returned after the first expedition carried out by the gendarmes. 
Q.	And she reported that everybody had been killed.  
A.	Yes, exactly, just like the gendarmes had announced, those who had left before. 
Q.	So the killing of the grandfather took place some time between the first phone call, the return of those gendarmes to Ngirumpatse's house empty handed and then Madam Ngirumpatse's visit to that house.  She couldn't have been, by your estimation, more than 15 minutes or so.  You said there were 
	10 minutes between the two phone calls and 10 minutes between the phone call and Madam Ngirumpatse's visit to that house.  Right? 
A.	No, no, that's not correct.  I did not give any specific timing in terms of the minutes.  I said about 10 minutes, so I -- I'm not sure that I mentioned specific time frames.  

However, what you say, which is correct, is that Frédéric's grandfather died after the first telephone call and clearly before the first set of gendarmes went to that location, because upon their return these gendarmes confirmed that all persons had been killed. 
Q.	Well, all persons had been killed because they are the ones that killed them.  They went looking for Frédéric and they found his grandfather and killed his grandfather, came back, and then Madam Ngirumpatse went.  And by the time she got there, everybody was dead.  Doesn't that seem what the -- isn't that a reasonable explanation based on what you know today? 
A.	Well, that is a theory.  It's -- which flows from the sequence of events.  But if you were to bear in mind what I have just told you, then I don't believe in that theory.  I have explained the three points which to my mind lead me to believe that it was not the first time the gendarmes went that the grandfather and the other members of the staff at Mugwaneza's were killed.  So if you were to take all of that into account, then what your theory holds is not plausible -- is no longer plausible. 
Q.	Anyway, thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  I'm not going to stay with this too much longer, but I would like us to look at another document.  This is the second document in my bundle.  It's a record of a conversation between Frédéric Mugwaneza and investigators of the Tribunal recorded on the 
	11th of April 2000.  

Let me hand up a copy to you in French, Mr. Witness.  It begins at page 13 in my bundle.  There is an English translation at page 15.  

This statement does not bear a signature from Frédéric Mugwaneza.  It's an investigator's note.  It's part of a confirmation mission to confirm the contents of his previous statement and to anticipate his testimony in a trial that was going to take place.  And have a look at what Frédéric has to say.  I've underlined and made notations of the most important passages.  It's just a half-page long.
And in the statement he says when he got to Ngirumpatse's house that morning he saw Ngirumpatse.  The name "Ngirumpatse" is left out of the translation on page 15, but it clearly appears in the original French document.  And other men that he didn't recognise.  And that he realised -- and I will read it:  

"I later understood" -- excuse me.  He says, "I stayed with other children, but I noticed that the soldiers who were outside and wore red and black berets kept going back and forth.  I later understood that they were going out to kill the neighbouring families and came back to Ngirumpatse's to take further orders.  Mr. Ngirumpatse went in and out of the house alone.  The soldiers at the gate were practically the same ones who came to my house.  Moreover, some of them recognised me when I arrived."  

So if we can rely on this record of Frédéric's conversation with OTP investigators back in the year 2000, he definitely seems to be interpreting the facts a little bit differently than you are.  Would you like to respond to that suggestion? 
A.	Yes.  Now, is it possible to see the original manuscript of this document?  
Q.	I believe you have in your hands whatever original there is.  The document you have consists of two pages.  The first page signed by the investigators is the text entirely in French.  It's, in fact, signed twice at the top and at the bottom.  The second page is a standard form, a reconfirmation form that we only have in its original.  It doesn't require a translation -- excuse me, it's an English document that was attached to the original French document.  It's a standard OTP form of a witness reconfirmation in anticipation -- or, as part of an investigation, all referring to the same conversation with Frédéric. 

If you dispute the contents of the document, I have no problem with that, but just respond to my suggestion based on what this document is disclosing to us.  
A.	First of all, let me note that this document appears to be containing a statement or testimony which does not relate to the same time frame in my testimony.  I talked about the events relating to Frédéric when they went to fetch him, but Frédéric is referring to other events here which I did not experience. 

Now, I also, as you have understood, have some doubts, to my mind, as to the original nature of this document.  I would really be interested in seeing the original of this document, whether it bears Frédéric's handwriting.  You see, the document was produced four years after the first document.  So now -- four years after.  So I am really very confused as to the exact nature of this document.  I, therefore, do not know whether a reaction or a response to this document would be in order. 
Q.	Well, back on the 7th of April you thought that Mugenzi was Frédéric's friend, or at least 
	Frédéric's father's friend, right, back on the 7th of April 1994?  
A.	Yes, yes, indeed. 
Q.	And Frédéric must have thought the same thing, because he asked -- he took the initiative of contacting Mugenzi expecting Mugenzi to send help.  That's a logical deduction, right, that Frédéric thought Mugenzi was his friend? 
A.	Yes.  A family friend. 
Q.	Yet according to this documentation from Frédéric, when he saw Mugenzi again at Hôtel des Diplomates a few days later, Mugenzi appeared shock to see him and didn't even speak to him.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President -- Mr. President, you asked the Prosecutor to be specific in his questions.  Now, whether we are having an interpretation problem, which I hope is not, or there might be some lack of clarity, now, we heard the Prosecutor say that "relying on documents from Frédéric".  I would like to know whether the Prosecutor has any document from Frédéric. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Perhaps it is an issue of translation, not that the translation was incorrect, but perhaps you have misunderstood -- counsel has misunderstood.  I said documentation concerning Frédéric, not necessarily signed by Frédéric.  And you had referred us all to page 7, which is the French text, paragraph 5 in the first document I circulated, where the information recorded from Frédéric -- where he talks about running into Mugenzi at the Hôtel des Diplomates. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I don't see the link, but let me point to the clock once again, and if the Prosecutor has other questions along this line of questioning, maybe we could pick them up -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)...take the adjournment.  It's now 10:30 and we will take our mid-morning recess now.
(Court recessed from 1034 to 1100H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster, you can continue.
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  Mr. Witness, I only have a few more questions on this issue and then we'll move forward.  We left off talking about Justin Mugenzi.  Did you see Justin Mugenzi in the Ngirumpatse home on the 7th of April? 
A.	No. 
Q.	So, as far as you know, the only contact he had with the Ngirumpatse home was the telephone calls that you became aware of? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you know if Mathieu Ngirumpatse spoke directly to Justin Mugenzi for either one of those two phone calls? 
A.	No.  As I said a short while ago, I am not certain about that. 
Q.	But Mathieu Ngirumpatse was present for the entire sweep of events concerning Frédéric, from the 
	first phone call alerting him -- or, alerting you to the problem until Frédéric actually arrived at the Ngirumpatse household, is that so? 
A.	Yes, I think so. 
Q.	Did you see Mugenzi when you got to the Hôtel des Diplomates a few days later? 
A.	Yes, I saw him. 
Q.	Did you speak to him? 
A.	No.  I don't think he knew me. 
Q.	Did you overhear any conversation with anyone that would indicate to you that Mugenzi was aware of your role in saving Frédéric? 
A.	And that I would have overheard, is that what you said?  
Q.	I'm asking you if you overheard any conversation or had any information back in 1994 when you were at the Hôtel des Diplomates, which was either the 9th or the 10th of April, that would lead you to conclude that Mugenzi knew about your role in saving Frédéric.  
A.	No.  I did not overhear any conversation that would have stuck to my mind. 
Q.	Do you agree that it would have been appropriate or it would be appropriate for Mugenzi to enquire about Frédéric or to speak to him if he saw him in light of what his role in trying to help him? 
A.	Yes, probably. 
Q.	But if we can rely on Frédéric's statement to the investigators, or the record of his conversation with the investigators, Frédéric reports that Mugenzi was shocked to see him and didn't say anything to him.  
A.	And what is your question?  
Q.	What do you make of that? 
A.	I am surprised, surprised, because, first of all, I don't have the exact statement made by Frédéric or what he intended to say, so I can only rely on your own interpretation.  But as I think through the issues, I am surprised because Mugenzi must have been aware that Frédéric had been saved and that he had spent three days at Mr. Ngirumpatse's house.  Therefore, I do not understand what surprise would have been expressed when he saw him at the Hôtel des Diplomates. 
Q.	And what about the information that we have from Frédéric that Mugenzi didn't even speak to him or greet him, what do you make of that? 
A.	Same thing.  As you would have understood, I am a little suspicious as to the veracity of the transcripts and the statements that you are referring to.  And this is not in evidence.  And if I had the original manuscript, I would have been able to recognise Frédéric's handwriting, so that further increases the level of my doubt.  So what is written here is not plausible.  It is contradictory, particularly in respect of the fact that Frédéric had pass -- had spent some time at Ngirumpatse's house and Mugenzi would have known that he had been saved and was under the protection of Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  We'll move on. 
Now, when you were being transported from Ngirumpatse's house to the Hôtel des Diplomates you had to cross a good deal of the city of Kigali, isn't that so? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Did you notice roadblocks erected throughout the city of Kigali when you made that trip from Ngirumpatse's house in Kicukiro to the Hôtel des Diplomates in the plateau in Kiyovu? 
A.	Not many.  There were not many.  And we were driving extremely fast late in the afternoon.  It was raining.  There were not too many people on the road.  I do not recall any stop or any roadblock between the departure and arrival at Hôtel des Diplomates. 
Q.	A few roadblocks or you don't recall any roadblocks?  Because you started off by telling us you saw a few and then you ended saying that you didn't see any.  Which is it? 
A.	Well, two things:  Seeing them and having been stopped at them, those are two different things.  So the roadblocks may have been there and opened or simply abandoned.  So what I am saying is that we were not stopped and we did not stopped -- or, we were not blocked at any roadblock throughout that trip.  And we drove extremely fast.  There was a military vehicle at the head of the convoy, and we sped through the city right to the Hôtel des Diplomates. 

Now, whether I saw roadblocks or not, let me think through it.  I believe that I saw a number of roadblocks, but we were not stopped at any of them.  We did not stop at any of those roadblocks. 
Q.	The ones that you saw, were they manned by civilians or soldiers or both? 
A.	Now, as I have just told you, the roadblocks -- the roadblocks that were along that way, from Mathieu Ngirumpatse's house to Hôtel des Diplomates, I no longer recall exactly.  But I cannot be more specific, much more than I have been in terms of the roadblock at which we were almost killed.  So the point is that I cannot answer your question specifically. 
Q.	Did you see any dead bodies along the way, on the roads or at the roadblocks? 
A.	No.  That evening, no.  On that trip, no, I didn't see any. 
Q.	On the 12th of April when you were leaving Kigali in a convoy from the Hôtel des Diplomates to Murambi, did you see roadblocks for that trip? 
A.	Yes.  Many of them. 
Q.	And were they manned by civilians or soldiers or both? 
A.	My impression -- given that I cannot speak about the specific situation of each roadblock, my impression, therefore, is that the roadblocks were manned by civilians. 
Q.	Did you see bodies at any of the roadblocks?  Dead bodies.  
A.	Yes.  Not only near the roadblocks, but even between roadblocks along the roadside, and sometimes even on the road itself.  Indeed, this must be one of the most terrifying pictures on my mind.  As we left the central roundabout up to Nyabugogo, there were so many dead bodies strewn along the road. 
Q.	Is there anything that you were able to discern about the ethnicity of the corpses?  Did you get the impression that these were Tutsi predominantly or not, back on the 12th of April? 
A.	Now, you have put two questions to me:  Whether I was able to discern or notice and whether they were, in fact, Tutsis.  Those are two questions.  You see, it was not possible for me to distinguish anything at that time.  It was entirely impossible to do so.  

However, later on I did learn that most of those who were killed at the roadblocks were Tutsis.  I, therefore, could come to the conclusion that the dead bodies I saw were those of Tutsis. 
Q.	And among the dead bodies, did you notice women and children? 
A.	I don't have a clear picture, but I think -- yes, yes, I think so. 
Q.	With respect to the women, were you able to discern if they had been sexually assaulted?  In other words, was there any indicia from the condition of the corpses that those women had been sexually assaulted? 
A.	No.  My answer clearly will be no. 
Q.	When you got to Gitarama -- or, actually, when you crossed the Nyabarongo river, would you agree that the situation of roadblocks was remarkably different? 
A.	After crossing the Nyabarongo river?  What is your question?  I did not quite understand it.  
Q.	My suggestion to you is that when you got to Gitarama there were no roadblocks, or the roadblocks were significantly different from those you would see in Kigali.  And I am asking you to agree with that or disagree.  
A.	Yes, I can confirm that.  Once in Gitarama -- I do not even recall whether we came across a roadblock on that evening when we arrived in Gitarama, but the roadblocks we saw the next day were clearly different from those we saw when we were leaving Kigali, particularly in terms of the dead bodies that were strewn all over the place. 
Q.	When you say "the next day", could you clarify for us, please?  I'm not sure if I understood you.  Are you talking about the next day, the 13th, in Gitarama?  Explain what you've said.  
A.	Yes, from the 13th and subsequent days. 
Q.	So, in other words, when you and the convoy arrived in Gitarama on the 12th there were no roadblocks and no killings, right? 
A.	No.  Roadblocks were -- there might have been one or two roadblocks but which did not in any manner whatsoever look like those in Kigali.  When we arrived in Gitarama, I did not notice the same prevailing atmosphere of killings and massacres which we had left behind in Kigali. 
Q.	But then the next day after you arrived in the convoy, the situation began to look like it did in Kigali, is that your testimony? 
A.	No, that is not what I have told you. 
Q.	Well, explain what you've told me, because that's what I understood from your earlier statement.  
A.	When we arrived, there must have been one or two roadblocks.  And I must say that I am speculating on this point because we didn't drive through the whole city.  We got to Murambi and went to my grandparents' home, so we did not notice roadblocks and I did not notice this atmosphere of killings.  The next day things were very much the same, because the atmosphere continued to be more serene and more peaceful, and this lasted a number of days. 

What I said yesterday is that we moved on from each town as the security situation deteriorated.  So when we got to Gitarama, things were still more or less normal.  There was not so much insecurity.  People could move about on foot.  I even went to meet some friends and to play basketball with them in Gitarama.  

You see, for us Gitarama was a place where the war had not yet broken out, and so we felt that maybe some day we could return to Kigali.  But there was no impression that some day there would be as much insecurity in Gitarama as there had been in Kigali. 
Q.	So when was it that things took a turn for the worse in Gitarama? 
A.	It is a little difficult to put an exact date to it, but I think that from early May -- I would say from early May we understood that returning to Kigali was out of the question, and my parents were already considering fleeing to Europe, so from early May.  I personally went to Gisenyi on a number of occasions in an attempt to go to Goma towards Kinshasa in order to leave.  So I travelled to and fro.  And whenever I returned -- and this didn't happen too often.  It happened on a number of occasions.  I noticed that there was increased insecurity.  We saw roadblocks spring up.  We saw people with a number of weapons.  And then we also noticed that there were a number of dead bodies.  There was an increase in the number of roadblocks.  And the civilians who were manning those roadblocks were increasingly more threatening, and it is within that context that we noticed these types of things.  So in late April, early May there was increased insecurity in Gitarama. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I see the time ticking.  I have around 15 minutes to go and I'll be completed.  I hope that we'll be within the framework of time that's allotted to me. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I suspect that if you need 15 minutes more you may have to apply for an extension of time. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I would like to do that now.  I just have one last series of questions, and I should finish before 
	15 minutes, but let me request from the Court 15 minutes to complete. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, if the simple need for time is sufficient grounds for exceeding the time set forth, then there is no need for the rules to assign time frames.  And on these grounds, therefore, I think the Prosecutor has to demonstrate that there are other grounds on which he needs more time, not simply say that he needs time.  It is an application to say that "I want time", but you need to substantiate that application, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, first of all, there are guidelines that the Court has issued, but I don't recall them being rules in the sense of Rules of Procedure.  And my request for time is really to go into some additional matters that are relevant because they concern evidence that was adduced by other witnesses that are germane to the issues that this Chamber will have to decide.  All of the evidence must be weighed as a whole, and this witness clearly has more to offer than the matters that Mr. Weyl examined him on.  What I have to ask is relevant.  It continues from Mr. Weyl's cross-examination, but it also touches on other evidentiary aspects that I think are deserving of some exposition.  And I think I can do that within 10 to 15 minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, we have decided among ourselves that the -- for the basis for granting you the 15 minutes you requested, but we are serious about the time management of the trial.  And we don't think that you should assume that additional time will be granted every time you ask for it. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I understand, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We are serious in maintaining the time standards we have set out. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you recognise the term or the name Cyakabiri? 
A.	Mucyakabiri.  Is that what you are saying, Mucyakabiri?  
Q.	I may be mispronouncing.  What I understand is the correct pronunciation is Cyakabiri.  Does that mean anything to you? 
A.	Well, I need some more guidance. 
Q.	I understand that there is a location right outside Murambi on the main road from Kigali where there was a roadblock, the most significant roadblock at the entrance to the side street going into Murambi which was referred to as Cyakabiri.  Does that sound right to you? 
A.	Yes, yes.  That area or that location is called Mucyakabiri. 
Q.	And that's where you were stopped with your brother? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you give us an approximate time period when that event occurred, the one you talked about in your direct examination? 
A.	Between the 15th of April and the 15th of May, I would say. 
Q.	So you can't make it any more narrower than a month.  Sometime during that month is when you were stopped at that roadblock? 
A.	No, I could not be more specific.  You see, there are some events that relate to a very specific date which one can recall plus, minus a day, but for that one -- 
Q.	You would agree that anyone going to Murambi -- the ministers that were headquartered there, for example -- would notice that roadblock because it was right at the intersection of the main road and the side road that takes you into Murambi, right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you would agree with me that it doesn't reflect well on the government officials that were headquartered in Murambi to have a roadblock manned by such undisciplined soldiers? 
A.	Is that question cast in general terms, or is it relating to that specific roadblock?  
Q.	Let me move on.  You stayed at your grandparents' home in Gitarama.  But while you remained at home, WCL, and number three on the list that I gave you before -- I can ask Mr. Issa to give it to you again, which is identified as P. 518.  If you could place that before the witness, please.  I believe it's number 1 and number 3 on that list -- went to Murambi every day while you remained at home, isn't that so? 
A.	Yes.  They went there practically on a daily basis, yes.
(Pages 13 to 26 by Joe Reynosa)






















1130H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And that was because number 3 was the ****************************************************; right? 
A.	I did not know that capacity ************************.  I was not aware of it. 
Q.	Let me circulate another document to you.  It's -- give me one second.  
A.	Now, to help us move forward, I know and I can tell you the capacity in which he was known. 
Q.	Go ahead and do that.  
A.	Yes.  That person was the ********************************************************************** 
MR. WEBSTER: 
If we can all look at page 39 in my bundle.

And if Mr. Issa could hand this up to the witness. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	You don't necessarily have to read the contents of that yet.  Just look at the handwriting.  Do you recognise the handwriting on that document and the signature at the bottom? 
A.	I do not recognise the handwriting, but I recognise the signature. 
Q.	And is that the signature of number 3? 
A.	Yes.  It closely -- very closely resembles number 3's signature. 
Q.	Okay.  Well, it's a document, a witness statement, that is purported to be the witness statement of number 3, signed by her on the 18th of December 1996, with a handwritten statement which may or may not be her writing in terms of the content of the statement itself.  But as you seem to acknowledge, that's her signature at the bottom.  

If we look where I have made a star of the middle of the page, number 3 seems to be describing herself as the *************************************************************************************************.  But perhaps she **********************, as you have clarified for us. 
Q.	One ******************************* *******************************************************************************, particularly the reporting from foreign journalists, particularly the English-speaking journalists; isn't that so? 
A.	Yes.  That is correct. 
Q.	And did she ever explain to you the contents of those ************************************ for *********************************? 
A.	No.  No. 
Q.	(By order of the Court, this portion was extracted and kept under separate cover) isn't that so? 
A.	Yes.  That is correct. 
Q.	And when WCL applied for asylum in Belgium, his applications were denied repeatedly for that very reason; right? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And the information that we have is that as late as May 2008 he was still -- 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Excuse me.  Mr. President, could I speak?  

The Prosecutor has just given the pseudonym of a witness and -- but mentioned the -- that person's official duties as well as the time when he was in that post.  So he has just revealed the identity of that witness.  

So don't you think that since this was -- the -- the Prosecutor has already revealed that witness's identity.  So I respectfully request the Trial Chamber to order that appropriate measures be taken in order to protect that witness's identity. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I apologise.  I -- I thought I was going to be able to address these issues without going into closed session.  But perhaps the best thing for us to do is simply to go into closed session for five minutes, and I will complete my examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
In addition to that, we have to make an order for -- for redacting the relevant material. 

Yeah.  For the benefit of the public, it's apparent that information which ought to be protected is going to be discussed over the next two or three minutes.  So we have to go into a closed session for that period.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 29 to 32] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 27 to 28 by Tanya West) 













MR. PRESIDENT: 
You now have to respond to counsel for Mathieu Ngirumpatse who may have questions to put to you in redirect examination. 
RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness -- 
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I have some very short questions for you following your answers given to the Prosecution.  I would like to ask you questions on three points.  The first thing I would like to request you -- is to ask you to clarify certain matters.  

When the first phone call was made by Mr. Mugenzi to Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse's house, were there already gendarmes present there?  
A.	You mean present in front of Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse's house?  
Q.	Present at the house or in front of the house or behind the house.  It's up to you to give us clarification in respect of the manner in which they intervened, because you told the Prosecutor -- or, rather, the Court during cross-examination how they left the house to go to where they went after the phone call.  
A.	From what I was told -- because I did not see how everything unfolded.  But from what I was told, the parents -- I don't know which, our or their parents -- went to see the gendarmes and requested the gendarmes to go and get Frédéric.  The gendarmes were on the other side of the road about 5 metres away.  So they went to see them and requested them to intervene. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Second point on which I would like to have your comments regards the fact that to one of the Prosecutor's questions you answered that in 1994 Hutus were killed -- or, rather, Tutsis were killed -- no -- Hutus were killed because they were pro-RPF.  But to your knowledge, were there any Hutus killed because they were against the RPF? 
A.	Yes.  I can give you the examples which I mentioned yesterday, Corneille's family, and there are other cases as well.  I don't remember the names right now.  But if I -- given time to think, I'll remember them. 
Q.	What about in your immediate circle, in your family, for example, in the general population?  Weren't there any Hutus killed in 1994 when in -- in the wake of the RPF advance? 
A.	In my immediate circle I don't have any names which I can think of, but it's true that there are families who told us about very heavy losses.  I'm talking about Hutu families who lost many people in the wake of the RPF advance. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Now, I'll move on to my last question.  

The Prosecutor asked you to confirm whether you had not heard any statement made by Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse as from the 6th of April 1994.  Do you confirm that?  
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	So you're confirming that during that period you did not hear any statement made by Mathieu Ngirumpatse inciting people to hatred or to extermination of Tutsis? 
A.	Yes.  I reconfirm that. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. WEYL: 
I have no further questions for this witness.  But I do have an application to make to the Trial Chamber on behalf -- I'm tired.  I can't even pronounce the name.

Mr. Witness, I'm sorry I have problems with your name.

But the application is that this witness would like to meet Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  So I'm requesting the Trial Chamber to allow him to meet Mr. Ngirumpatse and taking into the account the fact that we have only this afternoon for him to be able to do that.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

	Now, Mr. Witness, your testimony before the Tribunal is completed now.  And we thank you for assisting us with our work, as we do all witnesses who testify before us.  So you are now excused and you are free to leave.  

We will request the registrar to make arrangements for your request to be granted. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
(Witness excused)
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I assume that the next witness is going to be called right away.  But while we do that, I would like to request one of the documents be marked for identification.  It's document B in my bundle, which is the reconfirmation statement for Frédéric.  It may become relevant at a later point in the trial.  And I'd like it to be a part of the record just for purposes of identification at this stage. 
MR. WEYL: 
Can the Prosecutor be more specific in designating or specifying which document he is talking about. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes.  It's pages 13 to 15 in my cross-examination bundle.  It's the reconfirmation statement of the 11th of April 2000.  And clearly, it's not in evidence.  It's simply identified for the record. 

MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, to limit for that purpose the portion covering -- from page 13 to 15 in view of identification, would lead us to object.  If there had been -- if there had not been other difficulties, maybe -- or, rather, there are difficulties.  So I think that maybe in -- in this respect I might have to request the Trial Chamber to go into closed session. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
In relation to marking a document for identification?  It's not been admitted into evidence at this stage. 
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President.  But it does cause a problem because it's not a document which brings any new information from the point of view of the integrity of the trial, even for the purpose of identification.  They just want to pick a small portion of this document when this document tells a whole story.  So this is the problem.  What I can tell -- I can -- I can explain why in a closed session.  And it will be -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  You -- you want the Prosecutor to put everything in?  Your request is that the -- the whole story be put in?  Because the -- the issue will not become an issue unless there's an application to move it into evidence.  And at that stage we will then have to discuss the issues that you are raising.  

Right now all that is -- all that is being done is that we are identifying the document that he used during his cross-examination.  It has no other status or purpose for our record unless or until a further order is made.  If he makes such a -- an application, then the issues will become more relevant for us to make a decision.  Right -- right now this is a -- just a purely administrative matter.  
MR. WEYL: 
Very well, Mr. President.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will mark the document for identification purposes only. 
MR. MJUI: 
The document will be PID. 63, six-three.  Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.
(Exhibit No. IP. 63 marked for identification, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is -- is the next witness being brought in?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. -- 

MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, the chairs have switched, and here I am. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Ms. Hounkpatin.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
The next witness is LAB.  At the beginning of his testimony, we will be applying for a waiver of his protective measures.  And yesterday we had sent out an email containing the acronyms of our witnesses who would like to see the protective measures waived, and LAB is one of them. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you for that. 
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, Mr. Witness -- good afternoon.  I think it's just past -- it's just midday, so good afternoon. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Your -- we understand that you've expressed a wish that the protective order that the Court made in your favour, the effect of which will be to prevent your identity from being revealed to the public -- we understand that you wish us to rescind that order so that you can testify publicly and that your identity will become publicly known.  Is that the position?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So you now wish to testify openly in your own name?  
THE WITNESS:
Very well. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We rescind the protective order made in favour of this witness.  

Mr. Registrar, could you adjust the screens so he can be revealed to the public.  

Before you begin your testimony, you have to take an oath to tell the truth and the registrar will now assist you to do that.
MR. MJUI:
Witness, kindly stand up.  Raise your right hand.  Repeat the following words after me:  I solemnly declare that I will speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. MJUI:
Thank you.  You may sit down. 
JUDGE KAM:
Mr. Witness, the Bench notices that your oath was not complete. 
THE WITNESS:
I'm very sorry.  I could repeat the oath, the solemn declaration.  
JUDGE KAM:
	(No interpretation)
THE WITNESS:
	Yes.  I will do so -- gladly do so.
MR. MJUI:
Kindly stand up.  Raise your right hand.  Repeat the following words after me:  I solemnly declare that I'll speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation) 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. Issa could make things easier by pausing between the clauses so that the witness may not be overwhelmed by emotion or may not forget some bits and pieces of the solemn declaration.
(Declaration made by Cyprien Ngendahimana in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Okay.  Mr. Witness, you will give your testimony by responding to questions put to you by counsel representing Mathieu Ngirumpatse, who will begin her cross-examination now -- sorry -- her examination-in-chief. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I noticed that everybody is in a hurry today.  Mr. Witness appeared to be like Obama and the judge who bungled the solemn oath somewhat.  

But again, let us return to our own business here.  And I will try to proceed slowly so that we can all calm down.




CYPRIEN NGENDAHIMANA,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:  
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	And now, Mr. Witness, I would like to tell you that you and I are speaking the same language.  And so we need to slow down and observe a pause between my question and your answer.  This will facilitate the work of the interpreters and the court reporters.  Do you understand that, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Yes, I understand that. 
Q.	Thank you.  A document has been placed before you bearing your particulars.  I would like us to look through that document together.  Your name, date of birth, place of birth, names of parents.  Your name is Bengahimana (sic), Cyprien.  And, please, I'll ask you to look through that document quickly.  And if there are any mistakes that need to be corrected, please point them out.  Otherwise, I would ask you to date the document and sign it, and then I would move to produce the document into evidence thereafter.  

Are you done, Mr. Witness?  
A.	Yes, I am done.  The information in the document is correct. 
Q.	Please date and sign the document.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. Issa can collect that document.  And I would -- believe that this would be Exhibit D.  NG88 -- 98.  While Mr. Issa is collecting the document, I would like to spell out the name of the witness, N-G-E-N-D-A-H-I-M-A-N-A, for the record.  Ndengahimana (sic).  Ngendahimana, rather.  I'm sorry.  I mixed up the G and the D.  
MR. MJUI: 
Your Honour, I would like to confirm that the exhibit number is D. NG98, nine-eight.  Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NG98 admitted) 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Witness, what is your native commune in Rwanda? 
A.	I am a native of Rushashi commune in Rwanda. 
Q.	Please tell the Court about your educational background.  

In that connection allow me to mention that whenever you state a word or you use a word in Kinyarwanda, please kindly spell it out for the record.  You mentioned Rushashi a short while ago.  Please spell that out.  
A.	R-U-S-H-A-S-H-I. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could you also indicate what préfecture that was in. 
THE WITNESS:
Kigali-rural préfecture. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Do you remember the question I put to you, Witness, or should I repeat it? 
A.	I remember the question.  You were asking about my educational background. 
Q.	Please proceed.  
A.	I attended primary school in my native secteur.  Then I went to secondary school at the Gahini school of arts.  And I obtained a diploma in arts or letters.  After my secondary education I was employed, and it was while working that I became trained as a journalist.  I worked with an information and press service.  

But apart from that I was also trained in the area of teaching and education. 
Q.	Could you be more specific as to the year in which you obtained a diploma in letters or arts.
A.	It was in 1987. 
Q.	When did you start work?  When did you start working? 
A.	I have already stated that I was lucky enough to start working immediately after my secondary education, that is, in 1987. 
Q.	In 1987 when you started working, what was your position and who was your employer? 
A.	I was employed by the government at ORINFOR, O-R-I-N-F-O-R, the Rwandan information board or office.  Initially, I was employed as a broadcast antenna coordinator.  That is the position I had initially.  Then I served subsequently as a sports journalist and then went on to be in charge of sport -- sports programme at the national radio. 
Q.	Please tell the Court the date on which you became a sports journalist and also tell us the date on which you were appointed head of the sports section at ORINFOR.  
A.	In 1989 I was no longer a radio broadcast controller, and it was in 1990 that I became a sports journalist.  And in '92 I became head of the sports service at the national radio. 
Q.	Where were you on the 1st of October 1990?  Were you in Rwanda, or were you out of the country? 
A.	In October I was in Rwanda. 
Q.	What happened at that time, and what did you notice or observe as a journalist? 
A.	What I can remember is that on the 1st of October the country went into war against armed persons from Uganda. 
Q.	Did you monitor or follow the situation yourself as a journalist, or did you simply learn of it as a Rwandan citizen? 
A.	I have said that this is information that I became aware of as a Rwandan citizen. 
Q.	What were the consequences of that declaration of war that you noticed or observed? 
A.	With the declaration of war, the first thing that one would say is that there was an element of surprise because this was not part of our Rwandan culture.  We saw people fleeing their native areas to move towards areas that appeared to be more or less calm. 
Q.	Are you saying that from the 1st of October 1990 people were moving about or being displaced already? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Now, can you tell the Court, as far as you know, from which part of the country people moved and where they moved to.  
A.	Initially, it was from those areas bordering Uganda and to the north, particularly in Byumba préfecture.  Then the fighting spread to Ruhengeri préfecture.  And in those areas people started to move towards the centre.  Some even went as far as the capital. 
Q.	Please tell the Court who the population were fleeing, who was the attacker or aggressor.  Was he identified? 
A.	The aggressor or attacker was identified as the rebel movement known as the RPF.  The RPF was said to be a group of armed rebels belonging to the RPF (sic). 
Q.	That aggressor, where did he come from geographically speaking? 
A.	Geographically speaking, the aggressor came from Uganda. 
Q.	(Microphone not activated)...Excusez-moi.  Did you notice from that date -- or did you observe security developments from that date within the population? 
A.	As the rebellion developed, the country became panic-stricken.  People who were fled -- fleeing spread the dirt to the rest of the country, and people were scared and still yet -- yet hoping that the national army would be able to stop the -- the -- the advance of the rebels. 
Q.	Could you remind or tell this Trial Chamber what the political regime in Rwanda was at that time.  
A.	At the time of the attacks, there was only a one-party system in place.  One could say there was only one political party in place, and it was the MRND.  
Q.	MRND.  When you say MRND, who are you -- or what does that acronym stand for? 
A.	Well, if memory serves me properly, M stood for movement, R was for Rwanda and N for national and D for development -- the national revolutionary movement for development. 
Q.	Very well.  We will take it as that.  You have properly situated the word "revolutionary" where it ought to be, not Rwanda.  

Were you able to notice any political changes or developments at the same time during that period?  And I'm going to be a little more specific.  That is between the end of 1990 and 1991.  During that time did you notice any political developments in the country?  And if yes, could you describe those developments as you observed them.  
A.	As far as I can remember, before the war, that is, before 1990, there was a one-party system in place and in power.  But then there came a time where multiparty politics was introduced. 
Q.	As far as you can remember, can you tell the Court how multiparty politics was introduced.  
A.	Well, I am not an expert in politics.  But let me simply tell the assembly that I was not interested in politics.  I was interested in sports.  I was a sports journalist, and that was my area of interest.  

What I can say, therefore, would simply be an ordinary citizen's take, not the opinion of a 
political analyst. 
Q.	Please proceed briefly.  
A.	Would you kindly repeat your question, please, Counsel.
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
I have --

	Mr. President, maybe for this microphone we need to have some kind of a solution.  One thinks that it is on, and then it is off.  I don't know how to deal with this.  

However, what I will say is that it is 12:30, and maybe this is a good time for the break.  And we could proceed with the next questions after the break, as the Court pleases.  Maybe this is a good time to break. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, Ms. Hounkpatin has just said that there is, in fact, a technical problem with this microphone.  Maybe during the -- the break the technical services can -- can look at the microphone, because it seems to have a problem.  Because when you think it is switched on, it is actually off.  So there is actually a technical problem with this particular microphone. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Is it time for the break, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, it is. 

Mr. Witness, we are going to take our luncheon agreement now -- luncheon adjournment now.  And I should let you know that during this or any adjournment while you are a witness you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
We take our luncheon adjournment now.
MR. KOUAMBO-TCHINDA:
All rise.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  All -- all -- Mr. Registrar, although I'm sure it's not really necessary to do so, I'll invite you just to make sure that the microphone problem is solved.  Not necessary in the sense that I know you do that automatically in any event.  
(Court recessed at 1230H) 
(Pages 33 to 42 by Tanya West)




























(Court resumed at 1411H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon.  

Mr. Witness, your examination will continue.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:  
Good afternoon, everybody.  

Good afternoon, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:  
Good afternoon, Counsel.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	We left at the end of the morning session with your answer telling the Court that your interest was focused on sports and not politics, but that as a citizen you nonetheless followed political -- the 
	political development of the country; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct, madam. 
Q.	Do you then -- or, rather, confirm to the Chamber if, as you explained, several political parties appeared on the political scene in 1991.  
A.	Yes.  That is correct, Counsel. 
Q.	Personally, did you join any political party at that time, and if yes, which one and if no, why not? 
A.	I did not join any political party that -- because, as I explained to you, I was not very interested in politics. 
Q.	All the same, did you follow the rallies of political parties and speeches that were made on those occasions? 
A.	I followed that in the press without paying much attention. 
Q.	During the multiparty era, are you able to tell the Court what the security situation was like during the political discussions? 
A.	What I do recall is that multiparty system came at a time that the country was already at war.  So I will say that the multiparty movement came at a time that the country was going through war -- was going through a war. 
Q.	A while ago you gave me an answer in relation to the speeches that you listened to.  I would like you now to focus your attention on the MRND, the republican movement which was born out of the multiparty system.  Did you follow the speeches that were made by political leaders of that party? 
A.	As I said earlier, I heard them but I did not really pay attention to them so I'm not able to say that I heard this or that.  I have no recollection of what was said during those meetings. 
Q.	Very well.  Did you know Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Yes, I knew him. 
Q.	Are you able to explain to the Chamber under what circumstances you knew him? 
A.	First I knew him as a native of my own native region.  And then when I used to go out to school, everybody -- everyone had a dream and my dream was to become like Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	Just a moment, Witness.  Take it slowly so that the interpreter is able to interpret you. 
A.	Thank you.  So I was saying that I knew him from the beginning because he -- he hails from my 
	native region.  And in my native region he was known as somebody who is educated, so that urged me to acquire education.  I also know him as somebody who had given a lot of -- a lot of himself to the state, particularly in the area -- in the judiciary. 

Further, I knew him as a staunch Christian, somebody who was a leader -- who was a choir leader in the church.  I also recall that he was the choir leader of the -- of Kigali.  Even though he was a very important personality he still found time to share with other members of the community and be able to lead the people as he should. 

So I cannot say that I knew him, that man, but he is somebody I have known for a long time.  I even had the opportunity to stay with him, so I will say that I know -- I knew him. 
Q.	You said you stayed with him in the house, in which house, and during what period?  Can you explain that. 
A.	I stayed with him after the war when we were in the Republic of Congo. 
Q.	And what -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
Your Honour, if the witness can pause between the question and answer.  We tend to miss the beginning of his answers. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, I think the interpreters are not following you.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
It's just the beginning.  He doesn't pause between counsel's question and answer. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Let me re-put my question so that we will get the sequence right.  I asked you, first of all, to indicate when you lived with him in the same house.  Answer that one.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can the witness pause?  We missed the beginning of his answer.  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation) 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
(No interpretation)

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
Yes, madam, because the witness comes in just when you finish your question.  We missed the beginning.  Before we finish interpreting you he is already answering. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:  
Q.	Witness, you need to pause at the end of my question before you start answering.  Don't answer immediately after me. 

Pause briefly.  Maybe not up to a minute, just a pause after my question.  
A.	Very well, madam. 
Q.	So my question was this:  Tell the Court at what time did you live together in the same house.  
A.	That was during the period after the war when we were in Congo, DRC. 
Q.	And what were you able to observe about the character of Mr. Ngirumpatse at that time? 
A.	What I managed to observe was that, first of all, Ngirumpatse is a staunch Christian.  First -- his 
	first priority was prayers.  He was somebody who could meet anybody from the entire spectrum of the class category and I saw in him as somebody whose life and personality was above board. 
Q.	Above board?  
A.	Irreproachable. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did you visit his restaurant, the Eden Garden? 
A.	Yes, I had been there on several occasions. 
Q.	And are you able to tell the Court where that restaurant was located and what you were able to observe by going there? 
A.	The club was located close to the house that was known as Karemera's residence.  It was close to the plateau, city centre, close to the neighbourhood that was called Matheus at the time.  I don't know if it is still called Matheus today. 

Now, regarding what I observed when I -- whenever I went there.  First of all, even though that club is known to be for Mr. -- Mr. Ngirumpatse, it was his wife who managed the place.  She is the one that I saw there quite often.  And then I realised that it was a place where everybody, irrespective of his or -- political background, could come and have a discussion while having a drink. 

And I recall that there were several persons from all ethnic groups, be they Hutu, Tutsi, or Twa.  That is my recollection. 
Q.	Thank you.  You also made reference to his choir.  What do you know about the choir?  What was the composition of the choir?  
A.	Same as the composition of people who were -- who used to come to the club.  The choir was made up of people from all ethnic groups of Rwanda.  I can remember as many Hutus as Tutsis.  So it was a choir that represented the entire ethnic spectrum of Rwanda. 
Q.	Do you know written -- any written work -- I mean musical work written by Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	I believe I have seen many.  But today I remember a song that was very popular.  I believe it was composed by Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  And that song was entitled Umushumba ushagawa.  Umushumba ushagawa.  I can spell that.  It is spelt U-M-U-S-H-U-M-B-A.  Umushumba.  
	Ushagawa is U-S-H-A-G-A-W-A.  Ushagawa.  
Q.	It is true that we both speak French.  But we both do not understand Kinyarwanda, so are you able to translate what that means to the Chamber. 
A.	If I should attempt a translation I will say that it means a pastor surrounded by his faithfuls. 
Q.	And who was that pastor in this context? 
A.	If memory serves me well I think it was the bishop of Nyundo. 
Q.	What was particular about the Nyundo bishop? 
A.	The Nyundo bishop was a Tutsi, if my memory serves me right. 
Q.	Witness, now let's move on to the events you went through from the 6th of April 1994.  Are you able to tell the Chamber where you were on the 6th of April and what you did? 
A.	On the 6th of April, as usual, I went to my work place, which at the time was the national radio station.  During the morning session I did office work and in the afternoon I had to do a live coverage of a football match.  It was an international football match and, if I recall correctly, it was a cup of 
	African nations match. 

This was around 1800 hours and I covered this with my team.  I went with a driver and a technician who was to ensure the technical support.  After the match -- the coverage was done on the 
Horizon Channel -- and after the match, we had a coffee break.  We went to a bar where we had -- I had some water.  When I say "we" I mean myself, my technician and of course the driver who was ferrying us around. 

And, if I recollect correctly, around 2030 hours while we were taking -- we were having our drink, we heard an explosion.  And since that was -- had become like a common practice, one could hear explosions any time.  So it was a daily occurrence in the capital, so we just said to ourselves that "Well, yet another explosion." 

We continued having our drink. 
Q.	I'm sorry, Witness, I have a question for you on the explosion.  If I understood you correctly, you are telling the Chamber that explosions were common? 
A.	Yes.  In the capital it was common.  It was a common occurrence. 
Q.	And that, therefore, you continued having your coffee without paying any particular attention. 
A.	At the time I heard the explosion we -- it captured our attention.  Even though it was a daily occurrence, that did not mean that it did not capture our attention.  So in fact that limited the time that we spent at the bar.  And we decided to continue on our way so that we can, first of all, take the technician home, and then myself, and then the car had go back to ORINFOR, because it was not my private car, it was an official vehicle which took radio -- staff of the radio station to and from work. 
Q.	Now, are you able to describe to the Chamber the progression? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
Your Honour, we just can't interpret this witness because he comes in before we finish interpreting counsel. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, I have heard Counsel Hounkpatin ask you on several occasions to observe a bit of a pause after she has finished asking her questions, before you start to answer them, to allow the interpreters to finish translating what she has said.  They are having difficulty in translating the beginning of your answer because you have not been following the directions you've been given.  They have just raised the issue with me once more and so now I have to draw it formally to your attention and I ask you to pay some attention to observe it. 
THE WITNESS:
I've heard you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Now do you recall the question that she -- her last question?  Do you recall 
	counsel's last question?  Because you have to begin your answer again. 
THE WITNESS:
Very well. 

So if I should go over -- or the question was for me to describe the day of 6th of April.  And I stated that I went to my workplace, as usual. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	No, Witness, don't go over -- don't take it right from the beginning.  My last question to you was as follows:  After the explosion, you took off to go to the house of each one of you, and I'm asking you to describe the process to the house of each one of you.  So after the coffee break, the explosion.  Now the progression to your respective houses. 

Wait for the translation to be completed. 
A.	So I said that we took off to go home, beginning with the technician.  And the technician lived behind the airport, so when we took the road leading to his house, close to the Kanombe airport, the soldiers stopped us.  I tried to explain to them that we were taking the technician home and that it was night and that he couldn't go on foot.  So I asked them to allow us to take him home, which they refused.  They told me that there is no problem, he will get there, but "You have to turn around and you cannot go further."  Which is what we did. 
We, therefore, left the technician with the soldiers and then we turned around to go towards my house in Gisozi. 
Q.	Witness, if I understood you correctly, this was a roadblock. 
A.	Yes, it was a military roadblock.  Yes, madam.  It was a military roadblock.  So I left the technician there.  I went on -- that is, the driver went on to Gisozi when we got there -- or, rather, when we got to Remera.
Q.	Mr. Witness, that roadblock, were you seeing that roadblock for the very first time or was it a roadblock which had been there? 
A.	I was seeing it for the very first time, because normally we would pass by there and drop off the technician at his house. 
Q.	So from what you've just said that roadblock was manned by soldiers near the airport.  
A.	Yes, it was manned by soldiers.  So I was saying that we continued towards Gisozi.  When we got to Remera, near Hotel Amahoro, we came across another military roadblock.  It was at that military roadblock where we were informed of what had happened.  They stopped us and showed us fires in the direction of the airport, and they told us it seems that it's the president's aeroplane burning.  So they advised us to go on our way but with cautious -- cautiously.  And we did that, we went on our way.  

	And when we got to Kimihurura, we were stopped again and we spent a few minutes there.  I remember that one of the soldiers who was there confirmed to me that the president's aeroplane had been shot down and that they were not sure whether there were survivors in the wreckage. 

After hearing that news when -- when I was with my driver, I remember that my driver panicked -- or, myself too, I panicked -- and he could not start the car.  And the soldiers who were at that roadblock pushed the car and, by some miracle, the car started -- the engine started and we went on our way. 

We continued with our trip.  We were told to use the normal road; they advised us not to use shortcuts or bypasses.  That is what we did.  We passed by the gendarmerie and took the road leading to my home.  And that was around nine, or quarter past nine p.m. and we got to my home. 
Q.	Did you feel any agitation or was the situation calm in town, at least when you were on that road going home?  
A.	Apart from the military roadblocks which I talked about, there was no other movement on the part of the population.  So the situation was normal. 
Q.	Hold on, please.  Let me finish my question, and observe a short pause before answering. 

So what was your driver supposed to do after dropping you off at your house? 
A.	After dropping us off, the driver was to return to the radio station so that he could take home the other staff members, because he -- that driver was supposed to drop off to their homes people who were on duty. 
Q.	So if I understand you -- let me rephrase my question. 

Was the -- the usual driver -- or are there -- were there several drivers or was he on duty on that day?  
A.	There were several drivers.  He was not my personal driver.  The car was for the sport's section and the driver, therefore, had to drop us -- drive us.  He was the driver on duty. 
Q.	At what time did you receive official confirmation in respect of the attacks against the president's aeroplane? 
A.	The official confirmation I heard at around 6 o'clock in the morning.  However, I would say that in the evening, or at night, at around 9:30 or 9:45 p.m., RTLM radio station had announced it.

1445H 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Did you remain at home that night? 
A.	That night, we slept as usual, but my family and I were afraid.  
Q.	You've just said that at around six, or around 6:30 a.m., you heard the news on the radio.  So what did you do that morning -- that is, on the 7th of April, and what did you do during the day? 
A.	On the 7th of April, we woke up hearing intense bombardment, and when we went out, I -- we were living in Gisozi.  Gisozi is an area which is next to the CND where there were RPF units based.  So we heard gunshots.  At the same time we also saw movement of soldiers of the RPF who were coming out of the CND.  

First, I went to see whether I was going to be picked up to go to work, but -- but I was not surprised when they didn't come to pick me up because after the official announcement -- after that, there was official announcement ordering each and every person to stay at home.  

In our area it was almost impossible to go out -- it was impossible to remain indoors because we heard gunshots, and therefore, people went outside their homes to see what was happening outside when they heard the gunshots.  

So at around 9 o'clock in the morning, I decided to go to work in order to see what was happening.  When I went out of my house, a few metres away I came across a roadblock, and, at the same time -- well, let me say that at the entrance to the city -- the capital city -- there were refugees who were at the Nyacyonga area.  So when they heard the gunshots, they started going towards the city centre.  

So when they -- when I got to that roadblock, since it was a makeshift roadblock, I stopped there and was able to see what was happening at that roadblock.  After that, I went on my way and got to my work.  
Q.	Where -- where was your workplace? 
A.	It was in an area called the plateau.  
Q.	Could you please repeat your answer.  
A.	I was working in an area called le plateau.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, between your neighbourhood to the plateau, after the first roadblock which you mentioned, did you encounter any other difficulties before you got to your workplace? 
A.	Yes.  I remember that I came across another roadblock at Kinamba; however, that roadblock was being manned by gendarmes.  But there were also some civilians there.  
Q.	Could you tell the Court what kind of control or checks were there at that roadblock.  
A.	At the roadblocks, since there were people passing through, particularly refugees who had been at Nyacyonga, the people manning the roadblocks would ask them to show their identity cards.  
Q.	And what would happen after people showed their identity cards or otherwise? 
A.	When you showed your identity card -- when you showed your identity card, they would allow you to -- to go through.  If you did not have an ID, then you would not be allowed to pass through a roadblock.  
Q.	Did you see what happened to people who did not show their identity cards and who were, therefore, stopped there?  What was their fate?  And here, I'm referring specifically to the 7th.  
A.	At that time I showed my identity card, they allowed me to get through, so I don't know what happened to the other people.  But I think that such people would be taken to the competent authorities.  
Q.	You described your trip to the office located on the plateau.  For how long were you at your -- at your work?  When did you leave your workplace? 
A.	I left my workplace at around 3 o'clock in the afternoon.  
Q.	Did you go through the same roadblocks on your way back? 
A.	Yes.  I went through them and I noticed that the number of roadblocks was increasing.  
Q.	Their number was increasing.  This means that -- okay.  Let me ask you, how many roadblocks did you go through between the plateau to your home? 
A.	When I was going back home, there was a roadblock near the bridge.  There was another roadblock at Kinamba.  So I can say that there was one more roadblock.  Another thing is that the number of people at the roadblocks also had increased.  
Q.	The control carried out at the roadblocks -- the control, was -- was it the same? 
A.	Now, concerning the 7th of April, the control and checking was the same on both occasions.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you said that the checking consisted of asking people to show their identity cards.  You also said that people who did not show their identity documents would not be allowed to pass.  
So would you say that at that time the people manning the roadblock were simply carrying out 
checks, or they were sorting out people belonging to a specific ethnic group -- at the roadblocks? 
A.	I thought that, actually, they were carrying out checks, particularly since it was known that when you had such movement of people, then you could have people from the RPF who would take advantage of the situation in order to infiltrate their members in areas which they had not yet occupied.  
Q.	Now, according to your description, people who did not show their identity documents would be considered as suspects? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	So did you get home?  
A.	At what time?  
Q.	I'm still talking about the 7th of April.  
A.	On the 7th of April, since there was no movement of vehicles, I left my workplace at around 3 o'clock in the afternoon and I got home at around 5 p.m. 
Q.	I'm wondering about something.  You said there were more people who were at the roadblocks.  
Did you notice whether the people at the roadblocks were armed? 
A.	Yes, they were armed.  
Q.	What kind of weapons did they have? 
A.	At the military roadblock the soldiers had firearms, and at roadblocks where you had civilians, the civilians had traditional weapons.  
Q.	Did you go out on the 7th of April?  If not, can you tell me what happened on the 8th.  Did you go to work on the 8th? 
A.	On -- once again, on the 8th of April, I tried to go to work and I went through the same routine as on the previous day.  
Q.	So on the 8th of April, you went through the same roadblock with the same atmosphere of control and checks -- that is, people had to show their roadblock -- their identity card in order to go through? 
A.	Yes, the checking system remained the same.  People were asked to show their identity cards, and anyone who did not show his or her identity card would be stopped.  
Q.	To the best of your recollection, could you tell us who were the people at that roadblock in terms of what kind of people were there.  Did you see all sorts of people there or otherwise? 
A.	Yes.  There were all sorts of people at the roadblocks, with the exception of women and children; otherwise, you could find young people, old people -- sometimes even children.  
Q.	(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please.  
MS. HOUNKAPATIN:
Excusez-moi.
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Did you notice whether, amongst the people who were there, there were members of all ethnic groups, that is, at those roadblocks? 
A.	I remember that, at that time, there were people from all ethnic groups because they were looking for people who did not have identity cards.  
Q.	By asking you that question, I -- I also have a follow-up question:  So there were -- when -- when you say that there were people from all ethnic groups at the roadblocks, what do you mean? 
A.	You see, the roadblocks had been mounted spontaneously, so all the inhabitants of a given area were at the roadblock, be they Hutus, Twas or Tutsis.  They had to come together at those roadblocks.  
Q.	So if I understand your explanation, there were people from -- their -- neighbourhood (sic).  And, if that is the case, did you recognise any of your neighbours at -- at the roadblock which was near your home? 
A.	Yes, that was the case, ma'am.  
Q.	In your neighbourhood, you had neighbours who were Hutus, Tutsis and Twas, right? 
A.	Yes, that was the case, ma'am. 
Q.	On the 7th and on the 8th, you went to the plateau, that is, the Kigali city centre.  Now, tell us what happened on the 9th of April.
A.	On the 9th of April, the situation changed, particularly in the area where I lived.  Very early in the morning I was at the roadblock, just like the other inhabitants of that area.  Then there was a -- there was gunfire from -- coming from various areas, so I ran away in order to save my life, and we tried to run towards an area which was calm.  I remember that I must have run -- or walked for 4 or 5 kilometres to an area where -- which was far from where the shots were coming from.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  So you're saying that you got to the roadblock in the morning.  Can you tell us what was your area, that is, the area you lived in. 
A.	I was living in Gisozi.  Gisozi is an area which is about 7 to 8 kilometres from the plateau.  
Q.	But why did you go to that roadblock in the morning of the 9th of April? 
A.	Actually, I was not going to the roadblock.  I had spent the night with other people.  So in the morning -- we heard the gunfire in the morning.  
Q.	At around what time in the morning? 
A.	Between five and six in the morning.  
Q.	So what did you see at the same time? 
A.	The -- there was gunfire, people panicked, particularly the refugees who were on the outskirts of the city, that is, at Nyacyonga, and everybody was trying to save his or her life.  
Q.	Please tell me if I'm mistaken.  There was gunfire; you were at the roadblock; there was an influx of refugees and everybody was running away from the roadblock, so there -- there was no one manning the roadblock in the end? 
A.	No one with their traditional weapon remained because the gunfire was intense.  I remember that the people who were with me went to a place which was more or less safe.  
Q.	So when you got to that place, what information did you get? 
A.	When we got to that place, we saw a movement of regular troops going towards the area which we had left.  So when we saw that movement of the regular troops, we said that it's now a matter of time before they mop up the area, which had been endangered, and that we hoped that subsequently we could go back home.  
Q.	Were you able to go back home, and was the regular army able to mop up the place? 
A.	Unfortunately, that was not the case.  Our dream of going home was shattered.  Around -- between 1500 hours and 1600 hours, when we saw the movement of the troops coming back, in the beginning they went with four armoured vehicles, but on their way back, they came back with two armoured vehicles.  And they confirmed to us that the -- that area had been taken over by the enemy, that they were not able to carry out the mop-up operation and that, consequently, we should find a place to stay.  
Q.	What then did you do? 
A.	At that time there was nothing else to do, apart from fleeing and getting a place to lay one's head.  
My family joined me at that place and together with other inhabitants of the neighbourhood we continued all the way to the Sainte Famille church.  
Q.	Around what time did you get there? 
MR. SENDZE:
Sorry to interrupt, but I keep hearing "That place.  We went to that place".  Could you please give a name for the place.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Yes, dear colleague.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Yes, Witness, are you able to clarify for the Chamber and the parties where you stayed as a refugee pending -- pending the mop up in your residential area?  That place was not named.  
A.	So when we were chased out of our houses, we assembled in this area called Kinamba.  And it is there that the troops informed us that we could no longer go home because they were not able to contain or repulse the RPF troops who were occupying that place.  
Q.	And what is the distance between Kinamba and your neighbourhood Gisovu (sic)? 
A.	About 4 kilometres.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you ask him to spell -- 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Yeah.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, are you able to spell all those words, Gisovu (sic), Kinamba.  
A.	Gisozi is spelt G-I-S-O-Z-I.  Gisozi.  Kinamba, K-I-N-A-M-B-A.  Kinamba.  
Q.	And please repeat this place that you took refuge together with the other families.  
A.	We took refuge at the Sainte Famille parish.  
Q.	My last question before this clarification was to know that when you arrived at the Sainte Famille parish, what measures did you take? 
A.	This was at sundown.  So between 1800 hours and 1700 hours -- because even though we were told that we could not go back home, we still had hopes that things could change.  So we got there around 1800 hours.  
Q.	And did you spend the night at the Sainte Famille parish? 
A.	Yes, that is where we spent the night.  
Q.	And what did you do the following day, the 10th of April? 
A.	The 10th April, early in the morning, we were observing what was happening in the hope that 
at one -- at some point in time we're going to be able to go back, but unfortunately, we, rather, saw combat between the gendarmerie, that is, the gendarmerie camp located opposite the Sainte Famille parish.  Faced with that, we lost our hopes of going back home.  We decided to continue our way towards Gitarama.  
Q.	Why did you decide at that point in time to go to Gitarama? 
A.	I decided to go to Gitarama, first -- first of all, because it was a safe area; secondly, because we had a local office there that could assist me.

1515H 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Are you able to explain very concisely how you got to Gitarama when you left from the 
	Sainte Famille parish? 
A.	First of all, we walked all the way to Nyabarongo.  

Nyabarongo, for those of you who want to know how it is written, it is N-Y-A-B-A-R-O-N-G-O, Nyabarongo.  

But before we got to Nyabarongo we had to go through roadblocks, some of them manned by soldiers and others manned by civilians.  I recall a roadblock at Muhima, another one at Giticyinyoni.  Giticyinyoni is G-I-T-I-C-Y-I-N-Y-O-N-I, Giticyinyoni.  

So it was at Nyabarongo that we were able to get a means of transportation to take us to Gitarama in town.  
Q.	At what time did you arrive at Gitarama? 
A.	We got there around 3:30 p.m. 
Q.	Along the way Nyabarongo-Gitarama, did you have to go through roadblocks? 
A.	The only roadblock was at Nyabarongo, but all the way to Gitarama there were no roadblocks. 
Q.	Once you got to Gitarama, what did you do?  Were you welcome by relatives, friends?  What happened? 
A.	When we got to Gitarama, I introduced myself to the regional office, and it was the officer in charge there who gave me clothes, because I left Kigali with, I will say, bedroom -- my bathrobe.  So it was very cold.  So it was in Gitarama that my colleague was able to give me clothes.  
Q.	Did you get any accommodation? 
A.	At the beginning, I expected to be accommodated by my colleague, but that did not happen because my colleague also hails from the Byumba region where there were a lot of displaced persons, so his house was full.  When we realised that his house was full, we requested my colleague to help us to go to a secondary school which was there.  It was -- the school was called Byimana.  That is 
	B-Y-I-M-N-A (sic).  So I lodged at Byimana with my family. 
Q.	You got to Gitarama on the 10th.  What was the security situation at Gitarama? 
A.	On the 10th Gitarama as calm. 
Q.	Did you witness the coming of the interim government?  
A.	No, I did not witness that, because during that period I was struggling to find a place to lodge and start a new life rather than spending my life in a public place, which was the school.  So I did not witness the coming of the new -- of the interim government. 

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Are you able to tell the Chamber if at one point in time you were able to stabilise things, start your work with ORINFOR located in Gitarama? 
A.	Yes.  Even as I was still destabilised, I referred my problems to the Gitarama office.  And even though I was not at home, I was still an employee of ORINFOR.  So I had to present myself there to see if there was anything I could do.  So I was able to go to the regional office.  
Q.	At what point in time did you actually start working in that office -- I mean what date?  
A.	I will not recall the date.  All I remember is that it took me a bit of time to settle in at the new place.  But it must have been after five or seven days following my arrival in Gitarama.  
Q.	One week later then? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What did you do? 
A.	What did I do?  I said that I shared my duties with my colleagues who were in the region.  In actual fact, the work -- the nature of the work had changed.  One did not know what to do.  Since the government was located in Gitarama, one could go there and see if we could meet our leaders who can give us some direction as to what to do. 
Q.	To go over your explanations, you were no longer a sports journalist; you were covering events? 
A.	That is so.  Since we were in a war situation, there was no longer any interest in sporting news, particularly since the programmes of the -- of the radio station had changed significantly.  Sports programme were no longer on the -- on -- were no longer on air.  So, as I explained, I had to get close to my bosses so they can assign me any duty that they wished to assign me. 
Q.	Was there any time that you wanted to go to Ethiopia -- you wanted to go to Addis Ababa in Ethiopia? 
A.	No, I did not go to Addis Ababa.  I recall that when they wanted a journalist to accompany the 
	Rwandan delegation going to Addis Ababa, this was in Gitarama, it so happened that they suggested that I go along, and then finally they realised that that was not my area.  Luckily, they found Mr. Bamwanga, who was a news journalist who went to Addis Ababa. 
Q.	Can you spell Bamwanga? 
A.	Bamwanga is B-A-M-W-A-N-G-A. 
Q.	Thank you.  Please describe for the Chamber, after you settled relatively in Gitarama, the climate that you observed.  Was there insecurity, or in the one week or ten days that followed your arrival in Gitarama did the situation stabilise? 
A.	I will say that the week that followed my arrival in Gitarama was relatively calm, but people were concerned about the massive movement of people who came to settle there. 
Q.	Would that mean that there was insecurity, or was it the massive movement of people into Gitarama that was destabilising people? 
A.	I would say that it was the massive movement of people who were not used to Gitarama. 
Q.	At that time did you observe any killings in Gitarama? 
A.	At least along the routes that I took, I did not see any killings. 
Q.	Describe then for the Chamber the climate that you observed around the government officials who came to settle in Gitarama, if you had opportunity to meet them at that time.  
A.	Yes.  I managed to get to Gitarama and to observe from a distance what was happening at the government level.  But what I can say regarding the climate, the environment, is that one realised that that -- it was a government that was overwhelmed by events, a government that lacked logistics.  They -- the human beings went there and left the logistics and equipment in Kigali.  It was a government headed by somebody who had never been a minister.  So one realised that the government was overwhelmed, so it was disorder.  
Q.	I overlooked a question a while ago.  In the ORINFOR staff, the team that made up the Gitarama office, are you able to say if all the ethnic groups were represented? 
A.	Yes, all the ethnic groups were represented.  Even this colleague who welcomed me, who moved around with me is a Tutsi.  
Q.	So during that period, there was a disorderly environment, as you said a while ago? 
A.	Yes, that was so. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I see it's 1529 hours.  And my next line of questioning will not take two minutes.  I therefore suggest, if you'll agree with me, that we adjourn now and come back on Monday. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel originally said tomorrow.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
So we come back on Monday.  And I have barely 30 minutes more of questions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it's time to take our adjournment now.  

Mr. Witness, as I mentioned to you already, during this or any adjournment while you are a witness you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  It's a long weekend because we don't resume until Monday, but you have to observe this requirement to protect the integrity of your testimony.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  I understand, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, earlier this week you had raised the issue of planning for the rest of the case.  We think it's early to do that.  We think we should wait until next week until we see how the pattern of the session evolves, and then we'll be in a better position to make our planning for the rest of the case.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, with regard to the written decision you promised us two days ago, do you have anything to advise regarding our application for certification to appeal?  I know that you talked about it two days ago, but the only new element is that I've made official my application for certification to appeal.  So I was wondering about the way forward or what the situation is.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Diagne, my advice to you is patience, patience, patience.  I'm sure that before the end of the day everything will be clear.  We, in fact, have approved the final version, and it's in the process of being filed now.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
So we need that much patience.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  So we take the adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1533H)
