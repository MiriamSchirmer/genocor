P R O C E E D I N G S 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.  

The Trial Chamber would like to apologise for coming late.  It had a matter to -- to finalise which touches on these proceedings.  

So, we will commence these proceedings with an oral ruling relating to Prosecution Witnesses CNAA and CNAC.  And this is the ruling.  

On 23rd November 2009, the Defence filed a second motion seeking the disclosure of Gacaca and judicial material relating to Prosecution Witnesses CNAA and CNAC.  On the 1st day of December 2009, the Prosecution filed its response to the motion.  

As a preliminary issue, the Trial Chamber notes that the present oral ruling is limited to the disclosure matters and to postponement of testimonies of Prosecution Witnesses CNAA and CNAC.  The Trial Chamber recalls that it has already addressed issues of late disclosure with respect to Witnesses CNAA and CNAC in its decisions of 29th October and 13th November 2009, respectively.  

In these decisions the Trial Chamber took notice of the late disclosure with respect to these two witnesses, and granted alternative remedies by directing the Prosecution to make the necessary adjustments to its order of appearance.  In particular, the Trial Chamber recalls that at the commencement of the trial, as an alternative and appropriate remedy, the Trial Chamber allowed the Prosecution to reschedule the testimony of Witness CNAA from the first week to the last week of this trial session.  In its decision of 13th November 2009, the Trial Chamber then ordered the Prosecution to postpone the testimony of Witness CNAC, thus providing the Defence with sufficient time to properly prepare its cross-examination.  

The Trial Chamber observes that the Defence does not raise any new facts in its motion warranting further postponement.  

The Trial Chamber notes with concern that the matters currently raised in this motion have already been adjudicated, and the Defence has established no basis for relitigating these matters.  The Trial Chamber therefore wishes to express its disapproval of the Defence's conduct in seeking to relitigate matters that have already been adjudicated.  It accordingly finds that such conduct may amount to an obstruction of proceedings.  

For the foregoing reasons, the Trial Chamber denies the Defence motion in its entirety, warns the Defence in accordance with Rule 46(A) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence to desist from conduct which obstructs the expeditious conduct of the proceedings, and it holds that other matters raised in this -- in the instant motion will be addressed in a subsequent reasoned -- written reasoned decision to follow in due course.  

That is the ruling of the Trial Chamber.  

Could the registry now arrange to bring in the next -- the witness who is on the stand.  

Perhaps as the witness is brought in, Prosecution, we would like to know what the status of your witnesses is.  Is Witness CNAE well?  
MS. MAPOSA:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  We are happy to inform the Chamber that CNAE is feeling well today and is able to take the witness stand this morning.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecution.  

Good morning, Witness.  Can you hear the Trial Chamber?  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President.  I can hear you very well.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, the Trial Chamber would like to remind you about the oath you took to tell the truth, and that you will continue to testify bearing that oath in mind.  

Prosecution, we are in open session.  
MR. MAWERE:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  There will actually be no re-examination from the Prosecution.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecution.  

Well, Witness, there will be no more questions for you this morning.  The Trial Chamber would like to thank you for making the decision to come and enlighten the Chamber on the events of 1994 in your area.  It will have an opportunity to consider your evidence, alongside all the evidence that will be adduced in this trial, at the end.  Thank you, and you may now leave.  
Registry, could you kindly draw the curtains for the witness to leave.  
(Witness excused)
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Just if I may, briefly, before we wait for the next witness.  First, for the motion for which we were sanctioned this morning, I want you to just be aware that our reply to the Prosecution, for which we had up to today to file, was filed before we got the warning.  So I would like this reply to be understood as falling under the umbrella of that warning as well.  That is the first matter.  

And, second, I need to fly to Kigali tonight for reasons which you all know.  And because my -- the latest flight was around 7, I would kindly ask the Court to break maybe at the afternoon break to allow me to run and catch that flight, because I'm alone here and the lead counsel has gone to Paris.  So I would kindly request that the agenda today allows me to leave at the afternoon break.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, when you say "afternoon break", which break are you talking about?  The 4 o'clock one?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Yes, the 4 o'clock break.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  To allow for Defence counsel adequate time to make his travel arrangements, the proceedings today will end at 4 o'clock this afternoon.  

Registry, could we have the next witness, please.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MS. MAPOSA:
Madam President, Your Honours -- Madam President, Your Honours, I am realising that maybe the wrong witness has been brought.  I was expecting Witness CNAE, CNAE.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Who is the witness on the stand?  
MS. MAPOSA:
It's CNBA, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is CNAE within the court precinct?  
MS. MAPOSA:
Yes, yes, in the wings, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Since we are not -- how long do you reckon your examination-in-chief will be?  We are just wondering whether this witness should not be taken back to the safe house today.  
MS. MAPOSA:
Yeah.  I understand we are going to proceed with the cross-examination of Witness CNAE, Your Honours, today, after examination-in-chief.  I stand to be corrected.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we should.  But how long do you reckon you'll take in your examination-in-chief?  Because that might impinge on the time taken in cross-examination?  We just want to gauge whether this witness should be brought back at any time today or not.
(Witness exited courtroom)
MS. MAPOSA:
Madam President, Your Honours, since we are breaking at 4 today, I would suggest that if this witness can be taken back to the safe house.  In examination-in-chief I may take around one-and-a-half to two hours.  But now, on cross-examination, I wouldn't know how long my learned friend would take.  I suggest if this witness can be taken back to the safe house, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Defence, would you be able to guide the Chamber on this issue?  Do you have any idea how long you might take?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Well, it's hard to gauge before hearing the witness.  But I know it -- for reasons which I don't have to stress, it will not be a short cross-examination for Witness CNAE.  So chances are that I will not be able to conclude it today and it will have to be finished Monday when we return from Kigali.  So, maybe, to save time, we can start with the cross-examination of that witness, and then proceed directly with CNAE thereafter.  But I'm at Your Honours' guidance.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  Then Witness CN -- is it BT, Counsel?  
MS. MAPOSA:
CNBA, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
CNBA should be taken back to the safe house.  
MS. MAPOSA:
Obliged, Madam President.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Witness.  

THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we would like to give you some information regarding the proceedings in this Trial Chamber.  And we thank you for coming.  But before we do that, we want you to learn to switch on and off your microphone when you -- when you are not speaking.  Switch it on when you are speaking, and switch it off when you have finished.  If you leave it open and there is another microphone on, it interrupts the proceedings -- the hearing of the interpreters and the recorders and everybody in the -- this courtroom.  We thank you.  

Registry, could you administer the oath, and thereafter we will proceed to give the witness some information regarding these proceedings.  
(Declaration made by Witness CNAE in Kinyarwanda) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, this is how these proceedings are conducted in this Tribunal.  You will be led in your evidence-in-chief by the Prosecution, which is seated on your right hand.  The Prosecution team is seated on your right hand.  After the Prosecution has finished asking you questions, the Defence will in turn ask you questions.  The Defence is seated on your left hand.  The Judges may also ask you questions on any issue at any point in time during the proceedings.  

If you have not understood a question, ask for it to be repeated.  Listen carefully to all the questions and answer them briefly and directly.  If you do so, that will enable the Trial Chamber and yourself to conclude your testimony quickly.  Those are the few pieces of information that we wanted to bring to your attention.  

One final matter, Witness, is that we require civility from all parties in this case.  From Defence counsel, Prosecution counsel, witnesses, the Trial Chamber, and everybody in these proceedings.  So we expect you to be civil to both parties when you are being questioned, and we expect them, in turn, to be civil to you.  And if you have not understood anything you may tell us and we can explain it further.  

Witness, have you understood?  
THE WITNESS:
I understood you well, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  

Prosecution Counsel, we are in open session as well.  You can guide us as to where you want to begin.  
MS. MAPOSA:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  This witness will be talking about some other Prosecution witness who are protected, and about himself also, Your Honours, and about Defence witnesses who are protected.  So I am requesting for a closed session, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  

Members of the public, we request you to leave at this stage.  We regret this, but we have to discuss these matters in a closed session to avoid disclosing the identity of the witness.  

Could any interpreter from the Kinyarwanda booth come down as we move into closed session to assist the witness, please.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 7 to 40] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

MR. DIALLO: 
     We are now in open session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness.  We are now in open session.  Can you hear the Trial Chamber, Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We are now in open session, which means that the public is free to attend this session.  Therefore, be careful not to give any information that may lead to your identity being exposed.  

Yes, Defence Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm about to address the topic of Gacaca proceedings, but before that, I would like to wrap up on your statement of 1998.  And you told us that you have met with representatives of the Prosecutor Saturday and Sunday, earlier this morning.  Can you confirm that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	How many hours did you spend with them on Saturday? 
A.	I was healing, and I told them that I was tired, and they left immediately.  They did not spend a lot of time with me.  
Q.	And on Sunday how long did you spend with them? 
A.	They came to visit me, and I told them that I was feeling well.  So we spent over one hour, slightly over one hour, together. 
Q.	And during that hour, the thing you discussed is your statement of 1998; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  They read back my statement to me. 
Q.	And when they read your statement back to you, did you -- I imagine that you protested vehemently, saying, "My God, there is nothing accurate in that statement."  Did you lodge a complaint?  What did you do?  What was your reaction? 
A.	I discussed with them, and they made corrections, the same corrections I have pointed out here.  The other aspects of my statement are correct.  There was nothing to change there.  You can ask them.  We discussed my statement at some length. 
Q.	Because if we believe your testimony of this morning, there is little information in that statement, according to you anyway, that properly reflects what you told them back in 1998.  Do you agree with me? 
A.	I believe that we should attach more importance to my statement, the Kinyarwanda version of it, rather than attaching any credibility to a statement that was recorded in a language that I do not understand, by someone who did not properly record the statement.  
Q.	There is no Kinyarwanda version of your statement, only a French and an English one.  And you signed the French one after a translator certified that it was correctly translated to you.  You signed it.  So that's why I'm putting to you that your reaction must have been quite violent when you realised how different the content of your statement is from your actual testimony.  That what's I'm asking you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, Counsel, The witness has answered that question.  He has said, "I discussed with them, they made corrections, the same corrections I have pointed out here.  The other aspects of my statement are correct."  So you could move on, Counsel. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	And during your interview with the Prosecutor, did you at any time talk about (By order of the Court, this name was extracted and kept under separate cover)? 
A.	They simply read back my statement to me. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Counsel, we'd like to remind you that we are in open session.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	So no other topics than your statement -- than your statement were discussed.  That's your testimony? 
A.	That is correct.  That is all what we discussed, and they asked me to be ready because I could be called upon to testify at any moment. 
Q.	And all the details that you added, not the corrections but the information which does not figure in your statement -- did they take notes when you gave that -- when you gave them that information? 
A.	All the corrections I made to my 1998 statement were reflected.  They reflected all those changes on a copy of the statement.  
Q.	Before you came to Arusha or after you arrived here?  When were these corrections made to your statement of 1998? 
A.	Counsel, I have stated that they came to see me on Saturday, and I told them that I was unwell.  They came back yesterday, and I told them that there were some elements in my statement that I did not provide them during my interview with the investigators.  
Q.	And you confirm that since 1998, Sunday, yesterday in fact, is the first time when you met representatives from the office of the prosecutor to make corrections to your statement.  You confirm that? 
A.	I used to discuss with representatives of the office of the prosecutor in Kigali, but those who came to see me yesterday were representatives of the Office of the Prosecutor here in Arusha, and it was the first time I was seeing them. 
Q.	So in Kigali you saw representatives of the Office of the Prosecutor after you gave your statement in 1998? 
A.	Whenever they needed to see me, they could come to see me, and if they had questions, I would answer them.  
Q.	Did you -- did you give them more statements after your 1998 statement? 
A.	Each time they read back my statement to me, I made corrections thereon.  At any rate, I did not give any other statement other than the 1998 statement, but I do not know whether the outcome of our interviews each time they came to see me could be construed as a statement.  I signed the papers represented to me, but I don't know if they could be considered as statements. 
Q.	And the papers you signed after your 1998 statement, were they containing the correction which you have mentioned in your testimony this morning? 
A.	I have told you that what I testified today is what I told them.  And yesterday, when my statement was read back to me, I made corrections where there were mistakes.  For instance, there is part where it is stated that the flag was raised at Alfred's house.  I made a correction and said that the person was not Alfred but Evalde.  So you see, there were mistakes, and each time I saw a mistake, I asked them to correct it.  
Q.	So apparently, we have not been able to cover all the corrections to your statement.  To wrap up on that topic, I suggest to you, Mr. Witness, that if your testimony is so strikingly different from your statement of 1998, it's because it's been adapted to fit the record of this case.  What do you have to say to that? 
A.	Counsel, that is your opinion.  I give it to you, it is your opinion, but I am testifying to incidents and events that I know.  I don't know about the testimonies of other witnesses. 
Q.	And why there is no consistency between your testimonies and your statements in the evidence of this case is because you are making this up.  What do you have to say to that? 
A.	I do not know how you can say that I am making up my testimony.  But if you have some evidence to the fact that I am making up my evidence, please present it before the Judges. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
	I think it would be safer now to move back into closed session, Your Honour, because I would mention names which -- which may lead to the identification of the witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Registry, could we move back into closed session.  

Members of the public we regret you have to leave at this stage of the proceedings, as matters we are going to discuss may identify the witness, who is a protected witness.
