MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.  The proceedings are resumed.  

Can we have the appearances of the parties for the record before we continue with the testimony of the witness.  Prosecution, please.  
MS. MAPOSA:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  The Prosecution bench is composed of 
Paul Ng'arua, senior trial attorney; Simba Mawere, assistant trial attorney; Diana Karanja, 
associate legal officer; Efrem Mutashya, language assistant; and four interns, namely, Godwin Manyiga, Catherine Gibson, Jamet Marion, Igor Barilik; and myself, Memory Maposa.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.

Defence Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Good morning, Madam President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  Along with Mr. Nzabonimana this morning, there's Anja Kortenaar, intern; Elise Legall, intern; Charles Brozille, intern; 
Célestin Kagango, investigator; Érick Sullivan, intern; Nathalie Leblanc, legal assistant; and 
myself, Philippe Larochelle.  Co-counsel Maître Courcelle-Labrousse will join us later in the morning.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.

Good morning, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We hope that you had a restful night and that you are able to continue with your testimony today without any problems.  Is that so, Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I had a restful night and I'm ready to continue with my testimony.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  

Prosecution Counsel.  
MS. MAPOSA:
I understand there's still examination-in-chief, Madam President, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Sorry.  

Defence Counsel.  We are in open session.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Yes.  I would require that we move into a closed session because the last topic which I want to deal with with that witness will be -- could likely allow people to identify him, so it would be preferable to move into a closed session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registrar, could you arrange for a closed session.

Members of the public, we regret you have to leave now for the reasons given by learned counsel for the Defence.  This is a protected witness.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 3 to 63] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera) 
(Pages 1 to 2 by Claudette Ask) 






















MR. MATEMANGA:
We are in open session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecution Counsel. 
MS. MAPOSA:
Madam President, Your Honours, we are applying for the production of two documents that were used in the cross-examination of Witness T109.

The first document, Madam President, Your Honours, is the statement of T109 dated 
18 (sic) January 2010.  And the motivation is dated 3 June 2010.  And I have served the Defence with this -- with the motivation and the statement. 

If registry can assist. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, is the statement duly underlined?  
MS. MAPOSA:
Yes, Madam President, Your Honours, it's duly underlined. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Defence Counsel, any objection?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
No, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The statement of the witness dated 18th (sic) January 2010, with the motivation dated 3 June are tendered as one exhibit for the Prosecution.  And it is Prosecution Exhibit --  
MR. MATEMANGA:  
P. 58. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
P. 58, under seal, as it contains the personal particulars of the witness who is a protected witness. 
MS. MAPOSA:
Madam President, Your Honours, the statement is dated 13 January 2010. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Thank you for that correction.  The statement is dated 18th January, not June. 

Counsel, is the date 18th or is it some other date?
MS. MAPOSA:  
It's 1-3, Madam President, Your Honours.  13 January.  

MADAM PRESIDENT:  
Okay.  Then let's start over again.  The statement of the witness dated 13th January 2010 and the accompanying motivation dated 3rd June 2010 are tendered as one exhibit, P. 58, under seal. 
(Exhibit No. P. 58 admitted, under seal) 
MS. MAPOSA:
Yes.  The second document, Madam President, Your Honours, is a statement of Witness T109 dated 23 May 2010, and the motivation is dated 3 June 2010. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Defence Counsel. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
No objection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The statement of the witness dated 23rd May 2010 and the accompanying motivation dated the 
	3rd June 2010 is tendered as a Prosecution exhibit, P. 59, under seal. 

Registry, is that correct?  
MR. MATEMANGA:  
Yes, it's correct. 
(Exhibit No. P. 59 admitted, under seal) 
MS. MAPOSA:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  That's all. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Defence Counsel, any exhibits?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
We have left over from Witness T28 a picture which was annotated by the witness.  I have a justification here.  

If the registry could assist we could file that pic -- that photograph in. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What date is the justification?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
2nd June 2010. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
We -- we have one small issue to raise about this photograph, subject to which we'll not have a problem.  We would like to know who took this photograph and the approximate date of taking of this photograph.  And that being given, then we'll have no problem. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  But, Counsel, this is information which you should have solicited before we came to this stage. 

Defence Counsel. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I entirely agree with what you just stated.  There was no objection at the time the photograph was used.  It was the -- the submissions of the Prosecutor I think are not warranted at this stage.  If there's any -- if there were any doubts as to -- as to the reliability or the provenance of that picture, it should have been raised at an earlier stage, not now when the -- the witness is no longer here and cannot provide any answers.  I would not offer testimony.  I don't think it would be proper. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
Madam President, Your Honours, I do not have the slightest idea that this photograph was taken by the witness.  That was not the case.  However, since it was not attempted to be put at that time, that's why we did not object to it.  We did not know for what reasons the -- the Defence had brought this matter.  But I think this is a matter that counsel can make us aware of in -- in due course.  And we'll then not have any objection when that information is provided for. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
We will send an email with the information required by the Prosecutor as soon as we -- I know it's Fernand Batard who took the picture, but as to the date I can -- as to the date I cannot -- I am told it's July 2009 when the picture was taken. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
In that event we have no objection. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Great.  If the registry could assist we can then -- we could then file that picture. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The picture and the justification -- the picture annotated by Witness T28 and the accompanying justification dated 2nd June 2010 is -- are entered as one exhibit for the Defence and marked Exhibit --  
MR. MATEMANGA:  
D. 39. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
D. 39. 
(Exhibit No. D. 39 admitted) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
Yes.  Registry, if we could see the exhibits, please. 

Any other matter before we close this session?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
No.  That will be all.  Yes.  I am told that -- I am told that we are denied access to Witness CNAO, although he has finished his testimony.  My understanding is that the Prosecutor will have to move for a recall if he wishes to do so, but in the meantime I don't think there should be -- I don't think there should be any prohibitions on the Defence for Nzabonimana meeting with Mr. -- he is no longer a protected witness, so with Mr. Mporanzi who is still in -- who is still in Arusha and is about to leave.  So I would require Your Honours to clarify with the registrar so that it can inform WVSS that at this stage there is no -- nothing prohibiting the Defence from greeting Mr. Mporanzi before he returns to his country of current residence. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, what is the position?  We -- we need the information before we can make such a directive, which information we lack.  So it's not possible for us to make the direction but -- and unfortunately we are closing this session shortly, but we will -- what we can do is ask the registry to look into this matter and apprise the Chamber, which is not disappearing with the close of this session. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
With your leave, Madam President, I -- I think if the Chamber can just clarify that the examination of that witness is indeed finished and that the Prosecutor is -- that the cross-examination is not suspended but, rather, the Prosecutor can move for a recall if, following their investigations, they deem it necessary. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We did this -- discharged this witness in the proceedings in which he testified.  And we told him his testimony had come to an end and he could leave.  So we -- we don't think that we need to make any further directions in that regard. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Indeed, Madam President.  With what you've just said it is clear, and we will act on this. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  This has been a long session and we are pleased to note that there have been more serene moments than difficult ones.  

We would like to thank and congratulate everybody for your contribution towards a successful completion of this session.  We need to make particular mention of lead counsel and co-counsel and their team, respective teams, registry staff, interpreters and recorders who do a difficult job,  technicians, security personnel, and last but not least our Chamber staff who have supported us throughout this session. 

We would also like to thank all other invisible players who do not appear in this courtroom but who play a vital role in facilitating these proceedings in one way or another.  

We would like to wish those who are travelling safe journey, and for those who are staying an enjoyable stay. 

Yes.  I see Mr. Prosecutor standing up. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
Yes.  Sorry, Madam President.  We -- we had one small matter to raise with the Defence and I'm sorry that we somehow did not come in at the right -- exactly the right moment. 

It's just about the -- the batting order of the Defence for the witnesses they intend to call from the 
5th to 15th of July when the session starts.  

My Lords, if you can make facility for us to discuss that, we'll appreciate very much. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  But we don't need to facilitate that.  The Defence counsel and the Prosecution counsel know that the Chamber approves of such discussions, and indeed they should take place at all times to facilitate these proceedings.  But in due course we shall also issue a decision regarding this matter before the proceedings restart. 

That said, these proceedings are adjourned to the 5th of July 2010. 
(Court adjourned at 1625H)
