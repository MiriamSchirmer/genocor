P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, the 6th of November 2008, for the hearing of oral arguments on the severance of Ngirumpatse in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Could we have the appearances, please. 
MR. WEBSTER:
The appearances are the same for the Prosecution, Your Honour.  Good morning to the Court and to the Defence, to the Registry, everyone. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  
MR. SOW:
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Good morning to members of the 
Office of the Prosecutor, everyone.  There is no change in the appearances of Édouard Karemera's team.  Thank you.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, Your Honours, I would like to greet the Chamber on behalf of the Ngirumpatse team.  As the Chamber can see, there's always change in our team, and today we have Mrs. Hounkpatin, the lead counsel, myself, and Marina Yetongnon, our assistant.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. NIMY:
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Good morning to our learned friends on the other side.  There is no major change in our team.  I would simply like to announce the return of our assistant, Léopold Nsengiyumva, who is right here.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

We have received the submissions from all parties in response to our request for assistance in deciding on the way forward.  And we have concluded that the view expressed by each counsel in this matter, that the severance should not be the first consideration, is, probably, quite correct.  So we have decided to not consider the issue of severance today.  Of course, this does not mean that if the circumstances evolve in a manner which requires reconsideration, that we would not do so.  But in view of the circumstances today, we agree that it is not necessary to make any decision with regard to severance.  

With regard to the continuation of the trial, the submissions of Mathieu Ngirumpatse -- on behalf of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, have indicated his consent to the continuation of the trial in his absence on certain conditions being met.  And in relation to that, the Chamber considers that what would be appropriate would be that the trial should sit -- the Chamber should sit four days per week, that is, Monday to Friday, and that the full transcripts would be transmitted regularly, at regular intervals, to Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and that he should have transmitted to him the video -- witness videos of the proceedings.  Arrangements will be made to provide equipment in his hospital room for review of these videotapes.  

We consider that the timing of the resumption of the case, particularly bearing in mind that the same Trial Chamber is hearing the case against Callixte Kalimanzira, which we have scheduled -- or, we are in the process of scheduling to conclude towards the end of January 2009 -- that it will be reasonable for the resumption of this case to be scheduled for the 2nd of February 2009, and that the first event on the scheduling calendar would be a status conference on that date.  

Now, those are the considerations -- the deliberations we have had emerging from the submissions that we have received, and we will very briefly hear you in relation to that, but I believe the person who should lead on this issue is Ngirumpatse.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I thank you for giving me the floor on behalf of Mathieu Ngirumpatse and I've taken due note of the decisions of the Chamber.  

I believe that they tally substantially with the suggestions that we propose as alternatives to severance, but that they do not meet all our concerns in that, in our opinion, they ignore what we believe was a need to take stock at some point -- some reasonable period that could be set in mid- or the end of January to assess the situation in keeping with the health condition of Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  

And we stated that as a prior condition to any discussion on severance, we consider that the primary issue was the implementation of the Stanisic case law by which the Appeals Chamber on 
6 May 2008 recalled that the primary right of the accused was to be present at his own trial.  
And that it is in the light of that decision that we believe that it is in our interest to take stock of the medical condition of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and his ability to be present at his own trial -- or to take part in his own defence.  

I believe that when the Chamber proposes to set the status conference on 2 February 2009, for the resumption of the trial on 2 February 2009, it is probably sidelining the consideration of 
Mathieu Ngirumpatse's health condition on 2 February 2009.  And presuming that he would be well enough on that date so we could implement the conditions or the propositions that have been made, I believe that it is necessary -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Excuse me, Mr. Weyl, I had understood from the submissions filed on behalf of Mathieu Ngirumpatse that he was consenting to the trial to proceed in his absence.  Are you saying that is not the position? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, on behalf of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, we have submitted that to the extent that he can effectively participate in his own defence, he would accept or agree to be represented by his counsel, so the trial can continue in his intellectual presence -- in his concerted presence with his counsel, even though he would not be physically present in the courtroom.  

We did not say that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was waiving his right, and we believe we were very clear on that point when we say that physical presence was excluded -- as Dr. Epée told us that 
Mathieu Ngirumpatse's physical presence in the courtroom should be ruled out.  And we said that depending on the progress of his treatment, we thought that he could be present in the courtroom through his counsel, in the context of a defence in which he could participate from a distance.  We did not say that Mathieu Ngirumpatse agreed to be tried in his absence.  We never said so.  The idea was that he would be tried in this case and be represented as much as possible, and depending on the witnesses to be called, represented by his counsel.  

If it could be organised for consultation with him over time, one of our essential arguments was that we were waiting -- and we would like to have at least 15 days before the opening of the session, to take stock and to ensure ourselves that all the conditions have been fulfilled for us to assist 
Mathieu Ngirumpatse by representing him in this courtroom, and being in a position to receive correct instructions from him.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, between now and the end of February, there are many more than just 15 days.  The Chamber does not expect that your representation will be confined to 15 days.  We expect that you will be constantly monitoring the situation.  

You have already filed certain confidential motions, which the Chamber will be adjudicating upon, and if there is a change in his health position, of which you are aware, one does not need a status conference to evaluate it.  So the possibility of constant evaluation exists and we would expect that your duty, as counsel, would necessarily involve that these evaluations will be ongoing.  

So the position of the Chamber is that a public hearing is not necessary for these evaluations to continue.  And at any time there's a change which warrants -- a change in his health condition which warrants a variation of the order that we've made, that you would be at liberty to move the Court in that direction.  

I must say that there was one thing I had omitted to say earlier, which is, also, I think, significant.  And in light of the information that we currently have seized -- the medical opinion that we already have indicates that Ngirumpatse would not be fit to be in court on the 2nd of February, unless that changes. And we have decided that in order to facilitate him, on account of his health situation, that we have decided to vary the order in which the Defence should be represented and that immediately after Karemera's defence has concluded, that Ngirumpatse -- that Nzirorera should present his defence and then Ngirumpatse would present his defence after Nzirorera.  So there will be a variation in the order in which defences are represented to accommodate the factual situation in which we find ourselves.  

Mr. Weyl, the main point of my intervention was to suggest to you that a public hearing is not necessary for constant monitoring and evaluation of Mr. Ngirumpatse's health situation.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, given that it is not counsel that carries out a medical examination, and, as the Chamber knows, counsel has no other choice than to inform the Chamber on the progress of the situation so that the Chamber knows, but not always to the best of everyone's knowledge, we are -- we can only inform the Chamber of what we know to the best of our knowledge.  

But it would appear that for things to be properly conducted for the continuation of the trial, if such continuation is possible, there should be a status conference.  Or the fact that there is a status conference at the beginning of the resumption of the trial does not enable anyone to take appropriate measures in view of the progress of the situation.  

If there is a suggestion that there should be a resumption of the trial on the same day as the status conference, which is set to assess the progress of the situation, then, I believe that the Trial Chamber should give that minimum interval of 15 days between taking stock of the situation for all the parties and the resumption of the trial with all the witnesses present in the box.  And it is in the interests of everyone to -- to give a small interval to everyone, to step back a bit and see what the situation looks like after the status conference.  So I believe that it would be desirable -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl -- Mr. Weyl, what would be the purpose of this?  We already have a clear medical opinion that Mathieu Ngirumpatse is unlikely to be fit to be in court on the 2nd of February.  The only thing that could change is that his health gets better than anticipated.  If his health gets better than anticipated, then he can come to court.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, in the observations of Dr. Epée, I think there is something which was amalgamated:  The period of the serious crisis, which makes it impossible for Mathieu Ngirumpatse to be involved in any way in his defence; and then the treatment during which he will be incapacitated but will be recovering his physical and mental capacities slowly.  His ability to concentrate, his ability to work on his case -- and, I'm making a distinction between the period of the paroxystic -- the paroxystic period and the time during which he will have started to recover. 

Once he begins to recover and will be able, from afar, to participate in his defence, we are not yet at that stage, and I do believe that we can hope that, for the month of January, when the serious crisis situation would have passed, we'll have started a recovery period.  But I'm not a doctor, and I think that this distinction being made between the period of the serious crisis and the treatment period should be made, and this is why we are saying that we need to look at the issue once again in January, so that we are able to assess.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, there is no point in wasting time on this issue, because that's where we are at the moment, I think.  It's very easy to hold a status conference during the week of the 12th of January, but it just didn't seem a useful way to allocate the efforts of everybody and to make everybody travel for something which did not seem necessary.  But if you want to come for a status conference, we are here, we're available, and we're always ready to move forward in the case.  

What it seemed to me was that, because we had accepted the medical opinion that it was unlikely that Ngirumpatse would be fit to be in court on the 2nd of February, there didn't seem to be any need for a status conference, unless his condition improved.  And if his condition improved, then he just comes to court.  

Dr. Epée did say that things could happen for the better, and, if it did, he just comes to court.  If his condition deteriorates and it becomes improbable that he could participate in the proceedings in any manner, then we simply have to go ahead with considering the submissions with regard to severance.  
If his condition improves, he comes to court.  If his condition deteriorates, then we consider severance.  And that is something which we could activate on your motion.  If, at some stage between now and February, you wanted to submit that his condition had deteriorated and he could not participate in a trial in any manner, therefore, we need to consider severing him from the case, then you simply file an application to that effect.  But if you would feel better seeing us in mid-January, we could make such an order.  Maybe you miss our company, more than we thought?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, to know more of the situation than God, that would depend on the solution that the President of the Tribunal would reserve to our motions and filings, and what the Chamber will decide on regarding the other motions that we have submitted.  

Given this fact, I believe I have implored sufficiently the Chamber and the President of the Tribunal -- if he is hearing us in that capacity in this Chamber -- to provide us with the indications in this regard.  And I believe the Chamber and the President should be able to take measures extremely rapidly.  I thank you very much, Mr. President. 
MS. HOUNKAPATIN:
Maybe with two voices you'll hear what we are trying to say.  I can only supplement what my 
learned friend Frédéric Weyl was saying with regard to the modalities to be placed -- put in place, so that counsel can have  information that is necessary and be in regular and constant contact with 
Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel is not speaking into her microphone, Mr. President, can she be informed of that?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
As presiding Judge over this case, that you may be able to give instructions -- I don't know how this is done administratively -- but I'm dealing with what is of interest to me, and I'm seeking the results that I want so that you can give instructions, such that when we make requests to accomplish missions to be able to meet with our client, that there be no difficulties placed in our way, and that we are not obliged to negotiate for hours and hours and days and days before we are able to obtain the necessary commissions.  

I do believe that your order issued today can be supplemented further by a sentence, which I'll formulate in this manner.  Our Chambers are not situated in Arusha.  We have professional commitments elsewhere, and this particular situation of Mathieu Ngirumpatse's health is also a supplementary consideration in the duties that are incumbent upon us.  And we, as professionals, must do this job and should not consider it as an extra job that we're doing.  We must have the material facilities to be able to ensure that things can develop; that Mathieu Ngirumpatse's health will improve so that this trial may proceed.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, our brief deliberation has raised the issue that I may not have been -- I might not have been quite clear.  

The Chamber had accepted that Mathieu Ngirumpatse is entitled to be able to participate in the case whether he was physically in court or not.  And I failed to say, which was intended to be communicated, that we would expect that he will be participating in the trial from his hospital bed if he was not able to be in court for that reason.  And so that was intended to be communicated when I indicated that we'll be making provisions for him to have both the written transcripts and the video of the witness testimonies, and we'll also be ensuring that the Tribunal provides the equipment that would enable him to see those videos.  

The scheduling of the case -- guaranteeing that the case will be scheduled only on 
Monday to Thursday -- was also intended to ensure that counsel will have adequate time and opportunity to be present with him at his hospital location to take instructions and to discuss developments of the case.  

So if Mr. Weyl was raising questions to discuss that position, we have already agreed that that would be a condition that needed to be satisfied for the continuation of the trial.  If his health condition deteriorated and he could not do that, then, at that stage, we would have to consider whether severance would be the appropriate remedy.  And if his health condition improved, and he was able to come to court, then that would be the best possible solution.  

Mr. Weyl, does that clarify the problem that was raised by you? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, that response to our concern regarding the continuation of the trial -- the formulation which you used regarding the possibility of participating in the trial from his hospital bed -- raises other issues concerning other motions with which you have been seized, both in regard to yourself as a Chamber, and yourself as the presiding Judge and the President of the Tribunal.  

What you call the hospital bed raises, obviously, problems for us, because it's not necessarily a situation which contributes best to the possibility of Mathieu Ngirumpatse's recovery.  The present conditions of his existence need to be looked at confidentially, and that will not remove his stress 
and -- a deterioration of his situation and a delay of his recovery.  

You have been seized of a motion concerning this matter and the need for you to seek a solution.  As President of the Tribunal, we have also seized you of our concern regarding his present situation.  When, during this hearing, you're talking about a hospital bed, we do not wish to take this as an answer to our concern.  We really wish that measures be taken such that Mathieu Ngirumpatse can recover.  And this would go to the solution that we have sought from the Chamber and from the 
President of the Tribunal, on the other, and they are urgent.  Otherwise, I don't think it would be from a hospital bed that Mathieu Ngirumpatse will be able to participate in a trial in his absence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, I used the phrase "hospital bed" just to be clear about the definition of participation in the trial.  I am not the doctor.  I'm not prescribing the quality of the care that he has or where it should be taking place, and I'm also aware of the confidential motions that you've filed which have to be considered.  

I was not saying that he had to be in a hospital bed.  I was just using that phrase to indicate that the Chamber was intending, by our order, that he would be able to participate in the trial by having access to the transcripts, to the videotapes and have adequate time and facilities for instructing his counsel; so that was the point. 
MR. WEYL:
Now, Mr. President, I have almost all my answers and I thank you for that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Yes, Mr. Sow.
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I would like to ask the Chamber whether they can indicate to us the availability of our witnesses.  Would it be a matter of having them -- hearing them before the status conference of the 
2nd of February, yes or no?  In which case, we would have to avoid the situations that we have been placed in the past and which we are all aware of.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, that is an issue which, I agree, is an important issue and that may need a status conference.  When we discussed it and were considering what was reasonable, we had expected that any issues concerning a variation in Mr. Ngirumpatse's condition would be the subject of confidential motions between Ngirumpatse and the Chamber, and that we would be constantly monitoring and evaluating his situation.  That if there was a variation in his condition, which could have had an impact on the trial, then, it would give us an opportunity to address it, if and when it arose.  

So we considered that the current medical condition of Ngirumpatse was most likely to continue to the extent that he would not be able to be in court on the 2nd of February, but, that, if given adequate time and facilities, he would be able to instruct his counsel.  That being the case, there would be no impediment to the trial commencing on the 2nd of February.  

If, in the interval, there was a variation of his condition, then we would address it as soon as we had information about it.  But again, if your ability to manage your defence would be improved by having a status conference in mid-January, that is something we could easily accommodate.  
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Mr. President, I've taken due note of your response. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but you still have to assist us because we have to decide whether to have the conference or not.  You see, we had thought the conference would not be necessary, but you are managing your defence and we would need your assistance in making a proper adjudication on this issue.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, at any rate I think that since we need to assess the health status of Mr. Ngirumpatse, a status conference will be necessary to enable the parties to know the direction of the trial.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Robinson -- oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Nimy.  
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

I would like, first, to say that I do not understand why it is only on the basis of the submission of the Ngirumpatse team that you've drawn a whole range of decisions and made proposals for the continuation of the trial, and you've said nothing on the submissions of the other parties.  
If you have also read through Nzirorera's submission, then we'll be interested to know what you think about it in terms of our alternative solutions.  Because you would've noticed in our submission that what is of concern to us is, first of all, the health condition of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and we consider that this right is fundamental, and that the Chamber should devote its full attention to it and it is on 
Mathieu Ngirumpatse's health condition that every other thing depends.  

We have further proposed that, in this connection, Ngirumpatse's transfer to a more specialised and more efficient health facility than Nairobi should be decided upon by the Chamber. 

Further, we also consider that for as long as Mr. Ngirumpatse will not have recovered his capacities, we will wait.  We will wait.  We can wait for six months if we have to, and we would like to know what the Chamber thinks of that proposal.  

And when I heard you say today on when you relied only on Ngirumpatse's submission that the trial could continue with his agreement, and that the variation in the order of the presentation of witnesses could take place, I did not understand, Mr. President.  If the trial has to continue with the consent of Ngirumpatse, then, it will continue in the order of presentation of evidence as decided upon by your Chamber.  

This means that after Karemera, Ngirumpatse will have to present his case and Nzirorera will come after -- unless the Chamber explains to us why this order -- why this change in the order of presentation of evidence is necessary.  And I believe that this decision that you've announced is premature, in any case.  We needed to wait for the next session that you set for 2 February for the evaluation of the health situation of Mathieu Ngirumpatse to address this issue of the change of the order of case presentation, but it was not supposed to be decided upon or even suggested today.  

Mr. President, we believe that the constraints -- and it is clear from the decisions of the Tribunal, we are not the ones stating this -- the requirements of the completion strategy should not interfere in any way with the fair conduct of this trial with regard to the Accused.  And we would like to remind the Chamber that we are not bound by the completion strategy of the Tribunal.  We are bound by the fairness of the trial to which the Accused are fully entitled.  

That, Mr. President, are the few points I wanted to raise to the attention of the Chamber, and I would like you to say something on them, especially, as in our submission, we went even further.  

You see, Mr. President, we have had a very disrupting and a very disturbing trial.  In the light of what we are hearing in connection to its fairness, it's frightening, especially with what we've had with the Prosecutor with respect to disclosure obligations, hidden documents and all of that.  We've made motions.  We've cited the Muberuka, Mudahinyuka cases and we've called for the punishment of such violations.  And so we are not in a position to consider that all the repetition of all these -- these fundamental defects makes us to think that we are looking at a fair trial.  And we have even proposed the relocation of this trial to a national jurisdiction that will guarantee the fairness of this trial.  

These are all issues that we've presented to your attention, and we would like you to tell us what you think of them so that we should not rely only on the submission of Ngirumpatse.  The entire hearing of today should not be devoted entirely to Ngirumpatse's submission.  

I'm done, Mr. President, and I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, it's obvious that your listening was rather incomplete.  As far as I was aware, your submissions included a suggestion that the severance should not take place at this time.  The Chamber ruled that the severance should not take place at this time.  

Your submissions included a submission that Ngirumpatse's right to be present at his trial and participate should be respected.  The submissions that we made addressed that issue in detail to the extent that Mathieu Ngirumpatse's counsel are satisfied that adequate arrangements were made in that regard.  

So it's not true that the substance of your submissions have been ignored.  What was meritorious was given proper weight and what was not meritorious was rejected.  But it is not necessary to say that in great detail; but, in substance, the issues have been addressed.  I don't think it's also necessary to address matters which are of peripheral or minimal importance and we ignored those for that reason.  

Now, we think that the issue of the right of each accused person to have a fair and expeditious trial is a matter which the Court must pay attention to, and we don't think that indefinite delays are something which attests fairness.  And that is an important motivation in the decision-making process that we're undertaking at the moment.  So those would be a few remarks we could make in response to the points you've raised.  

Yes, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Your Honours.  

First of all, let me express my appreciation and my respect for the Ngirumpatse Defence team in their careful consideration of this issue, and thank the Court for its decision.  

Just for the purposes of the record, I would like us to be complete with the issues that we were intending to address today.  In the Prosecution's submissions, we did -- or, rather, let me begin again.  

In Ngirumpatse's -- excuse me, in Nzirorera's submissions, he raised the issue of the deadline that was established by the Court's previous orders to submit his witness list tommorow, the 7th of November, and I would appreciate it if the Court clarified that issue, since it was something that Nzirorera himself brought up, and if the Court would clarify that that filing should be made on a timely basis tomorrow.  

I also appreciate Mr. Nimy's comments -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Excuse me, I don't understand, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
In Mr. Robinson's written submission -- or the Nzirorera's team written submission they had indicated that the deadline that this Court had set for filing a revised witness list on the 7th of November would have to be changed, in light of the circumstances.  

The Chamber has not made a decision on that portion of the Nzirorera's team submission, and I would urge it to do so in a very explicit manner.  In other words, to state that all of the submissions that were due to be filed tomorrow, the 7th November, should be filed tomorrow, the 7th of November; that's one issue.  

The other:  It's a relief, quite frankly, to hear Mr. Nimy raise the issue of the ordering of the Defence cases because clearly he's had an opportunity to be heard on that issue.  It's not something that should have taken him by surprise, since a reference to that possibility was made in the Prosecution's submission of Monday, the 3rd of November, and, again, in our submission that was filed yesterday.  

So it is an issue that all parties should have anticipated addressing, and he has made himself heard on this issue and the Chamber's certainly entitled to make rulings on that issue under Rule 90(F).  So there is the fact that we have thrashed it out sufficiently on the record is satisfying to the Prosecution.

In our submissions, we also suggested that the Chamber order regular updates from the chief medical officer, and I think it would help us all if that order was made explicit on the record.  So if we could have either bi-weekly or monthly updates from the registry as to Mr. Ngirumpatse's health, I think it would assist us, if we encountered any problems with going forward on the 2nd of February.  So somehow his health status could be monitored and officially communicated to the parties and the Chamber on a regular basis -- at least, monthly and even possibly every two weeks, that would be helpful.  But beyond that, we're very satisfied with the interim orders that the Chamber has made.  

As for the status conference, the Prosecution does not believe we need to set a date for one at this time.  I would think that the parties should be able to communicate with each other and with the Chamber, and that if a status conference was necessary, that one be arranged in a fairly short order.  But I'll leave that matter to the Court's discretion.  

Clearly, Mr. Sow and Mr. Weyl think one is necessary.  We don't think it's necessary and we prefer it not be scheduled.  But if it's an urgent or an important matter for the Defence, we will defer to the Court's decision-making on that issue.  

I think we've addressed everything and I'll end my submission there, Your Honour.  If the Court has any further enquiry of me, I'll be happy to respond.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Nimy, just for clarification:  The point raised by Mr. Webster, the specific issue with regard to the request for additional time to file submissions, when that order was made, the Chamber proprio motu gave leave to appeal.  We are not aware that any appeal was filed and we think that the time for appeal has elapsed.  Is that the position?  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, with your leave, I will consult with my lead counsel on this precise issue.  In a short while from now, I'll give you a more reliable answer.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let me explain to you our position.  If there's been no appeal, we don't propose to vary our order and grant additional time for compliance.  So in light of our present information -- and, as I said, we have made some preliminary enquiries and we are not aware that any notice of appeal has been filed -- and we think that the time limit for the appeal has elapsed, the application for more time is denied.   

Mr. Weyl, I don't know what you wanted to address, but what we think we will do is to give a tentative indication of the week of 12th January as a time in lieu within which a status conference could be held, but we would like to make a final determination on that issue and communicate it to you in due course.  But we give notice of that week as a time in lieu within which a status conference may be held, but that will be discussed informally and a formal decision will be made in due course.  

Was there something else that you wished to address us? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, it was precisely that point I wanted to raise before the Chamber, to say that it was easier to cancel a status conference if it appears futile, instead of doing one, considering the day the -- the timetable -- considering the other duties of the -- that the counsels have to do and all the other considerations, but the Chamber beat me to it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  We think we can take our adjournment now.  We just wish a speedy recovery to Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  

My learned and distinguished brother has just made a very felicitous comment.  He has reminded me that this might be the last time we're together before Christmas, so I wish you a happy Christmas and a prosperous New Year. 

MR. WEBSTER:
The Court knows something that I didn't know.  Your Honour, I thought we were still coming together next week.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, I'm sorry, I'll withdraw those greetings.  I might renew them next week.  Thank you.  

We take our adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1123H)
