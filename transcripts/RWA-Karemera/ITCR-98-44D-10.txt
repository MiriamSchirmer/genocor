MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are called to order.  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  

Registrar, or, rather, your -- Prosecutor, is your counsel present?  If he's present, can you call the first witness? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Good morning, Your Honour.  Yes, the witness is here and ready to testify. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution.  

Mr. Roach, do you want to say something? 
MR. ROACH:
Yes, please.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You have the floor. 
MR. ROACH:
Yes, thank you.  I move at this time for an order for the exclusion of all proposed witnesses -- I have been advised that a proposed witness has been in the visitor's gallery and my request is that, before giving their testimony, witnesses not be permitted to be in the public gallery. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for Prosecution? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Is the comment that there is a witness in the gallery now or --
MR. ROACH:
I've been advised that one witness, a Mr. Rousseau, has been in the gallery, but I don't know if he's there at this present time.  But my request is that throughout the trial, proposed witnesses be excluded from the proceedings until the time of their testimony. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
At present, is there a Prosecution witness who is in the public gallery?
MR. WEBSTER:
There is no Prosecution witness that I can identify within the gallery.  The gallery is empty, but maybe Mr. Roach is talking about yesterday.  I'm not sure.  In any case, none of our factual witnesses have been present, as far as I know, in the gallery, yesterday or today.  The investigators certainly are not factual witnesses.  I think there may have been an expert -- not an expert, but a witness that prepared a report years after -- at least a year after the genocide.  I'm not sure if that's the witness that Mr. Roach is referring to, but I'm not aware of any witness, any Prosecution witness, that is in the gallery now. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecutor. 
(The witness entered the courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber decides to exclude all factual witnesses from the proceedings.  And as Mr. Roach has requested, they should not be present during the proceedings.  As of now, in any case, we have not noticed the presence of any Prosecution witness in the public gallery. 

We will begin with the first Prosecution witness, namely Mr. Baghel.  

Good morning, Mr. Baghel. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are a Prosecution witness.  Before the Prosecutor examines you in chief, as is -- of course, you are used to appearing before the Chambers of this Tribunal, and as you know, you have to make a solemn declaration.  The Defence will cross-examine you after the examination-in-chief, and the Judges may also put questions to you, if they think -- if they deem it necessary.  We therefore request that you make your solemn declaration. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
(Declaration made by Upendra Singh Baghel in English)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Mr. Baghel.  We also thank the registry.

Counsel for Prosecution, you have the floor.  Proceed with the examination-in-chief of the witness. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, we will begin with the direct examination by Mr. Baghel, Upendra.  Trial attorney Holo Makwaia will take the first witness.  I will take the second witness. 
UPENDRA SINGH BAGHEL,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you state your full name and age for the record, please?
A.	My name is Upendra Singh Baghel and my age -- my date of birth is 2nd March 1965.  So my age is 38 years.
Q.	You are currently employed --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honour, if the witness could spell his name, please, for clarity of the record.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I will spell it out again.  Upendra, U-P-E-N-D-R-A, Singh, S-I-N-G-H, Baghel, B-A-G-H-E-L.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	You are currently employed by the International --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, if you could observe a pause between the questions and answers so as to enable the interpreters to complete their interpretation.  I think this applies to both sides, to the witness as well as to the counsel.
MS. MAKWAIA:
I am obliged, Madam President. 
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, you are currently employed as an investigator at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.  For how long have you been so employed? 
A.	Myself, I have been employed for the last more than three and a half years.  I joined in the -- in the month of February 2000.
Q.	Prior to joining the ICTR, you worked in Angola and Bosnia, also for the United Nations, between 1996 and the year 2000; is that correct?
A.	Yes.  That's correct.
Q.	Can you briefly tell --
MR. MARTEL:
Madam President?  Madam President, please.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel? 
MR. MARTEL:
I would not like leading questions to be asked.  The witness should say where he worked.  The counsel should ask the witness where he worked and the answer should come from the witness and not from the counsel, please.  Thank you. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
If I may respond, Madam President, these are non-contentious facts which will not be in dispute, and I'm just trying to expedite the process, Your Honours, and I will later on enter the CV of the witness.  I will ask proper questions when it comes to proper matters which will be contentious, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Counsel.  You may continue. 
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Before the interruption, Mr. Baghel, I had asked you about your prior employment between 1996 and the year 2000.  You had worked for the United Nations in Bosnia and Angola; is that so?
A.	Yes, that's correct.
Q.	Now, briefly, what was the nature of your work in Bosnia and Angola?
A.	In Bosnia and Angola, I was part of the civilian police component of the peacekeeping missions.  In Bosnia, I was handling the assignment of special assistant to the deputy commissioner.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honours, the interpreters ask that the witness speak more directly into the microphone so that we could hear properly.  We are sorry for the interruption.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Maybe the microphone could be moved a bit.  It seems a bit far from --
THE WITNESS:
And in Angola, I was chief of CIVPOL operations.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, in the period between 1988 and 1995, you were employed by the government of India as a senior police officer; is that also correct?
A.	Yes.  That's also correct.
MR. MARTEL:
Once more, Madam President -- once more, Madam President, this is a leading question.  The question should be objective.  And the witness should give the answer.  It should not be Counsel for the Prosecution who gives the answers. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, this was a question related to the CV of the witness, but perhaps you could give us his CV if you have it.  Did you distribute it?  Have you already distributed the CV of the witness? 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Yes, Your Honour, the copy was sent to the court management in the bundles of the anticipated exhibits to be produced by this witness for distribution to Your Honours and the parties. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Perhaps the witness may confirm what is written in his CV and tell us whether there are any changes to be made to the CV; then the CV could be entered into evidence.  In that manner, you could proceed directly to substantive questions. 

Witness, do you have your CV with you? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have the CV with me. 

MS. MAKWAIA:
Actually, Your Honour, I had just two more questions, and all the questions I've been posing to the witness are directly derived from his CV, and then I was going to propose to tender it as a Prosecution exhibit, if Mr. Martel will allow me to do so, Your Honours. 
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Now, Mr. Baghel, I had asked you about a position you were holding in the -- in your government.  Could you please answer that question? 
A.	Before joining ICTR, I was the deputy commissioner of police in Bangalore city in India.  Before that, I have been superintendent of police of few districts in India, and other offices I held in India.
Q.	And just to complete your background, could you briefly tell the Court what kind of education you have?
A.	As far as educational background is concerned, I did Bachelor of Technology from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, in India.  

After that, through a competitive examination, I joined Indian police service and underwent two years course, which is probationary course, in national police academy, Hyderabad, in India.
Q.	Now, Mr. -- I'm waiting for the translation to go through.  Now, Mr. Baghel, have you prepared your CV that sums up what you have just been describing in this Chamber?
A.	Yes.  I have prepared.
Q.	And this is a document of three pages; is that correct?
A.	Yes, it's so.
Q.	It is titled, "Resume, Upendra S. Baghel"; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, at this stage, with your permission, I would like to tender Mr. Baghel's curriculum vitae as Prosecution Exhibit No. 1. 
MR. MARTEL:
Madam President? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel. 
MR. MARTEL:
According to rudimentary practice, the witness should recognise the document before it is tendered into evidence.  This is elementary.  I'm sorry to intervene, but these are questions, basic questions.  The witness should recognise or identify his CV before it is tendered into evidence. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Baghel, I asked you the question earlier on whether you had your CV with you.  Have you verified it?  Is it indeed your CV? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I have a copy before me, and I have verified, and this is the CV which I presume has been tendered.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We thank you. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours?  Just a procedural matter, because we've disclosed it to the registry.  Actually, he should have handed that copy of the CV in the registry's possession to the witness who would have recognised it, and that's the copy we were going to tender, Your Honour, and not vice versa 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The registry will give a copy of the document to the CV (sic).  Perhaps it will be better to inform the registry in advance of the documents that you would need so that the registry should bring the documents into the courtroom.  They did not have the document with them here.  Before the hearing, it is good to inform the registry of the documents that you will need so that they bring them along.  

May I turn to the Defence?  Do you have the document in question?  That is this CV.  Do you have it?  Did you receive it? 
MR. MARTEL:
No.  We don't have it.  According to practice, when a party wants to tender a document into evidence during the testimony of a witness, the said document should be disclosed as early as possible to the other party.  Personally, I do not have the CV of this gentleman. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, speaking for the Office of the Prosecutor, we served upon the CMS on the 14th of November a bundle of documents that this witness is going to use, including his CV, and yesterday, Your Honours, I personally informed the Court assistant of the documents I was going to rely on, not only this CV but also the bundles that will be entered. 
MR. MARTEL:
Madam President, in fact, my -- my learned colleague is giving us a very pertinent answer.  She gave us a whole bundle of documents.  According to practice -- and this is not only a practice required by courtesy but it is also a practice that is practical, so to speak.  So, as I was saying, according to practice, a few days before, at least a day before, we should be informed of the documents that will be used.  That was not done.  We do not know -- we do not have this document and would not know what other documents will be used.  So I think it is necessary to interrupt the examination of this witness so that the Defence could be clearly informed of all the documents that will be used with respect to this witness.  I thank you. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution?
MS. MAKWAIA:
Madam President, counsel have been notified of the appearance of this witness for a few days now.  Counsel have had in their possession, from the 14th of November, or thereafter, when we disclosed these documents to CMS.  They should be in a position, Your Honours, to proceed with this witness.  By receipt of the documents in anticipation of this witness's evidence, Your Honour, they are put on notice on what kind of exhibits he shall be tendering. 
MR. HOOPER:
Can I just add, we found the relevant witness; it's at the back of bundle dated November the 19th.  It's the last two pages. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you, Mr. Hooper.  So you received the documents.  It is found in the bundle that was disclosed to you on the 19th of November; is that correct?  Thank you.  

Yes, Mr. Skornicki, do you want to add something? 
MR. SKORNICKI:
Yes, just a few words.  Perhaps I will give the benefit of the doubt regarding disclosure to the Prosecutor, in good faith.  I received -- when I was getting ready to leave Paris for Arusha, I received a bundle of documents on the very day I was leaving.  That was on Saturday, so it is possible that in that bundle of documents there would be the CV of the witness.  I am saying it is possible, and I'm speaking in good faith.  But, however, my team had requested the Court Management Service to make sure that I'm not given -- that my documents are not sent to Paris while I was getting ready to come to Arusha.  Perhaps that is the minor dysfunctioning that perhaps will explain the fact that we have this problem now. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, registry, do you have something to say in this connection?
MS. THOMPSON:
Yes, I would just like to add that all of the documents were served on Defence counsel.  There was a change of plan, like Mr. Skornicki said.  It was up to the Defence counsel to warn us that to send the document to this location as opposed to that location.  Everything was sent to all parties.  That is verified by CMS. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, registry.  

Can you continue, Counsel for the Prosecution? 

MR. MARTEL:
With your leave, please, I'm sorry for interrupting.  I do not want to delay the proceedings before this Chamber.  Judge Pillay had laid down a rule, and I think that that rule was born of wisdom; namely, that the Prosecutor who intends to examine a witness should give at least a list of documents and the list of documents that will be used on the very day of the examination of the witness.  And this was to avoid a situation where the other party is taken by surprise.  

Today, either out of a technical error or some other error, in the situation -- if for example, yesterday we had had the list of documents that would be used today in the examination-in-chief of the witness, we would not face the present difficulties.  And the Defence undertakes to ensure that, in the future, we adopt this rule.  This rule would be very useful.  It is a very wise rule, and it will save the Court's time.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you.  We've already asked the Prosecutor disclose a list of documents, documents that they intend to tender into evidence, that such a list should be given to the registry, and the registry in its turn will disclose the list to the parties concerned.  This will enable us to proceed faster and avoid such incidents.  

So, Counsel for the Prosecution, you may proceed.  Of course, we are going to hear the witness.  

As regards the document you have just tendered, that would be Defence evidence -- perhaps Prosecution evidence, P. 1, Prosecution evidence, P. 1.  That is the CV of Mr. Baghel.  This document is admitted into evidence as Prosecution evidence P. 1. 
(Exhibit No. P. 1 admitted)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may continue with your examination-in-chief, Counsel. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Much obliged, Your Honours.  Just to add that the procedure you've laid out, Your Honour, is indeed what was followed by the Prosecutor on the 14th of November, when these documents were sent to CMS and subsequently dispatched to Defence counsel.  Maybe counsel should read through their documents, Your Honour, before they come and raise issues with you of not receiving any documents.  

I will now proceed with the examination-in-chief of Mr. Baghel. 
MR. MARTEL:
Madam President, I do not accept --

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, we have not given you the floor. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
May I continue, Your Honour? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please, you may continue. 
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, coming back to your employment at the ICTR, have you undertaken investigations in different parts of Rwanda?
A.	Yes.  During the tenure of -- the tenure with IC --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honour, we are sorry to interrupt.  Could the witness observe a pause between the question and his answer, for proper interpretation? 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  During the tenure with ICTR, I have undertaken investigations in different parts of Rwanda, and I have been -- travelled extensively in Rwanda. 
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Could you please tell the Court which parts of Rwanda you have undertaken investigations in?
A.	I have been to Kigali-rural, including Gikomero commune, Kibuye, Butare, Gisenyi, Cyangugu, Ruhengeri, Kibungo, and other places in Rwanda. 
Q.	Now, as part of your duties at the ICTR, have you been assigned to undertake investigations in this case? 
A.	Yes.  I was assigned to undertake the investigation of this case with other colleagues, on the part of the team which is handling this case.
Q.	Did you undertake investigations at the Butare university hospital? 
A.	Yes.  I went there to conduct some parts of investigations.
Q.	Can you please tell the Court when you did this?
A.	In the month of October 2003, I was asked to go to Butare hospital, to make a few photographs, sketches, and other details which are physical details about the hospitals, which I documented.
Q.	And you documented these series of documents, photographs, and footage, as a result of your investigations at Butare university hospital, in a document that is titled, "Maps, sketches, photos and video clippings of Butare university hospital;" is that correct, Mr. Baghel?
A.	Yes, I documented them after visiting Butare.
MR. MARTEL:
Madam President.  Madam President, please.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel? 
MR. MARTEL:
Once more, it is a matter of practice and it is also a matter of rule in this Tribunal:  The Prosecutor should not ask leading questions.  The Prosecutor should only ask questions like,  "What did you do during this investigation?"  And it is up to the witness to give answers.  It is not for the Prosecutor to suggest answers, please. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, can I respond? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Yes.  Of course, you may speak. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, I'm perfectly aware of the practice in common law where in examinations-in-chief you do not lead any suggesting questions or lead questions or put questions that would suggest the answer to the witness.  At this point, Your Honours, I'm trying to expedite the proceedings.  I don't see how counsel can be prejudiced by my giving a leading question to the witness in terms of the title of the document.  And I'm just expediting the process, Your Honours.  I can easily do the "when," "what," "how" questions to the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber is fully aware that leading questions should not be put, but if we have not interrupted Madam Makwaia, it's because it really is not very important.  We have the document where all this is written out, and if there was any risk of confusion, or if we felt that she was asking leading questions that might be prejudicial to the Accused, we would stop her immediately.  

So I think this sort of intervention should be avoided, but we shall also ask Madam Makwaia for -- to put her questions as little suggestively as possible.  If you could try and avoid the stumbling block which is to tell the witness, "So you did this; you did that, didn't you?" then we might go a bit faster, because I know that you are moved by the desire to expedite matters. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
I am obliged, Your Honours.  

Can the witness please be handed this document, Mr. Registrar? 
MR. HOOPER:
May I interrupt?  Sorry, Madam President.  This witness deals with events in Butare that, as I understand it, concerns André Rwamakuba.  I have no objection if this witness is led in respect of the matters contained in this document. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Pray proceed. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
I'm obliged, Your Honours.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, I believe you have before you the document that you have prepared, titled,  "Maps, sketches, photos and video clippings of Butare university hospital."
A.	Yes.  (Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness, your microphone, please. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have the same document before me. 
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Now, looking at this document, I note that you've structured it into three parts, and the first part relates to maps, the second part to sketches and the third part is a photo profile -- is a photo file and video clippings. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Pray proceed.  We were ensuring that the interpreters had at least one copy.  You may continue. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Thank you, Your Honours.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Now, starting with the first part, "Maps," this is from page L0020327 to L0020340, correct, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Yes, it's correct. 
Q.	And in this part, you have included a map of Rwanda and 12 maps of the different préfectures in Rwanda?
A.	Yes, it's so.
Q.	Now, can you tell the Court how many préfectures were in existence in Rwanda in 1994, April through July? 
A.	In 1994, there were 11 préfectures.  I have put here 12.  The twelfth one is Umutara, which was not existing in 1994.  This préfecture was formed later on. 
Q.	And the Umutara préfecture that you have included is found at page L0020340; is that correct, Mr. Witness?
A.	Yes.  This is on the same page.
Q.	Now, can you tell Their Honours what is the source of these maps?
A.	These maps I received from the evidence unit of ICTR, and I learned they received earlier from UNDP office, Kigali.  These are dated April 1998.
Q.	And can you tell Their Honours what is the relevance of these maps forming part of your report?
A.	These maps I have included to show Rwanda country, like how it is located and the countries which are bordering, and how it is divided into various administrative units.  Like, country is divided into the préfectures, which I have shown here 12 préfectures, and the préfectures were again divided into communes.  Communes were divided into secteurs.  

This was the situation in 1994 and continued very recently when Rwanda has been reorganised into province and districts, which has to be taken into account, and now Rwanda is reorganised into province and the districts, and communes and préfectures are not existing, but by and large, boundaries are same, except for few districts and préfectures.
Q.	Now, moving to the second part of your report, headed, "Sketches," starting at page L0020341 to L0020346, have you, Mr. Baghel, included a sketch of the Butare town road map, at page L002342?  Have you located that?
A.	Yes.  I have located.
MS. MAKWAIA:
With your permission, Your Honours, I would like the witness to move to the projector so he can project this sketch on the monitor. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may do so.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, can you tell the Court, please, who drew this sketch?
A.	This sketch I prepared, and before this, I took a map of Butare, which is on the next page, and I photocopied by zooming it so that the main road in Butare can be more clear.  Again, going to this map, this road which I am just passing, this is the main road.  This comes from Kigali or Gitarama and passes through the town and goes to Bujumbura.  This is asphalted road.  The other roads which I have shown, they go to different parts of Rwanda.  Like, this road goes to Gikomero.  These are interior roads in the town.
Q.	Mr. Baghel, looking at the sketch, you have identified certain locations by numbers, starting No. 1 to 7.  Can you please tell the Court what that means? 
A.	In this map, I have placed a few locations which have been identified by a cross, like this, then few things have been as put 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7; these are the roadblocks which were there in 1994.  In fact, these roadblocks, I did research in the evidence unit of our investigation, and I got this information about the roadblocks from a document which I have put in a source, evidence unit document K0194761. 
Q.	These -- sorry.  These roadblocks that you have identified as numbers 1 to 7 were placed on the Butare main road according to the sources that you used in 1994; is that correct, Mr. Witness?
A.	Yes, that's correct.  As I have mentioned here, roadblock No. 1 to 6 were placed on the main road, roadblock 7 and 8 on the other roads which are branching off from the main road.  Information about that I have put in the right -- sorry, left corner of the page.
Q.	On the sketch showing the Butare town road map, you have also indicated certain locations, alphabetically, and what are these places, taking location identified as UH, for example?  Can you please indicate that on the sketch?
A.	I have located -- I have located a few important locations.  Among them, like, UH is the university hospital, and UM, which is up -- this is - which is written here UM, faculty of medicine, and E is the ESO military camp.  Then this is P, which is on near a junction of small roads, the préfecture office.  Similarly, if we go to other places like H1, H2, they are quarters; U2 is the university library; C is the commune office; M is the national museum.  So this way important locations in Butare town have been indicated on this road map. 
Q.	Now, did you do a physical verification of the ten places you have marked alphabetically on the road, Mr. Witness, when you undertook your investigations in Butare?
A.	Yes, I have verified them physically, about the locations of these places, and as this sketch is taken from original map of Butare, so this is edge for the scale where one centimetre is approximately 0.25 kilometres, that is 250 metres, so the relevant locations can be placed how far they are from one place to other places. 
Q.	Now, if you turn to the next page, at LL0020343 -- and please put that on the monitor -- you've just told the Court that, using this map, you have identified the main road in Butare that you've sketched in the previous page.  Now, using a highlighter, can you please indicate the main road in Butare on this map at page L0020343? 
A.	This map, if I put another map on the same thing where I highlight it there, like this is from this side of Kigali, so this coming road is coming from Kigali, then this is the road which I consider the main road which is asphalted and goes to Bujumbura.  And this is the portion only which is highlighted with red highlighter used in the previous sketch which I have shown.  And other places I have placed accordingly.
Q.	On this map, can you please pinpoint the Butare university hospital? 
A.	On this map, if you come from Kigali -- coming from Kigali, then leaving this road, going straight on this, as I'm following, coming this way up and here is the Butare university hospital.
THE COURT REPORTER:
Excuse me, Your Honour, I cannot hear. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, I think the court reporters are having a bit of difficulty in following.  Could a technician please come and investigate the problem?

Please try -- the court stenographers on my right, in English.
THE WITNESS:
On this map, the road portion which has been taken has been highlighted with pink-colour highlighters which I used first again.  So this one is the main road, which goes from Kigali and goes to Bujumbura.  On this map, Butare university hospital is the place where I put this cross.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Can you tell Their Honours what is the source of this map at page L0020343? 
A.	This map is existing in our evidence unit, and I mentioned the difference of the map on the previous pause -- on the previous page, on plans No. 2 Butare, Z-723, of the scale of 1 (indiscernible) 50,000 map.  So this is the source, but this map has been zoomed up by 200 per cent so that the road can be seen in a better perspective. 
Q.	Mr. Baghel, I note that you have a separate sheet of the map which is highlighted, indicating the town road and the Butare university hospital.  Could you please do that highlighting on the document that you've been handed to by the registry?  Because that is the document that will ultimately be tendered as an exhibit.
A.	Okay, certainly.  So this is the one which I'm highlighting with pink highlighter.  This is the university hospital; this road coming from Kigali and going to Bujumbura. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could the technician please be of assistance?  Is the technicians' booth following?  We need some assistance in the Trial Chamber.  The microphone should be fastened.  Yes, there is interference when the microphone is moved.  It would help if the technician could come and put the microphone in the microphone stand. 

Pray proceed. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	And you've indicated on the map, by using the sign "X" or a cross, that Butare university hospital, correct, Mr. Witness?  Mr. Baghel?  I've just asked you a question.  The cross that you've marked on the map indicates the Butare university hospital?
A.	Yes, it is so.
Q.	Okay.  Now, could you please retake your seat for a minute? 

Mr. Baghel, in the course of your investigations, did you visit the Butare university hospital complex?
A.	Yes, in the course of investigation, for this purpose I visited Butare hospital, between 20 October to 22 October in 2003. 
Q.	And apart from taking photographs, you also prepared a sketch, a layout of the complex, didn't you?
A.	Yes, it's so.
Q.	And this is found at L0020345 of the report. 
A.	Yes, it's on the same page.
Q.	Now, what was the source of your sketch?
A.	When I visited the hospital, I contacted the administration, and the administration assigned one of their officials of the hospital with whom I visited the hospital.  So he was the main source for this sketch.
Q.	Now, to go with your sketch, the layout at page L0020345, you also prepared a legend or a key or an index of the layout at page L0020344.  Is that also correct, Mr. Baghel?
A.	Yes.  It's correct.
Q.	Now, with the Chamber's permission, can you please project this sketch on the monitor and I will ask you a few questions? 

Now -- Mr. Baghel, in the sketch of the Butare university hospital, you have identified 30 buildings, and you've indicated in your report at page L0020345 that all these buildings existed in 1994, apart from building No. 13, is that right?
A.	Yes, that is correct.  That's the information I got from the administration.
Q.	Now, looking at the sketch, can you tell Their Honours how many roads lead into the Butare university hospital?
A.	From Butare town, one can go to hospital --
Q.	You can use the pen to indicate the roads as you speak. 
A.	From Butare, which I've marked this thing from Butare town or from ESO, from here, this road, and this road which goes through building -- between building 30 and 26, and again it leaves the main road which I showed in the previous sketch.  So one can come either from this road, from university laboratory or Butare main road side or from this side.
Q.	So how many roads lead into the Butare university hospital?
A.	There are two roads there, which are asphalted roads, but small parts which are non-asphalted, maybe few of them more.
Q.	Now, speaking of the small -- which you've indicated in the dotted form in your sketch, non-asphalted roads within the Butare university hospital, can you please tell the Court what is the distance between building identified as No. 8, the surgery, and the non-asphalted road that we see on the sketch?
A.	If you see the legend, I have shown dotted roads like this one, these are the parts which are not asphalted, but the vehicles can pass through all the time.  Like one of them is here, other one I can show which is going near building 29; one I can show which is going near building number 12, which is maternity.  So from this road, to building No. 8, it can -- it may be around 50 metres, because this sketch is by scale, approximately one centimetre equal to ten metres, so this distance is around five centimetres, so this should be around 50 metres.
Q.	And from the open space at the centre -- no, I'll rephrase that.  From the centre of the open space to the surgery building, that's No. 8, what would be the distance?
A.	From this open space which is surrounded by building 9, 26, 24 and 8, the centre of this open space, from the building 8, which is surgery building, may be around 30 metres.
Q.	And how do you arrive at that number?
A.	Because if we measure it, it's around three centimetres from here, from the centre, to building 8, and this is scale edge for this scale, so three centimetres will be equal to around 30 metres.
Q.	Mr. Baghel, before I ask you to sit down, how do you relate this sketch to the case at hand?
A.	During the investigation -- during the investigation, I found some of the witnesses, they referred a few buildings in the hospital.  The buildings which they referred was surgery, which is building No. 8, or hospitalisation ward, maternity ward, building No. 12; No. 30, faculty of medicine, and few more buildings.  That's why I built this sketch, to show that how far the buildings are located and where the open spaces are there, and how those buildings can be accessed from different directions. 
Q.	You have also noted on your sketch an area identified as a mass grave.  How did you come into this information? 
A.	About this mass grave, I got the information from the same source, from the administration, the official of the administration, and he told me that there was a mass grave there, some bodies, some skulls were found, and this detail I have given in my reference note also, which is on the next page, para 7.
MS MAKWAIA:
And this is found at page L0020346, Your Honours.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Baghel, you may retake your seat again. 

Mr. Baghel, did you also take photographs of different parts of the complex in the course of your investigation?
A.	Yes, I took photographs of different parts of the complex during my -- this visit.
Q.	And these photographs are found at page L0020349 to page L0020356.  Can you confirm that for us?
A.	Yes, I confirm that.
Q.	How many photographs did you take, or how many photographs did you include in this document?
A.	I've included 16 photographs in this document, which have been entered in the log sheet also.
Q.	And this log sheet is found at page L0020348 of your report?
A.	Yes, this log sheet on this page, and it contains photograph number, brief description and the date when I took them.
Q.	Does it also give information of the kind of equipment you used, and film?
A.	Yes.  This gives about the photo camera which I have used.
Q.	Can you tell Their Honours when you took these photographs?
A.	As indicated in the log sheet, I took these photographs on 21st October 2003.
Q.	These photographs, Mr. Baghel, some of these photographs correspond to some of the buildings in your sketch; is that right? 
A.	Yes.  That's so.
Q.	For example, if we look at photograph No. 14, what is this photograph, Mr. Witness? 
A.	The photograph -- the photograph No. 14 is about the place where supposed to be mass grave was there.  There is the open area, which is shown near the electric pole.
Q.	And this is the area you've marked as a mass grave on the extreme right, bottom part of the page in your sketch at page LL -- L0020345? 
A.	Yes.  That's the same.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, to expedite matters, I will not ask Mr. Baghel to project each and every picture on the monitors.  The pictures have been thoroughly described in the log sheet provided in the document, and they will speak for themselves.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Now, just to sum up, Mr. Baghel, what is the relevance of the photographs that you've selected to the case?
A.	These photographs I have selected to show how the buildings look like, what kind of terrain or topography is there.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Madam President, counsel is on his feet. 
MR. ROACH:
Yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Roach? 
MR. ROACH:
Yes, with respect to the photographs, I know that we all have them, and there has been a request that they not be projected.  However, I should like for not just this occasion alone but for all occasions where we are using sketches and photographs, that we bear in mind that this is a public trial, and when we do not project matters, we don't have them on the video records and the public doesn't see them.  So I would urge that, as far as possible, we keep in mind that the public wants to see what is going on here.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Would you like to respond to that, Counsel for the Prosecution? 
MS. MAKWAIA:
I could have them all projected, Your Honours.  And I also intend to show certain footage that has been shot at the Butare university hospital, where some of these buildings will also be seen on footage.  I'm perfectly willing to ask Mr. Baghel to project them on the monitor, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber does not deem it necessary that the Prosecutor should project those photographs, but during cross-examination, if you wish to do so, Mr. Roach, you may do so.  
Please proceed, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, in the last part of your report, at page L0020357, you've included a log sheet of video clippings.  Before we see this footage, can you please -- can you please tell the Court who prepared it and who shot it? 
A.	These video clippings, I carried out research in the evidence unit, and I found that a video was made about the hospital in October 2000, and it has been a Prosecution exhibit of a previous ICTR case, Prosecutor v. Pauline Nyiramasuhuko and others, known as Butare case, No. ICTR 98/42-Trial.  So I got a copy of this Prosecution exhibit, and I reviewed, then suggested or requested the evidence unit to give me small clippings, seven clippings, which are of around six minutes.  So here in the series I put all those seven clippings and the full video also which is KV000273.  In my -- this binder, I stand to be corrected because I wrote Exhibit 12 of Muvunyi case, but this is not so, this is Exhibit 12 of Prosecutor v. Pauline Nyiramasuhuko case.
Q.	Mr. Baghel, this correction you're making is found at page L0020347, where you list the footage as coming from the Muvunyi  case, and you've now just made a correction that, in fact, this footage comes from the Pauline Nyiramasuhuko case, known as the Butare case. Now, coming back to the seven clips that you took out of that footage, did you then compile it into a CD-ROM?
A.	Yes.  In the CD-ROM, these seven clippings have been put and the full video coverage is also there.
Q.	And the full video coverage lasts 14 minutes and 16 seconds. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, with your permission, I propose to run the seven clips, they are very short, very focused, and the fuller version is also inclusive in the CD-ROM and all counsels have been served with the CD, and I'm sure they've all had the opportunity to go through it.
MR. HOOPER:
I'm afraid you're wrong about that last matter.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Well, then, could the CMS tell us why counsel -- all counsels have not been served?
MR. HOOPER:
I may have been served, but I have not had time to go through it.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Well, it's beyond my control, Your Honours.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, it's within someone's control over there, if it's not yours. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
In any event, Your Honours, with your permission, can I proceed to show the clips? 
MR. MARTEL:
Madam President? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I believe you've received the document, and receipt was acknowledged. 
MR. MARTEL:
I want to add something.  I would like to know, before we view the video clippings, who the author of those videos is and when the videos were shot. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could Mr. Baghel please respond to the question? 
THE WITNESS:
This video was originally made in the month of October 2000, by a different team of investigators, and it has been Prosecution exhibit in a previous case.  So my source for this video is the list of the Prosecution exhibits tendered before the Chamber in the previous case.  I'm not the author of this video.  I carried out a research and found the relevant video, that's why I took out, and then just to make it short, put few focused and relevant clippings separately.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	In addition to that, Mr. Baghel, did you subsequently become aware that the persons who shot that footage are Mr. Ghandy Shukry and Mr. Jean-Guy Foy, investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor?
MR. MARTEL:
I strongly object to this.  The Prosecutor is putting words in the witness's mouth.  It's not acceptable. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
I will rephrase it, Your Honours.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Mr. Ghandy -- Mr. Baghel --
MR. MARTEL:
Madam President, I also object to the Prosecutor reformulating it.  I object to the screening of this document.  
      
      I haven't finished what I was saying. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, please.  Please, if you speak both at the same time, we cannot follow you. 
MR. MARTEL:
I was speaking and the Prosecutor cut me short, and this is not acceptable.  I don't know the legal tradition from which the Prosecutor hails -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, make your objections without any value judgements. 

MR. MARTEL:
Madam President, I simply object to the screening of this video by this witness who is not the author. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, then.  We've heard what -- we've heard your objection.  

Could the Prosecutor respond to that objection? 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, I've been laying the foundation to move the witness to show the footage before you.  Now, if Mr. Martel deems it impossible for one investigator to use the work of another investigative team in the Office of the Prosecutor, I don't know what his basis is.  Mr. Baghel has stated he's been to the Butare university complex.  Mr. Baghel has stated he's taken photographs of the complex.  Mr. Baghel is in a position, Your Honours, to introduce this footage into the record. 
MR. MARTEL:
Madam President, with your permission?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very briefly, Counsel. 
MR. MARTEL:
The Prosecutor has not answered -- has just answered the question.  She doesn't understand what she's talking about.  When evidence is tendered, the evidence should be tendered by the person who collected the evidence.  It is a basic rule of evidence. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
I'd like to respond to that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The objection is overruled.  We consider that the document is from the OTP, and the Prosecutor is free to tender this document in evidence, because it is an extract of a document prepared by other OTP investigators. 

Please, Mrs. Makwaia, proceed. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Thank you, Your Honours.  Mr. Baghel has made a summary of the document.  He will still give evidence to the footage as we see it.  I would like to distribute it to the parties and Your Honours.  Unfortunately, it's in English. 

Mr. Jean-Yves, can you please run the first clipping for us? 
(Videotape played)
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, the footage that is currently being screened shows a road.  Which road is this?
A.	(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could the witness speak into his microphone, please? 
THE WITNESS:
It is on the approach road to Butare university hospital from ESO, ESO military campsite, which is less than half a kilometre from this hospital which you see on the screen now.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	And what is this building we are seeing at the moment?
A.	This building is the administrative block of the hospital, first building. 
Q.	And you've marked this clipping in your report at page L0020357 as the entrance to the hospital; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can we please go to the second clipping? 
A.	Again, it shows the front of the hospital, administrative and the reception, and the right side road or path, it leads to cafeteria building.  The road goes from here where there is a small pole.
Q.	Who is this person we are seeing in the footage?
A.	I can identify him.  He's one of our colleague investigators, Mr. Jean-Guy Foy.
Q.	And you've marked this footage as the front of the hospital in your report?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can we please proceed to the third clipping? 
A.	This clipping shows a corridor.  This is the corridor passing between the reception and the administrative block, and it leads to many buildings.  This is the same corridor which is coming.  There is an open area --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
A moment, please.  

Mr. Hooper.  Mr. Hooper, please? 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry to interrupt.  There has been a distribution of a document which is a summary of clippings here, which I think everyone's got except us, which is unfortunate because I think it concerns us most of all.  So could we please be provided with a copy? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Certainly, you will be given a copy. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, I gave excessive copies.  My understanding is that the Accused have also been served.  Can, please, a copy be given to counsel? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper has received a copy.  

You can continue, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
I'm obliged, Madam President.

Can you please retake this clipping, Mr. Jean-Yves? 
THE WITNESS:
This clipping shows a corridor passing between the reception and the administrative block and it leads to many buildings of the hospital, like surgery, paediatrics and maternity.  This is the corridor which is going through, and this is open area which is of the size of around 60 by 60 metre and it's surrounded by surgery, paediatrics and other buildings.  There are some trees also there in this open area.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	In relation to the sketch, where would Mr. Jean-Guy Foy be standing, Mr. Baghel?
A.	He is standing in the open area.
Q.	Between which buildings?  You can just name the buildings, not the numbers. 
A.	He is standing like in front of building 6, or 24, near the place where two or three trees have been shown, and in fact there is a path on the other side which leads to this open area from the main parking area of the hospital, on which vehicles can come through.  This is shown towards building No.  26 also.
Q.	Which is what building?
A.	Building No. 26 is the consultation intensive care. 
Q.	You've marked this clipping as the open area between the surgery, paediatrics and other buildings at page L0020357 of your report?
A.	Yes, that's so.
Q.	Can you please screen the next clipping, please? 
A.	This is again the same open area, and the corridor which passes in front of the surgery building, No. 8 building, and that corridor goes to maternity and other hospitalisation wards.  This is the open area which is surrounded by building No. 6, 7 and 8.
Q.	What is that yellow building?
A.	This is building No. 7.  There is a Red Cross building.
Q.	And you've marked this clip as "other buildings" in your report?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Would you like to add a more identifying detail to it?
A.	In this clip, the area which is in my sketch, area between building 6, 7 and 8 is shown, and the small corridor, like veranda, is shown, which goes by the side of 6 and goes behind to building No. 20, 21.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Baghel.  Can we be shown the next clip, please? 
A.	This is the veranda-like corridor which I was talking, which goes by the side of building 6 to the laundry buildings and other nearby buildings.
Q.	So this bluish building that we are seeing right now, what is that?
A.	This is the laundry building in the hospital.
Q.	And you've also marked this clip as "other buildings" in your report?
A.	Yes, it's so.
Q.	Can we please go to the final clip?  What is this, Mr. Baghel?
A.	It shows the -- again, same veranda, like corridor on the side of building 6.  This shows the road leading to cafeteria, and from the road leading to cafeteria, maybe around 30 metres from the road, my colleague is pointing towards the place where mass grave was supposed to be there.
Q.	And he's pointing towards an electric pole; is that it?
A.	Yeah, the area near the electric pole.
MS. MAKWAIA:
At this stage, Your Honours, I would like to enter the report titled, "Maps, sketches, photos and video clippings of Butare university hospital," starting at page -- cover page L0020325 to L0020357, as Prosecution Exhibit 2. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is there any objection to the admission of the document?  No, apparently. 

Well, the document entitled,  "Maps, clippings," -- "Maps, sketches, photos and video clippings of Butare university hospital" is admitted as Prosecution Exhibit No. 2. 
(Exhibit No. P. 2 admitted).
MS. MAKWAIA:
I would also like to tender, Your Honours, the video clippings, the CD-ROM of the video clippings as -- the video clippings and the summary I've just handed out, as Prosecution Exhibit 2A, and the title should be, "Video clippings, Butare university hospital, KV00-0273," Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is there any objection to the admission of this document?  No?  

Mr. Weyl? 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, with your leave, it seems to me that the summary that was given to us earlier on is a subjective analysis.  It cannot be admitted into evidence.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, I --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution?  May you respond to that? 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, I beg to differ.  This is the statement of this witness.  Mr. Baghel is the author of this summary, and if counsel wants, he can read it on to the record. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl? 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, I'm happy to learn through the answer of my colleague that it is Mr. Baghel who is the author of this summary.  That was given to us by the Office of the Prosecutor.  I discover that this summary has been -- is authored by Mr. Baghel. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So have you withdrawn your objection? 
MR. WEYL:
If Mr. Baghel acknowledges that it is his summary, I will not object, but on condition that he acknowledges that it is his document.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Baghel, are you the one who prepared this document?  Are you the author of this document? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I'm the one who prepared --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please, Mr. Baghel's microphone. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I am the one who prepared.  It is the same thing which I narrated while viewing the clippings. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We thank you, Mr. Baghel. 
MR. MARTEL:
Madam President? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel? 
MR. MARTEL:
The only question I'm asking myself is that the gentleman is showing us a place in the video where we are told that the mass grave is located.  I have a problem in that regard, because where is the evidence of the mass grave?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That could be the subject of a cross-examination, Counsel. 

So we admit this document as Prosecution evidence No. P. 2A, that is the video extracts, and the summary that is attached to the document. 
(Exhibit No. P. 2A admitted)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Makwaia, you may continue.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, were you also assigned to do investigations for this case in another préfecture apart from Butare? 
A.	Yes.  I was assigned to do some parts of investigation in other préfectures also, like in Kigali-rural, and Gikomero commune.
Q.	So you did investigations also in Gikomero commune in the Kigali-rural préfecture.  When did you do this?
MR. MARTEL:
Once more, leading questions, Madam President.  This question is not very important, but I do not agree to this system, and at the beginning of the trial, I must object to this manner of proceeding, because even with regard to more important questions, the Prosecutor may continue in the same manner.  She should only ask objective questions to the witness. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honour, can I please respond to that? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Makwaia, you may respond to the objection.
MS. MAKWAIA:
If counsel was listening carefully, I asked the witness if he undertook other investigations and the witness said yes, and I said, "Which part?"  And the witness said, "Gikomero commune and Kigali-rural."  I was just paraphrasing his answer to go on with the questions, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Indeed, that is what we noted, so we overrule the objection and we ask Ms. Makwaia to continue.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, can you please tell the Court when you undertook this investigation?
A.	For this purpose, I carried out this investigation on 5th November 2003 and 7th November 2003. 
Q.	Why did you undertake this investigation?
A.	I was asked to take few photographs and sketches of the relevant places in Gikomero commune.  For that purpose, I went to the commune and took few photographs, made sketches, took relevant details, but this commune I've been earlier also in relation to this case and other cases also.
Q.	How many times had you been to Gikomero commune prior to your visit of the 5th to the 7th of November 2003?
A.	To this commune, I have been on several occasions, after joining ICTR, but I don't remember exactly how many times, but occasions maybe more than 15 to 20.
Q.	And as a result of your investigations of the 5th to the 7th of November 2003, did you also prepare a series of documents and photographs of the relevant areas?
A.	Yes.  I prepared -- and I made them in a binder, which is here.
Q.	And this document is what is titled,  "Map of Gikomero, sketches of Ndatemwa and Gikomero centres and photos"?
A.	Yes, it's so.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Can the registrar please hand the witness the document? 
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	I believe you now have before you, the document, "Map of Gikomero, sketches of Ndatemwa and Gikomero centres and photos," Mr. Baghel?
A.	Yes, I have.
Q.	Now, you have structured this report into four parts.  I would like to draw your attention to part 2, headed,  "Map of Gikomero relevant areas."  Have you located that?
A.	Yes, I've located it.
MS. MAKWAIA:	
And this is found, Your Honours, at page KO276228.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Now, Mr. Baghel, can you tell Their Honours what is the source of this map?
A.	This extract of a map has been taken from a larger map of Kigali region titled as region the Kigali map of the scale 1 to 50,000, series Z-723.  I photocopied the relevant area of the map.  Then I marked various roads, main roads, which goes to these areas.  These roads are not exhaustive as all the roads but the roads which I have taken during my visits to Gikomero area.  I marked a few roads of Kigali also and few important locations in Kigali, numbered from 1 to 14, and then other locations outside Kigali town which are marked as alphabetical A to C -- A, B, C, up to J, K, L.  And these have been put in the previous list of reference to map of Gikomero what are these, like 1, 2, 3, up to 14, and A to Q. 
Q.	Now, you've told Their Honours you've marked the map with the main roads leading to Gikomero.  How many roads are these that you were able to identify?
A.	Gikomero was a commune in Kigali-rural préfecture, and to these areas which are the relevant areas, I marked the roads which leads from three sites, like if you go through on the -- this map, the line which are solid lines indicate the roads which are asphalted.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Excuse me, Your Honours, at this point I would ask Mr. Baghel to project the map on the monitor so it would be easier to follow what he's indicating to us. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can the technicians kindly help us by projecting the map on the monitor, on the screen?  

We thank you.  

You may continue, Counsel.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	You were indicating to us the main roads that you've mapped out on this map.  Can you please continue, Mr. Baghel? 
A.	(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. Baghel's microphone, please. 
THE WITNESS:
This map, as I told just now, this is the Kigali town, where different locations I have marked as numbers --
MS. MAKWAIA:
The map is not being screened, Your Honours.  Can the technicians rectify it? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It's fine now.  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
This is the Kigali town, where different locations are marked from 1 --
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Sorry, Mr. Baghel, is there a better way of positioning the map, turn it around?  Can you right it and then can you zoom it a bit? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is still not clear enough.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Can you open it up, Mr. Baghel?  Maybe that would be better.  One page at a -- just -- no, it gets worse.  Thank you, that's better. 
A.	So I was pointing out, this is Kigali town, and in Kigali town, a few locations I have marked, numbering from 1 to 13, 14.  In the north, is the Gikomero area, and Gikomero is a commune in Kigali-rural préfecture.  So this road out of Kigali town, which I am pointing out, going to Byumba, this asphalted road.  Then again, the road from Kigali town, taking a turn and going to this side, which I am pointing to Q goes to Rwamagana and further to Kibungo.  So the area which is Gikomero area can be accessed from these two asphalted roads.  

One direct road to this area can be found from Kigali directly, again non-asphalted road which goes between point 13, 14, and again goes down into the area.  So I've been taking these roads mainly.  From a road which goes to Byumba, an asphalted road, again we took a road on the right side towards the east to go to Gikomero commune or few places in Gikomero area.  From the road which goes from Rwamagana,  we have to take non-asphalted roads to north to go to the area.  So this area can be accessed from two sides of the roads, one is this one, other one is this one, and directly also from Kigali town there.  So these are the main roads which I have pointed out, out of Kigali, which may go to this area, non-asphalted, which goes from number 8, 13, 14, A, B, D and further then.  

Second road can lead to this area coming from 9, 10, on asphalted road, branching off and going non-asphalted road, M, N, F, and again different areas.  Or further we go near Q, again, branch off on non-asphalted road, go P, F, this way.  From Byumba road side, also there are two entries can be made on non-asphalted road from L and one is from K.  

So these are the main roads, but there may be some small roads also, which may branch off at seven locations, again join the main road at different locations. 
Q.	And you've given further details of the various roads or routes that can be used to reach Gikomero at page K0276226, headed, "Observations/relevant information, map of Gikomero."  Is that right, Mr. Witness?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And for the numbers that you -- can you go back to the map, please?  And for numbers 1 to 14, used as references for the map, you've given a key or an index at page K0276227, and you've termed these as "landmark areas in Kigali".  Is that correct, Mr. Baghel?
A.	Yes, it's correct.
Q.	On the same page, you've also given the index to the alphabets, A to Q that you referred to on this map, giving the different names of the areas that you marked A - Q?
A.	Yes, that's correct.
Q.	For example, if we take area you've identified as C on the map, can you locate that, Mr. -- actually, I'm going to rephrase that.  Looking at the map, Mr. Baghel, I see the area you've identified as C and G are both named Gikomero.  Can you please give an explanation to that?
A.	Yeah.  Just for the record, Gikomero is a commune in Kigali préfecture, so the place identified at C, this is the place where Gikomero commune office is located.  In Gikomero commune, there is a Gikomero secteur.  Commune is divided into secteurs in Rwanda, so there is a Gikomero secteur also, and name is same, Gikomero secteur.  So at the place G, Gikomero secteur office is located.  So these two locations are different places and they identify different entities, so Gikomero commune is the larger entity which is a larger entity whole commune but secteur is a small entity around G which was Gikomero secteur. 
Q.	Now, if one were to leave Kigali town to go to the Gikomero commune office, how long would that take by car, Mr. Baghel?
A.	From Kigali town, Gikomero commune office is around -- it's - again, I marked on a separate page.
Q.	And this you've marked at page K0276229; is that correct?
A.	Yes, where I put Kigali-Remera point 13 to commune offices, around 17 kilometres, and one can reach in 45 minutes by taking this road.  But this place can be accessed from different roads also.
Q.	And how did you arrive at the different times that you've indicated at page K0276229, the different -- how did you arrive at the measurement of the distances of the different locations you've marked on this page?
A.	These distances I measured through the vehicle, by driving a vehicle, and noting down the mileage, and time taken is also at that time.  So these are approximately the same time, time and distances, which are there.  And I've been to this area so many times so I've found that it's almost the same. 
Q.	Okay.  Now, can you please screen the map again, map of Gikomero relevant areas?  Do you also --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How much longer do you think this will take, Counsel? 
MS. MAKWAIA:
About 15, 10 minutes, Madam President. 
MR. MARTEL:
Madam President, with your permission? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel. 
MR. MARTEL:
I think you're wondering the same thing that I'm wondering, which is what is the pertinence or relevance of all this. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Makwaia, can you finish in ten minutes, you think?  Okay.  Then it's better you finish first and then we will make our short adjournment.
MS. MAKWAIA:
I'm obliged, Your Honours.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Now, Mr. Baghel, using the map of Gikomero relevant areas, can you please indicate, according to your understanding, which were the areas that were in government control between April 7th and 17th, 1999 -- 1994?
A.	My understanding is that --
MR. HOOPER:
Excuse me, I object to this question.  I've had no notice of it.  I've had no statement relating to it.  It's a matter which I think is going to require argument.  We are going to require -- at least I do -- a brief break this morning.  I'm wondering, if we were able to take it now, perhaps I can discuss with my friend over the adjournment quite where we are going with this question, and on this subject. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Makwaia, would you like to respond to that objection? 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Yes, Your Honours.  The Prosecutor has got the burden of proof, to prove the charges against the Accused.  We are anticipating all sorts of defence.  The Defence of Rwamakuba has not served us with any notice of alibi, but in anticipation of any defences, Your Honours, this is an appropriate question to lay the foundation for future evidence that will be heard before your Court. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Hooper? 
MR. HOOPER:
Notice of that alibi was given in open court in 2000 and, in fact, involved questions from the Judges on the issue.  The Prosecution case here against Rwamakuba, the relevance of it, perhaps it wasn't in my friend's opening.  I draw away from dealing with it now myself.  I may deal with it in cross-examination, but what concerns me here is that Mr. Upendra, with all due respect, is a gentleman, as I understand it, who has come fairly recently to his duties, relatively recently; I think 2000 was when he told us he was here, first here, and involved in any way with these cases, and there is now being put, as I understand it, because I was momentarily distracted and half listening to the question, but I was alerted to what I understood was the thrust of the question and it was this:  that this witness was about to embark on a relatively, perhaps, detailed exposition of troop movements in 1994.  There has been no ground laid in respect to that.  His knowledge must be secondary or tertiary, or even further removed than that.  And it is a significant and important issue, and perhaps I can just indicate what that issue is.  It hasn't been opened.  The Prosecution case in respect of Gikomero has not been opened.  None of us have been particularly assisted in that respect, but what I understand it to be is this:  On the 12th of April, André Rwamakuba is alleged to have gone to Gikomero centre at around mid-day and incited the people there to start killing.  That is not in fact accepted, and two issues -- one issue rises.  One issue is:  Where is he?  The Prosecution also put him, as I understand it, in the government convoy heading out of Kigali to Gitarama when the interim government moved to Gitarama, as we heard in the opening yesterday, on the 12th of April.  Issues then arise as to what was going on in Gikomero and what the access was to this particular area.  And the Defence will maintain that, in fact, Gikomero, which comprises essentially a high massif to the north of Kigali, was effectively cut off by the movement of RPF troops.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Is counsel giving evidence, Your Honours? 
MR. HOOPER:
That's the relevance of the matter.  I point that out for the assistance of the Court.  It's that issue which you, the Judges, are going to be concerned with to some -- to a great extent over the next many months, and I think the sooner these issues are in fact clarified, the better.  So I am, in fact, most concerned that with a sideswipe, a side question in this way, this particular witness, who is being produced as an investigator to produce maps, is now being relied upon to provide, as I understand it, opinion evidence or, in fact, direct evidence on the positions of troops in 1994.  There has been no ground laid for that, and I challenge his authority and ability, in fact, to reliably and helpfully produce that evidence before the Court.  

If it was the Prosecution's intention to use this witness in this way, then in my submission, it wasn't just a matter of courtesy but an essential requirement to provide those of us on this side of the bar with notice, with the basis upon which that question was going to be founded.  So there are important issues here.  There is an objection to what I understand, and it may be I've misunderstood where my friend is going, but if my understanding is right, it's, in my submission, with knowing no more about this witness's abilities, to question his authority to answer these questions. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel. 

The objection is sustained, Counsel Makwaia, if you don't mind going on to something else, but do you think you can finish in the next five minutes?  Because we must take our break.
MS. MAKWAIA:
I'll be able to finish with the next photographs that follow.  Just before I proceed, Your Honours --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Very well, then, pray proceed. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Could counsel please file his notice of alibi pursuant to Rule 67, proviso A?  The conditions are stipulated in that Rule, Your Honours. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, this raises another issue, and I don't know whether you want to deal with it at this stage and before the adjournment.  I know what my friend has said.  I appreciate the requirements.  

Certainly, in my jurisdiction, and it may be as a matter of common sense and practice, alibi is the defence of stating that you are elsewhere, which is, of course, what "alibi" in Latin means, "elsewhere, another place."  To be in another place, you have to be in a particular place on the allegation at a particular time, and if the Prosecution want to tell me what time André Rwamakuba is meant to be in Gikomero secteur, then I can respond to that.  

So if the Prosecution -- and it was admitted from their opening yesterday -- provide me with the allegation concerning Rwamakuba, the time and place when he's committing the offence in Gikomero secteur, I will respond to that appropriately. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
I would just like to direct counsel's attention, with your permission, Your Honours, to the Prosecutor's supplementary pre-trial brief on this matter.  He will find there the necessary information.  Thank you.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, perhaps you can pay us all the courtesy, because the Judges, I'm sure, are keen, as I am, to hear the response.  You can provide us all perhaps with the details of what is alleged against 
André Rwamakuba. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
May I proceed with the examination-in-chief, Madam President? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, I'd said that you could continue.  You raised a problem of the question of notice of alibi, but do pray proceed.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, you can re-take your seat. 
A.	Thank you.
Q.	During the course of your investigations, did you also take photographs of the relevant areas in Gikomero, Mr. Baghel?
A.	Yes, I took a few relevant photographs, which have been put in the binder.
Q.	And the methodology you used to take these photographs is similar to that you used for the photographs for the Butare university hospital?
A.	Yes.  More or less, it is the similar methodology which I did.
Q.	Now, from pages K0276232 to K0276242, you have the log sheet of the photographs and the photographs themselves in the report; is that also correct?
A.	Yes.  It's correct.
Q.	And the log sheet at page K0276233 -- I'll rephrase that.  Can you please tell Their Honours what the log sheet at page K0276233 contains?
A.	The log sheet on this page K0276233 contains the photo number, date on which these photos were taken, the location where these photos were taken and a brief description.  It also contains the type of camera used and the negatives.
Q.	And photos No. 1 to 6 are all in the Ndatemwa centre, and 7 to 15 of the Gikomero centre?
A.	Yes.  It is so.
Q.	And in these photographs, Mr. Witness, you've included different areas.  For example, can you please go to photograph number 5 and 6?  Why did you include these photographs?
A.	During the investigation, I found that few witnesses will refer these places of interest, so I took these photographs and put them in the binder, like photo 5, we saw is house of Muhire and road to Rutunga, and photo 6 is also showing a house of Muhire.  And in photo 5 and 6, I have retained from A2 to A3.  This would be the difference to the sketch which is on K0276231.  On this sketch these photographs were taken from a place marked A2 and A3. 
Q.	Now, the sketch mark you've just referred to gives the different locations of the areas where you were when you took these photographs. 
A.	Yes.  This is sketch is the physical description of the Ndatemwa centre in Gasabo secteur where few houses, few  shops were there.  And places marked like A1, A2, A3, these places from where I took the photographs, all these are the places which have been referred to -- referring to photos.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, as with the photographs in the Butare university hospital on document Prosecution Exhibit P. 2, I do not intend to ask Mr. Baghel to project them on the monitor.  They are self-evident from the log sheet contained in his report. 

At this point, Your Honours, with your permission, I would like to tender Mr. Baghel's report titled,  "Map of Gikomero, sketches of Ndatemwa and Gikomero centres, and photos," from cover page K0276223 to page K0276242, as Prosecution Exhibit P. 3. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are there any objections on the part of the Defence?  No objections?  Thank you.  The document entitled,  "Map of Gikomero, sketches of Ndatemwa and Gikomero centres, and photographs," from page K0276223 to 42 is tendered and admitted as Prosecution Exhibit P. 3. 
 (Exhibit No. P. 3 admitted)
MS. MAKWAIA:
That concludes the examination-in-chief of Mr. Baghel, Madam President.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very good.  Thank you, Madam.  We will now briefly adjourn.  We will adjourn for a quarter of an hour.  And we will resume for the cross-examination of the witness by the Defence.  Thank you.  

The hearing stands adjourned. 
(Court recessed at 1123H)
	(Pages 1 to 33 by Mark Porter)









(Court resumed at 1146H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is in session.  In principle, the Defence should be able to proceed to cross-examination of Witness Baghel.  I would like to know whether you are ready for the cross-examination or whether there are any motions.  I told you that it is still possible to call Mr. Baghel another day if you need more time to prepare for this cross-examination, but if you are ready to do so now, please proceed.
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you, Madam President. 

Madam President, I understand this witness's position to be that he is generally available, and could therefore return on another day.  But I am quite content to ask him such questions as I have this morning and if, as may well be the case in the future, in the light of testimonies and the like, it's -- it becomes relevant, then perhaps, Madam President, you could consider then a further application to have him recalled, if that's not inconvenient.  So I'm quite content to put my questions this morning. 

CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, can I go back first to your investigation last month in Butare.  In respect of both aspects of your evidence, both in respect of Butare and in respect of Gikomero, you were able to get access to maps.  And if we look at our Butare bundle, at the first map page, 8529, as it's numbered top right -- if you look at our 8529, it may be that in my case, with age, my eyesight is certainly getting worse rather than better, but I do find that map incomprehensible, to be fair; and I am wondering if we would not all be better assisted -- 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Madam President.
MR. HOOPER:
I thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Oui, Madam Makwaia, is there any objection?  
MS. MAKWAIA:
I can't quite - I can't find the number counsel is referring to.  Could he refer to the longer number, our 0020329?  
MR. HOOPER:
Well - 
MS. MAKWAIA:
He may have a number that is marked by the registry. 

MR. HOOPER:
Well, I can, but I understood we've all been -- this has been usefully paginated, and in the top right - left - right-hand corner of mine, and perhaps everyone else's, it reads simply 8429.  So, for easy reference, rather than these eight digit numbers -- 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Well, unfortunately, the OTP is not served with those copies, which are then paginated by the registry.  This is why I have been going by the longer numbers. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, may I suggest you get hold of some, because it seems a pointless exercise to have distributed paginated bundles and not got any yourself. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
I don't think so, Your Honours, because my entire examination-in-chief has been led on the basis of longer numbers.  Now, going back to the shorter numbers paginated by the registry, just won't be convenient. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, again, one tries.  

I am looking, in fact --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Counsel, try to follow what the - the system the Prosecutor has been using; it will be convenient for everyone. 
MR. HOOPER:
Right.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Page ending 328.  It's a simple point.  Can we have a better map, one that we can read?  Would that be possible, sir?  Could you get hold of one for us?

Sorry - yes.  Mr. Baghel, that was a question, I'm sorry.  Could you get hold -- or help us get a better map?
A.	I am sorry, but I could not understand you; that question was intended for me.  

This map I got from evidence unit, and the evidence unit of investigations, they have better maps.  At the moment I have one map, which is not exactly the same, which is a bigger map, and it's a tourist map of Rwanda.  So at the moment I can hand over only that map. 
Q.	All right.  It's just that, with respect, I find that map not helpful, and I'm sure I am not alone.  

Would it be possible also to get a map that shows Gikomero - not Gikomero, that shows Butare in respect of its individual secteurs and cellules?
A.	We have the map here, which is at the page ending 329, Butare map. 
Q.	Could we have one that doesn't strain the eyesight as much as that one?  Would that be possible?
A.	In fact, I don't have such map here, but evidence unit will be able to provide.
Q.	I say that because I anticipate over the next months or so, we're going to be dealing with the -- with the area in detail, and it would help everyone if we could have a map that we could actually use.  So, if you could use your best offices, sir, to perhaps get us a better map.  

In your evidence you said that you did some investigation into roadblocks in the area, and you referred to a source document KO194761, which was obviously the document from which you were able to extract and mark some of the barriers that, I assume, appear on that document.  Would it be possible, sir, for you to produce the source document KO194761 as best evidence, basically, if that is what it is?
A.	Yes.  I have the source document with me and I can produce here.
Q.	Very well.  Then in due course I am sure we can get - we can get copies in respect of that.  

Just so that in the future we're not at cross-purposes, if I can take you to your very helpful sketch of Butare University Hospital at page ending 345.  Can you confirm, sir, that where there are pathways indicated with a dotted line, nearly all those pathways are, in fact, hard, whether that's tarmac or more likely concrete, as we can see in the photographs that are there?
A.	In that sketch, if you go through to page 344, just one before in the page end -- 
Q.	Yes. 
A.	-- where I marked - I marked "roads, tarmac", which is solid line, then I marked "covered/corridors", which is one line and two dots and one line. 
Q.	I see; there is a distinction, yes.
A.	Then there is a road non-tarmac, which is actually a path, which are only dotted lines.
Q.	Well, that clarifies it for me, and thank you very much. 
A.	Further, in these paths, which are non-tarmac, which I shown dotted lines, these are the hard surface, but not asphalted.
Q.	Yes.  And we see those, do we not, in the photographs?
A.	I mean the hard surface, which I can show the photograph numbers.  If you go photograph number 9, this photograph is taken a certain area in front of maternity.  So, if you go to the sketch which is on page 345, maternity building number 12.  Where I have written "open area", I have noted down dotted lines, which means the path comes to number 12 building.  And this photograph is in front of building number 12 on that side, so it's a hard surface, not a marshy land.
Q.	Yes. 
A.	And asphalted road means, like if you see the photograph number 12, which is asphalted road scene, which is concrete, asphalt, little bit black.
Q.	Yes.  Thank you very much.

Now, in respect of the photographs you took, did the hospital authorities put you under any restraint as to what photographs you could or could not take?
A.	Yes, I remember they did not allow us to go inside the buildings, like inside the rooms; but outside, they did not put any restrictions outside the buildings, and one of their officers was with us.
Q.	Right. 
A.	So at that moment I did not visit inside the buildings.
Q.	And the official who was with you was the deputy director; is that right, called François Nyirimihigo?
A.	Yes, that's what I've written. 
Q.	Could you clarify one part of your evidence which I didn't quite understand, and it was that you said that, "During the investigation, I found some of the witnesses."  And  then you referred to surgery, maternity and the faculty of medicine.  Did you mean by that, that you spoke to certain witnesses at the hospital and -- or did you mean by that, that you had had a look at witness statements before you went in order to try and see what would be relevant to photograph in your investigation?
A.	During the investigation I looked at the statements and I saw that these building had been rifled (sic) at that moment on that day.
Q.	Right.  So it wasn't a question of seeking out and speaking to any witnesses at the hospital?
A.	Not that day in this connection specifically.
Q.	Have you, in fact, spoken to witnesses at the hospital?
A.	Yes, I spoke -- some of the witnesses who are working at the hospital and I spoke them outside the hospital, not in the hospital.
Q.	All right.
A.	But not at that moment.
Q.	Can you provide me with the pseudonym of the witnesses you did speak to?
A.	I don't remember the pseudonyms now, but as usual, after investigation we make our investigation report and give to our investigation management.
Q.	All right.  Did you keep a note of what those witnesses said to you?
A.	Yes, we mentioned in our report, and it's part of our report which goes to the investigation management.
Q.	Would it be possible for you to produce a copy of your note of what was said to you and by whom?
A.	No, I can't -- I don't have them.
Q.	Using pseudonyms appropriately, of course.
A.	No, I don't have them.
Q.	But as far as you know, these notes are still in existence, are they?
A.	Yes, they are supposed to be. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, at this point I believe these notes are -- I believe the investigators' notes to the management of our office are protected under Rule 70 and are non-disclosable.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, we may address that at another time.  I don't propose to go into it now. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	How many witnesses did you speak to, sir?
A.	There is a part of investigation, like we do exercise like witness interview, recording of statements or different aspects of investigation.  In this mission, I did some of the part, like reconfirmation of few statements that were done in this mission.
Q.	What is meant by reconfirmation?
A.	Like we press the witnesses again before the trial, and we read them their previous statements and reconfirm their version.
Q.	I am sorry, I didn't quite catch the last phrase.  You give - you show them their statements, and what?
A.	We read the statements again to them, and if they have some changes, then we make a report and make the changes.  If they admit, yes, this is what was told to the investigation last time, then we put in our report there is nothing to change; and the other part of our investigation exercises. 
(Pages 34 to 38 by Judith Baverstock)




















	1200H
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And as part of that investigation exercise, were there any changes made that you can recall, from the witnesses that you spoke to? 
A.	Not substantially, as far as I remember now, but those are the parts of our reports that were sent to the investigation management.
Q.	And when did you engage in these confirmation exercises?  When was it?  Was it last month?
A.	This is like a continuous exercise.  For this purpose, some of the witnesses I did during this mission -- and I went on between 20 October to 22nd afterward, 2003.
Q.	There's been occasions before then when this confirmation exercise has gone on, is there?  Is that the position? 
A.	Excuse me?  Pardon me again? 
Q.	Apart from last month, you've done this before with witnesses at the hospital; is that right?
A.	Before that, I did not do in this case.  In other cases, with different witnesses for the last three and a half years.
Q.	I understand.  So I'm concerned only with witnesses at Butare hospital, and your evidence is, in summary, that you undertook a degree, or some, confirmation exercise with witnesses last month.  Is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Thank you. 
Q.	You produced a video clip that was produced for the Butare case against the witness who I'll call Pauline, and I haven't seen the rest of the CD yet, but can you just help me as to this:  As far as you know, is there sound on that CD?  I've not had the opportunity to look at it.  Do you know, is there sound, because your colleague is speaking; can we hear him on our CDs, do you think?
A.	Yeah, there's sound on the CD.
Q.	Right.  And was your colleague in that CD, in the clip, was he pointing out, as was your evidence, the grave site?  Was he doing that on the video?
A.	Yes, I saw it in the last clipping, which is clipping No. 7, he's pointing out to some direction, near the pole, electric pole.
Q.	Was that relevant to the Pauline case?
A.	I do not know, because that case, I was not involved.
Q.	But that's why that video was made; is that right?
A.	Supposed to be, because it's -- like I found as one of the Prosecution exhibits in one of the case.
Q.	Is the position of that site in fact just outside the hospital area?
A.	Excuse me again? 
Q.	Is the site that we see there, is it in fact just outside the hospital area?
A.	Yeah, that site -- in the hospital premises but outside the hospital buildings, there's a road which I pointed out which goes to cafeteria site and, on the right side of the road, maybe around 25 to 30 metres from that road.
Q.	Yes.  Is that in fact still part of the hospital site or is it another part of the area where there were private houses?
A.	If you see one of my photographs where I have photographed No. 15 on page ending with 356.
Q.	Three five six.  Excuse me; just excuse me one moment.  I'm sorry, I'm trying to catch up with you.  Yes, I have it.
A.	Where I've shown a house, a residence of a hospital staff.  It means -- and the place which is supposed to be the mass grave site, which was supposed to be mass grave site or said to be mass grave site, was in the area before this house.  So there's no boundary mark to the hospital, but it can be called as part of the hospital premises.
Q.	All right.  So as we look at photo 15, this site is between the cameraman and that house in the far distance; is that what you say?
A.	Yeah, beside and between, but that place is not shown, so if you see in the photograph it's on the left side of the cameraman.  That place is not marked.
Q.	Right.  But we can see it, can we, in that field, or whatever?
A.	That site will be the extension of this field.
Q.	So it's not in view of the --
A.	Yes.
Q.	It's not in the photograph?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Do you know if there was an exhumation made there and if any record has been kept of that exhumation and of the findings of that exhumation?
A.	I do not know.
Q.	Can I move now to Gikomero and to the Gikomero sketches and plans?  And again, thank you very much for producing those.  It will be very helpful in this case.  There's a map of Gikomero on page ending 228, map of Gikomero, relevant area.  And, again, I'm afraid my eyesight or this map doesn't much help me.  It's very clear as to your road markings, but the map itself has rather been lost in photocopying; would you agree?
A.	Yes, some of the features might have been lost because the original map is coloured one and the original map contains many features as usual in the maps.
Q.	Well, I've made -- or my team, I should say, have made great efforts to find a map, but we haven't been able to find a map of Gikomero.  Could you possibly produce a copy of this map to us and to the Court?  I notice that this picture or plan, 228, that you've prepared, has been reduced by half.  Would it be possible to provide us with an area of Gikomero and its connections with Kigali in its original state, if necessary, colour photocopied?  Would that be something that could be done?
A.	I took this -- the original copy, original map, which is quite large, it is in the evidence unit of investigation.  I don't have the copy now at the moment.
Q.	I appreciate that.  I don't expect you to act as a magician there in the box, but perhaps you can go back to this particular department and provide a working map that we can all use usefully.  Would you agree to do that?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Thank you very much.  Dealing with Gikomero, would you agree with this:  That even with the benefit of a map and photographs, it's very difficult, isn't it, to appreciate, without going there, the topography and terrain of this area?  It's quite complex and -- would you agree with that?
A.	Yes, I agree.  That's why we are providing maps, photographs, and myself is here to describe.
Q.	Yes.  But even with that assistance, it falls far short of going there and seeing the area; is that not right?
A.	It's always the best.
Q.	To fully appreciate this area will require a visit, will it not?  And perhaps more than one?
A.	Yes.  It's up to the person to decide.
Q.	Of course.  Of course, it is, and the restraints that exist -- but that's true, perhaps of Butare as well, but I've moved on from Butare.  Just dealing now with Gikomero. 

Now, Gikomero, the area that we're concerned with, is a high upland area north of Kigali; is that right?
A.	Yes, it's in the north of Kigali.
Q.	Rising to almost, I think, 1800 metres, almost 6,000 feet, in other languages?  It's a high terrain, standing high above Kigali; is that right?
A.	It's right that hills are there in the area, but measurements of hills, I do not know.  But, yes, that's why, if you see one photograph -- photograph No. 17 on page 242.
Q.	Just let us catch up with that, sir, please.  Just one moment.  Photograph 7 -- 17, yes, thank you. 
A.	View from hill in Gikomero area, Jurwe secteur overlooking Kigali.
Q.	Yes.
A.	So it implies that there are hills in Rwanda and even a view can be taken from a hill in Gikomero area, specifically in Jurwe secteur.
Q.	Yes.  But even looking at that photograph, sir, it doesn't -- even that photograph doesn't quite give the same impression as being there, does it?
A.	Yes, that is so.
Q.	But certainly, you are right, looking at that photograph, that the view from the top of Gikomero hill is a commanding hill, is that right, over the entire city or part of the city of Kigali and the airport?
A.	It cannot be told for all the hills, but, yes, few hills in Gikomero area at higher level, some may be the valleys, so it depends on the location from where a person stands and from where a person looks at Kigali or part of Kigali.
Q.	But if you're standing on the hill there, you have a very commanding position over Kigali; is that right?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Hooper, please observe a short break between the questions and the answers because the interpreters may be having problems with the linking up of questions and answers. 
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President, I am sorry.  I think it takes a bit of breaking in to get us used to that, and I'm sorry, and I will try and give this necessary break.  And I apologise to the interpreters. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So I think you did answer that question. 
A.	For this discussion, I would like to know what is commanding height, because from some hills, yes, Kigali can be seen, which I've shown in some of the photographs, but not from all of the hills, because Gikomero area is quite large.
Q.	Yes, it's a large area, isn't it, very large area; is that right?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, can we just turn to the immediate areas that you were concerned with?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Please, sir, observe the break.  The interpreters are having some problems.
MR. HOOPER:
All right.  I'll let you tie a piece of string to me, and you can tug it when you -- I'll try and remember that. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can we go to map 228?  The bottom section shows us the area of Kigali city; is that right?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And you've explained that the dark lines represent tarmacadam road; is that correct?
A.	Yes, dotted lines represent the roads which are not tarmacked, non-asphalted roads.
Q.	And you have provided in this booklet some helpful indications, at page 229, of routes and distances and times on those several routes.  And can I go to those routes, please, and can we deal with them so that we have them clearly in mind?  

Can I start, looking at your page 229 and referring back to the map of Gikomero to route 1?  I'll call it route 1.  From the Nyabigugu bus stand up to -- and if we look at the plan, I see you've said route via L, but in fact, it's route via K, is it not, it's up to K, via L?
A.	Yes, it's up to K.
Q.	Right.  So we can perhaps mark that in our -- we can mark that in our route via -- that it's L going to K, and this bit stops.  So you're measuring just the tarmac road out of Kigali to point K; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that's correct.
Q.	And it's 25 kilometres, taking 25 minutes; is that correct?
A.	Yes, approximately so.
Q.	So you're doing a steady 60 kilometres an hour in your vehicle, about?
A.	Yes.  It can be driven at higher speed also.
Q.	Yes.  And then we have, in the next box down, the continuation of that journey, because it takes you eventually to the Ndatemwa centre, which we can see is a little along the dotted line at J; is that right?
A.	Yes, that's correct.
Q.	And that you've slowed down, you've measured it, and it reads five kilometres, 15 minutes.  You've slowed down to just 20 kilometres an hour.  That's right?
A.	The speeds cannot be fixed.  It depends on the road condition, the kind of bridges, the kind of tonnes, if the road is hilly now, and this is not an asphalted road.  So it's a total time taken, around 15 minutes.
Q.	Yes.  That little bit of road, the five kilometres?
A.	Yes, five kilometres.
Q.	It's a bad road, isn't it?
A.	It's a bad road, but vehicles can be driven, and I have driven the vehicle.
Q.	You went up there, did you -- what, in your saloon car? 
A.	No, we used four-by-four Nissan cars.
Q.	Have you ever been up there in a saloon car?
A.	No.
Q.	You wouldn't try it, would you?
A.	I have not tried it.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Slow down a bit, Counsel
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	You wouldn't attempt to do it in a saloon car, would you?
A.	I've not done it, and I don't intend to do it.  It's not my personal visit.
Q.	You were driving what, a United Nations-provided four-by-four vehicle, a jeep or something like that?
A.	On that visit or on other official missions when we carry out, we go by the vehicle provided by ICTR, which are four-by-four cars.
Q.	Right.  And once you turn off the asphalt road at K, or indeed anywhere where you turn off to make the ascent up to the plateau of Gikomero, it is a steep climb, is it not?
A.	It depends, because it's a hilly road, so somewhere may be steep climb for a few metres.  It may be again going down or going straight.  So it's the roads and the hills as usual.  The roads are in the hills, so it's a hilly road.
Q.	Yes, all right.  Once you get up to the top on the plateau, the roads are quite good, aren't they?
A.	The roads which can be seen in many photographs, the roads like if you see photo 1, photo 2, the Ndatemwa centre.  These are the roads which can be seen in photos, photo 3, photo 4, but these are the things where it is a plain area.
Q.	You have no photo of a hilly climb of road, have you?
A.	In this binder, there is no such photo.
Q.	No.  Returning to the route, sir, route 1 to Ndatemwa, can I refer to that as going on to Gikomero through the back door, as it were?  Would that be fair?
A.	"Through the back door" means what? 
Q.	Well, you go all the way round to the back of the massif and then ascend the hill there, that's the position, as opposed to other routes where you ascend mainly from the front of the massif in relation to Kigali.
A.	No.  It's up to the person.  If you want to take a start in point 3 at Kigali, he will take that route.  If somebody wants to have -- go from point No. 9 or 10 in Kigali, or No. 7, he may take a different route.
Q.	Right. 
Q.	Now, that takes you to the Ntembwa centre, and when you got there, again, sir, can you just clarify for me what you meant when you said you spoke to -- or you had some witnesses?  Would I be right in saying that, as was the case in your answer in the Butare matter a moment ago, by that you mean you'd looked at some witness statements so that you could better identify points of relevance?  Was that the position?
A.	Yes.  I went through the witness statements.  Then I tried to locate those places. 
Q.	As to witnesses on Gikomero, have you been a party to investigations of witnesses on Gikomero concerning events at Gikomero?  By that, I mean Gikomero commune rather than secteur, the area generally. 
A.	Yes.  During the last three and a half years, as I told in my examination-in-chief, that I've been involved in many years in Gikomero also, I carried out some parts of some investigations on few cases.
Q.	Do you know how many witnesses you've spoken to?
A.	In which period? 
Q.	The entire period.  I know it may be a difficult question, but generally?
A.	From which area only beginning --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, please slow down a bit, sir.
MR. HOOPER:
I'll ask the question again.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	During your period of investigations concerning Gikomero, how many witnesses concerning Gikomero have you spoken to?
A.	In my -- in my tenure with ICTR in last three and a half years, I might have spoken to maybe more than 20 persons, like 20 witnesses from Gikomero.
Q.	Very well.  Now, going back to the route, you go from then Ndatemwa and you drive up to point G, Gikomero secteur office, which is particularly relevant to this case.  Gikomero secteur -- you provided photographs -- is a little place in the back of beyond.  Would you agree?
A.	If you go through the page marked last digit 231, there I put a sketch of Gikomero centre.
Q.	Would you agree with my description that it is a little place in the back of beyond?
A.	It is the centre where some market, like weekly market, are arranged or organised.  Nearby, there is a church, there's a secteur office.  So it's the headquarters of secteur office.  And through the records, this happened to be -- there happened to be a house of witness pseudonym GIN, which is marked by H3.
Q.	Yes.  May I just say that that would have been a welcome piece of information if I'd had it last week, when I was there in Gikomero but I only got this last night.  But you've identified a particular witness's home there, GIN?
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, I would object to that comment by counsel.  It's not the fault of this witness that he did not receive documentation at that point in time.  It was duly served.
MR. HOOPER:
I'm certainly not blaming Mr. Baghel, whose very helpful report was made all of a month ago.  I'm merely noting the regrettable delay in serving this on the Defence.  And I think we've been through this and we needn't go through it again.  I would have thought it's beyond dispute, really, but there we are. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, would you agree that this is a small place, in the back of beyond?
A.	This is the place known as Gikomero centre where secteur office is located, and I don't understand the meaning of "small" or "big."  That's how centres are located in Rwanda.  There is some commercial activity, like, they will have some commercial activities, a few shops and maybe the office of the administration.  That's why secteur offices are there, maybe church; Gikomero parish is there. 
Q.	Can I turn now to route 3?  Route 3 takes you from your point, it is point 10 on the map, which you describe as being the diversion to Kigali - Rwamagana road at 10.  And route 3 takes you up through M, N, F and E; is that right?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Would that be the Rubungo route?  Would that be a good way of describing it or not?
A.	Yes.
Q.	So we could call that route 3 the Rubungo route because it goes through another neighbouring commune called Rubungo?
A.	Yeah, it passes through Rubungo commune and the place where Rubungo is marked, where I put -- marked N.  It is also a place like centre called Ndera.
Q.	In fact, just by N, we can see the word "Rubungo," and with a better map we might see that even better, particularly if it's the same scale as it was -- originally was.  That's a point I make.  

So you go through Rubungo and up to Gikomero secteur office that way.  And again, that involves a steep climb up to the top of the massif, up to the top of the plateau; is that correct?
A.	It's a mixture of steep or gentle climb and somewhere like a level place.
Q.	But, again, you wouldn't take your saloon car up there, would you?
A.	I don't know.
Q.	You would take it up there, would you?
A.	I have not taken during that visit or any of the official missions because I never carried out any private missions in my personal car to these areas.
Q.	Now, I make clear I'm not suggesting that a saloon car can't get up there; many local people use it.  But all your timings and your preference are for sturdy four-wheel-drive car?
A.	Yes, these timings and distance is by using four-wheel cars of the office.
Q.	And you've lived in Rwanda now for, off and on, what, three years?
A.	Yes, more than three years.
Q.	And in April, there's the long rains; is that right?
A.	I don't remember now. 
Q.	In April, the rains fall mainly in the morning?
A.	I don't remember these things. 
Q.	As opposed to the rains now, which fall mainly in the afternoon; isn't that right?
A.	In Rwanda, any time rains can happen.  So I don't remember, because Rwanda is having sufficient rainfall.
Q.	Well, it doesn't rain, does it, from May the 21st until October, at all, does it?
A.	I don't know because I have not noted down these dates when it rains and when it not rains.
Q.	Well, you're not perhaps a meteorologist, and you're not there as a meteorologist, and you don't recall.  But the rains affect those earthen roads, don't they, and they wash it away?
A.	Yeah.  During the experience, I have found rain affects the roads, and some roads are maintained, and you find after some time roads are maintained by local people and they put some mud or some stones.  That is how we are able to move -- move around. 
Q.	Route 4 goes again from Kigali.  It's not very different to the other route, in terms of where it starts.  It starts at Remero; is that right?
A.	Yes.
Q.	That's where the -- is that where the stadium is?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Which is a big and obvious landmark.  And that's where the TPIR is based, up there; is that right?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And that route takes you up through A, B, D, and then you turn right along the top of the plateau to Gikomero secteur via E, getting to G.  That's route 4?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And those routes, as we can see from the timings in your powerful four-wheel-drive vehicle, takes approximately, to Gikomero secteur, whichever route you go, but in that vehicle, takes about an hour, with the exception of route 2, which you've done in 40 minutes, and you've given us your times there.  We can work it out ourselves. 

Now, one of the perhaps confusing features is that there's both a Gikomero commune, which is the total area, and then there's the little place, as I call it, Gikomero secteur, and that can lead to confusion, can't it?
A.	Yes.  That's why I've explained.  It's a commune, and place C is where office of Gikomero commune is located, and place G where secteur office is located.
Q.	Yes.  And we can see where Gikomero commune office is in the top-middle of our plan at C, and that's at a place called Gishaka; is that right?
A.	Yes.  Gishaka is the secteur, secteur where this commune office is located.  So this particular secteur is called Gishaka, G-I-S-H-A-K-A.
Q.	And there we find rather more substantial local authority buildings; indeed, that's where the commune office is?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And we can see from the road you've indicated leading down to the commune office that's it's a cul de sac, is that right? 
A.	Excuse me, what is that? 
Q.	It's a no-through-road. 
A.	Because that road is not very relevant, that's why I did not mark, and I did not go on that road further.  But there are small roads.  I told earlier these are not -- all the roads have not been covered.  These are the main roads, but there are small roads where vehicles can go.  They may be branching off at certain locations again, joining these roads.
Q.	All right.  So have you, yourself, been down from Gikomero commune office down towards K, point K?  Have you done that?
A.	I have not done on this road.  This road, just I went few kilometres during my whole investigation to meet some of the witnesses in previous cases or something, and I never drove on this road to go into K.
Q.	Very well.  Now, finally, there's a road which, or a route -- let me just see -- which you haven't indicated or measured, as I understand it.  And that's the road that takes you out from Kigali on the tarmac road towards point -- to point L.  Yes?  And then you turn right at point L, and you can drive up along that line of hill to D and on to Gikomero secteur; is that right?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And would that take you, in your vehicle, about the same time as the sort of time the other routes take?
A.	Roughly, we can estimate the same thing, but during this trip on 5th November, I did not take this road.  That's why I've not put in my timings.
Q.	It's not a criticism.  It's just an observation.  It is about the same time it takes to get up there?
A.	Approximately.
Q.	All right.  Now, André Rwamakuba, who I represent, his family live at Nduba.  Can you indicate on the map for us where Nduba is?
A.	I have not visited this place, so I can only indicate by going through the map, but it will not be -- it will not be from that where Nduba is there because I have not gone to visit his family members' house.
Q.	Nduba is a very well-known part of the commune.  Can you indicate where it is for us?
A.	Again, I have to go through the map.  It is on -- if you say the road which goes from L, the road which branches off from L, and it goes, and there's a place called Nduba which is marked there. 
Q.	Yes.  Your eyesight may be better than -- certainly better than mine.
A.	So Nduba is marked in such a way that it is a secteur.  That's how -- because in the map, in that phonetics, the secteurs have been written.
Q.	And that's -- Nduba -- how can I put it, it's slightly to the left of the word "commune"?  Gikomero commune office, if we go to the -- move our line left of there, just where the road takes a sharp bend, Nduba is marked. 
A.	Yes, Nduba is marked there.
Q.	And, indeed, can you help me as to this?  Because there's a route, isn't there, from Nduba down to the church and community at Kibuye, which is on the main tarmac road, quite an important link with that area?  Can you find Kibuye for us?
A.	There are many places on the map.  I have not been all the places.  I have gone during the investigation few places where are marked, so I cannot say which is the road, which road is going where, and these roads are not the exhaustive lists.  There is many roads which are seen on the map.
Q.	Yes.  I'm dealing with the principal roads, and Kibuye is one of the main places on the road out of -- out of Kigali towards Byumba.  It's one of the first places you meet, by the rice fields there.  You don't know it?
A.	Yes, there is a place. 
Q.	If we look at point L on the map, to cross -- to come away from the tarmac road at point L to go to Gikomero, you have to cross a bridge; is that right?  Because there's a river that flows down that way, a main river.
A.	Yes, there's a river on this site.
Q.	And the bridge you cross there is -- just give me one moment -- is called the Nyabarongo bridge; is that right?  And that takes you up to Sha, the secteur Sha?  I mean, if you don't know, then I won't pursue it with you.  Do you know the name of the bridge there?
A.	I don't know the name of that bridge, but there's a bridge on that road, I remember. 
Q.	I mention that because where Kibuye is, which is about three centimetres down from L -- or four -- there's another bridge which you have to cross if you want to go that way up towards Nduba, and that bridge and area is known as Nyacyonga.  Can you help us as to that?
A.	I don't know the names of those bridges; but there are many bridges; many roads are there.
Q.	Well, there's two bridges and no other bridges, isn't that right?
A.	I don't remember exactly how many bridges are there, because if you take a road, there's a river, a bridge has to be there.
Q.	Yes, but there's hardly any bridges to cross the river.  There's only two, Nyacyonga --
A.	I don't know.  
Q.	The bridge I'm talking about is the one just past the greenhouses.  Mrs. Kagame's  greenhouse is there?
A.	I don't know that house.
Q.	It's a great big area covering about a hectare of greenhouses?
A.	No, I don't know that place.
Q.	You don't know it?
A.	No.
Q.	Have you been up that road often or not?
A.	On this road, which is going through L, I do not go very recently.  Recently, I travel on the road to K, J, I, H.  That's why I've not mentioned, but this road I travelled a long time back.  In last three and a half years, I've been many times to these areas.
Q.	But this road is the main road, isn't it?  It's the main road up to Byumba out of Kigali?
A.	Yes, it's the main road to Byumba, but the thing is I don't know which house is where on the road, unless it is of my interest.
Q.	Can you just help -- I think you have indicated on your very helpful map, the Diplomat Hotel -- at least I thought you had -- the Diplomat Hotel.  Maybe you -- I thought I saw it.  Anyway, is it about 4, 3 or 4?
A.	I have not indicated specifically Diplomat Hotel, but point 4 is the town centre, and the Diplomat Hotel is not very far from town centre.
Q.	Is not very what?
A.	Is not very far from town centre.
Q.	Well, you've got numbers there you've given us.  Where's the Diplomat?
A.	It's not marked here, but it should be somewhere where 4 is marked.
Q.	Yes, I thought so.  So -- and that would be, obviously, quite the other side of town from Remera, wouldn't it?
A.	Yeah.  Remera is around the point 8, 13 and 7.  Remera is also quite large area.
Q.	And the Diplomat is in that area, general area, where there's the Milles Collines and various government offices are?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Up there.  The CND, where we were told there was a -- yesterday, a battalion of FPR, that's at 1, is it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	CND being the parliament building.  And it's at point 1, which dominates the route west to Remera, that the FPR were, we were told, were based?
MS. MAKWAIA:
I object, Your Honours, to this question.  I was trying to lead evidence in this aspect and counsel objected.  That evidence was excluded from this witness. 
MR. HOOPER:
Indeed, it was, but I'm relying on the Prosecution opening yesterday, when we were told that this was the case.  I'm not asking this witness.  It was an assertion that was made in the course of the opening yesterday, of which I do not dissent, incidentally, that the FPR were in place under the Arusha Accords at the CND building, which this witness has usefully identified on his map as point 1.  May I continue?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, but you cannot ask questions on matters that were not raised during the examination-in-chief. 
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.  Those are all my questions, Mr. Baghel.  Thank you very much.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Mr. Hooper.  

Are there any other questions to the witness still with regard to the cross-examination?  Any other questions by other counsel?  No.  

Well, we thank you.  Thank you, Witness.  

Counsel for the Prosecution, do you want to re-examine the witness?  Miss Makwaia, do you want to re-examine the witness? 
MS. MAKWAIA:
I've got about two or three questions.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  You have the floor.
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Mr. Baghel, you've been asked about the conditions of the map that you've included in your bundle, and it was stated by counsel that it was not visible.  You replied that you had a bigger map of Rwanda, in the form of a tourist map.  Do you have that map with you right now?
A.	Yes, I have that map right now.
Q.	Can you please open it?
MR. O'SHEA:
Madam President, could we just have a pause for one moment while my lead counsel gets his microphone sorted out?
MR. HOOPER:
I've had six microphones this morning and none of them have worked.  I don't know whether it's anything to do with this end of the room.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is the problem solved so that we may continue? 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  

Miss Makwaia, you may proceed. 
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Can you open that map and tell us what it is?
A.	As I told you, this is a tourist map of Rwanda.  This is a little bigger map, where many places can be seen and may be visible also. 
Q.	And what is the source of that map?
A.	This map I purchased in Kigali from a tourist shop, that is ORTPN.
Q.	And this is an administrative and road map of Rwanda; is that correct, Mr. Baghel?
A.	This is titled as "Rwanda carte à touristique map".
Q.	Could you please show it to Their Honours and counsel before I tender it as a Prosecution exhibit?
MR. HOOPER:
I've no objection to it being tendered.
MS. MAKWAIA:
I just want to ensure that everything is legible on this one, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take due note of that.
MS. MAKWAIA:
With your permission, I tender it as Prosecution exhibit P. 3 -- P. 4.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The tourist map is admitted into evidence as Prosecution Exhibit P 4. 
(Exhibit No. P. 4 admitted)

MR. MARTEL:
I'm sorry for interrupting the re-examination.  Does the map bear a date?  When was the map made?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Baghel, is there a date on the map? 
THE WITNESS:
I don't think so because this is locally available in the shops as a general item.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Since when did you buy it?
THE WITNESS:
As far as I remember, I purchased this map in the month of August or September of this year.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, it was suggested to you that -- I'm going to rephrase that.  Now, apart from powerful Nissan vehicles taking the roads to Gikomero from various points you've indicated in your map, what other types of vehicles can pass through these roads?
A.	I have not driven any other vehicle but I can give my opinion only. 
Q.	So other vehicles can pass on these roads, apart from powerful Nissan vehicles?
A.	Yes, because I have been on these roads for the last -- many years, and I have seen big trucks passing on the roads and saloon cars also passing on the road, but not many, because these roads are not used very frequently.  It's not like highway roads, having asphalted roads.
Q.	And, finally, based on your investigations of 1990 -- based on your investigations in Gikomero commune of the killings that took place in 1994, have you any basis to explain why Ndatemwa -- a small place -- why Ndatemwa is a small place in the back of beyond?
MR. HOOPER:
It was Gikomero secteur that I suggested was a small place in the back of beyond.
MS. MAKWAIA:
I stand corrected.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Proceed, Madam Makwaia.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Do you want me to repeat the question? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, the question was, based on your investigations of the killings in 1994 in Gikomero secteur, do you have any basis to explain why Gikomero secteur is a small place in the back of beyond?
A.	The Ndatemwa centre is in Gasabo secteur, and the road which I put in my map, K, J, I, H, G, like G is Gikomero secteur; H is Karanga secteur; I is Rutunga secteur.  Then J comes, which is Gasabo secteur.  And on the basis of few statements which I have gone through, I read during my investigations, it is believed that in this centre arms were distributed and a few people were killed in the period after the death of the president. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Thank you, Your Honours.  I have no further questions for the witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, a small question.  The mass grave of which you spoke, is it possible to identify the spot, or is it only in relation to the electricity pole that you've referred to?
THE WITNESS:
If I can refer to the photograph in the binder about Butare hospital, photo 14.  Is that okay, photo 14?  Where the small crops are grown, small vegetation is there, this is the place, open area, where supposed to be mass grave was there.  So it may be a few metres before the pole, electric pole, and that small building which is seen.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We thank you, Witness Mr. Baghel.  You have now finished giving your testimony.  You've finished testifying, and we wish you a safe journey home.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you very much.
(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Mr. Prosecutor, we had planned to hear the two investigators today, but it is already past 1:00, so I'm asking you, can we hear Mr. Lucassen now? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, there's no problem.  He's in the waiting room.  We can begin.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How long will the examination-in-chief last?  We had planned on an hour and a half for Mr. Baghel and it's lasted three and a half hours.  How long for Mr. Lucassen? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Approximately the same thing, perhaps a bit shorter, but there is also cross-examination.  But we are ready to begin.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution. 

Very well.  If all the parties are in agreement, we can begin with hearing Witness Lucassen and continue on Monday morning.  Because I'd be surprised if we could finish today both 
examination-in-chief and cross.  We can continue until two o'clock or 2:30. 

MR. HOOPER:
Would it not be, with respect, better for us to take a luncheon adjournment now, because we have been sitting since nine o'clock, and come back after lunch and deal with it then?
(Witness enters courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Let's begin, and perhaps we'll break later. 

Good afternoon, Mr. Lucassen. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are going to testify before this Trial Chamber.  Before undertaking the examination-in-chief by the Prosecutor and cross by the Defence, we would pray you make the solemn declaration. 
(Declaration made by Antonius Maria Lucassen in English)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Lucassen.  Thank you, Registrar. 

You may sit down. 

Counsel for the Prosecution, you may begin examination-in-chief of this witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Let me state at the outset that the objective of this direct examination is to place in evidence three booklets, one for Ruhengeri, one for Murambi and one for Gisenyi town.  We'll start with the Ruhengeri materials.
ANTONIUS MARIA LUCASSEN,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Lucassen, would you begin by telling the Court your full name, please, and your occupation?
A.	My full name is Antonius Marie Lucassen.  Lucassen is Legal Uniform Charlie Alpha Sierra Sierra Echo November.  And I'm working as an investigator at the Office of the Prosecutor of ICTR.
Q.	And how long have you been working for the ICTR?
A.	I'm working with ICTR since five years.
Q.	So you began when, please?
A.	To be precise, I have been with ICTR for eight months in 1998, and then I've been away for a year.  I came back in 1999, and I am -- since then I'm still with ICTR.
Q.	In terms of your experience between your first period of employment and your second, can you tell us what you did in the interim?
A.	Part of the interim period I was in Kosovo as what they call verifier for the OSCE, the Office for Security and Cooperation in Europe, if I say it well.
Q.	And what was your occupation?  What were you doing professionally for them?
A.	As a verifier, I was there as a human rights investigator, which means that I was investigating human rights violations, human rights crimes committed in Kosovo in that period.
Q.	And prior to joining the ICTR in 1998, did you have any previous investigative experience?
A.	Yes, I do.  I was mainly a policeman, police officer, in The Netherlands.
Q.	When did you join the police force in The Netherlands?
A.	I have to refer to my notes.  I think it was in 1990 -- no, it must have been 1986.
Q.	And can you tell us what your status was, what your job description was?
A.	I was a police officer, a police constable, in the general sense of the word, which means I was investigating whatever came in my way:  crimes, traffic accidents, people with complaints, et cetera.
Q.	Did you receive any training for the work that you did in the police department?
A.	Yes, before starting, there was the regular police training school that I attended, and after that, there were regular courses.
Q.	Did you get any specific training in investigative procedures?
A.	Yes.  Over the years, I got several specific training in investigating procedures.
Q.	Can you tell us your educational background, please?
A.	Before joining the police, I have been in university.  I have a Master's degree.  The degree is in science of human movement, which is not directly related to the career that I'm following now.
Q.	Returning to your employment with the ICTR, can you tell us what your duties have been over the past three or four years since you've been employed by the OTP?
A.	I have been a general investigator, which means that I investigate crime site scenes in Rwanda about what happened in 1994 and that I look for evidence related to what happened there. 
Q.	In terms of investigating crime scenes for the ICTR, or for the office of the Prosecution, can you tell us how many different cases you have investigated with respect to crime scenes?
A.	I have investigated a lot of different crime scenes, more than dozens.
Q.	Have you ever appeared in court before to testify about your investigation of a crime scene?
A.	Yes, I appeared in court I think five times before in different cases. 
Q.	And in those cases, could you give us the names of the cases that you appeared in, please?
A.	I was a witness in the Bagilishema case in October 1999; in the Kajelijeli case in 2001; in the Kamuhanda case in April 2001; Ntakirutimana, September 2001; Niyitegeka, June 2002.
Q.	And when you testified previously, did you have to submit exhibits as evidence in those court appearances?
A.	Yes, I have always given exhibits, yes.
Q.	And those are the exhibits that you assembled yourself or --
A.	That has been a mixture.  Most of the exhibits I assembled myself.  In a few cases, I have been asked to present material that has come to our evidence unit in other ways. 
Q.	Mr. Lucassen, are you familiar with the area -- or the region, rather, of Ruhengeri in Rwanda?
A.	Yes, I am.
Q.	And what was the basis of your becoming familiar with Ruhengeri?
A.	I've been there several times with specific missions related to the cases of Kajelijeli and Nzirorera.
Q.	And in the context of those missions, were you ever asked to prepare exhibits or photographs for the case of Kajelijeli or Nzirorera?
A.	Yes, I was asked to do so in 2001.
Q.	Did you prepare anything with regard to your investigations in Ruhengeri for the present case, for the case against Joseph Nzirorera?
A.	In 2001, I prepared a document that at the moment was supposed to be relevant for both Kajelijeli and Nzirorera, yes.
Q.	Do you have a copy of those materials with you?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	Could I have the -
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, Mr. Webster.  

Madam President, would you excuse me?  I'm going to go down to the detention centre --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HOOPER:
(Microphone overridden) ... to deal with Mr. Lucassen in due course.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Counsel.
MR. WEBSTER:
If I could have the court management assistant hand up the copy of the binder of Ruhengeri to the witness, please.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Lucassen, taking a look at what's been placed before you, can you identify that for us, please?
A.	Yes.  This is a binder of Ruhengeri.  As it is written on the first page, "containing maps, sketches and photographs," and I compiled this binder recently.  Basically, it is material prepared in 2001.
Q.	If you look at the initial page, which is the copy of the binder, is there a number on that page that would identify it as having been submitted to the Office of the Prosecutor's evidence, a K-number or an L-number? 
A.	Yes.  The first K-number that I see is K0164878.
Q.	And what is the last page in the binder on which a K-number appears?
A.	The last K-number -- the last K-number of the binder itself is K0167249, and after that photographs are following.
Q.	Would you identify the K-number for the first photograph, please, on the following page?
A.	The first photograph has K-number K0275232.
	 (Pages 39 to 57 by Karen Holm-Porter)































	1315H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And if you turn to the last pages of photographs, would you identify the K-number on the last photograph in the binder?
A.	The last photograph has K-number K0275273.
Q.	All right.  Turning our attention back to the cover page, Mr. Lucassen, can you tell us the date on which this binder was assembled?
A.	I assembled it on 5 November 2003, and that's when I signed it.
Q.	Okay, and is that your signature below your name that's printed on the cover?
A.	Yes, it is.
Q.	Turning to the following page, can you describe the contents of the following page and the signatures on that page?
A.	The following page is K0164878.  The page is called "Maps" and it gives the contents of the first part of this binder, which are several maps.  It has been signed by myself and my colleague, Kitila Mkumbo who was working together with me on that mission.
Q.	I notice that there are two signatures there for your -- which I would assume are your signatures; it says "T. Lucassen".  Could you tell us -- could you explain why there are two signatures and why there is a date below the one on the bottom of the page?
A.	Yes, most of the work we do as investigators is in couples, and on this occasion I was working with my colleague, Kitila Mkumbo, and he signed also.  And the 12 of January 2001 is the date that we received the documents from the UNDP office in Kigali, which is the UN office that has, as one of its tasks, to supply documents to other UN offices.
Q.	Directing your attention to the second time that you signed this page, I believe it states underneath your signature 30/10/03.  Can you explain when you signed and why you signed at that time?
A.	Yes, I signed it again recently because in 2001 a few mistakes were found in these documents, and I corrected them recently.  That's why I signed with the date.
Q.	Are the contents of the material the same as is reflected on that cover page?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Perhaps you could read that to us and tell us if it's still accurate.
A.	Yes, it is still accurate which means there is the cover page we are actually looking at, and then there are four more pages, a map of Ruhengeri préfecture, and then three maps of parts of Ruhengeri préfecture, which are Kinigi commune, Mukingo commune and Nkuli commune.
Q.	Directing your attention to the following page; this is K-number K0164879.  Can you tell us the contents of this page, please?
A.	This is a map of the Ruhengeri préfecture in Rwanda.
Q.	Is this one of the maps that you received from UNDP?
A.	Yes, it is.
Q.	There is a notation on this map that is handwritten.  Can you explain that notation to us, please?
A.	Yes, I can.  I signed a correction of a secteur name.  The commune name of that part of Ruhengeri is Mukingo, and with most eyes, Mukingo can probably be read.  Just above Mukingo is the secteur name, one of the secteurs of Mukingo.  I encircled it, and that one is written wrong.  It was written "Mukingo" but it should be "Muhingo", so the "Kilo" should be a "Hotel".
Q.	And then I noticed that you have signed it and dated it; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Is this map drawn to scale as far as you know?
A.	Yes, it is, and the scale is shown on the right down side of the map, with a distance of 10 or 20 kilometres.
Q.	And there is also an indication on the map of when it was actually printed or published; is that so?
A.	Yes, I see is it in the left down corner, in 1999.
Q.	Directing your attention to the following page, K-number K0164880.  Would you tell us the contents of this page?
A.	This is a map of Kinigi commune, which is a part of Ruhengeri préfecture.  So the map that we just saw on the previous page, it is here in the right top corner, and the part that we see, Kinigi, is the commune that is on the north-west side of Ruhengeri préfecture.
Q.	Did you make any notations yourself on this page?
A.	No, I did not.
Q.	Going to the next page which ends in number 2881, would you please tell us the contents of this page and any notations that were made on the page?
A.	This is the map of Mukingo commune.  On the right topside there is again the whole of Ruhengeri préfecture, and Mukingo commune is on the west side of Ruhengeri préfecture.  And I made the same correction as on the earlier map.  The Mukingo secteur, which is kind of in the middle of Mukingo commune, is not "Mukingo" but it should be "Muhingo"; not a "Kilo" but a "Hotel".
Q.	Well, with respect to this correction that you've made, what is the source of your information in terms of the misspelling, whether the correct spelling is "Muhingo" or "Mukingo"?
A.	The spelling of names in Rwanda is often a source of confusion, but in this case, it was confirmed to me by government authorities, and I saw it on another map.  And it is quite obvious for me that "Muhingo", with "Hotel", is the right spelling.
Q.	Okay.  But in terms of the configuration of the map, the way the map has identified or lays out the territory, do you see any inaccuracy based on your visits to Mukingo?
A.	No, I don't see any inaccuracy.
Q.	Moving on to the next page which ends in No. 882,.please tell us the contents and if there are any other notations on this page.
A.	The map of Nkuli commune, on the right topside, is again the whole of Ruhengeri préfecture and Nkuli is the commune which is on the west -- the south-west side of Ruhengeri préfecture.  No further special things about this map.
Q.	In other words, you did not make any -- any notations on this page?
A.	I did not make any notations on this page.
Q.	The next page, which ends in 869, would you tell us the contents of this page and any notation that you yourself have made?
A.	This is page is called Mukingo-Nkuli sketch.  And this is the first page of the second part of the binder, the Mukingo-Nkuli sketch part.  It was prepared by myself, in collaboration with my colleague, Mkumbo, Kitila, in January 2001.  I signed it again recently to -- because I made an addition of a location that I thought was relevant.
Q.	Now, for this part of the binder, portion of sketches, how many pages comprise the portion of the binder on sketches?
A.	The part of the Nkuli-Mukingo sketch is five pages, after that starts the part of the Busogo parish sketch.
Q.	All right.  Directing your attention to the Mukingo-Nkuli sketch, you've listed on that cover page contents, this cover page, one sketch page, two pages behind -- excuse me, two pages legend with index, and one page index with sources; total of five pages.  Is that an accurate accounting of this portion of the binder?  Are all of those items included in the binder?
A.	Yes, they are.
Q.	Directing your attention to the Busogo parish sketch, the cover for that section which ends in 874.  Would you explain your notations on that page, please?
A.	Yes, this is the first page of the Busogo parish sketch, part of the binder, which is, in total, four pages.  As the name says, it is the sketch of a parish in Busogo, in Ruhengeri.  I made it together with my colleague, Mkumbo, Kitila, in January 2001. 
Q.	Looking at the contents, as they have -- as they are described on that cover page, would you read them out and then tell me if it's an accurate reflection of what's included in the binder?
A.	The contents are this cover page, one sketch page, one page legend with an index, and one page of an index of our sources.  That is correct.
Q.	All right, Mr. Lucassen, I'm going to go back to the Mukingo-Nkuli sketch, the sketch itself, which appears on the page ending in 870.  Who actually made this sketch, was it you or your partner or did both of you make it together?
A.	Yes, we did the mission together but I made the sketch.
Q.	So in terms of this specific sketch, Mukingo-Nkuli sketch, that's your work exclusively?
A.	Yes, it is.
Q.	Explain to us how you actually came up with this.  What did you do to generate this sketch?
A.	As a basis for this area, I decided to use a map that we have at ICTR, 1:50,000 map.  What I did after that is I put A4 size paper, like the one we use in this binder on top of that map and I copied the main roads on my A4 paper.
Q.	Before you go on, please tell us what the map -- the original source map, would you describe that to us, please?  Do you have it with you?
A.	Yes, I have it, not exact one that I used but an equal one that we currently have.
Q.	Perhaps you could hold it up so that the Court could see it and the parties.
A.	It is a map of a scale of 1:50,000, which means that two centimetres is one kilometre.  It is called "Ruhengeri" and on the back side is an overview of the other maps in this series that covers Uganda-Rwanda, plus the legends explaining what the symbols on the map mean.
Q.	Is this also a map that you received from UNDP?
A.	No, this map is in ICTR archives.
Q.	But who produced the map?  What's the source of the map?
A.	This map is produced by service cartographie du Rwanda, 1988, and similar maps have been printed later by a Canadian printing company for the use of UNAMIR.
Q.	All right. 
MR. WEBSTER:
With the Court's permission, I would like to have Mr. Lucassen approach the overhead projector with the map and with his binder.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, you can proceed to screen it.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	What you've placed on the overhead is the map, the source map that you used to generate your sketch.  And perhaps you can even centre it in the area of the map that concerns Mukingo, which I assume is the centrepiece of your sketch.
A.	Okay, this is the top page of the map.  Part of Ruhengeri town is on it, and the parts that I used for my sketch is currently centred.  This is Mukingo, and this is Nkuli. 
Q.	And I see a dotted line running through the centre of the map.  Could you trace your finger over that please and just follow it for the Court, the main tarmac road.
A.	This is the main tarmac road leading from the direction of Ruhengeri town towards the direction of Gisenyi town.
Q.	Now, would you place your sketch on top of that, if you can?
A.	This, again, is the same tarmac road from Ruhengeri in the direction of Gisenyi.
Q.	Now, directing our attention to your sketch, which, again, is the document -- it's a document -- excuse me, it's the page ending in 870 -- some sort of security thing, I don't know.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is that why we are having problems?  We have a more serious problem and it may be necessary for the technicians to assist.  Can you cope with all this noise?  Okay, you can cope with it. 
MR. WEBSTER:
May I proceed or?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Proceed.  We will try and see whether this problem will be solved in due course.
BY  MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	(Microphone overlap) the tarmac road which is the line running to the centre of your sketch, directing your attention to the other indications that you've made, point to them on the screen, please, the lines going off to the left.
A.	Yes, as I said, this is the main tarmac road from Ruhengeri to Gisenyi.  This is a dirt road leading -- starting at ISAIE complex leading along Busogo parish and going in this way to Kinigi commune, and this way to Nkuli commune.
Q.	Now, with respect to those indications, the road that you just outlined, did you draw those yourself or are those also indicated on the map that you used to draw the main tarmac road?
A.	They are from the map.
Q.	And if you look two-thirds down the page there is a dotted line.
A.	Yes, the dotted line is also from the map.  It is the border between Mukingo and Muhingo commune.
Q.	And could you explain the other notations that you've made on this page?  I'm referring to the numbers and the boxes.
A.	Yes.  For instance, No. 3 is Mukingo communal office, opposite No. 18, which is Ruhehe hill.  
Number 23 is what is called Bisesero communal football ground.  Current there is a demobilisation camp there.  Number 9, people call it ISAIE, I think in English it is the Higher Institute for Agriculture and Animal Husbandry.  It's a huge school complex; some of the buildings have two floors.
Q.	The little box that's below the 9, is that your indication of where the school, or is that something else?
A.	Yes, sorry, this is the complex.
Q.	And if we direct our attention to No. 7 there is another little box there.  Is No. 7 identifying that other configuration?
A.	Number 7 is Busogo parish, a Catholic Church complex which is also sketched in detail in my following sketch.
Q.	But the box itself is an indication of what is described in your legend at No. 7; is that correct?
A.	Yes, it is.
Q.	I'm trying to make the distinction between the numbers and the other configurations because some of your numbers stand alone and some of them are next to other types of indications.  When we look at No. 20, can you describe that for us please?
A.	Number 20 refers to this oval area which can be seen in the legend as an agricultural area where witnesses showed several killing sites.
Q.	And then would you please tell us what No. 5 means and No. 6 means in the boxes next to those two numbers?
A.	Number 5 is a house of Mr. Kajelijeli, and the No. 6 is a bar of Mr. Kajelijeli, and No. 4 refers to the roads leading along Kajelijeli's house.
Q.	Now, I take it from your earlier testimony, regarding your signature at the bottom of the page ending in 869, that you've recently looked at all of these materials to ensure their accuracy.  Is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	So with respect to everything that's indicated on page 870, items 1 through -- I believe the last item is 22 -- 23.  Yes, items 1 through 23 are listed in your legend which appears in pages 871 and 872.  Is that so?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And is all of that information accurate, to the best of your knowledge?
A.	To the best of my knowledge, it is accurate, yes.
Q.	Now, you described quite a number of different things on this sketch, and again I'm referring to this sketch on page 870.  Where did all of the information come from?  Was this your personal observation or were there other sources of information?
A.	Part of it is my own observation, part of it comes simply from the base map that I used and part of it comes from persons, from sources, yes.
Q.	Are the sources of your information indicated on the legend?
A.	Yes, for each of the numbered items the source is mentioned on the separate page, which is in the document immediately after the legend.
Q.	And there we are referring to the page 873, K-number ending in 873?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	There are a number of items, even on page 873, that do not have an indication of a source.  Are we to assume that that is -- those indications were made on your own -- on the basis of your own personal knowledge, for example, No. 1, No. 2, number --
A.	Yes, it is correct.  It's information I have either from the map or that I imply saw myself.
Q.	Number 14?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And where you have mentioned the names, or as is indicated on the exhibit, pseudonyms, to identify your various sources, the information that you've included on the sketch, is that coming from a document or from a conversation with these individuals?
A.	It comes from conversations, basically.  They showed it to me.
Q.	I'd like to direct your attention -- now moving on to Busogo parish sketch.  We'll take a look at 
page 875 or K-number ending in 875.  Tell us how you made this sketch.
A.	This sketch is made in a different way.  I had no map available on a scale that was relevant for these buildings, so I walked around with a pen and a paper and started sketching.  This is the result of that.
Q.	Well, I noticed two names at the bottom of page ending at 875, yours and Mr. Mkumbo's.  What was his contribution to this -- to this sketch?
A.	We were together on the mission.  We were walking and driving around together in the area.  I was the one who did the actual drawing.
Q.	There is a legend that has been prepared for this sketch as well; is that -- is that so?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Numbered  -- with the index numbered one to 13 on page 876, or a page that is identified by K-number ending 876.  Is all of that information accurate --
A.	Yes, it is accurate.
Q.	-- to the best of your knowledge?  And where is this information coming from?
A.	I worked in the same way, which means that the page after the legend gives for each 13 items of the sketch, the sources.

1345H
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	How long did it take to generate this sketch, Mr. Lucassen?
A.	That was a combination of being in the area with witnesses, being in the area alone or with my colleague, and being in the office making a final version.  The part of the actual drawing is a few hours.
Q.	But directing your attention to the specific mission that you took in order to complete this sketch, was it the same mission that involved your doing the sketch of Mukingo-Nkuil, the sketch that we discussed a few minutes ago?
A.	Yes, it was in the same one-week mission.
Q.	You also took photographs which are included in this binder.  Was that a part of the same mission or was there a separate mission for that?
A.	The photographs were taken during the same mission.
Q.	Would it be accurate to characterise this mission as simply a crime base documentation mission?  Were there any other things that you were doing at the time?
A.	The main part of it was to make sketches and photographs, that's correct.
Q.	If we look at No. 1 on the Busogo parish sketch, for example, on your index, No. 1 is indicated as the School of Technical Sciences at Busogo.  Did you actually go up to that location and walk around?
A.	Yes, I've been there.  I walked, of course, along this car road, and I made small excursions to make this sketch as actual as -- as realistic as possible in the time that I had available.
Q.	For each of the 13 items that are indicated on that sketch, is it accurate to say that you personally went those locations and looked around?
A.	Yes, I did.
Q.	Did you show this sketch to any other witnesses that you spoke to to get the information?
A.	Personally, I did not show this sketch to any witnesses.
Q.	So this is your information based on -- excuse me -- your work product based on information that they provided?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	Let's move on to the next section, which is Photographs.  I'd like to direct your attention to the page starting with K-number, K0167242.  Would you tell us the contents of this page and the notations that you have made on the page, please?
A.	This page is called "Cover page -- Photographs".  It was made again by myself and my colleague, Kitila Mkumbo, in the same period between 15 and 19 January 2001.  At that moment it has been assembled in February 2001, and I recently checked it.
Q.	The fact that you've checked it is indicated by your signature at the bottom of the page?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And there is a date there?
A.	Yes, I signed it again on 30 October 2003.
Q.	Where it says "Corrected version", is that a notation that you made in February or in 2003?
A.	That is the corrections that I made in February 2001.
Q.	Would you read to us the contents of this section on photographs as reflected on this cover page, please?
A.	The contents is this cover page; one information page of how we worked to get the photographs, and six pages of comments on the photographs.  Apart from that, there is a compact disc with photographs, but in this document the photographs from the compact disc have been printed.
Q.	Directing your attention to the compact disc with the photographs, do you recall how many photographs were on that compact disc?
A.	On the compact disc were 42 photographs.
Q.	How many have been included in the binder here?
A.	All of them are in this binder.
Q.	Lets move on to the following page, top of the page, we see the notation "Information with photographs".  This is page No. K0167243.  Without reading, necessarily, tell us basically what the content of this page is.  What type of information have you included here?
A.	We wrote down that we took the photographs in January 2001 in Ruhengeri.  We had a digital camera and we downloaded them into the laptop every evening.  When we arrived in ICTR office in Kigali we gave the laptop to our Evidence Unit, who put the photographs on CDs.  

Apart from that, I write that every photograph has information about the photograph, information about the source who showed us the particular place, and if possible it has been related to the sketches.  Then there are the sources of information who helped us.
Q.	Let's take a quick look at some of the photographs.  If you go to the first page starting with K0275232, what is that a photograph of?
A.	This is a photograph in Ruhengeri town.  This is the appeal court in Ruhengeri town.
Q.	That goes on for three pages, is that accurate?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Just one question about these photographs: if we look at the second page, photograph K0275234, which is the top photograph on the page, and look at the second page with photograph K0275236, can we tell what this second photograph corresponds to from the front of the building that is indicated on the previous page?
A.	Yes.  In photograph ending with No. 234 it is looking from the tarmac road towards the appeal court.  The tarmac road is the main road from Kigali to Gisenyi, and one sees two fences.  There is a fence here and there is a fence here. 
Q.	You will have to describe them as one on the left side and one on the right side, if you would.  Looking at the photograph ending 5234, you indicated two fences, one on the right-hand side of the photograph and one on the left-hand side of the photograph.  If we can just go back to photograph 5234, looking at the photograph, itself.
A.	Yes, the front view and the right view of the appeal court.
Q.	When we look at the photograph of an interior courtyard, which is photograph 5236, can you link these interior courtyard photographs to the images that appear on the previous page where we see the front of the building.  I'm trying to get a sense of where these courtyards are in relation to the front of the building.
A.	Yes, I would link them by the fence.  This white fence is the site of the courtyard towards the tarmac road and it is the fence that can be seen here.
Q.	Which is the fence on the left-hand side of the photograph?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	And that is photograph 5234?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	What about photograph 5237, which is the lower photograph on that second page?  Can you tell us where that photograph is and from what angle the photograph has been taken?
A.	Yes, it is still inside the appeal court and it is taken from, more or less, the same spot as 5236, but now 5236 is in the direction of the street, whereas 5237 is parallel to the street, so it is behind the main court hall, but within the complex of the appeal court, and this place cannot at all be seen from the street.
Q.	Let's go quickly through the following pages.  If we flip the page and go to photograph 5238, what is that?
A.	Mukingo criminal office.
Q.	And below it, 5329?
A.	Again, Mukingo criminal office from a further distance.
Q.	On the next page, 5240?
A.	5240 is the markets of Biyangabo trading centre in Mukingo commune.
Q.	5241, below it?
A.	5241 has been shown to us as being the place where Nzirorera's mother's house was.  It was shown to us that the house was here, and the only reason that I saw that it is probable that there has been a house is the two parts of the wall that were probably supporting the fence.  They are still there, here and here.
Q.	Looking at both images on that page, what is the relationship of one to the other?  Are they near each other, facing each other, far from each other?  Is there any way that you can link them conceptually for us?
A.	Yes, they are near to each other.  The distance can be about 100 metres.  This one is in the heart of Biyangabo centre and this is -- if one drives from Ruhengeri in the direction of Gisenyi, then this is just before Biyangabo centre on the left-hand side, a little bit off the tarmac road.
Q.	Are these two images on the same side of the road or on opposite sides of the road?
A.	On the same side of the tarmac road.
Q.	Turning to page 5242, can you tell us what that image is, please?
A.	This has been described to me, this building, as Kajelijeli's bar.
Q.	And 5243?
A.	5243 just gives a general idea of Biyangabo trading centre.  There is a tarmac road, there is a wide area that is either empty or full with people selling things, and the buildings are a little bit down from the road.
Q.	What you described as Kajelijeli's bar at 5242, is that also in Biyangabo, or is that somewhere else?
A.	That is also in Biyangabo trading centre, yes.
Q.	Going to the next page and the image at the top of 5244, tell us what that is, please?
A.	5244 is also an overview of the Biyangabo trading centre.  The photo is taken a little bit in the direction of Gisenyi, and the actual centre of the trading centre is here.
Q.	Looking at that photograph, would you be able to point out where photograph 5241 would be?  I'm referring to Nzirorera's mother's house.  Just looking at 5244, can you make a connection between those two images in the photograph that is identified 5244, if you are able to?
A.	Yes, I can.  This photograph is taken from the direction of Gisenyi, which means that one is looking towards Ruhengeri.  If one would be driving this way, would go just past the centre, then on the right-hand side is Nzirorera's mother's house.
Q.	One last question, Mr. Lucassen.  I'd like to take you back to your sketch on page 870, the ERN ending in 870.  Is there a way to look at this image and see the entrance to Ruhengeri town, or is this off the map looking at this image?
A.	To go to Ruhengeri town, one has to go this way, continue for ten minutes' drive, and then one would be in Ruhengeri town, so it is off the map.
MR. WEBSTER:  
Your Honour, I would like to offer in evidence this binder of Ruhengeri, identify it as exhibit Prosecution 5.  If we could identify the entire binder as Prosecution Exhibit No. 5, and I'd like to offer it in evidence at this time.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Does the Defence have any objections?
MR. ROBINSON:  
Madam President, there is no objection.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you.  

The document entitled "Ruhengeri, maps, Mukingo/Nkuli, sketch, Busogo parish, sketch and photographs by Mr. Lucassen" -- I won't give the page numbers; I think you have sufficiently well identified the document.  The document is tendered and admitted as Prosecution Exhibit P. 5.
(Exhibit No. P. 5 admitted)
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I have a few other exhibits.  There are two other binders of exhibits to be offered in evidence.  I can go through them now or we can put this off to until Monday.  It's at your discretion.  The next two items will be much shorter than the first one.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  Tell us, Mr Webster, how long will you take, because the infrastructure is not in place to continue this afternoon?  How long will it take you to tender the other two exhibits?

We will continue on Monday.  We are compelled to stop now.  I hope that won't be a problem for your Monday witness.  Will it be all right with the witness if we go on on Monday morning? 
MR. WEBSTER:
It's not a problem.  There are other scheduling matters that we may need to raise, though.  As you know, the judgement in Kajelijeli is going to be delivered on Monday and one member of our team has to be present at that judgement and it was anticipated that she would take the following witness, so we either have to change the order of witnesses for Monday or we will have to start at 3:30, because the judgment is being read at 2:30, so whatever the Court suggests, we are happy to do.  It either means taking GBV as the first factual witness or starting at 3:30 as opposed to 2:30 in the afternoon.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That wouldn't bother us unduly if, at any rate, we continue with the witness, Lucassen, on Monday, and when we've finished hearing him we can hear the other witnesses, and I suppose by then the Kajelijeli judgment will have been delivered and we can tackle the witness that is programmed for Monday.
MR. WEBSTER: 
So, in other words, the witness that was to follow Mr. Lucassen was GBG.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. WEBSTER: 
If we start at 2:30 in the afternoon, we will not be able to start with GBG, we would have to start with a different witness, GBV, so at this stage what I'm asking the Court to resolve, and raising it with the parties, is whether we should agree to start our afternoon session on Monday at 3:30, in which case the order of witnesses would not be disturbed, or if the Court insists on starting at 2:30 as usual, then we would have to change the order of witnesses and take GBV before GBG.  I think Mr. Robinson is the counsel that is most directly affected.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Madam President, I don't mind whichever way the Prosecutor wants to do it, but I would simply like to know today in which order the witnesses will be on Monday, but either is fine with me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If I correctly understood, we can continue on Monday with Witness Lucassen.  When we have finished, we can take the witness who was programmed for Monday because the judgment will be delivered in the morning.
MR. WEBSTER: 
No, it's at 2:30.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  If the Defence has no problem, we will take the witness that was programmed for the next day.  There is no objection on the part of the Defence?  Okay.  So we will invert the order of appearance of the witnesses.  Is that all right for you?
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  

We shall now adjourn until Monday morning at 9:00 a.m. and continue with Mr. Lucassen.  

Thank you all, and I hope you have an enjoyable weekend.
(Court adjourned at 1420H)
