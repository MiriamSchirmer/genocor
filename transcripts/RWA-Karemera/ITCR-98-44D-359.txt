JEAN GHISTE,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued) 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And to you, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	Yesterday we left off talking about the note verbale that was issued by the Rwandese 
ministry of foreign affairs under the name of Bicamumpaka on the 15th of April 1994.  Simply to clarify matters, can we agree that a note verbale is a common form of written diplom -- excuse me, written communication in -- in diplomacy? 
A.	That's correct, Counsel.  It's indeed the fact.  
Q.	And it's usually unsigned with a stamp at the end.  But it represents the position of a government in the way that it states -- or government institutions deal with one another.  Based on your experience, is that also a reasonable summary of what a note verbale is? 
A.	Correctly so, Counsel.  
Q.	And the note verbale from Bicamumpaka on -- on behalf of the interim government accused Belgium of complicity with the RPF -- or it wasn't simply an accusation, but that it was implied in some of the paragraphs of that note verbale.  
A.	I became informed about that note verbale at the time of my -- when I gave testimony.  
Q.	So you're referring to January of 2008? 
A.	That's correct.  
Q.	And it's your evidence today that, prior to January 2008, you had no awareness of that particular document -- the existence of that document?  I'm not suggesting that you may have read every line of it, but are you suggesting that you had never even heard of it prior to January of 2008? 
A.	No.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  In any case, on the 15th of April 1994, when that note verbale was circulated to various diplomatic missions, your government was still dealing with the loss of the 
ten Belgian UNAMIR soldiers who were killed on the 7th of April; right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And by that time, again putting ourselves in the frame of reference of the 15th of April, there were already clear indications that persons who were associated with the interim government were responsible for those killings -- isn't that so -- thinking back to what you knew and thought on the 15th of April 1994?  
A.	On the 15th of April 1994, indeed, we had information pertaining to the murder of ten -- our Belgian troops.  But the circumstances of that situation were not quite clear regarding the information I personally received in Bujumbura.  
Q.	But there were clear indications that the ten Belgian soldiers had been killed by Rwandan government soldiers; right? 
A.	Indeed, these were members of the Rwandan armed forces. 
Q.	Now, you told us in direct examination that you had spoken to Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana on the night of the 6th to the 7th; right? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	And from the substance of your conversation with her, you could tell that she had already met with a person you described as the representative of the European Union -- or the European community, a Mr. Booh-Booh.  Is that accurate or would you like to clarify for us?  
A.	Yes, but I'd like to make a correction.  Mr. Booh-Booh -- that was a mistake -- he was the representative of the UN.  And there was a conversation -- I believe a telephone conversation for that matter.  
Q.	In other words, you understood from the prime minister that she had been in contact with Booh-Booh by telephone, not by personally meeting with him? 
A.	I'm not in a position to say whether there was a meeting, but to the best of my recollection, he (sic) mentioned a conversation which, I think, was over the telephone. 
Q.	"She" mentioned.  She, the prime minister; right? 
A.	Yes.  We communicated -- there was a communication, rather, sometime around midnight.  
Q.	Did the prime minister ever mention the name Bagosora to you during your conversation with her? 
A.	It is not to my recollection, and I do not think so.  
Q.	All she said is that -- all she told you was that she wanted to make a radio address.  She didn't mention anything about Bagosora in relation to her intention to address the nation by the radio -- over the radio? 
A.	She told me that she intended to make a radio address and to give a statement as early as possible in the morning of the 7th, and she, apparently to me, did not at any time mention Bagosora's name.  
Q.	Did she mention having had any contact with other members of her government? 
A.	No, not at all.  
Q.	There's evidence in this trial from other witnesses that the prime minister claimed not to have been able to locate or to contact the MRND ministers of her government, none of whom contacted her.  And that several of the opposition party ministers in her government had either disappeared or felt surrounded and threatened by the Presidential Guard.  

Having said that, does that provoke any further recollection from you about what the prime minister told you when you spoke to her that night? 
A.	It seemed to me that she had told me that she found it difficult to contact several persons so as to get a status of the events.  Her core concern was to understand what had happened and also to have more specific information.  She did not tell me specifically that she had made attempts to contact one or the other minister.  On the contrary, she told me specifically that she had been in contact with UNAMIR to request for protection.  
Q.	Well, thank you for that response.  But I'm interested in the first portion of your -- of your last response, when you mentioned that she told you she was trying to contact some persons and was unable to do so.  Can you go back to that portion of your last response and elaborate on that portion of your response, if you can.  
A.	Counsel, I do not quite have the material because in the -- regarding that communication, I was concerned also to have the status of the events, and also the prevailing security situation.  Because on that same night, I was able to contact two or three of my cooperation staff but not all of the cooperation staff, and that is what -- that, rather, was my concern.  I was trying as swiftly as possible to have security measures taken.  
Q.	Well, the issue that should be of interest to this Chamber is what prevented the prime minister from contacting the other ministers of her government.  So that's what I'm trying to find out from you.  To the extent that it's possible -- I mean, if you have no information, clearly you can simply say that and I'll move on, but if you can jog your memory a bit, that could assist us.  

So my question to you is, just think a bit more about what she told you about her efforts to contact the other members of her government.  Is there anything else about that conversation that you remember now that could assist us? 
A.	I perfectly understand your intention, and all the information in that regard is important.  But on the strength of my memory and to jog my memory as much as I can, because that was a milestone conversation, the only name which, to my recollection, was mentioned was the name of Mr. Booh-Booh, as well as the name of Colonel Marchal of UNAMIR.  

I am sorry I do not have any further information about that telephone conversation because it was a conversation that took place in the middle of the night, and, as you would imagine, the context at the time was -- was quite tense in Bujumbura.  There were a number of people who had flocked to my residence believing that they would have more security.  And, as you'd understand, I had to deal with several competing concerns, and if I were able to contact the prime minister a little later -- and we all know why it was not possible -- I would certainly have had more detailed information.  
Q.	When you -- when you say, Mr. Witness, that "we all know why that was not possible", I'd appreciate it if you could tell us why.  "We all know that was not possible."  What are you referring to? 
A.	My attempt to have another telephone conversation around 6 o'clock in the morning on the 
7th of April -- actually, the telephone was not going through.  There was no number going through -- there was nobody picking up the phone.  Unfortunately -- and, as I said, what we all know is the murder of the prime minister at the time.  
Q.	Murder by soldiers of the Rwandan army; right? 
A.	To my knowledge, yes.  
Q.	Well, thank you for that information.  And it's not superfluous information in this case because there are Defence witnesses who claim, even in 2010, not to know who's responsible for killing the prime minister, so you can well appreciate why I'd like you to be specific on these points.  
A.	I understand your concern, Counsel.  What I can say is that the inf -- the clarification I have just mentioned is consistent with the information we had received from the embassy.  
Q.	When, if you could just clarify for the record, was this first information that you had received from your embassy? 
A.	Very candidly, on the basis of my recollection, I cannot say in the days and hours that followed -- I can say it's not to my recollection.  
Q.	But certainly within a day or two of the 7th of April? 
A.	I am unable to say so specifically.  Rather than venturing into assumptions, I'd rather say I do not remember, which is the truth.  I understand also your concern for specifics.  
Q.	Well, definitely before the 16th of April when you met Bicamumpaka at the state funeral.  
A.	Apparently.  
Q.	Now, you know that Bicamumpaka and the prime minister, Agathe Uwilingiyimana, were both members of the MDR; right? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	So it would be reasonable to expect that he would have had a special interest in what happened to her on the 7th of April.  Aside from being a minister of government, he was also in the same political party as the prime minister, who had been killed days before, when you met him on the 16th of April.  
A.	Since we both knew the prime minister very well, and he even better than myself, it goes without saying that we discussed this.  And be that as it may, I voiced my sadness at her death.  But saying specifically what transpired -- these were simply words of sadness.  That is what I was able to say -- or those are the words I was able to say.  
Q.	Thank you for your response.  All right.  Directing our attention to the 17th of April, when you had this breakfast meeting with Bicamumpaka, did he tell that the Rwandan army was in control of the situation on all fronts? 
A.	As far as I can remember, he told me on several occasions in the course of our conversation that he had just taken up his duties a few days earlier and that the interim government was -- had just been formed and that he was still trying to be briefed.  I do not feel -- and that is not my feeling here today -- that there were many -- that there was a lot of organisation and efficiency in that government a 
few days after it was formed.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, we're going to have to make a distinction between what your impressions were and your information from diverse sources were and what the specific individuals that I'm asking you about told you.  Because this question -- or the question I just asked and the next series of questions relates to what Bicamumpaka told you.  I'm not asking you about your impressions now.  

So I'll ask you again:  Did Bicamumpaka tell you that the Rwandan army was in control of the situation on all fronts? 
A.	No, not at all, because he was not in a position to say so.  
Q.	Why do we have that last tag to your response, "Because he was not in a position to say so"?  My question to you was direct, and what I'd appreciate is a direct response.  I want to know what he told you, not your assessment of him and of other information.  Did he tell you that the population rose up as one, which contributed to the safety -- which contributed to ensuring the safety of people and property in Kigali?  The population rising up as one?  
A.	I do not remember the wording of the -- we used in discussing the situation.  I am, therefore, not in a position to be positive about that.  However, what I can say for sure is that his prime concern as a newly appointed minister of foreign affairs was to -- as early as possible -- contact the authorities of the other countries, including Belgium, and that was a prime concern in the conversation he had with me for the purpose of taking the interim government out of isolation and also for that government to receive external assistance.  

And that was the main frame of our conversation.  And I fully reported that information on my -- in my reports.  Some were verbal reports as well as telephone reports and written reports, which are available in the records of the French community -- or the ministry in charge of the French-speaking community, to ensure that there is no misunderstanding.  
Q.	Did Bicamumpaka explain to you that there was no mutiny of the Presidential Guards and that the FAR was united?  Did he say anything to that effect to you in your conversation with him on the 17th of April? 
A.	No, I have no such recollection.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If I could have Mr. Issa assist me by handing this document up to the witness.  This is 
document number 5 in my bundle, which we have in English and in French.  It's the note verbale that I've been referring to of the 15th of April 1994.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you've seen this before because it was examined substantially in your cross-examination back on the 28th of January 2008, and it was admitted in evidence at that time in the Bicamumpaka trial.  And the last three suggestions -- or my last three questions to you about the substance of your conversation with Bicamumpaka really comes from what he himself wrote at paragraphs 19, 20 and 21 of this note verbale.  

So you can look at the sentences I've been reading from at paragraphs of 19 -- 19, 20 and 21.  And, at the same time, you can glance at paragraphs 24 and 28 through to 30, which are the paragraphs where he implicitly accuses Belgium -- or the government of Rwanda implicitly accuses Belgium of complicity with the RPF; of bringing heavy weapons into Rwanda to assist the RPF; of UNAMIR soldiers being complicit with the RPF at the airport, since they were responsible for the security of the airport.  

And what I'd suggest to you is that it's a bit surprising that these are the things that Bicamumpaka was saying to the international community on the 15th of April, but it seems to have been missing in your conversation with him.  
A.	I can provide a very simple answer to you, Mr. Prosecutor, because I am familiar with this document from the time of my testimony here in January.  I was not previously aware of this, and since then, I have not had any additional information on these matters.  So I believe that others may be more knowledgeable about these things than myself.  

My position then can only be consistent with what I said at the time; namely, that those who are concerned should be questioned as need be.  What we know, however, today is that there are various schools of thought on these issues, and mindful of my duties as the official representative of the French community of Belgium, I did not have jurisdiction in these matters.  So I am probably not the right person to whom you should be putting these questions.  
Q.	Well, that brings us to a point I was trying to make yesterday, Mr. Witness.  If you were not the right person to address issues of this nature, are you the right person to inform this Court about the political situation in Rwanda in April of 1994? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, there must be some confusion.  My testimony is in relation to what I know, what I saw, and what I was able to understand within the context of my mission and within the context of the humanitarian mission which we attempted to achieve along with other persons.  Those, unfortunately, are the boundaries of my testimony.  
Q.	In any case, let's look at paragraph 8 of the note verbale where Bicamumpaka says that same night, referring to the 6th to the 7th of April, "...Rwandans were bubbling with anxiety, especially in the neighbourhoods in town where violence had broken out to eliminate the RPF pillars commonly known as the Ibyitso." 

I think that's the only paragraph in this note verbale of approximately 33 paragraphs that could be considered a reference to the killings that took place from the 6th to the 7th of April.  Having looked over this document, would you agree? 
A.	I discovered it, and now I am reading through the document, but clearly, I have no comment to make in this connection.  The information available to me on the 7th did not, in any way, allow me to have a full understanding of the military situation as it unfolded in Kigali.  I did not have any direct information about that situation.  

I also believe that, in the days following, information available was extremely contradictory, whether it came from the media or from the various embassies.  I do recall that there was chaos after all, and that there was war.  
Q.	Well, thank you for that clarification.  But I'm talking about the 15th of April 1994 when this note was issued.  And this, I presume, is not contradictory or rumour-mongering -- referring to what's disclosed in this memorandum.  This is what the government was saying to the world -- or, more specifically, this is what they -- this is the information they circulated to the embassies around the world so that those embassies could represent the Rwandan position in their various locations.  

And the government was telling the world -- the Rwandan interim government, through Bicamumpaka, its minister of foreign affairs, was telling the world that Rwandans were bubbling with anxiety in trying to eliminate the pillars of the RPF known as the Ibyitso.  

I don't see any reference in this memorandum to the unfortunate killing of the prime minister, to the role of the Presidential Guards in killing the prime minister and other moderate politicians.  In fact, there's a defence of the Presidential Guards when at paragraph 21 Bicamumpaka tells the world that there was no mutiny within the Presidential Guard, that they are part and parcel of the FAR which remains united.  

Based on what you know today, you must admit that there are serious falsehoods contained in this document.  
A.	Yes, indeed.  Some significant information, which I became aware of belatedly, but if you want some clarification, let me also say that there is a contradiction between this note verbale and what Bicamumpaka told me in terms of his desire to negotiate with the RPF.  I heard that statement from him.  I did not hear what is contained in this note verbale.  So I have no comment to make, actually.  
Q.	So Bicamumpaka was saying one thing to you personally, but then telling something quite different to the rest of the world through this official diplomatic correspondence.  Is that what you're saying? 
A.	No.  I would like you to note exactly what I have said; namely, that I was not aware of this, that this had not been the subject of our meeting.  Our meeting focused on his desire to no longer be isolated and to have an opportunity to explain the situation to the rest of the world.  He said that it was the desire of his government to negotiate with the RPF.  Like many of us, I have read several writings and diverse narrations and points of view on these matters, but I cannot assert before this Court something that I do not know.  I am speaking under oath.  
Q.	Yes, Mr. Witness.  I can appreciate that.  But what you do know, and what you've basically already told us, is that Bicamumpaka was saying one thing to you but saying something quite different to the entire world and to the diplomatic community based on what you can now read in this note verbale of the 15th of April 1994.  It should be very easy for you to agree with that proposition.  
A.	I am not sure that I have understood your question, if it is a question at all.  
Q.	I don't think I need any further response.  
MR. WEBSTER:
What I request at this time is that the note verbale be admitted in evidence, both in the original French and the English translation.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
MR. MJUI:
The document will be P. 542, A for French, B for English.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
(Exhibit No. P. 542A and P. 542B admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Issa.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, even if you didn't know this back on the 17th of April, you've since learned that Belgium would not even permit a meeting with Bicamumpaka as minister of foreign affairs with members of its government when he sought an audience in Belgium shortly after you entertained him in your home.  
A.	Yes, I became aware of that later on.  
Q.	Later.  When? 
A.	I don't remember.  I don't have an exact recollection, so I don't want to just say anything.  
Q.	Did you become aware of this before you left Bujumbura in 1994?  "Left" meaning permanently leaving your posting in Bujumbura.  
A.	I left my position in July 1994.  And I may need to consult some documents which are still available to me to be able to put a more specific answer to you -- or provide, rather, a more specific answer to 
you.  I hope so.  
Q.	My only enquiry at this stage is whether you knew that Bicamumpaka had been refused an audience in Belgium prior to July of 1994. 
A.	Yes, I think I was aware of that.  But I don't know at what point in time, in any event, in relation to the official version.  
Q.	Now, you mentioned facilitating a telephone conversation between Bicamumpaka and Alain De Brouwer in your home on the 17th of April.  The reason why Bicamumpaka wanted to contact De Brouwer was because he expected the leadership of the Christian Democrat International to be in a position to facilitate matters for him in Belgium; isn't that so? 
A.	Yes, I think so.  
Q.	And that's because the CDI, Christian Democrat International, had some sort of cooperative relationship with some of the political parties in Rwanda, including the MRND and the MDR.  Is that an accurate statement, or would you rather clarify that for me? 
A.	That is correct.  But I was not very close to the CDI.  However, I knew that they had some affiliations and affinities.  
Q.	Affinities with who or what? 
A.	Affinities, clearly, with Mr. Alain Brouwer. 
Q.	Yes.  The CDI and Alain De Brouwer had affinities with who?  Who was the Rwandan -- their Rwandan counterpart?  That's what I'm trying to elicit from you.  
A.	Well, you have just mentioned it, Mr. Prosecutor, the MRND and the MDR.  
Q.	But you know today, as you testify, that even members of their fraternal supporters in the CDI were quite disappointed and critical of the interim government -- some of them, in any case, because of what they could perceive about the situation in Rwanda starting on the 7th of April, and particularly in light of Bicamumpaka's note verbale of the 15th of April.  That's true, isn't it? 
A.	You may want to be more specific as to who and as to what.  
Q.	Well, I'll make it easier for us by referring us to a document in my packet, document number 4, which you've certainly seen before because you were questioned about it in your cross-examination back on the 28th of January 2008.  

This is an excerpt from a book written by Léon Saur, S-A-U-R.  The book is entitled, 
Influences parallèles, or parallel influences, and the subtitle to the book is the international Christian democrat of Rwanda.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And if Mr. Issa could pass this document up to the witness.  I only have it in French.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And if you go to the second -- or, actually, the third page in of the excerpts that I've copied for you, and I'll mention for the record that I'm simply relying on the exhibit that was admitted in evidence in a previous trial.  I didn't have access to the entire book.  The book is described as addressing the 
issue of how and why the International Christian Democrat was able to support the Juvénal Habyarimana regime and the indications which are more and more evident that pushed Rwanda towards genocide.  

If I've incorrectly summarised what you read on that page, Mr. Witness, you can tell us.  But you should see where I'm referring to on the third page in, which is a copy of the back cover of the book describing its contents, and then I'll refer you to specific passages.  
A.	I read this book by Léon Saur, whom I knew very well at the time.  He was then the general secretary -- or should I say he was a member of the PSC, that is, the French socialist party and he was in charge of international relations as secretary general of that party.  I worked extensively with him before I went on mission, particularly when I was assigned to various ministries to deal with international issues.  

Now, upon reading this book, even before I became aware of this excerpt during my first appearance here as a witness, I was aware of Mr. Léon Saur's position.  I was also aware of the position of the IDC on this very issue.  

As I said in my first testimony here, I really do not have any comment to make on this matter.  I know that the two positions were contradictory.  I know that the IDC and Léon Saur were speaking at cross purposes.  Mr. Léon Saur had a theoretical experience in matters of international relations.  Alain Brouwer was -- De Brouwer was the African adviser on international affairs and was very familiar with the parties and individuals involved.  

So, as I said previously, within any given party and within any given political entity, even in Belgium, there are usually confrontations and disagreements, at least at the level of ideas, and this is an example of one such case.  So, you see, I am not in a position to make any commentaries about Belgian politics here, but I would do so if it were to make a contribution to this case.  

In any event, these are two opposing points of view.  Mr. Saur held a position at the time of writing this book which reflected the prevailing situation in which the responsibility, should I say, was highlighted in terms of the CDI's analysis of the ideas.  

Now, the CDI itself also held another position, and I believe that this discussion or debate is ongoing even to this date.  It is not over yet.  I know that we would not be sitting here in this Tribunal if matters had already been fully clarified.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, I can appreciate that you may not agree with -- with Mr. Saur -- with Léon Saur.  But what is clear from his book, or at least from the passages that I've excerpted -- that were excerpted in this exhibit is that he refused to -- or he was very critical of the interim government and of Bicamumpaka because, by his perception, the note verbale was inflammatory and inaccurate and because the interim government never clearly condemned the killings that were going on.  

Now, you can agree or disagree with those two points, but I believe that that's the sum and substance of what is excerpted here.  But what is important or -- or pertinent for this trial is what he says on page 94 in the middle of the page -- and I believe I've marked it there for you.  If you look at the excerpt where he says that neither the minister of foreign affairs nor any other member of the 
interim government was allowed to come to Belgium -- and he's relying on what the spokesperson of the Belgian ministry of foreign affairs was saying at the time.  And he places a date, the 28th of April.  

So by his account, in any case, by the 28th of April, it was clear -- or it was clearly the policy of Belgium not to have anything to do with the interim government.  I think it was before that, but he's saying at least by the 28th of April.  Do you have information that is any different?  
A.	Well, Mr. Prosecutor, in 2006 Mr. Verhofstadt, the Belgian prime minister, went to Kigali and asked for forgiveness or a pardon on behalf of the Belgian government for failing to come to the assistance of the country at that time.  What I mean is that, in matters of political responsibility -- or even the political analyses that were carried out at that time were actually incomplete.  

What is, however, certain is that the international community was passive, particularly Belgium -- and I'm sorry about that because Belgium is my country -- in view of the tragic events that unfolded in Rwanda.  Whatever the responsibilities may or may not be of the interim government, we ought to have intervened and we did not do so. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I didn't ask you anything about Belgium intervening or not intervening.  I asked you:  Did it come to your knowledge prior to the 28th of April that members of the interim government, and specifically Jérôme Bicamumpaka, were not allowed an audience in Belgium?  That's the only question I asked you.  

Do you have information to contradict what Léon Saur says in his book when he says that, by the 28th of April, it was clear, based on what the spokesperson for the Belgian ministry of foreign affairs was saying, that the interim government was persona non grata in Belgium?  
A.	Yes.  I became aware of that, yes.  Now, is that reason enough, Mr. Prosecutor, not to do anything? 
MR. WEBSTER:
If I could have this excerpt admitted into evidence as the next exhibit, please.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I am on my feet, and you would understand that I object to the tendering of that document into evidence.  

The witness has been extremely courteous by answering the questions posed by my learned colleague and giving him details about this publication.  And, as usual, it is an extract of a publication on a political analysis, and it would have been more opportune for the Prosecutor to call on Mr. Léon Saur to testify when he had the opportunity to call Prosecution witnesses.  And the practice in this Chamber regarding extracts of documents written by authors who are not appearing before the Court, if you were to admit this material into evidence, is simply to have it identified.  

It is not because it would have been -- or it had been admitted in the trial of Mr. Bicamumpaka that it has to be admitted, because it is not the same trial going on in this Court.  Because that would mean that they are the same events, the same facts.  And if that were the case, all such cases would be brought before you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, my recollection is that quite often we've admitted excerpts from books in evidence, particularly during cross-examination, and the Defence has admitted their fair share.  I didn't -- don't have a copy of the entire book.  I'm relying on the exhibit that was admitted into the Bicamumpaka trial.  But this witness gave a very lengthy response in which he detailed having read the book in its entirety and recalled this portion that was excerpt -- excerpted and admitted in evidence during his previous testimony.  

So I don't see that there's any unfairness in confronting him with it, since he's read the entire book and was able to comment on the book and on Mr. Saur, in particular.  So I don't see it as much of an issue of controversy to admit it.  The Chamber can admit it and disregard it if it's not important and leave the issue of weight for its deliberation.  But on admissibility I would suggest that there's no impediment.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We believe that a sufficient foundation has been laid for the admission of this exhibit, and we order its admission.  We admit it as evidence.  
MR. MJUI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  

The document will be P. 542.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I think the last exhibit was P. 542.  This should be P. 543.  

MR. MJUI:
Sorry.  I mean, 43.  P. 543.  

Thank you, Your Honour.  
	(Exhibit No. P. 543 admitted)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, you went to Murambi -- excuse me.  You went to Rwanda sometime between the 15th and the 17th of May 1994; right? 
A.	I'm sorry.  Yes, Counsel.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Mr. Issa, you can take my copy.  In fact, give me that one, and you can take these two.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And to do that you passed yourself off as a Swiss national to avoid problems on the roadblocks.  
A.	Do you need further details?  
Q.	If you think further details are important for your testimony, but I am simply trying to confirm with you as I move ahead in my examination that you went to Rwanda from the 15th to the 17th of May, and to do that you passed yourself off as a Swiss national, in fact -- in effect, hiding the fact that you were Belgian.  
A.	Now, I'd -- I'd need to give you a background which would need further specification by the representative of Cari -- Caritas.  Let me recall that this mission was organised by Caritas, so it was its call.  So Caritas had taken security measures, and when I got to the border, I learnt that there was a document.  I had my diplomatic passport with me, as I always do or did when I travelled to Rwanda, and there was a document that contained our three names and stating that we were Swiss nationals.  
It's as simple as that.  Because Mr. Antheunissens, who was the Caritas officer, believed that we would be more -- we would be safer under that cover.  

I did not paint the context to you, Counsel, and in the days that followed, the first weeks -- in the 
first weeks, rather, the Belgians were not -- the perception of Belgians was not very good.  And, subsequently, things were said in different terms and that is the reason I am not to blame.  Yeah, that's all I can say.  It didn't seem important to me.
Q.	Is it an expected procedure or a routine procedure for diplomats to pass themselves off as having another nationality when they go abroad on mission in known danger zones? 
A.	I do not have the slightest idea, Counsel.  And the circumstances at the time dictated my presence -- 
my -- well, accounted for that situation at the time.  And that is not a diplomatic practice, but the situation in Rwanda was dramatic and what mattered was to try and do something.  Perhaps we bordered on flouting diplomatic protocols.  But were there, at that time, any diplomatic decorum?  
Q.	So you do have the answer to the question.  It is not a routine or an expected procedure for diplomats to deny their nationality and pretend to have another nationality when they go abroad on mission, even if they're going into danger zones? 
A.	Counsel, may I say something to give you some clarification?  And as I stated in my previous testimony, I was wearing two caps.  I had a dual capacity.  I had to explain my dual capacity as I was a diplomat for the foreign affairs ministry.  I held a diplomatic status although I was not a trained diplomat.  And, also, I had the capacity as head of mission of the French -- francophone cooperation and -- which had nothing to do with the other one.  But be that as it may, I had to perform both duties.  And in that specific instance, I acted in the capacity of head of the francophone community.  

Does that clarify matters for you, Counsel? 
Q.	I think the matters were already clear, Mr. Witness, and I believe you've said so twice.  So I appreciate your -- your elaboration on your response, but the core of your answer is already on the record twice.  It was not an accepted or a routine procedure for a diplomat to hide his nationality when he goes abroad on mission, even if he goes into a known danger zone.  

You were removed from office or from your posting for that very reason, weren't you, because your trip to Rwanda to meet with the interim government in May of 1994 contravened Belgian policy at the time? 
A.	Undoubtedly.  But let me give some clarification.  On the one hand, I had not received specific instructions barring me from going to Rwanda because my status -- or my capacity was the head of the cooperation mission for the two countries and official representative in the two countries.  

And, therefore, that dual capacity -- for an unknown reason, I did not receive any instruction which I ought to have received in my capacity as head of mission in Bujumbura from the ambassador, and so there was nothing that prevented me from performing my duties.  From my authorities, I was not barred from going to Rwanda.  

Counsel, you might say that I was borderline or -- regarding my preserve, and I would say yes.  But I believed it was important to do something -- to try to do something, to try to understand, rather than being sheltered in Bujumbura and telling myself, "Let's wait and see what will happen."  But unfortunately, the events -- the parliamentary inquiries that took place in Belgium and in other locations and the apology of Belgium in 2006, I believe further testified to what I have been saying.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, I'm not in a position to know.  But I don't think your travelling to Rwanda would have been a problem if you had just gone to visit the camps of displaced persons, or if you had just gone to take a look around or if you had tried to provide some sort of humanitarian assistance to the victims.  

What I would suggest to you is that what was problematic about what you did was that you went and met with the interim government in Murambi, where they were headquartered, and engaged in conversations with a government that your government thought was criminal and illegitimate.  
Isn't that the issue? 
A.	It's much simpler than that, Counsel.  Let me say two things.  First of all, as I have said on several occasions, I did not organise the mission myself.  Confidently, I trusted Mr. Antheunissens who believed that it was desirable to meet the prime minister to try and push -- push things.  And I'm saying "to try".  

Secondly -- and that would be my answer to your previous question which I had not completed -- I got into trouble with the Belgian foreign authorities, that is, the embassy, which immediately considered my trip as unacceptable in the political circumstances of the time.  I, therefore, contacted the 
minister of foreign affairs who, in turn, decided to relieve me of my diplomatic status, and that was done in the days that followed.  

Yet my government, the government of the French community in Belgium, my minister wrote to the minister of foreign affairs of Belgian -- Belgium, rather, stating that it was unacceptable, and maintained his trust in me, and that is why I stayed in office until July 1994.  
Q.	Thank you -- thank you for your clarifications.  Now, with regard to this mission, in direct examination you told us that you had gotten as far as the outskirts of Kigali.  Can you tell us where exactly you had gone.  My assumption is that you travelled by road from Bujumbura, passing through Butare and Gitarama, and going beyond Murambi towards Kigali on the main road.  So give us an idea of how close you got to the city centre of Kigali itself.  
A.	We were on the hills in the south of Kigali -- in fact, on the top of the hills, and we were away from the fighting and from the explosions.  It was the first camp of displaced persons that was located after Kigali.  
Q.	So you were actually in Kigali? 
A.	No.  I do not think that was part of Kigali.  It was -- or it had nothing to do with the centre of Kigali or the inhabited area of Kigali.  We were on the hills, and that was quite a distance away.  And I think that is a question that should be directed to Mr. Antheunissens, who, as a former soldier, had specific coordinates about the location.  We were several kilometres, undoubtedly, from the centre of Kigali.  But I do not quite understand your question.  
(Pages 1 to 15 by Jean Baigent)








1015H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Didn't you cross the Nyabarongo river over a bridge that links Gitarama to Kigali? 
A.	No. 
Q.	So you were still in Gitarama when you were looking over into Kigali -- or over into the city; is that your evidence? 
A.	Yes.  To my recollection, yes, but I did not have a distinct recollection.   

But if you're talking about the river you cross before you get to Kigali, I would say it was before that river.  I believe that that information you can seek from elsewhere because I'm not in a position to say precisely where we were.  It's the first camp after Kigali in the direction of Gitarama. 
Q.	All right.  I'll simply accept your answer, Mr. Witness.  My impression was different but it's not an important point.  The impression I had was that, based on your evidence -- is that you'd actually entered the metropolitan region of Kigali and had crossed the river that divides Kigali from Gitarama.  But it's a minor point.

You met with Prime Minister Kambanda and other members of the government.  Can you remind us of whom you saw and spoke to from the interim government over those two or three days? 
A.	Let me recall that the visit to the government was very short.  We spent very little time there, at most half an hour.  And I met -- since you are enquiring about other dignitaries and other ministers of the interim government, as a matter of fact we met with the minister of health, and I've explained that I met him on the 30th of April in Bujumbura. 
Q.	Can you give us the name of the person you're identifying as the minister of health? 
A.	Jean de Dieu.  I'm not quite sure about his surname. 
Q.	The name you gave us in direct examination was Jean de Dieu Habineza with whom you had prepared this mission.  
A.	Yes, he's the person. 
Q.	Other than the prime minister, Kambanda, and the person I understand to be the minister of 
	social affairs, Jean de Dieu Habineza, who else did you meet? 
A.	Yes, correctly so.  I'd like to add that Dr. Rupoll -- actually I didn't meet him, but actually Dr. Rupoll met with the minister of health.  The minister I met was the minister of social affairs -- for the purpose of clarity, was the minister of health. 
Q.	Can you give us the name of the person you're identifying as the minister of health? 
A.	No, I do not know his name.  I did not meet him.  I met with the minister of social affairs.  If I referred to the minister of health, it's a mistake.  I did not meet him.  But Dr. Rupoll, who was the third person who went with us, met with the minister of health with whom he had had regular contact previously as 
	head of the medical corporation department of the embassy. 
Q.	Was that Casimir Bizimungu? 
A.	I believe so, yes. 
Q.	Did you or the other persons who were part of your mission party meet with any other officials of the interim government?  You've mentioned Kambanda, Casimir Bizimungu, and Jean de Dieu Habineza; was there anyone else? 
A.	No.  As I said in the first part of my testimony yesterday, when we met with Prime Minister Kambanda we were in a classroom and there were a number of going ins and going outs.  I do not know exactly who the persons were.  They might have been soldiers.  They might have been assistants.  I cannot say.  But I only met with the persons I have mentioned. 
Q.	How much time cumulatively did you spend at the training centre in Murambi?  I know you mentioned a meeting of 30 minutes with the prime minister, but just give us a global sense of the amount of time you actually spent on the complex of Murambi.  
A.	I believe it was less than an hour. 
Q.	So you did not reside or spend the night in Murambi; is that your evidence? 
A.	No, we spent the night at the dioceses -- actually at the seminary, as I have previously stated. 
Q.	And here you're referring to Kabgayi? 
A.	Correctly so, Counsel. 
Q.	There's evidence in this trial that a number of interim government personalities were also staying or resident at Kabgayi, including the minister of defence.  Did you have any interaction with any other member of the interim government on the premises of Kabgayi? 
A.	No, in Kabgayi we only met with the priest, the head of the episcopal conference, as I have stated, with whom we had dinner on the -- in the evening of the 15th.  We also met with priests.  We actually spent the evening with priests.  And apart from those persons, we did not meet any other person.  At the seminary we met the nuns where we were staying.  Surely -- 
Q.	When you were in Murambi was Mr. Antheunissens -- you have to pronounce his name for me -- was he with you and present for those meetings that you engaged in or those conversations that you engaged in? 
A.	Yes, obviously, because he was the mission leader.  He led our delegation. 
Q.	Did you see Mathieu Ngirumpatse at any time during that visit to Murambi? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Were you aware of his presence at Murambi?  In other words, did you hear from any other person that he was present at Murambi at the time when you were there? 
A.	No. 
Q.	And you made no effort yourself to contact him or try to locate him? 
A.	No. 
Q.	And as you testify before us today, the only conversation that you have had -- ever had with Mathieu Ngirumpatse was the one you described at his home -- taking place at his home on the 
	17th of August 1993? 
A.	No, Counsel.  Not at his home.  The meeting was organised by the chargé d'affaires of the 
	Belgian embassy and the first secretary, who went by the name of Philippe Colin, who organised a dinner. 
Q.	All right.  I'm sorry to cut you off.  I'm just trying to move ahead as quickly as possible.  
A.	It's okay.
Q.	The only time you had spoken to Mathieu Ngirumpatse was when you met with him on the 
	17th of August 1993? 
A.	Yes, correctly so. 
Q.	Now, going back to your meeting at Murambi with Kambanda and Habineza, you mentioned the presence of Dr. Rupoll.  Do you recall that Dr. Rupoll, in speaking to these members of the interim government, threatened them with having to face another Nuremburg?  "Threatened" used in a very generic sense, I'm -- not physically threaten them, of course.  

But didn't he tell them that based on what could be observed by the interim government that its leadership would face a trial like Nuremburg in the future? 
A.	As you are aware, I have already answered that question.  It's very simple.  Throughout that country we had lots of discussions among ourselves.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, we'd all do much better if you simply answered the question directly.  I'm conscious of the time and I would like to finish this morning.  So if you answer the question directly, it's more likely that I'll be able to do that.

Did you hear Dr. Rupoll threaten the interim government ministers with having to face another Nuremberg? 
A.	I do not think that these words were uttered in his presence.  Be that as it may, I do not remember it being said in that manner.  I believe that all three of us agree that those killings had to be stopped and that the government had to step in and take control of the situation, and that is what I can remember.  Otherwise, I do not know.  I can't remember. 
Q.	Well, let's have a look at how you answered this question back on the 28th of January 2008.  And here I refer to excerpt number 3 in my bundle, page 41 in the English text from lines 23-33, and in the 
	French text page 40 lines 45 -- excuse me.  In the French text page 42 lines 23-33.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And if Mr. Issa could hand this up to the witness, please.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And I've marked it there for you, Mr. Witness, so you could find it more easily. 

The question put to you in cross-examination is:  "Witness, did you hear Dr. Rupoll threaten ministers who were in Burundi that a new Nuremberg was going to occur?"  And your answer:  "I remember the discussions during that trip.  I have not read any notes about that because that was not the reason why I was convened.  But let me answer you sincerely, Prosecutor.  My state of mind, to use another expression, at that point in time was a question mark -- in fact, two or three question marks." 

And let me insert here, Mr. Witness, that you were being asked about whether you thought the 
interim government was responsible for the killings.  This is part of a longer series of questions addressing some of the same issues that we addressed together yesterday -- was whether the interim government was incompetent, was powerless or was deliberately pursuing a policy of massacring the civilian population.  

And to continue with your answer:  Your state of mind at the time was whether the interim government was powerless, question mark, incompetent, that I referred to that earlier, or actual responsibility of the government in the killings that were going on.  "I did not have at that time any precise background that would allow me to clearly come up with a credible hypothesis." 

So I'd suggest to you based on this response that, yes, Nuremberg was discussed and that your way of summarising -- or your way of informing a court of what you thought about the interim government back in 1994 was a bit different in January 2008 when you were testifying than it is or was yesterday.  Would you like to comment on that? 
A.	Certainly.  In this triple question, we should not lose sight of the question marks.  And those lingering questions are absolutely clear, which means that I did not have any answers to those questions.  And let me word it clearly, I may have used different words yesterday.  But I'm saying the same thing, and I believe that if you were to juxtapose the two transcripts of what I said yesterday and what I'm saying today with my testimony of the 28th of January substantially there is no difference.  A question cannot be an answer. 
MR. WEBSTER:
In any case, my suggestion, Your Honours, is that we simply admit this excerpt in evidence and then the Court may at a later time come back to it and see if the testimony on the 28th of January 2008 is, as I suggest, a departure from what the witness is saying today. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted. 
MR. MJUI:
The document will be P. 544.  

Thank you, Your Honours.
(Exhibit No. P. 544A and P. 544B admitted) 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, I see the time and I have two documents that I'd like to address with the witness.  I think I can do that in ten minutes or so and I would prefer to simply complete my examination by extending a bit into the break, but I'll follow the Court's -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You can complete it just with those two documents?
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, we are thinking of setting a stopwatch. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I'm sorry.  Mr. Ngirumpatse has a medical appointment at 10:30. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't mind breaking it up.  I was simply trying to suggest a convenient way of bringing this to a closure.  I don't mind stopping now and then taking 15 minutes when I come back. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Microphone not activated)...medical appointment.  We'll take our mid-morning recess now.
(Court recessed from 1034H to 1112H)  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, if I understand your evidence correctly, your position is that based on your direct experience, based on what you knew in your capacity as a diplomat back in April of 1994 and 
	May of 1994, that you can't really say whether the interim government intended the killings of 
	civilians -- intended the killings of the Tutsi, because they were deliberately inactive, or whether they were incompetent or whether they were simply powerless because of the anarchy; is that your evidence? 
A.	Counsel, allow me, first of all, to make a slight correction in respect of my testimony.  Earlier on, I 
	cross-checked during the recess for the purpose of specification regarding the question you put to me on my trip to Rwanda on the 15th and 16th of May 1994, slight correction, but which is essential as a matter of fact.  I used my diplomatic passport.  I have both immigration stamps on exit and on entrance.  And the Caritas list I mentioned, was a list that would be used if there were any difficulties in the course of the trip.  And I actually entered with my diplomatic passport.

Now, I'd like to answer your question. 
Q.	Before you go on to the question -- my question.  What I'd suggest to you is whether you used your diplomatic passport at the border to make the border crossing really isn't the substance of what I was addressing.  

What I was addressing was your decision to pass yourself off as a Swiss national as opposed to a Belgian diplomat so that you could -- so that your crossing any roadblocks within Rwanda would be less threatening to you personally.  And that hasn't changed simply because your diplomatic passport bears a stamp for the 15th of March -- excuse me, May 1994; right? 
A.	Counsel, let me recall that I stated that I had no initiative.  I made no decision about that list, which I discovered there, and then I did not take the decision myself to pose as a Swiss national.  

Be kind enough, Counsel, to repeat your question so that I will be in a position to also respond in specific terms. 
Q.	All right.  I appreciate your clarification, Mr. Witness.

My question to you is, if I -- I'm rephrasing your evidence and I'm giving you an opportunity to correct me if I'm wrong.  As I understand it now, based on your examination-in-chief and what we have covered in cross-examination, your testimony is that you don't really know whether the interim government was deliberately inactive and intending that the killings of Tutsi civilians would take place, or whether they were simply incompetent or whether they were simply overwhelmed because of the anarchy of the situation.  

That's my understanding of your evidence, where we stand right now, having gone through 
direct examination and cross-examination.  So you can correct me if I'm wrong in that appreciation.  
A.	Let me state once again that I had no point to assess the government's capacity or ability to take action.  Was it incompetence?  Was it powerlessness?  Or was there any responsibility borne by the government?  I was unable to make any such assessment.  Do you find my answer sufficient or clear?  
Q.	Not at all, because the last portion of your answer you said you didn't know if there was any responsibility on the part of the government.  And I didn't use the word "responsibility", I used the word "intention", because this Trial Chamber -- excuse me, this Tribunal has already found persons 
	legally responsible on the basis of various legal theories.  

But my suggestion to you is that you don't know whether the government intended the killings or whether they were incompetent or whether they were powerless.  
A.	Actually I believe in the chaotic situation that prevailed.  It was more of lawlessness and, yeah, anarchy which came to my mind.  And by the way, as I said in my initial testimony, in the transcript which you may not have seen yet, I do not believe that the government would have made such decision whatsoever in the circumstances. 
Q.	Do you think that someone like the minister of defence or the minister of information or the minister of higher education or the prime minister of the interim government would be in positions to speak more authoritatively on this subject?  More authoritatively than you in your limited capacity as diplomat in matters of social and cultural development? 
A.	I really did not understand the question.  Could you be more specific?  
Q.	You told us that your knowledge was limited by your limited exposure to the situation on the ground in Rwanda, which I can accept.  So I'm suggesting to you that someone like the army chief of staff, Augustin Bizimungu, or the minister of defence, Augustin Bizimana, or the minister of information, Niyitegeka, persons who were directly involved with the interim government, are certain to be able to speak more authoritatively on these issues.  You can agree to that proposition; can't you? 
A.	I agree.  I understand your question.  I understand your question, but my answer is I do not know. 
Q.	Well, I'd like to refer us to a report by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. José Ayala, based on a mission that he undertook to Rwanda slightly before your mission, Mr. Witness.  He went on the 11th to the 12th of May 1994.  

And this is a document that I had circulated previously.  But in his report, based on his mission to Rwanda around the same time as yours, he tells us that he met with the chef de cabinet in the ministry of defence, Mr. Bagosora, and with General Augustin Bizimungu, at paragraph 18 in that report.  

And then in paragraph 21, according to his report, General Bizimungu recognised the fact and expressed regret that massacres that had been committed by forces linked to the government -- that there had been massacres committed by forces linked by the government, which he termed as excesses or débordements.  
A.	So what's the question?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, could counsel direct the interpreters about the references?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry.  I don't think I have copies.  I gave copies of this particular document to the interpreters, but I can make one copy available now.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We're just asking that you give us a reference, Mr. Webster, please. 
MR. WEBSTER:
The reference is to paragraph 21 on page 8 where Mr. José Ayala reports Bizimungu, recognising to him and expressing regret that the massacres had been committed by forces linked to the government, which he termed as excesses or débordements. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, there's a problem with identification of the document. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I can -- these were -- this was -- this particular document was not in the bundle, Your Honour.  I have two other copies that Mr. Issa can hand up.  It was circulated by email, but the hard copies were never made -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Microphone not activated) 
MR. WEBSTER: 
	Mr. Issa is bringing it to you now.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we were looking at the wrong document. 
MR. WEBSTER:
If you turn to paragraph 21 on page 8, towards the lower half of the paragraph, a sentence beginning with "General Bizimungu".  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So my question to you, Mr. Witness, is:  Wouldn't General Bizimungu be in a better position than you to provide information of who was responsible? 
A.	If there were -- there was somebody to whom the question should be directed to is the 
	high commissioner, Mr. Bizimungu possibly, because I do not have any answers. 
Q.	All right.  Moving on.  You mentioned that you were in Kabgayi around the 15th of May, and had actually spent the night there.  And I'd like you to take a look at a news report from 
	The Times of London that was published on the 19th of May.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Issa could assist by handing a set to the witness and copies for the Bench.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	This is in English, Mr. Witness, but I assume you have -- it would help you to understand my question if you look at the text I'm referring to.  These are all -- three different pages, but the same text.  

You have three different copies to make it as legible as possible.  The last page is a reproduction of the article in The Times of London.  The next to the last page is a magnified version of the text and then the first two pages is the same text but as it was printed on the internet, which makes it easier to read.

And this is someone who is reporting on what he observed at Kabgayi.  And according to this journalist, if you look at the third paragraph down, he said that there were dead bodies in the mud, that the persons in the camp explained that the army and the militia would kill anyone who leaves the camp, that the prime minister -- the minister of primary and secondary education, Mr. Rwamakuba, was describing the militia as being disciplined.

And if you look at the next page at the top, there is a report of a Hutu head mistress of a local 
high school was complaining about the rape of her pupils and who was hacked to death.  
And this is taking place in Kabgayi, which is the place you visited and spent the night.  Does any of this sound familiar?  Or are these the type of things you heard being discussed, or that you yourself observed when you were at Kabgayi?  Kabgayi which is just a few kilometres down the road from Murambi where the interim government was headquartered.  
A.	It is The Times of the 14th of May 1994, but I did not hear about that either.  It was not mentioned in Kabgayi during my very short stay there.  It was not discussed with the priest I had met with those who accompanied me, neither was it discussed with or when we were at the seminary.  So I do not have an answer.  I do not know.  But it might be interesting to direct your questions at Mr. Antheunissens who had been there on several occasions and who perhaps has some answers for you, which, unfortunately, I do not have. 
Q.	Well, in regard to Mr. Antheunissens, is this another Belgian diplomat?  What is -- 
A.	No, not at all.  No, not at all.  Mr. Antheunissens is a former colonel of the Belgian army.  He served as coordinator for the Caritas missions in Burundi and Rwanda and his place of residence or station was Bujumbura, but he was not at all connected with the Belgian diplomacy.  It is an -- a Belgian NGO, and that was his specific duty. 
Q.	Thank you.  Getting back to this article, it reports an incident involving a head mistress at a school who was killed because she tried to prevent the rapes of her students.  You heard no mention of that incident when you were in Kabgayi, that particular incident?  Because, it's -- as I understand, it was quite notorious at the time.  This is a reference, I believe, to Madam Dorothée.  And we've had evidence in this trial from other witnesses about that particular incident, the killing of Madam Dorothée, because she tried to protect her students at the school of nursing.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, so far I have left the Prosecutor to conduct his cross-examination, but Mr. Ghiste has just said that he did not hear about that event, that it is not to his knowledge and that he's unaware of that newspaper report.  Why is the Prosecutor prompting him to speculate on these events?  It is not appropriate and it does not add anything to his case.

What's more, that did not obtain in my examination-in-chief.  So on several occasions attempts to prompt the witness to speculate have gone without my objection and I think this is over becoming and therefore I object to that line of questioning.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm not going to ask any more questions on this issue.  But I think the witness should be allowed to tell us whether the way I have put the issue to him now prompts any recollection on his part. 
THE WITNESS:
If you couch -- 

Thank you, Mr. President.

If you couch your questions in those terms, Mr. Prosecutor, I can give you some answer.  

Mr. Antheunissens talked to me about the murder of a Hutu sister or nun.  And he knows the details about that matter and it might be more timely for the questions relating to the death of that nurse to be put to him.  That might be more useful, Mr. Prosecutor.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  Thank you for that clarification.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And if Mr. Issa could assist me.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	This is the last issue I'm going to address.  Here I'm referring to another UN document.  It's a report of the -- to the Secretary General of the 31st of May 1994.  And this was based on a mission undertaken by Iqbal Riza to Rwanda just a few days after you completed your mission, Mr. Witness.  So you look at paragraph 3 in this document.

He talks about having visited Rwanda from the 22nd to the 27th of May 1994, of having spoken to Major General Augustin Bizimungu, a person he identifies as Major Augustin Bizimana but that suggests to you that he's referring to Ndindiliyimana, and to the prime minister Jean Kambanda.  

And if you turn your attention to paragraph 7, the first few sentences of paragraph 7.
MR. WEBSTER:
And give this to the interpreters if they don't have it.  I do have two extra copies, one in French and one in English.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Where Iqbal Riza is reporting that the special mission was informed that the killers included members of the Rwandan government forces, but in the main were drawn from the Presidential Guard and the Interahamwe, the youth militia recruited, and so on, by the late president's party.  The head of the interim government and the chiefs of staff of the Rwandese armed forces and the gendarmerie acknowledged that this was the case.  

And then if you turn to paragraph 30, Mr. Iqbal Riza is referring specifically on a conversation he had with Prime Minister Kambanda where at paragraph 30 he says:  "The head the interim government declared bluntly that the Arusha agreement rested on the fallacious premise that the tensions in Rwanda could be resolved by a political formula.  The problem" -- "the fundamental problem was ethnic, the historic animosity between the majority Hutu who in the past had been ruled by the minority Tutsi." 

So bearing these passages in mind, my question to you is:  Are these the type of things that 
Prime Minister Kambanda said to you when you met with him in Murambi, that it was the 
Presidential Guards and the Interahamwe that were doing the killing, and that the problem was not political, it was ethnic based on historical animosity between Tutsi and Hutu? 
A.	Let me start by telling you, Mr. Prosecutor, I have difficulty reading my copy of the document.  It was very poorly photocopied.  

Notwithstanding, I have understood the thrust of your question.  The minutes of our meeting, as well as notes that were taken down by various participants, the crux of our discussions is reflected.  And I have provided that material to you through a number of answers to questions you have put.  But now I have a document before me which I have just discovered -- and maybe I'm going too fast. 
Q.	If I could just interrupt you one second.  You mentioned minutes that were made available to who?  Or are you talking about the contents of minutes that you have reviewed prior to testifying?  Because we don't have any copies of your minutes, so if you could just clarify that for us.  
A.	Well, maybe I shouldn't have referred to minutes because that presumes that there are some official documents in place.  What I'm actually referring to is various notes that people may have jotted down, and which might be found in our archives here and there, which could help us to be more specific in what we are saying.  But maybe again I'm going too fast.  However -- 
Q.	It's not a question of going too fast.  I'm trying to find out if those notes are available to us, or if you have copies of them with you.  
A.	No, I don't.  Well, you see, I did not bring them with me. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  So now you can complete your answer in regard to what 
	Prime Minister Kambanda is supposed to have told Mr. Iqbal Riza, and whether he said the same types of things to you.
A.	I do not believe that I heard him say things in the same terms as are contained in the document which has just been placed before me.  I believe that it would be useful to put these questions to Mr. Antheunissens as well. 
Q.	Well, if it was true that the Presidential Guard and the Interahamwe were the ones that were most responsible for the killings, wouldn't you agree that persons who were responsible for the Interahamwe have some responsibility in regard to the crimes they committed? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I do not know who the leaders of the Interahamwe were.
(Pages 16 to 26 by Melissa Hook)






1145H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	I didn't ask you who they were.  I asked you:  If the Interahamwe were responsible, wouldn't their leaders be responsible?  
A.	Without being familiar with the details as to how things functioned at that level, it would be hazardous for me to venture into providing an answer for things that I do not know.  So, I am sorry, I can only answer regarding what I know, what I saw, what I can remember, and which reflects the reality of what transpired.  I cannot provide an answer to anything else, Mr. Prosecutor.  I cannot venture to interpret issues and put forth hypotheses about issues that I have no answers to.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you for your patience with me and for your answers, Mr. -- Mr. Witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I have no further questions of the witness.  I would, however, request that the two reports that I referred to, the report of Mr. Ayala Lasso from the 18th of May 1994, and the reports from Iqbal Riza, both be admitted in evidence.  

I have the Iqbal Riza report in French and English, and the Ayala report is only available in English at this time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
MR. MJUI:
The first document will be P. 545.  
MR. WEBSTER:
That would be the Ayala Lasso report of the 18th of May 1994.  
MR. MJUI:
Yes.  
(Exhibit No. P. 545 admitted) 
MR. MJUI:
And the second document would be P. 546.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And P. 546 is available in English and French.  Mr. Issa can take my copy in English and then the witness's copy for the French for the registry.  
(Exhibit No. P. 546A and P. 546B admitted) 
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  

Ms. Hounkpatin, do you have any redirect of this witness?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Yes, Mr. President.  But, as usual, I will be brief.  
RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Ghiste.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	I have a few questions for you.  

Yesterday when the cross-examined began, you were questioned about how frequently you visited Rwanda.  Could you tell us how often you went to Rwanda, on a monthly basis, to meet your teams that were working there from December 1992?  
A.	I can give you a global answer because I do not have with me the detailed scheduling of my visits.  I would need to consult my various reports to be able to come up with the specific dates.  But, in global terms, I can tell you that I went there quite regularly.  And because of my duties and responsibilities I had to meet several parties, or certainly persons.  

So what I would say is that, on average, I went there for a week each month.  And it could have happened that the mission would extend to about 15 days, but it could also have happened that I went for just three days.  So it was quite irregular.  But, on a broad scale, let me say that in the summer of 1993 it was a rather extended stay of about eight to -- or, rather, an extended stay.  But, on average, I went for about eight to ten days each month.  And, in any event, I received information on a daily basis.  
Q.	We insist on the frequency of your travels to Rwanda, as you would understand, because for someone who arrived there on 1 December 1992, and because of the events of 1994, as my learned colleague opposite has claimed, such a person may not know the country.  Do you have the feeling that you may not have fully grasped the event that happened during your stay, simply because you were not in Rwanda for extended periods?  Or, do you feel that you have a full understanding of the Rwandan situation?  
A.	This is not a quantitative issue, Counsel.  You see, it has nothing to do with my knowledge or knowledge of the country.  There were a number of contacts, including with those various ministers of the government, as well as contacts with technical cooperation staff who gathered information in their various places of work.  

And, as I specified clearly, part of my mission was spent at the Belgian embassy in Kigali.  Johan Swinnen, the ambassador, and his collaborators obviously briefed me on a number of issues.  So clearly I think that I was not under-informed when it comes to developments and the situation, if that is the thrust of your question.  
But let me say that before permanently being assigned to Rwanda, I had been on three previous missions to Rwanda, and over several years I had already been in charge of relations with Rwanda when I worked under a number of ministers in the government of my country.  So I was already closely monitoring developments in that part of the world, in particular.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ghiste.  You told me, and you repeated during your cross-examination, that from the 15th to the 17th of May you travelled to Rwanda, particularly to Gitarama, at the behest of the interim government.  Can you confirm that?  
A.	Let me be more specific again, Counsel.  Through Caritas, who were the organisers and the negotiators of that specific mission, yes, indeed, when the minister of social affairs visited, I met him in Bujumbura on the 30th of April in the evening.  And, at that time, the interim government clearly expressed such a desire through the minister of social affairs.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ghiste.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. Issa, would you please kindly assist in distributing the following documents. 

These documents are for the parties, for the Judges, and a copy for Mr. Ghiste.  

I do not know whether Issa has enough copies for the interpreters. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Ghiste, you told us -- or, rather, you told Mr. Webster during cross-examination that Mr. Bicamumpaka had told you that it was the desire of the interim government to enter into negotiations with the RPF.  Can you confirm that?  
A.	Yes, of course.  
Q.	In that discussion did you delve further into the matter, and did he tell you what the RPF's position was in relation to that expressed desire?  
A.	Well, I must think about this because -- um... it would appear that there was some resistance on the part of the RPF, but I am not in a position to provide you with any further details on that matter.  
Q.	Very well.  The document before you which has now been distributed was disclosed to us by the Prosecutor.  From Kigali, 18th April 1994, from the ministry of defence, the general headquarters of the Rwandan army.  And it is addressed to Mr. Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh, special representative of the United Nations Secretary General to Rwanda.  The letter is signed by Gatsinzi, Marcel, that is, at the end of the three paragraphs which make up that letter.  Signed by General Gatsinzi, Marcel.  

There is an appendix to the letter bearing the date of 14th April 1994 -- rather, 17th April 1994.  And as you can see it contains a number of paragraphs numbered accordingly, as appear on the document.  

The cover letter is part of the document, and I would like you to read the two paragraphs, the two introductory paragraphs of that letter, please, starting with the addressee and ending at "broad-based", please.  
A.	Are you referring to the appendix or the first page?  
Q.	The first page, please.  That is the letter to Mr. Booh-Booh.  
A.	I am there.  
Q.	Are you -- have you found the first -- the first paragraph of that letter?  
A.	Yes, yes, I am there.  
Q.	Please, kindly read those two paragraphs for the benefit of the Trial Chamber.  
A.	Aloud, please?  
Q.	Yes.  
A.	"Within the framework of a quest for ways and means for peace to return to Rwanda" -- I hope I am not going too fast for the interpreters -- "I have the honour to transmit or to forward to you as an appendix the proposal from the Rwandan armed forces, which also serve as an answer to the preconditions laid forth by the Rwandan Patriotic Front regarding negotiations for a ceasefire."  End of first paragraph.  

"These proposals are presented in order of priority.  Some of the actions to be undertaken have already been initiated.  Others will be undertaken by the broad-based transitional government, with a view to enabling the two negotiating parties to jointly participate in their implementation.  The benefit therefrom would be the creation of an atmosphere of confidence arising from this transparency, following a commitment by the two parties to these actions.  Finally, joint actions (FAR, RPF, and UNAMIR) need to be undertaken in order to monitor or control the implementation of documents -- of decisions taken by the broad-based transitional government."  
Q.	Thank you.  Now I would like you to turn to the second sheet, the appendix, and please read point number 1, that is, "The framework for restoring peace in Rwanda."  "The framework for restoring peace in Rwanda," number 1.  Please read aloud.  
A.	"Stop and cause to be stopped the massacres committed by one or the other party on the national territory."  Then there is a word which I cannot read.  (French spoken), it must be.  "One or the other party."  "In order to achieve this goal, the following shall apply to both parties:  

"A.  Stop the fighting so that the forces of law and order can become available for the purposes of pacification.  

"B.  Undertake a pacification campaign through the public and private media, and this should be done by administrative and political authorities.  Nota bene:  In this connection the national broadcasting corporation and RTLM have already been contacted and they have promised to use pacifying and moderate language.  Radio Muhabura should do the same.  

"C.  Undertake awareness-building tours -- or, administrative and political authorities should undertake awareness-building or sensitisation tours.  

"D. Call on the international community to provide urgent humanitarian assistance, particularly by the provision of food supplies, clothing, and health services to the most significantly affected persons (namely, displaced persons and wounded persons across the country)."  End of first paragraph. 
Q.	Mr. Ghiste, since you are a good reader, please continue to the second and third points so as to complete that annex.  
A.	I didn't know I had to go through a reading exercise.  
Q.	I had to first of all put you through a test, and you passed well.  
A.	"2.  Establishment of the transitional broad-based government.  Some actions fall under the purview of the broad-based transitional government (including the two parties).  Among others, prosecution of all those found guilty of killings and other crimes.  This would ensure transparency in the implementation of the decisions taken.  

"3.  Combined actions to be undertaken:  

"A.  Makes patrols of the RFA, RPF, and UNAMIR.  

"B.  Judicial and/or administrative inquiries into the assassination of the two heads of state (Habyarimana, Juvénal, of Rwanda, and Ntaryamira, Cyprien, of Burundi) and their delegations on the 6th of April 1994, on the killings that ensued, on all the other events that followed.  

"C.  Control of radio broadcast.  

"D.  Collection of weapons -- illegally held weapons, rather."  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ghiste.  After reading this document, what comments do you have about it?  
A.	Obviously I was not privy to this document, so I have just learnt about it with everyone else.  I have two thoughts.  

This document -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Rather, the witness said, his thought on the document is that:  
THE WITNESS:
It is a remarkable document.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Well, his second thought -- 
THE WITNESS:
My second thought on this document is:  Who could have been privy to the document apart from Mr. Booh-Booh?  

Point 1D in the annex, which calls on the international community for emergency humanitarian assistance, seems to be consistent with the request that was tabled before the minister of social affairs, and previously in the course of the meeting I had with Mr. Bicamumpaka.  

Those are the comments I have to make on this document, off the cuff.  But, then, what became of those recommendations of these intentions?  In practice, it begs for some questions.  So it is tantamount to saying what I have said on several occasions during my previous testimony, and on the -- on this occasion:  Was there indeed the ability to enforce what has been very brilliantly set out in this document?  Once again, it begs the question.  Obviously the events seem to have given an answer, and the answer, to me, on hindsight, is no.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	But, Mr. Ghiste, previously you answered to my question about whether the RPF had agreed or had given its view on these talks.  What was Mr. Bicamumpaka's opinion on these talks?  I would like to know what your answer -- the answer you gave was.  Was it a positive answer?  Was it a negative answer?  
A.	I would say two things.  The first is that the intention expressed by Mr. Bicamumpaka on behalf of the government was the expectation of a positive response from the RPF.  But I believe that there was no positive response, and that was restated during our visit in May by Mr. Jean Kambanda.  

However, the intention -- and I am coming back to my conversation with Mr. Bicamumpaka -- on that day was that the international community had to bring pressure to bear on the RPF.  There was no way out without negotiation, and that also was what I believed.  
Q.	My last question is the following:  On the strength of this document -- which has already been admitted into evidence in this trial and in another trial.  It is D. NZ544.  On the basis of this document -- and there are many others -- to avoid keeping you any further in this courtroom, can we agree that the interim government was seeking solutions, was striving for talks?  
A.	Through Mr. Bicamumpaka and through the minister of social affairs, yes.  But that does not give me a personal answer.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ghiste.  I am done with my re-examination.  Thank you for enduring our questions patiently, and for also giving us your answers.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, at the end of this testimony I would like to make our usual request, namely, that the witness be allowed to meet with Mr. Ngirumpatse.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Hounkpatin.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, if I could interrupt for one second.  This is a new document that was placed in front of the witness for redirect.  And if I could just ask two or three questions on it; it would be very brief. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission granted.  
MR. WEBSTER:
First I would like to indicate that I agree with Madam Hounkpatin that it is already in evidence, but the copy that we have in evidence is not very legible.  So I would suggest that we take her copy, which is a different K number and just completely clean, and simply append it to what we have in evidence as D. NZ544.  That way we would have the original document plus one that is also -- that is more legible.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We would also direct that that be done.  
FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, looking at the document, at the bottom you see the signature of Marcel Gatsinzi, right?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And he signs it as général de brigade and as the acting chief of the armed forces.  Right?  
A.	That is what I can read, and that is correct, Counsel.  
Q.	And the document is dated the 17th of April 1994 at the top; you see? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Would it surprise you to learn that on the 16th of April 1994 the interim government met in a cabinet meeting and removed -- or, simply, rather replaced Marcel Gatsinzi as the chief of staff of the army?  Did you know that?  
A.	No. 
Q.	Well, there's evidence in this case, and I believe it even comes from the Defence, that on the 16th -- also from the Defence that, on the 16th of April, the cabinet met and replaced -- or, installed a new permanent army chief of staff.  With that in mind, wouldn't you agree that it appears that Marcel Gatsinzi wrote this letter on the 17th before he was informed that he had been removed?  
A.	I hope you do not expect me to speculate at all.  
Q.	No, I'm asking you to use your powers of reasoning, and join me in reflecting on what seems to be apparent, which is a letter signed by the acting chief of staff on the 17th of April must have been written before the acting chief of staff learned that he had been removed the day before.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, before the witness's answer, I do not understand the purpose of the Prosecutor's game.  Does he have a document stating that Marcel Gatsinzi said, "I did not sign or write this letter"?  This letter has not been disclosed.  What game is he trying to lead the witness into?  It is not correct.  We have a document in evidence that refutes what he is stating, that Marcel Gatsinzi had been subsequently relieved from his duties or removed from that office.  Regardless, it is a fact, you cannot split the administration of a country at the whim of the Prosecutor.  

I object to that line of questioning that prompts the witness to speculate, in addition to the fact that facts are completely mistaken, or wrong.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, I think that there's been testimony from several witnesses, I can even provide the references to the Court and the Defence after lunch. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's not necessary at this stage, Mr. Webster.  That's a matter which we will address during our deliberations and the assessment of the weight of the testimony.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, if I can have an answer from you:  That a letter signed by a person identifying himself as the acting chief of staff on the 17th of April would logically have been written in circumstances where the author of the letter didn't even know he had been removed the day before.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, really, that also is a matter which we should address for ourselves when we are deliberating on the weight to attach to the evidence.  
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.  Well, one last question.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, the position of the Prosecution is that Marcel Gatsinzi was removed as the acting chief of staff precisely because he was making successful efforts to negotiate a ceasefire.  Bearing that in mind, do you have any further recollection on this letter, which seems to be a positive move forward in negotiating a ceasefire?  Bearing in mind that the Prosecution's position is that Mr. Gatsinzi was removed for that very reason.  
A.	I am ready to answer, but concisely, because I do not see his -- the relevance of this date, whether it be on the 16th or on the 17th, for the person who relieved him of his duty or who wrote this document.  And, if I understood you correctly, that person should have a hidden agenda.  And if that is the case, I have no speculation to make because I do not understand why this letter should have been left to stand.  On the contrary, this letter had to be expunged.  If it became embarrassing to the government, this document should have gone under wraps, it should have been made to disappear.  And obviously I do not know.  And that is pure speculation.  
Q.	All right; thank you for answering my questions.  

MR. WEBSTER:
I've completed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, this concludes your testimony before the Tribunal -- for the Tribunal in this case.  We thank you, as we do all witnesses, for assisting us in our work.  You are now excused and you are free to leave.  The registrar will put in place the necessary steps to facilitate the request made by counsel.  

You may leave.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I would like to thank each and every one of you, the Prosecution, the Defence, and all the other persons in this courtroom for -- if you would allow me to say that my sole concern is to strive to make a modest contribution to your work, and I understand that your task is hard and difficult, and I wish you the best in your future endeavour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Before we take the luncheon adjournment, I would just like to announce that we are going to have a change of courtroom tomorrow and Thursday.  We will be sitting in courtroom 3.  This will be to facilitate the use of this courtroom by the Appeals Chamber, who will be using it tomorrow and Thursday.  

We -- Ms. Hounkpatin, we can take our luncheon adjournment now, and allow you to start your next witness after lunch.

(Court resumed at 1410H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.  

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you give your testimony, you have to take an oath to tell the truth.  And the registrar will now assist you to do that. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, please.  Mr. President, I thought you had been informed yesterday that this witness will be testifying in his own name, that is, unprotected.  He had signed a document by WVSS confirming that he would like to have the order you made, the order protecting him, lifted.  If that has not been done, I am reconfirming his wish to testify as an unprotected witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Mr. Witness, the Chamber had made an order for your protection on the application of the Defence for security reasons.  Counsel has now informed us that it is no longer necessary and that you wish the protective measures we made to be revoked such that you will be testifying openly.  Is that your position?  
THE WITNESS:
That is indeed my position, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you testified in any other cases before in this Tribunal?  
THE WITNESS:
No.  Never, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
In that case, we will revoke the protection order made in your favour.
(Declaration made by Paul Antheunissens in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Mr. Witness, you will now give your testimony by responding to the questions put to you by counsel for Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
THE WITNESS:
Very well, Mr. President. 

MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Once more, good afternoon, Mr. President.  Good afternoon to everyone.
PAUL ANTHEUNISSENS,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Antheunissens.  You have before you a document, I believe, or otherwise Mr. Issa would hand you the document.  That is your personal information sheet.  On that sheet you have your name as Paul Antheunissens.  I will spell it, A-N-T-H-E-U-N-I-S-S-E-N-S.  

You also have other civil status information concerning you on that form.  I would like you to check it and see whether there is no error.  If there is no other error, please sign and date the document so that it could be put in evidence.  
A.	Could you remind me of the date today, please.  
Q.	Today is the 19th of October 2010.  

Have you dated and signed the document? 
A.	Yes, I have done so.
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. Issa would collect the document. 

Mr. President, I would now request you to kindly admit this document into evidence, and it will be document D. NG137.  I stand to be corrected by Mr. Issa as regards the number of the exhibit. 
MR. MJUI:
The exhibit number is D. NG136 (sic). 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Admitted.

MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. Issa. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Antheunissens, we will begin your examination.  And before delving into the subject matter, there are always some preliminaries that we go through.  These -- or, rather, in an international court like this one, there are interpreters who listen to the questions and answers.  You speak French; I also speak French.  Therefore, to allow for the interpretation or, rather, the proper recording of my questions, please pause after my question before starting your answer.  I will try to do the same.  At the end of your answer, I will pause before asking another question.  
A.	Very well. 
Q.	Another preliminary, I would like you to speak slowly.  I understand that you have a clear voice.  There is no difficulty with that.  

Furthermore, if you are mentioning a proper noun, please kindly spell it for the purposes of our records.  That will also be helpful.  Thank you.  

Mr. Antheunissens, can you briefly remind the Court your professional background.  
A.	I did a military career which stretched from 1954, the year when I entered the royal military school of Brussels, to 1992, the year when I was retired.  I retired with the rank of lieutenant colonel of the headquarters general staff.  I served in the infantry and the paracommando units.  And very early in my career, the humanitarian aspect came to join with strictly military activities in my career. 

I will give two examples.  In 1960 I was, first of all, in the Congo and then in Burundi with a unit called unité de marche following the events leading to the decolonisation of the Congo. 

Also in 1964, with my battalion, the first parachute, paratroopers battalion, we had to jump in order to free hostages whose lives were threatened by Simba rebels in the eastern province of the Congo.  The name of that operation is very typical.  It was called "Humanitarian Operation Stand Police".  

In 1980 I commanded a battalion, an infantry -- mechanised infantry battalion.  And after that I served in a major general headquarters staff unit.  To be more precise, SHAPE.  SHAPE is the supreme command headquarters of the allied forces in Europe.  It is located in Belgium in Casteau near Mons. 

At the end of my career, I was posted to Prussia to -- in an attempt to avoid incidents or prevent incidents between the Yugoslavian army and the Croatian parties that wanted independence.  The mission was to bring about a ceasefire, and the ceasefire was more or less long.  

Later on it became necessary to have a serious military intervention in order to achieve our goals.  So this is what I will have to say regarding my career. 

After I went on retirement, I served for some time at the international union of public transport, the secretariat general of which is located in Brussels.  In that international transport union, you have managers of public transport units everywhere in the world. 
JUDGE KAM:
Counsel, can you ask your witness to spell some proper nouns, some names he has just mentioned. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Yes, Your Honour.  I have noted some words.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	First of all, the general headquarters of SHAPE.  Can you spell SHAPE, please.  
A.	SHAPE is an English acronym.  It is Supreme Headquarters of Allied Powers in Europe.  So literally, it is the general headquarters, the supreme headquarters of allied forces in Europe.  It is a headquarters that is -- or that comes immediately under the authority of NATO. 
Q.	Mr. Antheunissens, I would like to you spell that word.  Can you -- 
A.	I will spell it.  S-H-A-P-E.  
Q.	Thank you.  Can you now spell Mons.  
A.	Mons, I believe, is M-O-N-S. 
Q.	Yes, you are correct.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Your Honour, I do not know whether there are other words that you would like to see spelt. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Casteau? 
A.	I am going to spell Casteau.  I will spell it in a system approved by NATO.  Charlie, Alpha, Sierra, Tango, Echo, Alpha, Uniform.  Casteau. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Antheunissens.  
A.	So I was talking of the international union of public transport systems.  The members of that union together tried to define the technical requirements for equipment needed for public transportation and the standards of using such equipment.  In that context I was in charge of a project financed by the European Union.  In fact, it was in synergy, it was in collaboration with European towns, towns in 
	North Africa and Istanbul. 

After that I was appointed by Caritas as coordinator of Caritas in Burundi.  I arrived there around the 20th of March 1994. 

I believe that brings to an end my career background. 
Q.	That is correct, Mr. Antheunissens.  

Can you tell us why Caritas appointed a retired soldier, a retired military officer to serve it?  And is it the practice in this type of organisation to use soldiers? 
A.	You should bear in mind that Caritas, or Caritas organisations in general, are some sort -- are kinds of NGOs which try to put some rationale in the use or distribution of humanitarian aid.  When they need reinforcement, the fact of approaching officers in Belgium is perfectly normal, if one remembers that among the officers you have many of them who are Catholics, if you also remember that when those officers are retired, they still feel they are in a position to serve.  

I would add the following:  There are Caritas units in practically all countries, and their tradition is Catholic.  But in the Belgium Caritas there is a special section which is called "Secours International", international relief.  That section or unit must coordinate the activities of the various Caritas in the event of a misfortune or a disaster, catastrophe somewhere.  And if need be, they have to contact -- 
Q.	Mr. Antheunissens, please, can you slow down so that everything should be translated.
A.	Yes.  You are entirely right.
	
	So as I was saying, international relief -- or after seeking the cooperation of sister Caritas bodies, for example, Catholic relief operations in France where the CRS, the American CRS -- CRS means Catholic Relief Services.  So after seeking their cooperation, international relief efforts can focus towards the international Caritas body located in Rome and action may be sought for the objective to be attained.  This is what happened in the case of Rwanda. 

There was an appeal by the international Caritas body, and the funds made available were used for financing the international humanitarian aid in Bukavu and Goma camps. 

Have I answered your question?  
Q.	Yes, entirely.  And if you could pause before I ask my next question.  

Let us spell out Catholic Relief Services.  
A.	C-A-T-H-O-L-I-C, R-E-L-I-E-F, and services. 
Q.	I will spell it out slowly for the benefit of the French reporter, basically:  Catholic Relief Services. 

Now, Mr. Antheunissens, when you arrived in Burundi, could you tell the Court what your mission to Burundi was.  
A.	My mission was organised following the problems of October 1990 when President Ndadaye was assassinated.  There were killings and many, many people were displaced, and there were several refugees as well. 

The international organisations only started their missions in December, particularly the World Food Programme, which required that distribution be conducted in an impartial manner. 

Regarding distribution, it was impossible to proceed without involving the church.  The church had 
ten dioceses and was, therefore, in a good position to handle the distribution exercise.  However, the members of the church were mainly Tutsi, and Caritas Burundi was made up of Tutsis exclusively.  
Now, according to the World Food Programme, people who were able to kill their president would also be able to bring famine upon the people.  So, therefore, they were concerned about the manner in which the distribution would take place. 

The system that was put in place was rather bogus.  The CRS, that is, Catholic Relief Services, worked with the local Caritas organisation to set up a distribution centre in each of the dioceses.  They provided training for distribution staff.  They controlled the distribution lists, and they guaranteed a fair and equitable distribution as was requested. 

For this to happen, it was necessary for Caritas Burundi to have an impartial person on their staff, namely, an expatriate, who at that level would ensure that the distribution exercise was conducted properly.  I was not the first to hold that office in Caritas Burundi.  My predecessor was Jean Legrand, who had been there since December.  At that time he had set up a proper distribution system in collaboration with CRS. 

When I got there in March, I simply continued to execute what he had already laid down.  And that was the first part of my mission. 

Am I going too fast?  

Now, the second part of my mission entailed coordinating the various projects that had been granted by Belgium to Caritas Burundi either through international relief or by AGCD. 

Well, let me not bother you with that acronym.  It no longer exists, but it was simply at the time a cooperation and development organisation which granted a number of projects as well, and some of which were granted to Caritas.  So I had a double function, first of all, in relation to international organisations, to ensure that Caritas worked under absolutely fair and equitable conditions; and then, secondly, to provide coordination for projects from Belgium. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Antheunissens.  Can you tell us whether at that time there was a Caritas Rwanda organisation.  
A.	Well, before those events, Caritas Rwanda was already in place.  It was very busy with humanitarian assistance to persons in various displaced-persons camps. 

You know that the war had been ongoing since 1990, and people had been driven out of Ruhengeri and Byumba, so much so that about a million displaced persons had been moved on.  It is in that context that Caritas and the World Food Programme, as well as other international assistance organisations, were working to provide relief -- health relief and other forms of relief to those displaced persons. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court who was in charge of Caritas Rwanda at the time.  And did you have opportunity to work with Caritas Rwanda before the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	The head of Caritas Rwanda was a white Father, Father Dechombes.  D-E-C-H-O-M-T-E-S (sic), Dechombes.  So when I arrived in Rwanda through Kigali, I got -- I had the opportunity to greet Father Dechombes and his team. 

Let me say that this team was completely decimated during the events of the 6th of April.  Father Dechombes was able to hide, and a few days after made his way to Europe. 

The local collaborators of Caritas Rwanda were mostly killed.  Most of them were killed along with their families. 
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Antheunissens, how did you learn about the attack on the plane carrying the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi on the 6th of April?  And where were you and in what circumstances did you receive the information about that attack on the plane? 
A.	At that time I was in Ruyigi, R-U-Y-I-G-I.  Ruyigi is in the south-east of Burundi.  I had spent the night there having been hosted by a Dutch -- or a German couple -- Ott, O-T-T -- who were in charge of the BDDO (sic).  In each diocese there was an office for development known as the BDD. 

Now, when it came to distribution of food supplies, the PAM, or the WFP, used the BRD as the acronym for the BDD, the distribution of relief.  So I met Father Ott at the bishopric, and they proceeded to do this job properly. 

Now, by chance, during the night he had listened to an international radio station.  And at around midnight he got me up from sleep.  He woke me up.  I was with Legrand.  And he told us about the bringing down of the plane and the death of the two presidents.  So we decided to return to Bujumbura early in the morning at 6 a.m. 
(Pages 36 to 42 by Joe Reynosa)











1445H 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Thank you.  So you returned to Bujumbura at 6 a.m. on the 7th of April; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	What was the atmosphere in Bujumbura like, and what reactions were you able to observe? 
A.	People were very worried, particularly Tutsis who were afraid that Hutus would again do what they had done when President Ndadaye was assassinated, namely, to use their machetes to attack everybody.  So the army was put on alert and deployed in additional -- at additional roadblocks.  

So at Caritas Burundi we had what one could refer to as first-hand information, because Dr. Françoise was the doctor and her husband was a lieutenant at the parachute battalion.  So we knew first-hand that there was a general alert in place. 
Q.	During that day, that is, on the 7th of April, did you receive information on the events that were unfolding in Rwanda?  And if yes, what did you learn? 
A.	We received information, like everyone else, through the mass media, radio and television.  In the beginning the information was rather fragmentary.  But we had contacts with the white Fathers in Bujumbura who were in possession of more information relating to the killings that had begun. 
Q.	Mr. Antheunissens, were you informed of the murder of the prime minister and other figures of authority in Rwanda?  And if so, on -- in what conditions and at what time? 
A.	Well, I received the information in the evening.  And at that time I was with the white Fathers in Bujumbura.  And it was through the media that we found out about those killings, those murders. 
Q.	Were you informed of the killing of Belgian soldiers?  And if so, please, could you tell us the type of information you received about that serious incident.  
A.	Allow me, first of all, to say that, when I arrived in the area around the 20th of March, I travelled in a military plane with part of the commando detachment -- part of the second battalion of the 
	commando detachment which was coming to take over from the second mission of the parachute troops that were returning to Belgium.  

So in that capacity I got to know some of the officers, and I even had some discussions with the chaplain, who was coming along with radio set or transmitter, which he had previously used in Somalia for motivating staff and also civilians.  At the time he actually knew that the civilian population in Kigali was not exactly friendly to Belgians.  

I also had a Lieutenant Lotin with me, a young officer with whom I had some discussions and who had recently joined the battalion and who had been given command over the artillery squad.  So, for sentimental reasons, learning about those killings, particularly the killing of Lotin, was, rather, quite painful. 
Q.	As the events unfolded in Rwanda, I -- I would like you to continue to provide information to the Court on some key points.  Did you follow the formation of the interim government, or were you not aware of it? 
A.	Well, I told you that I used to live with the white Fathers.  And so we discussed these issues, and we were aware of them.  But it took another two days or so, that is, around the 10th of April, for 
	the mass media and TV news and Radio France to begin to talk about that government. 
Q.	From the information you were able to gather relating to the appointment of the interim government, was it possible for you to determine whether or not the situation was stable? 
A.	No.  The situation was not stable at all.  The RPF had attacked on the 7th or the 8th, and it was clear that if the strategy of the RPF was to capture Kigali it would not be possible to have a legitimate 
	interim government, except, miraculously, the RPF turned around and agreed to engage in peace negotiations.  

And by the way, the RPF attack was contrary to the spirit of the Arusha Accords, which had set up a buffer zone.  And by crossing that buffer zone, the RPF had clearly breached and violated the Arusha Accords. 
Q.	In what circumstances did you become aware of the departure of the Belgian contingent and the 
	foreign intervention forces? 
A.	We learnt of the departure of the Belgian contingent around the 11th of April.  And, of course, that piece of information was a point of consternation for Belgians, because it became obvious that the only unit that would have had the capacity to restore order in Kigali had left.  

Subsequently, we also learnt that expatriates had been evacuated by a number of detachments.  One of them was Belgian, while the paracommando unit was called back because the United Nations did not allow the battalion on the spot to take charge of that mission.  

There was a French battalion.  There was an Italian battalion.  And then there was also an 
American battalion.  The marines were in Bujumbura, because you may want to know that the Americans had decided to evacuate their nationals through Burundi in order to avoid gathering their nationals in Kigali where fighting was already taking place.  

So the reasoning was that, if those evacuating detachments were put together, that would provide about 1500 men and that, therefore, such a group would not be able to re -- or would have been able to restore order in Kigali.  Unfortunately, that did not happen.  That was not done. 
Q.	In your capacity as an officer of Caritas, how did you react to the departure of these foreign forces? 
A.	Well, clearly, this was not only unsatisfactory for Caritas but also for the Belgians who were in Bujumbura, because we came to the realisation that the country was truly being abandoned and that the doors were actually being opened to the RPF, which would now somewhat have the leeway or authorisation to interfere and proceed with massacres in the absence of a legitimate government.  So the RPF did not recognise the legitimacy of the interim government. 
Q.	Mr. Antheunissens, from what you have just said, how are you -- or how did you know that the RPF did not acknowledge the legality or legitimacy of the interim government, and what were your sources of information? 
A.	I say so simply because, when the interim government was set up, the idea clearly was to continue the peace negotiations to stem disorder and killings in Kigali.  And these were essentially caused by the Presidential Guard and also by some killers.  

So the fact that the RPF continued its own attack was a clear indication that it did not agree to enter into those types of negotiations with the interim government.  You may want to know that the RPF attack was very rapid.  From Ruhengeri it took them less than two days to work with their battalion, which was already within the parliamentary premises in Kigali, to achieve their purposes. 
Q.	A short while ago you stated that Caritas Rwanda as of the 6th or 7th of April was dysfunctional; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  That is correct.  Caritas Rwanda was decapitated immediately, and we learnt at about the same time that the killings had begun to spread in Kigali. 
Q.	When you became aware of those killings through your various sources at the time, were -- was there any identification of the perpetrators or could the information have been confusing? 
A.	No.  There was no clear identification of the perpetrators or -- and there was chaos.  So you would understand that part of the army, mainly the Presidential Guard, was in a state of rebellion but also that, in addition to those, there were other killers who simply killed, looted, and raped.  

And may I say that some of the killings were also perpetrated by the RPF.  That led to a situation of chaos, which, by the way, forced the interim government to retire or withdraw to Gitarama quite quickly. 
Q.	Thank you.  During that period of the first 15 days after the 7th of April -- or let us put it this way:  In the month of April, did you have any contacts whatsoever with any members of the interim government? 
A.	Yes.  On the 30th of April, Caritas Burundi received two ministers of the interim government:  Mr. Bicamumpaka, minister of foreign affairs; and Jean de Dieu Habineza, minister of social affairs.  They had come in the company of a Father on a Saturday morning.  And I was alone at the 
	Caritas office.  They had come to seek urgent assistance for displaced persons who had been driven out by the RPF and who had gathered around Gitarama. 
Q.	Now, can you tell the Court at what time those people came to the Caritas office.  And did -- had you known them previously? 
A.	No.  I did not know those ministers at all.  They simply came with an official vehicle of the Rwandan government at around 10:30 a.m. 
Q.	I would like you to go step by step.  Did you recognise them immediately as Rwandan ministers?  How was the introduction done? 
A.	There was a priest who accompanied them. 
Q.	Did you know the said priest? 
A.	No, not at all.  He was a priest from Butare.  Moreover, he subsequently left for Canada.  For my part my reaction was, first of all, to try to inform the secretary general of Caritas.  But he had left for Bururi to meet his family, and I was not able to reach him.  

My second reaction was that I thought to inform one of the most senior persons at Caritas, who was a member of UPRONA who came to Caritas after the assassination of Ndadaye.  But it -- I thought that that was not very proper, that it was not proper to call someone from UPRONA in the presence of people who came from the interim government.  

So I immediately contacted PAM.  Fortunately, the director of PAM was in his office and he was ready to receive us.  

We had informed the Rwandan ambassador in Bujumbura, and we left together with 
Minister Jean de Dieu Habineza, the ambassador, and myself.  We left for the PAM office.  

I'm going to stop for a moment. 
Q.	Mr. Antheunissens, you said that two ministers showed up at your place, that they were together with a priest.  In other words, there were three people; that's correct?  Therefore, you contacted the Rwandan ambassador in Bujumbura -- 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	-- a representative of PAM.  And if I understand you correctly, you met them in the presence of ministers.  Can you tell us, first of all, who the two ministers were and what happened to the second who was not present during the meeting with PAM and the ambassador.  
A.	Yes.  When we left for the PAM office, the minister of foreign affairs explained to us that it was not within his purview, that he dealt with general politics.  The previous week he had been received in France at a very high level by President Mitterrand and by the French prime minister.  Therefore, matters of housekeeping were not within his purview.  He didn't have time for such matters.

So he left and contacted people he knew in Bujumbura.  Therefore, the meeting at PAM took place together with the min -- Minister Jean de Dieu Habineza, the director of PAM, the 
Rwandan ambassador, and myself.  The PAM director reacted positively by saying that obviously with the stocks available in Burundi he could not intervene.  

You should bear in mind that at that moment stocks were low.  It was difficult to do unloading at the Bujumbura port.  But there -- in Butare, rather, there was a reserve for PAM for Burundian refugees who were there.  Therefore, if it was possible to have access to that reserve, which was about 1000 tons, it could be used to provide aid as we were requested to do.  

Kab -- in Kabgayi -- Kabgayi, in fact, was a special case. 
Q.	Mr. Antheunissens, you are rather fast.  Please, I would like you to give the identity of the minister of foreign affairs as far as you can remember.  
A.	It was Mr. Bicamumpaka. 
Q.	Can you also tell the Court -- or give to the Court the identity, if you remember it -- the identity of the Rwandan ambassador, the representative of PAM who was present at the said meeting.  
A.	I regret in that case I do not quite remember the identity.  Nevertheless, I would like to add that the Rwandan ambassador in Bujumbura was a member of a new Rwandan party, the PL party.  In principle, that party was pro-RPF.  And in that respect, of course, he was very well seen or received in Bujumbura. 
Q.	Mr. Antheunissens, are you the one who informed the Rwandan ambassador of the visit of the two ministers referred to, or is it that when you called him he had already been informed of their presence? 
A.	He had been informed through a radio link -- he had been informed of the visit.  But he did not inform me.  As far as I'm concerned, it was a surprise, but it was not a surprise to him. 
Q.	Before going to the said meeting when you welcomed or received the two ministers and the priest, what did they tell you was the problem, and what did they tell you the situation was? 
A.	Straightaway they talked about a human catastrophe.  They talked about the concentration of tens of thousands of displaced persons in makeshift camps.  They also said that the government was not capable of feeding all the displaced persons.  Furthermore, they told me that they had indeed tried to buy foodstuffs but that they did not have enough resources, first, to buy the foodstuffs; and secondly, to transport the foodstuffs to the place where the displaced persons were. 
Q.	Did they tell you the location of the displaced persons? 
A.	Yes.  They said they were in the vicinity of Gitarama.  Obviously, Kabgayi was a special case.  Kabgayi was not a camp, because the bishop of Kabgayi had opened his bishopric, which was full of displaced persons, Tutsi displaced persons.  There were -- some of them were even outside the bishopric.  

In fact, the bishop was helped in his decision by two other bishops who were also there:  Monsignor Vincent, that is, the archbishop of Kigali; and Monsignor Joseph, who was the bishop of Byumba who had taken refuge in Kabgayi. 
Q.	Did you become aware of the reason why they contacted you?  Did you ask them the question?  And if yes, what was their reply? 
A.	In fact, we -- or, rather, I did not ask that question, but I assumed that if they came to Caritas it was because they feared to be misled to a United Nations organisation, for example.  Caritas seemed to them to be more accessible.  But it's also the fact that they showed up on a Saturday morning.  And this made their visit -- or their request more discreet. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did those ministers inform you of the steps they had taken or the contacts they had made with other states or the United Nations?  And if yes, what did they tell you? 
A.	Yes.  Minister Bicamumpaka told us of ongoing negotiations.  There were negotiations underway with the RPF through General Dallaire, that is, the UNAMIR commander.  There were -- there was also some action by the Rwandan representative at the United Nations, where it was his turn to sit in the Security Council.  

According to Minister Bicamumpaka, he had asked for some -- for some forces to position themselves between the belligerents.  Furthermore, Mr. Bicamumpaka had requested the assistance of countries that were still friends to Rwanda, in other words, Zaire and France.  
Q.	To your knowledge, did he obtain any answer? 
A.	Well, he could not tell us the answer he obtained from the United Nations.  But it would appear that the answer was negative.  As regards the negotiations through the intermediary of General Dallaire, the negotiations seems -- to last forever.  But in any case, the RPF continued its advance.

1515H 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	During that conversation with the ministers which discussion took place -- took -- which discussions took place in the presence of the ambassador and the representative of PAM, Minister Bicamumpaka, or the other minister, did they make any reference to any pressure exerted by the RPF, pressure which made their action impossible?  In short, what was said during that first phase which took place before you met other organisations? 
A.	Minister Bicamumpaka explained that the massacres or killings were misrepresented by the media that the impression was given that the killings targeted only the Tutsis.  However, according to him there were as many Hutu victims as Tutsi victims. 

In the main, he talked about Hutu victims, people who died during the advance of the RPF from the north to Kigali. 
Q.	Did you discuss with them the possibility of stopping the war and the killings? 
A.	No, we did not address that point.  But they complained of the paucity or the lack of resources available to the interim government. 

The army had retreated -- I'm talking about the government forces, the government army.  So the government army had retreated from the border and moved towards Kigali.  In Gitarama, for example, where the interim government was based there was practically no armed forces apart from what they referred to as the civil defence force.  Therefore, they explained that they did not have the necessary resources to cope with their mission. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now we are going to deal with the meeting -- the meeting between PAM and the
	Rwandan ambassador.  What was said, who was present at that meeting? 
A.	During that meeting, apart from Minister Jean de Dieu Habineza, there was the director of PAM, the ambassador and myself.  Therefore, the PAM director took matters positively, but told me that it was obviously necessary to inform everyone in Bujumbura; in other words, inform all humanitarian organisations, NGOs and so on.  This was a problem because it was a Saturday and it was not necessarily -- to schedule such a meeting before Tuesday.  At that moment the two ministers would have left, but the Rwandan ambassador was to participate in the meeting and he was to propose to the NGOs and humanitarian organisations that so wished some reconnaissance or meeting in Gitarama.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
We're sorry, Mr. President.  What we have been referring to as PAM is actually WFP, the 
World Food Programme. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Antheunissens, I'm still dealing with the day of the 30th. 

MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President is looking at me, perhaps there is an overlap, or there is a -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No.  In the English translation there is an explanation given which shall assist us in understanding what the witness has been saying. 

They had been simply pronouncing an acronym and they've explained what it means. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	So, Mr. Antheunissens, we are still dealing with the day of the 30th of April.  At some point in time did you ever call Mr. Ghiste?  
A.	Yes, I called him.  I called Jean Ghiste over the phone.  We knew one another very well since we were together in several meetings in Bujumbura.  And there was continuous coordination at WFP, the 
Human Rights Commission, UNICEF, and so on.  Therefore, I knew Jean Ghiste very well.  It is also true that I called him over the phone.  I called -- it was a friendly call to talk about the problem that was of concern to us. 
Q.	What exactly did you tell him and what was his answer? 
A.	Well, I told him that Caritas, in an extraordinary manner, had been visited by ministers of the interim government.  He did not react immediately, but he suggested that we have dinner at his residence.  

I should also add that on that very day, that is, the 30th of April, the director of international aid, Caritas international aid, that is, Hubert Demaere, had arrived -- or arrived on that day. 
	
So, obviously, together we talked of the case that was before us.  And I believe he accompanied us to the dinner. 
Q.	I'm going to spell Hubert Demaere, unless you want to do it.  
A.	I will spell Hubert Demaere.  The complete name is Hubert Demaere Daertrycke.   I will start the spelling:  Hotel, Uniform, Bravo, Echo, Romeo, Tango; Delta, Echo, Mike, Alpha, Echo, Romeo -- 
Q.	You're going too fast, Mr. Antheunissens.  This is not a military operation.  This is a court with interpreters, courtroom reporters and so on. 
A.	I apologise to the interpreters and the courtroom reporters.  I take that again, the spelling:  Hotel, Uniform, Bravo, Echo, Romeo, Tango; Delta, Echo, Mike, Alpha, Echo, Romeo, Echo; Delta, Alpha, Echo, Romeo, Tango, Romeo, Yankee, Charlie, Kilo, Echo.  That's it.  Hubert Demaere Daertrycke.  
Q.	Can you write it on a piece of paper, I would be able later on to give that piece of paper to the courtroom reporters. 
Are you done?  
A.	Yes. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. Issa, please kindly help us to collect the piece of paper with the spelling.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	And in the meantime we will be continuing with the 30th of April.  

So on that day you called Jean Ghiste to share with him what was -- you said or what you discussed.  You proposed to him -- or you had to go therefore to his house for dinner and you had to go there with the director of Caritas international aid. 
A.	Apart from Hubert and myself, there was also Minister Jean de Dieu Habineza.  Of course, Mrs. Ghiste.  I have no recollection of any other participant at the dinner. 

I would like to add that during the said dinner perhaps we talked briefly about the ongoing events, but there was no initiative, there was no decision that was taken. 

The next step was meeting -- the meeting of Tuesday morning, a meeting of all organisations -- all Caritas organisations in Bujumbura. 
Q.	And the meeting of Tuesday -- the meeting of the following Tuesday -- the people who were present at the dinner, with the exception of Mrs. Ghiste, were they all present?  Can you tell us who was present and in what context? 
A.	Well, there were many participants Caritas during the day of Monday had to send, through a messenger, invitations.  And the number of participants was such that the premises of Caritas turned out to be too small and we had to hold the meeting at the seminary. 

The ministers were not there, Bicamumpaka and Jean de Dieu Habineza were not there, but the Rwandan ambassador was there.  Hubert Demaere was also there, so I -- so was I. There was, therefore, a huge number of people representing humanitarian organisations and NGOs.  

I would like to add that many of them came there out of curiosity.  In fact, they had no intention of committing themselves to any project in Rwanda. 
Q.	What was said?  How were matters presented? 
A.	In fact, we took the -- we accepted the invitation of the interim government to carry out some reconnaissance mission in Gitarama for the purpose of organising the provision of assistance.  But as a matter of course, we insisted that the reconnaissance mission take place quickly.  However, there was some additional point to be addressed.  The -- the World Food Programme, a day before, had sent vehicles to Butare.  It had sent vehicles and they noticed that the stock of 1000 tons was untouched.  The World Food Programme immediately organised the supply of aid to Gitarama, aid to the two camps in Kabgayi.  They also delivered 15 tons to Father Viejo Kurik.  I'll spell that:  Victor, India, Echo, Juliet, Oscar; Kilo, Uniform, Romeo, India, Kilo. 

Please allow me to open a parenthesis here to talk about Viejo Kurik.  Who is Viejo Kurik?  

Around the 7th or 8th of September Viejo Kurik was a Franciscan brother, a priest of a small parish near Kabgayi. 

He came on his own together -- or in a -- a lorry -- he came to Caritas Burundi and said:  "Load the lorry, I am leaving right away."  Nevertheless, he had explained that in his parish there were -- many people had been killed, many Tutsis had been killed.  He even added that two days after -- that was on a Sunday -- that the parishioners were in a -- in a Mass, as usual, and now they said:  "You have killed our brothers and you are now stealing their oil."  He explained that everyone was crying.  

Viejo Kurik was a young man, a very solid young man, as you usually find in this area of Croatia.  He was also extremely active.  In fact, he took charge of everything.  Therefore, the 
World Food Programme, informed of the presence of Viejo Kurik, had given him 15 tons of food.  That was not much, but it was enough for the initial aid. 
Q.	Yes, Mr. Antheunissens.  I am rather confused by the date you gave.  Did you say the 
	28th of September?
A.	I'm not absolutely sure, but it was a few days before the arrival of ministers of the interim government. 
Q.	Are we now in the month of September or April?
A.	I'm sorry.  Obviously it was in the month of April. 
Q.	So you mean the 28th of April 1994.  This was a parenthesis. 
A.	This was a parenthesis.  I will, therefore, come back to the meeting, that is, I will come back to Caritas.  So we reiterated the proposal to carry out the reconnaissance mission as soon as possible, but the reaction of the participants was:  Well, since WFP has been able to make -- or -- make a first delivery, we are no longer so much in a hurry.  We should therefore contact our sponsors and so on.  And the first date that we were able to set for the reconnaissance mission in Gitarama and Kabgayi was the 11th of May.  

So the ambassador, the Rwandan ambassador accepted that date and explained that he was going to inform the interim government of the date.  We had a discussion on security, the security situation.  He explained that there was no problem.  He added that civil defence programme was -- would provide security of the itinerary and that they would not object to the passing of humanitarian vehicles, but that out of caution it was necessary to avoid including Belgians and Tutsis in the convoy.  In fact, that was the end of the meeting. 
Q.	And how were you informed of the fact that the proposal to carry out the visit on the 11th of May -- how were you informed that that proposal had been accepted by the interim government? 
A.	Well, we had given a deadline for an answer and three -- two or three days after that we received a positive answer from WFP.  There was also World Vision.  Should -- maybe I should spell World Vision:  Whiskey, Oscar, Romeo, Lima, Delta; Victor, India, Sierra, India, Oscar, November.  

This was an American NGO.  There was also the CRS, which we already have mentioned, and there was also the head of CRS in Rwanda who had been evacuated but who had returned to take up quarters in Bujumbura.  That's it. 

I'm sorry.  A second meeting was organised and the ambassador was present at that meeting.  The purpose of the meeting was to look into the technical details of each visit, the time, and so on. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Antheunissens.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I suppose it is 3:30 p.m.  I cannot clearly see the clock, but if it is 3:30 p.m. then I believe it is time for our break and then we'll continue tomorrow morning with Mr. Antheunissens. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
How much time do you anticipate you would need to complete him tomorrow, in-chief?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I would need about one hour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It is time to take the adjournment now, and we resume tomorrow morning at 9 -- at 8:45.  At the usual time, 8:45. 

So we will take our adjournment now. 
(Court adjourned at 1531H)
