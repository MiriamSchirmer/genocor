MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Tuesday, the 12th of May 2009, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Appearances.  

I suppose I should, first of all, enquire whether the video conference at the other end can see and hear us.  Is anybody hearing us?  I can now see someone.
MS. MUZIGO-MORRISON:
Good morning, Your Honour.  The witness is here.  And in the room I have two representatives from the Defence team, the witness and myself representing the registry.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)...I can see someone, but I cannot hear anything.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Your Honour, the representative of the registry just responded to your questions telling us -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I apologise.  My hearing device was not switched on.  Thank you very much.  

Could we have appearances, please.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Good morning to the Court, to the parties, to the registry.  The Prosecution is represented by myself, Don Webster, along with Saidou N'dow, Arif Virani, Takeh Sendze, Sunkarie Ballah-Conteh.  The record should also reflect the presence of our investigator, Upendra Bagel, and one of our legal assistants, Chelsea Fewkes.  Good morning to everyone.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Good morning, Your Honour.  Dior Diagne, my -- and my client, Édouard Karemera, on the other side.  In The Hague, our legal assistant, Mrs. Fatou Ndour.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Good morning, Your Honours, Chantal Hounkpatin, lead counsel for Mathieu Ngirumpatse, who is still absent, in the presence of my investigator.  On the other side, my assistant, Mariana Yetongon.  And my co-counsel, Frédéric Weyl, is absent.  
MR. NIMY: 
Your Honours, good morning.  José Patrick Nimy Mayidika Ngimbi, co-counsel for Joseph Nzirorera, who is present here with me.  I also have Léopold Nsengiyumva, who is a legal assistant, and our intern, Eddy Batrouney.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Now, we are now about to proceed with the testimony from the end of our video conference.  And I would request that the registrar at the location would administer the oath to the witness.  
MS. MUZIGO-MORRISON:
Most obliged, Your Honour. 
(Declaration made by Agnès Mukarugomwa in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Madam Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Now you have taken the oath.  You will give your evidence by responding to questions put to you by counsel designated for that purpose.  And I think you will respond, first of all, to counsel representing Mr. Joseph Nzirorera, who will now begin to examine you.  
MR. NIMY: 
I believe there's a problem with interpretation, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much for putting it that way, Mr. Nimy, but I think I made an error.  

Madam Witness, you will have to, first of all, respond to counsel for Mr. Édouard Karemera, who will now begin her examination of you.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Your Honour, I would, first of all, like to state that the witness is testifying with her identity in accordance with the order which you rendered to that respect and as you further stated during this session or the last session.  And I would like the witness to confer -- to concur herself.  
THE WITNESS:
My name is Agnès Mukarugomwa.  I was born on 2 September 1955.  I was born in the 
Kibayi commune, Butare préfecture, in the Kimana cellule, Shyombo secteur.  My father is Munyurwa, Théoneste.  And my mother is Scholastique Nyirabatutsi.  I wonder if you want any further detail.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
I believe that will be okay, Madam Witness.  You have -- you have provided your particulars, hence, confirming your personal decision to testify in open session.  
THE WITNESS:
That's correct.  
AGNÈS MUKARUGOMWA, 
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:  
Q.	Agnès, could you tell the Chamber if you lost family members during the events in Rwanda in April 1994.  
A.	During that period in Rwanda, my mother, Scholastique Nyirabatutsi, lost her life, and subsequently, my father died.  My older sister also died afterwards.  But considering the fact that I was not there, I don't know under what circumstances those people died.  However, my understanding is that they died during the events which brought grief to Rwanda.  
Q.	Thank you, sincerely.  And I understand that situation.  

Could you tell the Chamber what your situation was in 1994. 
A.	At the time, I was working for Caritas Rwanda.  I was in charge of providing assistance to people who were in difficulty.  More specifically, we were in charge of people who were displaced because of war.  
Q.	And how long did you work there? 
A.	I worked for long in Caritas, about two years.  I left Caritas when everybody was fleeing the country into exile.  So as from the 7th, I ceased working for Caritas, that is, the 7th of April.  
Q.	Do you remember the day you left -- the date at which you left Rwanda?  
A.	I left my country, Rwanda, that is, on the 14th of July.  That is when I went into exile with other people.  I was fleeing from war, and I went to Zaire.  
Q.	Did you, indeed, state that you left Caritas on the 7th of April 1994?  
A.	I wouldn't say I left Caritas.  Rather, I would say that I was compelled to flee -- to flee into exile, because when we arrived, the refugee camps had continued to assist humanitarian organisations, including Caritas.  And I worked for Caritas International, and my work consisted in locating refugees and ensuring their well-being.  So I can't say I left my job.  I continued to live and feel the pain of the others, although I also felt lots of pain in surviving.  
Q.	As a matter of fact, Agnès, a while ago I put to you the question, namely, "Until which day did you work in Rwanda with Caritas?"  And what I heard that you said, that up till 7th April 1994.  What I would want to know, if that was not a mistake.  
A.	I worked for the Caritas, so on the 7th I didn't leave.  Rather, I was there on the 6th.  Later, on the 7th, we were forced to stay indoors because security -- there wasn't enough security.  
Q.	Thank you.  Agnès, did you know Mr. Édouard Karemera? 
A.	I knew Édouard Karemera very well.  More specifically, I got to know him when he was in charge of the national health committee, and we used to nickname him Rukusanya.  But children and other people knew him at that time when -- when we nicknamed him Rukusanya, R-U-K-I-S-A-N-A-Y-A (sic), Rukusanya. 
Q.	Have you worked in the ministry of the interior yourself? 
A.	Yes, I worked for the ministry of the interior.  I was in charge of running a power programme on the manage -- on the running -- on the management of the country.  So I was involved with the communication service.  
Q.	(No interpretation) 
A.	Yes, I was a presenter of Administration du territoire or administration of the country. 
Q.	Thank you.  Were you a member of a political party at the time in Rwanda?  
A.	Yes, I was a member of the MRND.  
Q.	And did you attend political rallies or debates and conferences of a political nature? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  MRND rallies were meant to sensitise people to love their work, to carry on working, to ensure unity.  And MRND rallies allowed people to meet each other to exchange ideas on various daily life activities within the population.  
Q.	And as a presenter on this radio programme known as "vie administrative au Rwanda" or administrative life in Rwanda, you made reports on these conferences and rallies held by the MRND? 
A.	Yes.  Yes.  We presented such programmes to sensitise the population with regard to multipartyism, its importance and how everyone had to behave during multipartyism.  
Q.	And if you had a chance of listening to Mr. Karemera during those rallies, could you tell the Chamber if you remember any time, at least once, when he made a speech that was discriminatory in nature? 
A.	He never made such speeches.  As a matter of fact, MRND didn't say such things.  With regard to Édouard Karemera, I never heard him say any speech that was discriminatory in nature.  Never, never.  
Q.	Agnès, were you aware of Mr. Karemera's appointment as minister of the interior of Rwanda? 
A.	When he was appointed minister of the interior, Radio Rwanda informed us about it, and I listened to that programme over Radio Rwanda.  
Q.	Do you recall the period during which he was appointed? 
A.	I believe I remember that date by -- off heart.  He took the oath of office on the 25 of May 2000 -- 1994. 
Q.	And do you remember at what place you were during that period?  
A.	I was in Gitarama.  
Q.	Do you remember having seen Mr. Karemera at that period in Gitarama as well?  
A.	It wasn't easy to see people because everybody was fleeing.  Everyone was trying to get away.  But, of course, Karemera arrived in Gitarama because there were many refugees in Gitarama.  As a matter of fact, all along the way used by refugees, Nyundo, Kabaya towards Gisenyi, the refugees faced lots of problems.  They fell ill during this displacement, and I believe that Karemera no doubt went there to see those refugees.  And these people did not have the status of refugees.  They were considered as displaced person on Rwandan territory.  Among these refugees you had displaced people because of the war who had left their homes since 1 October 1990.  Those people were tired, had left their homes for four years.  So my understanding is that Karemera must have gone there to visit them when he was able to.  
Q.	And you, Agnès, during that time, how did you manage the situation of displaced persons, as my understanding is that you were still working for Caritas and that the situation of these displaced persons was of primary concern to you? 
A.	That's correct.  I was working for Caritas, although we didn't have enough means to carry out our work fully.  Everywhere where refugees were found, I still was concerned about them.  As a matter of fact, I had indeed become a refugee myself, and I was still with the refugees everywhere.  We tried to put our efforts together so that the stronger people should assist the weaker ones so that the people who had things to eat would share it with those who didn't have any.  We were united and we had hope that the truth would reemerge and that we would all recover -- everyone would recover their property. 
Q.	Agnès, did you know at the time what the ministry of the interior had been able to do in spite of its scarce resources in order to assist the displaced persons? 
A.	The ministry of the interior, in cooperation with other ministries, was trying to provide assistance to all the persons who were in the refugee camps from the 1st of October 1990 onwards.  When we learned that members of the public had been displaced because of the war, the ministry of the interior did its best in order to secure assistance for those members of the population.  
Q.	Do you remember the date of the capture by the RPF of Kabgayi? 
A.	The RPF captured Kabgayi in June.  I believe it was on the 4th of June or, in any case, around that date.  But when referring to the fall of Kabgayi, we should not forget that wherever the RPF went, members of the public were killed.  They were either shot or they died from diseases or died of other causes.  
Q.	And on that date in June you just referred to, were you able to observe that the situation of the displaced persons from Byumba, from the Nyacyonga camp up to the Kibumba camp, including Runda, Ngororero, Kabaya, up to Gisenyi, do you believe that the situation of the populations that had been displaced in these areas had worsened? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  There was chaos.  You should remember that the members of the public had left Byumba since 1990 and had come on foot and had reached the Nyacyonga camp.  It was a large refugee camp.  There were at least 50 people arriving at that camp on a daily basis, so you can imagine that the members -- the inhabitants who went through Runda, reached Kabaya, Gisenyi, to finally cross towards Zaire were not only in a disastrous situation, but there was no way to qualify the situation.  People were dying on the way.  Words fail me to explain the situation at the time.  It was truly a disaster that had affected our country and all its inhabitants. 
Q.	Madam Witness, if you were to assess the actions of the ministry of the interior, which was headed by its minister, of course, from the end of May 1994, would you say that the ministry did its level best in order to try to assist the displaced populations? 
A.	They did everything they could to assist the inhabitants who had sought refuge everywhere in the communes where the refugees were arriving.  They would settle in those communes when there was still some assistance available, and they would share this assistance amongst themselves up until the time we crossed the border to Zaire.  Once we reached Zaire, some went ahead in order to try and find housing for those inhabitants.  

The ministry of the interior also did something else, and more specifically, Minister Karemera.  He asked that the roadblocks -- that the passage of the refugees be facilitated at the roadblocks and asked that the roadblocks that were not necessary be disassembled so that the refugees would be able to pass through, since they were trying to save their lives. 
Q.	Agnès, in view of the difficult situation of the displaced persons -- or, rather, on the basis of the difficult situation of the displaced persons, you have produced a work of art.  Am I correct?  
A.	Yes, indeed, I produced a work of art on this subject.  It is a documentary entitled "Inzira ndende".  In fact, this documentary is on the long trip of the Rwandans when they took to the roads after the attack by the RPF.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
I wish to seek the assistance of Mr. Issa for him to show the parties photographs which are taken from Mrs. Agnès's work of art and which show the situation she just described to the Trial Chamber with regard to the displaced persons during that period.  Is Mr. -- 

Mr. President, in fact, the pictures were taken from an original DVD I had planned on having shown here to the Trial Chamber for three minutes.  And, as usual, at the very last minute, we had technical problems.  The technician was making an attempt, along with my investigator, Bernard Munyanziza.  But it seems, Mr. President, that the system is not working, when my intention was to have three minutes of the tape shown to you so that you would have some idea of the activities of Mrs. Agnès under the supervision of the ministry of the interior at the time, and this, to the benefit of the displaced populations that we can see on the photographs.  And she is also visible on a photograph, 
	Mr. President, showing how people were preparing to go into exile.  And Mr. President -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry to interrupt, but earlier I was trying to make an objection and I didn't catch the Court's attention so I sat back down.  But I would appreciate it if Maître Diagne resisted leading the witness, because many of the questions she was asking recently were leading, and now she's actually testifying on behalf of the witness.  So I can appreciate that she wants the Court to see these images, but she should have the witness testify as opposed to testifying herself.  

And then in terms of discussing these photographs, there's been nothing on the record to indicate from the witness that this is footage or images from 1994, and we've had a refugee crisis in the Great Lakes now for the last 15 years.  So if she could ask the witness if these photographs or the footage was from 1994 during the genocide or afterwards and if she could elicit information from the witness as opposed to giving evidence herself.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Well, Mr. President, as a matter of fact, the difficulty is that the witness is not currently seeing the pictures, but she is the author of the work and she knows her work perfectly.  And also, in order to satisfy counsel for the Prosecution, I can give her the floor for her to comment her work in person and so that she gives more information on the specific periods that have inspired her to produce this work.  And perhaps in this way no one will be under the impression that I am testifying on behalf of the witness but, rather, that it is the witness herself who is making comments on her work.  
THE WITNESS:
If I am to be given the floor, I wish to say that I would like, if possible, that the documentary be shown so that we will be able to see how I was among the refugees, trying to assist them.  I was in Muvumba -- I was in Mukarange, in Muvumba along with the war-displaced persons up until the time when we left our country for good.  So it was a long road, and there are a number of pictures that were taken.  And if you take a look at the photographs, you will observe in what dire situation the people were following the RPF attack since the 1st of October 1990. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, with your leave, the technicians are telling us that if we were to give them five minutes, they would be able to show the three-minute footage.  And in that way the witness will be in a position to comment her own work.  So, Mr. President, with your leave, could we be granted a few minutes -- or, rather, grant the technicians a few minutes for them to be able to play the footage to you?  And I wish to specify that this will not be more than three minutes.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, I welcome an opportunity to see the video footage.  I'm not opposed to that.  But I would request that Maître Diagne lay a bit more foundation before we spend our time and resources viewing it.  Can the witness tell us -- she must have seen it or she knows what three minutes we're going to see -- when were those images taken?  Was it in 1990?  Was it before 1994 or was it after 1994?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, when I tried to explain this to the witness (sic), he said I was testifying on behalf of the witness, and now I am being requested to resume the exercise he tried to interrupt earlier on.  

Mr. President, I was explaining that counsel for the Prosecution is now asking for me to explain the context, and I was saying that that was what I was doing earlier on.  I wished to explain the context or the circumstances under which this work was produced, and it deals, indeed -- it, indeed, deals with the situation of the displaced persons in 1994 from May, June up to the month of July, as was stated by the witness earlier on, when the populations crossed the border to Zaire.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maître Diagne, I think that what would be of interest to the Chamber would be if you elicited from the witness what the DVD represents.  Who made the photographs?  When were they done, the photographs?  So if the witness could explain this to us, I think it would satisfy the issue which has just been raised.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
I am much obliged, Mr. President.  Do we have your leave to have the three-minute footage shown and then the witness will be able to answer the questions herself?  I see that the technician is already here.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Couldn't you ask the witness whose work it is and when the work was done?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Yes, Mr. President.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Agnès, can you tell the Trial Chamber who is the author of this work, Inzange (sic), "The Long Journey".  
A.	The title of the work is "The Long Journey," Inzira ndende.  I am the author of this work, but I was assisted by other people for it to be made into a video.  But the comments are mine, since I have known this long journey firsthand.  I was living with those inhabitants who were moving from one place to the other.  So the commentary is mine.  I have asked someone to take the pictures for me since I was well aware of the suffering of the inhabitants.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, can we now show the three-minute footage?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, when I interrupted before, I had stated on three occasions that my interest was to know when this was done.  When -- the footage reflects what period of time?  And Ms. Diagne has not elicited the most important information that I was seeking.  So she will come to it at some point, I'm sure, but earlier would be better than later. 
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Madam Agnès, could you tell the Trial Chamber when you were able to produce this work of art?  
A.	Well, in fact, a work of art cannot be designed in a single day.  I started this work when I was still amidst the inhabitants in Rwanda.  When I was still in Rwanda, I would see what the situation was, I would write, take notes and try to find ways and means of making the difficult situation of the inhabitants known to the public.  In fact, I was -- it was a work in progress, but I had not yet been able to get any pictures.  But ten years later, other people helped me to produce a video.  But I wish to say that I only provided a few pictures to show what the situation was.  But we did not take pictures of all the situations lived through by the members of the population.  When you're producing a work, you have several photographs at your disposal, but we selected a few of them for our work.  

Otherwise, the inhabitants greatly suffered and experienced many difficult situations which do not appear on the photographs we chose.  Let me say briefly that the inhabitants suffered greatly, and this since 1990 up until the time when they fled to Zaire.  

The purpose of this work was to use these photographs, this video, in order to assist the international judicial system or justice system, especially you in Arusha, for you to be aware of the causes of the Rwandan disaster and so that you will be able to see whether the authorities could have done something when faced with this attack by the RPF and in order for you to better understand the circumstances under which the members of the population lived because of the RPF attack.  

So the -- my objective was to have the world know about what had happened so that justice would be done and so that those who were -- did not have the fortune to bury their kin also be able to bury them, since the truth would come to the fore.  
Q.	Agnès, thank you for having explained to the Trial Chamber the circumstances under which this work started being produced and also the period.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
I believe counsel for the Prosecution has some knowledge on this issue and can, indeed, confirm that it is, indeed, how a work of art is produced.  

That being said, Mr. President, could we now, with your leave, have the footage shown?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will allow the footage to be shown now.  Is it a video or is it a collection of still photographs?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Both.  And for the video, the technicians had requested some time before we show the pictures in order to set up the system enabling us to see the footage.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We've been advised that we need to rise in order for this to take place.  So we will rise for a few minutes and resume when we have been advised that the system is in place.  
(Court recessed from 1057H to 1110H) 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, I'm interested to hear the witness's testimony and see what this video reveals, but I must comment for the record that this -- I have not seen it yet.  We're about to see it for the first time.  And this is the type of thing that should have been disclosed to us long ago.  It seems that this video was made some years ago.  I believe the common understanding that we share in this Chamber is that when one is putting on a case, the exhibits that one plans to use is normally circulated in advance of the witness's testimony.  But I voice my -- not my objection to the evidence, but my disappointment that I'm seeing this for the first time now.  And I would ask Ms. Diagne, if she has anything else that she plans to use with the witness, it would make things much easier if we could receive that now before she uses it during her examination.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Thank you.  Firstly, let me say I don't have any further documents I intend to use.  This document, 
	Your Honour, is an illustration of the witness's testimony, that is, the goal of her testimony.  Once more, I am sorry.  I am -- I regret that the Prosecutor talks about providing this to him because, as I know, as usual, he may provide us a pile of documents when he is cross-examining this document.  So I would just like to tell the Chamber that it is merely an illustrative -- that everything that the witness has done, she made a work of art which I wanted to share with the Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's move on now, please.  Can you show the video?  
(Video played)
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Thank you, Your Honour, for having given leave for this video -- for this footage to be shown.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Agnès.  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	I would like to congratulate you for the beauty of this work and especially for the truth that it shows.  

Could you, in a few words, comment, although the footage is quite eloquent by itself.  
A.	I would like to state the following:  As I said -- told you a while ago, you just saw footage which is an illustration of a drop of water in what -- of what Rwanda went through from 1 October 1990 up to when I created this work.  This work shows the suffering of people, but we still have to know who was at the source of this suffering.  The people who were arrested here and there and taken to Arusha, did you find the people who triggered this catastrophe among them?  There are people who are still on the run and who are perpetrators of this catastrophe.  You saw the footage of some people.  If some of them are still alive, they have to know who triggered this catastrophe, who set fire to a country where there was milk and honey, and which subsequently based in suffering, murder and tears.  

	This country which some -- in which some people, members of the country -- of the population lost their relatives have to be able to mourn them.  And you also have people who lost dear ones and who cannot mourn them.  These people have to know the truth.  God gave you legal minds, the ability to seek the truth, and you have to do that so all Rwandans, irrespective of where they are, should be able to know the truth.  Hence, once the truth is known to these people, they will be able to mourn their loved ones.  

This footage showed you under what circumstances these people lived.  Every authority in their -- as far as they were concerned used their -- the means they had to assist them.  But this was not easy.  People had to move because of gunfire from the RPF so were unable to carry out the work as we intended.  So we did our best to provide as many images as we could have gotten from Zaire, where we were, because while we were there, we did not know we would survive for two days, because the people who were in the country, nobody was sure among them if they were going to survive because RPF attacks affected us all the time.  This work was put together for the Judges to be able to know what the truth is and enable all Rwandans to live in Rwanda and feel at home in Rwanda. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Agnès.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Your Honour, it is on that note that I would like to tell you that my examination-in-chief is over.  
	Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Diagne.  

Do any other Defence counsel wish to examine this witness?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Your Honour, I don't have any questions for the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. NIMY: 
I don't have any either, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Nimy.  

Mr. Prosecutor?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Will the Court be disappointed if I ask a few questions?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We didn't expect any less, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'll begin by saying that this is a much shorter and much briefer examination-in-chief than I anticipated because, according to the witness summary, the witness was going to discuss interviews that 
Édouard Karemera gave at a meeting held in Gitarama on the 28th of May 1994, so that's actually what I prepared for.  But I will push ahead and see what we can make of the witness's testimony.  

I do have documents that were circulated to the parties by email, which I assume everyone has now.  And documents that I've printed out I will have given to the interpreters, but I will not distribute my printed documents until there is a need for them so that I will not inundate everyone with printed materials.  But as I use them, I will distribute the printed materials to the Court and to the other parties.

It seems Ms. Diagne wants to say something.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Excuse me.  I did not receive anything from the Prosecutor.  I understand that he talked about a disclosure of a document he plans to use, but I did not receive that.  
MR. NIMY: 
Your Honour, I would like to state that I did not receive anything from the Prosecutor either.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I would imagine that these documents are being circulated by email by the registry.  All of them were sent to the registry yesterday with instructions that they be distributed once the witness completes her direct examination.  We may not even use them.  I was simply making introductory remarks so that everyone can understand where I'm going with my examination.  

So if I may proceed. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Madam Witness, good morning to you.  
A.	Good morning.  Good morning.  
Q.	Thank you.  Bonjour.  

Could you begin by telling us when you started working with the ministry of the interior, because I'm a bit confused between your job at Caritas and your job with the ministry of the interior.  
A.	I worked in the ministry of the interior as an officer in charge of information as from 1982 to 1992.  
Q.	And after 1992, did you have any responsibilities in the ministry of the interior? 
A.	I didn't have responsibilities, so to speak, but I was -- I was on secondment to Caritas from the ministry of the interior, which had a social services section.  So I worked for Caritas as an -- as a state liaison, meaning that when I was in Caritas, I was able to see everything that was happening in my home, especially I had just left the ministry of the interior -- at the beginning of the war I worked in the ministry of the interior.  On 1 October 1990 I was working for the ministry of the interior.  
Q.	Madam Witness -- 
A.	I followed the fleeing of the people.  And then, subsequently, I worked for Caritas.  When I carried on my work I didn't leave the people -- the members of the population. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Madam Witness.  Do you recall when it was in 1992 that you stopped working for the ministry of the interior?  Can you give us a month or a time of the year?  
A.	In 19 -- which year?  What was the question?  
Q.	Well, you have already told us that you stopped working for the ministry of the interior in 1992 and that you went on to work for Caritas at that time.  And I'm trying to find out from you when in 1992.  Was it at the beginning of 1992, the middle of 1992 or the end of 1992?  If you can recall the month, tell us.  If you don't recall the month, tell us what time, what period within 1992 you stopped working for the ministry of interior.  
A.	Can I rectify?  In the ministry of the interior, after multipartyism the social services section went to another section.  I was working for the ministry of the interior until 1992.  I cannot recall the exact date.  And then that is when I went to the ministry of social affairs, my main activity being information.  That is when I become -- became the liaison with Caritas to monitor the situation of displaced persons, because up till then they were not yet refugees; they were displaced persons and other persons who needed assistance.  
Q.	I still haven't gotten the information I was looking for, but maybe you don't recall, because what I'm trying to find out is when in 1992 you left the ministry of the interior.  If you don't know or if you don't remember, it's not a problem, we'll move on.  But my primary concern is to find out when you stopped being responsible for the radio programme "vie administrative au Rwanda" because you told us you did that when you were with the ministry of the interior.  
A.	Yes, that date, Prosecutor, indeed, is the date which I no longer recall.  But as I have always worked with the people -- population, and as I've always presented missions, even when I was in the ministry of social affairs and even while I was in Caritas, there were programmes which I presented to the ministry of social affairs.  I am sorry, but I do not have the date.  I don't recall the specific days when I stopped presenting radio programmes in the ministry of the interior.  
Q.	So, Madam Witness, it would be fair to say that after 1992, you no longer monitored the meetings and rallies and messages from the MRND party about the administrative affairs in the country; isn't that correct?  
A.	No, not the rallies, because it was the life of the country, and we were also participating in the social and political life of the country.  And besides, those were times when we were to follow what was happening.  Those were times during which the RPF was at war in our country in Rwanda.  So rallies were meant to -- or, meetings were meant to follow what was happening but also to participate with other members of the public and see how we could remain united and assist those who had been displaced, had left their homes, and see how we could remain united, as was advocated by the MRND party.  So I remained active in view of the social political situation of my country.  
Q.	Yes, Madam Witness, I can appreciate that.  But the value of your evidence in regard to that radio programme was that you had an official duty to monitor what the MRND was saying about administrative affairs, and because you had a duty to do so and did so regularly, you are in a position to comment that Karemera said nothing anti-Tutsi during that period.  But what we now learn is that you no longer had those responsibilities after 1992; isn't that so?  
A.	I no longer had such responsibilities, but it did not prevent me from monitoring what was happening in the country.  I attended all the rallies, and the people who remained in MININTER were my colleagues when I worked there.  So I cannot say that I did not follow their rallies.  I went to the rallies.  I heard what Karemera was saying over the airwaves of Radio Rwanda, and I told you that I did not hear Karemera make any derogatory speech about the Tutsis.  I listened to the programmes on the radio, I attended rallies, and I was in contact with the members of the public.  Counsel for the Prosecution, I wish to confirm that I never heard Karemera make any negative speech vis-à-vis the Tutsi. 
Q.	Well, prior to 1994, when he became the minister of the interior, what basis would he have to speak to the nation over the radio about administrative affairs?  
A.	I told you about the time when he was minister of the interior, but you should recall that at the time there were -- there was multiparty politics in the country, and he could no longer address everyone in the country because political parties had already been established and each party had its representatives.  And we should also remember that during multiparty politics, the administrative authorities could not be chairing a political party, and a chairman of the political party could not hold an administrative position.  And that was why -- and so Karemera became a minister during that period of multiparty politics, and I cannot say that he had the same powers as the other authorities in Rwanda before the advent of multiparty politics.  
Q.	Well, Madam Witness, wouldn't you agree that Édouard Karemera had no role in the government after 1991 and no senior role in the MRND party until 1993?  
A.	I wish to insist on one issue, the circumstances under which he exercised his powers as a minister.  The political situation was one of the multiparty politics.  In other words, he did not have as much power over the administrative departments or echelons in the ministry at the time, because this was the period of multiparty politics.  Of course, he carried out his duties.  He said what he was -- he had to say.  He advocated unity.  He asked people to work within the MRND.  And that was what he was meant to do, because he was in charge of his ministry.  But no one can say that he was not useful.  He was quite useful in light of the prevailing situation.  
Q.	Madam Witness -- 
A.	There were bourgmestres -- 
Q.	Madam Witness, you know, I apologise that we can't see each other directly, because if you were in the courtroom, I would signal to you to pause a bit.  I'm finding that your answers are very long and they're not immediately responsive to my question.  So I'm not trying to stop you from giving evidence, but I would like your answers to address my question in particular.  

Now, I am not suggesting that Édouard Karemera was not useful.  What I am suggesting to you is that I believe it is after 1991 he had no official role in the government, he was at one point ministre à la présidence, but I believe that ended in 1990 or 1991 and that he had no seat on the executive committee of the MRND party until July of 1993 when he was elected to be the first vice-president.  

And if that is so, there would have been very little for you to monitor when you were working at the ministry of the interior up until 1992, and there would have been very little for you to notice, at least coming over the radio, until sometime towards the end of 1993.  So would you comment on that, in particular, please.  
A.	I wish to apologise because of my long-winded answers.  But there is a simultaneous interpretation system, and I'm not used to that system, and perhaps this is the reason why I'm giving long answers.  But I will be careful for my future answers.  

Now, let me answer the question put to me whereby I was taking interest in what Karemera was doing.  I told you that we got to know him more specifically when he was chairing the synthesis committee which led to the establishment of multiparty politics.  So we monitored what he was saying during that period to the inhabitants. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Madam Witness.  Now, with regard to the film that you made, were you present when any of the footage that we -- that we saw was actually shot?  In other words, I'm asking you if you were there seeing what the camera saw for the footage that we saw just a few minutes ago.  
A.	Yes, I was there.  I told you that I was a refugee among the other members of the Rwandan population who were fleeing the country.  I was always with the members of the population during exile, what elements should be used and should be included in the video, so that was the work of production of the video itself.  I was present when those pictures were shot, and if I was given the opportunity, I would be able to indicate the different places.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the Kinyarwanda booth has problems following the witness, because the witness switches from Kinyarwanda to French and vice versa.  The witness should select which language she intends to testify in because the interpreters are experiencing problems. 

MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Yes, Mr. President, this was indeed the reason for my standing up.  I wish to tell Mrs. Agnès that we are encountering difficulties because she is switching from one language to the other.  And I believe I understand how difficult that can be for the interpreters to follow them, because we are faced with the same difficulties right now.  

And I have some concern because the Trial Chamber does not speak French, nor does it speak Kinyarwanda, and as a result, it is difficult for the Trial Chamber to get the interpretation of your utterances.  So please select one language into which you will testify.  This will make the interpreter's life easier and also our lives easier.  Have you understood me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Counsel, I understood you.  And I am going to choose to testify in Kinyarwanda.  It will be my working language.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Madam Witness, is it your testimony that the footage we saw all took place in Rwanda?  Just answer yes or no, because your answers are still a bit too long.  
A.	Well, if I may, I would not want to answer by yes or no because some of the pictures were shot in Rwanda and others were shot in the refugee camps in Zaire.  And this is why you must have seen some footage shot in Kibumba and in other camps where the refugees were. 
Q.	For the footage -- for the footage that was shot in the refugee camps, I would assume that that was footage after July of 1994.  Is that correct?  
A.	No.  The footage was not shot after July 1994 because some of the refugees arrived in the refugee camps somewhat earlier.  Those who could would cross the border.  But most of the pictures were shot after July.  They are pictures of refugees who had already settled in Congo. 
Q.	How much of the footage dates from the period between April and July of 1994?  
A.	I wish to say that when one produces a work of art, it is a collection of several pictures or photographs.  I cannot tell you that there are three or four or five pictures that were shot at a specific point in time.  I am not in a position to do that.  This is a work which we started in 1990, and we finalised it in 1994.  So I cannot tell you that there are five or six pictures that were taken at a specific point in time.  It is a work of art and it took us a while for it to be produced.  
Q.	Well, let me approach the subject matter in a different way, Madam Witness.  Tell us the various parts of Rwanda that you visited between the period April of 1994 and July of 1994.  
A.	From the month of April onwards, I told you that I moved around with other displaced persons, which means that I left Kigali, I went to Gitarama.  Subsequently, I went to Ngororero, to Kabaya, to Gisenyi, while waiting to cross the border.  So I went to the different places I just mentioned.  And well before that, because of my work, I knew all the regions of Rwanda.  
Q.	How much time did you spend in Gitarama?  Can you tell us when you were in Gitarama during that period?  I'm only talking about the period between April and July of 1994.  
A.	I would be hard-pressed to tell you on what date I arrived in Gitarama, but I can tell you that I stayed in Gitarama for one week.  And during that period I would not stay in a single spot.  For some time we lived in the town of Gitarama, and subsequently we went to settle in Bulinga, a commune of Gitarama préfecture.  And after that, we went to Ngororero.

1150H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Ngororero is in Gisenyi; is it not?  
A.	Ngororero is in the Gisenyi préfecture, but it has a common border with the Gitarama préfecture.  Many displaced persons settled in the Ngororero area.  
Q.	And, judging by your testimony-in-chief with Madam Diagne, you were in Gitarama on the 
	25th of May 1994; right?  
A.	Yes, on that date I was in Gitarama.  And it was there that I followed Karemera's installation ceremony as minister of the interior.  And Jean Kambanda (sic) had just been appointed minister of secondary education.  
Q.	You said Kambanda or Kamuhanda?  
A.	Yes, it was Kamuhanda who had just been appointed minister of tertiary education.  Jean Kamuhanda.  
Q.	Were you also in Gitarama on the 28th of May, when there was a meeting of préfets, along with the minister of the interior and the prime minister?  
A.	Yes, I was also in Gitarama when that meeting took place.  And we followed that meeting over the radio along with the others.
Q.	How long were you in Gitarama during that period?  Can you remember when you first arrived and when you left?  And I'm talking about this period, now, towards the end of May.  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, with all due respect, I told you that it was not easy for me to remember the date.  But I do recall that myself and the others, we remained in Gitarama for around one week, and I followed Édouard Karemera's oath-taking ceremony.  And there was also a meeting on the 28th of May, and I followed the proceedings of that meeting -- or, rather, I was following a report on this meeting.  
Q.	Were you working in Gitarama at the time?  What was the reason for your being present in Gitarama during that period?  
A.	I was not working during that period.  I was one of the war-displaced persons, and I was fleeing the fighting because the Inkotanyi had just chased us from our neighborhood in Kigali.  So I was among the population that was displaced.  And, since I had worked for the information service of the minister of the interior, and since I had worked for CARITAS, even though I no longer had the resources necessary to fulfill my tasks, I continued to take interest in what was happening and I wanted to have information on the developments in the situation.  

And we were thinking that we would be able to go back to our homes.  And this is the reason for which, whenever we would reach a specific location, we would say that we would not stay there for long or would not move from there.  And this is the reason for which I am not in a position to give you any precise date.  But I can assure you that I knew how the members of the public were surviving, because I was among them.  
Q.	So, at that point -- and here, the point I'm referring to, of course, is the end of May 1994 -- you had not yet arrived in Gisenyi, or you had not yet taken up temporary residence or shelter in Gisenyi; is that correct?  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I told you that I did not really remember the dates, but all I know is that we left Gitarama to go to Ngororero.  After Ngororero we went to Gisenyi.  After Gisenyi we crossed the border to Zaire.  
Q.	All right, Madam Witness.  I can appreciate that you can't remember the dates.  But it's not so much the specific dates that I'm looking for.  I'm trying to trace your itinerary from Kigali into exile, because, based on your direct evidence, your evidence -- the evidence that you gave for Madam Dior, I had the impression that you left Kigali, you passed through Gitarama, but that you settled most of the time in Gisenyi.  And now I'm hearing a different account.  So I'm trying to understand what your movement was over time.  

	So bearing that in mind, clarify things for us.  
A.	You are right.  I left Kigali.  I reached Gitarama.  After Gitarama, I took the road and reached Ngororero, where I spent a few days since war was raging.  From Ngororero, I went to Kabaya.  From Kabaya I went to Mukamira and from Mukamira to Nyundo, from Nyundo to Gisenyi, and then we crossed the border into Zaire.  So that was our itinerary. 

I am telling you that what I'm recounting is what I experienced.  So this was my itinerary and I saw all the things that happened during this journey.  So that was my itinerary to arrive in Zaire.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  And just to reiterate, because this was the premise of my question, on the 28th of May 1994 when you were monitoring what was said at the meeting of préfets that took place on that date, you were still in Gitarama and you had not yet taken up residence in Gisenyi; right? 
A.	One could listen to the oath ceremony even from afar.  But I told you that I closely followed the different oath ceremonies for the ministers who were becoming members of the government.  
Q.	Yes, Madam Witness.  But my previous question to you was whether you were in Gitarama on 
	the 25th of May when Karemera became the ministry of -- the minister of interior, and your answer was yes.  And you had previously stated that you remained in Gitarama while the meeting of préfets was taking place on the 28th of May.  

So I'm simply trying to get you to confirm, so that we're all clear, what your previous answers were.  So have I correctly stated your evidence?  
A.	What I am saying before this Court is that, with regard to the meeting that took place in Gitarama in May, I closely followed such meetings over the radio and I was in Gitarama.  So I followed the news since I was in Gitarama, and I was closely following the -- or listening to the programmes that were broadcast on the radio.  
Q.	Well, I thank you for that confirmation or for that clarification.  But what I suggest to you, 
	Madam Witness, is that you had a very different recollection of your displacements over time during the period April of 1994 to July of 1994 when you were giving information to Belgian authorities as part of your application for refugee status.  

Do you recall having been interviewed on at least two or three occasions by Belgian authorities when you applied to become a refugee in Belgium?  
A.	With regard to my file for the request of refugee status, I do not have it with me.  I fail to understand why you are referring to this file here before this Tribunal, since I have only come to testify on Karemera and not on my file.  
Q.	Well, perhaps the registry can assist us, because I do have your file.  And if the registry in your location could give you the document that bears K number K0448341.  It's a document that has a stamp on the first page of -- of the 2nd of December 1999.  
A.	Before I am given these documents, I would like to state something.  I have to say that I came to this Chamber for something else.  I didn't come here for my refugee status application file.  I believe I told the Chamber that I saw Karemera and that I never heard Karemera saying anti-Tutsi speeches.  I would, therefore, like to request that my refugee status application file should not be brought here, because that is not why I came to testify before this Chamber.  
Q.	Madam Witness, you came to this Chamber to tell the truth and to answer questions that would be put to you by the lawyers.  That's why you came to this Chamber.  And I have a question for you.  

On page 13 of that document, it is recorded that you told the person that was interviewing you that you left Kigali on the 8th of April, that you passed through Gitarama for one night or so, and that you spent the entire time of the genocide with your mother and father-in-law in Gisenyi in Satinski -- if I'm pronouncing it correctly -- your husband's home préfecture; isn't that so?
MS. MUZIGO-MORRISON:  
Mr. Prosecutor, could you please repeat the K number?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Madam Registrar, I don't think we need to look at the document.  I will read from it.  The K number for your -- but simply to answer your question, the K number is K0448341.  It's a document dated 1999.  It was in the first email collection of documents, the part one of the documents that I sent.  And it's the immigration interview of this witness, Agnés Mukarugomwa.  There are only two for her, and this is the one from 1999.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Madam Witness, you told the immigration authorities that you left Rwanda in 1994 because you were being prosecuted -- persecuted, excuse me -- because you were a Hutu and because you were an intellectual, and because of your activities with CARITAS, and that you went to Gisenyi after the RPF attacked your home in Kigali on the 7th of April, and that you remained presumably in Gisenyi until the 12th of July 1994, and you clarified for them that you had spent -- or you led them to believe that you spent that entire period at the home of your husband's parents.  

Is that what you told the immigration authorities?  
A.	As we speak, I still don't have that -- I still don't have that file.  And I would like to say that I do not see the reason why you're referring to my immigration file.  I came to this court only to talk about Édouard Karemera.  And the fact that I went to Ngororero to finally end up at my in-laws, it is true that I went to Ngororero, Kabaya, and ultimately Gisenyi before crossing the border.  With regard to that file, that immigration file, I don't have it and I don't see why I have to comment on it.  
Q.	Are you telling us that that is not what you told the immigration authorities back in 1999 and again in 2000?  
A.	I told you I no longer recall the specific dates at which I was in Gitarama, but all I can confirm is that I was in Gitarama in May.  I also confirmed that I heard, over radio, Karemera's oath-taking ceremony and I also heard reports on the -- the meeting of -- of the meeting which held in Gitarama over the radio, and that the authorities had said that the roadblocks had to be lifted so that the members of the population could move about easily, and that the radio announced that the members of the population had to be assisted, that is to say, the displaced members of the population had to be helped.  I, therefore, confirm that all -- everything that was said on the radio, I heard.  
Q.	All right, Madam Witness.  We'll leave the issue of the difference between what you told the immigration authorities and what you told this Chamber about where you were during the war and what you did.  Let's talk a bit about those meetings.  You mentioned that you followed the speech of 
	Prime Minister Kambanda after the meeting of the 28th of May.  So let's talk about that for a bit.  

Would you agree that, from what you could observe in Gitarama and in the various places that you visited during April through July of 1994, that there were massacres against the civilian Tutsi population? 
A.	I didn't quite get your question.  I wonder if you're talking about the content of the prime minister's speech or if you want to know if I witnessed the massacres.  

Could you be so kind as to repeat your question?  
Q.	I'll do so.  I will get to the prime minister's speech.  Before I ask you questions about his speech, I want to ask you a more general question.  

You've told us about the problems of the displaced persons fleeing the war.  And now I want to ask you about the problems of the killings that were taking place during the war, the killings of civilians.  
You would agree with me, would you not, that in April and May of 1994, there were attacks against civilians and specifically against the Hutu -- against the Tutsi in the places that you visited, in Gitarama, in Ngororero, in Gisenyi, in Kigali?  

It's a simple proposition.  Do you agree with that?  
A.	All I can say with respect to the massacres is that the massacres were not perpetrated only in the months of April and May.  The massacres, indeed, began on 1 October 1990, after the RPF Inkotanyi attack, which entered the country.  These were not lambs; they were the short bullets and people got killed.  So, in the months of April and May, although there was completely chaos in the country, there was no control, no authority.  All roads were filled with refugees and people killed each other. 
Q.	Madam Witness -- 
A.	Therefore, I cannot claim that I witnessed the massacres of the Tutsis.  I can simply assert that Rwandans died.  Even people who were not Rwandan, such as Caucasians and Congolese, were killed from 1990 up until the time when we left the country.  
Q.	Madam Witness, all I'm suggesting to you is that in April and May, the period when Édouard Karemera was either minister of the interior or had a senior function within the MRND party, there were massacres against civilians which the government or the MRND party should have stopped or controlled.  Do you agree with me?  
A.	Yes, people died.  But -- but Tutsi civilians were not the only people to have been killed.  I equally have to state that the authority was divided amongst many political parties.  And it wasn't only the MRND that governed.  You had the United Nations, which was on the ground.  The international community was there.  Nobody was able to halt the massacres.  The members of the population who had been suffering for four years previous to that time, nobody stopped the killings, unless the Inkotanyi were arrested, because they caused all of that.  Because, had the Inkotanyi not attacked, all those massacres wouldn't have taken place. 
Q.	Yes.  But you're avoiding the most obvious observation for that period, Madam Witness.  

Are you disputing that there was a genocide of the Tutsi, that Tutsi was specifically targeted for attack, that they were targeted for attack and actually attacked by Interahamwe and militias?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I would like to stick to the UN's definition of the word "genocide".  It is not 
	"genocide of Tutsi; it was "genocide of Rwandans".  It is, rather, "genocide of Rwandans" that the United Nations adopted.  For legal minds, the word "genocide" means "planned massacres".

I would, therefore, like to ask the Chamber to tell me the person who planned these massacres which led to the extermination of Rwandans.  You have legal minds, so you have to cross-check what happened from 1990 in Muvumba and Nyaconga and take a look at the statistics or the members of the population who died.  Even after the destruction of the refugee camps in Rwanda, count.  Check out the statistics.  You would be able to know what genocide was about.  As far as I'm concerned, it was a genocide of Rwandans.  
I would like to tell you that I personally lost loved ones.  People I know who are with you in Arusha also lost loved ones.  So look for the person who planned that genocide.  I know that sooner or later, maybe not in my lifetime, that person will be known.
Q.	All right.  
A.	Maybe while I'm alive or while I am dead.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Mr. Registrar, if you could distribute the first document that I'm going to refer to.  I already provided copies to the interpreters.  This is the document that I've numbered, number one.  It's dated 
	the 28th of May 1994.  And this is the radio broadcast of Kambanda's speech following the meeting that the witness referred to.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Madam Witness, I'm going to read to you what Kambanda said, and you tell me if this is what you remember.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Excuse me.  Your Honour, if the Prosecutor has documents he intends to use during his cross-examination, why does he do it in such a step by step, since he's talking about disclosure?  And could he tell us if he has documents he wants to disclose to the other parties so that we should be able to follow what he is doing?  He shouldn't give them step by step. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
My assumption was that the registry had sent all of these documents to the parties and to the Chamber by email.  If I'm incorrect, Mr. Hometowu can correct me.  I have the documents here printed.  I was trying to save on the distribution of paper, but I certainly am not trying to withhold them from the parties.  I can give them out in hard copy if that would facilitate matters.  But I would assume that everyone has them on the laptops.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Your Honour, we did not disclose the documents to the parties.  We received instructions from the OTP asking us not to do so, and so they advised us accordingly. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I believe the instructions were to disclose them after the witness completed her direct examination, and the email should reflect that.  But I have copies here which I can certainly make available to everyone.  Give me one second.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, could you please note the Prosecutor's acts, his ambush, his way of ambushing us and then coming here to give us lessons.  We know how the registrar works.  It is well done.  But now, when it is not clear -- the issue was raised here a few minutes ago.  He told us something was not understandable.  And this was done on purpose, Mr. President.  And I think he has to be sanctioned.  He will -- it is likely he is going to carry on with this attitude.  But we need to put this on the record because this does not serve anything.  It is going to -- the truth is going to come out. 

The second comment I would like to make:  How long my interrogation in chief -- my examination-in-chief lasted, and then also note how long the Prosecutor's cross-examination is taking, and then end up by saying that he should not give us -- he should stop giving -- trying to be pedantic because that is what he has been doing for too long.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, I think I can complete this examination in another 20 minutes.  What I would suggest is that I distribute the documents to the parties now and that I complete my cross-examination after a break period.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, you have to finish before lunch.  We're not coming back this afternoon.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Well, I'll proceed.  I don't have the documents organised in a way that I can distribute them now.  So I'm just going to have to hand them out piecemeal.  But if Mr. Hometowu could send the email, which is what I actually requested that he do, then everyone can look at the documents on their laptops.  So if I can --  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, I must tell you, this is not how we expect things to be done.  We expect that, at the beginning of your cross-examination, you distribute the documents to the parties.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's the understanding that we have.  And that is what I think everybody in court expects.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I will certainly do that from now on.  But I recall the last time that we discussed this, the Chamber suggested that the materials be distributed electronically, which is what I did.  Apparently, the court management misunderstood the email communication, but everything was sent out yesterday with instructions that it be transmitted to the parties after the witness completed her direct examination.  So I'll continue.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Madam Witness, I'm going to read to you what Jean Kambanda said on the 28th of May 1994.  And I will read in French, as it is the only translation -- the only edition that is available.  So speaking in French --  
MS. MUZIGO-MORRISON:  
The witness does not have the document before her.  

MR. WEBSTER: 
This is the document bearing K number K074 -- and it ends in 83.  And I will read it.  On page 25 of the text:  

"Regarding the stop of massacres, I explained to the préfet that -- that there isn't.  And they know as well as I do, as they are the officials on the field, that there are no massacres in the country.  There was an RPF attack in all the préfectures, that the RPF -- the fighting was carrying on in a certain number of préfectures, but not in all of them, and that there was relative calm in most of the préfectures which is under government control." 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Is that what you recall Kambanda saying when you heard him on the 28th of May?  
A.	Yes, he said that.  However, I can't say people were not dying.  At that time when the RPF entered the countries, they were not docile angels.  They were also killing.  They were causing people to be displaced and to seek refuge in refugee camps.  And they used bullets that killed.  

Personally, I would like to say that all along the period from 1 October 1990, when people left their homes, they left their property because they were scared of bullets.  They were dying.  People were being killed.  
Q.	Yes.  
A.	So I don't know what you call attacks. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I do not -- I simply want to suggest to the Prosecutor that when he's reading a document, that he should not stop.  Because the document which he has just read is longer than that, and it is more revealing of what he -- with respect to what he wants to get from the witness.  It's unfortunate that he stopped where he stopped, because had he continued reading, we would have -- the Chamber would have been mortified.  I would, therefore, advise the Prosecutor not to cut and paste parts of the passages so that we should get a whole understanding of the document.  

It is a proposal, Mr. Prosecutor.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Mr. Nimy -- 

	Or, Your Honour, I would suggest that the Defence will have an opportunity to revisit these issues in their redirect examination, as I do plan to go into more of the document.  If Mr. Nimy would exercise a bit of patience, he would realise that I'm going into much more than the paragraph that I've just read.  So I would like to continue with the witness.  

BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Madam Witness, it seems to me that you and the prime minister actually give the same account of events.  In your previous answers, you seem to evade the question or the issue of the civilian Tutsi population being attacked.  And here we have Prime Minister Kambanda, after meeting with his 
	minister of interior and the préfets of the country, announcing to the nation on Radio Rwanda on 
	the 28th of May 1994 that there were no massacres to stop.  
A.	What I would like to say, as the lawyer has just stated, I believe that you jumped a paragraph.  If you let me, I would read it in French.  

If you allow me, let me refer to a few examples.  The fact that the Byumba préfecture was emptied, a préfecture which had about 800,000 people, and now there are only 150,000, the question I asked myself was:  Where did the 650,000 other people go to?  

Now, I can continue reading.  The prime minister was wondering where 650,000 other people had gone to.  What I would like to say therefore is that the massacres began with the RPF attacks.  I would like the truth to be known that, as a matter of fact, the massacres began with the RPF attacks and that with the RPF attacks, people died.  The situation became disastrous until the time when we left the country.  
Q.	Yes, Madam Witness.  And I can see that you're in complete agreement with the prime minister when he was speaking back on the 28th of May, because he had just finished meeting with his 
	minister of interior and the préfets, presumably those in the government-controlled areas.  And we would also presume that the purpose of the meeting was to restore security in government-controlled areas.  But yet, we have the leader of the government announcing to the rest of the nation that there were no killings.  He said that there were no massacres.  And he said that there was relative calm in the government-controlled areas.  And then to address the issue of massacres, he talked about Byumba, which was not under government control.  

So what I suggest to you is that both of you are on the same wavelength.  Neither of you want to comment on what was obvious at the time.  
A.	Also what I can say personally is that when the population of Byumba, or the inhabitants of Byumba started fleeing, I went there on several occasions.  And, in fact, when they were at the refugee camp, they had abandoned members of their families or they had already lost some of their family members who had been killed.  If I refer to this document mentioned as made of the dead bodies that had been seen in Lake Victoria, I know that the Kigali government travelled -- or, rather, went outside the country in order to bury these bodies in an honorable way.  Let's just say that those were victims of the genocide.  

What I can say is that since the RPF attacked until the time we went into exile, people were killed, and all that because of the RPF.  Properties were destroyed, people were killed.  So I am saying that, in all the locations where the people who were fleeing passed through, people would die.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If I could refer to the second document in my bundle, and if Mr. Issa could distribute these to the parties, please.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, could the documents be disclosed to us, the documents that are currently being used by the Prosecutor?  Is there a problem?  Can't the documents be disclosed to us, Mr. President, in spite of the relevant reminder you made earlier on to counsel for the Prosecution?   
MS. MUZIGO-MORRISON:  
Mr. Prosecutor, could you provide us with the number?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
This is an exhibit -- this is a document that has already been admitted in evidence.  It's P. 252.  In the English text, the first K number is K0364084.  In French, the K number is K0338783.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President -- but, Mr. President, I wish to make sure that counsel for the Prosecution no longer has any other documents disclosed.  Because if such is the case, could he give them all to us right now before he takes the floor again?  Right now.  Is there a problem?  Can't counsel for the Prosecution disclose the documents now if they are in his possession, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I must say we have just accessed the documents on our email.  And we realise that the registrar has just forwarded them.  So we have access to them in that manner now.  

Do you have access to your email in court?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
We have access to our email, but I must inform you that the email has not reached us because the system is very slow, and when the document reaches us, it will probably be too late.  

So, Mr. President, this is not the way we should proceed.  We all know how fast the Tribunal's computer system works, and so we cannot merely deal with that.  And the truth of it is that the time we're talking, counsel for the Prosecution has the document and the Defence teams, in general, do not have the document.  This is confirmed by all the Defence teams.  

So are you going to authorise such a situation, Mr. President?  I do not believe so.

Mr. President, I have a question that has remained unanswered regarding the time I spent on my examination-in-chief and how much time is left to counsel for the Prosecution for his cross-examination.  
Mr. Constant, could you give us some kind of indication?  Thank you. 
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Mr. President, unfortunately, the registry did not take down the time, and we would not be in a position at this time to give any information on that.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, I have the documents reproduced here.  I can give them all to the registry and they can do their best to distribute them.  I think there will be less confusion if I hand them out piecemeal, because -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, the whole point of giving the documents in time is to facilitate reexamination.  We don't intend to adjourn.  So if the registry cannot -- if the parties can have access to the document, it will facilitate everybody's work in the chamber.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
How many documents do you intend to use now?  How many? I've seen that huge bundle.  How many documents do you actually intend to use?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
At least three. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could you send those three, please?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, despite the fact that registry has not accounted for the time spent during examination-in-chief, I believe you will concur with me that Prosecution has gone well beyond the time I spent on my examination-in-chief for a long time now.  And if you concur with me, Mr. President, please draw the necessary conclusions.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Madam Witness -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, we think Ms. Diagne is correct.  We had asked you to conclude your cross-examination by lunchtime. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, there are certain difficulties that arise, given the logistical hurdle of trying to examine the witness through the video camera.  In addition, if the Court has received the email that I sent yesterday, it should be clear that my instructions were that that was to be distributed as soon as the witness finished her direct evidence.  Now I'm doing the best that I can under the circumstances.  

I had requested earlier that I be given a moment to distribute the documents so that things could proceed in a more orderly fashion, and I was unable to do that.  So if the Court can suggest what my time limitation is, then I'll work within that.  And when I have run out of time, I will simply sit down.  But I thought my examination was assisting the Court.  If it's not doing that, then we need not continue.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, you have already issued an order -- a scheduling order for the examination-in -- examinations-in-chief and cross-examinations in this courtroom.  I fail to see what constraints are entailed by a video conference examination or cross-examination.  I do not understand what counsel for the Prosecution means unless he explains.  And then you will be in a position to assess.  But as long as this has not been done, Mr. President, you cannot authorise him to continue cross-examining the witness, especially on the basis of the documents being disclosed to us.  He will need at least 
	half an hour if not one hour.  

Mr. President, this is not normal.  This goes against the substance of the order you have issued regarding examinations-in-chief and cross-examinations in this courtroom.  And, in order for the rulings that you issued on this matter to be complied with, I believe he should be ordered to stop, especially since we have gone past the break time.  And I wonder how we are going to proceed as well as the other parties in this case.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, now that we have reviewed these documents, these don't actually arise from cross-examination.  What this seems to be is you're now seeking to put in material in proof of your case because this witness has said she listened to radio broadcast.  And you're trying to put in material from radio broadcast which she may or may not (inaudible) out of that.  

Now, in view of the time constraints, we don't think we should allow you to -- this is going to take some time.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I'll follow the Court's instructions.  The document is already in evidence.  This is P. 252 in evidence already.  So I'm simply confronting the witness with inconsistencies -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But why do you need to do that if it's already in evidence?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Because I want to see what the witness -- how the witness responds to the information that she claims she heard.  If the Court does not find it useful, Your Honour, we can end.  I was trying to assist the Court by examining -- probing the witness's credibility on a specific point that she mentioned in her direct evidence.  

She mentioned being present in Gitarama on the 25th of May and on the 28th of May and hearing what the prime minister and what the minister of interior said over the radio.  Here, we have the 
radio broadcast.  And what I would like to suggest to the witness is that what she claimed she heard and what was actually said were two different things.  I can do that in argument at the end of the case, because the transcript is already in evidence.  So that's not the issue.  I'm simply probing the issue with the witness.  If it's not helpful, we can end this right now.  

If the Court will look at page 26 on the English text, it's the 3rd paragraph under item number two.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
If I may, the Trial Chamber is deliberating, Counsel for the Prosecution.  You cannot just go ahead and put questions.  

Mr. President, I believe you're right.  In any case, the text is from a speaker who is here and who will be in the box next week, and you will have ample opportunity to get all the information you require on the document.  And I do not see how this document can be shown to this witness and in what way it impinges on the witness's credibility.  So the Chamber has already ruled on this issue and doesn't see the need to show such documents to the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, it's not exactly the point that this is not legally admissible.  But the point is:  This is not what the witness testified about, and the information is already on the record.  So, in terms of our overall management, we don't think it's useful to continue with that at this stage.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, with this witness, I have no problem closing my cross-examination.  But I am perturbed by the precedent that the Court may be establishing with this particular ruling.  

Under Rule 90 of our rules, it states that the Prosecution may -- excuse me -- Rule 90(G)(ii), I believe it is -- or if we look at (G)(i), (ii), (iii), it allows the party cross-examining a witness to adduce evidence during cross-examination which corroborates or reinforces evidence presented during its case.  

There's a specific holding on that particular issue from the Bagosora -- it's Prosecutor v. Bagosora decision for request of severance of three accused of the 27th of March 2006.  There's also a decision from the Butare case on that very issue. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, there's no need for that jurisprudence.  I just said that it's not something that you -- that will be permitted.  The point is you have exceeded your time limit, we don't think it's particularly useful, and the information is already on the record.  

MR. WEBSTER: 
All right. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, in terms of the relative value of doing it, it doesn't seem to us to justify continuing with the cross-examination of this witness. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay.  That's fine.  

I would, however, introduce into evidence two exhibits.  It's the -- the immigration record that I used in my cross-examination, as well as the -- the excerpt -- the radio broadcast with comments from 
Jean Kambanda that I read a few minutes ago.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Registrar.  
MR. MJUI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  The immigration document will be P. 347.  And the next document will be 
P. 348.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. P. 347 admitted)
(Exhibit No. P. 348 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is there anything else?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, I'm sure that all of us in this courtroom are hungry.  It is almost 1 o'clock.  I -- I'm not going to have any re-examination of this witness.  I will merely request from the Trial Chamber that it admit into evidence the footage of the DVD that was played in this room, the work produced by 
	Witness Agnès, who made extensive comments on it.  And it will be -- 

Exhibit number, Mr. Issa?  

With your leave, Mr. President.
MR. MJUI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  The document -- the excerpt will be D. K118. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. K118 admitted)  

MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
I am done, Mr. President.  I merely wish to be given the opportunity to thank the witness for having kindly accepted to contribute to the work of justice.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Ms. Diagne. 

And, Madam Witness, The Tribunal also thanks you for testifying and assisting the Tribunal with its work, but your testimony is now completed and you're now excused.  
MS. MUZIGO-MORRISON:  
May it please the Court, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, please.  I'm listening.  
MS. MUZIGO-MORRISON: 
The Defence counsel has not done anything with the document identifying the witness.  We have not had it signed or anything. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We think that the witness's oral testimony about who she is would be sufficient for the record.  I don't know if we need to have the document admitted.  
MS. MUZIGO-MORRISON:  
Thank you.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Yes, indeed, Mr. President, because she gave her particulars during her examination-in-chief and everything was included in the transcripts.  And this is the reason for which it is not necessary to have an additional exhibit that would contain the very same information.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  We think so.  

Now, Ms. Diagne, we understand that the other witness scheduled for today is not available.  What is the position?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, the situation is that that witness had -- was to be examined today and two other witnesses for tomorrow because they were able to organise themselves and go to the Hague according to the authorisation given to them by their respective witnesses. 

Witness TZL had already said that on the 12th, that is to say, today, this afternoon, he was operating on three patients in his clinic and that it would only be afterwards that he would come to the Hague.  The second witness had already said, after asking for leave to his employer, that his employer was authorising him to have his leave on the -- tomorrow, sorry, that is to say, the 13th of May.  So there have been no last-minute changes on the programme, Mr. President.  Things are taking place as originally planned.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, we will take our adjournment now.  And we will resume tomorrow morning. 
(Court adjourned at 1255H)
