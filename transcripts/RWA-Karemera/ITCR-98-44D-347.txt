EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. WEYL: 
Q.	And good morning, Witness. 
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	Let me remind you, as the President said, that you're under oath and that we're also operating -- still operating under the same rules.  

And just to refresh your memory you need to speak slowly for the sake of the interpretation and for the court stenographers.  You also need to pause after my questions.  Don't respond immediately, because the interpretation has to finish with my question before you start answering.

Witness, Wednesday afternoon we were examining events that occurred in your commune in the morning of the 8th April 1994.  Are you able to remind us of the events that occurred and also describe to us the prevailing institution in your commune on that 8th April 1994? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Eighth April, as I said last week, the morning of that day, around 8 a.m., I saw the chief of the communal police called Ruhiguri.  He came and told me that in the 
	Gahini secteur, Umwiga cellule, a certain Tutsi family had been attacked and there may have been deaths.

Immediately, and with him, we went to the site.  I got there and I realised that a group of bandits from the Gahini secteur had attacked a certain Tutsi family.  They had attacked the family of one Rugomwa, who was a teacher at the Gahini school of arts.  And these bandits killed the wife.  I did not see the wife's body.  She was called Anatalie.  I did not see her body, because her body had been trans -- had been taken to the mortuary in the Gahini hospital.

I went down about 100 metres and also I saw again that this group of evildoers had killed one 
François Shabayiro, his wife Dina, as well as two -- two of Dina's children.  I was very disturbed and sad.  

I called the neighbouring -- I called the neighbours to ask them what happened.  When I spoke to 
them -- to the neighbours of these families, they told me that around 2000 hours they heard whistles being blown and grenade explosions.  They got frightened and each one went into hiding in their homes.  

Immediately, I asked the conseiller of the Gahini secteur -- his name was Butera, Jean-Bosco -- I asked him to tell me what happened.  He told me that he also heard the explosion of grenades but that he was afraid to go to the site to see what was happening.  I told him immediately to conduct an investigation, to identify the perpetrators.  And that I, on my part, was going immediately to Rwamagana.  Rwamagana is R-W-A-M-A-G-A-N-A.   

The sous-préfecture of the commune was at Rwamagana.  And since I had no means of communication, there was no possibility of communication from Rukara, so I had to go through Rwamagana and Rumukara (sic) in a vehicle together with the chief of the communal police.  I immediately went to Rwamagana to inform my immediate supervisors, particularly the sous-préfet and the préfet of Kibungo, so they can send me gendarmes to assist me search, conduct investigations and arrest the perpetrators of the crime.  

At Rwamagana I found the sous-préfet called Léonidas Gakuliro.  Gakuliro is G-A-K-U-L-I-R-O.  I found him in his office and I told him about what happened in Rukara; that unidentified groups -- or groups as yet unidentified had started off violence in Rukara.  And I had to inform the préfet who was called Ruzindana, Godefroid.  Ruzindana is R-U-Z-I-N-D-A-N-A.  

The sous-préfet picked the phone, informed the préfet, and then gave me the phone to explain to the préfet in detail what happened.  He told me to deploy all possible means to stop the violence had -- that had started in the commune.  I told him that he had to assist me by putting gendarmes at my disposal, as well as any other forces that would assist me to carry out my investigations and arrest the perpetrators of the crime.  

With the sous-préfet, we went to see the commander of the gendarmerie.  We found him and I told him what had happened.  I told him that I needed an intervention force made up of gendarme to carry out investigations and immediately arrest the crime perpetrators.

Since the commander had withdrawn, the gendarme assigned to the commune on the 7th, he told me that several of the gendarme were on the war front and that he was going to inform his supervisors, so that he can put gendarmes at my disposal to help me in the investigations that I was going to carry out to arrest the perpetrators. 
Q.	Witness, at this stage maybe you can give us a clarification.  You were making reference to the need for you to have the assistance of gendarmes to face up to the situation that you were encountering in your commune.  Without these gendarmes, what was the number of persons you had at your disposal to stop -- or to -- to re-establish order -- to maintain -- maintain order in your commune? 
A.	In the Rukara commune, I had seven policemen in all.  But during that period of crisis, that very day, I had only five policemen at my disposal.  Since there had been displaced persons who had arrived at the parish on the 7th, I had policemen who were to ensure the security of the refugees at the 
	Rukara commune.  So I had only five policemen at my disposal, and they were deployed in case of security.  

And, according to my supervisors, the instruction was that in case of crisis or violence, I had to go for some gendarme because the policemen at my disposal were not enough to deal with the perpetrators of the crime.  So I had two of the policemen guarding the refugees at the parish and I had only five of them at my disposal.  And that is why I needed to inform my supervisors to send me a detachment of gendarme to restore order. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  

On the morning of the 8th were you able to -- did they give you this reinforcement and what were the measures taken by your supervisors? 
A.	The commander of the gendarmerie did not immediately respond to my request.  He told me that the bulk of his men were on the war front and that he had only a small number of gendarme.  That he was going to inform his supervisors so that the few men left could be put at my disposal.  

So in that morning I did not get the gendarme to assist me.  Since he told me to wait for him to inform his supervisors, I went back immediately to Rukara to try and use the meagre resources at my disposal to restore order.  I immediately went to Gahini where the violence had started.  

When I got there at a small centre near the hospital -- a small centre called Akabeza.  
Akabeza is A -- I'm sorry -- A-K-A-B-E-Z-A.  It is at that very place that I held a meeting with the 
local residents and to tell them that the killings that had been committed were heinous and that that had to stop.  And that is where I gave orders to the conseiller de secteur to start the investigations.  

When I got there, I did not see the conseiller.  I was informed that the group of evildoers, the delinquents, had attacked another cellule of Gahini called Ibiza, I-B-I-Z-A.  Ibiza.

Immediately, and with the chief of the communal police, I went to the scene.  When I got there I realised that Tutsi houses had been demolished, had been torched.  And when I was moving, I saw this 
gang of evildoers and when they saw me arriving they ran into banana plantations, the woods, and I was not able to arrest any one of them.  I was going from one house to the other without being able to arrest anyone.  Given the fact that I had only one policeman with me and they were dispersing, spreading all over the place, and I could not do anything.  I was disturbed and I could not arrest anybody.  

They left only -- they left behind only children.  And when I asked them what had happened they told me that they had been threatened by those evildoers if they -- if they ever denounced them, they were going to kill them.

Everybody was afraid.  And since I was overwhelmed by the situation, I decided immediately to, once again -- and see a commander to send me gendarmes to stop the violence.

What I realised is that wherever I went, I did not meet Tutsis.  They had all taken refuge at the 
Rukara parish.  So, first, I went to the parish where the Tutsis had assembled to ask them if they were able to identify the persons who attacked them and torched their houses.  They told me that they heard that the violence had erupted in the Umwiga-Gahini secteur, and that they left.  

And during that period there was a press release on RPF Radio Muhabura saying that ever if they were threatened the Tutsis should seek refuge in the churches and the public places, such as the 
Gahini hospital.  That is what they told me.  Some of them came because they had been told by 
Radio Muhabura that they should go there when they were threatened.

At the parish, since there was a lot of tension among the refugees who were there, I thought it was necessary to have security people there.  So I went to see the commander of the gendarmes again and inform him of the need to have gendarmes at the place.  I informed the parish priests, because there were thousands of Tutsis and some Hutu families who had taken refuge at the parish, because the panic was general.  I told him that I was going to Rwamagana to ask for reinforcement for the policemen -- the few policemen that I had.  He told me that he will accompany me to try and convince the préfecture authorities.  We took his vehicle and we went to Rwamagana.  

At the commander's office, I told him how the security situation had worsened in the commune.  He told me that he was going to place the few gendarme -- and place them at my disposal, and that he was going to look for a vehicle to bring them to Rukara.  He told me to go back immediately to Rukara and that in the hours that followed he would send gendarmes to come and assist me. 
Q.	Witness, at this stage I'd like to ask you for some clarifications.  On several occasions when you made reference to the 8th April attacks, you stated that these acts were carried out by bandits, groups of by evildoers.  Can you tell us what you meant when you make reference to such groups?  Were these individuals, organised groups? 
A.	I said these were delinquents who had gathered -- constituted themselves into groups of petty criminals.  At the time I had not yet identified them.  I was carrying out my investigations and I was doing everything to be able to identify these people.  These were thieves, petty criminals, who were taking advantage of the Tutsis who had left their properties to loot their belongings and bring chaos to a situation that was already tense among the population. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You also said that there were -- there was an announcement on Radio Muhabura that advised Tutsis to take refuge at the parish.  What was the reaction of the people in your commune in relation to this gathering at the parish? 
A.	Let me clarify that Radio Muhabura that was broadcasting this information that Tutsis, when threatened, should find -- take refuge in churches, that this movement of Tutsis to the church -- this movement was considered by a portion of the population as a gathering point so they can attack them.  

The young Tutsis had been trained at Mulindi at the RPF headquarters, who had come to live among the population and who were moving to the churches.  The Hutu population -- the Hutu residents who were living on the hills considered this place as a rallying point so that if the RPF arrived -- because the RPF had already started advancing -- and the news or the announcement was to the effect that people were considering the churches as a rallying point, and that if the RPF arrived, they were going to attack them in their houses.  

That is the first observation I made among the Hutus who remained in their houses on the hills. 
Q.	Witness, if I understood you, and let me try to summarise what you said, and correct me if I'm -- I did not get it correctly.  

Now, on account of Radio Muhabura's announcement, the gathering of persons in the churches was seen as a threat by residents of your commune who saw them gathering in the churches.  Did I understand you clearly? 
A.	Yes.  They considered that as a threat, because this was a threat that was issued on several occasions by these young Tutsis who had been trained.  The Tutsi who had gone to the CND - CND is.where the RPF contingent was stationed in Kigali in the national assembly.  Some of the Tutsis went to visit members of their family.  

Let me add that the commander of that contingent -- RPF contingent, one Kayonga, Charles, was a native of Rukara.  So his relatives would often go and meet him.  And he probably told them -- I don't know -- he probably told them that the RPF was going to slaughter the Hutus, and this was being said by the young people.  It was a threat.  

So when they started gathering in the churches, they were saying that the threat that they issued was going to be implemented.  And that is how the local residents saw this gathering in the churches. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.

Witness, you spoke about the presence of camps of displaced persons in your commune on the 
8th of April 1994.  What to your knowledge was the prevailing situation in the displaced-persons' camps set up around your commune? 
A.	From the 7th of April, the RPF had started advancing.  They left their containment and started moving into the hinterland of the country, because there were places that were called buffer areas.  There was the military camp of Gabiro where the Rwandan armed forces were stationed and they had been displaced and had set up their headquarters in the Murambi -- at Murambi -- in Murambi commune in the secondary school called APECOM.

The RPF had started shelling refugee camps.  And also in the commune there was movement of persons -- war-displaced persons who were established in Murambi in February 1993.  And as the RPF had just destroyed their camp, and since they had been shelled and displaced, these people were also moving and generating chaos among the Rukara population.  

And towards the 12th of April, these persons who came from the displaced camp attacked the parish, that is, the Tutsis who had taken refuge at the Rukara parish.  As a result of that, there was more violence, more tension, and the situation had become uncontrollable. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.

Maybe to go back to the chronology of your account, on the 8th of April, were you able to control the situation in Rukara, or insecurity persisted? 
A.	The insecurity persisted, because in the evening, around 1800 hours, I saw the gendarme who had arrived.  It was a very small number, only five of them.  They came, found me at the parish with the communal policemen and I showed them the people to be protected.  I showed them the buildings where -- in which the people had taken refuge.  

Besides, at that time, the director of the Gahini hospital had sent a colleague, a lady, a woman called Elizabeth Harding.  She was a British citizen who was working at the Gahini hospital.  The director of the hospital sent her to the commune to ask for policemen or gendarme to help with the security at the Gahini hospital because there were people who were hiding in the hospital.  

When I saw the gendarme I told them that they had to guard the refugees at the parish and also refugees at the Gahini hospital.  

After showing them the location at the Rukara parish, we went up to the hospital where they also -- they had to ensure the security of people who had taken refuge there.

I told them that they could split themselves into two groups, one group at the parish and the other group at the hospital.  There's a distance of 10 kilometres between the hospital and the parish.  They are not that close together.  So the leader of the group was a sergeant, and he told me that they cannot form two groups because that would weaken their forces.  He said that they would need a vehicle so they can shuttle between the two places, that is, the parish and the Gahini hospital.  

I went to the hospital, showed them the hospital building.  And then I told them that they have to ensure the security of those places together with the communal police.  And since I was overwhelmed, tired, and since I had seen the security men, I went home to take some rest.  That was on the 
8th of April 1994. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.

Mr. Witness, did you succeed to restore calm in your commune on the 9th of April, or did the situation persist? 
A.	The situation went worse from day to day.  It worsened from day to day.  

On the 9th April I was near the Rukara communal office at about 9 a.m.  That lady whom I referred to, known as Elizabeth Harding, a British national, was sent by Dr. Wilson and she met me in front of the communal office and told me that the Gahini hospital was under threat, that it had been surrounded by a group of hoodlums, and she asked me to intervene.  

So I told her that I had posted gendarmes at that location and I was wondering what they had been up to.  In any event, I told her that I was going to go to the location myself to find out what was happening.

So I promptly boarded a vehicle with Brigadier Ruhiguri, who was the head of the communal police.  And when we got to the hospital, I found that the hospital had been attacked by those criminals.  And I was able to note that three people had been killed at the hospital which had come under attack.  They had jumped over the fence and attacked the hospital and people were killed.  

But upon arrival they jumped out and ran away.  Out of the five gendarmes who had been assigned to provide security, they had all fled, except one.  So I asked him what had happened and he told me that he had been overwhelmed by the attackers and was not able to do anything.  So I too was overwhelmed by the situation and I needed to absolutely report to the commander that his 
gendarmes -- the gendarmes he had assigned to me had been inefficient.
So, once again, I returned to the Rwamagana gendarmerie office in the company of that lady, 
Elizabeth Harding.  And according to what she had told me, she wanted to contact her family to inform them about the situation that was obtaining at her location.  So I went with her.  And I told the communal police chief, who had escorted me and the gendarme, I told both of them that it is unacceptable for people to have been killed where forces of law and order had been posted or assigned.  

So on -- on that note, I went to the Rwamagana gendarmerie to look for reinforcement.  I went to the sous-préfet.  We went to the gendarmerie office.  I narrated to him the acts of violence that had been committed at Rukara.  And I asked them to come see for themselves what was happening.

I was overwhelmed by the situation and that is how the gendarmerie commander, the sous-préfet -- the gendarmerie commander and sous-préfet went to Rukara to have a hands-on assessment for themselves of the situation prevailing at the time and establish that the acts of violence had not ended.  Acts of violence continued.  There was disorder.  There was chaos.  The entire population and war-displaced persons who had flooded into Rukara -- believe me, you cannot know how difficult things were for us.  

In brief therefore, the situation did not improve.  Rather, it worsened from day to day in spite of the presence of the forces of law and order, in spite of all my efforts to curb the violence. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have used some very specific words and have painted a picture of the violence and the -- the population that was flowing into your area.  And you mentioned that you were overwhelmed.  You also said that the gendarme who was in charge of security also said that they had been overwhelmed by the people who had attacked.

Now, at that time, Mr. Witness, did those who attack, did those who overwhelmed you, did those who made things so difficult for you, include persons who could have been identified as 
Interahamwe za MRND? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Let me tell you that there were no Interahamwe in Rukara.  There was no organisation, no body or structure known as the Interahamwe.  That expression Interahamwe has its origins in -- or was used by a -- a group of animators or performers who would perform and dance to folkloric music at various MRND rallies.  That performance group was made up of persons of all ages including men, women, youths, and what have you.  They performed at MRND rallies and took on the name Interahamwe.

And so this is what was known as Interahamwe in Kigali.  Therefore, there was no Interahamwe among the group of attackers.  I did not see any Interahamwe.  And as it's generally defined, the Interahamwe did not exist in Rukara.

Allow me, furthermore, to specify that at the time of the event, at the time of those killings, I had not yet identified those people.  I had began some investigations.  I had not abandoned them.  When we left the country -- when we were thrown out of the country and I got to a refugee camp in Tanzania, I continued to conduct my investigations and I was able to note that those who I referred to as delinquents or hoodlums were not necessarily Interahamwe.  They were not necessarily members of the MRND party, because that fraction of the population which was indisciplined and which attacked Tutsis included persons belonging to other political parties.  

The leaders of the group whom I was able to identify included one Ruvugo, Thaddée, who was a soldier, a president of the MRND and an arts lecturer in Gahini.  He was not of the MRND.  I can also mention one Mutsinzi, Jean Bosco, a former soldier, who had been dismissed from the military academy in Kigali.  He was a teacher at the school of arts in Gahini.  He was a member of the PSD.  He was not a member of the MRND.  He was not an Interahamwe.  

So what I'm saying, in short, the group of attackers that was killing people and vandalising property, and what have you, was not made up exclusively of MRND members or of Interahamwe. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, relying on your own experience of the 7th, 8th and 9th of April, do you feel that there was any force -- or did your forces have the capacity to resist this overflow, or these overwhelming circumstances?  As far as you know, what could have stopped the situation from degenerating? 
A.	Counsel, I'm not sure that I have understood your question.  Please kindly repeat.  I did not understand your question. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, maybe I will split the question into two.  For the first part, relying on your observations on the 7th, 8th and 9th of April, do you -- or did you have the capacity to stop or check this overwhelming violence, and the spread thereof, which you have so defined? 
A.	In my capacity as bourgmestre of the commune, I did not have the necessary human and material resources to check or stop those acts of violence.  That is why I had recourse to my hierarchy to request assistance by way of gendarmes or forces of law and order to assist in stopping the 
	acts of violence and massacres that were being committed in the commune.  

I have already explained why I was overwhelmed; namely, because members of the population were moving from neighbouring communes, dissatisfied persons who were violent and had deep hatred for the RPF; and those who were collaborating with the RPF were moving from one area to the other.  They had experienced misery and had gone through very difficult situations.  They had been driven from their lands and had become nomadic beggars.  

So these are people who had flooded our commune, I was not able to control them.  Maybe a 
higher force could have controlled them.  The forces I had with me were not able or did not have the capacity to stop those acts of violence within the commune.

At the same time there was a movement of other people who wanted to take advantage of the prevailing disorder and chaos to steal and do whatever pleased them.  In that situation the administration and public order were entirely perturbed.  It was an extremely difficult situation to control at that time, at least at my level. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, do you recall the military -- or do you remember what the military situation was at that time?  Was your commune affected or concerned by military movements at the time? 
A.	Let me tell you that from the 8th of April -- rather, from the 7th of April, the RPF had already launched hostilities.  The soldiers of the FAR who were at Gabiro camp had been dislodged and had gone to Murambi at the gateway of Rukara.  

On the 9th there was fighting between the RPF and the FAR.  Soldiers had deserted and had taken off with arms and weapons.  The population was moving here and there.  There was fighting in the surrounding neighbourhoods.  Riamanyoni secteur, which was close, was also a combat area and military operations were taking place in that area, and all of that made it difficult for me to restore order and security within the population. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, on the 10th of April 1994, what was the situation like in your commune? 
A.	The situation deteriorated from day to day.  And as I was telling you, the RPF continued to advance while the FAR continued to retreat.  So the masses -- and the population in view of the advance of the RPF was experiencing a situation that could not get better.  

On the 10th, the 11th and the 12th there was fighting in the area.  And on the 13th April the RPF took over Rukara commune.  I had to flee because, as others, I had no choice but to flee.  

So from the 12th, I had to take off from the commune since it had come under RPF control.  The question -- the answer, therefore, is that from the 7th of April to the time of my flight on the 
13th of April 1994, the situation did not get any better. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, maybe you want to clarify the circumstances in which you fled and tell us the conditions in which you were able to escape from that situation and find refuge somewhere.
A.	I thank you.

At that time -- in fact to be specific, from the 10th Rukara commune was already a combat zone.  And on the 13th the RPF had full control over the entire commune.  So I fled.  I went into exile, like all other members of the population in Rukara.  Everybody was afraid and frightened of the RPF.  There was general panic and wherever it was said that the RPF had arrived at a particular location, everybody fled, because we were aware of what the RPF was doing as it advanced into our area.  So I fled.  I left Rukara and went to an area known as Kayonza, K-A-Y-O-N-Z-A for Kayonza.  

On the 15th of April the RPF continued to pursue us.  Some RPF soldiers or elements would fire towards our camps at night and once again we were forced to flee.  

On the 16th I got to Kabarongo.  And once again fighting was ongoing and the RPF got to that area and so we had to flee once more under panic and in view of the obtaining violence.

So on the 17th we were in Kibungo, the capital of the province.  And we felt if there were FAR soldiers around we were well protected.  But on the 20th the RPF shelled Kibungo and the entire population.  As you can see from Byumba to Rukara, and what have you, there were these flocks -- or floods of people moving.  

So on the 20th we left Kibungo, hoping we would move to safer grounds and safer areas.  And that took us to Rusumo, which is very close to the Tanzania border, and we spent three days there.  But the RPF continued to chase us and track us down.  They met us there and killed a number of people.  They massacred some people.  And so there was general panic whenever the RPF came close to where we were.  And so we had to cross the border.  I crossed the border on the 28th of April 1994.   

The truth of the matter is that on the 29th of April 1994 the RPF captured the Rusumo bridge, which was the only passage by which the population could escape into Tanzania.  

Rusumo is spelt R-U-S-U-M-O.  That Rusumo bridge was captured by the RPF on the 29th, and they started firing into the air.  And those who had lagged behind jumped into the rivers and there was general carnage and massacres by the RPF.  

You see the FAR soldiers had moved towards Gitarama where the provisional government had set up office, as we learnt over the radio.  So the RPF continued to massacre the civilian population.  And I'm not the only one who has narrated this story.  I do recall that international newspapers carried articles about the massacres that had taken place in that area.  

Unfortunately, with this information campaign it was said that those people had been killed by the Interahamwe.  Well, I also read in a newspaper known as Africa International the testimony of one Marcel Guérin, a Belgian national, who provided a detailed narration of the massacres and 
acts of violence committed by the RPF in the area.  So I have testified as to what I saw, what I experienced myself in these matters.  

And I therefore, in answer to your question, say that I fled because of acts of violence, because of the insecurity and because I could no longer hold the fort and I had to save my own skin.  It is for those reasons that I fled towards Tanzania crossing the border on the 28th of April 1994. 
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Witness, for those clarifications.

You have referred to taking off or fleeing.  And in your testimony you said "we fled" or "we took off as the RPF continued to advance".  

Now, are you saying that from the 13th of April to the 29th of April you were fleeing the advance of the RPF?  And when you say "you" in the plural, who are you referring to?  Who does that plural "you" represent? 
A.	When I said "we", I'm referring to myself and part of the population that was afraid of the RPF.  I was not alone.  There was a significant number of people, thousands of people who were fleeing the deadly advance of the RPF. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, the deadly advance of the RPF which you referred to, was it against military forces at that time, around the 13th of April, or between 13th of April or the 29th April? 
A.	Well, I have stated that upon leaving Rukara, I felt that I was going to find security and be protected by government forces.  

When we got to Kayonza, almost all the Rwandan armed forces were directed towards Kigali.  When I went to -- when we got to Kibungo there was a military camp and once the RPF started shelling all the forces took off for Kigali.  And so we ended up among ourselves, civilians without any protection whatsoever.  

But in spite of all that, and given the fact that we were civilians, the RPF did not -- or in spite of the fact that we were civilians, the RPF did not stop attacking us.  They continued to advance and they continued to kill as we continued to flee.  

So what I'm saying is that from Kibungo the military had fled.  By the time we got to Rusumo, there was not a single FAR soldier with us.  It was entirely civilians, and these are the people who were the targets of acts of violence who were massacred and decimated by the RPF forces.  

I narrate this from my own personal experience and also from reading the newspaper, which I referred to previously. 
Q.	Witness, the victims that you left behind you, were they -- they were victims of who? 
A.	Let me add that they were RPF victims. 
Q.	Witness, during this period were there a lot of victims? 
A.	There were a lot of victims.  The road was strewn with dead bodies.  There were a lot of deaths.  It was a terrible situation.  We did not conduct any census to be able to say -- we did not take a body count to be able to say that there were X number of people killed.  But when you go to the banana plantations, and so on, you can say that a lot of people were killed.  And other observers and witnesses who were there made similar observations.  

In Tanzania there was HCR reports to the effect that there were dead bodies thrown into the Akagera.  So there were many victims, uncountable.  We did not take a body count. 
Q.	Witness, when you made reference to an article published in Africa International, do you recall what was being recounted in this article; and if so, can you tell the Court? 
A.	I read the article and I realised that what was recounted in the article is exactly what I saw myself.  It was exactly what I had seen.  Mr. Michel Guérin, the one who was -- who wrote the article, came to Gahini at a time that the population had been massacred -- massacred.  He recounted what happened at Rusumo.  And I had seen everything that he was recounting myself. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, can Issa assist me to hand one of the exhibits from the bundle of documents to the witness, more specifically one of the articles of Africa International. 
MR. SENDZE:
Excuse me.  If the witness is testifying that he witnessed everything that is reported in this article, why doesn't he give his testimony as to what he witnessed, instead of us going to read an article from somebody who is not in the box.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, to react to the point made by my colleague on the other side, I'd like to say that the witness has said a number of things.  And maybe we could confront him with -- he is saying that he saw the same thing as the author of this article.  And maybe from his account, we could ask him to confirm that the account of Mr. Guérin is what he's referring to. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, what you're proposing is not really permissible.  

And the -- if the article was contradictory to what the witness was saying, the Prosecutor could have used it during cross-examination.  But if you're wanting the witness simply to look at this article and agree what is said is true, that's just leading the witness -- that's just leading testimony, so that that process is not permissible. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, we have several examples in this trial, from the first day of the trial, where several documents were admitted on to the records after witness -- after witnesses made references to them.  Accounts that supported what they had testified to.  

What he's saying is -- what Mr. Guérin wrote supports what -- supports his accounts.  Several documents were admitted into the records in such circumstances.  Some were admitted solely for purposes of identification.  The witness did say that everything he's recounting has been -- have been recounted in detail by Mr. Guérin who was a special witness to the events.

These -- I think what Mr. Guérin has described is something that should not remain outside the 
records of the Chamber, since this will help the Chamber to determine the -- to shed light or illuminate the Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, there's another issue.  This is something written in 1998, so it's not a contemporaneous account.  We have ruled that the process that you've proposed is not permissible. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. Chairman -- Mr. President, I have no choice but to accept the decision of the Chamber.  The fact that I do not understand that -- because it is not contemporaneous, this cannot be admitted into -- on to the record.  

I'm aware that there were several examples where documents had been admitted.  And what 
Mr. Guérin is saying refers to events of 1994 and he was recounting in 1998 what happened in 1994 on the basis of his memory.  In fact, that is the title of his article, because the article was:  
Rwanda, Disturbing Testimony on What Happened in 1994.  It is not a testimony on what happened in 1998.  It is a testimony -- distressing testimony of what the RPF did in 1994.

Mr. President, I still want to request at least one thing of you.  To the extent that the witness has made reference to this document, at least I can show it to him so that he can admit that this is what he's referring to so that it can be admitted, be it only for purposes of identification at the very least. 
MR. SENDZE:
We don't understand what is happening here.  The Court has ruled that this document cannot be used in the manner proposed by counsel, so these further submissions are unnecessary. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We can permit the document to be marked for identification, and then you must move on. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the French booth would like you to repeat. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I said we can permit the document to be marked for identification, and then we must move on. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, may I then pass on this document to the witness so he can indicate that this indeed is the document he was referring to a while ago?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, we have already ruled that the document can be marked for identification, so it is unnecessary to hand it to Mr. Issa for him to attach an identifying number to it.  We had accepted that this is the document the witness has been referring to. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, may I then request the Chamber to allow me to request the witness for his comments on the article, once it's been admitted for identification purposes, for him to make his comments. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, we've already ruled on the matter.  You can ask the witness questions that are permissible.  Now, let's move on.

1015H 
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, you must have before you this document.  
A.	I do not have it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
He does not have the document before him, and we have directed that it should not be put before him.  

There's only one Bench in this courtroom, Mr. Weyl.  You have to take our instructions at this stage.  We have -- you have made an application, and we have made a ruling.  Now, let's move on.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I've never been in doubt -- in any doubt as to the fact that there is only one Bench in this case, and to respect its decisions.  And I practice in this courtroom with all the due deference to your Bench and on no occasion will I ever show any disrespect to the Bench.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, Mr. Marcel Guérin, in an article, makes reference to the crimes committed by the RPF.  Is it the same description as those -- 
MR. SENDZE: 
We object.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I understand that each time reference is made to RPF crimes, the Prosecutor is on his feet.  We have testimony of the witness on the RPF crimes, and we will proceed.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, maybe to -- to examine some issues that has not -- that have not yet been mentioned in your testimony:  Prior to the events of the 6th April 1994, as you described them, was there a system of self-defence established in your commune?  
A.	Self-protection?  What exactly -- what do you mean by self-protection?  If you can explain that a bit, because I don't quite get your question.  
Q.	Now, to explain my question.  Were -- were the local residents trained, organised to protect themselves against possible attacks of criminals or possible attacks of the RPF?  Were the people organised to protect themselves?  
A.	No, Counsel.  The population was to be protected by the administration.  The commune, more specifically the bourgmestre, was to ensure the protection of persons and property, together with the communal policemen.  This was the situation in times of peace.  

In war times, as I told you that the Rukara commune was neighbouring to the Akagera national park where there were fighting -- where there was fighting between the RPF and the Rwandan armed forces, and as I have told you that there were infiltrations of RPF troops disturbing the public peace, I had to revert to the military authorities to station a gendarmerie detachment at Rukara.  And it was -- it was those gendarmes, in collaboration with the police -- with the communal policemen, who were protecting and ensuring the safeguard of the -- the safety of the Rukara population.  

So the local population were never told to organise their own protection.  That, rather, will expose them to danger.  And that is why I relied on people who are entrusted with security duties.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, did you get to know about the establishment of a civil defence programme in your commune?  
A.	A civil defence programme never existed in Rukara.  I have told you that we were dealing with infiltrators from the RPF.  These were soldiers.  Civilians were not going to be trained to fight people who were special -- war -- specialists in war.  So that did not take place.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, do you know if a civil defence programme was set up in the Kibungo préfecture?  
A.	I told you that the Kibungo préfecture did not have the civil defence programme.  The entire Kibungo préfecture had been run over by the RPF in the course of the month of April.  For the entire month of April, Kibungo was in the hands of the RPF.  And the bulk of the population had left the place; they were in camps in Tanzania.  So this defence -- civil defence programme, it was not established.  
Q.	Witness, do you know one Colonel Rwagafilita?  R-W-A-G-A-F-I-L-I-T-A.  
A.	Rwagafilita was a soldier, native of Kibungo, in the Kigarama commune.  He was recruited, I believe, in -- around 1992.  I know him, but what I know of him is that he's a retired soldier who was chief of the national gendarmerie.  That is all.  I don't know any more about him than that.  
Q.	Witness, if we are to believe the indictment, Colonel Rwagafilita was allegedly in charge of the civil defence programme in your préfecture.  Now, on account of your previous testimony, can you comment on this statement?  
A.	I explained here that the entire Kibungo préfecture was under RPF control towards the end of April 1994.  If the civil defence system had been set up prior to that period, I would have known because I was a bourgmestre of one of the communes of Kibungo.  So if that civil defence programme had been established prior to April, I told you that the bulk of the population of Kibungo were in refugee camps in Tanzania.  

So, to say that Rwagafilita was in charge of civil defence programme in Kibungo, I wouldn't know which period they are referring to.  Because prior to the month of April, I would have known.  After April, the bulk of the Kibungo population was in Tanzania.  So the existence of a civil defence programme led by Rwagafilita is something I'm not aware of.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, in your préfecture, did you get to know about the establishment of a préfecture security council?  
A.	The préfecture security council had been in existence for a long time.  It was chaired by the préfet of the préfecture, who was the chairperson, and it was made up of the leader of the armed forces -- the local leader of the armed forces, leader of the office of the prosecutor, the president of the first instance court, and the intelligence service.  It was an institution which was well known, even prior to the war, and which continued up to April 1994.  
Q.	Did you have any opportunity to attend the préfecture security council in the Kibungo préfecture?  
A.	Yes, when the préfet so wished, he could call -- he could invite the bourgmestres to attend such a préfecture security council.  So I was able to attend the préfecture security council meeting to which bourgmestres had been invited.  
Q.	To the best of your recollection, Witness, are you able to tell the Court around what period you attended such a meeting?  
A.	I'm not able to give a specific date, but I recall that I attended the préfecture security council meeting on a day when the agenda was the multiparty system, and the préfet was asking we, the bourgmestres, whether political parties in Kibungo should not interact to carry out their membership drive.  We told the préfet that the local population should be allowed to select the political party of their choice, and no one should be forced to be a member of a political party that the bourgmestre or an administrative authority was a member of.  

I recall that the meeting I attended focused on this issue, how to manage the multiparty system.  The political parties were, at the same time, leaving the local population free to select the party that they wanted to be members of.  
Q.	Witness, at one of those meetings that you attended, did you have the -- did you hear any ethnic statements?  
A.	On no account did I hear any such statements in the Kibungo préfecture.  That never happened.  Particularly since the Kibungo security council was chaired by the préfet, and the préfet was a member of the PSD.  He is a native of Kibungo, and Kibungo never had problems -- or, did not have ethnic tension or ethnic problems.  We, rather, said that we should make sure that the ethnic problems did not come in because in Kibungo the harmonious mix of the ethnic groups had been achieved, and the war had brought -- or, when the war started, the administrative authorities wanted to ensure that the ethnic tendencies should not be introduced into the Kibungo préfecture.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, are you able to say, in your capacity as a bourgmestre, that you participated in the operations of the MRND or any other political party?  
A.	As a bourgmestre, and as a citizen -- a Rwandan citizen, I was entitled to be a member of a political party.  I made my choice and I selected the MRND.  I was a bourgmestre; I was a member of the MRND.  I was a member of MRND and, besides, I was a member of the MRND préfecture committee.  I carried out my bourgmestre functions, be it in my commune.  In my commune I never put pressure on anyone for him to join my party.  

First of all, in Rukara, all the parties were represented.  And let me tell you that the chairman of PL, Justin Mugenzi, was a native of Gahini in the Rukara commune.  So he is entitled to carry out a membership drive among the local population.  I can tell you that there was one Ngango, Félicien, a native of Rukara who was vice-chairman of the executive committee of the PSD.  So, as a native of Rukara, native of Kibungo, it was his right to have members of his party.  

So, in short, all parties were represented in the Rukara commune, and everyone was free to choose his party.  At no time do -- did I put any pressure on anyone to become a member of this or that party.  
Q.	Witness, in the exercise of your functions of bourgmestre, did you ever receive instructions, orders, directives from leaders of your party, the MRND?  
A.	To my knowledge, since I never put pressure on the local residents, similarly I did not receive any instruction, any order, any pressure from any leader of the MRND.  So the parties -- all the parties, not just the MRND, all the other parties present in the Rukara commune and Kibungo did not put pressure on the administrative authorities -- did not put any pressure on the administrative authorities.  Anyway, they were all members of their own political parties, and we exercised our administrative functions.  

Generally, the bourgmestre thought that the members of a political party should not put any pressure on the local population.  So I -- there was never any pressure on me, and I never put any pressure on the local population.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, just one last question before the break, maybe.  Now, Witness, in your capacity as bourgmestre, did you ever take any initiatives or measures regarding your subjects relying on ethnic considerations? 
A.	Sincerely speaking, I never did any such thing.  I never brought any pressure to bear, nor did I ever feel any sense of ethnic-based considerations.  I have told you already that in Rukara commune we did not have any ethnic-based problems before the war.  And during the war we tried not to elicit any ethnic tendencies in the population.  I have always stood against division and ethnic-based contradictions in our country.  
MR. WEYL:
Now, Mr. President, I am in your hands.  This must be a good time for the break.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  How much longer do you think you're going to be after the recess?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, as I look at the remaining questions, I believe that I would need another 30 minutes or so after the break.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you.  
MR. SENDZE:
Just on that, I've been looking at the disclosure that was made to us on the anticipated testimony of the witness, and I believe everything has been covered.  So, please, if there is any new issue that will be discussed by the Defence, would they kindly inform us.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Well, we will take the recess and that can be dealt with during that period, if necessary.  
(Court recessed from 1037H to 1104H) 
MR. WEYL:
Monsieur le Président, je vous remercie. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Monsieur témoin, were there rallies organised in your commune, rallies organised by political parties?  
A.	Following the advent of the multiparty system in Rwanda, several political parties held rallies in the Rukara commune.  MRND held rallies, PL held rallies, PSD held rallies, MDR had its own rallies; all these political parties were engaging in a membership drive.  So, yes, indeed, rallies were held in Rukara commune.  
Q.	Witness, as a bourgmestre of the Rukara commune, did you attend those rallies?  
A.	I attended virtually all the rallies held by the various political parties because I had to be there to ensure the security of the population, ensure that nothing happened that could disturb public order.  Because among -- it is one of the duties of the bourgmestre to ensure the security of all those persons.  I will attend whenever I had the time.  If I were not free, I was represented by an official of the commune. 
Q.	Witness, in those rallies that were held in your commune, was there any violent events, violent incidents?  
A.	To my knowledge, during the rallies organised by the political parties, there was never any crisis, tension, or threats.  So they would come, organise their rally, and leave without any incident.  
Q.	Witness, did you get to know of what was referred to as the Kubohoza practice?  
A.	That practice never took place in the Rukara commune.  Quite honestly, that never happened.  If, when -- well, what I know about Kubohoza is that -- the practice of members of the opposition parties forcing members of the MRND to join -- to join their parties.  But since the MRND was the majority party in Rukara commune, this practice didn't take place.  
Q.	Witness, did you know Mathieu Ngirumpatse?  
A.	I know Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  I know him, as I said in my testimony, from 1994 to 1999 -- from 1984 to 1989 I was in charge of the official gazette in the presidency of the republic.  During that period, Mathieu Ngirumpatse had been appointed as an adviser in the president's office in charge of external relations.  I knew him as somebody who worked in the president's office.  We used to meet often, on Saturdays doing community work, so I know him.  I got to know Mathieu.  
There was a time he was minister of justice; I knew him then.  I knew him as an artist, a musician.  He was the choir leader of the -- a choir group referred to as the chorale de Kigali.  I used to go to church; I see him sing hymns.  I knew Mathieu as a member of the party.  And in 1992 he was appointed as secretary of the MRND.  Since I attended MRND congresses, I used to meet him and we would greet each other.  After that he was appointed the national chairman of the MRND.  I used to meet him in rallies.  

I also knew Mathieu when he was my co-detainee at the UNDF.  

So I knew him, and he is somebody I really appreciate, somebody who is very tolerant at all levels.  So I know Mathieu.  I know him and I appreciate him -- I admire him.  
Q.	Witness, you say that you have seen Mathieu during rallies that he may have attended or may have addressed.  Did Mathieu attend rallies that were organised in your commune?  
A.	In the Rukara commune, I recall clearly that the MRND organised a rally in the commune.  The chairman of the MRND in the Rukara commune invited Mathieu as a special invitee.  So he came as a special invitee to the rally in the Rukara commune.  
Q.	Did he make any address during that rally?  
A.	Mathieu came; he was introduced to the MRND members.  He took the floor, explained extensively the motto of MRND, which was "peace, unity, and development".  He urged residents of Rukara to join the MRND and to share with them the ideals of the MRND.  What he did in his address was to point out the good deeds of the MRND, to talk about the ideals of the MRND.  That is what -- that is why he took the floor and that is the statement he made.  
Q.	Witness, at that time or at any other time was the MRND formed on an ethnic basis or on the basis of ethnic discrimination?  
A.	To my knowledge as a member of the MRND, the MRND was -- never had -- never operated on an ethnic basis, particularly since its motto -- one of the components of its motto is peace among the various components of the Rwandan society.  So it never preached anything along the lines of ethnic division.  
Q.	Within the MRND, during the multiparty system era and from -- and during the war and the invasion of Rwanda by the RPF troops, was the MRND recruiting specifically -- was the MRND recruiting solely on the basis of ethnicity, or was the MRND recruiting from all the ethnic groups?  
A.	We have to be specific, because before the multiparty system and the invasion of the RPF, all Rwandans were MRND.  All Rwandans were automatically members of the MRND.  So I would like to have some clarification so I can answer that question.  
Q.	From the law establishing the multiparty system, did you have the impression or did you observe that MRND recruited members from only one ethnic group, or was the MRND made up of members, people from all ethnic groups? 
A.	Since the MRND was preaching peace in Rwanda, it recruited from -- it recruited Rwandans from all ethnic groups, regardless of their ethnicity.  I know members of the MRND who were members of the bodies, various bodies of the MRND.  So there was no recruitment solely on the basis of one ethnic group.  
Q.	Witness, when Mathieu Ngirumpatse came to your commune as a special invitee to an MRND rally, did he make any -- any statement inciting to -- inciting ethnic hatred?  
A.	As I said, Mathieu never made a statement or conducted himself in any manner that would indicate that he was preaching ethnic division.  I clearly stated that he focused on the motto of the MRND, the ideals of the MRND, the programme of the MRND.  And in that there was no word, no statement that indicated any ethnic -- ethnic hatred. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Were there other rallies of the MRND in the Kibungo préfecture which you attended?  
A.	Yes, I attended several MRND meetings at the préfecture level, and in which Mathieu Ngirumpatse also participated.  There were some rallies that he attended, and some organised at the préfecture level that he did -- he did not attend.  But I want to focus more specifically in on -- or, in MRND meetings attended by Mathieu.  

The first one, if my memory serves me right, was organised in 1992 after the advent of the multiparty system.  Mathieu attended that meeting; he took the floor.  He spoke to the people of Kibungo.  His message has always been the same:  He preached peace, unity, and the development of the Rwandan people.  He urged the people of Kibungo to join the MRND massively.  

The second rally that Mathieu attended was held in 1993 following the signing of the Arusha Accords.  He came to Kibungo.  His message has always been the same:  He stated that the MRND supports the Arusha Accords 100 per cent, and he explained to Kibungo -- MRND members of Kibungo that the MRND was going to implement the Arusha Peace Accords.  He explained what was MRND's share in the ministerial portfolio as per the Arusha Peace Accords, what were MRND positions in the national assembly, and he further said that the MRND should scrupulously respect the provisions of the Arusha Peace Accords, and that members of the MRND should be prepared to participate in the elections that would follow the transitional period.  And also that MRND should win those elections.  

Those were the three (sic) meetings in which I observed the presence of Mathieu Ngirumpatse in the commune and in the Kibungo préfecture.  
Q.	Did you hear of any incidents following the Kibungo rally?  
A.	If my memory serves me right, I think there was an incident following the MRND rally of 1993.  After the rally, those who came from Kigali to attend that meeting, on their way back to Kigali they got to a place called Kabarondo.  At Kabarondo there was a parish and a communal office of the Kabarondo commune.  When those from Kigali who were going back, they met a youth group of PL and MDR, and they started throwing stones at the people going back to Kigali.  So they stopped and chased those throwing stones.  And these people dispersed into the forests and banana plantations.  So those that -- who were being attacked came back.  And since I was among them, they continued on their way to Kigali.  I stopped at Kayonza because that is where I had to turn off to Rukara.  

So that incident was reported on Radio Muhabura, where it was said that when the MRND Interahamwe got to -- that they were attacking -- the MRND Interahamwe were attacking people; whereas they were the ones being attacked by the youth groups of PL.  And that is how it was reported by Radio Muhabura.  That is how they always reported events.  
Q.	Witness, do you know of an MRND rally that was held at Rwamagana -- R-W-A-M-A-G-A-N-A -- between 1992 and 1993?  
A.	Yes, an MRND meeting was held at Rwamagana.  I was organised -- I was invited to that meeting and it was organised at the communal level, Rutonde commune.  And since the Rutonde commune was in Rwamagana, that was where the MRND rally was held at the communal level.  But let me add that in that MRND rally, to my knowledge Mathieu Ngirumpatse was not present.  
Q.	To your knowledge, were there other national leaders of the MRND present at that rally?  
A.	No, it was a rally held at the communal level, and they invited members of the préfecture -- préfecture council.  I did not see any member of the national leadership.  Maybe they were busy elsewhere.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, in your commune, was there a structured organisation of the Interahamwe za MRND?  
A.	I have said this, and I repeat, that there were no Interahamwe in the Rukara commune.  And I did say that there was a group that used to perform folkloric songs when the MRND organised rallies in the commune.  This ballet -- ballet group of MRND in Rukara referred to themselves as Interahamwe.  But it was not a structured group; it was a name that was borrowed from what they heard from Kigali.  But it was not a structured group that was referred to as the MR -- as the Interahamwe.  
Q.	Witness, to your knowledge, was there a structured organisation of Interahamwe za MRND in the Kibungo préfecture?  
A.	I have told you that I was a member of the préfectoral committee of the MRND in Kibungo.  The Interahamwe, as a structured and organised group, never existed in Kibungo.  Whenever there was an MRND préfectoral meeting at that level, various communes provided performance groups which sang and displayed -- and entertained at the rallies.  But there was no such well-organised structure, neither in Rukara commune, nor in Kibungo préfecture.  Otherwise, in my capacity as bourgmestre, I would have been aware of the existence of such an organised group.  
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Witness.  Witness, do you know Sylvain Mutaburuka?  M-U-T-A-B-U-R-U-K-A.  
A.	Mutaburuka, Sylvain, yes, I know him at several counts, or on several levels.  He was a native of Sake commune.  We both attended secondary school together in a minor seminary at Zaza.  I knew him when we were still very young.  

Then, when I became a state civil servant in Kigali, he used to work at the Caisse sociale du Rwanda, so I knew him also at that level.  He was the bourgmestre of the commune, of Sake commune, while I was bourgmestre of Rukara commune, and I also knew him in that capacity.  

Further on, I knew him as a member of parliament at the CND.  So I -- in broad strokes, I can say that I know Mutaburuka, Sylvain.  
Q.	Witness, Prosecution witnesses here have alleged that Mutaburuka, Sylvain, was the chairman of the Interahamwe za MRND at the Kibungo préfectoral level.  What is your comment, Witness?  
A.	Quite sincerely, anyone who claims that Mutaburuka was president of the MRND Interahamwe in Kibungo would be lying.  It is an untruth to make such an assertion.  I knew Mutaburuka so well that if he had been elected to such a position I would have been aware of it.  It therefore appears to me that such allegations are baseless fabrications regarding Mutaburuka.  He is someone who I have known for a long time, and if he had held any such position I necessarily would have been aware of it.  My conclusion, therefore, is that no such thing ever existed.  
Q.	Witness, you were a member of the préfectoral committee bureau at the Kibungo préfecture level, and in that capacity you attended the préfectoral committee meetings; is that so?  
A.	Yes.  When the préfectoral bureau of the MRND had its meetings, I would have been invited and I would attend in my capacity as member.  But we did not have many meetings.  Whenever those meetings took place, I would have attended in that capacity.  
Q.	Witness, a Prosecution witness has alleged here that Mathieu Ngirumpatse attended MRND meetings at the préfectoral level, and that at one of such préfectoral committee meetings in Kibungo he allegedly introduced the local officials of the Interahamwe to the meeting.  As far as you know, and as far as you are familiar with the Kibungo préfectoral committee meetings, what would be your reaction to such an allegation?  
A.	My comment would be that this never happened.  Mathieu never sat at or participated in any meeting of the MRND préfectoral committee.  The two times on which I saw him was at some rallies.  But reference to his having introduced members of the Interahamwe at an MRND préfectoral meeting in Kibungo, as I have told you already, there was no group -- no structured organisation known as the Interahamwe in the commune or at the Kibungo préfectoral level.  I can reassert that such a thing never happened, never existed.  
Q.	Now, to be more specific, Witness, and in order to clearly understand you, did it ever happen, on any occasion whatsoever, that, as far as you know, Mathieu Ngirumpatse introduced the local leaders of the Interahamwe to any group within the jurisdiction of the Kibungo préfecture?  
A.	Such a thing never happened.  Such a thing was never done.  Mathieu never introduced any local leaders of the Interahamwe anywhere in Kibungo préfecture.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Thank you, Witness.  

Now, Witness, based on your observations and what you heard, and going by your knowledge of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, would you think that it is possible for Mathieu Ngirumpatse to have been involved in the planning and preparation of a genocide of the Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994, and even prior to that time?  
A.	Such an assertion I would say, if made by anyone, would be baseless.  It is a gratuitous assertion.  I say so because, as far as I know, and mindful of any level whatsoever, there has never been a meeting with the agenda to plan and organise the genocide of the Tutsi, whether it be at the political level, at the communal level, or at the préfectoral level.  Such a meeting or such planning never took place, because I attended almost all the meetings.  And if any such thing had happened, I would necessarily have been aware of it.  Such a thing never existed.  I have already testified that Hutus and Tutsis lived in harmony.  And I say so because I was duly informed and duly knowledgeable about these matters within our préfecture.  So I can assert that such a thing never existed.  

Let me tell you sincerely that I have two sisters who are married to Tutsis.  We did not have that problem.  All their children, their godfathers and godmothers are Tutsis.  So I do not understand how such a meeting could have been organised in my presence, and that I would have entertained or accepted such a programme or such planning to kill -- such planning of genocide -- or, a genocide of the Tutsis.  It would appear to me that those who make such allegations are not aware of the reality of what transpired in our country.  Such a thing never, and I repeat, never, happened.  It never happened that people got together to organise to commit a genocide of the Tutsi.  Thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Witness -- Witness, what then would you say about Mathieu Ngirumpatse, mindful of your knowledge, mindful of what you saw, mindful of what you observed?  Would you say that Mathieu Ngirumpatse would have participated in a joint criminal enterprise with a view to eliminate Tutsis?  
A.	I will repeat my own very words:  Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and once again I state clearly that be it in Kibungo or in Rukara, or in respect of any other meetings which I attended, I never heard mention of any such planning from Mr. Mathieu's mouth.  I never heard him mention anything relating to the planning of the genocide of the Tutsi.  That never took place; that never existed.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, Your Honours, I have now come to the end of my examination-in-chief, and I thank you for your kind attention.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. -- Mr. Weyl.  
Mr. Sow, do you have any questions for this witness?  
MR. SOW:
I have no questions, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Witness, you now have to be cross-examined by the Prosecutor, and you will have to respond to his questions.  I invite Mr. Sendze to commence his examination of you.  
MR. SENDZE: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Before I start my cross-examination, can I please request that the ID document that was discussed by Mr. Weyl -- was not given a number.  If that could be done now.  
MR. MJUI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  The document is marked as ID. NG6.  Thank you.
(Exhibit ID. NG6, marked for identification)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Mpambara.  
A.	Good morning, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	You discussed in your examination-in-chief a number of attacks on certain families in Rukara.  Can you confirm that those families that were attacked were Tutsi families?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, attacks by whom?  
Q.	The attacks you claim were carried out by bandits in your commune.  
A.	Attacks in Rukara?  The attacks in Rukara were targeted at Tutsi families.  
Q.	These attacks were not perpetrated by the RPF; were they?  
A.	Yes, they were not carried out by the RPF in the night of the 7th to the 8th of April 1994. 
Q.	They were also not perpetrated by the infiltrators from the RPF; correct?  
A.	I have already told you that the attacks that took place at that time were carried out by delinquents, indisciplined persons, rascals, and I didn't testify that the attacks were carried out by the RPF or infiltrators.  I clearly identified those who carried out those attacks.  
Q.	You talked about the Interahamwe.  Would it be true that, though it was not formally organised, there existed an entity in Rukara described as the Interahamwe?  
A.	It was my testimony indeed that in Rukara there was no structured organisation known as the Interahamwe.  Then I went on to explain that there was a group of entertainers which performed whenever the MRND held rallies in Rukara, and that this group took on the name of the Interahamwe, copying that name from what they heard was being referred to as the Interahamwe in Kigali.  The difference being that it was not a structured group similar to the one which is generally referred to as the Interahamwe.  
(Pages 17 to 28 by Kirstin McLean)



































1145H 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Yes.  So there was a group of Interahamwe in Rukara, but they were not as structured as the group in Kigali.  This group performed only at MRND rallies; correct? 
A.	I said that it was an entertainment group.  And each word I use has its relevance.  It was an -- a performance group that would sing folkloric songs and perform traditional dances at rallies of the MRND party.  

In that context, therefore, that performance group of young persons and persons of all other categories and all other ethnic groups -- allow me to say that that group was also made up of Tutsis.  And so if you were to insinuate that they would be referred to as the Interahamwe, then I would tell you that such a group as such never existed, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	I'm not insinuating, Mr. Mpambara.  The question I asked was whether this group performed exclusively at MRND rallies.  You could say yes, or you could say no.  
A.	That group performed at MRND rallies. 
Q.	And you knew that this group was referred to -- or referred to itself as the Interahamwe; correct? 
A.	It was a simple name.  And let me explain further.  There were -- 
Q.	My question was whether you knew that the group referred to itself as the Interahamwe.  
A.	That group at that time was -- or had that name, Interahamwe, just like the name that they heard being used in Kigali, that name being Interahamwe.  But the structure, the organisation was simply a folkloric group.  And it ended there. 
Q.	Mr. Mpambara, leave the structure alone.  I just asked if you knew that the group called itself the Interahamwe, if you knew.  If you didn't know, say you didn't know.  
A.	The name Interahamwe -- well, there were even co-operatives that bore that name.  It's a name that is used in Rwanda -- in Rwanda.  

There were co-operative societies called Interahamwe.  So when you say Interahamwe -- many, many groups of farmers also used that name, Interahamwe.  It was a Rwandan name which meant people working together.  And that's what I've been telling you.  

Many young people, young farmers also used the name Interahamwe.  There were people involved in brake -- or block manufacturing who called themselves the Interahamwe.  So it was a -- it was an ordinary Rwandan term that different groups used. 
Q.	You testified that you were not able to identify the bandits who killed the Tutsi families in Rukara; is that correct? 
A.	I was not able to identify them to the extent that they operated, should I say, clandestinely, or in hiding.  Whenever I went to any location, they would go into hiding.  And when I went to see those who had been attacked, they told me that they had heard that there were acts of violence being committed and that they had escaped to seek refuge in various churches.  

So I continued to investigate and to try to determine the identity of those people.  But as things evolved and because of the chaos and because of the hostility in place and because of the thrust -- or in the massive movements of the population, I was not able to identify those people.  Also Rwanda -- Rukara fell, rather, quite briefly into the hands of the RPF. 
Q.	Mr. Mpambara, you've already given evidence in-chief.  This is cross-examination.  You don't need to repeat what you stated in great detail.  All you would have said was that you were not able to identify the bandits.  And that would have been okay.  So please listen to the question and answer concisely, please.  
A.	I must explain the circumstances in which I was unable to identify those people. 
Q.	Given that you were unable to identify these bandits, isn't it possible that the members of that dance group that called itself the Interahamwe were also involved in attacking the Tutsi families in Rukara? 
A.	I stated clearly that although -- in fact, I continued my investigations.  I did not stop at that level.  When I got to the refugee camps in Tanzania, I investigated further and found out that those who had attacked the Tutsis were not part of those whom you referred to as the Interahamwe, because their leaders, as I have told you, following my investigations, were one Ruvugo, Thaddée, who was the chairman of the MDR, a teacher at Gahini.  

Then there was his deputy, Mutsinzi, who was of the PSD, and he was a Mukombozi.  He was not an Interahamwe.  

So when you say that those who attacked were Interhamwes or members of the MRND -- well, I cannot confirm that. 
Q.	So you can confirm that the attacks were carried out by members of the PSD and the other opposition parties.  
A.	No.  What I said was that those who did all of that -- now, let me give you just a few examples.  But I do not rule out -- well, I said that this group of young delinquents was made up of people from all political parties. 
Q.	Including the MRND? 
A.	All political parties put together, taken together. 
Q.	You also talked about infiltrators in your evidence in-chief.  Were you yourself able to identify anyone as an infiltrator in Rukara? 
A.	Yes.  I identified them, and I -- and I knew them.  I can give you names, the names of people who left the area to join the RPF and after training returned to the area and lived among the people.  So what I am telling you is that there were infiltrators who came through the Akagera national park to disturb the peace and security of the people. 
Q.	Do you know a person by the name of Godefroid Ruzindana?  Godefroid is G-O-D-F-R-O-I-D-E (sic).  
A.	Yes.  I know him very well.  Ruzindana was a native of Kabarondo commune.  We studied together in Butare at the national pedagogic institute.  I know him.  He was the general director at the 
	ministry of national education.  He was appointed préfet of Kibungo préfecture.  And I know him at all levels. 
Q.	When did he stop being the préfet of Kibungo? 
A.	As far as I know and if memory does not fail me, he stopped being préfet of Kibungo around the 
	17th or 18th of April.  And I heard over radio that he was no longer préfet of Kibungo.  He was replaced by one Rudakabana, Anaclet.
Q.	So Ruzindana was removed from his position as préfet around the 17th of April 1994, and he was replaced by Anaclet Rudakubana.  That is A-N-C-A -- sorry -- A-N-A-C-L-E-T, R-U-D-A-K-U-B-A-N-A.  Correct? 
A.	Yes.  That is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Prosecutor, could you also spell the name of the préfet who was removed.  
MR. SENDZE:
Okay.  I had spelt his first name.  Ruzi -- Ruzindana is R-U-Z-I-N-D-A-N-A.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Isn't it true that Rudakubana was installed as préfet of Kibungo on the 19th of April 1994? 
A.	I cannot give you an exact date, but it was around the 18th or the 19th of April 1994. 
Q.	Do you know who presided over the installation ceremony? 
A.	I did not attend that ceremony, because I was fleeing.  We were not invited to the swearing-in, and I didn't attend that ceremony.  
Q.	But you testified in chief that by the 13th of April 1994 the RPF had overtaken Kibungo.  So I'm wondering how the government was able to install a new préfet on the 19th or 18th of April if the RPF had actually taken over Kibungo at that time.  
A.	I clearly recall that Rukara was captured on the 13th.  We got to Kibungo around the 17th or the 18th.  And that is the time when the RPF was shelling Kibungo.  Now, Kibungo had not yet been captured.  And if government appointed a new préfet, I don't know whether it was aware that the RPF was already shelling at Kibungo.  I was not a member of government, and I did not make any decisions on behalf of government. 
Q.	Yesterday you mentioned a certain Major Havugiyaremye.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	How well did you -- how well did you know this gentleman? 
A.	Havugiyaremye is someone I knew to be the commander of the Rwamagana gendarmerie.  That is the only level at which I knew him. 
Q.	And on certain occasions you had the opportunity to have a conversation with him; correct? 
A.	Yes.  As part of our duties, I will discuss security issues with him, security issues concerning my commune with him.  So I had to deal with him on security issues.  And that was as part of our duties, he in his capacity as commander of the gendarmerie and I as a bourgmestre. 
Q.	Were you aware of the training of Interahamwe youth in Mutara in 1993? 
A.	I never got to know that.  And I don't know it. 
Q.	Major Havugiyaremye did not discuss this matter with you? 
A.	No.  He never told me about this training. 
Q.	But he's somebody who would be in a position to know if such training took place in Mutara.  Do you agree? 
A.	But since he did not tell me anything, I wouldn't know if those training sessions took place.  But in any case, I was not interested in those training sessions.  And as far as I am concerned, we never discussed that issue. 
Q.	You know Ndindiliyimana, Augustin as well, don't you? 
MR. WEYL: 
Monsieur le Président -- 
THE WITNESS:
I got to know Ndindiliyimana, Augustin when I was detained at the UNDF.  That's when I got to know him. 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Now, we have information in this trial in the form of Prosecution Exhibit P. 512 in which General Ndindiliyimana reports that Major Havugiyaremye informed him about the training of Interahamwe in Mutara in 1993.  Do you have any reason to cast doubt on this information? 
A.	These were discussions between Ndindiliyimana and Havugiyaremye.  They did not concern me. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Mpambara, for responding to my questions.  
MR. SENDZE:
Mr. President, I have nothing further. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Is there any further -- redirect, Mr. Weyl?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I have three questions, except possibly for follow-up questions that might flow from the witness's answers.
RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, in your capacity as the bourgmestre of Rukara, which is close to the Akagera park, did you get to know of military training sessions for the youth wing of the MRND? 
A.	That never took place. 
MR. SENDZE:
That is not flowing from cross-examination. 
MR. WEYL: 
Very well.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl -- 
MR. WEYL: 
Very well.  And I accept that. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, I will oblige you. 
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  In -- it's pleasant to see that there is a smile on all faces in the -- in this courtroom and the fact that I'm part -- I'm responsible for that. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, coming back to you, the shelling of RPF, the killings on 25th - 24th -- 25th October -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry.  We didn't hear the date.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Did that -- 
A.	Counsel, please repeat your question.  I was a bit distracted. 
Q.	Let me rephrase my question.  Among the victims of shellings carried out by the RPF, among the victims of the killings of the RPF on the 13th April to 29th April 1994, in the regions that you went through when you were fleeing -- among those victims, were there only Hutus, or were there also Tutsis? 
MR. SENDZE:
Same objection. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, this is not grounded, because it flows from the Prosecutor's cross-examination when he attempted to identify the victims as being only Hutus and that they -- Tutsi victims were victims of acts carried out by Hutus.  And I want to know, if among the victims of shelling and killings, if there may have been Tutsis. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Witness, you can answer that question. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  I confirm that among the civilian population who suffered RPF atrocities -- this was a civilian population including all ethnic groups.  When we were fleeing, there were Tutsis with me.  So I will be lying if I say that the RPF killed only -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness does not complete his sentence, but it (sic) says that they were firing onto everybody, any moving object. 
THE WITNESS:
So Hutus as well as Tutsis died from RPF bullets. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I have a last question.  You did say that among the bandits, thieves -- the bandits and the thieves who carried out the attacks in Rukara on the 7th, 8th, 9th April, you got to know subsequently that they were members of all parties.  To your knowledge, were there others who were not members of any party, who did not belong to any party? 
A.	I was saying that these delinquents, thieves, from what I got to know, they were people who were not members of any known political parties.  There were even some who did not know about these political -- who did not know about these political parties.  So people who were members of all political parties probably had two, three membership parties.  

The political -- multiparty system came to Rwanda at a time that Rwandans did not know what 
were -- what political parties were.  So there were even members who were -- there were people who were not members of any political party who were engaged in these activities. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I've exhausted my three questions.  

	Witness, I thank you for your answers, and I thank you for your testimony, and I thank you for participating in the quest for the truth in this trial.  

Mr. President, I have no further questions in redirect.  As the Chamber knows, I would just like to make the usual request, that is, to request the Chamber to ask -- order the Chamber (sic) to arrange for the witness to meet Mr. Ngirumpatse, if witness intends to do so.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Weyl. 

Mr. Witness, this concludes your testimony before the trial -- before our Trial Chamber.  And we thank you, as we do all witnesses, for assisting us in our work.  But you are now excused and free to go.  The registrar will make arrangements to facilitate the request made by counsel. 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, on this occasion I would like to ask you for a favour, that is, if I can greet Mr. Ngirumpatse and also on that occasion if I can visit some of the detainees, two or three of them.  It's a favour I'm requesting of your Court. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yeah.  Mr. Witness, we have already made an order for the registrar to facilitate your meeting Mr. Ngirumpatse.  With regard to the other detainees, your application would have to be processed by the registrar, who is responsible for their detention.  The WVSS, who is taking care of you, may assist you in making that request to the registrar.  But -- but he is the authority that will decide upon that request. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
(Witness excused) 
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What language do you intend to use during your testimony?  
THE WITNESS:
French.  But I can speak French -- I can speak English, if necessary.  So I said that I prefer to speak French, but if there are questions that will re -- questions that will require me to speak English, I could do so. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, it's important that you select a language because the -- your evidence is being interpreted and the channel that you are speaking to will be just for the interpreters of one language.  I think it's currently attached to the French interpreters.  So your testimony will be going to the French interpreters' booth, who will then be translating it into the other languages of our trial.  

Before you came into court, we -- we had made an order for your protection for security reasons, but we have observed the affidavit you have signed requesting that that protective order be rescinded.  Do you confirm that is your wish?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  There's a document I signed when I was coming.  I don't know which document you are referring to.  If it is that document I signed, then I agree with what you are saying. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yeah.  I'm trying to find out whether you confirm that you wish to testi -- wish us to rescind the order we made for your protection and testify as an unprotected witness. 
THE WITNESS:
I'm ready to testify as an unprotected witness.  But when you are referring to a document, I'm saying that, if it is the document I signed when I got here, then I agree with you.  But for now I don't know the document you are referring to.  But my position is that I wish to testify as an unprotected witness.  

So I think there is a misunderstanding with regard to a document.  I simply do not know which document it is.  But my position is that I wish to testify as an unprotected witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We became aware of that wish because on the 11th of September you signed a document in the presence of the officers of the witness section which indicated that you are waiving your -- the protection the Court had previously issued to you.  Now, that is the document to which I referred.  

But we are now satisfied, because you've confirmed here in our -- in our presence, that you wish to testify without protection.  And I now formally make an order rescinding the protection order that the Court had formerly made in your favour. 

Before you begin to testify, the registrar will now assist you to take an oath to tell the truth. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.
MR. MJUI:
Witness, kindly stand up.  Raise your right hand.  Repeat the following words after me:  I solemnly -- I solemnly declare that I will speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation) 
MR. MJUI: 
Thank you.  You may sit down.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.
JUDGE KAM:
Witness, this is from the Bench.  Regarding your solemn declaration the Bench realises that you skipped a cert -- a portion.  So we would like to repeat the exercise.
MR. MJUI:
Witness, kindly stand up.
THE WITNESS:
Maybe if I had it written -- if I had it written, it would -- it would be easy for me. 
MR. MJUI: 
Sorry.  At this time I don't have anything written.  But let's do it slowly.
(Declaration made by Pascal Baylon Ndengejeho in French) 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  You will now give your testimony by responding to questions put to you by counsel representing Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, maybe to cheer you up, the advantage of the oath in France is for the registry to read and for the witness to simply say, "I agree."  It is to avoid a situation where the witness will say, "Yes, I do."  And that simplifies the -- the whole process.  If there's an advantage in that procedure, it is this one. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  And I did smile. 
MR. WEYL: 
I saw you, Mr. President.
PASCAL BAYLON NDENGEJEHO, 
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	I'm going to ask you to tell the Court your surname and your first name and spell your name, please.  
A.	My name, which is normally referred to as surname, is Sendegeho (sic), N-D-E-N-G-E-G-E-H-O (sic).  Pascal is P-A-S-C-A-L.  And Baylon is B-A-Y-L-O-N.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I find myself laughing, and that is to show how there is difficulty over the L and R in Kinyarwanda.  Such that, for somebody who is a Kinyarwanda speaker, it is diffricult to make a difference -- to distinguish between Laurent and Roland.  
THE WITNESS:
I said Baylon. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Can you give your date of birth and, without giving the full details, your current place of residence.  
A.	I was born on 17th May 1947.  And I was born at Tare.  On the sheets that I have, it is wrongly spelt.  It is T-A-R-E in Rwanda, R-W-A-N-D-A.  And since November last year I live in the -- Scandinavia.  I was in Norway, but I'm now in Finland for six months.  But otherwise, I normally live in Namibia. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  May I request you to check, as you have already started, the information in the identification sheet before you.  You've already corrected a typographical error in the name of your place of birth.  If there are no more errors to -- to be corrected, then I will request you to sign the identification sheet and date it 20th September 2010.  
MR. WEYL: 
And then I will request the registry clerk to admit it -- I will, rather, request the Chamber -- I'll request the President to admit this document into record and mark it D. NG121. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NG121 admitted) 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, while the registry clerk is passing your identification sheet on to the parties and the Chamber, let me briefly advise you of the rules that operate here in this courtroom.  Both of us, you and I, are French speakers.  My questions will be put to you in French, and you are going to answer in French.  

Either -- both questions and answers have to be interpreted into English and then recorded by the court stenographers.  I will, therefore, request you to answer sufficiently slowly for the interpretation and for the court stenographers.  And I will also request you to pause after my questions so that the interpreters can interpret my questions for you to answer.  

I will further request you to spell proper names when they are not known to those of us involved in this trial.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I'm looking up to you on account of the time. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
At this time we take our luncheon adjournment.  We take our luncheon adjournment now.  

Mr. Witness, I should advise you that during this or any adjournment while you are a witness in the trial you are not to discuss your testimony or the case.  

We take our adjournment now.
THE WITNESS:
Merci.  
(Court recessed from 1233H to 1408H)

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, everybody.  

Mr. Weyl, you may proceed now. 
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Good afternoon to everyone. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	So we are going to resume.  And I remind you that you have to pause between my question and your answer.  

Witness, you told us that you died -- or, rather, you were born in May 1947 in Paris (sic) in Rwanda.  Can you please tell us where that is.  
A.	Thank you.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Tare, not Paris.
THE WITNESS:
But Tare, I can locate it.  But in relation to what?  Is there a map where -- or should I make a sketch?  You want me to locate Tare.  In relation to what?  In relation to Tanzania?  In fact, if there was a map, I think that would make the task easier for me.  But if there is no map, I could explain in words.
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Yes.  Please specify whether it is in the north, in the south, depending on how Rwandans would understand the north and the south.  Is Tare in the north?  In which préfecture?  Can you give the Court an idea of where Tare is in Rwanda, please.  
A.	Thank you.  Tare was in Kigali préfecture, because in the meantime the administrative denomination changed.  Maybe the former -- or, rather, the former Tare commune is now in what is called the north.  But at the time referred to, it was in Kigali préfecture.  Kigali was divided into two, and Tare was in Kigali -- Kigali-rural.  

In relation to your propositions of north and south, I would say that the Tare commune was neither in the north nor in the south as -- as it was understood at the time.  I say so because the commune is located at the junction between Byumba -- Byumba is B-Y-U-M-B-A -- Ruhengeri, R-U-H-E-N-G-E-R-I.  So that commune was at the junction between Byumba and Ruhengeri at the end of Kigali if you are going towards the north-west.  
So in the understanding -- or in people's minds, Tare was neither in the south nor in the north.  In fact, Bubunko (sic), that is, the sub-préfecture of Kigali north, was neither in the north or in the south, if I may so speak, at least as ordinary people understood it who did not refer to any geographical -- or geographic map.  

I do not know whether I've answered your question.  Since I do not have a map, I cannot tell you exactly the location of Tare. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, please -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Weyl.  Were you asking something?  
MR. WEYL: 
No.  No, Mr. President. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, when you talked of the way Rwandans understood north and south, should I take it that, in the Rwandan understanding, someone who is a native of Tare is neither considered a northerner nor a southerner?  Is that what you mean? 
A.	If I -- the question is rather difficult.  In principle, the people of Tare were neither placed in the north nor in the south.  But when, for example, something had to be shared, some loot had to be shared, some posts had to be shared -- in general, if the south had some positions to be shared, it would be said the people of the north, referring to Tare.  But if it was the people of Tare sharing, they would say the people of the south.  Because there is a river called Base, B-A-S-E -- that river separates the Ruhengeri préfecture from Kigali.  Therefore, we are a few kilometres from that river.  Therefore, if something had to be shared, we were considered as being in the south.  

But when we had to share misfortunes, we were considered as brothers.  It's the same thing for the south.  When good things had to be shared, we were considered as people of the north.  But when we had to share misfortune, we were considered brothers.  Therefore, this is a buffer zone, so to speak. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, can you briefly and in the form of a sketch give us some idea of your educational background.  
A.	I do not know where there's an advantage in this -- in relation to your trial, because my educational background, the description thereof, may be rather too long.  Maybe if there is a specific question, I would answer it.  Otherwise, I will summarise.  

I went to primary school in Tare.  I went to secondary school in Kabwayi (sic).  I'll spell Kabwayi.  
K-B -- rather, K-A -- I'm sorry -- K-A-B-G-A-Y-I.  And Kabgayi is located in Gitarama préfecture.  Gitarama is G-I-T-A-R-A-M-A.  And I completed my secondary education in Dimana (sic).  Dimana is B-Y-I-M-A-N-A.  Byimana.  This is also located in Gitarama préfecture.  Gitarama, which I've have just spelt.  

Higher education, I went to university in the south of the country.  The first cycle of university studies, I did it at IPN.  This stands for Institut pédagogique national, national pedagogic institute, in Butare.  Butare is B-U-T-A-R-E.  

After that second cycle of the university, that is, for a first degree and a master's degree, I did that in France at the university of Sorbonne.  I suppose I do not need to spell Sorbonne.  Sorbonne in Paris 5.  

And the -- what in French is known as the third cycle doctorate in Los Angeles -- I did that in 
Los Angeles, California, United States of America at -- and the uni -- that was at the University of Southern California, ISC (sic).  

I do not know whether I should go into more detail.  But I believe that should be enough. 
Q.	Yes, Witness.  I thank you.  You started your professional activities after these studies.  Can you tell us what your -- what -- the jobs you did, where -- and the places where you worked.  Perhaps you should tell us the date when you started working, please.  
A.	Counsel, as I said earlier, this may be rather too long.  If I had an idea of what you are heading to, I would perhaps have it easier. 
Q.	Please just tell us the -- your main occupation, your training, and your main jobs.  Just give us an outline.  Where you worked or where you stayed in Rwanda, because I believe you worked in Rwanda.  
A.	First of all, I was a teacher, a primary school teacher.  That was on my hill, my native hill, the native hill where I was born.  And it is called Muyongwe, M-U-Y-O-N-G-W-E.  This is located on -- or, rather, in Tare commune also.  

After the first part of university education, I taught in Muramba in a secondary school.  Muramba is M-U-R-A-M-B-A.  This is located in Gisenyi préfecture.  I believe Gisenyi has often been spelled.  But I repeat the spelling, G-I-S-E -- 
Q.	It's not necessary.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You're quite right.  Mr. -- Mr. Witness, it's not necessary to spell that.  

And what counsel was trying to get you to do was not to go into that type of detail but just to give us an idea of your professional background.  So he wanted you to -- just to give us enough information so he knew what your professional background is all about.  So it -- to help us assess your testimony.  That's what his question meant.  So you can address that very simply and concisely.  
THE WITNESS:
Thereafter, I taught at IPN where I did the first part of my university education.  I spelt that already.  It's located -- IPN is located in Butare.  

Whilst I was teaching at IPN, I was also teaching in a secondary school.  I was teaching the 
social sciences.  This was located in Kansi.  Kansi is K-A-N-S-I.  This is still located in Butare.  

Later on after obtaining my doctorate degree, I taught at the Rwandan national university.  I taught until 1994 in that university.  Whilst being a university lecturer, I also served as head of department, vice-dean, and dean of the faculty of the science of education. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, I would like us to talk briefly about your political career.  I suppose that you were in Rwanda in 1989, and in 1989 it was a single-party system that prevailed.  Then after that you had a multiparty system.  

Can you tell the Court what your political career was, if you had one.  Did you join a political party?  And if yes, which one?  Give us some idea on your political affiliations, please.  
A.	Before answering your question, I may add that before the birth of multiparty politics -- or, rather, before the advent of the single party, there had been a multiparty system.  And right up to 1973 -- until 1973, I was a member of the MDR, Mouvement démocratique républicain.  

So this was -- or, rather, between 1973 and 1990 -- from '73 to 1990 there was a single-party system.  And during that period I cannot tell you where I was.  I was in the movement, like any other part -- like any other person.  But when the single-party period ended, once more, I joined the reborn MDR. 
Q.	Witness, did you have any duties to perform within the MDR, or were you just an ordinary member, a floor member, of the MDR party? 
A.	Perhaps I should choose my words.  Because I would have been like -- I would have liked to be called an ordinary member or floor member out of modesty.  

But, first of all, I was the president or chairman of the group of intellectuals of the MDR party.  And in 1992 there was the first coalition government, the first democratic coalition government.  And the MDR requested me to take the position of minister of information.  

Of course, I was also a member of the national committee.  I represented therein the Kigali -- the préfecture of Kigali-rural.  And I was chairman of that committee.  
Q.	Witness, up until what period did you serve as minister of information? 
A.	I was -- or, rather, I took the oath of office on the 16th of April 1992.  The government stopped functioning on the 16th of July 1993.  And I handed over on the 3rd of August 1993.  
Q.	Witness, what are the circumstances that caused you not to take part in the government that followed, that is, the government that was put in place after the 16th of July 1993, because you told us that you stopped being a minister on that date.  So for what reason did you stop being a minister, and why did you not accept or -- appointed to any other ministerial position after the 16th of July 1993? 
A.	Counsel, I do not know whether you want me to reveal some secrets.  But for personal reasons and after consultations with the minister of foreign affairs -- his name is Boniface Ngulinzira.  Ngulinzira is spelt as follows:  N-G-U-L-I-N-Z-I-R-A.  Ngulinzira, Boniface.  I think the spelling of Boniface is easy for everyone. 

So for personal reasons and after consultation with Ngulinzira, Boniface, I thought it necessary not to join his government.  Why?  Because the government that was formed was not recognised -- or, rather, had not -- was not the outcome of negotiations with the MDR party. 
Q.	Witness, do you want to make reference to MDR internal agreements and difficulties that occurred within the MDR?  And in that case perhaps give the Court some clarifications on those difficulties and how you went through them and what your position was within the MDR, the MDR that was going through those internal difficulties.  
A.	It is difficult to give a summary without a written document.  But, nevertheless, I'm going to give you the main points.  Within the MDR there were some people who were set aside, who were left out of the party, who were excluded from the party for serious shortcomings.  But those people did not want to hand over their positions to the party, or they did not want to surrender their prerogatives to the party.  

And that is why there was somehow three factions within the party.  I would not like to go into the splits, the divisions, and how they came about, or the individuals who were behind those schisms.  But they were -- the parties split into factions.  The parties split into three factions.  And in view of that schism, we preferred together that matters be clarified, first of all, before we enter the government.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Since you joined the government in April 1992, was the MDR involved in the negotiations with the RPF?  And if so, did that have any bearing on life and unity within the MDR? 
A.	I thank you for the -- the question.  The MDR was not only involved in the Arusha negotiations but had wanted to take charge of the leadership of those negotiations.  The minister of foreign affairs, whose name I already mentioned, Ngulinzira, Boniface, was permanently assigned to Arusha, so to speak.  And I had opportunity at that time to serve as interim minister of foreign affairs during that time.  

Let me add that our party propaganda sought to demonstrate that we were the champions or the first to call for or seek those negotiations, although clearly the negotiations were within the purview of government action and not of a single person or a single party.  

However, you must understand that in a government made up of five political parties each party wanted to look better than the other.  And so we wanted to be seen to be the champions of the Arusha negotiations as we prepared for forthcoming elections which were to hold within two years. 
Q.	Witness, in that context do you recall any meeting in Brussels in February 1992?  If so, can you tell us what the position and the consequences thereto of the MDR -- what the position of the MDR was at the Brussels conference and what the consequences of that position were.  
A.	Counsel, I did not quite understand the question because there were several meetings held in Brussels, maybe 10 or 20.  And -- so, please, I didn't quite understand your -- your question. 
Q.	Witness, I was referring to a meeting which is said to have held in Brussels in June 1992, at the end of which a joint communiqué was released, a communiqué between the RPF and other government bodies from Rwanda.  Do you have any recollection of that communiqué? 
A.	I know that there was a meeting in May (sic) -- mid -- mid-1992.  Maybe that is the meeting you are referring to.  It brought together the three parties referred to as the forces for democratic change -- or the democratic change -- forces for change, FDC.  

At the beginning it was understood at that meeting that the MRND would attend.  But I was subsequently informed that the MRND had not been invited to the meeting.  

At the end of the meeting, a communiqué was issued and signed accordingly.  But the MDR, which was represented by two personalities, namely, the chairman of the party, Mr. Twagiramungu, Faustin Twagiramungu -- Twagiramungu is spelt T-W-A-G-I-R-A-M-U-N-G-U.  Faustin Twagiramungu.  And Bagaragaza, Thaddée.  Bagaragaza is spelt B-A-G-A-R-A-G-A-Z-A.  Bagaragaza, Thaddée.  

At the level of the national committee, we were surprised that the two representatives signed against orders from the party which had indicated that no joint communiqué be signed with the RPF without prior discussion and authorisation by the national committee of the party.  Now, in answer to the question you have raised, let me say that this was the beginning of discord within the party.  

Maybe I will anticipate and state that Mr. Twagiramungu was excluded or dismissed from the party, mainly for having been a signatory to that Brussels communiqué. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, if I do understand you properly, are you saying that by signing the Brussels communiqué -- whereas the party had ordered that no such communiqué be signed -- Faustin Twagiramungu was seen to have overstepped his terms of reference and that this created a problem within the MDR? 
A.	Yes.  That is exactly correct.  It -- it was the beginning of the problems of the party.  There were other problems subsequently.  But he had overstepped his prerogatives. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, as a member of the MDR -- as a member of the steering committee of the MDR and as a member of a multiparty government, I take it that you must have had the privilege of observing political life in Rwanda between 1992 and 1994.  Can you tell the Court what your perception of the MRND was -- MRND during that time, whether it be the new format or the new format being put in place of the MRND within that context of multiparty politics.  
A.	Allow me to say that the -- the question is rather difficult and complex because it touches on several issues:  MRND during those two year -- that -- that two-year period, the MRND in the context of multiparty politics alongside other political parties.  Well, maybe it would be partial of me to answer, given that my view of the MRND was conditioned by my position as a member of the opposition.  And, therefore, there is a likelihood that I cannot be objective when I talk about the MRND.  

In any event, I was aware that, like our own party, the MRND was also undergoing some transformations.  So, Counsel, if there is a specific question to which you seek clarification, please put it to me.  

Now, if you ask me to talk about the MRND over the -- that two-year period, I really do not know how you want me to tackle it.  Would it be in terms of recruitment?  In terms of human rights?  In terms of governance or what have you?  

It would seem to me that the scope of your question is rather too broad and I'm not in a position to provide a correct answer that would meet your expectations. 
Q.	Well, you have already answered part of the question, Mr. Witness, and addressed my expectations to some extent.  But if I were to move forward, then we can be a little more specific in dealing with some more specific issues.  

Allow me at this juncture to ask you whether you knew Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and how did you get to know him, in what context?  
A.	Thank you for -- for the question.  It is much clearer now.  In fact, I should say it is entirely clear now.  I know Ngirumpatse, and I will tell you the context in which I got to know him.  

I gave you my date of birth in Tare commune.  When I was young, it was customary in our commune to know who our elders were, particularly those who excelled in some area or aspect of life.  So I got to know Ngirumpatse when I was a primary school pupil.  

But at that time I knew him only by name.  I could not recognise his face.  I had not met him in person.  But I knew him by name when I was growing up as a young boy in our commune.  

And, you see, at that time to be admitted to secondary school, less than 2 per cent of the pupils were able to make it.  And I think that this figure would speak to everybody, including those who were -- who are not statisticians.  So anybody who was within that 2 per cent was known, was popular, and their name was announced over radio so that everybody knew that in such-and-such a commune such-and-such an individual had made it to secondary school.  In some communes they did not even as much as have one candidate.  That is the context in which I got to know Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  

But beyond that I knew the members of his family, because they live -- or, rather, they used to live, my correction -- they used to live close to the parish and attended the Rulindo parish regularly.  Rulindo is spelt R-U-L-I-N-D-O.  Rulindo parish.  

That parish would become the mother parish of the parish to which I belonged.  So when we left Rulindo parish, we would go by the house of his family.  And people would say, "That is Mathieu Ngirumpatse" or "That is Mathieu Ngirumpatse's house."  But let me not spend too much time on that childhood period.  

I got to know Ngirumpatse more.  I was aware of his rise in society and his promotion to high levels within the MRND party.  Although the truth of the matter is that I did not like the MRND, although the truth is that I never was a member of an -- the MRND, I, nonetheless, recognised him as a figure of authority, beginning with the one-party state system of the time when the MRND was the lone representative of all and sundry.  

So it was not possible for an -- an intellectual, an academician, particularly one who was preaching 
civic education, not to be known.  It was not possible for such an individual to be unknown.  So as I indicated, it might take a while to talk about this.  And I hope it doesn't bother you.  

I met Mathieu Ngirumpatse in 1995 in Kinshasa.  At the time I was the secretary general of EFAC (sic), a university -- or UFAC, rather, Franco-American university of Kinshasa.  And at that time I was also the interim rector of that university.  We had set up at the time a faculty of law, and at that time I sought to obtain the services of Mathieu Ngirumpatse as a lecturer to begin with, but he was subsequently voted to the position of dean of the faculty of law at UFAC by his peers.

1450H
THE WITNESS: (continued)
	I therefore worked and collaborated with him until 1996 -- '76, when Zaire, the current DRC, was attacked and the Rwandan -- and the Congolese authorities decided to chase away all foreigners from Zaire, particularly from Kinshasa.  And that is how we fled, each one headed in their own direction. 

So when I was minister we used to meet -- we used to meet when he was director general of the national insurance company, we worked together.  I think I can spare you all those details. 

In -- in -- however, before I conclude, let me also tell you that Mathieu and I were both members of the technical committee for the development of our native commune.  Although we belonged to 
two opposing political camps, we were able to set aside those differences and work together within that technical committee for the development of our commune. 

I think I will stop there.  If -- if not, then I will -- I will start recounting the number of times we have met and it would take forever.  Thank you. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Well, maybe you have spared me the detail which I really wanted to hear of, namely, that you -- you tell me, or you tell the Court the contacts you had with Mathieu, how you met him at the time when he held office within the MRND, and when you were an office bearer with -- of the MDR.  Because that is the context in which I would like to know how you interacted with Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Did you have opportunity to work with him during that period of multiparty politics, that is, from '92 to '94, and at that time who was the man you knew on the other side? 
A.	Once again, I think it would take forever to narrate the number of times we have met and his behaviour.  But let me simply say that I belonged to a coalition government.  This means that it was formed after negotiations. 

For the MRND, the negotiating delegation was almost always headed by Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
While he led his delegation, we expected that he would impose the might of the MRND, as it was at the time, and we felt that negotiating with the MRND reasonably was impossible.  But he was able to make it possible for the negotiations to take place, and to my mind that was a positive point. 

I also know that he had relations with the leadership of the party, namely, the four top leaders of the party, members of the executive bureau, they had good relations and I do not know whether in the judgements or from previous witnesses who may have been members of the party, I don't know whether they have not testified to you about the friendly relations, and I don't know whether that is the right expression.  I don't know whether they didn't talk to you about the friendly relations he had with Faustin, Faustin Twagiramungu. 

I know, and this is not a secret, that he had good understanding with Twagiramungu and that they worked together to set up various commissions and a government at that time.  And, once again, that I acknowledged to be one of his qualities.  I recognised that while I was in government. 

I also recognised the fact that he was a man of reconciliation, of rapprochement, and bringing people together, not only in Rwanda but also in Kinshasa, and at that time he was the dean of the 
faculty of law, and in spite of the few short months he spent in that position, even the Congolese, who were then known as Zaireans, they were ready to vote him into that position 100 per cent, almost. 

Another thing I can say is that you will not find a single witness who would tell you that Mathieu was a -- a drunk or a womaniser, or what have you.  I think he was a man of great qualities, and this has been acknowledged by many. 

I am certain that all witnesses will agree with me when I say that he was a man of reconciliation, a man who united people and a man who listened attentively to others. 

I don't know whether I have answered your question.  But if you had a more specific aspect or some fact you wanted to deal with, please put it to me and I will provide the answer that I can.  

That notwithstanding, I have already stated that he was a man who was open to discussion, he was a man who worked for reconciliation, he was a man of good character and good moral standing. 
Q.	Witness, do you think that Mathieu Ngirumpatse could be a member of a clan against another clan?  In your opinion, could he be sensitive to regional considerations, could he be sensitive to ethnic considerations?  I would like you to shed light on these points dealing with 
	Mathieu Ngirumpatse's character. 
A.	Of course I have somehow answered your question relating to regions.  In fact, the people of 
	Tare commune, we did not consider ourselves as being from the south.  And to the best of my knowledge, you would not find someone from the commune who was involved in regional conflicts. 

I am sure that you will not find such a person because we thought that we were in the centre -- that we were rather taken advantage of.  And that is why on reading certain books I am surprised.  The 
Tare commune and Bumbogo area in general were not involved, in particular Mathieu was not involved in regional problems, regional conflicts. 

Now, regarding ethnic problems, first of all, the issue is that you cannot know exactly what people say when in the -- when they are in their living rooms or in their family and so on.  But as far as I know, according to information I have and which I had at that time, it would have been difficult for Mathieu to be involved in ethnic conflicts.  I also believe that it would be difficult for anyone to say that Mathieu was involved in ethnic conflicts. 

I read some stories.  And, Counsel, I like to -- I also have the honour of telling the Judges and the Prosecutor -- I would like to say that any ethnic conflicts involving Mathieu would be invented.  When it is said that Mathieu caused the death of Tutsi, in fact, in his family there were Tutsis.  Also in his 
wife's family there were Tutsis.  If you look at the list -- maybe you've had the opportunity of looking or seeing the list of those people who were able to run away from massacres who fled towards Mathieu -- you would see that in that list there are Hutus, Tutsis.  I did not hear any mention of Twas, but I heard of Hutus and Tutsis. 

We have members of the MDR who say that they were saved by Mathieu. 

You also have -- this was something on the television -- and Rwanda -- major -- Canadian -- or rather, a Rwandan singer who is today in Canada, he was saved by Mathieu.  I believe the name would be given you by other witnesses who were more present on the ground than myself, because I was one of those who was first to run away, to flee. 

So I would be surprised to hear that there is a witness who would come before this Court, either for the Prosecution or Defence, to say that Mathieu was involved in matters of ethnic conflict. 

This means that -- this would mean that he had an internal conflict with himself since he lived with Hutus, since he lived with Tutsis.  So I never heard about his involvement in ethnic conflict. 

If you would allow me -- and this is no secret.  I know that when I came, on several occasions mention was made of someone who gave -- who passed on information to UNAMIR, and that that person was a Tutsi.  The person was chased away from his work, but the person returned to his work thanks to Mathieu.  I also know that when I came a few years ago this was an issue.  

In any case, there is evidence that Mathieu was somebody who brought together both Hutus and Tutsis.  I do not have to mention any specific names.  I thank you. 
Q.	I thank you, Witness, for those details.  Witness, according to you, who appointed Ngirumpatse as Secretary General of the MRND and then president of the MRND?  Why, according to you, did he accede to those positions?  Why was he appointed to those positions? 
A.	Counsel, I said that I was not a member of the MRND and that I never occupied any senior position within the MRND party.  What is certain is that there were elections, and I do remember that there were several candidates and that Ngirumpatse was elected.  Perhaps this confirms what I said, namely, that he was someone who brought together people.  He was elected both by people from the north and south, both by Hutus and Tutsis of the MRND party. 

Now, as to the details of how he was elected, I do not have those details.  Well, I would say that I was not interested in such details.  What is certain is that he was elected and I remember that there were several candidates.  There were even people who said that they would not elect someone from the north, or they would not elect someone from the south.  What I thought I understood is that the electors wanted someone who would not be from the north or from the south, someone who would not have a leaning or a bias for the north or for the south.  They wanted somebody who would bring together everyone, especially as the MRND was losing members.  I therefore think that the members of the party were happy, were lucky to have someone like Mathieu. 

Moreover, as I told you, the Bumbogo was an area of the country that was neither in the north nor in the south.  And even the executive secretary, the previous executive secretary came from the 
Bumbogo area.  Therefore, the Bumbogo region offered, so to speak, an opportunity to bring together people both from the north and the south, to bring together Tutsis and Hutus because the préfecture had a balanced proportion of Hutus and Tutsis in the general population. 

This is what I can say while I -- I would say that he was elected by his -- it's the congress that elected him to those positions.  I did not attend that congress.  I would not say that I participated and that I was one of those who elected him. 
Q.	I thank you, Witness. 

Witness, you were not a member of the MRND.  That is a fact.  Therefore you were a stranger to how it functioned.  Nevertheless, during the period when Ngirumpatse was national secretary of the MRND and then president of the MRND, did you ever hear speeches that Mathieu Ngirumpatse ever made?  Do you remember any such speeches, and if yes can you give details thereof to the Court? 
A.	It was my duty to listen to speeches.  I even recorded them.  So I listened to speeches.  I do not know which question you want me to answer.  I listened to speeches.  I recorded them.  I analysed them.  And I even shared them with my party and even within the government. 
I did not clearly understand your question, because speeches were recorded by the services under my authority and I had copies of those recordings.  I -- in fact, I kept a number of transcripts of the speeches.  But I was not a member of the MRND, and therefore I cannot tell you what impact those speeches had on the MRND.  I know the impact they had on the population, but not as a member of the MRND party.  In fact, maybe I did not clearly understand your question. 
Q.	Witness, if you did not understand my question, I nevertheless understood your answer. 

When you say that you recorded speeches -- that your services, services under your authority recorded speeches, that you listened to speeches, that being the case, could you tell the Court the capacity in which you listened to speeches, which specific service under your authority recorded the speeches and what views did you make of the speeches recorded.  Perhaps you yourself could shed light on that.  Otherwise I could ask the question again.  

But between 1992 and 1994 -- or rather, 1992 and 1993, you were a minister.  Is it in that capacity that the services under your authority -- under your authority recorded the speeches?  Perhaps you may want to enlighten the Court on this.  
A.	What I did not say, and what was not put to me as a question, is that the 
	l'office rwandais de l'information, later on the radio and the television were under my authority.  I was in charge of the radio and the television.  To facilitate my work, I had requested that the former office of my predecessor -- predecessor remain at my disposal even though I had relocated to another office.  But the former office of my predecessor remained at my disposal to enable me to meet people from the radio and people from the television. 

I also requested that all speeches made by political parties be recorded, especially during rallies, and that the recording should be given to my office.  It is in that context that all speeches were recorded and I had copies of all the speeches and I took my time to analyse them.  Therefore I also analysed Mathieu's speeches, as well as the speeches made by other parties.  I did not have any preference for any speech.  I listened to all speeches.  I took my time to listen to all speeches, and it is therefore in that context that I listened to Mathieu's speeches. 

Moreover, I would say Mathieu's speeches did not have any peculiarity in respect to the period we were in, in respect to the war and so on.  

What I may perhaps add is that the former president of the party -- I had said that no party would be given privilege over another.  I had asked the president of the republic that speeches should not be broadcast or aired before news, as was the case before.  But what happened before was that the president's speech would be aired before the news and I had requested that this practice be stopped by ORINFOR. 

So Mathieu did not have the privilege of having his speech aired before 
Twagiramungu's speeches --Twagiramungu, who was the chairman of my party -- or Mugenzi.  Or the speeches of a leader of another party recognised by the government. 
Q.	Witness, I thank you.  Since you heard all the speeches made by Ngirumpatse, can you tell the Court whether any one of them contained ethnic utterances, utterances requesting people to show hate or hate speeches against the Tutsi.  Did you hear any in -- did you hear that in any of his speeches? 
A.	Counsel, you are asking me a rather vague question.  To be honest, I do not know what you are driving at. 

However, my answer is that, to be candid, there were two or three important speeches made by Mathieu.  But one -- rather, two, were aired at the time I was minister.  The other speech was aired, I believe, on the 16th of April 1994.  At that time I was no longer a minister.  But that speech struck me.  I even had to discuss it with him and to congratulate him on the speech because he had contradicted one of the most influential ministers of his party who, in Gisenyi préfecture had said that it was necessary to get rid of some people.  I think he challenged that minister.  He said, "No, that that cannot be said."  In -- in fact he challenged that minister. 

The other two speeches of his, I cannot tell you exactly when he made them, but perhaps he does remember the dates.  One of them was made after a rally, an MRND rally held in Gitarama.  During that rally, people who had accompanied members of the party had committed acts of violence, and Ngirumpatse made a speech against that. 

Even the radio asked me whether the speech was -- could the registered and I said, "Yes.  It should be registered and it should be aired so that people should know that Ngirumpatse is in disagreement.  That the leader of the MRND party was in disagreement with acts of that nature." 

That event happened between Gitarama and Kigali on a hill called Kamoni.  Perhaps Mr. Ngirumpatse would remember that event.  But Ngirumpatse totally condemned what the young people had done. 

The third speech that I talked about -- well, I would say -- well, I shouldn't talk about it because the conditions under which I listened to it were not when I was a minister -- were not ministerial.  I believe it was during the inauguration, the swearing-in -- or, rather, the inauguration of somebody who had won a contract, a contract called Beck's, and Mathieu had said that the Interahamwe -- well, I'll translate the term from Kinyarwanda -- that people who were "eating people's goats" were not members of the MRND party. 

I jumped in surprise.  So I said I was surprised.  I -- paradoxically people who were there who were members of the MRND said, "No.  Why should Mathieu make a speech on what young people who are enjoying themselves are doing?"  

But I do remember that of the three speeches -- I remember those three speeches. 

The other speeches, if you have them I could tell you what I think of them, but I do not remember them by heart.  However, I believe that they were normal speeches.  If there had been any -- any departure from government policy, I would have realised that and that would have struck me.  But I do not remember any speech that was a departure from government policy.  That is, the government of which I was a member, I should add that. 
Q.	Witness, I thank you. 

Sometimes you say "et cetera, et cetera."  And that is exactly what I'm expecting you to say, something more precise.  When you say "et cetera, et cetera" regarding the content of a speech given on the
16th of April 1994 by Mathieu Ngirumpatse, as you would understand, I would like you to tell me what this "et cetera, et cetera" represents.  Was it an appeal?  Was it incitement to increase disorder, cases of disorder, a call to eliminate the Tutsi?  What is the content of this "et cetera, et cetera", what does it relate to?  What exactly -- what exactly did Mathieu say on the 16th of April 1994? 
A.	Counsel, I thank you for the remark relating to my use of "et cetera, et cetera", but if you were in my position you would do exactly what I did, because I do not know exactly what the Court wants to hear.  And if I start elaborating I -- perhaps I will be boring, I'll be boring to both the Judges and the Prosecution and even to you.  That is why when I realise that some point may not be of importance to the Court I may say "et cetera, et cetera".  But it could be of importance to the Court without me being aware of that.  And it is in such con -- or situations that I say "et cetera, et cetera". 

Regarding the 16th of April 1994, I was not in Rwanda.  At that time I was in the Congo, the then Zaire which is now called Congo.  However, I was following what was happening because I thought that if the massacres came to an end I had to -- or, I could return home.  I was a leader.  I still had the keys of the office of the dean of -- faculty.  And we had a programme in the MDR, a programme which had been put in place.  That programme had to be implemented and I was one of those to implement the programme.  So it was in -- it was in my interests to return, and therefore had to know exactly what was happening. 

On the 16th of April there was a rally, a rally which was held in Gisenyi préfecture.  When you are going down towards Gitarama this would be in the Kabaya sub-préfecture.  Kabaya is K-A-B-A-Y-A.  And you yourself could carry out investigations. 

In any case, there were two ministers.  If my memory serves me right, there was an MRND minister, another minister from an opposition party.  These ministers made some utterances which personally I did not appreciate.  I was expecting that people react to those utterances and at that point Mathieu reacted.  What they said in Kinyarwanda -- what they said was in Kinyarwanda and I should translate. 
I translate.  It is necessary to get rid of people -- or, rather, it is not appropriate to move about with people who do not share the same ideas with you. 

In fact I was happy that on -- in the evening, in the 8 p.m. news, Ngirumpatse's words were repeated.  His words to the effect that "No, we cannot get rid of people, we are all Rwandans."  This struck me and this is all I remember from his intervention or speech.  But of course his speech was much longer than that, he said many other things.  But I was pleased to hear that.  Even as a refugee in a foreign land I remember that. 

Perhaps you have some recordings of the speech in this Court, recordings of the speech of the 
16th of April. 
Q.	Witness, unfortunately, we do not have all the recordings of speeches of 1994.  We regret that some may not be available, because if they were perhaps they could exculpate Mathieu. 

Witness, what I also thought I understood from you a while ago is that in your position as 
minister of information you paid a great deal of attention to the idea of a timesharing over the radio or television. 

Were there -- were speeches censored -- were speeches censored, or was there any speech which contained utterances inciting to hatred? 
A.	Perhaps I would answer with respect to the period when I was in a position of authority.  I had put in place a rule, what in English would be called sharing -- timesharing, so people had a limited amount of time during which they could air their views over the radio.  When I talk of people, I mean political parties. 

Now, this sharing time had been discussed with political parties.  We agreed -- we agreed on a timesharing schedule. 

Furthermore, I had requested, or required that what then was referred to as fiery speeches which could cause a split or divisions among the population by encouraging the national army -- or speeches encouraging the national army, I had said that such utterances could not be aired.  And that is why I required that before what was said during a rally could be aired, I should be given an idea of what it was about in order to be sure that this would not create any antagonism amongst the people. 

So this was not for Mathieu or Twagiramungu, this concerned everyone, including the president of the republic. 
Of course with the exception of when it was necessary for me -- or to -- to score some points -- when it was necessary for me to say that, "Well, people are going against government policy, I -- I could sometimes allow some speeches to be aired."  But after airing such speeches, I would say that I did not agree with them.  So in a way I censored some speeches, especially if the speeches were made by the president of republic or by fellow ministers.  I could allow the speeches to be aired, but after that I would want the person who made the speech and I would inform other members of government of that. 
Q.	Witness, to the best of your recollection, did you ever have to censor a speech made by Ngirumpatse for the reasons you have just given or for any other reasons? 
A.	I think I've answered that question.  Nevertheless, I'm going to repeat what I said.  If there had been a point that was in conflict with government policy, or a point that was in conflict with my party policy, I would have been sensitive to that.  I would have felt that antagonism, it would have struck me.  If I tell you that there was no speech that struck me in particular, it is because I did not hear any such speech and I did not hear anybody talk about such a speech. 

Here at the Tribunal you have copies -- criticism -- criticisms of speeches made by the head of state.  You have copies of speeches I made, criticisms made by party leaders.  But if my memory serves me right, I did not have to intervene or to criticise any speech made by Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 

But you will see that I had opportunity to criticise speeches by other ministers, my colleagues.  I criticised and even prohibited the airing of a speech by the president of the republic.  But as far as I can remember, I did not -- I never prohibited the airing of any speech by Ngirumpatse.  Neither did I have to criticise any of his speeches, unless you remind me of any speech.  But as far as I remember I never criticised any of his speeches nor prevented the airing thereof. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 
MR. WEYL:  
Mr. President, I am a little bit ahead of time, but I would request the Chamber to order a break.  And we have gained one minute.  Can the Court order a break, an adjournment?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Well, how much more time do you think you have with this witness?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I hope to conclude tomorrow around the mid-morning break.  Perhaps before that time or slightly after the mid-morning break. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Thank you. 

Mr. Witness, we are going to take our adjournment now and we resume tomorrow morning. 

THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Mr. President. 
(Court adjourned at 1532H)
