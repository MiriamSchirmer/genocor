MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. KOUAMBO:  
Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Jøensen, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, 11th of November 2009, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al., Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Registrar.  

The appearances are the same.  

Mr. Weyl.
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, Mr. Ngirumpatse's back in the courtroom with us today, and I would like to point out to the Trial Chamber that he's still very weak, he's still very tired, but he has decided to be present here today and not to consult the doctor again.  

The Trial Chamber is aware that we filed a new motion in order to bring this attention -- this situation to its attention.  I would like the Trial Chamber to -- to examine the issues contained in the motion because we have renewed our concerns since -- so far as Mr. Ngirumpatse's health is concerned.  

I would, therefore, like to invite the Trial Chamber to address our motion with dispatch.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  We welcome back Mr. Ngirumpatse, and we hope he continues to be well enough to participate.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you begin your testimony, you have to take an oath to tell the truth, and the registrar will now assist you to do that. 
THE WITNESS:
Okay. 
(Declaration made by Révérien Uwurukundo in French)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, you'll give your testimony by responding to questions put to you by the lawyers designated for that purpose.  And you'll respond, first of all, to the lawyer representing Joseph Nzirorera who will begin his examination now.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Good morning.  

Good morning. 

Mr. President, this is our witness, Révérien Uwurukundo.  That's U-W-U-R-U-K-U-N-D-O.  
RÉVÉRIEN UWURUKUNDO,
first having been duly sworn,
 testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Mr. Rukundo, can you please tell us if you have in front of you the personal information sheet. 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I have before me the PAS -- PIS as -- while the PIS -- the information contained in the PIS is correct. 
Q.	Thank you.
MR. ROBINSON:
And, Mr. President, at this time we would ask that that document be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ670. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ670 admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, can you tell the Trial Chamber, first of all, what has been your education?  
A.	I am a jurist by training.  I have a first degree in law obtained in 1987 at the university of Rwanda.  
Q.	And after that, have you worked as a lawyer? 
A.	I, first of all, worked as a jurist with the commercial bank of Rwanda where I was in charge of commercial disputes, and I had to recover debts from debtors.  I also had to take debtors to court in order to recover -- or collect debts that were owed to the bank.  After that, I worked with the 
Union des banques populaires du Rwanda where I was also in charge of the administrative and contentious matters.  I worked in that capacity for almost two years.  And I was also responsible for collecting all the loans owed by debtors and also to take to court all those who were owing the bank.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  Have you also worked as a bourgmestre in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes, indeed, Counsel.  I worked as a bourgmestre from November 1988 up until February 1992 -- that is, for a period of almost three years -- or, say, two and a half years.  That was before I joined the banques populaires du Rwanda, that is, the people's bank of Rwanda.  Thank you.  
Q.	Thank you.  And what was the name of the commune in -- that you were the bourgmestre of, and in which préfecture was it located? 
A.	It was the Nyamugali commune in the Ruhengeri préfecture.  This is a commune that is at the far end of the préfecture, that is, if you're going towards Kigali.  We shared a border with the Byumba préfecture, and also with the Kigali-Nyamugali préfecture. 
MR. ROBINSON:
And Nyamugali is N-Y-A-M-U-G-A-L-I.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, in the period of multipartyism, were you a member of one of the political parties? 
A.	Yes, indeed, Counsel.  I should point out that, before the advent of multiparty politics, we had 
a single party, that is, MRND, and with the advent of multiparty politics, I didn't find it necessary to change -- to move from the MRND party, so I remained in that party.  Thank you. 
Q.	Now, in July of 1994, did you go into exile? 
A.	Yes, indeed, Counsel.  Like most Rwandans, I went into exile to the former Zaire, that is, the DRC where I remained in the Kahindo camp, north of Goma, up until October-November.  And I say October-November because the camp was attacked and so we were compelled -- well, I personally was compelled to return to the country.  
Q.	And after you returned to Rwanda, did there come a time when you were arrested? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  When I arrived in my native commune -- that was on the 
19th of November 1996 -- I was welcomed by the members of the population.  But one month later, the police came and arrested me at my home one morning.  The time was about 6 a.m., so I was arrested and put in detention in the commune holding cell.  
Q.	And did end up -- did you find yourself in the Ruhengeri prison? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  When I was arrested, it was on the 16th of December 1996.  I stayed in the holding cell for almost three weeks, because on the 7th of January 1997, I was taken to Ruhengeri -- first of all, 
to the Ruhengeri brigade, which is a post managed by the gendarmerie, where I spent two weeks before being taken to the Ruhengeri central prison.  So I was taken to the Ruhengeri central prison around the 24th -- the 21st of January 1997.  
Q.	How long did you remain at Ruhengeri prison? 
A.	I remained in the Ruhengeri central prison up until the 28th of January 2003.  But in the meantime, I was taken to another prison; that is, in June 2002 I was transferred to the Gisenyi prison where I spent virtually six months before returning to the Ruhengeri central prison.  
Q.	And what were the charges against you, and how were they finally resolved? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  When I was arrested by the police, I had a warrant of arrest on which I was charged with genocide.  I was -- I was supposed to have taken part in the genocide.  But as the trial went on, the counts were spelt out and they numbered three.  I was presumed to have killed a certain Sostène Kabeja and his wife.  And later, I was accused of causing bodily injuries on a certain Rwamuningi, which lead to his death, and then I was also accused of illegal detention and torture of a certain Kabeja.  In fact, there were three of them:  There was Kabeja, Hitiyise and a certain Ramazani.  
I really quite -- I can't quite recall the third name, but there were three of them -- actually, the name was Radjabu.  

So I was charged with having detained those three persons illegally and having tortured them.  
That, in a nutshell, is what my indictment contained when I was arrested and put into the Ruhengeri central prison.  
Q.	And how were those charges resolved against you? 
A.	After investigations were carried out by the deputy -- the public prosecutor in the court of appeal -- and the investigations took about three years.  I was questioned on several occasions.  In fact, many people from my commune was -- were also interviewed, after which the file was classified by the procureur général in the court of concessions.  

But they had to be 100 per cent sure that I was innocent, and so I had to be taken before the population.  So I was summoned, and this was during the time -- well, during the period 2002-2003.  
So there was the post-Gacaca period, and people were being prepared to speak the truth on what happened from 1990 in the country.  So we were taken there as an experiment.  

I was not alone; I was amongst a group of detainees.  And there were two categories of detain -- of detained person -- of detainees who had pleaded guilty, that is, people who had confessed.  And there was another category of detained persons whose files were empty, and I was in that category because my file had been classified without anything further to add to it.  

So we were -- people went to the collines.  And there was a commission that was set up in each prefecture, and that commission included the public prosecutor, who was the chairperson.  The commission also included the represent -- representative of the survivors, who was a lawyer, and there was also a representative of the police, a represent -- a representative of the military intelligence, the representative of civilian intelligence, as well as the bourgmestre of the commune concerned.  He was the secretary of that commission.  

So we went down to Nyamugali.  That was on the 23rd of January 2003.  The members of the population expressed themselves freely on each count, and they exposed the truth insofar as the various counts were concerned -- as the various charges were concerned.  After that session I was solemnly declared innocent, and, therefore, I had to leave the prison.  So we returned to prison in order to fulfil the formalities for us to be released from prison.  So we left the prison on the 28th, to go to what is referred to as the solidarity camp where -- which lasted up until the 5th of May 2003, and that is when I left the prison.  Thank you.  
Q.	During the time that you were in Ruhengeri prison, was there an occasion when you and some other authorities were segregated from the rest of the population in Ruhengeri prison? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  While I was in the Ruhengeri central prison -- in fact, there was a period during which we were separated from the rest of the detainees.  Now, what happened -- this was in 1988, the procureur -- the prosecutor general in the Ruhengeri court of appeal -- that is -- his name was Kar -- Karugarama, Tharcisse, he came -- he led a delegation which included the president of the 
court of first instance and the deputy prosecutors.  So it was a delegation of about ten persons.  So in the meeting that they held at the Ruhengeri central prison, he explained to the detainees the tenor of the new law relating to confessions and guilty pleas.  

Now, after having explained in a nutshell the content of that law, he announced to the detainees that the policy that was being applied by the government was aimed at releasing most of the detainees because most of them were farmers.  They perpetrated acts of genocide, but they were not aware of what they were doing, so they were not at all responsible for the genocide that occurred in Rwanda.  

So insofar as they were concerned, most of the farmers had to be released, because the government was persuaded that the genocide was the handiwork of the authorities and executed by those mere citizens or farmers who executed the policy adopted by the authorities.  So the farmers had to be released so that they should go and take care of their families and their business on condition that they confess and accuse those political, religious and military authorities, including businessmen -- that is, all those who were supposed to have prepared the genocide.  So that was a prerequisite for them to be released.  

So at the end of meeting, there was a list of 36 persons that was prepared, including people that were concerned -- considered dignitaries, officials or responsible persons.  And that list, therefore, as I said, contained 36 persons.  And on that list you would have bourgmestres, the conseillers, former religious leaders, businessmen.  
And, we were isolated in a cell where we virtually no longer had any access to the outside world.  
The keys of that cell was in the hands of the chief warden -- the chief warder of the prison, and he's the one who opened it -- who would open it to give us food.  So this -- how we were separated from the rest of the detainees in order for those detainees to more easily accuse us without any fear.  Thank you.  
Q.	And that meeting took place in 1998; correct? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  I can't recall the exact dates, but this is the period that coincided with the return of peace to the Ruhengeri area, because in the Ruhengeri area there was what was called the war of intellectuals.  And that is when -- that is when they fell back on Congo, in fact, in Ruhengeri during that period.  It must have been August-September 1988 (sic) or thereabout. 
Q.	Okay.  
MR. ROBINSON:
We keep seeming to have the same problem with the translation.  When he says "1998", we're getting translated 1988 (microphones overlapping)...  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Actually, he said 1988.  (French spoken).  He didn't say (French spoken)...Counsel. 
THE WITNESS:
(French spoken)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Well, now he says (French spoken).  That is '98.  Now he said 1998 and not '88.
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, please keep your answers short, because I just asked you the year, and that's all I needed to know.  So please try to keep your answers more brief so we can get through this.  

Now, the person who chaired that meeting, can you spell his name for us? 
A.	Karugarama, Tharcisse. 
Q.	How do you spell that? 
A.	K-A-R-U-G-U -- can I repeat the spelling?  The name is K-A-R-U-G-A-R-A-M-A.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  And do you know what his current position is in Rwanda? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I was just wondering if he'd got it or if you would have preferred to have him written it out on a piece of paper?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I think he got it now, K-A-R-U-G-A-R-A-M-A.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So what is his current position now in Rwanda? 
A.	From the information I know -- because I don't live in Rwanda -- well, from the news that I had lately, I -- he's the minister of justice.  I don't know if he's still the minister of justice even today, but from the latest information that I had he was the minister of justice.  
Q.	Now, while you were in the Ruhengeri prison, did you know another prisoner by the name of ************************? 
A.	I know him, Counsel.  I know ********************* very well.  In fact, we spent virtually six years together and even -- we were together in the solidarity camp.  I know him very well.  
Q.	Now, did you ever have any discussions with him concerning the fabrication of evidence against authorities? 
A.	Thank you.  As I have pointed out, there was a law that was adopted, and that was intended to cause people to plead guilty and to leave the prison -- and to be released from prison after having pleaded guilty and ask for a pardon.  And so, according to that law, most of the detainees would have spent seven years -- and these are people of the second category that would have confessed.  

So before we were isolated, this law was made available in the prison, and people had already started acting along those lines even before the prosecutor general came to the prison in order to raise awareness of the detainees.  

Now, ************* had come to me, because he was already in contact with a certain deputy prosecutor who had already told him what was wanted, even before the arrival of the procureur -- prosecutor general.  ************* had already been in contact with the deputy prosecutor who had explained the tenor of that law to him following the government -- the new government policy, so he had already started preparing his confession.  

So to sum up, he contacted me in order to ask me how he could make his confession, that is, before the prosecutor general came and before we were isolated.  So that is what he talked to me about, and that is what we discussed.  
Q.	How long were you in isolation? 
A.	We remained in isolation up until 1999, one -- that is, for one year and a few months because in 
1999 -- well, we came out of isolation towards the end of 1999.  Thank you.  
Q.	And after you came out of isolation, did you again have contact with ****************? 
A.	Yes.  We were together because he had become the general captain of the detainees.  And during that period I was made responsible -- that is, after the isolation I had to manage a project that was financed by the European Union within the prisons called PRI International.  So this had to help the detainees to be productive when they leave prison.  So I was in charge of that programme whilst ************* was the general captain.  So we worked together -- we collaborated with each other.  
Q.	And did you ever discuss Mr. Nzirorera with ********************? 
A.	Exactly.  Just before the isolation, *********** -- as I pointed out a short while ago -- had already started preparing his confession in which he was accusing the former officials, the former political leaders, the former businessmen, all the -- those that were in leadership from his region.  So he showed me the draft where he mentioned Nzirorera's name to the effect that he alighted from a helicopter in the morning of the 7th, in Nkuli -- or in Mukingo, that is, he alighted from an -- a helicopter in Mukingo in the morning of the 7th, in order to distribute fuel in order for people to get into action by burning the houses of Tutsis.  

So that is where we spoke about Nzirorera.  But subsequently, we always had the -- had occasion to talk, and, you know, he showed me -- or they showed me their confessions.  
Q.	And was ******************** telling you that he was recalling the events about Mr. Nzirorera or he was fabricating those events? 
MR. VIRANI:
Your Honour, I'd object to that question and ask counsel to rephrase.  He's clearly suggesting a response to the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson (inaudible). 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	In your conversation with *************, did he tell you whether or not what he was confessing to concerning Mr. Nzirorera was true? 
A.	He told me that the deputy prosecutor had asked him to include at all costs Nzirorera's name in the operation of the -- launching the genocide in Nkuli-Mukingo.  To him, it wasn't true.  But according to the deputy prosecutor, he had to look for a way of including him in the beginning of the massacres; that he should be like someone who launched the massacres on the ground, that is, on the field.  Well -- so in order to come up with a scenario, he had to say that he came by helicopter in the morning of the 7th.  
But he told me, personally, that that was not true, but for the deputy prosecutor he had to look for a way of implicating or including Nzirorera in the triggering of the genocide on the ground.  

Well, I told *************, "My brother, do you think this is going to stick?  Will this stand at the very time that the Rwandan army didn't have helicopters with which to fight against the RPF?  How could Nzirorera have found a helicopter with which he came to Mukingo in the morning of the 7th to start the massacres?  I mean, talking about elementary logic for somebody who knows Rwanda, who knows the type of community that was there, was this going to -- was this going to stand?" 

He told me, "Well, I think I need to go and address this again with the deputy prosecutor in order for us to come up with another solution."  

So he went back again, after which he came to me and said the solution was for him to put him amongst the people who planned, who distributed weapons even before the genocide started.  They should be included amongst the people who sensitised people, who gave all the logistics and equipment with which the genocide had to be perpetrated.  

Now, I told him, "If you think this is going to stand -- I don't know."  But I started distancing myself from him because, even while in prison, people had started saying that there were people who were intimidating detainees, so I started taking my distance.  But in spite of it all, in the month of June 2002, 
I was taken away from prison so that the system should work as they wanted it to.  That is it.  And 
thank you.  
Q.	And while you were at Ruhengeri prison, did you also know a person known as ********* 
A.	I do.  I know him, Counsel.  
Q.	And do you know whether or not ***************** had any role in the fabrication of evidence against the authorities? 
A.	I should start by saying right away that in order to start the fabrication of testimonies -- well, ************* was assisted by a group including ******************************************.  They all hailed from the same region and they participated virtually stage by stage in all the operations for exterminating Tutsis in their area, and even beyond their region, that is, Nkuli.  That is, they acknowledged that they'd come to Ruhengeri and right up to Nyakinama.  

So since they had made their confessions, they wanted the various authorities, wherever they had been, to be targeted, that is, after they had acknowledged that they perpetrated genocide, they had to cite all the figures of authority in those vast regions in order for them to be charged.  So *****************, *********************** -- they were all in the same group.  Thank you.  
Q.	And do you know whether or not they collaborated on their information to try to make it seem to be consistent? 
MR. VIRANI:
Your Honour, again, I would ask Mr. Robinson to rephrase the question.  The witness -- the evidence should be coming from the witness's mouth, not from my friend. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Is that a leading question, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think so.
MR. ROBINSON:
"Do you know whether or not" -- does that suggest an answer "yes"?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I thought so.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  I can ask a different question.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So can you tell us -- 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	-- with respect to *********, what activities did you observe him engage in concerning the fabrication of evidence? 
A.	**************** were in the same group.  And after ********* went to the office of the prosecutor to meet the prosecutor, the people of Mukingo sat together.  They sat together and focussed their accusations on the authorities, but they also acknowledged acts that they did not commit.  

Let me give you an example.  ******************* at a certain point in time asserted that they went to Nyakinama.  It was intended to include Bizimungu, Augustin, who was supposed to be at Nyakinama because there was an attack there.  So to include Bizimungu, Augustin, they went as far as acknowledging acts that they did not commit at Nyakinama because there the bourgmestre was in prison.  He explained how the acts were committed.  He explained how these people acknowledged acts that they -- in which they did not participate.  

I followed the trial of my colleague bourgmestre, and I followed the conclusions, particularly that 
of the bourgmestre of Nyakinama.  And meanwhile, he was acquitted, but he explained how 
Bizimungu, Augustin, did not play any role in Nyakinama.  So briefly, *****************************; ********************** were in the same -- involved in the same process.  And three or four of them were doing exactly the same thing; they were accomplices in the fabrication of evidence for false accusation.  They were 100 per cent accomplices, but it was ************* who was directing everything.  Thank you.  
Q.	Thank you.  Did you also know a prisoner by the name of ***********************************? 
A.	Yes, I know him.  He was a communal policeman.  I think so.  
(Pages 1 to 10 by Jean Baigent)











0950H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Did he have any role in the fabrication of evidence, to your knowledge? 
A.	Yes, that is the case.  From the information that was given to me by ********************, particularly when we were in the solidarity camp, *****************************, fabricated evidence or made false accusations against certain authorities, and I recall Setako and others because I had the opportunity to read their evidence.  But the information that was given to me by ********** was to the effect that he was contacted to bring false accusations against Setako. 
Q.	And did you know a person by the name of ************* at the prison in Ruhengeri? 
A.	Yes, I know him as well.  He's from Mukingo. 
Q.	Did he have any role in the fabrication of evidence that you know of? 
A.	Yes, *************** -- they were contacted so as to bring false accusations against Setako. This is information that was brought to my notice by one ************************. 
Q.	When you left the Ruhengeri prison, you told us you went to a solidarity camp; can you tell us where that was? 
A.	We left the prison.  The release order was signed on the 28th, and we were released from the prison on the 29th of January 2003.  We went straight to the Nkumba solidarity camp.  It is the commune of Ruhengeri, close to the border with Uganda.  We remained there until the 5th of May of the same year, that is, 2003.  So, 29th January to 5th May 2003.  Thank you. 
Q.	And were any of these other people ****************************** -- at the solidarity camp? 
A.	We went together on the same day but their case created a problem since they had acknowledged and admitted to serious acts that put them in the first category.  They were not expected to be released. The first list of the people who were to be -- they were not on the first list of people to be released.  So, that created a problem.  So they complained to the prison directorate that they were not released. But they were told, "You are in the first category on account of the gravity and scope and the disaster that you have caused.  You are placed in the first category and the people in the first category are not concerned by this release." 

So the director -- the prison director said, "I will enquire."  But he said on the basis of the information -- they called Kigali, the office of the prosecutor, Gahima (sic) -- the prosecutor, Gahima, Gerard -- and on the basis of the information that was given to him, he said, "You should release them."  But he was not ready.  He did not agree.  But he said since they had given important services, which I have explained to you, Gahimana gave the order they should be released with the others.  So we went to the Nkumba solidarity camp.   But that created a lot of problems in the prison. 
Q.	While these people were in the Ruhengeri prison were there any other benefits that they had as a result of having fabricated evidence against authorities? 
A.	It was --
MR. VIRANI:
I apologise for the delayed objection,  but, again, I believe Mr. Robinson is leading the witness and I would ask him to please stop and rephrase.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, maybe we have a misunderstanding about what is a leading question.  If it suggests an answer, then it's a leading question.  My question was whether there were any other benefits that these people had.  He could say yes or no. 
MR. VIRANI: 
Your Honour, yes or no responses are to be elicited in cross-examination. 
MR. ROBINSON:
So there is a prohibition on yes or no questions in direct examination.  That is the first time I have heard that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We think the foundation has already been laid by the testimony that there were some benefits.  The question can be answered. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Counsel. 

So it was known to all the detainees, and the director explained that those who confessed to their crimes should have the priority of being on the list of those who have been released because for a detainee to get out of prison was a happy occasion; to be able to go out and breathe freely and work was a good thing. 

And instructions were given to all directors outside to give priority to those who had confessed to their crimes.  In terms of visits -- when relatives who come and visit -- detainees who had confessed to their crimes were allowed to speak freely with visitors who came to visit them.  Whereas, the others were not allowed to even greet their relatives.  So they would bring food, they would put it somewhere.  You wave each other; you can shout greetings to each other from a distance; you take your food and go back to prison.  But those who confessed to their crimes benefited from this advantage of being able to speak to their relatives without any supervision in prison. 

Now, specifically for those who were mentioned here, ***************, there was one who came here to Arusha as part of the trials which are taking place here.  These people spent about nine months. When they came back, they went back into prison but they were allowed to go out without asking for authorisation from whomever.  They would knock on the door; they would go out.  Nobody would ask them where they were going. 

During the period that they were here, they were authorised to be able to buy musical equipment; they were able to dance as they wished; play music as they wished.  So, they had real advantages within the prison.  Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	When you were at the solidarity camp with these people, was there any activity concerning fabrication of evidence that took place there? 
A.	Thank you.  When we got to the solidarity camp, the programme was divided into two.  The first part lasted about three months, during which we were to listen to speeches from the authorities telling us how the country was progressing, and this would enable us to reintegrate into the society.  They were bringing speakers from all sides, specialised in economics, the judiciary.  So, it was to prepare us and give us the prevailing situation in the country. 

The last month -- the month of April -- focus on the fabrication of evidence because in that month they told us, "Listen, you have confessed to your crimes.  Today, we want you to consider that you are free. There is no doubt about it.  You cannot go back to prison if you tell the truth.  But, it will be commune by commune and check what you have said; exchange information, cross-check what you have said.  And if we realise that you told the truth -- that you lied, then that will be the opportunity to correct.  But if you refuse to correct, then you go back to prison." 

Meanwhile, Ibuka met to say what they know on each freed detainee.  So Ibuka had to give a statement on each prisoner who was released and they had to give a copy of the testimony of those who have confessed to their crimes to check if that tallies with what Ibuka wants -- or, if that tallies with what the judicial authorities -- or, more specifically what the prosecutor's office wanted.  This process lasted about three months prior to the release.  And it was during that period that people adjusted their testimonies, their statements. 

One day towards the end, the representatives of the office of the prosecutor, about six of them, came with a list -- a list of several persons.  It was virtually a copy of the gazette because the office of the prosecutor near the -- every year comes out with a list, and a list which depended on the -- on the whims of the prosecutor.  And sometimes it was really funny.  You can have somebody on that list today and he is removed tomorrow and appointed a minister or appointed a bourgmestre. 

So this was the flimsy list that they had, and they decided to group the people by commune.  They brought this list, and said, "This person," they would ask you, "is this person from your commune?" "Yes, he is the master among those who planned."  And this is how, within the camp, we carried out the fabrication of evidence to support the accusation of the former opinion leaders and officials. 
Q.	And can you tell us who is Ibuga? 
A.	It is "Ibuka" not "Ibuga".  Ibuka is an association of survivors of genocide.  It's an association that is well known in the country.  It is the only association of genocide survivors in Rwanda.  Thank you. 
Q.	While you were at the solidarity camp, were you approached by someone from the office of the ICTR? 
A.	Yes.  I was contacted by a woman.  Unfortunately, I cannot remember her name.  There were three of them.  And on that occasion they talked about **********************.  But I was called by that woman and she asked me if I could bring accusations against Dr. Casimir Bizimungu, and if I could speak to her to bring charges against Casimir Bizimungu.  I said, "No, I cannot speak to you madam, because I have already been contacted by the Defence."  She immediately withdrew and said that, "I am sorry.  I did not know that you had already been contacted by Casimir Bizimungu's Defence team."  So she withdrew.  So I do not even get to know her name.  It was a simple contact, and that stopped there. Thank you.
Q.	And what is the commune origin of Casimir Bizimungu; what commune was -- did he come from? 
A.	We are from the same commune, Nyamugali. 
Q.	Now, you told us you were released from the solidarity camp in May of 2003; when did you leave Rwanda? 
A.	I was released on the 5th of May 2003.  I left Rwanda on the 17th March 2005.  So, I've spent some two years in Rwanda working and engaging myself in useful activities.  Thank you. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Rukundo. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I have completed my direct examination.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any examination -- 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, Édouard Kremera's team has no questions for the witness. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, Mathieu Ngirumpaste's team has no questions either for this witness.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Mr. Witness, you now have to respond to the Prosecutor who now has an opportunity to cross-examine you.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, can I ask as to the time taken? 
MR. KOUAMBO: 
Fifty-five minutes, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, at this time we do have a substantial bundle of materials that I would like to distribute to the parties.  We have it here. 

The cross-examination of this witness is actually going to be conducted by my associate, Arif Virani, but I'm wondering if it would not be appropriate to take the morning break now so I could discuss the scope of this witness's testimony with my associate and it may result in us reducing the scope of our inquiry.  So, it is something the Court could consider, and I suggest that it is a good idea.  But, we leave it, of course, to the Court's discretion.  We are prepared to go forward, but my suggestion is that a more efficient cross-examination could result if I had a few minutes to consult with my associate and if we could distribute the bundles right now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can accept your application. 

Mr. Witness, we normally take a 15 minute recess at mid-morning.  And we'll take it now. 
MR. WEBSTER:
And I'll ask Mr. Issa to assist us in distributing the bundle so that the Defence can look at it during the break. 
(Court recessed from 1005H to 1022H)
MR. VIRANI: 
Good morning, Your Honour. 

Just by way of preparatory comment, Mr. Robinson's original estimation for this witness included two hours of direct examination.  I've prepared two hours of cross-examination.  I wanted to know if now may be an appropriate time to apply for the full two hours or would you like to wait and see how it proceeds after the end of 55 minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's wait and see how things go. 
MR. VIRANI: 
Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  Also, on Monday I communicated revised estimates of my (sic) cross-examination for this week's witnesses to the parties, and my estimate for this witness was 45 minutes.  Thank you.

MR. VIRANI: 
That is correct, Your Honour.  But to have the last word, my preparation was done two weeks earlier. 

Your Honour, getting ready to start.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. VIRANI: 
Q.	Mr. Witness, my name is Arif Virani.  I am an attorney with the Prosecution office.  I will be cross-examining you today.  Good morning. 

Witness, you spent a total of 6.5 years incarcerated in Rwanda, between the 16th of December and the 5th of May 2003; is that correct? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  I should make it clear that the six and a half years included the time that we spent at the solidarity camp.  So if you include that period, then the time would be six and a half years.  Thank you.
Q.	And you were detained in several different locations.  And what I want to do is clarify the record.  You were first arrested and held in a cell in Nyamugali commune for a few weeks; correct? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel.  That was the procedures.  I was arrested by the police and they detained me in their detention centre.  After that they transferred me, because the warrant of arrest had been prepared by the public prosecution department in Ruhengeri.  So they had to take me to the judiciary, that is, the deputy prosecutor who had framed the warrant of arrest. 

So two weeks -- two -- two weeks later I was taken -- no, rather, three weeks, because from the 16th of December up until the 7th of January.  So I was taken before the judiciary authority that had prepared the warrant of arrest in Ruhengeri.  So, they held me in the detention centre of the gendarmerie, that is, the brigade, after which I was taken to the Ruhengeri central prison.  I think it is clear. 
Q.	Witness, it was clear after your answer "yes".  So, please, if you could be brief in cross-examination. We are operating under time constraints. 

So we're now at the Ruhengeri central prison.  After some weeks, you indicated June 21st  -- January 21st, 1997, and you entered the general prison population; then you were moved to isolation. And in isolation you spent three years in isolation; is that correct? 
A.	That's correct.  No, about four months.  That was from January ending up until May; that is, February, March, April and part of May. 
Q.	Witness, I'm asking you about the time you were separated with 36 other individuals in Ruhengeri central prison; you were separated from the general population and you were moved to isolation.  And I put it to you you were separated for three years; correct? 
A.	I haven't followed the translation.  No, that's not correct.  We were isolated in the second semester of 1998 up until 1999 ending.  So that would be virtually a year and some months.  But that can be ascertained.  I don't have a diary with me and I did not have a diary with me while I was in prison. 
Q.	Witness, you testified in this Tribunal in the ********************************************************** and you took an oath in that case.  And you swore to tell the truth and you told the truth to the best of your knowledge; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
MR. VIRANI: 
We're just going to hand the witness document TW3 in my bundle.  The English version is TW1. 

Issa, if you could please come and receive the document from Don Webster? 
BY MR. VIRANI: 
Q.	Witness, if you could turn your attention to page -- 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I can't read this document because the characters are too fine.  I think I have problems with my sight and I'm unable to read the document.  The characters are too small. 
Q.	That is fine, Witness.  I will read it to you and your counsel will intervene if I have misread it or read it incorrectly. 
MR. VIRANI: 
Mr. Robinson, I am at the bottom of page 47 in the English version and I'm on page 51 in the French version. 
BY MR. VIRANI: 
Q.	And, Mr. Witness, there in *********************** you were testifying and the question is put to you with respect to the duration of the isolation and your response -- and I'm quoting, the middle of the page, page 47 -- "And this procedure remained in place for about tree years." 

At the bottom of that page 47 you say again, "So following that separation or isolation for about three years we were, again, given the right to be visited by our families."

Now, Witness, having read -- having heard your testimony from last year, do you agree with my proposition:  Were you under oath to tell the truth that your isolation was for three years? 
A.	I apologise, Mr. Prosecutor, but you can't challenge me with this document because there are often errors in the transcription.  If the idea is to verify the dates, I will put the time we were isolated as being between 1988 and 1999, and I will explain how we came out of isolation.  Now, the idea is interpretation.  Why did they put three years?  We came out of isolation when a new prosecutor general was appointed to replace Karugarama.  Now, how was this new prosecutor general appointed?  That is, when Karugarama was transferred to Kigali to serve as the adviser in the court of appeal.  We should not speculate with dates, when the reality is there. Thank you.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  We'll leave it to the gentlemen facing you, the Judges, to ascertain the veracity of the transcript. 

You indicated as well that you were sent to Gisenyi prison for six months and that was because you were accused of intimidating the prisoners in the general population; correct? 
A.	That is not correct.  I was transferred to Gisenyi for the political reasons that I explained.  It's not because I intimidated. 

The prison authorities -- the judicial authorities had their own policies.  And because we did not want to be part of those policies we were labelled as intimidators.  So we were not intimidators.  So I was transferred to Gisenyi because I expressed myself freely.  This was following a question that I put to the prosecutor when he came for a meeting.  I asked him this question:  "Let me be very clear.  Do you allow me to be very clear on this issue for the transfer to Gisenyi? " 
Q.	I have your answer, sir.  You are a lawyer and I am a lawyer.  I am asking you close questions; I am putting propositions to you.  I want you to answer briefly and to the point.  You've indicated that you were sent to Gisenyi and, if I understand you correctly, the label that was put on you is that you were intimidators.  That's the label that the prison authorities put on you; is that correct? 
A.	Unfairly, unfairly.  That is what I need to clarify. 
Q.	Finally, you returned to the general prison and you were sent to the solidarity camp for a period of three months, from end of January 2003 to the 5th of May 2003; that's correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Now, Witness, you and I will differ on the mathematics, but on my count since you were isolated for three years you spent a total of three years and 10 months separated from the general population in Ruhengeri general prison; three years in isolation; one month at different cells prior to the getting to the general prison; six months in Gisenyi; and three months at the solidarity camp; is that correct? 
A.	That is not the case, Counsel. 

I explained that we did not explain -- we did not spend three months, and if that's how they transcribed it then it was a typographical error.  I was not in isolation for three months.  And in the solidarity camp it's not an isolation.  We were detainees who had been released.  We could communicate freely. 

In Gisenyi, of course, I was separated from the Ruhengeri group. 
Q.	Witness, even if I assumed your mathematics are correct, which I did not, if you were isolated for one and a half years, and if you were together with everyone at solidarity camp, it still puts you over two years and one month separated from the Ruhengeri central prison.  So when you said in chief, 30 minutes ago to Mr. Robinson, that you spent with **************** virtually six years together, you were stating an untruth, weren't you? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Say that -- I spent six and a half years is the detention period.  On each occasion that I was detained in Gisenyi it was with ************** -- in the solidarity camp it was with *********.  During the isolation I was physically not with *********** but we were in the same prison.  So if I say that I've known ********** and that we spent the detention period together, there, again, I think it is an issue, it is speculation. 
Q.	I agree, counsel.  I think the speculation is on your part not on mine.  ********************** was not with you when you were in Gisenyi; correct? 
A.	When I said that I was with *********** the question was put to me, "Do you know *********?"  "I know him perfectly.  We spent our prison period together."

Now, if you remove the period during which I was in Gisenyi, well, fine.  But that does not take away the fact that I perfectly know ***********  The idea behind that is whether I knew ********** or not.  It's not the idea that we spent six years  -- or, the question behind the question was -- when the question was put to me -- is whether I knew ************  I know him perfectly.  The number of years we spent together, that's -- we were separated by events, I don't think it detracts from the question that was put to me as to whether I know **************.  Thank you.
Q.	Witness, I put it to you that you have very little first-hand knowledge about the fabrication of evidence by many prisoners at Ruhengeri central prison.  And, in fact, when you were questioned about this in another trial where you testified, which is the ************, you actually admitted that you had no direct knowledge about a number of the fabrication stories; is that correct? 
A.	That is not correct, Counsel. 
MR. VIRANI: 
I'm going to turn my bundle to R5A and R1.  And Mr. Webster will provide that document to the witness. 
BY MR. VIRANI: 
Q.	It's the same font.  I apologise, sir.  But I will lead you through the document.  I apologise if it is too small. 
MR. VIRANI: 
For my Anglophone colleagues I'm on pages 81 to 84 of the English transcript, which is tab R1.  And for my French colleagues, I'm pages 92 and 93 of tab R5A. 
BY MR. VIRANI: 
Q.	Witness, in this case and in this instance that I'm going to read to you, you are not actually even being cross-examined by counsel.  You are being cross-examined by the President of the Bench, Judge Møse.  And what he says to you -- and I'm reading from the top of page 81, in English.  "What is your basis for saying that this number 3 provided false testimony against **************?" 

And number 3 on your list, in that case, was an individual who you identified -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Your Honour, can counsel read slowly for the interpretation, please? 
MR. VIRANI: 
It is the same problem as last time, Your Honour.  I apologise, and also to the court reporter.

And for the clarity of the record, Your Honour, number 3 comes from the list which is Exhibit D. 136 in Setako, which has been disclosed with these transcripts.  And number 3 on that list is the individual named ***********. 
BY MR. VIRANI: 
Q.	And your response, Witness, was:  "Mr. President, I pointed out that all the information reached me through number 2.  He frequently told me what was happening.  These were friends and he was the coordinator of the camp, and we shared everything, all information.  And that is how I learned that number 2 had -- that number 3 had made false testimony against Mr. Setako." 
MR. VIRANI: 
Number 2 on the list, Your Honour, and for the witness, is **************************. 
BY MR. VIRANI:
Q.	Now I'm going to take you to two more passages, Witness.  On the right side of the same page, in English, at the top on page 82, Judge Møse asks you:  "Again, what is your basis for saying that number 4 falsely incriminated Colonel Setako?"

And number 4 on your list was *************.  And your response was quote, "The same answer holds. That is, I got my information from number 2, **************."

And just to complete the referencing.  At the top of page 83 on the left side, Judge Møse asked you: "Once again, trying to ascertain the source of your information, is the answer the same when it comes to Mr. Ntigirumwe?  No implication from you in prison or solidarity camp but your basis for saying that this person falsely incriminated Mr. Setako is information conveyed by number 2.  Is it the same picture also in relation to this number 5?"

Number 5 on your list was Nryanabamzi, N-R-Y-A-N-A-B-A-M-Z-I.

And your response:  "Yes, Mr. President, it is the same."

Mr. Uwurukundo, I put it to you that you testified under oath before a presiding judge of this Chamber, that you had no information personally about the fabrication of evidence regarding these three individuals, and all of your information came from ********************; correct? 
A.	Counsel, that is not correct.  Let me clarify for the Bench and for counsel for the Prosecution.  That fabrication of testimony or evidence was done in several stages.  The stage at which I was an eyewitness was that stage during which I was in prison, prior to my transfer to Gisenyi, because to transfer me to Gisenyi was intended to accelerate the process. 

When I got from Gisenyi, and particularly in the solidarity camp, all these questions were put to me on how I got to know that Setako had been falsely accused.  And I said it was at the solidarity camp I had taken a distance, I had withdrawn from the process, because I was already in the process of being released and I didn't want to risk having -- I didn't want to risk being sent back to prison, because people had been sent back to prison even from the solidarity camp.  But I had information on ***************  I was his ********at the camp in terms of organisation.  He was the ******* and I was his ***************** 

So all these persons, *****************, had changed their procedure.  When they were in prison they had drafted their statements.  When they got to the solidarity camp, they revised their statement and included new people in their statements, including Setako.  I had documents.  He even showed me documents.  When I went to Gisenyi in the month of September -- 
Q.	I have your answer, thank you.  Okay. 

Witness, while you were in Gisenyi for six months and while you were in isolation for 1.5 years, or three years as you testified earlier, did you have any means of communicating with ************ or anyone else about their fabrication?  Were you e-mailing them, calling them on a cell phone perhaps, writing them letters? 
A.	No.  No, when you are in isolation you cannot communicate with them.  When I was in Gisenyi I could not communicate with them.  But when I got out of isolation I communicated with them.  When I came back from Gisenyi I communicated easily with them.  They informed -- they updated me on the process.  Thank you.
Q.	Witness, I want to ask you about the account you gave in your evidence-in-chief regarding the fabrication by *************************. 

Now, I will pass up a document to the witness. 
MR. VIRANI: 
For the benefit of my friends we are going to look at the documents W1 and W5, in French. 
BY MR. VIRANI: 
Q.	Now, Witness, the font is the same, so I'm going to read the portion.  And, again, Mr. Robinson can object if I have adapted it in any way or have been untrue to the content. 

Now, you said in chief that ************** was talking to you about the fabrication of evidence in 1998. And that is when he came and spoke to you prior to you being sent into isolation. 
A.	Correct.  That is 1999; 1999 not 1998. 
Q.	You can correct that now, but I believe your testimony was 1998, prior to your separation.  But, in any event, I want to take you to a portion of the transcript, page 54, and this is your testimony in ******************.  And what you say refers to the exact same incident you are recalling. 
MR. VIRANI: 
And I'm on the bottom of the page, Mr. Robinson.  I'm on the bottom of page 54, in the English.
BY MR. VIRANI: 
Q.	Witness, now in the scenario they outlined these are your words:  "They wanted to say that Nzirorera, the minister, came by helicopter from Kigali and that he landed in Mukingo at his residence, travelling by helicopter, and that he brought some fuel and other things.  And that from there he held the first meeting in order to give orders and guidelines as to what people were to do in order to put into play the genocide and execute the Tutsis in the region.  So when he outlined the scenario to me" he is referring to **************, "I said this would not hold water in the sense that he would be up against the civilian population during Gacaca proceedings."

And a few words later you say:  "And how would one explain how a helicopter landed in a region with all that this represented and that he came alone without any of his friends?  So I said, 'Well, you know your scenario will not hold water, and you really need to tell things that are realistic.'"

And if you move down the page, Witness, in the middle of the right side, the right column.  At page 55, you said:  "Unfortunately, during this period of discussion, that was when the decision fell to transfer me to Gisenyi.  So that was in the month of June of the year 2002.  I only heard the other details when I went to solidarity camp.  I left Gisenyi a week before I appeared before the members of  population.  I left Gisenyi.  I went to Ruhengeri for a week and then I appeared before members of the population. And as to the rest, well, I learned about it in Byumba solidarity camp."

So, Witness, I put it to you that whether it is 1998, as you said in evidence-in-chief, or whether it is 1999, which you told to me three minutes ago, your recollection is incorrect because any discussions about pleas -- discussions with ************** -- actually occurred in 2002, according to your testimony under oath in Ndindiliyimana; am I correct? 
A.	It is not true, Counsel.  Once again, let me point out that this document cannot be opposed to me, because there are inaccuracies.  Maybe you should bring the recording.  That is what we can use as the basis of discussion.  What is transcribed, there are mistakes in the transcription. 

I described this stage by stage when I met *********, the various stages of the fabrication of evidence.  So, I don't know.  For as long as I don't see this document and compare it with the recording I cannot make any pronouncement on this. 
Q.	Witness, I put it to you further that this goes much further than helping to draft confessions or legal advice.  What you were doing when you spoke to ********* is you were influencing the process. You were helping prisoners to tell plausible or believable stories and you were impeding the search for the truth.  The truth was not salient to you; believability was salient; am I correct?
A.	That is not true, Counsel.  What I said was that all detainees who wanted to confess had to tell the truth and nothing but the truth, because I pointed out to them that once they get into the Gacaca proceedings, their fabrication will not stand the test. 

When they come here to Arusha they can tell you anything.  But before the population they cannot say just anything.  So I told them, "Tell the truth.  If you don't want to tell the truth, that is your problem.  You are going have problems when you come before the Gacaca proceedings."  Thank you. 
Q.	Witness, I put it to you that this type of intervention with ********** is exactly the reason why you were separated as an intimidator; is that correct? 
A.	That is not correct, Counsel.  I have clearly demonstrated that I was a victim of political manipulation, because to be an intimidator you have to produce certain facts that you prevented A, B or C from confessing.  Nobody complained to the director of prisons.  Now you take somebody because you have some presumptions on him.  The proof is that after my transfer things remained the way they are. 
MR. VIRANI: 
I'm going to put before the witness document A17, which is the last page of Exhibit D. NZ136. 

Mr. Webster will hand it to Issa.
BY MR. VIRANI: 
Q.	On the right side of that page there is a list of 47 names.  The tenth name on that list is an individual who you have discussed already in your examination-in-chief.  And it's an individual who testified in this case under the pseudonym (By order of the Court, this name was extracted and kept under separate cover). 
A.	So, what's your question, Counsel? 
Q.	I was awaiting the translation. 

The question is as follows, Witness:  In that individual's testimony -- number 10 on this list, he returned twice to this Chamber -- and in his recantation testimony in April of 2008 when he returned to tell the truth to this Chamber, he didn't even acknowledge your involvement in his guilty plea; that's correct, isn't it? 
A.	I don't know if the question was put clearly, but I believe that if he came here he would not say no. Before me, he would not say no.  Was the question put pointedly to know whether he collaborated with me or not?  If he said no, then he's a liar.  I challenge him to come here for a confrontation. Thank you.
Q.	What's clear, Witness, and I'll take you to the documents, is that one of you is not telling the truth. We're here to find out which one. 
MR. VIRANI: 
If we can put the documents A4 and A2 before the witness, please? 

For my English colleagues, we'll be looking at A1 and A3, starting with A3. 

And, Mr. Robinson, I'm reading.  This may be more legible to the witness because I believe it is not in as fine a font. 
BY MR. VIRANI:
Q.	Witness, I'm in the French copy.  I'm on page 64.  And the citation is marked for your assistance. 

And you said -- I'm sorry. 

The witness who returned for his second testimony said, "I believe that when testifying before this Tribunal I said that I was the one to draft my confession.  However," and here he is clarifying the record.  And He said, quote "It was somebody else by the name of Alphonse Bagina who drafted my confession.  He was a detainee who had resorted to the confession and guilty plea procedure himself. And he was part of the group of detainees who was helping other detainees to draft their confessions. He was someone who knew the legal field all too well.  I told him everything as to the others, and he said what he knew about the detainees here.  He then went to write down my confession, I appended my signature to the document and it was transmitted to the director."

So in the context of clarifying who helped him with his confession and returning here to tell the truth on a recant, there is no mention of you, Witness.  Do you still stand by the fact that this witness is lying and you are not? 
(Pages 11 to 24 by Eleanor Bastian)







1100H 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Counsel.  I don't know which period he is referring to.  But as I told you, it was not a matter of drafting for him.  It was a matter of writing correctly.  And it was Alphonse.  I did not know him.  I never knew him.  Maybe he came to the prison when I was in Gisenyi, reason for which I could not draft ******************testimony when I was in Gisenyi.  

But if he is able to say no to the various contacts that we had, particularly, in respect of fabrication of evidence against Nzirorera, how would I have known?  Look through the documents that you have in the Tribunal.  You will find ***********statement referring to *************landing on the 7th.  How did I get to know this?  

Now, if Alphonse drafted the testimony while I was in Gisenyi, that is his right.  Was a question put specifically to him:  "Did you know **************?  Did you at some point in time during the drafting collaborate?"  Would he be able to say no?  Was a question put to him directly?  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
There's a problem that has developed, and it's not anybody's particular fault.  But there is a linkage of a name and an acronym, which we need to correct for the protection of a protected witness.  I'm not certain exactly -- 

Do you understand what I'm getting at?  
MR. VIRANI:
Yes, Your Honour.  If we could excise the acronym from the record and keep that under seal, please.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  I think that might be --

Mr. Robinson? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I make the order for putting the acronym under seal. 
BY MR. VIRANI:
Q.	Witness, I again would remind you to please keep your answers brief.  

Now, your testimony in chief this morning was that this discussion with *********** occurred in 1998.  Your testimony 15 minutes ago was that occurred in 1999.  However, I want to show you portions of the same transcript which indicate when this witness said the discussions about pleading guilty occurred.  
MR. VIRANI:
And for my English friends, I'm on page 50, at the top of the page, still with document A3.  
BY MR. VIRANI:
Q.	For the witness I'm at page 60 in the French version, at the top left, and the portion is marked for you.  And this is the question to the witness who is identified at number 10 on the list of -- on the piece of paper in front of you in D. NZ136.  

And the question was:  "When you did you arrive in Ruhengeri prison?"  And the response was:  "It was on the 20th of April 1995."  
MR. VIRANI:
And if you flip the page in the English to page 51, at the bottom.
BY MR. VIRANI:
Q.	And, Witness, that is page 62 in the French.

Here the questioning continues by the -- the examiner.  Actually, I'm referring to the Ruhengeri prosecutor.  
MR. VIRANI:
I'm at the bottom of page 51, Mr. Robinson. 
BY MR. VIRANI:
Q.	"The staff member of the Ruhengeri prosecutor who first conveyed to you the message that you should accuse authorities from your region -- how long had you been in detention before that message was delivered to you by that staff member?  His response, "I had been in Ruhengeri prison for a long time.  I had spent about six years in that prison."  

Six plus 1995 is 2001, Witness.  So this individual is indicating his first contact, his first discussions with the Ruhengeri prosecutors about potentially pleading guilty and confessing, dates to 2001, not 1999, not 1998.  Is this witness correct in his testimony, or is he lying again?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  If you say the first contact with the prosecutor goes back to 2001, probably he's talking about official contact.  But there were unofficial contacts.  Now, a person was summoned to go to the public prosecution department, and he will go there without any records being kept.  He will just go there with his ideas.  Probably he was afraid of saying, because he couldn't prove it.  

But what I know is that the contacts were there and had been there since 1998, and they cannot deny the fact that the prosecutor general in the Ruhengeri court of appeal came to the prison in 1998 and that he decided to isolate us in order to speed up the process of fabricating testimonies.  So his statements can bound only him.  So if he think -- can bind only him.  So if he thinks he met the Prosecutor only in 2001, that's up to him.  
Now, I can prove this if I can be taken to Ruhengeri, or, if we have access to his entire case file, I will prove that he met the Prosecutor even before the year 2001.  Thank you.  
Q.	Witness, let's move to this discussion by the -- Tharcisse Karugama (sic), which you alleges (sic) in 1998.  And what you said in chief is that -- and I've written it down verbatim -- you were told you could be released, "On condition that you confessed and accuse the political, religious, military, and businessmen leaders."  And you also said, "It was a prerequisite."

What you were saying is quite serious, Mr. Witness.  You're testifying that one of the senior legal officials in Ruhengeri, indeed a man who is now the minister of justice, encouraged prisoners to lie; is that correct?  Is that your testimony?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  I would like to point out, first of all, that the message was addressed to detainees who had to make confessions and who were to be released, because, first of all, I was put in the first category.  If I had perpetrated genocide, I wouldn't -- well, because it was clearly stated that they wanted to release farmers.  I wasn't a farmer.  Now, if he said that in order for the farmers -- the peasants to be released, their prerequisite was to denounce authorities who caused them to perpetrate genocide.  Well, if you call that lies, I don't know.  

The truth is there, because there are persons who even acknowledged offences that they did not commit.  I mean, the truth is there.  You can go to the field, to the ground.  The facts are there.  The people are there.  There are people who acknowledged that they participated in attacks but did not kill.  So they arranged themselves in order to put themselves, you know -- to put themselves amongst a group of, you know, evil-doers. 
A.	So there are people who went and confessed to things that they did not do.  For instance, what about the Gato -- for instance, who said that they went to Nyakinama.  I mean, you have this in records.  

Should I -- let me continue with my answer.  In order to -- once they were contacted to bring charges against priests, for instance, they came and asked me whether I could help them to bring charges against priests.  I said no.  
Q.	Please stop.  The question I asked you was whether the attorney general was encouraging prisoners to lie.  You have said that if prisoners made up stories after the fact, then the truth is there for people to see.  

What I want to put to you is that when you encourage fabrication of evidence, that's serious and that's unlawful, and the attorney general would have known it was unlawful; correct?  
A.	Yes.  Of course, he -- he did that deliberately.  And he knew.  What do you want me to do?  In politics there's no justice.  When politics come before justice, you see, I mean, things become disastrous.  He was a politician.  So he didn't work along the lines of a jurist. 
Q.	So I put to you, Witness, that when you're making such a suggestion, you would be careful when you made it.  Is that fair? 
A.	What I'm saying, that from the look of what was happening, it -- it wasn't justice that was being put into play.  It was more politics, because politics was given pride of place over justice, and I will stop there. 
Q.	And I'd put it to you that politicians are actually a lot more careful than lawyers in my experience.  

But, Witness, my question is that -- you are testifying that even though he was making such a dramatic and unlawful suggestion he did it out in the open, in front of all of the prisoners and in front of his colleagues.  Is that your testimony?  
A.	What he stated, he stated in front of detainees and his colleagues.  So he has to draw the consequences, or you can make the inference. 
Q.	Witness, I put it to you that, in fact, what the attorney general of the appeals court was doing with his colleagues wasn't illegal at all.  They were informing the prisoners about their options under the law, including the option of pleading guilty.  They weren't procuring false testimony.  Do you agree? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, all information tends to indicate that, even if he is not the one who directly went to the field, I'm telling you that I know of cases of detainees who went on to make confessions, but because they did not want to include this official or that, their confessions were rejected.  So on the basis of what can you deny or reject the confession of a person because he did not name this person or that?  Especially, if the person was not there, if the person was not in the country.  

There's a certain Jacques (sic) Népomuscène who did not want to put Rucagu's name in his confession.  He didn't want to put Révérien's name in his confession.  His confession was rejected.  And that young man was convicted.  In 1994 he was not in the commune.  
Q.	I'm not asking about Jean Népomuscène.  I asked you a question.  I want a yes or no answer.  The attorney general and his officials were not procuring false testimony; is that correct or not? 
A.	They wanted to procure false testimonies.  My answer is in the affirmative. 
Q.	Witness, you've testified in chief that there were a new law in Rwanda and the law had certain advantages for pleading guilty.  Do you agree with me that it is the duty of government officials to raise awareness about legislation? 
A.	Yes.  Indeed it is the responsibility of any official to raise people's awareness, but there are limits to that.  When you raise awareness and you go as far as forcing somebody, that is going beyond raising awareness, and that's where the difference is.  

First of all, you have the right to raise awareness, but the fact is that people went well beyond just raising awareness.  So there were excesses.  Thank you. 
Q.	And, Witness, we're both lawyers.  We don't need to get into too much detail.  But you agree that there was a law in 1996 called the organic law? 
A.	I know that law. 
Q.	There was a later law passed in 2001 that dealt with applying Gacaca jurisdiction to people who were involved in the genocide? 
A.	Yes indeed. 
Q.	And you agree with me that the advantages under the 2001 Gacaca law were much greater than under the 1996 law; is that correct?  The advantages for the prisoners.  
A.	Well, it was along the same lines of releasing as many detainees as possible, that is, the persons that were seen as not having perpetrated the genocide deliberately but that they were -- merely executed the plans made by others and they were not aware of what they were doing. 
Q.	So you would agree with me that the real focus on confessions and guilty pleas started after the enactment of the Gacaca law in 2001; correct? 
A.	Well, that is the sequence of the events. 
Q.	Witness, I want to talk about other incentives for pleading guilty.  You indicated, in your evidence in chief, that when people pled guilty, they were offered release, they were given visiting privileges.  Some prisoners, however, got privileges before they ever pled guilty, didn't they? 
A.	Not at all.  I know of no prisoners who had such benefits before having made confessions. 
Q.	************** pled guilty for the first time in 2002.  Do you agree? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I don't agree with that.  Probably the -- the file was finalised in 2002 while I was in Gisenyi.  But the various stages that culminated in the finalisation of all of it was in -- probably in 2002.  But I think the initial confessions were 1999.  I think it (sic) kept reviewing his draft.  And probably the final document was entered in 2002.  But he revused -- or, revised his statement, his confession statement, several times. 
Q.	Witness, we're under some time constraints.  There are two documents I have in this court right now that demonstrated he testified formally -- he confessed formally and finalised his confession in 2002.  Do you agree or disagree? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, that is just -- what I just explained.  He formalised or finalised his document in 2002 probably.  And even in the solidarity camp -- well, I don't have the document with me.  But he showed me another document that was dated April 2003.  Now, so what do you think is actually the final document?  So he kept revising his statements even in the solidarity camp.  

Now, if I go to the Gacaca -- if you go -- if you go to Mukingo, I think I can find various copies of his statements.  So if an -- when did he finalise his document?  I said in 1998 he already started making drafts of his statements, in which he included Nzirorera.  Now, I -- then later he started saying that Nzirorera took place in -- sense -- in raising awareness and in sensitising and training Interahamwe.  So his statements kept, you know, evolving, and he had to adjust them, modifying the contents thereof right even up to 2003. 
Q.	So, Witness, we're in agreement that it was in 2002 that he finalised his guilty plea.  However, I put it to you that he was made chef de sécurité of the Ruhengeri central prison in 1999, 2000.  That's correct, isn't it? 
A.	That he was the brigadier general of the detainees.  But in 2001, 2002, 2000 and -- up to 2003, he left the position of brigadier general to be captaine général.  It was a promotion, because he had helped those he had to assist.  So, Mr. Prosecutor, I don't know what you are heading at, but the truth is there. 
Q.	He starts as chef de sécurité in 1999, and he ends up as the captaine around --
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	-- 2002.  Yes.  Do we agree? 
A.	Up to his time of release. 
Q.	And other prisoners, Mr. Witness, got advantages in prison without ever having pled guilty.  You're an example of that, aren't you?  
A.	I wasn't going to make confessions.  I was given the possibility of coordinating the PRI project, 
	first of all, because I had the skills, and then they knew the truth.  I had left the commune in 1992.  1992.  And the genocide actually started in 1994.  So they knew my personality, and they were aware that I was innocent.  They knew that.  So they made it possible for me to leave and to manage those detainees that were involved in the PRI project.  So it wasn't a favour.  They knew what I had. 
Q.	Witness, I'm just refreshing your memory.  In chief you indicated that at Ruhengeri central prison, (By order of the Court, this name was extracted and kept under separate cover) had a -- a -- a privileged role -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could we redact the acronym, please. 
MR. VIRANI:
My apologise -- my apologies, Your Honour. 
BY MR. VIRANI:
Q.	At Ruhengeri central prison, in your evidence in chief, when questioned by Mr. Robinson, you indicated that you assisted the individual identified as number 10 on the document D. NZ136.  You helped coordinate the works funded by the European Union and that later on at the solidarity camp, the same person was in charge of the detainees, and you were his deputy.  That's correct, isn't it?  You just told us that.  
A.	I was his deputy.  And he had his -- the areas where he had to focus.  For instance, on the programme of confessions, he was in charge of that while I was organising the camp and how the detainees could organise themselves, et cetera.  But he was responsible -- well, I was his deputy in order to assist him so that he could be free to take -- to -- charge of confessions.  I was his deputy.  But we worked as, you know, in a collegiate (sic) manner, not that he was an authority over me and so could exercise some kind of authority over me.  We worked, you know, as -- as peers, as it were. 
Q.	Witness, not only did you receive these advantages in terms of your position in the facilities, but you were also released, weren't you, without ever agreeing to fabricate and without ever pleading guilty? 
A.	That is correct.  They tried to steer me towards that end, but I said no.  My conscience wouldn't be clear.  They asked me to make charges against -- to bring charges against a priest.  I said no.  I -- I refused.
MR. KOUAMBO:
Mr. President, just to say that time is over, just for the information of the Bench.  Thank you, Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if I could just say that I don't object to his continuing.  I think he's (sic) been a productive cross-examination and a focused one, so I think he's earned the time, as far as I am concerned. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Robinson. 

Do you have an idea of how much more time you would need?  
MR. VIRANI:
Approximately 45 minutes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, that's -- let's proceed. 
MR. VIRANI:
Thank you very much, Your Honour. 

Thank you, Mr. Robinson. 
BY MR. VIRANI:
Q.	Witness, you also indicated in your evidence in chief that while at the solidarity camp you were approached by someone from the Office of the Prosecutor at this Tribunal but you turned that woman down because you were already in contact with -- from -- by Defence counsel in the case of Bizimungu.  That was your evidence; correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	So even though the Rwandan prosecutor's office knew that you were potentially coming to this city to testify on behalf of the Defence, they still released you in May of 2003, didn't they? 
A.	I don't think that they were aware that I was going to appear here, because they were not supposed to know everything about me, unless probably the Office of the Prosecutor had informed them or had informed Gahima, Gérard or any other judicial authority that I was going to appear here.  Certainly, they wouldn't have released me, or probably I would have had other forms of constraint. 
Q.	Witness, you testified in chief that one of the reasons why you were isolated was so that the peasants or farmers, as you called them, would have the confidence to accuse leaders such as yourself.  But none of them ever did, did they? 
A.	That is all they did.  And others refused, like the case of Népomuscène that I mentioned.  He refused to bring charges against me and he -- his confession was denied.  And so now he's been given life even though it was a death sentence that was earlier given to him because -- for having refused to mention Valerian's (sic) name in his confession, his confession was rejected.  

Now, against which truth -- they can't even tell us -- now, this is the truth.  Now, we -- giving you the capital punishment -- because the truth is this.  So they don't want to accept what he confessed to.  

And what is the basis on which his confession was refused?  Did it have any counter-truth -- any truth that was contrary to his confession?  They couldn't produce it.  So there are some who went along 
the -- who adopted -- followed the policy of the public prosecution department while others refused to go along their lines. 
Q.	Witness, if the Rwandan prosecution authorities wanted you behind bars at all costs, I put it to you, it would have been more simple for them to just manufacture evidence against you, rather than searching for false accusers.  Do you agree? 
A.	When I was arrested, certainly there are people who were questioned and who accused me falsely.  Other persons who were questioned -- and they spoke to truth, because proceedings -- or, investigations are made, you know, by the defence and by the prosecution.  So there are people who accuse me falsely of having taken part in the genocide.  There are others who spoke the truth.  

And we put everything on balance -- well, the file was classified.  And in order to get the truth, they brought me before the population, and the population -- members of the population spoke the truth, and the consequence is that I was released.  So this was normal under the law and if truth is being sought.  Thank you. 
MR. VIRANI:
Mr. President, at this point in my cross-examination, I need to take the witness to a document that is under seal in this -- in this proceeding.  So I would actually make an application to proceed in closed session for the balance of my cross-examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You said for the balance of your -- your -- your -- the balance of your cross-examination needs to be in closed session. 
MR. VIRANI:
I believe so, Your Honour.  Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  

For the benefit of the public, the Chamber has from time to time made protection orders for security reasons in relation to particular witnesses before the Tribunal.  The line of -- and one element of that, of those orders, is that their identity should be concealed from the public.  

Counsel has indicated that the next phase of his examination is likely to reveal the identity of a protected witness.  And for that reason we have to go into closed session.  It should last approximately half an hour.  We go into closed session now.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 34 to 46] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 25 to 33 by Tanya West)




























MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  

Mr. Robinson, do you have any reply? 
MR. ROBINSON:
No, thank you, Mr. President.  But I do have a request that the witness be allowed to meet Mr. Nzirorera today.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  
MR. VIRANI:
Your Honour, if I may just ask the indulgence of the Court.  I wanted to review my notes, for the purposes of making an application for certain documents with respect to admission or identification, if I could do that first thing tomorrow morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Certainly.  
MR. VIRANI:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I presume that you'll also clarify the issue of whether there'll be an objection or not to facilitate the admissions.  
MR. VIRANI:
Yes, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  

Mr. Witness, this completes your testimony before the Tribunal.  And we thank you, as we do all witnesses, for assisting the Tribunal in its work.  You are now free and you are at liberty to leave.  

The registrar will make arrangements to facilitate the request made by Mr. Robinson.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
(Witness excused) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, are you ready for me to call my next witness?  Are you ready for me to call my next witness? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
The next witness known as Witness 16.  He's not been the beneficiary of any protective measures but he would like to request a protection.  And so I ask that we bring him in in a protected capacity and you can decide whether or not you want to grant him protective measures at the outset of his testimony.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Okay.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good afternoon, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you begin to testify, the Prosecutor will assist you to take an oath to tell the truth.  Sorry, not the Prosecutor, the registrar will assist you to take an oath to tell the truth. 
(Declaration made by Witness 16 in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, it's been reported to us that you wish to make an application for protection.  Is that true? 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you tell us very briefly why you're making this request.  
THE WITNESS: 
In brief, I would like to be considered a protected witness because I have concerns.  I would not like to give testimony in open court because the Rwandan police summoned me and I feel that if ever I were to testify in open court, I would subsequently face the consequences.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, do you wish to ask the witness any questions? 
MR. ROBINSON:
No, thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I have no questions, Your Honours.  It seems to me the witness's response meets the threshold that we've established in this trial, so I'll leave it to the Court's discretion. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, could you indicate when was it that you received the summons from the police.  
THE WITNESS: 
I can't remember the exact date, Mr. President, but this happened in the course of this year.  And there were many of us who received such summonses.  There were more than ten of us who received them.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you.  

We think that it would be appropriate to make the protection order in this case.  And the terms are the usual terms that we have been imposing in all cases in cases of this nature.  In particular, we will allow the witness to testify under the pseudonym number 16 and his identity will be concealed from the public.  

Now, you will begin your testimony now.  You'll have to respond to questions put to you by counsel for Nzirorera.  

Mr. Robinson, we have just about five minutes.  I don't know...  
MR. ROBINSON:
We can at least take care of the personal information sheet and then that should be enough.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you. 
WITNESS 16, 
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness 16, in front of you is a document that has your name and some personal information.  Can you check that and if it's correct can you sign that document.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  But I would like to be availed of a person who can assist me in the reading the contents of this personal information sheet because I can't read it myself.  
MR. ROBINSON:
In that case, Mr. President, we would have to actually go into closed session.  

I think it would probably be better if we take our adjournment now and let Mr. Issa read that document to him and then tomorrow morning when he comes it will all be taken care of, rather than taking up the time of the Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What language do you wish Mr. Issa to communicate with him in? 
MR. ROBINSON:
In Kinyarwanda, with the help of the interpreters.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, your expertise extends to that area?  
MR. MJUI: 
Thank you.  Your Honour, with the help of Kinyarwanda interpreter I'll do that.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  

Mr. Witness, we, for various reasons, we have to take our adjournment now.  And so we resume tomorrow morning at 8:45.  

We take our adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1224H)
