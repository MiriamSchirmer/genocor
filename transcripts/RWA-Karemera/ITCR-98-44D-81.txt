MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour. 

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Short, and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Friday the 
28th of October, 2005, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera, 
et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody. 

Mr. Robinson, we have decided to readjust our scheduling to make certain that you have your hour and a half.  So what we will do, we will permit you to complete your cross-examination after 11:15.  

And, Mr. Webster, we have also decided that we would give you time, just before we start the status conference, to complete your examination.  So we will try to ensure that you both have the hour and a half that we had committed to yesterday, so you may start now. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. WEBSTER:
You're saying the status conference will be held before or after?  I'm not --
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are scheduled that we would have our sessions finished by -- in order for us to keep an appointment at 12:30, and then by which time your cross-examination -- your re-examination ought to have been completed if we have kept to our schedule, and we are going to commence the status conference at 1:30.  So what we are proposing is that, to complete the hour and a half that we have committed you to have, you would complete that from 1:30, and then immediately after that we will move into the status conference. 
AHMED NAPOLÉON MBONYUNKIZA,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Mbonyunkiza.  
A.	Good morning, Mr. Robinson. 
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, this morning when I ask you a question and you start to give an answer that I think is too long, I'm going to put up my hand.  When I do that, that means stop, okay?  So, first of all, have you had the opportunity to watch the video of the speech of President Habyarimana at the meeting in Ruhengeri on the 15th of November 1992? 

Is there some problem in translation? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I believe the witness may not be on the right channel for him to have heard that question, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, can you hear me now?  

Mr. Robinson, perhaps you should repeat the question. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I will.  Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, did you have the chance to watch the video of President Habyarimana's speech at Ruhengeri on the 15th of November 1992? 
A.	Yes.  The Registrar showed me the video.  I was shown that video by the Registrar. 
Q.	Thank you.  And was that the same speech that you heard on the radio back in 1992? 
A.	No.  It was only a short clip of that speech, a very small part of that speech.  It's not the speech in its entirety. 
Q.	Now, when you testified earlier about the speech, and that was on the 22nd of September, you told us that it was your understanding President Habyarimana was saying he was going to come down with the Interahamwe to carry out killings.  Having reviewed the video, is that still your testimony? 
A.	I think you misunderstood me, possibly.  I'm telling you, and I shall repeat, last time I even explained by saying that when Habyarimana said he was going to come down or descend, he was speaking along the same lines as the speech of Sindikubwabo.  Sindikubwabo, himself, after the genocide, used that expression that people needed to go down to the ground.  He was addressing the authorities of the time.  He was asking them to leave their offices.  He said that now these authorities were dealing with other tasks.  What tasks was he referring to at that time?  So, to descend -- first of all, clothing the Interahamwe and descending, do you understand that expression, Counsel?  Eventually they descended.  They went down.  If you understand that to mean killings, that's your understanding or assessment.  But, in fact, it is true, because eventually the Interahamwe went down or descended and people were killed.  And they did this with President Sindikubwabo who inherited that from Habyarimana.  So I'm not changing what I had said.  Let me stop there because that's my position, my stand. 
Q.	Okay.  And is it not true that when President Habyarimana said that he was going to come down or descend with the Interahamwe, he said that that was to be done during his campaign for the election? 
A.	You had asked me to be brief in my responses, but I will, however, give explanations here.  Let's first of all look at the speech made by Sindikubwabo.  I remember it very well.  He said, "You must analyse what we're saying and try and understand what we want to say."  You are not Rwandan, I understand, Mr. Robinson.  Had you been a Rwandan, you would have quickly understood what was meant.  When he says, "I'm going to descend, accompanied by my Interahamwe," in fact, he even asked the national secretary, who was Mathieu Ngirumpatse, to ensure that this would come about.  So you need to have a link between the establishment of the Interahamwe and the authorities.  During that rally he said that he was asking the national secretary of the MRND to contact the businessmen and find the kitenge fabric in order to clothe the Interahamwe.  He went on to say that this kind of fabric suited them perfectly.  He even said that, even if this endeavour required large sums of money, that money had to be found.  That is a situation, Mr. Robinson.  It's not about a campaign.  There are procedures when campaign for an authority is involved.  In the same line of thought --  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much, Mr. Mbonyunkiza.  We are going to move now to the rally of the 23rd of October 1993 at which Frudad (sic) Karemera spoke of the Hutu power, and I put to you that neither Mr. Ngirumpatse, Mr. Karemera, or Mr. Nzirorera were present at that rally.  Do you have any information to the contrary? 
A.	I never lie, and I'm going to tell you that I'm not going to change my stand.  You mentioned only one date and that's a good thing.  The day Karemera mentioned the word "power" and other words, but at the original stadium I think we have seen here in this Court Mugenzi and his colleagues are in a photograph.  I want, therefore, to show you the link or relationship between these people and what I'm saying.  Please do not concentrate only on the date, on that single date. 

I didn't even say on the 22nd that these people were present.  I will say -- speaking about the period at the end of 1993, the period during which the concept of power was in vogue.  

Have you understood me, Mr. Robinson?  It's merely the heritage of the year of 1959 which was continuing, Mr. Robinson. 
Q.	Okay.  I understand you.  Now, moving to the events of April through July 1994, I would like to have you shown a copy of what we've been provided as the judgement or dosiér of your case.  Mr. Mbonyunkiza, before coming to Court today, have you had an opportunity to receive a copy of that? 
A.	If you had provided me with this copy earlier, I would have received it. 
Q.	I thought you testified that the Prosecutor had shown you or provided you a copy of this dosiér when you arrived in Arusha.  Am I wrong about that? 
A.	No.  There's no problem.  If you'd asked that question in that way, it would have been better.  You need to know how to put questions.  You have to ask whether the last time you had said that I had obtained that document.  This is making me waste time.  It is slowing down the proceedings. 
Q.	So, do you recognise the document that's before you? 
A.	Yes.  However, there are some sheets, for instance, this one here.  I don't recognise this one.  What I know was a handwritten document.  No -- as regards this particular sheet of paper, so maybe you shouldn't mix things up, because you're asking me if I've seen these documents and there are some documents in there which I have not recognised.  Maybe you have changed something in this set of documents you've given me. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'm going to offer at this time the Kinyarwandan version of the records of Mr. Mbonyunkiza's case as Exhibit D. NZ52A.  We have the excerpts that were requested to be translated into French, which I have here, which I will offer as D. NZ52B, and the English excerpts which I will offer as D. NZ52C. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ52A, D. NZ52B and D. NZ52C admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, do those documents contain reports of statements that you made during your trial? 
A.	Yes, that's correct. 
Q.	And during your trial, did you tell the Court that you had disassociated yourself from the MRND before the events of 1994? 
A.	That is true. 
Q.	Now, you were asked -- it's also true that you were interviewed in November of 1994 by a human rights investigator by the name of Lynne Goldberg (phonetic), correct? 
A.	Did you say November 1994?
Q.	Yes.
A.	Did you, indeed, say November 1994, Counsel?  You have to be very specific and precise with dates, because this might confuse me, because I do not recall that date.  I've met many people, and you need to inform me of which document you're referring to.  I don't want you to complicate my task by confusing me. 
Q.	I'm referring to a report of an interview with you on the 18th of November 1994 by a woman by the name of Lynne Goldberg with respect to the death of your older brother.  
A.	I no longer recall.  You're talking about November 1994.  I really no longer recall.  But if you can probably give me more information, that might be very useful for me. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'm going to ask that the report of the interview of this witness, both in French and in English, of the 18th of November 1994, be shown to the witness. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, you've seen that before, haven't you? 
A.	Yes.  I saw this document when I arrived here.  It was when I arrived here that I saw this document, and we even made corrections to the document.  You can refer to my will-say statement.  Now, it's written 19th November 1994.  I no longer recall.  Whether there was another date -- even the dates do not tally.  That's the reason why I'm saying that you should always show me similar documents, because sometimes these documents contain errors. 
Q.	Do we agree that you were interviewed on or about the 18th of November 1994 by a woman by the name of Lynne Goldberg? 
A.	No.  I don't agree with you, and I've said as much elsewhere.  I do not agree with you on that.  When I look at this document, I am comparing it with another document which was given to me when I arrived here.  If I'm not mistaken, the names that I'm seeing here were not there.  Maybe the Prosecutor -- Prosecutor can help us and show us that document.  I'm referring to the document he showed me at my arrival here.  Otherwise, I do not remember very well.  I do not remember very well the event that is relevant to this document.  So the situation has to be clarified.  Maybe I can ask you to request the Prosecutor to show us the document that he showed to me when I arrived here. 
Q.	Were you also interviewed by someone from the International Tribunal for Rwanda on the 4th of July 1995, a person by the name of Bob Denmark? 
A.	I don't know whether you're talking about Bob or someone from Denmark.  Well, regarding that person, I don't remember very well, but what I can say is that what is contained in this document -- in that document is correct.  But I do not remember the person.  I think I've mentioned this in my will-say statement.  I mentioned the fact that I do not really remember this person.  Given the time that has elapsed, there are certainly things that one would not be able to remember, especially because when you are doing certain things, you are not aware that there would be repercussions in future, so I do not remember. 
Q.	Well, can we agree that, in your interviews with people in organisations investigating the events in Rwanda, before you went to prison, you made no mention of Mathieu Ngirumpatse having called for the extermination of Tutsis in meetings in February 1992? 
A.	If you look carefully at the content of this document, please look at it carefully, this was a statement in general terms.  Mr. Robinson, you don't -- you shouldn't mix things up.  I'm going to answer it seriously on this matter.  You shouldn't mix things up.  If someone comes and asks about circumstances under which his brother was killed because he has information on that incident, and then there are others who come to ask him questions about what happened to his brothers, one cannot speak about everything concerning the genocide.  This was the lives of my brothers who were killed, and, in fact, they were killed.  These were questions that were put to me.  They did not come to ask me questions on the manner in which Mathieu established the Interahamwe and how the Interahamwe subsequently killed people.  Because sometimes you are asking questions which hurt the feelings of people who have lost their kith and kin.  Look at this document.  There's no mention of the MRND there.  So that is the situation.  Please, don't try and remind me of painful events.  Let me stop there. 
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, can you point to any document before you went to prison in which you had ever accused Mathieu Ngirumpatse of urging the extermination of Tutsis during meetings in February 1992? 
A.	I'm going to repeat this.  You said that the Rwandan government had negotiated with me to allow me to be freed.  I've understood your question now.  You were thinking that I was under arrest and imprisoned, and so I negotiated with government to be freed so that I could testify against those persons.  That isn't true.  This is my initiative and my conscience tells me how -- what I should do.  I have seen how people suffered inside and outside their country.  So I personally decided that I must say what role these people played in the genocide, and I knew that there was a tribunal which had been created, and you must know that I never left my country.  Even after the war, I assisted people up until 1998.  So when I was in detention, I saw people who were suffering greatly because of the actions of these people.  So I said I'd like to come to this Court to tell them about these people.  There was no meeting and there was no question of talking with government.  Because I think I see what you're getting at in your question.  You want to project the idea that I was promised something in exchange for coming to say these things.  That is not at all the case.  Government was in no way involved in my release.  I know what that means, you know?  You thought that when I went to prison, I negotiated with government; I contacted the government and negotiated with it.  That is not the case.  I'm going to tell you something -- any way, let me just stop there, Mr. Robinson. 
Q.	So the answer to my question then, if you could point to any document before you went to prison in which you had ever accused Mathieu Ngirumpatse of calling for the extermination of Tutsis in 1992 is "no."
A.	When I was in prison -- are you referring to that time?
Q.	I'm asking you if, at any time before you went to prison, you could point to us any document which shows that you told anybody that, in 1992, in February, Mathieu Ngirumpatse had called for the extermination of Tutsis.  
A.	It seems to me that the dismissal letter does not mean anything to you.  Does it really not mean anything to you?  This is a letter that dates from 1992.  This letter is important and contains much important information.  You must analyse this letter.  Aside from the idea that you are defending these people, you should analyse that letter, and you should take a second look at the important elements that President Habyarimana emphasised during that rally.  And you should also include the request that he made of Mathieu who was the secretary-general.  You will see how cruel Mathieu was.  He's not alone in that.  It is possible -- possibly true that it is he who created this organisation.  However, the Interahamwe liked Mathieu very much.  I am sure that the Interahamwe would like to see Karemera and the others sentenced.  But in view of the relationship they had with Mathieu, they would not like to see him sentenced.  So that is my position in respect of that document.  That is my position.  That is what I've explained to you regarding the document. 

In terms of document -- I think that document should be enough for you and then you should also look at what happened afterwards. 
Q.	Okay.  Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I'm coming to the very end of my cross-examination now, and I'm going to give you an opportunity to comment on what we believe to be the true situation with respect to your case.  And I want to tell you that I know you have survived horrific events, and I respect you for that, and you have my sympathy for that.  But it's our position that Mathieu Ngirumpatse never called for the extermination of Tutsis, and our investigation of the list of people who you claim heard that at the meetings in February 1992 has revealed so far 12 people, all of whom say that Mathieu never said such things, including a Prosecution witness who has testified in this very trial.  And it's our position that there were never any axes, extermination songs, or any such things at those Interahamwe meetings in February of 1992, and it's our position that the real reason that you left the MRND is just what you said in your resignation letter:   That you had been pushed aside in the youth movement, and that your medical expenses were not being covered by the MRND.  And it's our position that the reason that there's nothing in your resignation letter, the newspaper articles about your resignation, the interviews with law enforcement that you conducted prior to 2000, is that, in fact, Mr. Ngirumpatse never called for the extermination of Tutsis at those meetings.  And that you only first decided to accuse Mathieu Ngirumpatse when you found yourself in prison and you wrote to the ICTR and you gave your statement in 2001, and that your account of the February meetings respectfully is a complete fabrication.  That's our position.  Would you like it comment on that? 
A.	That's good, Mr. Robinson.  I'm going to make a comment of my own.  I understand you.  You're Defence counsel.  I understand you.  It's a good thing.  It's a beautiful performance for a Defence counsel, I might say.  But it's all in a day's work, I'm sure, and I'm sure that you're doing your job very well.  But I tell you one thing:   I did not even know that there were other witnesses talking about Interahamwe.  That is not a problem.  

I don't know whether these witnesses had been -- had given testimony before me, but I told you, I'm telling you, that any witness, Prosecution or Defence, who took part in the Interahamwe will do anything to have Mathieu acquitted, even if it means having the others sentenced.  I did not know what you just told me.  I don't know how Mathieu conducted himself so that they love him so much.  I think it is because of the Interahamwe that he was elected by the attendants or the participants at the congress.  It is not because I was in prison that I spoke of Mathieu in these terms, because I want to -- to talk to you in respect of what your conclusion is first.  Rwandan Tutsis were killed.  Counsel, do you understand that?  

Following the MRND ideology, which started from 1959, the second they got together they created the Interahamwe to massacre people.  You have just told me that I was set aside in the youth movement.  But this was because I didn't share their ideals; that is, the extermination of the Tutsis.  I wasn't really set aside.  I left, myself.  It is -- it was my personal decision to leave this organisation. 

Thirdly, young Hutus, who were involved in these activities, killed their Tutsi brothers for no reason. 

Four:  Rwandan citizens were arrested and imprisoned.  Amongst them there were some who participated in these activities, and others who did not get involved in the massacres.  All of this is to be blamed on the people who prepared those events. 

Fifthly, the consequences for widows and orphans, who had to -- who had to feed their imprisoned husbands, all of this is to be blamed on these people. 

Sixthly, people went into exile.  They were killed by diseases like Cholera in the Congo and elsewhere, and this happened because they were in exile.  Even up until today there are Rwandan children who are being taught these genocidal ideas and they go on fighting.  What are they fighting against?  

Seventhly, the ideology is still in the minds of Rwandans which is why parties like the MRND were dissolved. 

Today we have problems like poverty, trauma.  There is a climate of mutual suspicion.  All of this is in the minds of the people, and it is because of these men who thought that they were working based on heritage or the legacy of 1959.  I think you understand all of that, Mr. Robinson.  You have drawn a conclusion.  I think that the fronts that they have used to run this Court could be used for something more important, instead of trying to examine what these -- these people did.  All of this can be blamed on these men.  That is why I'm being hunted.  That is the only reason.  

Please ask the Rwandan government what all of this is about.  All the victims and witness -- even the witness -- witness and witness protection section had forbidden me from talking about what -- the fact that I was coming here to give testimony, and I told no one, least of all the government.  

I am telling you all of this, Mr. Robinson, so that -- I'm saying this because you're trying to get your client cleared, but that is not true.  You will even see other Interahamwe who will come and tell you that Nzirorera did some bad things.  They will testify against him.  But I'm telling you, all of this is Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  I'm telling you this frankly.  I'll explain.  

There was someone who was taken out of the beating.  I think I mentioned this the last time.  To go back somewhat, you might ask him about the meetings that were held in Eden Garden Restaurant.  His daughter, Juanita, was not involved in the Interahamwe as a young girl.  I'm referring here to Juanita Ngirumpatse.  I'll tell you the entire truth, Counsel.  I do not wish to make unjust accusations against anyone here.  Do you understand me, Mr. Robinson?  All you have done is seek to clear your client.  Well, that is the work of Defence counsel.  I agree.  It's all right.  But I have told you about the facts, the events that I witnessed.  

You said that the Interahamwe told you they did not know these persons.  That's what you're telling me; that they knew -- they all knew, and they knew that I'm telling the truth.  They know that I'm telling the truth.  When you ask people if they know me, they will say, "Oh no, I don't know this person."  Because even after all of this, I never took part in the massacres with these people.  They might have known then that I had a machete or a gun.  I'm telling you the truth, Mr. Robinson.  

Anyone might come here before this Trial Chamber and, after all of these questions, somebody might think that I'm Interahamwe.  You see how this situation has complicated matters?  

There was a youth wing.  It was called Interahamwe.  Any ordinary Rwandan, be Hutu, who has no money, who has no knowledge of the Interahamwe might be considered as an Interahamwe, because the Interahamwe were set up.  We're fighting hard.  Each Rwandan is doing his best to get this history behind us.  Yet only God can help us to solve this situation.  In short, that is my response to your conclusion. 

In my testimony, he never said -- nobody said that they didn't know me.  But you say that you asked the interahamwe, and you asked them about me, and they're telling you that they don't know me.  That's odd, isn't it?  Perhaps I might come here to give testimony in other trials.  It's not only in Mathieu's trial.  There are other people who killed people.  They were working -- what -- they were working to implement what Mathieu had asked.  

Well, I'll stop there, but that is what I think of your conclusion. 
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, thank you very much for answering my questions.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I concluded my cross-examination, subject to being able to question him about his own case, and about the events of earlier 2005 once I've had an opportunity to conduct an investigation, and if I'm able to persuade the Trial Chamber that he should be recalled for that examination.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson. 

Yes, Mr. Webster?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, Your Honour, I'm a bit concerned by Mr. Robinson's last comment because there is a substantial file that was disclosed to him that was even shown to the witness and entered into evidence, and this is the file of the witness's judicial records.  Mr. Robinson has had that file for at least two or three weeks now.  We went through great efforts to have portions of it translated.  Your Trial Chamber coordinator put a lot of effort into making sure that all of the pages, that Mr. Robinson and the Defence team felt were relevant to this case, were translated.  Those translations are complete and I would invite the Court to invite Mr. Robinson to conduct his cross-examination on those judicial records now.  

The witness is here, he has entered those records into evidence through this witness about 15 minutes ago, and any cross-examination on that portion of the witness's judicial records should be conducted now.  

We have another 15 minutes before 10 o'clock.  We also have time this afternoon, and it would be inappropriate for Mr. Robinson to hold his hand at this stage and then make an application to come back and have this witness called back to do what he can do right now.  So that's my application. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, as you know, I've been unable to conduct investigations in Rwanda because of the problem with my investigator and the Rwandan government.  I'm going there next week.  I had to make some choices to finish my cross-examination within the timeframe that you gave me, and I chose to refrain from going into areas that might have to be repeated once my investigation was complete.  So that's the choice I made, and I think it's the most prudent way to have used the last of my time here today.  And when I make my application to you, Mr. Webster can at that time make his arguments and you can make your decision. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, we still have another 10 minutes.  We are coming back this afternoon.  The Court has set aside an hour and a half for me to conduct the direct examination.  I am willing to surrender one half hour from my hour and a half that the Court has given me for Mr. Robinson to complete his cross-examination on this aspect of the witness's testimony.  If he would like to continue the cross-examination to cover this witness's judicial records that he has had, that have been translated, that are available now, he should do so.  And if he chooses not to do so, the Court should note that for the record and take that into consideration when the application comes at a later time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we considered very seriously the interests of justice when we were making our scheduling order, and we have satisfied ourselves that our order was fair.  At least that's our -- how we have seen what we have done.  We think that it is fair for you to have an opportunity to have the witness recalled in relation to new material that has resulted from late disclosure which (unintelligible) this examination.  But we think that we have already dealt with the issue concerning these particular records, and we do not consider that new material.  So if, in fact, there are issues which you are -- which you can address, on the information which you already have, you should do it now, because that will be a principle which we will apply at any subsequent application that you might make.  

We think that the application to have the witness recalled should only be granted if we are satisfied that the new material produces matters which could be exculpatory or affect the witness's credibility, and that is the principle on which we would act.  

So we would not -- I don't think you persuade us in relation to matters which you already have access to.  So in light of that, if you wish to ask any other questions, you can continue. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, would you like me to begin that now, or should we wait until after we have the next witness?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much time do you think you will take?  You see, it might be sensible to stop now because we have -- we just have four minutes before we break in any event, so we will do that. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  I think I can do it within the timeframe of what you have already allotted me, plus perhaps the half hour offered by Mr. Webster, or maybe I could even do it shorter than that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I think without starting the cross-examination, there are matters in relation to the judgement that we can take two minutes to deal with.  It was already admitted into evidence.  The Prosecution did not object.  But it's a large document.  When I reviewed the document, and in my communication with the parties, I identified two portions of it:   Factual findings, and the judgement itself.  The way I've organised my files, I've attached the translations to each page of the relevant Kinyarwanda portions that the Defence identified.  It's a confusing document, and what I would suggest is that, together with Mr. Fry and Mr. Robinson, perhaps we could get together and organise it in a way that it's going to be easy for someone, who's not familiar with it, to make sense of it.  And I make that request now so that Mr. Robinson can give it some thought.  But the K-numbering on the document is out of order, and unless we qualify it with the -- while the witness is here to be cross-examined on how it's going to be organised, we may run into problems.  So I would make that request now, that Mr. Robinson and Mr. Fry and I can look at it, and separate it into factual findings and judgement, and identify the irrelevant translations. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would it be possible to be done before 11 -- 11.15?
MR. ROBINSON:
I think if we have a small break, we can do that any time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will rise now for just two or three minutes, because we would like to resume at 10 o'clock, if Mr. Morley could be here.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, there are two points that I would like to discuss or tell you about first.  This is the request I made of you.  Secondly, I told you how the Defence is organised in Kigali.  They started this a while ago, which is why, Mr. President, you may have observed the Defence counsel's attitude a while ago.  

I'm asking the Trial Chamber, as you did when my passport was confiscated -- was seized, you worked with the Rwandan government so that I would be able to get my passport back, whereas the Defence was working with the others to cause me problems.  So I would like this to appear on the record so that, if I return to Rwanda, I would like this to be clear:  That the Defence is putting my personal security at risk, and the Defence is working with some people whose names I do not know.  Although I do have some names, I shall not give them to the Defence at this time.  I shall give these names to the people who can deal with this matter when the time comes.  In any case, I'm just expressing my concerns about my personal safety to you.  I'll stop here. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The comments that you make, the Chamber did not work with the Rwandan government, or any other authority, when we were addressing the issue of your passport.  We took a purely judicial approach to it, and it produced a satisfactory result.  The issues that you have raised now, we will think about it.  We are not certain that it is a matter which should be dealt with in this forum.  But if we think that there's another agency in the Tribunal that is more appropriate for addressing this problem, we will give you a direction as to -- to whom your application should be made.  But I'm not -- I doubt that we are in a position to respond in any other way to the comments that you have just made. 

We will take a short break now. 
(Court recessed from 10:07H to 10:15H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Good morning, everybody. 

Mr. Registrar, could you activate The Hague, please?  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  Can you hear me?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour.  Good morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley will continue the examination. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you, Your Honour.
WITNESS G,
RE-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Good morning, Witness G.  This is the last leg, do you understand?  You will be helping us for about an hour and a half; I will be asking questions for about an hour.  Do you understand? 
A.	There are some sound issues just like yesterday.  I didn't get everything you said. 
Q.	Let's see if we can proceed.  There was a letter written by the Interahamwe committee on the 19th of January 1994 to Mr. Booh-Booh, the United Nations special representative in Kigali.  Do you remember that letter? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Who drafted it? 
A.	Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	There was a communiqué written by the committee for the Interahamwe on the 1st of February of 1994.  Do you remember that communiqué? 
A.	No.  I don't recall. 
Q.	It is our D. NZ17, entitled "Communiqué de committee nationale des interahamwe du MRND concernant le problemè crucio."  Do you remember it? 
A.	I don't recall that communiqué.  It's in -- at that time there were many different letters. 
MR. MORLEY:
Perhaps D. NZ17, our tab 87, might be put in front of the Witness, please.  And for the record, Your Honour, the previous letter dated the 19th of January is at tab 86.  It's Prosecution Exhibit 13.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Do you have the document, Witness G? 
A.	Yes, sir.  I do. 
Q.	Do you remember that document? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Who drafted it? 
A.	The chairman of the MRND. 
Q.	Name, please.  
A.	Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	There were a variety of speeches from President Sindikubwabo commencing with the 8th of April and moving through to, I think, May of 1994, which you were asked to look at by my learned friend, Mr. Robinson.  Do you remember reviewing some of the speeches of President Sindikubwabo? 
A.	Yes, sir. 
Q.	In none of those speeches is there any suggestion that anyone killing people at roadblocks will be subject to any form of marshal law or immediate arrest.  What do you make of that? 
A.	No. 
MR. MORLEY:
Translation issue.  I would ask, please, that the translators today do their very best as we are short of time.  I will repeat the question.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	In none of the speeches of President Sindikubwabo, which have been referred to you, is there any suggestion by the president, "In order to calm the situation in Rwanda, that people at roadblocks would be subject to any form of marshal law or arrest by the military."  What do you make of that? 
A.	I believe that President Sindikubwabo did not want the massacres to come to a stop.  He did not want to forbid people from killing others. 
(Pages 1 to 14 by Jennifer Spring)


























	1015H
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	When he was saying in his speeches that he wanted peace and harmony; did you believe him.
A.	No.
Q.	Mr. Robinson took you to a piece of transcript in respect of something Prime Minister Jean Kambanda said about the Red Cross; do you remember being asked about what Prime Minister Kambanda had said about the Red Cross?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What was the date of the meeting at the Diplomat hotel (sic) when you were asked to tour the roadblocks. 
A.	It was the 10th of April.  
Q.	What was your understanding of the reason why you were being asked to go round the roadblocks and ask that the killings was (sic) stopped? 
A.	For me, it was a way to clear the dead bodies that were (inaudible) along the roads of Kigali, because the international community had already come to Kigali and were able to see the damage that had already been done; there were many dead people in the streets; there were very many dead people. 
Q.	As part of your tour, were you asked to disarm anyone? 
A.	No.  
Q.	As part of your tour were you asked to arrest anyone? 
A.	No. 
Q.	As part of your tour, were you asked to dismantle any of the roadblocks? 
A.	No. 
Q.	As part of your tour, were you asked to send the Interahamwe home? 
A.	No. 
Q.	How long did the killings remain stopped for? 
A.	I believe the killings stopped in Kigali -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
Mr. President, we apologise, there was a cut in the line and the interpreters did not hear the answer.  We apologise for that. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I am afraid we lost you on the line a moment ago, I will repeat the question for how long did the killings stop? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Sometimes I wonder; I will try the question again with the assistance of the translators, please. The question is; for how long did the killings stop?
JUDGE SHORT: 
Mr. Morley, your question is a little bit awkward --
MR. MORLEY:
It ought to be.
JUDGE SHORT: 
A better question would be; "For how long did the killings continue?" - but, when you say; "For how long did the killings continue?" -- it is a little bit difficult to comprehend.
MR. MORLEY:
The evidence is that the killings stopped as a result of the tour, but not for long.  And I'm asking for "How long did the killings stop?" I submit it is a fairly straightforward question.
JUDGE SHORT:
If you had introduced what you just said, then the question (inaudible) namely, that the killings did not stop for long.
MR. MORLEY:
I am grateful for Your Honour's assistance, I can only imagine that Mr. Robinson would have been leaping up to his feet if I had asked the question in that way, because it would have been suggesting the answer. 

I wonder if I might return to the witness?  
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	Witness G, can you hear me? 
A.	Yes, sir. 
Q.	What is the answer to the question, please? 
A.	The killings did not stop.  
Q.	What could have been done to really stop the killings other than send you and some friends in a jeep scurrying round Kigali.  
A.	I believe if the government and the party leaders had decreed laws strongly condemning those killings and if they had called on the military to break down the roadblocks and tell people to go home; if they had punished the killers, I believe the killings would have come to a stop on the same day. They needed to set an example and enforce the law. 
MR. MORLEY: 
	I wonder if the witness might take his headphones off, please? 
With the assistance of Mr. Isa (phonetic), please, I have an application which I hope will not trouble the Court for long; it relates to the propriety of asking this witness questions in relation to other things that Prime Minister Jean Kambanda said. 

Your Honour, and Your Honour's colleagues, will recall that Mr. Robinson put into evidence, and before the witness, a section of Jean Kambanda's, I think, evidence, or at least a transcript -- a transcript of something that he said previously and the witness was invited to look at that material to establish whether he agreed with it.  

I have an application that, because my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, has opened the door, if I can use that expression which may be familiar to Your Honour from another place -- has opened the door to the Kambanda material that some of the Kambanda material can be asked of by this witness to see if he agrees with it or not.  

I've taken the courtesy of distributing to my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, at an early stage yesterday -- and to his colleagues -- sections of Kambanda interviews which he went through some time ago, and it is my application that I question this witness on a small section of those transcripts, because the door has been opened.  I imagine that there will be an opposition to it and I don't wish to trouble the Court for long, given time constraints.  The argument is no more developed than Mr. Robinson has opened the door.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, we definitely, strongly, oppose any introduction of other statements by Mr. Kambanda beyond the scope of the direct examination, and I can tell you it will lead to request for lengthy re-examination. I think the legal issue is very simple for you, and that is whether -- to what extent the door has been opened by my question about the Red Cross operation to collect dead bodies in the streets of Kigali.  
	
If you recall, the witness was asked about when he met with Mr. Nzirorera, and the situation with Mr. Nzirorera, and he said: "I asked him to tell the people to bring the bodies to the road so that they could be collected" and he said the international community --  Mr. Nzirorera had made reference to the international community.  So, in that connection in order to refresh his recollection concerning the fact that the international community was already present in the Kigali, and they were the ones who were asking that bodies be collected for sanitary reasons, I showed him the statement of Mr. Kambanda, given under oath before the appeals chamber in his own case, which was not admitted into evidence.  

Now, the question is whether it's by doing that that opens the door to everything that Mr. Kambanda has said about these events, in any way and, obviously, it doesn't because if you were to apply that rule, then any time you made a reference to an individual, then everything that individual had said about the Rwandan events becomes relevant. We will be here for ten years.  So I think that there's a legal matter -- Mr. Morley is more than entitled to ask about Mr. Kambanda's references to the Red Cross, and that event, but no further than that.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. Weyl? 

MR. WEYL:
Yes.  Mr. President, I object for the same reasons that Mr. Robinson has raised and I would add simply that yesterday at the end of the hearing we received a document, a quite lengthy document in English.  It was never said that this document was going to be disclosed. I have been criticised for disclosing the list of documents I was going to use two days before my cross-examination and now I'm given a document in English at the last minute in those conditions.  I believe that these questions should not be able to be asked of the witness and -- in addition to my objection along the same lines of Mr. Robinson's.  Thank you.  Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Mr. Morley, we have adopted a slightly more restricted approach as to what your entitlements are than what you have proposed. We think that the issue was raised when the document was shown to the witness but -- the document has not been put in evidence; so we think that you could use it if the quotation put was out of context or there was other material in the document which is rebuttal; you are entitled to rebut the proposition through the contents of that interview.  We don't think it opens up all other speeches.
MR. MORLEY:
Can I tell Your Honour that what I am proposing to do is to put to the witness certain observations of Jean Kambanda about these three defendants, and ask the witness whether he agrees or disagrees with those observations?  

Now, I am not proposing to tell Your Honour what the observations are, because that then does the damage we are trying to avoid.  But I'm not going to be asking about the Red Cross, I am going to be asking, effectively, about the guilt of those three defendants. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
	All we did note was that it was exactly (inaudible) ... we do not think that should be admitted.
MR. MORLEY:
I think Mr. Weyl agrees; he just sat down again.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I am sorry, Mr. Weyl (inaudible) okay, okay.
 MR. WEYL:
Yes, Mr. President, but I think that you've stepped ahead of my objection.  That's exactly what we cannot accept from the Prosecution, especially in the conditions where he will use a witness today.  It seems he wasn't able to obtain (inaudible) testimony in another trial, we won't have the chance to re-examine the witness and I think that this procedure is absolutely unacceptable.  I know that you've understood completely, Mr. President, by telling Mr. Morley that he cannot use the statements in that manner.  

MR. MORLEY: 
I will move on, Your Honour, thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:  
Q.	The next matter to raise, Witness G, is you were referred to Prosecution Exhibit 15. C at tab 171; there is no need to put the item in front of you; it is the speech of President Sindikubwabo, in Butare on the 19th of April and you may recall that Mr. Robinson, when he cross-examined you, was suggesting that the use of the word "work" by the president was an innocent use of that word; do you understand what I've said? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	I am now looking, please, at that Exhibit P. 15C page 5K-number -- K, K0332820, top of the page.  I shall read from it: "These are times of war.  What does this mean? Well, this means that those who only expect others to work and who stand by as uncommitted onlookers should be unmasked.  They should not disturb us from working.  They may stand by as observers but they shall not be part of our team.  If any one says to himself, 'That does not concern me, I'm afraid' let that person depart from us.  Let those in charge of getting rid of such persons do so as quickly as possible.  There are other good workers ready and willing to serve their country."  Do you understand what I have read? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	What's the president talking about? 
A.	On my view, the president was there to incite the population of Butare to incite the killings.  When he uses the word "work" and he explains it; it is not a matter of day to day chores. It is to start what the others have already finished, or begun, in other prefectures; and we know that Butare prefecture was calm and it was only with this speech and the swearing in of the new prefet there were killings; for me and those who heard that speech on that same day was to start the killings as had been done in other prefecturs.  Those people who didn't want to go along with what the others were doing, those people should set themselves aside. 
Q.	Were you present in Butare for when that speech was delivered? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you help us with whether or not Ngirumpatse, Karemera or Nzirorera were present in Butare for when that speech was delivered? 
A.	I didn't see them. 
Q.	The president refers to his government as the "Abatabazi government"; what was meant by that term "Abatabazi"? 
A.	They are the liberators. 
Q.	The liberators from what? 
A.	To free them from the enemy and the enemy at that point in time was the RPF and the Tutsis. 
Q.	Turning to the speech by Jean Kambanda, same day, 19 April 1994, Exhibit D. NZ 31C, tab 169, no need for you to have it in front of you; page 15 -- K number, K0273606. I am reading nine lines down from the top of the page.  The prime minister says, hot on the heels of the president, "They should remember no commune should be infiltrated by the enemy, by the RPF, we trust the population; we have confidence that they will help you because they are willing and able.  They do not want us to be taken back, to the 1959 yolk."  Do you understand what I have said?  
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	What is the prime minister saying he trusts the population to do? 
A.	He means to say that he has confidence in the people and that they are going to be responsible for the elimination of the enemy, which was the RPF. 
Q.	And is the RPF characterised in any other way by this stage, the 19th of April 1994? 
A.	The RPF was made up of the RPA, the RP army, which was mostly the Tutsis from outside, and the Tutsis from within. 
Q.	And how was the occupation supposed to identify infiltrators?
A.	You know, people knew who everyone was, within the population.  Someone would know their neighbour and whether they were Tutsi or not.  If that person sent his child to -- for training, he would know, and to identify the enemy, telling that to the population meant that you have Tutsis as your neighbours next door, so it was saying that the Tutsis were the enemy. 
Q.	I turn now to D. NZ36 article put in by Mr. Robinson in relation to an interview of the 13th of May 1994 with chairman of the Interahamwe, Kajuga; no need to have the document in front of you.  The article, which is now an exhibit, reads in the third paragraph: "His organisation of youths was created in October 1991, during the first civil war against the RPF by members of the MRND." Is that true? 
A.	Could you please repeat what you have just read? 
Q.	I will move on.  Next item, sixth paragraph, Kajuga is quoted as saying: "We have taken weapons from the enemy and the army has given them to us in order to ensure civil defence."  What does that say about what Kajuga is saying about the relationship between the army and the Interahamwe in May of 1994? 
A.	The army in 1994, in May -- I am sorry, in May 1994, the Interahamwe and the army worked together, and the Interahamwe were called upon to go to the front together with the army.  
Q.	Kajuga goes on to say, or it is quoted as: "They admit that innocent people have been killed."  Do you agree with that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	It goes on to say, second column, second paragraph: "Near the roadblocks, held by, or manned by the militia men, dead bodies were lined up; bodies of men, but also of women and adolescents." Do you agree with that? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	It goes on to say, this being the 13th of May:  "From the 6th of April, more than 200,000 people have been killed."  Do you agree with that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	It goes on to say: "The association of the Interahamwe affirms that it is controlling its members --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry about that pronunciation, I did not quite understand what you are trying to say, Mr. Morley.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	They are more than a million in number -- 13th May of 1994, by then events in Rwanda are in full swing; do you agree with that?  
A.	But you should not forget the fact that in April -- May 1994, all the youths from the MRND, JGR, all of them were considered to be Interahamwe and their number was more than one million; that's true.
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr.  President, I just want to correct the record of something and Mr. Morley can tell me if I am wrong; the statement about the million was not made by Mr. Kajuga; it was made by Ephrem Nakarabesa. I think that should be put to the witness, if I am correct about that.
MR. MORLEY:
Very well, I take the point.
BY MR. MORLEY:  
Q.	The short point is that in the article, it is saying that the Interahamwe has control of its members and a man called Ephrem Nakarabesa says that the Interahamwe now numbers more than a million; do you understand what I have said?  
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	By May of 1994, was the organisation of the Interahamwe -- for whatever reason, its numbers had swelled to a million -- in control of that sort of people.  
A.	No. 
Q.	If the report says that the Interahamwe remains in control of its members, do you agree with that that the Interahamwe was in control of its members, on 13th of May 1994?  
A.	I don't quite understand your question, what you want to ask me. 
Q.	Translation issue.  The report is an interview with Kajuga; it reports -- it reports that it is being said that the Interahamwe remains in control of its members.  Do you understand what I have said? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What were its members doing to the Tutsi? 
A.	Its members were killing Tutsis. 
Q.	Who was in control of the Interahamwe? 
A.	You know, the Interahamwe formed an association which was affiliated to the MRND; so I believed the MRND controlled the Interahamwe. 
Q.	13th of May 1994, Interahamwe control -- who is exercising control over the Interahamwe on the      13th of May; I want the names of the MRND people, please? 
A.	What I can tell you about the Interahamwe in Kigali, or of Kigali, is that they were under the control of numbers 6, 7, 8, and 9. 
Q.	And who controlled them please, name? 
A.	As far as I know, the person who controlled numbers 6, 7 and 8 in the executive committee of the MRND was Joseph Nzirorera.  
Q.	Next document please, D. NZ 38; you don't need to have it in front of you.  It is an excerpt from a radio broadcast.  I am looking at page marked as page 11; at the bottom - K-number, K0149987; it is Mathieu Ngirumpatse speaking on the radio in relation to the Hotel des Mille Collines; and he is saying; "It is true that the MRND party has learned with the pleasure and satisfaction of the decision of the government to accede to the request that those who are hindered from leaving the places where they are be released, in particular the Hotel des Mille Collines.  I would like to urge that as of now, as from today, that from this message, that our members, particularly the youths who I -- it is not particularly true, but I am inviting them from this moment on to release these people."  Do you understand what I have read? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	What does that tell you about the influence Mathieu Ngirumpatse was able to wield over those roadblocks? 
A.	He was chairman of the MRND and the people manning the roadblocks were mostly the Interahamwe of the MRND.  He was the head of the MRND, so those people took him as their leader, their president.  He had total influence over them. 
Q.	And just remind us after Mr. Ngirumpatse intervened, were the people able to leave the Hotel des Mille Collines? 
A.	Yes, the people left the Hotel des Mille Collines. 
Q.	I wanted to ask you about the Wednesday meetings that took place from around November 1991 into the earlier parts of 1992; how regular were they, were they every week or were they more often; can you give us some idea? 
A.	These meetings took place on every Wednesday of every week, from 5 p.m. until 8 p.m. or 9 p.m., quite late. 
Q.	For example, looking at a calendar, it is a fact that the 1st of January, that's New Year's Day 1992 and Christmas day 1991, those were Wednesdays; were there meetings on those days? 
A.	No.  The meetings would take place during weekdays, not on public holidays or religious holidays. 
Q.	Do you have any records in writing anywhere which can show precisely which days the meetings took place? 
A.	I did not quite understand your question, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Do you have any records-- for example -- in a diary for example; or notes for example, which show exactly which Wednesdays these meetings took place? 
A.	I do not have myself, but during the initial days after the establishment of the Interahamwe, it was decided that that would be the situation; and it continued.  At each meeting there was a register kept; the registers were for people to put their names down as they came in, and these registers were in an office at the secretariat, in an office that the MRND had set aside in its offices.  I cannot be more specific than that.  
Q.	In terms, then, of recalling the Wednesday meetings, are you relying purely on your memory of 12 years ago? 
A.	I think ********************************************************************************************************* ********during those meetings.  Had there been another meeting which was supposed to have been held, that would only be rallies, and those would take place on Saturdays or Sundays and those would not be meetings as such; those would only be rallies. 
Q.	Two last areas of questions; Witness G, you told us that the Interahamwe recruited a lot of young men in the early stages of the organisation, in order -- a lot of young men -- I will start that again.  You told us that in the early stages a lot of young men were attracted to the Interahamwe because of the offer of employment; do you remember telling us that? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Did these young men find employment in parastatal organisations? 
A.	Yes, some found work. 
Q.	Can you please list the parastatal organisations over which Mr. Ngirumpatse had influence? 
A.	I might say Electrogas, the Ministry of Public Works, Rwanda Tel, Serta, to name just those few. 
Q.	Did members of the Interahamwe, to your knowledge, ever have employment in any of those organisations? 
A.	Please repeat the question?  
Q.	Did members of the Interahamwe ever have employment, to your knowledge, in any of those organisations? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did Mr. Ngirumpatse have any influence over the organisations known as OCIR The, Sorwal and Magerwa? 
A.	Magerwa, do you mean?  
Q.	You pronounce it better than I do? 
A.	Perhaps Magerwa.  I think the word that you referred to as OCIR The, I know nothing of. 
Q.	It is a tea company? 
A.	I don't think that there was any tea factory called YCSS Magerwa --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honours, I think there was some problem with this thing; it was referred to as OCISS (sic) and I think that they were trying to refer to OCO (sic) The; there was an error; perhaps the prosecutor might correct that.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	I am running out of time; can we get this right, please?  Three organisations, translator please help,  OCIR Tea, "tea" as in the drink, S-O-R-W-A-L and Magerwa, M-A-G-E-R-W-A? 
A.	OCIR The was run by a member of the MRND; that was Michel Bagaragza; Magerwa, I really don't remember much about that.  I don't remember who the last director general of Magerwa was.  
Q.	I am going to move on; did Mr. Nzirorera have any influence over any large organisations or parastatal bodies that could employ the Interahamwe? 
A.	I don't know.  What was the name you used there, Ngurusisa? 
Q.	The name I used, for the assistance of the translator, is the Defendant in this case Mr. Nzirorera.  I will repeat the question.  Did Mr. Nzirorera have any influence over any large organisations or parastatal bodies which could employ the Interahamwe?  
A.	He could offer jobs or influence people getting jobs at the public works, the head office of                 Paul Echossai (phonetic) and he could also influence Electrogas.  
Q.	To your knowledge, did he do that to assist Interahamwe to become employed?  
A.	I know that there are many Interahamwe who were hired at Electrogas and Paul Echossai (phonetic).  And I would say that at Paul Echossai (phonetic), number 6 who worked in a project there.  
Q.	Last question, or last subject, it will only be about two or three questions; who was it, what organisation was being invited to form the civil defence, when you met with Gasaka (phonetic) in April?
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, I don't believe that this was the subject of any cross-examination.  
MR. MORLEY:
Mr. Robinson may be right; I think it may have arisen in direct examination, I am just searching my memory.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I must say we don't recall it either; we must ask you to assist.
MR. MORLEY:
	I am going to help Mr. Robinson. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	My last question please, Witness G, is this; were the Interahamwe ever punished, or prosecuted, or arrested, or disciplined for the killings which took place following the 7th of April, or were they, in fact, co-opted in the civil defence as the weeks went by.  
A.	The Interahamwe were not prosecuted, punished or imprisoned; on the contrary; I remember clearly when I was, I believe in Gisenyi, for the first time, I met number 2, who was in Gisenyi at that time and he told me that the ministry of defence was trying to see how it could absorb the Interahamwe into the army at the time -- that was in June 1994.  And I might add that with the meeting in the ministry of defence with Mr. Gasaki (phonetic) mention was made of the need to see how to absorb and train the civil defence force, beginning with the Interahamwe which were an organisation that already existed. 
Q.	Was Gasaka (sic) an MRND man or from some other party?
MR. ROBINSON:
Again, since my objection was that it wasn't covered in cross-examination, I think we ought to be consistent here.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, the name is Gasaki, as has just been mentioned by the witness.  So, I respectfully submit, it is a clarificatory question which leads to another. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We think a clarification question is permitted, but we don't think it should introduce a new line of examination about the witness, about  the name.
MR. MORLEY:
It's not supposed to, simply it's to (inaudible)
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	Witness G, last two questions; the ministry of defence --  which party controlled the ministry of defence at the time the decision was made to try and incorporate the Interahamwe into this civil defence programme? 
A.	It was the MRND. 
Q.	Please name the people who were controlling the MRND when that decision was taken?  
A.	The president was Mathieu Ngirumpatse; the vice-president , Karemera Edouard; national secretary, Joseph Nzirorera. 
Q.	 That is all, Witness G; thank you very much. 
MR. MORLEY: 
 	I am sorry, Your Honour, I took 63 minutes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Thank you very much, Mr. Morley.
 THE ENGLISH  INTERPRETER: 
	May the interpreters take this opportunity to express some concern, given some comments made by Mr. Morley during his re-examination regarding what he termed to be "translation" -- I believe he was referring to "interpretation" to start with; we interpreters, we are officers of the court; we do our job as best we can, but we do take exception to insinuations implying that we are not doing our job properly, as we ought. 
	
	We have also noticed that Mr. Morley has difficulty with pronunciation and this can lead to difficulties in the interpretation booth and also for the witness himself.  We had wanted to make that known to the Chamber and for it to appear on the record; by your leave, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Interpreter, it appears that your remarks were not transmitted to the French channel.  So, if you wished it to be on the record, we think -- we are not prepared to say anything else, but  we note your remarks -- but if you wish it to be on the record, you should say it again and have it interpreted by the French interpreters.
THE ENGLISH  INTEPRETER
	Yes, Mr. President, thank you for this opportunity; we do wish to have this matter on the record because it is not the first time and we have been extremely patient with Mr. Morley -- in particular this morning.  

What we wanted to have on the record is that insinuations about interpretation not being correct at all times is uncalled for, and we would wish that the officers -- or other officers of the court do recognise our competence and professionalism and not insinuate that we do not do our job properly. 

	 We do realise, however, to err is human and we do make mistakes here and there; that is human nature, but we do take exception to the fact that it was insinuated that we were constantly not doing our job properly, Mr. President. 

	It is also to be noted that Mr. Morley has difficulty with pronunciation of certain Kinyarwanda names and this has also led to difficulties in the interpretation of such - - such names.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Thank you very much ,Madam Interpreter, the remarks are noted.
	
Mr. Weyl, we give you an opportunity to address the issue that was raised yesterday, if you wish to take it.  You are not obliged to, but if you think it is not necessary, we will then close the examination of this witness now.  
MR. WEYL: 
	Mr. President, thank you; I 'm going to use the opportunity that you are offering me to address matters that will help the witness to rectify certain things that we were not able to discuss because they were raised after cross-examination.  I have three questions; I might hope to finish, by 11:18, if Mr. Witness is as cooperative -- as I hope -- with me as he was during the cross-examination.
                                                                  CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you hear me? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Thank you, I know that you must be tired of all this, but my questions will be very brief; I think you can answer very briefly as well.  My first question is this: When did you see Mr. Ngirumpatse in Gisenyi, in 1994?  To refresh your memory, it was for the medical evacuation of number 1.
A.	I think it was in the month of June 1994 -- I think.  
Q.	That is, in fact, what your answer was and your memory has not betrayed you.  When did you see him last, before that particular occasion? 
A.	In April 1994. 
Q.	Can you explain to us what the circumstances --  what were - - where and when did you see him? 
A.	I saw him on the 10th of April, 1994, when we came back from the pacification.   
Q.	Didn't you see him between the 10th of April, 1994, as you said, and June 1994? 
A.	I don't think so. 
Q.	So, you didn't see him, according to you, between the 10th of April 1994, in Kigali, and June 1994 in Gisenyi.? 
A.	I don't think so. 
Q.	So, you never saw him in Gitarama? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.
MR. WEYL: 
	Mr. President, I am done with my last questions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  

Mr. Witness, this concludes your examination.  And we would just like to thank you for giving your testimony.  It's taken a very long time, but it's now at an end.  So, you are now excused from further attendance during these proceedings.  

We will now rise for a short minute.  
THE WITNESS:
	Thank you, Mr. President.  
	(Court recessed at 1125H) 
(Pages 15 to 27 by Eleanor Bastian)















1140H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
As we resume, as far as I understand the scheduling now, and we have to make a slight adjustment, I understand that Mr. Robinson has 45 minutes, which should take us up to the time that we take our adjournment.  And that we have to break from 12:30 to 1:30.  Now, the registrar informed me that the witness has a religious activity which will not end until 2 o'clock.  So, what we -- I think we can do, we can do the status conference at 1:30.  And as soon as that is concluded we will have the re-examination of the witness, which I understand will take one hour.  And that should bring us to the end of our activities for today.  So, that is the schedule that we are committed to.

And, Mr. Robinson, you can start now.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I thought that we were finished, but I'm going to put the questions to you concerning your case in Rwanda.  So my question to you is, whether you know a woman by the name of      Beatrice Mukantwali.  That is spelled M-U-K-A-N-T-W-A-L-I. 
A.	Yes, I know her, Mr. Robinson. 
Q.	And she gave testimony at your trial, did she not? 
A.	Yes, that is true.  I don't know whether this is the appeals court here.  I don't know whether you've lodged an appeal.  I'm asking this because my rights depend on this.  And having answered that question -- when you have answered that question, then we can proceed. 
Q.	Yes, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, the answer to your question is, I did not appeal your acquittal.  

When Beatrice Mukantwali testified at your trial, she claimed that you were carrying a firearm, a grenade and wearing a long military jacket.  Was that testimony true? 
A.	To what end are you putting these questions to me?  I think I have explained this matter. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, would you kindly direct the witness to answer the question?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. Witness, the rules under which the trial operates permits a certain amount of inquiry into activities which are peripheral to these proceedings in order to assist the Chamber in assessing your overall truthfulness.  Now, it will be our responsibility to assess the questions that are put to you.  And if, in our view, they fall outside of what is permitted by the Court, we may intervene.  We don't think that this question is improper, and you should answer it.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, if I may just comment briefly, wouldn't it be more appropriate if Defence counsel were instructed to start with what he -- and if he was ever charged with a crime, and what the judicial determinations of those charges were, because here we are going right into allegations of fact.  And we don't know where they come from and how they are situated with regard to the judicial records.  My usual experience is that cross-examination on issues such as this starts with a listing of charges and dispositions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There is an element to which that is fair to the witness, so the record can -- and particularly as we know what the answers are likely to be; it would be reasonable to put it on the record, so that will be your starting point for consideration. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
That's fine.  I can do that, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, the testimony of Beatrice Mukantwali was given at a trial at which you were acquitted; correct? 
A.	I don't know what was the decision that was taken by the Trial Chamber.  The Prosecutor spoke, and the President responded to what the Prosecutor said.  I don't know what decision was taken about this. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness, the question was not intended to be very detailed.  You must know whether you were found guilty or not guilty.  And that was what the question is. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I was found guilty, I explained that. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	You were found guilty of possession of a firearm, and not guilty of other crimes; is that correct? 
A.	 Mr. Robinson, I have -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness -- 
THE WITNESS:
-- I explained this at length. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, please be patient.  Mr. Robinson is responding to an objection raised by the Prosecutor who suggested that it would be fairer to you if before he asked the specific questions he wanted to ask, he asked you at this stage to indicate what the proceedings were about, and what were the results of the proceedings.  So Mr. Robinson was responding to that request by putting these questions, it was not intended -- this, I can assure you, was not intended to put you under pressure, but it was intended to put something that was considered fair to you on the record, as preliminary to the real questions that he wants to ask.  Do you understand that now?  

THE WITNESS:
No. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So please answer as simply as possible and let us get on. 
THE WITNESS:
Don't worry, Mr. President, as Defence counsel has said, he was right, actually, in respect of the crimes of genocide and criminal enterprise.  This was what I was accused against, I was acquitted of those charges, accept for the illegal carrying of a firearm, that is what I was found guilty for.  And the gun in question and the grenade saved many people, besides the RPF soldiers found this gun and the grenade at my home.  Nobody castigated me for it.  I was unjust -- unjustly imprisoned in 1998.  However, I must say that I was found guilty of this charge that is illegally carrying a firearm and a grenade.  That is right. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And when Beatrice Mukantwali testified that you were carrying a grenade and wearing a military uniform, was that correct? 
A.	Understand this, Mr. Robinson, if that were true, the Court would not have made that determination.  However, Beatrice was saying that I was using these objects wrongly.  The fact, actually, is that the Court found that I had these weapons and I was using them to save people.  However, it is illegal for a civilian to have soldier's weapons.  That is the law, and that is why I was found guilty.  I agreed with that determination, even if I was detained for four years.  

But let's say that I accepted this, because that is to carry this firearm, it is because I wanted to save people.  I recognise that it was illegal; I was found guilty.  And I did not think it necessary to appeal.  And so the prosecutor did the same.  I would like to make this clear. 
Q.	Were you wearing a long military jacket during the events of April 1994? 
A.	That isn't true, I had a brown jacket, but it was like a military jacket.  I don't know why you are dwelling on this.  It seems to me that you would like us to go into the details of my court file.  Perhaps it would be best for you to bring this court file to me here.  In any case, you do have it.  And yesterday you claimed that the Prosecutor did not disclose some of the documents to you and that he was in violation of    Rule 68. 
It is you actually who is in violation of the law.  Even as you speak now, you are still doing that.  But since you are putting questions to me, I would just like to add that. 
Q.	Beatrice Mukantwali accused you of taking children to the stadium to train them in firearms handling; was that true? 
A.	How can that be true?  That is what you said; the Court examined what she said, her evidence, and found that it was not founded.  What do you want us to do about this?  They were lies.  They were fabrications?  You should understand this.  These past few days, lies have been told, similar lies have been told.  Unfortunately, rather, everything has been cleared up, WVSS told me about the ICTR procedure and that one must be discreet.  And I said that everything must be said publically instead.  I want the whole world to know; I think that the whole world and Rwanda need to know the truth.  People make up things, that are a fact.  
Q.	Did Beatrice Mukantwali -- well, when Beatrice Mukantwali testified that you had drawn up a list of persons to be killed, was she similarly lying? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Would counsel direct him to the reference for that last allegation, please?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, at the English translation it is page K0358556, the very last line, paragraph 41. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, do you want me to repeat that question or can you --  
A.	It is not necessary to repeat the question.  In response to this question, look at the case file.  Beatrice says that she heard this from someone.  Do you follow?  The list was found on someone else, but when information is trransmitted from person to person, it can be distorted.  This list was found on an Interahamwe. I have explained -- I have explained this to a major called Jean Habimana.  Thank God, it is this soldier who helped us.  We found this list on an Interahamwe called Jean-Paul, and would you imagine my name was on the list in question.  I was number 1 on the list, you must understand this.  People give testimony about this, and they confirmed what I am saying.  Regarding Mukantwali`s list, that is the truth, as I have told it to you, Mr. Robinson. 
Q.	Now, do you also know a person by the name of Raphaël Mugabowakigli, and I will spell that, M-U-G-A-B-O-W-A-K-I-G-L-I?
A.	Yes, I know this person very well, Mr. Robinson. 
Q.	Did he also testify at your trial? 
A.	Yes, he did this before the Prosecutor and in court.  But when he got to court, he changed his version of the facts.  Oh, I forgot to tell you this, even this lady she was hiding under my bed in my home during that time.  Afterwards people made up things.  I will just stop there for the time being, but it is a long story. 
Q.	And it is true, is it not, that Raphaël said that he had been attacked in the night of the 21st of May 1994, and he had heard your voice among those who had come to attack his house? 
A.	No, you are putting words into his mouth.  That is not what he said, Counsel.  On the contrary, he said that on the 21st of May 1994 -- I think you have before you, the transcripts of what he said.  He said on the 21st of May 1994, Interahamwe attacked him at his home to kill him.  I personally went to seek the assistance of the soldiers who were guarding the home of Jean Habyarimana.  They came and they fired into the air.  First, I threw a grenade against a tree.  Then the soldiers came and fired shots.  We went to Raphaël's house and we reassured him.  So I was among the people who came to provide him with assistance.  We reassured him.  And, indeed, it is I myself who spoke to Raphaël, telling him that he was safe.  That is what he said before the Court.  But at the prosecutor's office they had put words into his mouth, words that he had not spoken in the first place.  But in trial, he said that he had survived thanks to my help, amongst the help of other people.  

Besides, if you have the file before you, you may go further down; a question was put to him, asking him whether he was accusing me of anything whatsoever, and he answered in the negative.  All he said was that he knew that I was an Interahamwe, but that I was not involved in the killings.  I don't want to talk about ethnic origin here, but people might see somebody who is walking passed, and think that he is an Interahamwe, just like that.  But look at the file, study the file carefully.  He said that I was not involved in any killings or massacre.  But he said that he knew that I was an Interahamwe.  You will see that in the file. 
Q.	Okay, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I'm simply giving you an opportunity to explain about the accusations that were made against you in your case.  And we will carry out investigations, and I have no -- I'm not insinuating by my questions at all, that the verdict that was given in your case was in any way wrong; I'm just giving you the opportunity to comment on the allegations pending any further investigation that we might be able to conduct.   But it is true, is it not, that it is not -- it is not uncommon in Rwanda for people to give false testimony implicating others, correct? 
A.	No, that would be blaming that on all of the Rwandans, it would -- it would not be true.  You should say that some Rwandans have bad intentions, and they do this.  But if we say that, if you say that in Rwanda many people accuse others falsely, it wouldn't be true.  That is the sort of generalisation that was made when it was said that all of the Tutsi were Inyenzi, and that they should be chased, hunted down and killed.  You must not generalize.  You must avoid such generalisations.  

However, it can be said there are people who always wanted to hurt others.  I told you about what happened at the World Trade Centre, Muslims don't accept all of this; but if people plotted like Mohamed Atla and others, you must not blame all of these actions on all Muslims.  So, you cannot say -- you should not that most Rwandans don't tell the truth.  Not all Americans are bad, for instance, but some people can say that these Americans are bad.  Whereas, this is not true.  In short, do try to tell -- one must try to tell the truth in all circumstances, and be reasonable and not say unjust things that are not true about other people.  That is what I think. 
Q.	And you have experienced in -- 
A.	It has always been my position. 
Q.	You have experienced in your own case that false accusations about someone participating in the genocide can be made, correct? 
A.	Yes, I confirm this.  People could do that, but that is why we have a justice system, Mr. Robinson.  That is it.  Why do you have the courts; the justice system must exist to punish criminals, those who are guilty, and acquit those who are innocent.  That is what justice is all about, you see.  The Bench that is sitting before us now, is there for that.  And you can see the Bench will try to determine where the truth is.  And I, personally, couldn't say that these people are guilty or not.  I have no right to do that.  I say the things that I witnessed.  I leave the determination of the case to the Trial Chamber.  I'm not the   Trial Chamber. 
Q.	And it is true, isn't it, that even today in Rwanda people who have suffered some slight, or taken offence to some other person, can accuse that person of participating in the 1994 events for their own personal reasons, correct? 
A.	I can't deny that, Mr. Robinson, I didn't deny it.  I told you this a little while ago, I granted you that.  If I were to begin to tell you everything that happened to me and what is happening to me even today, you might be surprised.  But that is how life is.  The world is like that.  You don't have much choice.  That is why the government also needs to decide these matters.  Otherwise, people would be facing many problems.  Government is there to settle these issues.  I do not speak on behalf of this government.  I am speaking on the basis of what I myself have observed.  They are doing everything in their power to solve this problem, but it is a serious problem.  So, I am not speaking on behalf of this government, I'm not a politician, but I think they are doing all they can to solve this problem, and to address the consequences of what happened.  That is the fact.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I have no further questions at this time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.   
AHMED NAPOLÉON MBONYUNKIZA,
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Good afternoon, Mr. Robinson --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster.  That gentleman is Mr. Webster, he is the Prosecutor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
	Your Honour, I think that the witness is so intrigued with you; he is following your good example.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	I would like to pick up where Mr. Robinson left off, and if I could direct the Court's attention -- or for the record -- we don't have to look at them necessarily -- so that the record is clear, the portion of the witness's judicial records that concerns the factual findings, and I'm looking at the Kinyarwanda at page K0350429.  The same information can be found on the English text at K0358558, and the same passage can be found in the French text at K0357231.  And I'm going to read from the English, which is at the very top, the first paragraph on the page that I have identified as K0358558.   

Mr. Witness, I'm going to read this to you, and you tell me if you recognise this as a portion of your judgement, and if you would like to comment on it; "Whereas, after taking the oath, witness           Pascal Rutayisire was asked whether he knew Ahmed Mbonyunkiza.  He replied that he had known him since 1993, and that they remained neighbors.  He said that during the war, Mbonyunkiza was on good terms with other people and that he even used to assist victims of attacks.  He added that they did not have any weapons -- excuse me, he added that they did not -- he added that they did not have any weapons, but at one time Mbonyunkiza acquired a grenade for 200 francs so he could defend himself in case of attack.  He added that when Raphaël's house was attacked, Ahmed threw a grenade into the air and the attackers fled."  Is this in relation to the same incident that Mr. Robinson cross-examined you a few moments ago?
A.	Absolutely.  It is with regard to that.  Pardon me; from time to time when I am reminded of these things, it disturbs me.  But yes, I agree that this was the same matter that Mr. Robinson was talking about in his question. 
Q.	In which case, in addition to the victim, or the alleged victim himself, it was another witness who provided the same account that you just gave us; would you agree with that or would you like to clarify it for the Court? 
A.	Could you repeat that question for me, so that I understand it better? 
Q.	Yes, I'm sorry.  When you provided an explanation of this incident on cross-examination, my recollection of your testimony is that you said that the victim, Mr. Raphaël, explained the situation to the Tribunal, and the Tribunal relied on his explanation to acquit you of those charges.  I just read a portion of your judicial records, where another witness, not Raphaël but somebody else, provided the same account that you provided when you paraphrased Mr. Raphaël.  And I'm asking you is that accurate, is that an accurate summary of how -- of the evidence that was placed before the Court when they acquitted you, so that not only -- so that the Court took into consideration what you had to say, what Raphaël had to say, what also an independent witness had to say about that incident?  So you have an opportunity, now, to explain that to the Court.
A.	To be short, that is the situation.  That is correct.  I'm sorry, I wanting to refer to you as Mr. Robinson, but you are not, but from now on if I say Mr. Robinson, I really mean Mr. Prosecutor.  I keep thinking of Mr. Robinson, pardon me for that.  I'll tell you that that is the truth.  What I can say is this, if this document was handed to Mr. President that would be sufficient.  It would be explanation enough. 
Q.	I have two other portions of the records that I'm going to note for the Chamber.  And, witness, I understand your point that the record should speak for itself, but the records are so voluminous and the translations are some distorted I would like to clarify on the record of this proceedings where the relevant information can be found.  So, simply to clarify for the record of this proceeding, I'm referring to the K -- the Kinyarwanda text, and the portion of the judicial records that concern the judgement, K0350315.  The same item can be found in the English text at K0356089.  And it can be found in the French at K0355416.  
And if we look at paragraph 89, it starts out "finds Ahmed Mbonyunkiza not guilty of participating" and in parenthesis it says, "In collaboration with Sebuhigiro and Matabaro in that attack in which the following people died."  And then it provides a list of names.   
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could counsel please repeat that, especially the names in Kinyarwanda, for the benefit of the French booth?  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Certainly. 
 
Paragraph 89 says, "It finds that Mbonyunkiza is not guilty of participating," and then it says, "in collaboration with, two other names, I'm not going to mention those again.  Not guilty of participating in the attack in which the following people died.  "Then it lists around four or five different names, and it provides an explanation.  "Since Matabaro had said that they were not together, and that witness Raphaël testified in his defence during the hearing."  And then we continue to paragraph 90, on that same page, where it says that:  "It finds Mbonyunkiza not guilty of plotting against Emile and the members of her family and old judge, Samson, and other people since the witnesses who had initially accused him, namely," and then it goes on to list a series of witnesses, including Beatrice, had said at the hearing that he was innocent.  "Moreover, the said witnesses had claimed that they had received the information from Conseiller Grégoire, who, too, had said at the hearing that the Accused was innocent.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.       Now, Mr. Witness, with respect to the Conseiller Gregoire, is this someone who participated in those                                                                                                	attacks or was he also not involved?  
A.	Which attacks are you referring to?  Pardon me.  I was speaking in French.  In fact, what I wanted to ask was which attacks are you referring to, so that it is clear for me.  
Q.	The last series of attacks that I mentioned in the paragraph that I just read, which are the attacks of Emile and the members of a family, an old judge, Samson, and so on and so forth.  The Court reasons that it based its decision on witnesses that claimed that they -- that you were innocent, including a conseiller, Grégoire, who said at the hearing that the Accused was innocent.  With respect to    conseiller Gregoire, was he someone who was implicated in these crimes or was he an independent eyewitness? 
A. 	Grégoire was conseiller in Nyakabanda secteur during the genocide.  He closely followed the killings and the acts of genocide committed in that secteur.  He, personally, spoke before the Court about the killings at various times during that period.  At one point he, himself, had to intervene.  He talked to the attackers, specifically, with regard to Matabaro, who participated in the attack, and who pled guilty.  He explained the details about his co-perpetrators and all of the people who participated in the attack on Emile.  The conseiller was invited to speak as someone who had closely followed all of the killings that had been perpetrated in that secteur.  He even gave explanations about the plot that had been against me.  

I didn't know that he had participated in those attacks, that he was in that plot.  But he said before the Chamber that he was one of the people who had participated in the plot.  The plot was to kill me.  He himself explained that, he said we don't understand why this person is here, in this situation, why is he in jail.  He was speaking about the prison.  That is the situation.  They summoned him to appear as a witness.  But I didn't mention him as a potential witness.  The Prosecutor's office summoned him, and he was heard before the Court.  That is the answer I have to your question, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Thank you.  And the last of these series of questions, I'm going to identify for the record another portion of your judgement in the Kinyarwanda.  It appears on page K0350316.  The English translation can be found at K0356090, and the French translation can be found at K0355417.  I'm going to read from the English.  There are four short paragraphs, I'm going to read a portion of each one, and then I would like you to comment if there is anything that you would like to add, Mr. Witness.  

	Paragraph 91:  It says, "Finds Ahmed Mbonyunkiza not guilty of conspiracy, because there is no evidence that he cooperated with the criminals, especially was Grégoire, Nyirimanzi, "N-Y-I-R-I-M-A-N-Z-I", a former conseiller of Nyakabanda secteur had asserted that the Accused," referring to Mr. Mbonyunkiza, "did not participate in their meetings relating to the killings."  

	Paragraph 92, the judgement, "Finds him guilty of illegal possession of a firearm, but notes that that has nothing to do with the crime of genocide.  In fact, he had used the said weapon to defend people who were being sought, namely, Raphaël," and then there are five or six names and others.  "Thus, he must be held accountable for the crime, pursuant to the Commonwealth provisions, namely, legislative decree number 12/79 of 7 May 1979."  

	Would you like to comment on any of those two paragraphs, Mr. Witness?  A comment is not necessary; it is if you want to expand upon what I have just read into the record.   
A.	It was a lengthy document.  I would prefer that you read a portion of it to me and then I can comment, because the portions you read were quite lengthy.  It was being interpreted as you were speaking, but you were speaking very fast.  That is why it was difficult for me to concentrate.  Of course, I understand that you don't have much time for this, but I would prefer you to go more slowly.  That way, it could be interpreted bit by bit, that way I could understand, I think, better the question you put to me. 
Q.	All right, rather then read it, since I have already identified it for the record and for the Trial Chamber, I'm simply going to paraphrase each of the two paragraphs.  The first paragraph, the court states in this judgement that it finds you not guilty of conspiracy, because there was no evidence that you corroborated with any of the criminals.  And especially, because Grégoire Nyirimanzi who was a former conseiller, had asserted himself that the Accused, meaning, yourself, Mr. Witness, did not participate in their meetings, which are the meetings that Mr. Grégoire organised related to the killings that they were going to perpetrate.  Now, is that an accurate summary of the testimony that was given or is there anything that you would like to vary or add?  But you are not required to comment, because the judgement of that paragraph will speak for itself.  You have an opportunity to expand upon what I have just said.  
A.	No, you are correct.  If I had to comment on that, it would be very long, because I would have to explain how I was chased down, how I came to assist one or two people.  There were many incidents that we can speak about.  What I am telling you is what you are reading is the truth, but many other things were raised before that tribunal, but what you read is truthful.  I don't want to comment on that, it would be too long.  But what you read does reflect reality.  
Q.	And the last portion of this part of my questioning relates to the second paragraph that I read, and I'm going to paraphrase that as well.  And this paragraph is paragraph 92, and the Court articulates that it finds you or Mr. Ahmed Mbonyunkiza guilty of illegal possession of a firearm, but notes that that has nothing to do with the crime of genocide, in other words, the possession of the firearm had nothing to do with the charges of genocide that were lodged against you.  The Court goes on to state:  "In fact, he," referring to you, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, "had used the said weapon to defend people who were being sought, namely, Raphaël Mugabowakigeri, Charlotte, "and it lists three other names.  The names are not important, so I will not try to repeat them.  And the Court states, "Thus, he," referring to you, "must be held accountable for the crime, referring to the crime of possession of a firearm; pursuant to the commune law provisions, namely legislative decree," and then it provides a number and the date.  So, essentially, the Court is finding you guilty of possession of a firearm, but clarifying that its understanding of the fact, was that your possession of the firearm was to defend people who were being sought by others.  

Is that an accurate reflection of your recollection of your trial, and is there anything that you would like to add or change in what I have just read?  And once, again, you are not required to comment, comment only if it is necessary for this Trial Chamber to understand what happened in your own case. 
A.	That is correct, what you are saying is correct.  And the circumstances surrounding how I got that firearm were explained.  I believe that that information is contained in the document.  I'm talking about this because it has to do with my own personal safety.  I wanted to protect myself and others.  And in truth, it wasn't me who protected them, only God saved them, using me as a go-between.  If I had an opportunity to save people, I would have saved all of those who were killed.  In short, God saved us.  He protected us.  He helped us to survive.  

If I was able to survive, and if I did what I described with that firearm, I only did it with God's help.  He was looking down on the situation at the time.  He was observing the events.  We can't claim that anyone can do anything without God's help, without divine intervention.  That is the truth.  I know that in law, you must look at the facts.  And you don't really concern yourself with the character or thoughts of an individual.  But I know that everything we did was because God helped us do it that is the truth. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I have completed that portion of my questioning and we can conclude now, Your Honour, and start up after the Court resumes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  

We'll resume at 1:30.  We start with the status conference -- we start with the status conference as the witness has been given permission to attend a religious activity, and he will be back here at 2 o'clock.  We adjourn now for lunch. 
(Court recessed at 1245H)

(Court resumed at 1450H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Witness GFJ.  We are now ready to resume, and Mr. Webster will continue with his re-examination.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	I've only got a few questions for you.  We're at the very end of your examination.  So I'll -- I'll proceed.  
A.	Before you begin, Mr. Prosecutor, I have something to say to the President.  I will be brief.  

Your Honour, I wrote a letter to you, and I received a response to it.  However, if the response is logical, it didn't really point out who the people were who could help me.  Later on, I found out about the letter that was written about my passport, and I did understand the response from the letter I received from you.  I'm asking you, therefore, that you, with your staff, ask those people who are mentioned in the letter, people such as the registrar, ask that I be able to meet with them after my testimony is concluded.  That is my request to you, Mr. President.  

I've tried to look at the content of those two letters, and I've seen that you were correct in leading me down that path.  That was my request, Mr. President.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the communication I sent to you expressed the opinion that the appropriate authority for managing the issue you raised was the registrar.  Now, the -- by filing the communication, the matter will be delivered to the registrar as a matter of routine.  Now, Mr. Fry, who is the registrar's representative here, is somebody who you're authorised to approach for information or for assistance in making an appointment.  Now, Mr. Fry is not the registrar, and if you approach him, he will then have to make appropriate approaches to the proper authorities, and -- but you're authorised to approach him for assistance and information in this matter.  But from the judicial side, I and my staff are not going to be directly involved anymore in this matter.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
I've completely understood.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  Mr. Witness, I'd like us to begin by considering a document that was admitted in evidence during your cross-examination.  Here I'm referring to D. NZ3.  It's a document that's entitled "The MRND Objectives, Programmes, and Priorities of Actions," which was published in 1991.  We don't actually have to look physically at the document, but I'd like you to think -- I'd ask you to think back to that portion of your cross-examination.  In that document, at page 34, in the English text, it defines the objectives of the MRND -- and here I'm talking about the MRND rénové.  It describes it -- it states that the movement notably pursues the following aims:  It says, "A, struggle for the safeguard of the acquirements of the 1959 social revolution and of the 5th of July 1973 moral revolution, as well as the preservation of the republican form of state."  

It goes on to state that an objective of the MRND rénové is, "the promotion of the fundamental values of the Rwandan society in order to strengthen national unity, peace, and solidarity, and to exclude from the mentality of all the Rwandans the after-effects of fuedalism and see a union excluding discrimination of any kind."  

If we look at another document that was also entered into evidence during your cross-examination -- and here I'm referring to D. NG2, which are the MRND statutes; this was also published in 1991; and specifically Article 5 -- that provision states that the movement shall work principally to achieve the following objectives.  And again it starts with "A, to fight to safeguard the gains of the social revolution of 1959 and the moral revolution of the 5th of July 1973, and to maintain the republican form of the state."  

If we look at the third document from the MRND in 1991, it was entitled "Manifesto, Programme, and Statutes," but I'm particularly concerned with the portion that comes under the heading Roman Numeral I, sub one, and Roman Numeral I, sub two, where it again mentions the political sphere.  And without reading the entire text, again, there's this reference to the social revolution of 1959 and the moral revolution of the 5th of July 1973.  

When you look at these elaborate party schéma of statutes and programmes and objectives that all mention the social revolution of 1959 and the moral revolution of the 5th of July 1973, what do you make of them?  What do these references indicate to you, given the context of Rwandan society in 1991, and the ideals of the MRND as they were brought out in your cross-examination by Mr. Robinson?  

Maybe we could take them one at a time.  If you tell us first about the social revolution of 1959 and then about the moral revolution of the 5th of July 1973.  
A.	You're correct.  Your question is quite relevant.  Let me try to answer, according to my understanding of the situation and the way you put the question.  From what I understand and from my knowledge of this issue, and even taking into account what happened in 1959, in 1959, Tutsi homes were destroyed.  Some Tutsis were killed.  Buildings throughout the country were set afire.  People fled at that time.  Now, I wasn't born then, but this is the truth.  We learned about these things at school.  People went into exile abroad.  All of that happened because they belonged to the Tutsi ethnic group.  That is what happened in 1959, and it's the truth.  
When the MRND, by drafting its statutes, bases itself on those events, it shows that they want to achieve their objectives.  Moreover, sometimes when I think about this -- and this is what stopped me from joining the MDR after I left the MRND -- I did that because the MDR is like the MRND's ancestor, the MDR Parmehutu.  It's the -- in a way, the ancestor of the MRND.  I couldn't leave one bad situation to jump into one that was worse.  
Q.	You have an opportunity to complete your response, but I'm trying to understand -- I'm trying to put your response in context, because you were asked about two things.  And when you started to talk about the MDR and the MDR Parmehutu, are you still explaining the social revolution of 1959, or have you gone on to explain something else?  
A.	I am still talking about that revolution.  I'm not talking about new things.  I'm still in the context of that revolution because in 1959, the MDR Parmehutu was the party in power.  It wasn't in power as such, but the MDR was the party to mobilise people to kill.  So when the MRND bases itself on the 1959 revolution, it is because they knew exactly what happened in 1959.  That's when they spoke about the moral revolution of 1959.  In fact, at that time there were killings perpetrated against those people.  
Q.	What I heard in English was a reference to the moral revolution of 1959, and my question to you was on two separate issues, the social revolution of 1959 -- and that's what I read in the statutes -- and the moral revolution of July 1973.  Now, these are both references in all of these MRND statutes and programmes and manifestos, and I'm asking you -- you've already started to do it -- to explain what the significance of those two events were in relation to the forming of a new MRND in 1991.  So you've started to explain the social revolution.  If you have any understanding of the moral revolution of the 5th of July 1973, you can explain that to us as well.  
A.	I was speaking in Kinyarwanda.  I talk about -- talked, rather, about the 1959 events.  With regard to the moral or social events, the interpreters will explain that.  I'm talking about 1959.  I haven't dealt with the 1973 events just yet.  They shouldn't mix them up.  

In 1959, people went into exile abroad.  Before we talk about the 1973 events, we should talk about the constitution of 1991.  The MRND was basing itself on ideas from 1959, and that constitution -- this is in Article 1 -- pardon me, Mr. Prosecutor, it seems that you want to interrupt me in my answer.  

In 1991 -- and look closely at the constitution -- without mentioning the MRND, look at the constitution, just the constitution of the country.  The constitution was drafted by the synthesis commission, which was led by Mr. Karemera, if I'm not mistaken.  You can look at that constitution, and you see therein the ideas from 1959.  This was a power structure that had several parts -- several parties, but nevertheless, they're trying to maintain those ideas which focussed on the killings, and we saw exactly the result of that in 1994.  There were killings.  The MDR party was mobilised for the killings, for example.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  
A.	Now, let's go to 1973.  
Q.	Thank you for that response.  Now we can move on to the moral revolution of 1973.  What do you understand that to be a reference to, in the context of these documents from 1991?  
A.	In 1973, I was five years old.  I understood those events later on when I was an adult.  You have to consider the number of people who were killed after power was taken.  There were always people being killed.  They always based themselves on the killings.  Look at how many people were killed in 1973.  You can research this.  You asked me to give my impressions or reactions about those events.  What I do know is that many a person's blood was shed in 1973.  I don't want to dwell on what happened in 1973, but as a result of those events, many people were killed after power was taken over.  They died in atrocious conditions.  The MRND, when they talk about revolutions, base themselves on those events.  That's the situation.  
Q.	Do you appreciate that there -- or would you observe that there's any contradiction -- or what would you suggest is the relationship between a reference to the social revolution of 1959, and a statement that all persons are equal before the law in Rwanda, the types of statements that were brought out in your cross-examination when Mr. Robinson was examining you?  You were pointed to portions of the MRND statute that made reference to there not being an issue of ethnicity in the MRND.  And I'm asking you to compare those portions of the statutes to these references to the social revolution of 1959.  Would you draw any conclusions about the nature of the MRND, based on those references in its founding documents?  
A.	Even if the question obliges me to speak again about my friend Robinson and the questions he put to me, I'm going to say the following:  As far as I understand it, he showed me the statutes of the MRND, and he made a demonstration by underscoring the good aspects or positive aspects of the MRND, but after a certain moment, I intervened, I said to him that he should look at the previous paragraphs concerning the 1959 revolution.  Now, you are asking me to make a comparison between those two aspects.  The politics behind all this, he, first of all, showed the positive aspects, to make people understand that everything is well -- that all is well, but I would like you to look at the results of all this, when organisations were given such and such names.  

Now, regarding the points raised by Mr. Robinson, he was happy to raise only the positive aspects, but he didn't want to look into what had been said in the previous paragraphs.  He didn't want to ask his colleagues what that meant, what the revolution of 1959 meant.  

I would like to ask the President to tell the interpreter to say that Robinson needed to address himself to his clients, not his colleagues -- because his colleagues are that lady and the other persons working with him, so I was referring to the team of counsel -- because those people were not there in 1959.  If you were to speak about colleagues, it would seem that the interpreter made a mistake.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, this is the interpreters speaking.  We interpreted correctly what the witness said.  Maybe he, himself, forgot the term that he used, because this can happen.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
He said that he referred to "clients," but the word used by the witness in Kinyarwanda was "bagenzi" (phonetic), meaning colleagues.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, let's just move on to the next question.  And what I'm asking you is essentially what you've been addressing.  I'm asking you now, did the MRND, in practice, live up to the ideals expressed in its statutes?  
A.	Can you explain to me further -- can you reformulate?  I think I understand the question, but I'm not quite sure.  Could you kindly reformulate that question, Mr. Prosecutor?  
Q.	Yes.  My question is, did the MRND, in 1991, 1992, and 1993, when you were a member -- or were an adult in Kigali and could observe what was going on on the ground, based on your observations, did the MRND party, in practice, in the way that they actually conducted their affairs, live up to that -- live up to the ideals that were expressed in its statute?  And when I say that, I'm referring to the ideals that were brought out in cross-examination a few days ago, the good things about the MRND.  In practice, did it live up to the expectations of the good things that were said in its statutes?  
A.	Yes.  The MRND implemented the ideas of 1959, but as for the ideals that Mr. Robinson mentioned by saying that the MRND did not discriminate on regional or other grounds, including ethnic grounds, if we were to look at the reality, if we go to the ground, as you said -- you've just asked me what happened on the ground because that's what I was trying to explain to you -- so on the ground, people were killed.  This means that the heritage of 1959 was implemented.  Briefly that's my answer.  
Q.	When we examined the MRND statutes during your cross-examination, we also considered Article 61, which defines -- or makes a distinction between an integrated organisation of the party, as opposed to an affiliated organisation.  And you were asked the question, if the Interahamwe or if the JMRD -- if the JMRND was either integrated to the party or affiliated to the party, because there were two separate provisions in the statute schéma.  Practically speaking, based on what you could observe about the Interahamwe and its relationship to the party leadership, the executive bureau, does it make any difference, from what you were able to observe, whether you characterised the Interahamwe as an integrated organisation or an affiliated organisation?  
A.	The Interahamwe were established within the MRND itself.  It's not a creation which came from elsewhere.  It's not a foreign creation, and I explained this when I resigned.  I didn't know that I was going to be asked these questions when I was resigning from that party.  I didn't know that I was going to be asked those questions.  I didn't know that even those procedures existed.  I based myself on what I was seeing, on my observations.  As for the Interahamwe, it's an internal organ of the MRND party.  When you're talking about an affiliated body, it's like Asestra (phonetic) or URAMA, which were organisations that were affiliated to that party.  But as for the Interahamwe, it was an internal -- an integral part of the MRND, and that is why that organisation was so powerful.  If we were dealing with another foreign organisation, foreign to the MRND, it wouldn't have been as powerful.  And that is why Mathieu Ngirumpatse said that the youth of the MRND would henceforth be known as JMRND.  That's the youth of the party.  So if you look at the situation and you see the composition of the Interahamwe who received positions or postings for having been Interahamwe, these were not young people.  These were people of a certain age.  So this was an organisation which was an integral part of the MRND.  That is reality.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, based on what you were able to observe in 1993 and 1992, who controlled the Interahamwe organisation?  
A.	I have said this.  I've already explained that, but since you are asking me questions, in re-examination, it's necessary for me to repeat the answer.  The person who controlled all the activities of the MRND on a day-to-day basis received a salary, and the salary was fixed -- a fixed amount, but I do not know how much it was.  The national secretary of the MRND coordinated all the activities of the MRND, as well as its other activities.  Who was the secretary-general of the MRND at the time?  Wasn't it Mathieu Ngirumpatse?  Furthermore, as I have already explained, that is why he was promoted to the position of secretary-general of the MRND at the highest level because he had established the youth of the MRND.  

He was opposed to Karemera and the other individuals, but since they were not as influential, they were not appointed to that position.  I'm talking about things that I know, and I'm not inventing anything.  So it was Mathieu Ngirumpatse -- Ngirumpatse who was coordinating all these activities.  
Q.	When we think back to the demonstrations that you've described that took place on the 28th of May 1992, you described certain violent acts committed by the Interahamwe on that date.  Based on your observations, were those acts, the violence, committed by the Interahamwe, in any way encouraged or tolerated by the MRND party leadership?  
A.	I do understand the question being put to me by the Prosecutor, but maybe you can repeat it for me so that I can understand it even better.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, you may repeat the question, but I just wanted to ask if you are trying to make me look bad after I complimented you on your time management earlier.  
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.  We'll move on.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Okay.  Mr. Witness, at one point in your cross-examination, you described the creation of the CDR as part of the MRND strategy.  Can you tell us what the CDR was and what you meant when you said that?  
A.	The MRND used a large number of strategies in its working methods, and this was so that the accomplishments of the 1959 revolution be implemented.  Just a while ago, you asked me a question, but you didn't repeat it.  I was going to use that opportunity to answer to the question that I had put to me on the CDR.  I had gone into the logic of that question, but suddenly you went into the question concerning the CDR.  Can you repeat the previous question so that I can answer the two questions in the same orientation?  Because that was a strategy that the MRND used.  
Q.	All right.  I had moved on to the next question because you had stated you felt you had already responded to my question.  So I was simply trying to move things along, but we can go back to it because what I was asking you is, the violence that took place on the 28th of May 1992, when there were those demonstrations in Kigali, you had described violent acts being committed by the Interahamwe; and my question to you was based on what you could perceive at the time and in the aftermath.  Were those violent acts either encouraged or tolerated by the leaders of the MRND party?  And here I'm referring to the national secretary, Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  So to what extent, based on your observations, was the violence tolerated or encouraged by the party leadership?  
A.	These acts of violence were somewhat blessed -- or received the blessing of Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  They didn't -- he didn't do enough, and he didn't hurry up in writing the letter to which I referred by saying that those acts of violence had been incited by Mugenzi and the PL.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse never condemned the acts committed by the youth of the MRND and the Interahamwe.  That is why he, therefore, gave his blessing to the acts of the Interahamwe in collaboration with the other leaders of the MRND, with whom they had the same programme.  

Now, coming to the CDR, I would like to explain to you -- 
Q.	We're going to get to the CDR.  I just want to take one moment to address one other issue, because you've mentioned in the past the publication Isibo.  Can you tell us what -- who published Isibo and what type of publication it was?  You mentioned that your letter of resignation and other types of articles were published in Isibo.  
A.	In the issues published by the Isibo newspaper, I remember that mention was made about the acts of violence committed by the Interahamwe in an article which appeared in that issue.  It was also said at that time that the MRND had been mistaken by electing Mathieu Ngirumpatse to the post of national secretary-general because he was an extremist.  So it was he who had established the Interahamwe of the MRND as an organisation after his speech in which he stated that all the youths of the MRND had, from henceforth, become Interahamwe.  It was from then on that the newspaper Isibo published that article mentioning events which had occurred.  That's what happened.  
Q.	Was there any difference between the way Isibo described the events of the 28th of May 1992 and the way Mathieu Ngirumpatse described it in his MRND communiqué? 
A.	Listen, there's a great difference between the two accounts of the facts, because Mathieu Ngirumpatse wanted to see himself blameless as well as the Interahamwe, and he wanted to shift the responsibility or shift the blame onto the -- the Parti libéral, the PL.  And Mugenzi, who was then his enemy, if you read the letter, and given the ideology of 1959, Mugenzi then understood that he had to associate himself with Mathieu Ngirumpatse in order to accomplish that plan.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I have an item that I'd like to have displayed to the witness.  This is a publication of Isibo, of which I've provided copies to the Defence earlier this morning, and I can provide copies to the Court as well now.  It exists in -- in French translation only.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, if you direct your attention to the second page of that document on the lower half -- and here I'm referring to a page that has a K-number K0013371 -- is this the article that you were referring to earlier?  
A.	Yes, that is the article from Isibo.  
Q.	And if you could summarise in two sentences the description of the events of 28th of May 1992, provided by Isibo, very briefly.  
A.	You want me to be brief?  
Q.	Yes.  
A.	Is that your intent?  
Q.	Yes.  
A.	Very briefly, mention is made of acts of violence committed by the Interahamwe, and there is also mention made of the person who encouraged those Interahamwe to commit those acts of violence, in other words, Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  
Q.	All right.  
A.	And I, in fact, explained that of late.  I explained the way in which people were killed at Sofairwa (phonetic).  I do not remember exactly how the events occurred, but I've just read about it in this document.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, at this time I'd like to move this item into evidence.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, we object to the admission of a news article, which is essentially a propaganda by a party newspaper.  We don't think that it's relevant or reliable to anything.  If there was some kind of quotation from some person, official, or something like that, a newspaper article might have some relevance, but just like chatter on the broadcast by journalists, as opposed to the speech by an official, we're objecting to those as well, and I think this would fall into the same category.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, this is essentially a question of the weight to be given to the exhibit, not to its admissibility.  If you recall, on cross-examination, we placed into evidence an item for which we didn't even know the content because it was in Kinyarwanda, and it was simply in the witness's possession.  So no one even knows the content of that other item.  And these are all items that Mr. Robinson claimed would go to the issue of counterallegations concerning this event on the 28th of May.  So it's in that context that it is offered for -- that this is offered in evidence, and it's left to the Court to appreciate the weight to give it in relation to the testimony of this witness or any other witness.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, in the interest of Mr. Ngirumpatse, I would like to add an observation.  Given what Mr. Robinson has said about the weight given to this article, given that this is an article from an opposition newspaper whose credibility is doubtful, in the manner in which the incident is reported, and this is to aid you in your reflections, and to be more specific, this is a newspaper, which is for -- pro-MDR.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We think it's a matter of weight.  We have, in fact, been admitting reports, and we will have to assess the weight to be attached to the reports in due course.  So we will admit it as the other (inaudible) was admitted.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm not sure of the number, but I'll simply rely on Mr. Fry to sort that out.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What's the exhibit number, Mr. Fry?  
MR. FRY:
P. 18, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
P. 18. 
(Exhibit No. P. 18 admitted)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much longer are you going to be?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Five minutes.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you've mentioned the name of Mathieu Ngirumpatse quite a bit.  In fact, most of your testimony has been directed toward Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Do you have any personal dislike for Mathieu Ngirumpatse that would lead you to falsely accuse him of responsibility for the events of 1994?  
A.	Not at all.  I have no problem with Mathieu.  I have no problem with him.  He is here in the courtroom, and I have no problem whatsoever with him.  Furthermore, I don't even have any problem in my mind with him.  I'm speaking to you, and I'm saying the truth about what he did.

1535H
THE WITNESS: (Continued)
Nzirorera is seated here.  Why have I not spoken about him?  The simple reason is that I never lived with him.  I spoke of Joseph Nzirorera insofar as I knew him and I remember that there was a newspaper in which an article appeared on Joseph Nzirorera regarding the tarmacked roads.  And there was a cartoon of Joseph Nzirorera who was swallowing all the roads, so the intent was that -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
Just so that we don't prolong our day, I'm objecting to the answer. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, Mr. Witness, the question was asked only about whether your feelings for Mr. Ngirumpatse might cause you to falsely accuse him.  You should confine your answer to that question. 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, you are right in what you're saying.  That is why, in my answer, I must tell you the truth.  I have answered the question which was put to me, but in answering that question, I want to bring out the truth.  Because if I do not do so, and if you stop me from doing that, I would somehow be frustrated.  Otherwise I have answered the question, and when Robinson stood up, I thought that he was thinking that I was going to accuse his client.  But that's not true.  I answered you given what I know of as being the truth of the events.  That's what I have to say, Mr. President. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I have no further questions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.

Now, Mr. Witness, you have given evidence before this Court for quite a long time, and I would simply like to thank you for your attendance, and for your participation in these proceedings.  

The ancillary issues which you have raised are no longer a matter for the Trial Chamber in this case.  The appropriate authorities I mentioned to you to whom they should be addressed is the registrar, and Mr. Fry, who is the representative of the registrar in these proceedings, is authorised to assist you in the furtherance of answers to the questions you have raised.  So thank you very much, and you are now permitted to leave. 
THE WITNESS:
I cannot take leave of you without saying a word.  First of all, I do apologise to you for any digressions on my part.  Sometimes, and on those various occasions, you have made remarks to me, and I am also asking pardon from the interpreters because at certain moments I maybe digressed.  And I would wish, particularly, to thank all the parties for the collaboration that we have enjoyed, although our job was not easy.  

Other than that, I will request the registrar to find a solution to my problems, and I would wish that this be implemented.  I wouldn't wish that, at the end of my testimony, you leave me to my own devices.  I wish briefly to come back to what you referred to as WVSS, the victim -- the witness and victims' services section. 

If possible, I would wish that you speak to some employees of that section.  I even wrote a letter to that effect.  You know, protecting witnesses does not mean threatening them.  The employees of that section are paid for that.  That is why, in my conclusion, I am requesting you to kindly speak to the employees of this section in order to facilitate our task, because that is what they are there for and that is what they are paid to do. 

I'm going to soon go back home to Rwanda, but I know that if I were to depend on the WVSS, they are going to tell me that, "You have refused to remain a protected witness, and you refuse to remain in the safe house."  In fact, I received a letter full of lies.  That letter states that I intended to obtain money and then leave.  Why did I not leave?  I could have taken a vehicle and left, and even left my passport behind. 

I have other problems, but I wouldn't wish to complicate the Judges of this Chamber.  I wouldn't want to complicate their task -- their task.  My life is in danger.  I wanted to provide explanations in that regard, but given the fact that the Chamber's time is limited, and as you have asked Mr. Christopher Fry to help me, I'm going to contact him and I believe he will help me. 

This is what I had to say.  Goodbye, and may the peace of God be with you.  
(Witness excused at 1545H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before we adjourn, there is just a brief addendum to the status conference (unintelligible) -- the matter raised by Mr. Weyl.  

Mr. Weyl, we have found the -- we have found the reference in your response to the pre-trial brief, but normally we would have considered it as a pre-trial brief under rule 73 bis, not a motion under rule 73, and there would not normally be any reason for us to have considered it, or considered issuing an order or any decision under the basis of that.  But since you raised the matter in open Court, I thought that there would be a few comments that we should make, very briefly. 

We noted that you did not submit any legal basis for your request, but what we think is that we have ruled on similar issues in a number of previous decisions, and I can refer you briefly to the decision of 23rd February 2005 denying request for cooperation of France; the decision of 31st March 2005 denying certification to appeal the decision of the 23rd of February 2005; and the decision of 5th July 2005 on Nzirorera's motion to compel inspection disclosure.  And in that decision, and in paragraph 12, it specifically addresses the matter which arose.  So we don't think that, apart from the technical point that I mentioned initially, we don't think that on the merits of your application that there is any need for us to do anything further with regard to it.  So that will be the response that I give you on this matter. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, would you allow me to make an observation?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Certainly. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I do recall the decisions that you have rendered, and the time when they were rendered, but our observations dealt with a new legal situation borne out of the brief by the -- filed by the Prosecutor, and the indications in that brief which dealt with specific factual matters dealing with an accident, and other factual information about -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Mr. President, maybe it's the late hour, but I'm completely lost.  Could Counsel please recommence?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, the interpreter has requested that you repeat yourself.  There is a problem. 
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Mr. President.  I was saying that I remembered the decisions that you have rendered on the issue concerning the presidential plane and the crash, but there is a new legal situation, that is, a brief from the Prosecution after you rendered your decisions.  And this brief deals with a series of factual indications, one of which deals with an accident, and this deals with happenstance, and we believe that when the Prosecutor is talking about happenstance and an accident, this is not done on purpose.  He is doing this on the basis of information that he has in his possession to enable him to speak about an accident, happenstance.  

Now, the Prosecution mentioned in his brief a second series of factual circumstances which are quite different and that was an attack on the presidential plane.  And we are convinced that, when the Prosecutor uses a term in his pre-trial brief, this is done with full awareness of the consequences.  

So when he talks about an attack on the presidential plane, we believe that he mentioned this and circumstances which are not circumstantial, but the fruits of intent; we are believing that he is doing so because of a report that he has.  

We do not know how the Prosecutor can have two different views without having any premise, and given this new legal situation, there -- from his pre-trial brief which he filed before you rendered your decisions, we want him to provide us with this information which led him to have these two different assessments, one which is due from a series of circumstances which are factual, pertaining to an accident, and the other, the confirmation of an attack.  

The two are irreconcilable and I don't think that the Prosecutor could have filed pre-trial brief without having had new information, and we believe he needs to share this information.  And this is the basis of our motion, and we believe that you rendered your decisions under different judicial circumstances than what has appeared now, and we are therefore requesting you to review your decisions, Mr. President.  Your Honour, I thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, we have decided that our response at this stage would be to take note of the remarks that you have made.  It is now 4 o'clock, we are going to be closing our trial session and we do not think we should open this matter any further at this time.  But we have taken note of what you have said.
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. WEBSTER:
(Microphones overlapping)  I participated in the drafting of that pre-trial brief, and if I am relying on Mr. Weyl's characterisation on the language when it says "accident" and "the shooting down".  But I can assure you that we have just paraphrased the way witnesses talk about this event, and it was only mentioned as an event.  There is no report that supports one characterisation or the other. 

Actually, I defer to the French in this regard because most of the witness statements that we have in our office refer to an "accident", (French spoken), and we simply use those terms interchangeably for reasons of drafting style.  It has nothing to do with any sort of legal determination or historical -- it is nothing to do with an investigation.  It is simply prose form.  That's it.  

But I would like to take this opportunity to thank the registry, particularly Mr. Fry, who has been very patient with us in handling all this documentation.  And, once again, to thank the language section.  I know you have suffered a lot of abuse from our side and from the witness and from all the parties.  You have a very difficult job.  We sympathise with you, and we thank you for your consistent support; and to the Trial Chamber for its patience with the pace of the proceedings. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, also I wanted to thank everyone involved in this trial for its assistance to us, including the language section, the video people, and the people who are doing the transcribing and reporting, and your staff.  I also thank the Judges for their patience with me. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Hounkpatin?
MS. HOUNKPATIN:  
Thank you, Mr. President.  Following my learned friend Robinson and my learned friend Webster, I would like to thank everyone here present for the good work done, in particular the registry which has been very patient with our requirements and other demands, as well as the interpreters.  Can they pardon me for my new situation in this Tribunal.  I hope I shall soon fit in better.  I also wish to thank the stenographers.  Everyone should enjoy our thanks and let's hope that the next session will take place in better conditions and that we will make headway as has been expressed in the wishes made by the Presiding Judge.  Thank you. 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, we are at the end of this session, but still in regard to judicial economy, I would like to simply join with my colleagues in the Defence who have expressed their thanks, as well as the Office of the Prosecutor.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I must thank you all.  After those very lovely speeches, I asked Judge Short if he wished to make a speech as well, and he told me that I could simply say on his behalf that he wished everybody a happy Christmas when it comes. 

For myself, I would like to also thank the entire Court staff, registry, the translators, the court reporters and all of the other staff who have assisted in our work. 

I would also like to thank counsel in the matter.  I think that everybody has worked towards assisting in the administration of justice in an effective manner.  I suspect that I can reveal one of my eccentricities and commend that my major frustration was the slow pace of the proceedings.  But I hope that now we have got into the case itself, that we will be able to improve the rate of process in the next trial session.  So with that, I will again say thanks to everybody and wish you all the best as we close the trial session, the first trial session for this case, and look forward to resumption next year.  We can take the recess now. 
(Court adjourned at 1700H)
