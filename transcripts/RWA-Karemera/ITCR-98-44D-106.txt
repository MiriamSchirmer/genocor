P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. MJUI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, Presiding, Judge Francis Emile Short (sic), and 
Judge Gberdao G. Kam, absent, is now sitting in open session, today, Tuesday 16 May 2006 for continuation of Trial Chamber in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case Number ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Can I simply say that the appearances are the same?  Thank you.  

Mr. Webster, do you want to resume in closed session?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, Your Honour.  I don't think it should take more than 15 minutes or so, and then we can go into open session. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, if I can just make a few points in open session, just very quickly.  First of all, I would just want to note on the record my objection to continuing the proceeding in the absence of Judge Kam and in the absence of a decision on our preliminary motion.  

Secondly, with respect to the timing of a cross -- of the direct and cross-examination, I just wanted to point out something, that when we received -- when we were discussing this amongst the parties with your coordinator, she asked us to give time estimates for Witness ZF.  And Mr. Webster referred her, and all of us, to his previous submission he had made before the -- or at the end of the second trial session.  And that didn't have any actual time estimate for Witness ZF because he was a reserved witness at that time.  So, when I made my estimate I went back to the pre-trial brief and I saw that there were six hours of direct examination of Witness ZF.  So, I estimated -- I thought that he would be one day for the Prosecution.  And I thought, giving you general guidelines, it would be three days for the Defence, and so I estimated that I could take two of them since I am leading the cross-examination.  

And now I see that somehow there was some communication between the Prosecutor and the         Trial Chamber that there was going to be two days of direct examination, which I wasn't aware of.  I don't have any problem with that, but I think my estimate is probably more close to four days for cross-examination than two as a result of that.  I'm still -- it is still possible that I could finish in two because I don't see -- my outline is that long for this witness, but I want to reserve four days.  And then if it turns out that I can do it in two, then that is good.  But I just want to let you know that my estimate is different than what you have in front of you, being the reasons for that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take note of your comments.  I don't think it is necessary to say anything at this stage.  

I just should have put on the record that we continue to sit under 15 bis.  We expect that that should end at the mid-morning break when Judge Kam will return.

We -- Mr. Witness --  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Actually, before we go into closed session, let me just clarify one thing for the record for Mr. Robinson.  Every communication that I have made concerning scheduling has been copied to all parties, including the Trial Chamber.  So, indeed, I know that I recall having sent an e-mail to the coordinator, which I believe was copied to everyone, where I indicated that the witness would testify for approximately     two days.  I don't know what date; I don't have a copy of it in front of me.  But clearly everything concerning this trial and concerning scheduling is always copied to all parties when I communicate with the Trial Chamber coordinator. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for that clarification, Mr. Webster.  I still don't think it necessary to say anything at this stage, but we have noted the comments and we will see how we can best proceed from here on.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I don't think it is going to be a problem. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  

Now, Mr. Witness, your testimony resumes this morning.  You are under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began yesterday; do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
I understand you full well, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good, thank you.  Now, yesterday you were being examined in a closed session, and that examination will continue in closed session for another 15 minutes or so this morning.  So, we now resume in closed session, which should last for approximately 15 to 20 minutes.

BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right, Mr. Witness, I would like you to begin by explaining what did you mean by zero network.  Does that -- could you explain the zero network to us, please? 
A.	I'm sorry, Mr. Prosecutor, I can't hear very well.  I think there is a problem.  I did not understand the French translation.   
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I think the witness is asking for the question to be repeated.  Excuse me, he says he didn't grasp it.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
There is also perhaps something wrong with his headset.  Issa, can you check his headset. 
THE WITNESS:
Now I can hear clearly. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  Can you begin by telling us, or explaining to us your understanding of the zero network?  Did that have a meaning beyond the -- anything to do with radio communication? 
A.	Well, Mr. Prosecutor, the réseau zéro was a telecom network that consisted of traffic between a group of people who knew each other well.  But from what I heard at the officer's mess and from the radio operator himself in our discussions, it was said that that network was used by the people in the president's inner circle, from his entourage.  And those people would call -- we had names for them.  It depends on exactly when, because we were in Gisenyi for quite some time, approximately four years and some names changed.  Sometimes we called them the Abakozi, the workers. And sometimes we called them dragons.  And that network was a secret network where there was communications and traffic between those people who were around Habyarimana; people he trusted, who could say things, discuss things with other people, where the members of the government or politicians in general should not follow.  
MR. WEBSTER:
For the record, Abakozi is on the spelling list as number 1. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, was Akazu one of the terms that you would use with regard to this zero network? 
A.	Akazu was a name sometime before, not in use in the period when I was already working for the army.  Well before then we would speak of the Akazu, which meant the presidential circle.  His confidants, he himself and the people -- confidants.  People in general would speak of Akazu.  We would say that President Habyarimana had his -- the people he trusted, that he preferred his favourites, a sort of nepotism.  And those people who were around him, and with whom he could discuss highly confidential matters, those people constituted what we called the Akazu.  Akazu in French, you would say a little house, a very little house; a hut, let us say. 
Q.	To the best of your knowledge, was there any overlap between those who you regarded as the Akazu, and those that you learned or understood to be members of the zero network or the Abakozi?  Was there any relationship between those groupings, or what was the relationship between those groupings? 
A.	It was a relationship, but it wasn't quite the same thing because at the outset, the Akazu,, the Akazu was a network, not only a network, it was an organisation.  One could say it was a sort of intimacy that existed among a small group of people who came from the same part of the country, especially from Ruhengeri, Gisenyi and -- people who Habyarimana and his advisors trusted.  

And then a bit later during the war, he didn't need only the people from his home area from -- and from Ruhengeri, he also needed people whom he considered to be trustworthy from other regions in the country, and all of those people that were supposed to run the civil service apparatus, the administrative apparatus that ran the country.  So you could no longer speak of Akazu, so one spoke of the dragons.  And I don't know what they called them in other places.  But where I was, with the officers at the mess and the people that I frequented in Gisenyi, we used the term Abakozi and the term dragon, which was now -- which now consisted of all of the people who were in positions throughout the country, and whom Habyarimana trusted.  And the relationship between Akazu and the dragons is that it was people who -- in whom Habyarimana had confidence, but the extent of that association was no longer the same. 
Q.	Would you be able to identify some of the persons that you understood to be members of the Abakozi or the dragon? 
A.	Well, Mr. Prosecutor, if I remember correctly I'd begin on the civilian side, certain people whose names were mentioned, given to us each time there was a change.  There was also a change of names in the list.  And the most important that I still remember until today on the civilian side -- 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, excuse me.  I have an objection.  I thought the witness would just be answering yes or no to that question but he seems to be beginning to give the list of names.  And I have an objection I would like to make and if the witness could be asked to remove his headset.  First of all, if we can ask the witness whether or not he understands English. 
THE WITNESS:
I do understand, but it is very little. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  If we could ask the witness then to leave the courtroom for a few minutes while we take up my objection. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
How much time are you going to take for this, Mr. Robinson?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
My own -- what I have to say can take about three minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  What I am thinking is that we can -- we could excuse the witness for the morning break now, because we also have a decision on certification which I can deliver before we take the adjournment.

Mr. Witness, we take a mid-morning break, it is usually at about 10:30, but we are going to start your break now and you will be recalled when we are ready to resume our sitting.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
(Witness exited courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, my objection is two-fold to the admission of evidence of those persons who were part of the zero network, the telecommunications network, which I anticipate the witness will include             Mr. Nzirorera in that list.  

My first objection is on the grounds that such an allegation is not contained in the indictment.  And, therefore, we have not been charged with being a participant in a telecommunication network, the object of which was ostensibly to be part of the conspiracy to exterminate Tutsi.  So, on that basis we believe that the evidence should be excluded.  

Secondly, pursuant to Rule 89(C), we believe that the evidence, the source of the evidence from this witness is not reliable enough to be admitted as -- or have any probative value.  He is simply going to repeat gossip that he heard at the officers` mess.  We don't think that that is sufficiently probative that it should be admitted.  So, on those grounds, we asked that the witness not be allowed to provide the names of those the people who were members of the zero network.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
For the last part of the objection, Rule 89 gives the Court broad discretion to admit evidence that it may determine to be probative.  Mr. Robinson's objection is not to the admissibility of the evidence, it is really to the weight of the evidence.  This Chamber can consider this witness's testimony in context of all of the evidence that it hears in this case.  And, at the conclusion of all of the evidence, can decide what weight to give this particular piece of information.  So I don't think it is appropriate to exclude this portion of the witness's testimony under Rule 89.  
In fact, Rule 89 is a wide opening for all sorts of information which this Chamber can then decide if to give it any weight or to give it admissibility when it is deliberating on the case in its final stage.  

As for the first portion, there was adequate notice of this information.  It is in all of his witness statements.  His earliest witness statement is from 1998.  And there have been a number of disclosures where this information was placed at the disposal of the Defence.  As for the information itself, it need not be pleaded in the indictment.  There is nothing criminal, per se, about being part of an radio network or a group of people.  The charge is conspiracy, and this may be one fact that we use in our argument to allege or to ask the Court to draw inferences of conspiracy, but being a member of a radio network is not a crime per se.  So, it need not be pleaded in the indictment.  But clearly in the pre-trial brief, I can't refer to a specific paragraph now, but in all of the discussions in this case, there have been constant reference to the Akazu, to a group of politicians that worked hand in hand with President Habyarimana and his circle to plan genocide in Rwanda.  This is not the type of information that should be excluded.  It need not be pleaded in the indictment.  And on that basis, I'm asking this Court to allow us to proceed and to move forward. 
(Pages 16 to 19 by Donna M. Lewis)






















1030H 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if I could just be heard briefly in reply, especially with respect to the issue of the indictment.  The question for the Chamber is whether the existence and participation by the Accused in a communications network, the object of which is to facilitate the object of the joint criminal enterprise, is a material fact that has to be pleaded in the indictment.  We believe it is.  Material facts need not be criminal; attendance at meetings, other things like that are plead as material facts, and you have held that they are required to be plead as material facts.  We think that the participation at such a radio communications network is a material fact.  

Now, if a material fact is not in the indictment, it's true that -- well, first of all the indictment becomes defective.  However, the defective indictment can be cured by adequate notice, but then the jurisprudence is that that notice is not provided by witness statements.  And Mr. Webster's correct that this is in the witness statements of the witnesses, no doubt about that.  But the jurisprudence is that the notice has to come either directly from the pre-trial brief, or the opening statement, or some other form of formal pleading, not in the hundreds or thousands of pages of witness statements that are disclosed to the Defence.  We don't believe that that defect in the indictment has been cured.  

So that's our submission on that, thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Are there any other submissions on this issue?  

Okay, there being no other submissions, we will think about it, hopefully during the break.  

We are ready to deliver our decision on the oral motion made yesterday, that's on the 15th of May, moving the Court to certify for appeal the oral decision that we made yesterday, ordering Witness ZF to testify under his pseudonym and not under his true name, as requested by the Defence for Nzirorera.  The Defence for Ngirumpatse joined in the application for certification, and the Prosecutor opposed the motion.  

Rule 73(B) provides that decisions rendered under Rule 73 motions are without interlocutory appeal except with the Chamber's discretion, and for very limited circumstances.  Certification to appeal may be granted if both conditions stipulated by Rule 73(B) are satisfied.  The applicant must show how the impugned decision involves an issue that would significantly affect a fair and expeditious conduct of the proceedings, or the outcome of the trial.  And, that an immediate resolution by the Appeals Chamber may materially advance the proceedings.  

The Chamber considers that the two conditions set out above are cumulative, and an applicant needs to satisfy both of them in order for the Chamber to exercise its discretion in favour of certification.  

The Defence for Joseph Nzirorera argues that whether a witness testifies under pseudonym, or under his true name, has an impact on the fairness of the proceedings.  If he uses his pseudonym (sic), people who will be aware of his testimony can contact the Prosecutor, the Chamber, or the Defence, to tell them if something is wrong in the testimony.  

The Chamber recalls that its decision of 10th December 2004 contains a justification for which Witness ZF need not testify under his true name.  On the basis of the submissions filed by the Prosecutor, the Chamber found that the issue of pseudonym was necessary in order to safeguard the witness' security.  The Defence is in possession of all the identifying information relating to Witness ZF and the other individuals who would be called to testify in the Prosecution case.  The Defence is also able to challenge allegations which are made by Witness ZF during his testimony in Court.  

It's the Chamber's view that the fairness of the proceedings is satisfied.  Consequently, the Chamber notes that the Defence counsel has failed to show how the impugned decision involves an issue that would significantly affect a fair and expeditious conduct of the proceedings.  

The Defence also argues that the Chamber should have specific information before ordering the witness to testify under pseudonym.  It argues that the resolution of this argument by the Appeal Chamber may materially advance the proceedings, as this is an issue which may arise for other witnesses in the future.  

The Chamber's of the view that the Defence has failed to show that an immediate resolution with the Appeals Chamber of this issue is likely to materially advance the proceedings, and therefore the second criteria for certification has also not been met.  

Now, for these reasons the Defence motion is denied.  

I think we will -- we will take the mid-morning break now.  
(Court recessed from 1035H to 1109H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I'm pleased to announce that the Bench is back at full strength, and Judge Kam has rejoined the Bench, and will continue with our sitting.  
JUDGE SHORT: 
Mr. Robinson, aren't you going to welcome Judge Kam?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I'm sorry, Judge Short, I'm just working with some new equipment.  I didn't hear you.  
JUDGE SHORT: 
I said, are you not going to welcome Judge Kam?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I did want to welcome Judge Kam, and thank you very much for giving me that introduction.  

And Judge Kam -- Judge Kam, I wanted to address a remark to you (unintelligible).  Thank you for coming back so quickly from your leave, and we appreciate the effort you made to do that.  And we think it's very important that we have all -- participation of all three Judges in Mr. Nzirorera's trial.  

I want you to know yesterday I objected to a proceeding in your absence, and I insisted the Presiding Judge made a record of the reasons for your absence.  I want you to know I didn't do so with any intention to invade your privacy, but to ensure accountability for all participants in the trial of Mr. Nzirorera.  So I just wanted to let you know that.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
With regard to the objection to the question raised by counsel for Nzirorera, we think that the material, that the information sought, is not material facts.  

We think, however, Mr. Webster, that you could approach it differently.  And by just starting to deliver this witness' testimony in a more direct fashion, and from that the information that you sought will automatically emerge.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we left off with a question.  I was asking you about the zero -- the -- I've been asked by the -- the interpretation booth to be consistent in how we use some of the terms in this case.  And for "zero network", I will refer to it now as the réseau zero, because that's the way it comes through consistently in the documentation.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And how is that supposed to be written in the English transcript?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
With a French spelling.  R-E-S-E-A-U space Z-E-R-O.  So it would be like rendezvous, which is a French word, but we all understand in English.  So réseau zero would work in the same way.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell us some of the names that you associated with the réseau zero?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, when I referred to the réseau zero, I was referring to a communication network which was used by a group of people, and those people had names which I had given you, and these names were being mentioned among the officers that I interacted with, and with those I worked with in Gisenyi, and even in the army.  So that réseau zero, which was used by the dragons, who was also referred to as the Abakozi at times.  Because this covered a period, a long period, going from 1991, up until 1994.  

And if you want the names of these people, I will say first -- the first -- those who were leaders of that group were those who were closest to the President Habyarimana, and who were members of the dragon network, and they used the réseau zero.  

And then there's the MRND.  The names that were most frequently mentioned from among the MRND members, at least in the environment that I worked, was Ngirumpatse, Mathieu, Nzirorera, Joseph.  There was also a political party which was affiliated -- or a sister party to the MRND.  In the beginning it was just one cell, but it became a party in its own right, and it was called the CDR.  And those who were most frequently mentioned in that party were Bucyana, Martin, and Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza.  

There were other people in the civil service, and others in the political arena generally whose name I recall.  There were some ministers, such as Bizimungu, Casimir; there was Augustin Bizimana.  There was some préfet from the préfectures, such as Côme Bizimungu, there was Protais Zigiranyirazo, normally referred to as Z, there was Kayishema, there was Bagambiki.  

There were communal bourgmestre as well, and the most influential ones were Gatete, Murambi and Byumba communes, Kajelijeli, Mukingo of Ruhengeri.  There were the bourgmestres,
Semanza, Nsengimana; there was Karera.  There were some business people, such as Kabuga, Félicien, and Froduald Karamira.  

There were the national leaders of the militia group Interahamwe, and that was the MRND militia, and there was Robert Kajuga.  He was the national leader of the Interahamwe militia.  And there was Umweza (phonetic), who was his deputy.  There were other people who were more influential in the Abakozi group -- Abakozi and dragon groups, such as Nahimana, there was one Léon Mugesera, there was Habiyambere, Joseph.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, that should -- I'm sorry, did I interrupt you?  Continue.  Were you about to say something?  
A.	No, Mr. Prosecutor, I was just thinking, to try and recall the names.  
Q.	We will come back to some of these names during the course of your testimony, but this is enough for right now.  You mentioned the names Joseph Nzirorera and Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and I'm wondering if you could tell us if you know Mr. Nzirorera and where you know him from?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, Joseph Nzirorera at one point in time was the minister of public works.  At that time I was also a civil servant in the (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and placed under seal).  ************************************************, and I could see him.  That's the minister.  Later on I saw him in Gisenyi during his many visits.  
Q.	And when you say "his many visits", could you give us some additional detail, please?  To the extent that you know, can you tell us what he was doing in Gisenyi on the times that you would see him?  And, if it's possible, give us an estimation of the number of times you've seen him in Gisenyi, and over what period of time.  If you can limit it in time by giving us a year, or a portion of a year.  We're trying to understand how you come to know Mr. Nzirorera.  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I saw him in Gisenyi the first time in 1992 at point A, and in 1994, after the 6th of April, I saw him on two occasions at the AR camp, ops Gisenyi. 
Q.	Are you suggesting that both of -- that both times that you saw him in 1994 was at ops camp?  
A.	Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	On these occasions when you saw him, did you have an opportunity to speak to him, or did he speak to you personally?  
A.	After the 6th of April, when he came to the Gisenyi ops camp, he spoke to me.  And when we met again, after the 6th of April, he spoke to me again.  He spoke to me, and we had a chat for a while.  
Q.	Do you know if Mr. Nzirorera had any particular status with the MRND party?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I don't quite know exactly what he was doing within the party, but in my own environment, that is, the officers' mess and the work environment in Gisenyi, through the same Lieutenant Bizumuremyi, who was the coordinator of the Interahamwe militia, I got to know that it -- that Nzirorera was probably vice-president of the MRND at the national level, and president of the Interahamwe in the Ruhengeri préfecture.  
Q.	If we turn our attention to Ngirumpatse now.  Can you explain to the Court if you know him, and how you came to know him, and what occasions you saw him during the period 1990 to 1994?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, prior to the 6th of April, the period between -- from 1992 to 1993, I believe I saw him on two occasions in the Gisenyi préfecture, and on both occasions I saw him at the MRND palace.  He came there to hold a meeting in the MRND palace.  And he was saying that he was the national president of the MRND, and he invited the préfet, the sous-préfet, the bourgmestre, the leaders of the militia, and heads of préfecture departments to a meeting at the MRND palace.  I, myself, was not present, even though ************************, but since I had already started working at the ********-- I was told that, during the first meeting of Ngirumpatse at the MRND palace, they discussed the conduct of the Interahamwe militia in the Gisenyi préfecture, their discipline, their support, their support to the Rwandan armed forces, and also, more specifically, to the Gisenyi gendarme.  It was about the same thing for the second meeting that he led at the MRND palace, and on that occasion it was towards the end of 1993.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, I would like to object to this testimony and ask that it be stricken.  These meetings of Mr. Ngirumpatse in Gisenyi appear absolutely nowhere in the indictment, pre-trial brief, the disclosure.  This is the first that we're hearing of this, and certainly you've already held that meetings are material facts, especially large gatherings like MRND party gatherings.  So I would ask that this be stricken.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, I believe if we look at the indictment you will see two or three paragraphs that speak, in very broad terms, about meetings organised in 1993, and there was a reference -- I believe it's paragraph 23 -- to meetings in 1992.  All of these events are in one of the witness statements, at least one -- certainly in the summary we provided for the pre-trial brief.  It's in his statement of 2004.  So, on the issue of notice, this could hardly be an issue of notice for the Defence.  The witness also has given sworn testimony in other proceedings that has covered this information as well.  So, on the issue of notice, I don't think -- my submission is that there is not a basis to object.  

To the extent -- I'm not sure if Mr. Robinson's making the same motion that he made before we broke, and when he was referring specifically to the pleadings in the indictment.  I note that he didn't mention any authority to support his position when he made his motion, and I would like to refer to the -- refer the Court to the Niyiteyeka judgment, where that Trial Chamber said that:  "Disclosure of witness statements" -- and here I put the emphasis on witness statements -- "the pretrial brief, or other materials, and the knowledge acquired during the course of the trial, may have the effect of curing any lack of notice in the indictment."  And that's the Niyiteyeka judgment at paragraph 44.  So I would think -- I would urge the Court to deny the Defence motion and allow us to proceed.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This is a legal issue, and we are professional Judges.  I think we will think about it.  But in the meantime we will permit the testimony to continue, and we will reserve our decision on its admissibility.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if I -- I was just going through my jurisprudence here, and if I can just give you some citations to the fact that disclosure of witness statements is not sufficient notice of the specific charges against him, and does not cure the indictments -- otherwise a defect in the indictment.  And my citations -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Counsel's microphone, please.  Counsel's microphone, please.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
First is the Zigiranyirazo decision on the defence preliminary motion, objecting to the form of the indictment, on 15 July 2004 at paragraph 51.  And I believe that's a decision that, Judge Byron, you were the presiding Judge in.  And it was held that:  "In order to have sufficient notice, mere disclosure in witness statements does not give the Accused sufficient notice of the specific charges against him."  And I think that -- maybe I will just leave it at that at the moment, because you can look to the authority that you yourself cited when you made that statement.  There's a series of other authority, but it would take me a few minutes to find it.  So, thank you.
  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Just to add, Your Honour, if we look at the whole suite of paragraphs, or the whole -- the paragraphs that start at paragraph 23 in the indictment and continue on 24 with a number of subparagraphs, I think those pleadings should be sufficient to put the Defence on notice of meetings.  So, we can -- I'm sure the Court will come back to this issue, and we will proceed.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will.  We will come back to it.  But I think you should proceed now, and we will give a ruling as soon as we can.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, you were in the middle of telling us about how you came to know Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  With respect to the meetings that you mentioned in 1993, during the period before the 6th of April, how did you come to learn the content of what was said during those gatherings?  
A.	The tenor of the meetings I learnt of at the officers' mess, more particularly through Lieutenant Bizumuremyi. 
Q.	Do you know if he was present for the meeting? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	And I don't recall exactly the words you used to describe what Ngirumpatse had to say about the Interahamwe, so I'm going to ask you to explain that to us again.  When you said something about the relationship between the Interahamwe and the military, can you go back over that portion of your answer and explain it to us in greater detail?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would like to note an objection to this testimony as being unreliable under Rule 89(C).  It apparently comes from information he received at the officers' mess from a particular lieutenant who is now deceased, so we have no way of confronting the veracity of this information, and ask that it be excluded.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Shall I respond to that?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You may.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
This seems to be an argument about the weight to be given to this particular portion of the testimony.  This Court can receive and has received hearsay testimony.  It will be for the Court to decide, when all of the evidence is in, or when this witness' testimony is completed, or the close of the Prosecution case, whether the broader context, and evidence from other witnesses, and evidence from this witness himself, would persuade -- additional evidence from this witness himself would persuade the Court to give an appropriate weight to his testimony on this point.  So it's not an issue of admissibility.  

Clearly Rule 89 would permit it.  The Court has discretion to admit it or to exclude it, but the Court can make that decision at the close of the evidence in this case.  It's not a decision that is appropriate to make at this juncture.  
JUDGE SHORT: 
Mr. Webster, are you going to lay a foundation for this testimony; the circumstances under which he met this lieutenant?  Do you intend laying a foundation for this kind of testimony?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, Your Honour.  I can go back to that point.  But I thought I'd spent a great deal of time yesterday explaining how he came to know the persons who provided him with their accounts of what they saw and what they heard, and here I'm referring to Bizumuremyi, who this witness described as a very close associate, ****************************************************************************************** at some point, who he spent a great deal of time with, and I think he described Bizumuremyi as the person that he was closest to in the military establishment.  Then he went on to his describe relationships with at least four or five other officers.  These are the officers that I believe he has already testified, or will testify, that he spoke with regularly in the officers' mess.  
JUDGE SHORT: 
Yeah, I agree.  But I'm referring to the circumstances under which this officer came to tell him about this particular meeting.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I can go into that now.  
JUDGE SHORT: 
Okay.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yeah, Mr. Robinson, I accept that there are two wings to your submissions; the issue of the weight, and on to the issue of legal admissibility.  But I think that in relation to both wings, there -- it's a bit early for us, I think, to rule, until we hear a bit more.  And there are other stages of the trial where this objection can be addressed.  I think that now we shall allow a little bit more evidence to be adduced on this issue before ruling on either wing.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay, I appreciate that, Mr. President.  But I just want to make it clear -- actually, I'm making no submission as to the weight to be given to this testimony -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I understand that.
MR. ROBINSON:
-- this is not the time for that.  And I do believe -- and I think Mr. Webster was incorrect when he said you can make the decisions at the end of the case concerning admissibility.  I think this is the time -- you can obviously think about it over the lunch recess, or whatever, but when evidence is being first presented, my position is that it's not sufficiently reliable to admit it in the first place.  So you don't even get to the issue of weight.  And I think Judge Short suggests that there be more foundation before he can make that decision, or before the Chamber makes that decision, and that's correct.  But I think that decision has to be made relatively contemporaneously with the admission of the evidence.  
JUDGE SHORT: 
What you are saying -- what you are saying, in effect, is that you would wait until the foundation is laid, and if necessary, you could repeat your objection at that stage.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
That's correct.  
JUDGE SHORT: 
Okay.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right, Mr. Witness, we're going to spend a bit of time discussing how you came to learn about Mathieu Ngirumpatse's presence during these gatherings at the MRND palace.  Can you tell us if you recall the specific conversation, or conversations, where Ngirumpatse's presence in Gisenyi was brought to your attention?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, Lieutenant Bizumuremyi, as I told you earlier on, was the coordinator of the Interahamwe and (inaudible) in the Gisenyi préfecture, and the Rwandan armed forces in Gisenyi.  So, all MRND activities, and its militia, were monitored by Lieutenant Bizumuremyi, who in turn reported to the ops commander -- Gisenyi ops commander.  And for that reason he obviously was present at those two meetings -- those two meetings held by Ngirumpatse.  And these were MRND meetings.  

During those meetings, Ngirumpatse spoke about the support that the Interahamwe militia had to give to the armed forces, and in particular the gendarmerie.  He also spoke about discipline among the militiamen, the Interahamwe.  

It was after that meeting, when I spoke to Lieutenant Bizumuremyi, who was present, that he recounted what went on at that meeting to me.  This is how I got to know that there were meetings.  I, personally, had to attend in the meeting in my capacity ******************************** (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal), but since I was no longer present in my office, and I was, at that time, at point A, I was curious to know what happened, and he was the one closer to me and who could give me information.  It was Lieutenant Bizumuremyi who was closest to me, and he told me what went on in those two meetings.  

Let me add that everything that went on in Gisenyi, the bi-party MRND activities, Lieutenant Bizumuremyi had to attend because he was coordinator, and the ops commander had given him the assignment to monitor those meetings and other activities, and, in fact, all of the activities of those two parties, MRND and CDR, within Gisenyi.  That was so as to be able to report to the Gisenyi ops commander.  
Q.	In your recollection, do you make any distinction between the meeting that was held in 1992 and the one that was held in 1993, in terms of the content of the meeting?  To the extent that you remember those conversations and that period, can you expand on your account of those two events?  
A.	In 1992, Mr. Prosecutor, in the second half of that year -- I don't remember the exact date -- in the latter half of the year there was a meeting that differed from that of 1993.  It took place at location A.  It was a meeting attended by both civilian and military persons of authority, and that meeting was chaired by Colonel Bagosora, Théoneste.  
Q.	I think we're misunderstanding each other a bit, Witness.  I'm still on the meetings with Ngirumpatse that you described earlier as taking place at the MRND palace.  So that's where I want us to focus our attention.  
JUDGE SHORT: 
Mr. Webster, before you go on. 

Mr. Witness, how soon after these meetings did Lieutenant Bizumuremyi tell you about the meetings?  
THE WITNESS: 
Well, Your Honour, both meetings -- the meetings took place at different times, but each time he came back from a meeting, it was that evening in the mess, on the same day, that he would report to me as to what was said at those meetings.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And, Witness, to the extent that you recall those specific conversations, do you know -- or, do you remember if any other participants in the meetings also participated in your conversation with Bizumuremyi?  In other words, were there other persons that also told you about these meetings?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, the conversation took place in the mess.  It was Lieutenant Bizumuremyi only who spoke to me of it, no one else.  
Q.	Thank you.  And getting back to the two meetings, did he say the same things with respect to both meetings, or was there any difference that you can recall?  
A.	At both meetings, Mr. Prosecutor, Lieutenant Bizumuremyi didn't speak to me -- tell me all the details, but spoke in general terms as to what had transpired.  But, if I remember correctly, it was consistently a question of support for the Rwandan armed forces.  So there would be a speech, or discussions, that he didn't speak to me about.  But what I do remember is the question of support for the army, and discipline among the militiamen -- before the 6th of April that is, as regarding meetings held before the 6th of April 1994. 
Q.	Well, I'd like to take -- refer to those two words that you used, "support" and "discipline".  Tell us what you meant -- what you mean when you say "support", what you understood those to mean in the context of those conversations?  How were the Interahamwe, or the militia, supposed to support the military? 
A.	In Gisenyi préfecture, in general terms, under normal circumstances, from what I could see, the militiamen were rather working for internal security against the Ibiyitso, who was called the Ibiyitso, the accomplices.  So they'd set up roadblocks throughout the city, in various places, and organised patrols; they'd check identity cards.  They'd even search people, they'd look in people's mouths to see if their gums were red or black; all sorts of things to see whether they could detect any traces of Tutsi.  

The Interahamwe, in general, in everything they did, I could summarise it as being support they were showing for the army, who couldn't be both at the front and fight the interior accomplices, who were the Tutsi, and some Hutu who were considered to be moderate.  So, they considered themselves to be somehow at the army's service, and they behaved as though they were military, and were supporting the soldiers by undertaking those ID checks and even arresting suspects.  That is what I mean by "support" for the army.  
Q.	And, just for the purposes of clarification, we're still talking about the period before 1994; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	You also talked about "discipline", that somehow Ngirumpatse raised the issue of discipline in these meetings.  Tell us what you understood when you heard reference to that during your conversations with Bizumuremyi?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, I'm going to object.  I think that we're -- it's not relevant what he understood, but what Bizumuremyi told him.  That's the foundation that needs to be laid.  And we've gotten far afield from what Bizumuremyi told him when he asked about support, and now I'm afraid we're going to get far afield again when he's asking about his impressions of some topic.  It should be what he was told, not what his understanding was.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, tell us what Bizumuremyi told you about discipline, and then tell us what you understood by that.  
A.	On the subject of discipline, Lieutenant Bizumuremyi told me that, from time to time, the militiamen would take individual decisions without consulting their immediate superiors who, inter alia, were one Bernard, or Omar Serushago, and there was another one named Thomas, Thomas.  And that is what we're referring to, the respect for their superiors.  Militiamen should not act without orders, instructions from their leaders, their chiefs -- without instructions.  Because at some times there was some disorder, and the militiamen would do whatever they wanted, and sometimes there'd even be settling of accounts, even between themselves.  That is what he told me about discipline.  
Q.	You mentioned one or two names that we had not heard previously in your testimony.  You mentioned a certain Bernard.  Can you tell us who this person was?  
A.	Bernard was the leader of the Interahamwe in Gisenyi. 
Q.	Did he have another name that you would use to refer to him as well?  
A.	The other name was Munyabagisha -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Witness says -- adds --
THE WITNESS:
-- Munyagishari. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
For the record, that's number 55.
THE WITNESS: 
His name was Munyagishari, Bernard.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Bernard Munyagishari.
MR. WEBSTER: 
For the record, that's number 55 on our spelling list.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	You also mentioned a Mr. Omar.  Tell us who that person was, please, if you knew him by another name, and what his status was, if he had any particular status.  
A.	Omar's full name was Omar Serushago.  He was the leader of a small group of militiamen.  
Q.	Could you tell if there was any particular relationship between Omar and Munyagishari?  How was the -- was there any relationship of hierarchy between the two?  
A.	Well, Mr. Prosecutor, Munyagishari was the head of all the militiamen, the leader, the chief, the boss of all the Interahamwe in Gisenyi.  But there was small groups that also had their chiefs, but Omar Serushago was directly answerable to Munyabagisha (sic). 
Q.	Mr. Witness, are you saying Munyabagisha or Munyagishari; could you clarify that for us, please? 
A.	Munyagishari.  Munyagishari.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Repeats the witness.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, concerning the times that you saw Ngirumpatse during 1994, can you tell us whether you saw him yourself, whether this was information that was given to you by other persons, and the circumstances under which you either observed Ngirumpatse, or received the information that he was in Gisenyi?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, before we move on to the next topic, I want to renew my objection to the hearsay information concerning the 1992 and 1993 meetings.  It's our position that, even with the foundation that's been laid, the information is unreliable because the declarant is deceased and not available.  And we also -- there's other information to show that this could not have occurred at that time.  But I understand, based on what you've heard alone, that I think that there's enough that you should conclude that it's not admissible.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I will simply rely on my last response -- my last submission on this point.  This is all issues of weight that the Court should decide at a later point in this trial or in this witness' testimony.  This is not an issue of admissibility.  If this Trial Chamber could only receive direct evidence there would be very little that would go forward in this case, or many cases that come before this Tribunal.  The Rules of Evidence and interpretation that has been given to them is very clear.  Hearsay evidence is admissible; simply because we do not have the declarant is no bar for the Court admitting the evidence, and then the Court will decide what weight to give to the evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We think that there is a sufficient foundation to this testimony.  The -- evidence has been given of a particular informant.  The problems mentioned as to the availability of the primary informant is an issue which will be considered when discussing reliability and weight, more particularly, weight of the testimony.  And we think that we should allow the evidence and consider it in due course with the other testimony on this issue.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I just wanted to clarify that I also have a pending objection concerning the lack of notice of this evidence that I understood you were going to decide at a later time.  So, is your ruling intended to encompass that objection also, or is that something that you're still keeping under consideration?  Because, again as I pointed out, you've already held that meetings, such as MRND meetings, are material facts that need to be in the indictment, and it's -- it's not in the indictment.  Paragraph 25, for example, that deals with meetings -- includes some meetings in Gisenyi at the stadium, but not this meeting.  So, I would like to have an objection ruled on at some point, if you -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, but we have not had a chance to look at the indictment.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  I just wanted to clarify your ruling didn't encompass a final decision on the admissibility of this testimony.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I was dealing with the -- your, your allegation that it was general gossip at the mess hall.  We thought the clarification by the witness was it was not just gossip, it was a statement by the informant.  The other aspects of that information will have to be considered when we decide how much reliance we can place on that testimony, but we thought we should admit it in relation to that particular objection that you raised.  
Now, you raised the other issue as to whether or not the evidence should be admitted, because there was no reference to it, either a specific charge, which is not referred to in the indictment.  We can't rule on that without checking the indictment.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
But do we both agree that goes to admissibility?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Which one?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Of issue of whether or not it's in the indictment goes to admissibility.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Of course, of course.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay, thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Webster, you can continue.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you were about to tell us about the times that you observed, or you were aware of Ngirumpatse's presence in Gisenyi in 1994.  Can you continue, please.  
A.	Well, Mr. Prosecutor, now we're talking of the period following the 6th of April 1994.  Is that correct, we're talking of after the 6th of April 1994, or before?  
Q.	What I'm trying to get a sense of is, globally, how many times -- excuse me.  

Mr. Witness, what I'm trying to address is how you come to know Mathieu Ngirumpatse, so we talked about the two occasions that he was present in Gisenyi in 1992 and 1993.  What I'm asking you now is to tell us about how you knew him, on the basis of either seeing him, or hearing about him, in 1994.  So, you can tell us about any time at all that you observed Mathieu Ngirumpatse, where this observation took place, and we will still come back at a later point in your testimony to go over the detail -- the events of April 1994 in more detail.  But just for right now we're trying to get a sense of how you know Mathieu Ngirumpatse and who he was.  
A.	Well, Mr. Prosecutor, after the 6th of April until mid-May 1994, Mr. Ngirumpatse came to the ops camp in Gisenyi to meet the ops commander.  And I saw him personally, because I was present in the camp.  
Q.	Did that happen on one occasion, or several?  Can you clarify that for us, please.  
A.	I think I saw him once. 
Q.	What was he doing at that time? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, he came to see the ops commander, and they spoke together in his office, and then when they had finished, he took him to the mess to have a drink.  And when they came out into the courtyard -- because that's where I was, in the internal courtyard -- when they were speaking in the courtyard, and when they wanted to leave, from their conversation I heard that they were speaking of the difficult situation in respect of the war that was ongoing on the front.  

But most of their conversation was in the office and in the officers' mess.  But, as they were leaving, as he was accompanying him, they spoke of the situation on the battlefront, that it was then difficult, and that they could no longer win the war.  And probably if they could organise themselves -- if we could organise ourselves, we could organise our people and retain the Gisenyi-Ruhengeri-Gitarama area, which was -- Gitarama, which, at that time, was in their hands.  
Q.	When you refer to the ops commander as being the person that Ngirumpatse was speaking to, tell us who that person was?  Who was the ops commander when this conversation was taking place? 
A.	Well, I don't know if he was still ops commander, but the one who was there was Lieutenant Colonel Nsengiyumva, who was the ops camp in Gisenyi.  But, from time to time we were told that he'd already begun to work with (French spoken) that had come from France, from Europe.  So I don't know if he had -- if he was officially ops commander, but he was still in the camp.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Commander of the camp, sorry.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, you testified about portion of a -- portions of a conversation that you overheard.  Over what period of time were you able to observe Ngirumpatse and Nsengiyumva talking?  How much of the conversation did you overhear?  
A.	When they exited, they spent about 20 minutes outside before he took his vehicle and left the camp.  
Q.	And concerning what they said in relation to the partition of the country, or retaining a portion of the country, did they make any other comment concerning the enemy in that portion of the country?  
A.	When they spoke of partition, or the possibility there was to organise a defence around Gisenyi, Ruhengeri, and Gitarama, they said that that part would be purified of Tutsi and other Ibiyitso, which means the enemies, accomplices, and that that zone would be a zone that would no longer -- where they would no longer have any infiltrations, because there would be no more accom -- enemy accomplices, who were the Tutsi and some Hutu moderates.  
Q.	Is your evidence that ridding that portion of the country of Ibiyitso is something that had already occurred at that point, or was it something that was ongoing?  Would you clarify that point for me, please.  
A.	Personally, because what was called at that time Ibiyitso were not only Tutsi, but also some Hutu who had links, connections with Tutsi, who had some friendships or other affinities, meant that the zone was not yet entirely cleaned up.  As they said ukureho umwanda -- to cleanse the trash.  Ukureho umwanda.  Perhaps there weren't any more Tutsi by then, or at least the most dangerous Tutsi -- the Tutsi were the most dangerous.  But there were many Hutu who did not entirely agree with that philosophy that was in force at the time, the purification of the zone Gisenyi, Ruhengeri, Gitarama, which is why they spoke of that, insisted on the topic of cleansing -- removing all suspects, whether Hutu or Tutsi.  
Q.	Well, on this issue of suspects, Mr. Witness, how did you come to understand, or to learn who would be included in the category of Ibiyitso, or Icyitso? 
A.	Well, I had to know it, because as the -- ***********************************************, I should warn against certain people and say why.  And, first of all, were they Ibiyitso, and point -- at point -- that I should point out them, and in fact I was running the risk of being eliminated.  So, when they told me that the war we were waging -- in spite of the fact the enemy came from Uganda, we are fighting against the Tutsi.  And inside the country there are people who are friends with Tutsi, there are even Tutsi, and people who have married Tutsi women, whose father-in-law and brother-in-law, they have many affinities.  All those people we must beware of -- we must be wary of.  That's the first thing.  

And secondly, in the mess with the military officers, they'd speak of the front from which they'd come.  They spoke of the war in general, and they'd say, "We are at war with the Tutsi."  And in -- at the outset, in the beginning, they said, "We are at war with the Tutsi."  But at one point, with multiparty politics, they began to say, "There are even many of our Hutu brothers who are no longer with us, and who are betraying us."  So -- that also explained to me what, in society in general, and the military circles where I moved, what were the enemy and the enemy's accomplices.  
Q.	(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Sorry, do you want counsel to repeat his question?  I am sorry, we hadn't turned off the microphone here.  
JUDGE SHORT: 
Mr. Webster, could you repeat the question?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, hold on one second.  Mr. Witness, I was asking you for a point of clarification, because in your answer, and your previous response, when you were talking about the Hutu, you said there were some members of the Hutu that were considered enemies, and others who were not.  And I'm asking you to clarify for us if the same can be said for the Tutsi.  Were there some Tutsi who were not the enemy, or was it all Tutsi?  Clarify what you understood, what people -- what your superiors told you so that we can understand exactly what you mean.  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, as regards the country as a whole, I can't tell you what the -- how the Tutsi were considered in general, but in Gisenyi, where I lived, whether in civilian society when I was exercising my functions as a (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal), or when I worked with the military and was in military circles, I never heard any reference to "moderate Tutsi".  They spoke of Inyenzi and of the enemy.  Even the word "RPF" was rarely used.  They'd just say Tutsi or Inyenzi, meaning that all Tutsi were considered to be the enemy.  I never heard ever mentioned or discussed reference to people mentioning between themselves anything about moderate Tutsi.  
Q.	You also made a reference to a Kinyarwanda expression.  I believe you said ukureho umwanda.  Could you explain that to us again, please?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
For the record, it's number 83 on our spelling list.  
THE WITNESS: 
Ukureho umwanda, Mr. Prosecutor, would in French be "remove the trash".  And that was the term used to get -- to mean to get rid of the Tutsi.  And, at that time, Tutsi were considered to be dirt, filth, trash.  Filth that should be gotten rid of. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Who would use these expressions? 
A.	I don't know who invented the expression, but what I can know is that in the circles in which I moved in the officers' mess and in Gisenyi town, even when I'd sometimes go to my drinking place, the Interahamwe who were there used that expression to mean to get rid of the Tutsi. 
Q.	Did you ever hear this expression used by persons in authority, either in military circles, or in civilian circles?  I'm not talking about low-level Interahamwe, I'm talking about persons at the highest levels of civilian and military authority in Gisenyi at that time.  
A.	That term was particularly used by the lesser folk. 
(Pages 20 to 36 by Kirstin McLean)















1230H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Did you ever hear anyone in authority use that term or any similar language? 
A.	I no longer recall, Mr. Prosecutor, if ever I had such an experience.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I see that it's 12:30.  We can stop at this point and pick up again after the luncheon recess, if this is a convenient time to stop.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we can take the luncheon adjournment now.  We resume at 2 o'clock.  

Mr. Witness, I remind you, as I did yesterday afternoon, that during this or any adjournment you remain a witness in our trial, and you're not to discuss your testimony or the case with anybody.  

We take the adjournment now.  
(Court recessed from 1230H to 1410H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.  We are ready to resume.  

Before you ask, Mr. Robinson, we are not quite ready yet.  Hopefully by tomorrow morning.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  And, Mr. President, I just wanted to inform you that I delivered to the CMS, through Issa, a few minutes ago copies of the exhibits that I'm going to use during the cross-examination of this witness.  I don't expect that cross-examination to begin until tomorrow afternoon or the day after, but I wanted to give time to everybody to -- for him to make the copies.  But I want to make it clear they're not to be distributed to anyone until the Prosecution has completed its direct examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
In regard to that, thank you very much for making the reciprocal disclosure so early.  What I would request is that the registry scan those materials and provide it to us in an electronic form as well.  

I'd also -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  Is that too fast? 

MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, no, no.  I took particular note of the phrase "reciprocal disclosure." 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  No, that's -- that's how the -- how the -- the rules identify it.  I think it's Rule 60 -- 67, if I'm not -- if I'm not mistaken.  Because there is that obligation by the rules, but we appreciate it.  

With regard to the motion that Mr. Robinson made earlier, I'd like to make some comments in regard to that, if it's -- if the Court gives me leave to do so. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we have not -- we have not really reached a decision yet, so we can hear -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
No. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- so we can hear you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  Great.  Because I went back and looked at the indictment.  I also looked at the pre-trial brief and the disclosures in this case.  And in the indictment I'd refer the Court and the parties to paragraph 23, paragraph -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, no -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, if -- Mr. President, if the Prosecutor would slow down, that would assist the interpreters.  Thank you very much. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, when Mr. Fie (phonetic) is there, he always asks me to speak in French because then I'd be sure to speak more slowly.  Maybe one day I'm going to try that.  

I'd refer the Court and the parties to paragraph 23 of the indictment and paragraph 24, and then there are a whole string of subparagraphs under paragraph 24.  Since everyone has these materials, I'm not going to take the time to read the paragraphs into the record, but it's my submission that these cover the issue of meetings organised by Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Joseph Nzirorera in furtherance of the conspiracy.  

I'd also direct the Court to the pre-trial brief, specifically paragraphs 37 and 41.  In both of those paragraphs in the pre-trial brief, which I will read, there's a reference to this particular witness and the testimony that we expect from him.  In paragraph -- 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, it is not necessary that you read it -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
All right. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping) -- it's already part of the record. 
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.  Also in the pre-trial brief, there is a summary of the anticipated testimony of ZF.  There's a whole collection of summaries of the anticipated testimonies of all Prosecution witnesses.  And specifically, in the middle of the summary that we have provided for ZF, which is part of our pre-trial brief, it states, "The witness will also testify about other meetings involving Ngirumpatse that occurred --" excuse me.  

"The witness will testify that Ngirumpatse met with Commander Nsengiyumva, the préfet, some sous-préfets, and the chef de service, bourgmestres, and chief militiamen in Gisenyi on several occasions prior to the 6th of April 1994 and that the object of their meetings was," quote, unquote, "'the mobilisation and discipline within the MRND and the protection of the préfecture against the enemy and its accomplices.'"  

So I think my submission is that, between the indictment and the pre-trial brief, there is certainly sufficient notice of this portion of the witness's testimony.  

Then if we go on to his witness statement, I would direct the Court to the witness statement of December 10th, 2004.  On page 8 of the English text, there are three full paragraphs that go over the same general issue, and I don't think it's necessary for me to read them into the record.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.  We were unable to find the English text of the statement. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I can provide the Court with another copy. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does it exist electronically?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, it does.  And I thought it was a part of the electronic text that I provided to the parties -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping) no.  Maybe -- maybe it's our fault, but we just couldn't access it. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I can send it to you again, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
In which case I will then -- I can read it if -- okay.  On page 8 it starts, "With -- with respect to Ngirumpatse, he sometimes visited Gisenyi as well before April 6th, 1994, to meet with 
A. Nsengiyumva, the préfet, the sous-préfet, heads of units, bourgmestres, militia leaders, and Bizumuremyi on the preface -- on the premises of the préfecture.  Thanks to the latter," referring to Bizumuremyi, "who briefed me and to (sic) comments heard at the officers' mess at Gisenyi camp, I got to know the purposes of the meetings was to discuss --" 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, if the Prosecutor could please slow down for the interpreters.  We don't have copies of that document in the booth.  
MR. WEBSTER:
"Thanks to the latter, who briefed me, and the comments heard at the officers' mess at Gisenyi camp, I got to know that the purpose of the meetings was to discuss," quote, unquote, "'training and discipline within the MRND and the protection of the préfecture against the enemy and its accomplices.'  

"After the 6th of April, Ngirumpatse sometimes held meetings with A. Nsengiyumva and Bizumuremyi at Gisenyi camp --" 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I don't think you need to read any more into the -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- record.  I think you've identified sufficiently the portion we have to look at. 
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.  Now, coming to the law on the issue, I would still refer the Court to the judgement in Niyitegeka at paragraph 44.  And since that's a matter of public record, I'm not going to take the time to read that entire paragraph.  But I think if the Court reads that -- refers to that paragraph, and to the Rutaganda judgement at paragraph 303, and the Kupreskic judgement at paragraphs 115 to 125 -- and here I'm referring to the judgements of the Appeals Chamber -- I think those legal authorities, coupled with the notice that is clearly given in the indictment, in the pre-trial brief, and in disclosures in this case, should convince this Trial Chamber that the Defence was clearly on notice of this evidence and was in a position to anticipate it through this witness in this trial.  

So I'll conclude with that in terms of the motion issue.  

There is one other issue that I wanted to raise with the Court.  It has to do with bits and pieces of this witness's testimony in open session earlier this morning.  I'm a bit concerned that, in his responses, sometimes he makes reference to his place of employment and to his -- his status at various points during the period 1990 to 1994. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, we have the power to order it excerpted. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Right.  That's what I was going to request. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you would have to assist in identification. 
MR. WEBSTER:
That will not be a problem. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. 
MR. WEBSTER:
What I was going to request the Court to do is allow us to take his testimony, and every -- any reference to his -- the ministry that he worked for previously could be removed and we could put that on another piece of paper and attach it to Exhibit 21, which is his identifying information, so that we would continue with this testimony.  Anytime there's a slip, we will simply go back to it and excise it from -- from the record.  But we'd have some way of keeping track independently. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated) 

Okay.  The registrar has advised me that it would be sufficient to make an order for redaction of references to his place of employment on the record. 

Now, Mr. Witness -- I'd like to attract your attention, please.  

This morning I indicated to you -- 
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I indicated to you when we had moved into open session -- and -- and maybe I should have told you a little bit more about the effect of being in open session.  The testimony that you give here becomes public knowledge, and the purpose of our protective order was to assist in the concealment of your identity from the public.  So you have to assist in the way you phrase your answers, not to provide information that would reveal your identity.  We will do our best to try to monitor that, but you also have to be alert as well.  

Yes, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  Can I have just a few minutes for a brief reply to -- on this issue of the indictment? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I'm sorry.  I had -- I did intend to invite you.  Are you ready to reply now or do you -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
(Microphones overlapping) yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Because we could have heard you anytime before we adjourn this afternoon (microphones overlapping). 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But if you are ready, we could take -- we could hear.
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  I'm ready, and it will be quick. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  
MR. ROBINSON:
So this issue of whether a specific meeting is contained within general language of the indictment seems to be one that we keep coming up against in every session.  I remind you that in the first session with Mr. Mbonyinkiza (phonetic) we had a -- an event, a meeting in Kibungo at a place called Chazumakaza (phonetic).  And during -- the -- your ultimate ruling in that case was that the substance of what was said by Mr. Ngirumpatse at that meeting, which I believe took place in 1992 -- or, at least the witness claimed it did -- could not be led in evidence because it was not in the indictment or -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, perhaps you could repeat the names and places to which you just referred. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Kibungo is the préfecture, K-I-B-U-N-G-O.  And Chazumakaza, or something like that, and I'll ask my client to give the spelling to the court reporters at a later time because I don't know exactly how it's pronounced or spelled.

In any event, so we confronted that in the first session, and -- and you made a ruling.  We confronted it again last session with Witness UB, and we're confronting it again.  So our position is that, simply because -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Slow down. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Simply because the indictment charges that over the course of several years there were meetings, which is what is in paragraph 23, or that over the course of 1993 and 1994 there were initiatives taken to do certain things, which is what's in paragraph 24, or that there were meetings held, in paragraph 25, some of which are actually specified, it is not enough to put us on notice of particular MRND meetings.  And if it were, it seems like none of the evidence so far that we've heard has been excluded -- would have been excluded.  

The Prosecutor had the opportunity, as he's done in paragraph 25, to list specific meetings by date, place, and participants, and at which it -- which -- at which it intended to lead evidence as to what had occurred at those meetings.  And so when it has done so, it's entitled to -- it's given us adequate notice through the indictment.  And when it hasn't done so, it's our position that it's not adequate notice to simply sit here and expect that anytime somebody comes up with a meeting between 1990 and 1994 we have to defend against it.  

So, step one, the issue of is the indictment defective, we think that the Trial Chamber ought to make a very definitive ruling at this time so we don't keep revisiting this as to whether or not the general language in the indictment is sufficient or whether specific meetings are needed to be pled in order for the indictment to be adequate as to those -- as to evidence of meetings with the MRND.  

So that's the first step of your enquiry, is the indictment defective.  And it's our position that the indictment is defective when it doesn't mention a specific meeting.  

Then the next thing that you have to go to see is whether we've had clear notice -- clear and consistent notice from other documents in the case to allow the correction of a defective indictment, such that the evidence can still be admitted.  And we recognise that the pre-trial brief can provide such notice if the information in the pre-trial brief is clear and consistent.  And if you look at the paragraphs in the pre-trial brief that Mr. Webster cited, there is -- just as general as the indictment itself about "Witness ZF will testify to a series of meetings," et cetera.  So it's our position that we haven't received clear and consistent notice.  

The last -- okay.  Everybody's telling me to slow down.  I have to get used to this pace.  I've been in California for the last few months. 

The last point -- the last line of defence for the Prosecution is whether or not a witness statement can provide, in and of itself, such as the one in 1990 -- in 2004, can -- can, itself, constitute adequate notice.  And on this point, first I call to your attention -- I think you do have the electronic version of this, but it's dated April of 2004, and that may be why you haven't been able to locate it, because I just looked on my own electronic statements, and there's one dated 8 April 2004 and -- which is the interview continued into December.  And so I think that's the statement that everybody's referring to.  

In any event, the Appeals Chamber has held in the Ntakirutimana case, in its judgement at paragraph 27; in the Niyitegeka case, in its judgement at paragraphs 197 and 221; and the Trial Chambers have held in the Mpambara case, in a decision of 20 -- of 30 May 2005; in Muhimana case, in its trial judgement at paragraph 452; and a decision in the Bagosora case of 27 September 2005 at 
paragraph 5; and in another decision in the Bagosora case of 27 September 2005 at paragraph 3, that the mere service of witness statements by the Prosecution does not suffice to inform the Defence of material facts that the Prosecution intends to use at trial.  

So it's our position that when you analyse this particular meet -- testimony of this particular 
meeting (sic) the MRND in 1992 and 1993 in Gisenyi, that it's not in the pre-trial -- it's not in the indictment and the pre-trial brief, and it's not adequately described in any -- in the -- in the attachment to the pre-trial brief, the witness summary, such as to have been clear and consistent to put us on notice; and that, even if it is described in the witness statement, that's not sufficient to overcome a defect in the indictment.  

So for all of those reasons, we ask that you exclude the evidence.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are there any other -- does anybody else wish to make any submissions?  

Okay.  Well, once again, we reserve our position.  

Mr. Webster, you may continue now.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  Mr. Witness, earlier in your testimony this morning -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry.  You're directing me to continue with the witness.  Is that -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Earlier in your testimony this morning, you mentioned that the MRND party was somehow linked to the radio network at the préfecture.  And I'd like to come back to that issue briefly. 

Do you know, or did you -- do you have any information concerning radio reports that were made to the MRND party during the course of events from 1990 to 1994?  Based on your direct observation, can you tell us if the types of information that you came into contact with through the work that you did was made available to the MRND party? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, that was rather long question.  Could you please kindly repeat. 
Q.	Yes, I'm sorry.  Do you know if the MRND party received information that passed through your hands? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Can you give us an example of that? 
A.	The example that comes to mind is that, after November 1990, when I was already at point A, there came a time when distribution of messages was also made.
Q.	Was there an incident involving Byahi commune that would suggest to you that these -- that the forwarding of messages to the MRND continued after 1992? 
A.	As far as Byahi secteur is concerned, at some time in 1992, the conseiller of that secteur provided information to the effect that there had been infiltrations into the secteur.  Following that information there was some unrest in Byahi secteur between the inhabitants and the Tutsis of that secteur.  The conseiller notified the gendarmerie -- or, should I say, the ops commander to the effect that the enemy was mounting resistance in that secteur, namely, resistance from the Tutsi, who had come from the Democratic Republic of Congo, particularly from Goma.  

The ops commander, who at the time was Bahufite, Juvénal, issued orders to Commander Bizimana to dispatch gendarmes to the area.  And the gendarmes landed, saying they had come to restore order.  And we subsequently learnt that people had died; some Tutsis had been killed, and survivors had fled to Goma.  

Other messages were also received from the CNEE, Centre nat'l d'écoute énnemie, and these were received by the ops commander, Bahufite.  And a copy was forwarded to the MRND as well in Rubavo commune, Byahi secteur.  At some point it was being said that there were threats of infiltrations from Goma.  Those were rumours that led to suspicions that one family, the family of Kajeguhuaka, Valens, and the conseiller of the Byahi secteur had to use the Interahamwe militia to attack that family of the Kajeguhuaka, Valens's, relatives.  Those people were killed, and their bodies were dumped in toilets.  

Those are the Byahi events that I can still recall.  The information was provided by the conseiller of Byahi secteur himself. 
Q.	All right.  For the record, Byahi secteur is number 24 on our spelling list, and Kajeguhuaka is number 38 on our spelling list.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, excuse me.  I would like to move to strike all this testimony regarding massacres or killings in Byahi secteur.  It has no link to any of the events that are pled in the indictment.  Killings in 1992 in a secteur in Gisenyi has no -- first of all, it's not charged in the indictment; but, secondly, it just has no relevance to what -- the charges that Mr. Nzirorera is -- is charged with in the indictment or within the temporal jurisdiction of the Tribunal.  

I realise that events from before 1994 can be admitted if it has some purpose, but when we're starting to admit evidence of killings that are so remote from the time, the place, and any other connection with Mr. Nzirorera, we think that it's irrelevant and prejudicial and should be excluded.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, the -- the evidence is being solicited not to hold Mr. Nzirorera or anybody on the -- the -- either of the other two co-Accused responsible for the killings.  What I'm trying to elicit, and it should come with a -- a few additional questions, is the links between the military and the MRND party after 1992.  

So, essentially, this line of questioning is meant to elicit how those two were working in tandem.  I'm really not as concerned about the killings themselves.  So that's the -- the purpose -- and I think, having stated that, this Trial Chamber should be convinced that it is relevant because, all through this indictment, we've alleged that military authorities worked hand in hand with the MRND party and with the government administration.  And that's what's being elicited here. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if I could just briefly reply.  When you -- in balancing probative value of evidence versus its prejudicial effect, we've had evidence that Lieutenant Bizumuremyi was coordinating the activities between the military and the Interahamwe.  We think that that point has been made very clearly by this witness.  To admit killings which they claim are made by the Interahamwe in -- in furtherance of this very same purpose, that's the perfect example of -- of evidence which is more -- more prejudicial than probative and should be excluded.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, if -- if we were arguing this case before a jury, perhaps Mr. Robinson -- Mr. Robinson's point would be more convincing.  But here we find ourselves between -- among -- before a Court of three professional Judges.  I think we should all have enough confidence in the Trial Chamber to -- to assume that whatever may be prejudicial about this evidence will be shifted to the side when the Court makes its assessment of the evidence.  So I'm -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, Mr. Webster.  What I am thinking is that we should allow you to continue.  And the issue of admissibility is a matter which we can rule on at any stage.  I don't think that we are sufficiently confident to make a ruling now, but we will allow you to continue, and we will review this matter.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  With all due respect, I would like to object to that manner of proceeding.  I understand when -- when there's a question of what's in an indictment and what's not, that you need to consult an indictment and things like that.  But I don't think that we should adopt a manner of proceeding in this trial that evidence comes in subject to being later struck.  

This is an issue of -- of weighing probative value and prejudicial effect.  You can do it amongst yourself in a few minutes.  But to continue to -- and if you want to suspend this area of enquiry, okay.  But to continue to receive more information, I think, is -- is not a correct way of dealing with spontaneous, contemporaneous objections. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  Mr. Robinson, the issue is (unintelligible), as far as I understand the rules of admissibility of evidence in this Tribunal, that the -- the exclusionary rules that -- that are applicable in many common law jurisdictions are not -- are not applicable to the same degree because you are dealing with professional Judges.  

Now, the particular point that you have raised with this issue has -- is not a strictly legal point.  It is a point which requires a certain degree of evaluation, and you want (unintelligible) me the probative value as opposed. 

Now, there's a level at which, if we were a jury, your point would have much more weight than it does at the moment.  And Mr. Webster has indicated that in two or three questions he will connect it to the point he was just to make.  I don't think that it was right for us to tell him he should not ask those two or three questions.  That's the point.  Now, after he has asked those two or three questions, we still have the opportunity to rule on the issue of admissibility. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, returning to the example of Byahi secteur, the events that you just described, can you tell us if there was any relay of information from the services that you worked with to the MRND party that also involved the military establishment in Gisenyi?
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I personally believe that yes, such was the case.  All the activities within Gisenyi préfecture relating to what were referred to as security and protection of Gisenyi town, or in the search for Ibiyitso and accomplices, as well as infiltrators of the RPF believed to have infiltrated the Rubavo town, all these activities were carried out concomitantly between the MRND, the CDR, and the Rwandan army.  

I say so because the MRND youth wing -- the MRND youth wing, the Interahamwe; and the CDR youth wing, the Impuzamugambi -- were doing more or less the same thing as the gendarmerie, that is, they patrolled the borders with the Democratic Republic of Congo.  And Goma town is quite close to Gisenyi, so they did mount roadblocks.  And when they had finished all what they were doing, they would report to their bosses; the Interahamwe would report to Omar Serushago or to Bernard Munyagishari.  And the CDR militia would report either to Mabuye, who was their boss, or to one Michel, who was also one of their bosses, or Bernard or even Barnabé Samvura, who was the head of the Impuzamugambi militia.  

And it is those bosses who would come to see Bizumuremyi at the camp and to report to him accordingly.  He would then, in turn, forward that report to the commander -- to the ops commander of the area.  

So as far as I am concerned, and I believe the same would apply to all those who were there and who saw what I saw as well, I can presume that there was close and frank collaboration between the CDR and the MRND parties and the army, as well as the military command offices in Gisenyi. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, a lot of names and places were referred to in this aspect of the testimony.  Could you give some assistance -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- of the spelling? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I was about to do that, Your Honour.  

With respect to Samvura, Barnabé, we see that at item 77 of our spelling list; Bernard Munyagishari is at 55 of the spelling list; Mabuye is at 46 of our spelling list; Byahi is at 24 in our spelling list; Impuzamugambi is at 33.

And I think I've covered everything. 

BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know if the MRND had any system in place to monitor the local population in Gisenyi during the period after 1992? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, when you talk about monitoring, once again, I do not quite understand what that concept means.  Are you referring to spying on them or monitoring them, following them up?  Or, what do you mean?  I haven't quite understood the meaning of "monitor --" 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
At least we got it in French as (French spoken).
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Well, to the extent that the military had their intelligence networks that were run by the S2 officer, my question to you is, did the MRND party, as far as you know, have any mechanism in place in Gisenyi to keep track of what the local population was doing?  Were there any systems of spying on the local population or of sending reports on the population through MRND party channels to its leadership? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  In my earlier testimony, I referred to the Interahamwe, the MRND party militia, and I said that the Interahamwe militia were doing more or less the same thing that the gendarmerie was doing; namely, they would patrol the city of Bukavu.  They even checked people's identity, particularly those whom they suspected, and somehow they were spying to determine whether any people had infiltrated the city from Goma or from elsewhere and to also find out whether there would be any Tutsis hiding among the Hutus.  

So those people, who may have been arrested after the identification checks and what have you, were taken to the -- their bosses, and reports were also made accordingly.  And these bosses would then forward the information to their hierarchy and then on to Kigali.  So this information was not only available to the ops commander, but from there on to the very highest level of the hierarchy.  

The information that was received at the military command in Gisenyi, I believe, did not end at that military command in Gisenyi because the ops commander was under the obligation to report to the general staff and to the ministry of defence.  

So when the militia provided information to their immediate bosses, they would, in turn, pass on that information to the -- their hire -- hierarchy, namely, the presidency of the MRND in Kigali.  
Q.	And how did you come to know this, Mr. Witness?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry?  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, how did you come to know this, that this information was passed from the Interahamwe to their bosses to the O-P-S, to the MRND party, to Kigali?  What's the basis of you making that statement?  Is this something that somebody told you?  Do you have personal experience in passing messages along?  Did you see the impact afterwards of the messages that were passed along that chain?  Give the Court some understanding of why you are able to say these things.  What is the basis of your knowledge? 
A.	I can refer to several sources, including the coordinators or the coordinator of those militia, namely, Lieutenant Bizumuremyi, who explained everything to me in the course of our conversations in respect to the transmission of messages.  You see, *******************************, I knew how these were transmitted to hierarchy.  Now, I asked him, and I was interested in finding out from him, how the reports were processed and where they ended up.  So this came up in our conversations and discussions, in the course of which he told me that all intelligence, whether it be gathered through civilian or military sources, is put together and sent to the highest level of the hierarchy involved.

Well, as far as the impact was concerned, there were things which I saw with my own eyes.  There were people whom, as I have earlier said, were being spied upon by the Interahamwe.  The Interahamwe checked on the identification -- or, the identity of suspects.  People had been arrested in Gisenyi, and some people would come from Kigali, either from the general staff or from the presidency of the republic, and these people would arrest persons on the basis of information that had originated in Gisenyi.  For example, someone might have been identified or pointed out as being a friend of the enemy, and, therefore, a suspect.  

When such information went to the superiors, a decision would be taken to arrest such an individual, and the order would come from the presidency.  And since these reports originated from the MRND militia, then the orders would come from the presidency, which was collaborating with the MRND militia.  So people would be arrested and locked up.  

I can mention the case of *********************************************************************************
**********************************************************************************.  He was arrested following suspicions that he was an accomplice.  He was immediately taken to the general staff in Kigali.  Fortunately, after some time and upon cross-checking, he was released.  

All this, therefore, points to the fact that the messages that were sent through the ops commander went all the way to the general staff because the suspected person I have just mentioned was taken to Kigali, was taken all the way to Kigali.  

I can mention the case of an accountant at the Meridien hotel, whose name escapes me.  I do not recall his name, but he was arrested on the grounds that he was an accomplice of the enemy, and the initial report had come from the Interahamwe, which had searched his home and had suspected him of being an accomplice of the enemy.  So the message went from the Interahamwe through the MRND, and the decision came from Kigali to arrest him and to imprison him.  

These two examples, I believe, are the examples that I can provide to explain the manner in which the activities or the -- the reports or -- or, the impact of the reports of the militia, the impacts those reports had at the highest level in Kigali, that is, at the level of the general staff, the MRND, and the presidency of the republic in Kigali.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
For the record, there was a reference to a Philibert Ngarukiye, and it's number 59 on our spelling list. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm going to move on to another line of questioning now.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. Webster.  Before you do, I would like to return to the Byahi secteur and the link between the killings that have been provisionally heard in evidence and any relevance to this trial.  

And I would ask that now you weigh the probative value against the prejudicial effect, and I think there's been no link made.  Or, if there is a link, it's so tenuous as to be more prejudicial than probative.  

And I would also like to just add, as a legal argument, that we know you're professional Judges.  But if we took that as the end of the story, there would be no balancing of probative value versus prejudicial effect.  Everything would come in, and you would be expected to sort it out all at the end.  But that's not how the rules work.  There's some initial balancing that has to be done when evidence is admitted.  

And, also, there's a prejudicial effect when evidence is admitted in public session that either we don't answer or we feel that we have to answer.  

So I would ask that you exclude the evidence.  It will simplify, to some small degree, at least, the rest of the trial, and I think that it's something that's incumbent upon you to do as a gatekeeper of reliable and probative evidence that should be admitted into the trial.  

Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, ultimately this is a question of the Court's discretion.  I don't think there's anything I could say on this legally that hasn't already been said, either today or at other points during the trial.  

What I would express, though, is that with respect to the testimony on Byahi, there was a lot of testimony there that I could go into in detail.  Many terms were tossed around that I didn't explore.  The witness mentioned infiltration.  I didn't explore that with him.  The witness mentioned unrest, a number of ambiguities that are worthy of exploration.  And I, in -- in -- in -- in the interest of moving along, I haven't gone into any of that stuff.  

Now, if the problem is the foundation and the link between this witness's testimony about that incident and the charges in this indictment, I can go back into it and spend another 20 minutes flushing out things that may provide a broader basis to -- to show the connections.  But I don't think it's necessary.  But if the Court would request that I do so, I will, and the links will be there.  

I would suggest to the Court that they're already on the record.  I've already stated that the killings themselves are really not the object of that line of enquiry.  It was how the civilian authorities and the military authorities and authorities within the MRND party collaborated with each other on the basis of information that came initially from the militia. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Webster, on the issue of collaboration between the military and the MRND, has that been adequately pleaded?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I can look through the indictment and provide the Court with specific references.  But all through the indictment and through the pre-trial brief, there's an allegation of joint criminal enterprise, that all of these sources of authority within the country, through the political parties, through the government administration, and through the military, that they were all acting in concert towards the end of committing genocide of the Tutsi.  So, yes, I would -- I would say so.  

If the Court would give me a brief moment, I can provide specific references in the indictment and the pre-trial brief.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, maybe while Mr. Webster's looking at that, I could -- I would have to say, candidly, that, in my opinion, that actually has been adequately pleaded in the indictment because of the existence of the military leaders as members of the joint criminal enterprise. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Okay.  Thank you very much.  

Mr. Webster, you don't need to go through the indictment, then.  
MR. WEBSTER:
(Microphones overlapping)

MR. PRESIDENT:
We are waiting for you to tell Mr. Robinson "thank you."  
MR. WEBSTER:
(Microphone not activated) I forgot my manners, but thank you, Mr. Robinson, for that concession.  

And then I can also direct the Court to paragraph 6 of the indictment, and it -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's not necessary. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
See, Mr. Robinson, we will endeavour to give you the short form of our view at the moment, since you want it now.  

The main plank of your submission, we don't think, can stand.  The -- we don't think that the -- as far as we are concerned, in the context of this case, that the evidence of the killings has a highly prejudicial effect.  We think that's minimal.  So we don't think that the -- the -- using the principle of weighing the probative value against the prejudicial effect of that particular testimony is persuasive.  

We don't think that the impact on the public is -- is -- is critical, either, in the context of this matter.  There is no allegation that any of the Accused persons were involved in these activities, so -- and we see it as a purely background circumstance, linking certain types of evidence, which we have not yet even embarked upon in the exercise of weighing the reliability or weight of this testimony.  But we don't think it's proper to exclude it at this stage. 
MR. ROBINSON:
If I could bring one more consideration to your attention, and that is management of the time of this trial.  When it -- when an incident like this comes into evidence, it shifts to us some obligation to respond to it.  And that could mean witnesses being called or other witnesses being questioned about this incident.  It seems to me that if your goal is to save time, given the minimal -- this -- this particular incident advanced the Prosecution's point so minimally, that do you really think it's a -- isn't it a better idea to nip it at the bud than to exclude it, rather than putting it in play and having it become an issue that has to be addressed by the Defence in its case or in cross-examination of other -- wouldn't it be a better idea, and given the limited probative value of this, to exclude it and move forward into a more concise battle of the actual things that are at issue in the case?  

That's -- I make that -- that one point that maybe you haven't considered, but I think it's important to the management of the trial. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  We have been thinking about that issue quite a lot.  We have not yet come to the point where we feel it's the -- there's enough evidence on record for us to start exercising that type of reasoning in curtailing the admissibility of evidence.  But it is an issue of which we have been thinking, and we appreciate the fact that you have said it so the Prosecutor will think about it as well.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And I'll -- I'll be referring to this discussion and this result when we come to talk about the crash of President Habyarimana's plane on the 6th of April of 1994.  

Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I can assure the Court that the Prosecution is thinking about the breadth of this case and the -- the breadth of the evidence that we're leading, but we also recognise that we have a burden of proof and that we have to meet our burden of proof.  So that's really our concern.

And if the evidence advances the Prosecution case so minimally, then I would think that the -- the appropriate response would be to reply to it minimally or not reply to it at all because, if it's so inconsequential, then there's nothing to defend against.  But I'll continue. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'd like us to begin talking about meetings that were held at location A.  Did you become aware of any meetings of officers and -- military and civilian authorities that were held at location A during the period 1990 to 1994? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  During that period of -- going from 1990 to 1993, towards the end of '93, there were meetings.  I don't know if we can refer to them as meetings between military and civilian authorities and government authorities of the time.  
Q.	Well, how would you describe them, Mr. Witness? 
A.	There was a first meeting which took place before I moved, and that means before November 1990.  So I was personally not present, but a report was made to me by Major Kabera at the officers' mess later on, much later on, when I was settled at (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal).  

A second meeting which took place at point A, on that occasion I was already present.  I had set up my equipment, and I was already working there.  That was during the second half of 1992.  I have no clear recollection of the date.  

And the third meeting which took place at point A took place towards the beginning of 1993, roughly around February 1993.  
And then the fourth one took place during the middle of the second half of 1993, approximately around August. 

And the fifth one, which took place at point A, took place towards the end of 1993 -- towards the end of 1993.  

So the second, which took place during the second half of 1992, I was present during that one.  But I got the information on the others, and I also saw the to'ing and fro'ing of people at town, at the (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) commando training camp.  But I did not see the actual meeting.  
Q.	All right.  We're going to take them one by one, and we may take them a bit out of order, but I believe you've -- you've listed for us five separate meetings that you were aware of.  Can we agree on that? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Initially, in my -- my opening question on this issue, I described them as meetings of civilian and military and party authorities.  You seemed to take objection to that.  How would you describe these -- these gatherings?  I'd like you to describe them and tell us how you perceive them.  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, are you referring to all the meetings or just the first one? 
Q.	Well, I'm actually going back to your initial response to my question, because I was -- I just wanted to clarify something for the record.  My understanding of what you said is that you didn't characterise them as meetings, per se, and I'm asking you to describe them to us.  If -- if "meeting" is not an accurate term, use the word or the description that you think is most accurate to give us a sense of what was happening on those five occasions at (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) -- excuse me, at location A.  
JUDGE SHORT:
So did he say that they were not meetings, or he said they were not meetings between officers, the military, and civilian authorities?  
MR. WEBSTER:
It wasn't clear to me, Your Honour.  That's why I'm trying to -- to get back to that point.  Maybe I can rephrase the -- 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you describe the five incidents that you began to mention in relation to location A? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  Before he does that, maybe this would be the time for me to make my objection that -- to exclude evidence of these meetings as a result of their not being described in the indictment.  And I would say that none of these meetings are referred to in the indictment.  They are referred to in the pre-trial brief at two locations:  Paragraph 41, where it says that "Omar Serushago and ZF will chronicle secret meetings held at various locations in Gisenyi beginning in 1992"; and in paragraph 141, where it says that "Witness ZF will testify that sometime in 1992 several meetings were held in Gisenyi in certain military camps and at the Meridien hotel."  And both go on to say who the participants were.  

It's our position that this is not -- these are material facts that are not in the indictment, and, therefore, the indictment is defective.  And it's not cured by this general information in the pre-trial brief.  

I will say that the witness statements detail these meetings in considerable detail, and they have information about that from the witness statements.  But, again, it's our position that witness statements are not sufficient to put the parties on notice as to what will be led during the indictment -- during the charges -- the trial on the indictment.  

And I would particularly point out that the first meeting in 1990 is far outside the scope of any reference to meetings in the indictment.  In every paragraph of the indictment, when they were mentioning meetings, they talk about meetings after 1992.  And even the two paragraphs in the pre-trial brief talk about meetings beginning in 1992.  So the meeting in November of 1990 is far outside the scope of any notice from the indictment, the pre-trial brief, or any other documents.  

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any comment, Mr. Robinson -- Mr. Webster? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I think we're returning to the same issue, legally, Your Honour.  Mr. Robinson has already acknowledged that the meetings are mentioned in the pre-trial brief, paragraphs 37 and 41.  In the summary of the witness's anticipated evidence, which is also part of the pre-trial brief, there's adequate notice in the witness statements and in the will-say statement.  We go into quite a bit of detail.  Clearly, the Defence was on notice of these allegations.  None of these allegations are taking the Defence by surprise.  I think Mr. Robinson's objection is overly legalistic.  The Defence clearly knew what evidence was coming.  They knew it was part of our case.  It couldn't be more explicit.  

If we were going to plead everything that every witness said in the indictment, the indictment would be 500 pages long.  At one point the indictment was well over a hundred pages long, and we endeavoured to streamline it.  Now, in streamlining the indictment and making our theory of the case much clearer, I don't think the Prosecution should be penalised for not having two sentences in an indictment to provide a window for the volumes of information that are included in the witness statements and the pre-trial brief and the will-say and all the other disclosures that have been part of this case.  

So we're on a formalistic point which is really not -- this issue, as fundamental as it is -- is for this case, should not turn on a minor point of formality.  Clearly, the Defence had notice.  And when we -- when the Court looks at this issue, as they will since this is the third or fourth objection on this point, we have to think about the future of this trial.  

This is the third -- fourth witness in this case.  Every witness that testifies is going to give rise to this type of objection because we cannot -- we cannot -- it's not practical to plead every single allegation of fact from a witness in the indictment.  The fundamental issue is has the Defence been placed on notice.  And I can state, unequivocally, that notice was given, and Mr. Robinson concedes as much.  
(Pages 37 to 57 by Ann Burum)




























1530H 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Webster, what about the 1990 meeting which Mr. Robinson says is not referred to anywhere? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
The 1990 meeting is negligible, Your Honour.  It is simply to provide a narrative structure for the evidence which is much more on point, with regard to the 1992 meeting that this witness attended and the other meetings that he was aware of because of the coming and goings of the participants.  So, if the Court wants to exclude evidence of the 1990 meeting in its assessment of this witness's testimony of the evidence, it is not a problem, because there is -- we don't rely on the 1990 meeting to prove our case.  But if we want to look at this witness's evidence in context and provide this Trial Chamber with a basis to appreciate the whole -- the entire narrative of his experience in Gisenyi from 1990 to 1994, I think it would be important to hear everything he has to say.  How he -- we are not using the 1990 meeting to hold the Accused responsible for the events of 1994; but it is part of the narrative line of this witness's testimony. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Sow. 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I think the issue raised by Counsel Robinson is an old problem which we have been grappling with since the beginning of the trial.  We think that the indictment is the basis of the charges brought against the accused persons.  Counsel for the Prosecution is using a method which involved -- or amounts to acts adding facts to the indictment at every turn.  Facts that have nothing to do with the indictment, and saying at every turn, arguing at every turn that we have been put on notice.  My legal question is this: can one amend the indictment on the basis of new facts which have come up, and that on the basis of facts which were not contained in the indictment?  

There is another issue we need to take into account; the time constraints.  Each time the Prosecution adds new facts, it is not surprising that we take so much time with one witness.  The manner in which the Prosecution is leading its evidence will always lead us into this kind of situation.  So, it is important that the ruling be made so we know how we are proceeding.  An expression used by counsel is, on which foot we are going to walk, if not to say to dance.   
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Just a few words, Mr. President, just a third little voice to tell you that I would like to associate myself to these comments that have been made by my learned colleagues, Robinson and Sow on this recurring problem of the indictment.  And the issues that the Prosecution deals with with each witness and these arguments that keep coming.

Now, to say that the fact that meetings are mentioned in the indictment is not sufficient to allow us, or allow him to get these witnesses to testify on these meetings that we were not notified about.  We, who also need to prepare our defence, our cross-examination, and we need to go and find witnesses who have to come and speak, or testify to meetings -- the meeting of 1990, whereas this -- this meeting did not appear at all in the indictment.  This is a problem that keeps popping up.  

So, Your Honours, I strongly wish that we find a solution to this so that we don't keep coming back to it.  We did not rise to our feet on each occasion to support Counsel Robinson, but we fully share in his arguments.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, if I may, I would like to introduce the newest member of our team and ask her to respond briefly to the points that have been raised by the Defence. 
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
If it pleases you, Mr. President, I have listened to the submission on both sides.  To the extent that the Appeals Chamber has pronounced on the matter, I would seek to comment to the Trial Chamber the learning as I appreciate it at this stage.

We are here concerned, Mr. President, with the submission that the evidence that is being led has not been sufficiently pleaded in the indictment to the degree of specificity that is required.  And it is my submission, Mr. President, that at this stage of the proceedings, where the Trial Chamber has such a submission on the deliberation, the principle that should guide the Chamber has been enunciated by the Appeals Chamber in the Rutaganda case.  

I would refer Your Lordships to paragraph 303, and more specifically, to the line that begins "Before holding that an event charged is immaterial or that there are minor discrepancies between the indictment and the evidence presented at trial, a Chamber must normally satisfy itself that no prejudice shall, as a result, be caused to the Accused."  It goes on to say, Mr. President: "Depending on the specific circumstances of each case, the question to be determined is whether an accused was reasonably able to identify the crime and the criminal conduct alleged in each of the paragraphs of the indictment."

It is the opinion of the Appeals Chamber, Mr. President, expressed at paragraph 302 of the said judgement, that: "The indictment cannot have the degree of specificity of the evidence that underpins it."  And I believe also, Mr. President, this is the dicta also pronounced by the Trial Chamber in the Niyitegeka case citing the judgement in Ntakirutimana and Kupreskic.  

The Court points out that, "A distinction has to be made between sufficient notice of an allegation, and sufficient notice of the details of the allegation."  And it goes on to say, that; "A witness may provide previously undisclosed details during the testimony." 

It is my submission, therefore, Mr. President, in the circumstances of the case, the Accused cannot argue that they have been prejudiced in that they're taken by surprise by this evidence that is being alleged.  My learned senior has pointed out the various aspects of the witness statement and the pre-trial brief which has amply notified the Defence of the evidence that is to be led from the witness.

In the circumstances of the case, Mr. President, it is my submission that the evidence is admissible and there is sufficient jurisprudence for the Court to so find.  May it please you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we thank you for these arguments.  And I think that these arguments are roughly the same as we have heard earlier today on a matter which we have already decided to take under advisement, and we will add this to the matters that we are considering.  

I must say that I don't think there is need to get too excited over the issue of defects in the indictment, because this never goes away.  And we will be considering it right up to the time when we write our decision.

It is time for our afternoon break.  We will rise for (inaudible) minutes.  
(Court recessed from 1540H to 1555H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can continue now. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right, Mr. Witness, we are going to pick up with our line of questioning on the meetings that were held at location A.  Let's start with what you have identified previously as the second meeting.  Can you tell us what transpired?  How did you become aware of the meeting that you described taking place in the second half of 1992? 
A.	For the second (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed in closed session) meeting, Mr. Prosecutor --  
Q.	I'm going to ask that the record make -- that the two references to the location that the witness just made be removed to the record.  And we will refer to that location consistently as location A. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The order has already been made.  
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I expect that it will be continued. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, I'm going to ask you to refer to the place where you were working more consistently as location A.  And I will remind you if we slip in any way, but let's try to do that.  So, with respect to the meetings that were held at location A, the one that was held in the second half of 1992, how did you become aware of this meeting and what were you able to observe? 
A.	Regarding the meeting that took place at point A, Mr. Prosecutor, I would say that I was present at  point A.  And this was at the time that I had finished my work.  I was relaxing outside of my office, and I was seated in front of my office.  And those who came to meet at point A met in the ******************
*************************
When they started the meeting I was seated in front of the building, in front of the window of the first hall, and it is from there that I followed in a general manner what was happening in that hall.  It was a meeting that was chaired by Colonel Théoneste Bagosora.  And among the participants were            Mr. Joseph Nzirorera, Mugu -- Leon Mugesera, Habiyambere, Joseph, the sous-préfet from the Gisenyi sous préfecture called Bikumbi.  Mr. Come Bizimungu, Robert Kajuga.  There was one retired colonel, whose name I can't -- I will recall later on.  It was Major Ngendahimana.  There was Major Ntabakuze.  The colonel that I referred to a little earlier was called Colonel Buregeya, Mr. Kajelijeli. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
For the record may I clarify the spelling -- 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. WEBSTER:
Mr. Witness, if you can hold on one second, I will allow you to continue in a moment.  I'm just going to clarify for the record that reference was made to Mugesera, who is number 51 on our list.  Habiyambere who is number 30 on our list;  Buregeya, who is number 20 on our list;  Bikumbi, who is number 10 on the list;  Kajuga, number 40 on our list; Ngendahimana, which is number 60 on our list; Bizimungu Come, who does not appear on our list but the spelling, is fairly straight forward; Ubarijoro, who is number 82 on our list; Ntabakuze, who is number 66 on our list; Kajelijeli, who is number 39 on our list; and the Accused, Nzirorera, and Bagosora. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, you were -- I believe you were going to add a few more names.  Would you like to do that now?  
A.	There was Mr. Barayagwiza. 
Q.	Do you recall if Nsengiyumva was present? 
A.	Colonel Anatole Nsengiyumva was also present. 
Q.	What about the préfet Zigiranyirazo, was he present? 
A.	The préfet Zigiranyirazo was present, and I think that is all. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
For the record Zigiranyirazo, is at 85 on our list.  Barayagwiza is at 8 on our list.  And Nsengiyumva is 65 on our list. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right, Mr. Witness, when you say that you had finished work and was taken a rest, do you recall what time of day that was? 
A.	It was around midday. 
Q.	Now, did everyone arrive at the same time, or did you see people arriving at different times? I would like us all to develop a picture of what you saw and what you heard.  So if you could tell us how things transpired, who arrived, what you saw happening, anything that you heard? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, the participants to the meeting did not arrive all at the same time, they arrived separately.  When I got out of my office some of them were already in the hall, and others kept coming.  And there are others who -- who came but were -- were taking a stroll in the inner courtyard.  Later on when they realised that all of the participants had arrived, they started their meeting.  

And during that meeting, which was chaired by Colonel Bagosora, I personally heard the colonel say that there was a plan to exterminate -- there is a plan by the Tutsi to exterminate the Hutus; and that they had to do everything to counter that, that they needed to pre-empt -- they needed to pre-empt that and make sure that the plan did not succeed.  He made other comments which I did not hear clearly.  I did not hear everything.  Generally, that is what I heard.  He went on to say that they needed to pre-empt the Tutsi action by exterminating them.  

There were some people who also took the floor and gave their views.  After the colonel's intervention, there was Joseph Nzirorera who said that a Tutsi would not succeed in their unimaginable dream, and that he agreed with him that they should not be left to go on with their plan.  

There was another person who took the floor, this was Nsengiyumva.  Among those who took the floor, Nsengiyumva said that those people were playing with fire and that we are going to show them and their nature.  There was Mugesera, Leon, who also took the floor.  He first of all thanked the participants and Colonel Bagosora.  He went on to say that he was also aware of this plan, and that he and his people were not going to allow the Tutsi to succeed in their plan.  

There was also the sous-préfet Bikumbi who took the floor at some point in time and made reference to the Gisenyi préfecture, and Rubavu, more specifically, which is in  the Goma border area.  He said that specific attention should be accorded to that part of the country, because it was a part that was exposed, open to infiltration of the Tutsis who could cross from Goma and carry out criminal activities in Gisenyi and Rubavu, which was the capital of Gisenyi.  

Mr. Kajelijeli also took the floor and spoke specifically about Ruhengeri.  He said in MUKINGO, his commune, there was not much of a problem.  There was no problem, that the work had been done.  And that if there should be any infiltration or any problems, that would come from outside.

There were other speakers who followed to address the meeting, but I did not listen to all of the interventions.  And at the end of the meeting, at the end of their meeting Colonel Bagosora went out with all of the others, and went past the canteen.  But he in particular, together with Colonel Nsengiyumva, entered my office.  And there Colonel Nsengiyumva introduced me to Colonel Bagosora.

He spoke a bit about the **********************************************.  He then invited me to the canteen to have a drink with them.  And there, groups were formed because the canteen was not very spacious, so many people preferred to stand, to remain standing, and were served while standing.  So there were small groups, I believe based on their desire to speak with each other.  

For example, there was a group that I saw.  It was Bikumbi who was there, sous-préfet, there was Nsengiyumva and Bagosora, and also Bambira (phonetic).  And in that group they were discussing what happened among them at the meeting.  And people like Mugesera who were speaking openly about extermination of the Tutsi, and -- as a way of ensuring that they don't succeed in their plan.  

At the end of -- at the end everybody left.  And the following day, Mugesera and Habiyambere, Joseph went to Kayove in the Kayove commune of the Gisenyi prefecture.  They went the                   Lieutenant Bizumuremyi and Major Kabera.  When they got there, according to the two officers of the opts camp they held a meeting at the communal office with the bourgmestre.

At the end of the meeting they, the two officers came back to Kayove, the following day and        Lieutenant Bizabarimana told me that after the Mugesera meeting, Habiyambere, Joseph, and the bourgmestre invited the conseiller of the secteur, because in Rwanda the commune are made up of various secteurs; that was the administrative set up there.  The bourgmestre called the conseiller de secteur meeting and spoke to them about the Mugesera meeting.  The agenda of the meeting was to explain to them the existing Tutsi plan, the Tutsi of the outside to exterminate the Hutus.  
Q.	Thank you for your response.  We are going to talk a bit about what you have just said.  You seem to be giving us an account of two separate meetings; one that you observed at location A and another that you heard about afterwards the next day somewhere in Kayove; is that accurate? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	All right.  We are going to talk about both of them in more detail, but let stick with the meeting at location A for a few more minutes.  Do you recall if Barayagwiza addressed the group, or did you hear him address the group when you were there? 
A.	Yes, I recall that Barayagwiza also took the floor, but I have no clear recollection of what he said, but like the other speakers, he also gave his point of view. 
Q.	To the best of your recollection, how long did this meeting last?  Do you have any recollection of how long these people were together, talking to one another? 
A.	Regarding the duration, I would say that I did not pay attention to that; but they closed sometime during the middle of the afternoon. 
Q.	From what you could over hear, did you get a sense that there was any opposition from other members of the group that had gathered to the things that Bagosora and Nzirorera and Mugesera the others were saying?  Did you get a sense of opposition or discussion amongst the participants? 
A.	No, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Were you outside of that meeting for the entire period of the meeting?  Give us a sense of your movements if there were any, because I would like the Court to understand what you observed and how you were able to observe it. 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I was not seated at that place in front of the window all of the time.  But for the time -- for the period that I was there, that was when I was able to listen to these discussions and presentations.  There were -- probably there were others, because that is -- because other discussions that took place, but since I was not sitting there all the way to the end, I did not follow that, I might have moved to my office or somewhere else because I was not particularly interested in that meeting. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you receive any advanced notice of the meeting?  In other words, before you see -- you saw the participants arrive, did you know that the meeting was going to take place? 
A.	No, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Was there any discussion between you and any of the other officers in Gisenyi after the meeting concerning what transpired at that meeting?  In other words, you have told us that you had discussions at the officers' mess and that you spoke to Bizabarimana about the going ons in Gisenyi.  Were there any conversations after the fact of this meeting concerning what transpired during that meeting?
A.	Yes, after the meeting I heard a conversation with Lieutenant Bizabarimana and the Préfet Bikumbi, who was also present. 
Q.	Did those discussions reveal any further information to you in regard to the meeting, or in regard to previous meetings? 
A.	I don't think so, Mr. Prosecutor, except that my discussions with those two persons enabled me to know more about the purpose of that meeting. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you have any conversation with anyone else in the canteen?  In other words, you told us that you spoke to Bagosora, and to Nsengiyumva in your office.  Did you have any other conversations with any other participants in the canteen after the meeting? 
A.	Yes, at the canteen, I approached Bizabarimana and sous-préfet Bikumbi`s group.  And I had a discussion with them.  And it was the sous-préfet Bikumbi who was pointing out certain persons that I didn't know to me.  We were, the three of us, the sous-préfet, Bizabarimana and myself were discussing during that period. 
Q.	Up until that time, had you seen other gatherings at location A where civilians came on to the location for any purpose? 
A.	No, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	You mentioned a meeting that was held the next day in Kayove, how did you learn about that meeting? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, this information was brought to me by Lieutenant Bizumuremyi and Major Kabera at the ops camp. 
MR. WEBSTER:
	I believe the witness was referring to Bizumuremyi, which we have already indicated is number 17 on our list, and Kabera was the second name, if I am not mistaken; number 35 on our list.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And would you confirm that for us, Mr. Witness that you referred to two officers Bizumuremyi, and state the name of the second person that you mention? 
A.	I was referring to Bizumuremyi, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	And the other name, because I don't think it came up very clearly from the interpretation in English? 
A.	It was Lieutenant Bizumuremyi and Major Kabera. 
Q.	When did they tell you about the meeting in Kayove, was it the same day, the next day, or some time after that? 
A.	The day after the (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) meeting, they came back -- well, I meant point A they came back, and in the evening at the mess we discussed this.  And when they came back the following day.  On two occasions, they came back.  They had a mission in the Kayove commune.  They came back on two different occasions.  That is once after the first time they left.  And he gave me information, information on that occasion, as well, regarding the meeting between the bourgmestre and the conseiller, and then the conseiller with members of their secteur. 
Q.	And if I understood your earlier answer, I believe you stated that Mugesera addressed the group -- or the local authorities in Kayove, was that your evidence? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  He addressed the bourgmestre of the Kayove commune.
Q.	Did anything happen as a result of that meeting in Kayove? 
A.	After Bizumuremyi and Major Kabera got back for the last time, after they completed their mission in Kayove, there were some uprisings, instances of uprising, opposing the Hutu and Tutsi of Kayove.  The following day, when we went there with Lieutenant Munyaburanga at the Gisenyi hospital, we met people at the hospital, and there was one who had wounds on the head.  

We got interested in him and asked him what happened to him.  He explained that he saw people fleeing, and others were screaming.  And when he wanted to get out to see what was happening, somebody came to him and hit him on the head with a machete, and that is how -- that is how come we understood that there were certain -- there were instances in Kayove.

THE WITNESS: (continuing)  
Later on, there was a rumour going around that the Hutus rose up against the Tutsi in Kayove, looted their houses.  We saw the gendarme at Kayove, and the officer S2, who went there to restore peace, also came to us.  He spoke to us about the situation at the mess of the ops command.  He spoke about the Hutus who rose up against the Tutsi, that some were killed by machete, houses were torched, people fled, and livestock looted, but that they were able to restore calm.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	For the record, the witness mentioned an officer Munyaburanga, it's number 54 on the list.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you also refer to the S2 officer when you were telling us about what transpired in Kayove.  Were they one and the same when you made reference to the S2 officer, were you referring to Munyaburanga, or to someone else?  
A.	No, Mr. Prosecutor.  The S2 I was referring to was the S2 of the gendarmerie, who was an intelligence officer, a military intelligence officer for the préfecture, for the Gisenyi gendarmerie.  And he's separated from the S2 of the Gisenyi ops.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you tell us that the gendarmerie were able to calm the situation, or restore calm, what do you mean by that?  In other words, based on what you observed, or what the other officers told you, did the gendarmes intervene in order to prevent the Hutu from rising up against the Tutsi, or to target the Tutsi, or to separate the two groups?  It's really not clear from your previous statement exactly what the role of the gendarmerie was in that incident.  Maybe you could make that more explicit for us.  
A.	I think the gendarmerie went to Kayove at that time, and I think it was rather to support the Hutus and quell this resistance which was apparent from the Tutsi side.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, when you use the word "resistance", it's not clear to me what you mean.  How did the Tutsi resist?  What are you referring to when you say "resistance"?  
A.	The Tutsis had been attacked, but some of them were trying to defend themselves and to flee, or to hide.  And when the gendarmerie came, they had come to break the resistance of the small group of Tutsis who were trying to defend themselves.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm trying to situate the two meetings that you've described in time.  And I'm going to ask you if you recall a famous speech that was made by President Habyarimana in Ruhengeri.  Does that event come to mind for you?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I still have a vague recollection of that, but no detailed recollection. 
Q.	It's a matter of record in this case that that speech took place on the 15th of November 1992.  Hearing that date from me at this time, does that seem to confirm with your idea -- excuse me.  Bearing -- let me withdraw that question and begin again.  

Okay, bearing in mind the speech that Habyarimana made in Ruhengeri, do you recall whether the meeting at location A took place before or after that speech?  
A.	The meeting at point A took place before the president's meeting (sic) in Ruhengeri.  
Q.	Would you be able to estimate how much time before the president's speech the meeting at location A took place, if you're able to estimate?  
A.	I'm not very certain about the date, but it was well before that speech was delivered.  In any case, it was during the same month.  
Q.	It's a matter of record in this case that the speech made by President Habyarimana in Ruhengeri, that generated a lot of commentary across the country, took place on the 15th of November 1992.  Would that date, the 15th of November, seem reasonable to you, in light of your recollection of events, as situating Habyarimana's speech and the meeting at location A that took place sometime before that speech?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, the meeting at point A took place well ahead of that period, well before that time.  But I am not able to say exactly how much time had gone by between those two meetings.  
Q.	Your previous responses made reference to Mugesera.  Mugesera also made a speech that generated a lot of commentary in the country, and I believe that speech was made in Kayove.  Do you recall that as an event?  
A.	Yes, I do have a general recollection of it, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	Do you know if that speech made by Mugesera was made before or after that meeting that he held in Kayove that you referred to earlier.  In other words, the meeting that Kabera and Bizumuremyi told you about Kayove, was that before or after the speech that generated national attention?  
A.	That speech was delivered well before the Mugesera speech, Mr. Prosecutor -- rather, the meeting at point A took place well before the meeting held by the president of the Republic in Ruhengeri, and that of Mugesera in Kabaya (phonetic) sub-préfecture in Gisenyi. 
Q.	It's a matter of record in this case that the speech of Mugesera, that generated much national commentary, took place on the 22nd of November 1992.  Would that seem consistent with your recollection of events?  Are we -- do you think we are talking about the same incident, now that I've mentioned that date to you?  
A.	I do not think so, Mr. Prosecutor.  In Kabaya sub-préfecture, in (unintelligible), where Kayove commune is located, several events occurred between 1992 and 1994.  Maybe another event occurred at that time, but it is different from that which occurred after the meeting at point A.  It would be a different event.  You see, several events occurred and not just a single event.  And as several people have observed these events, they probably did not identify all of them.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, when you refer to the date the 22nd of November 1992, I'm referring to the speech by Mugesera that was broadcast on the radio, and that generated quite a bit of discussion in the country.  That's the event that you said you had some sense of its occurrence, globally speaking.  So, when I say 22nd of November, that's the incident that I'm referring to.  
Now, my question to you is, acknowledging the 22nd of November as the date of that famous speech by Mugesera, can you tell us if the other speeches or the meeting in Kayove took place before or after the 22nd of November 1992?  Do you understand my question?  
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  I have already mentioned that the meeting at point A, and the events that followed that meeting, took place well before the speech delivered by Léon Mugesera.  
Q.	Now, if we direct our attention to Habyarimana's speech, the one that the president made in Ruhengeri, did that speech generate any discussion in the officers' mess, or among the officers that you frequented in Gisenyi?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I'm going to object to that on relevance grounds.  We've had lots of information about this meeting and know exactly its content from the video.  I don't see any purpose to eliciting information about what was discussed about that meeting by this witness and fellow officers.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, the line of enquiry is not to extract what was said at the meeting, but what the response -- excuse me, not what was said in the speech, but what the reaction to the speech was in the military circles that this witness frequented in Gisenyi at that time.  So, I would suggest that it's a legitimate line of enquiry.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The question is allowed. 
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. Prosecutor, would you please kindly repeat the question.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Recalling the speech that President Habyarimana made in Ruhengeri, were you present for that speech?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I did not hear that speech over radio with my own ears, but subsequently I heard the comments that were made at the officers' mess, and those who had heard the speech told me that he was talking generally about those people with whom he would go about at the appointed time, and that he was going to win.  So, as officers, and in our milieu, we did not know what those people, that is, the people of his party with whom he would go down, that would be people of the MRND and the Interahamwe, so -- well, as soldiers, we understood that when the president of the Republic will issue the order for MRND party members and supporters to go down into the streets, or get out into the streets at the given or appointed time, the purpose would be to get rid of the Ibiyitso, and the remaining Tutsis who would be there at that time.  And that when all of those elements would have been neutralised, then the victory at the battlefront will be complete.  

You know that, at that time, the units which were at the battlefront needed support from within, because they were saying that all the military plans for attacks and advances on the battlefront were somehow disclosed by the accomplices through radio messages, through spies, and by other infiltrators who went from one place to another.  So, there were several versions of what was going on at that time.  So, when President Habyarimana talked about those people of his party who will go down the sound -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says the witness.
THE WITNESS: 
-- that this will be the opportune moment for certain actions to take place.  And that was the interpretation that we had at the ops Gisenyi, and at the Gisenyi préfectoral office, among the people whom I frequented.       
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Well, the conversations that you had concerning this speech, do you know if they took place on the day that the speech was made, or the next day, or -- can you give us some sense of when your conversations with the officers took place?  Was it right after the speech, or some time -- after the passage of some time?  
A.	It was not immediately after the speech.  I cannot put my finger on a specific time frame.  You see, when the speech was delivered, I did not listen to it over radio; I was at work.  I don't know at what time it was delivered, but when I got back to the officers' mess in the evening -- it might have been the next day, that is, the day after the speech -- that is when I heard these conversations and those discussions.  And the various discussions continued in the same line.  
Q.	Directing our attention now to the speech that Léon Mugesera made, the one that generated national commentary.  Did you hear that speech yourself? 
A.	When Mugesera's speech was broadcast over radio, I did not hear it with my own ears, Mr. Prosecutor, on that day, but I learnt about it subsequently.  I heard comments and observations about the speech, and these were made by those who had heard the speech over radio, saying that Mugesera had talked about Tutsis and had said that Tutsi were not Rwandans, that they had come from Ethiopia, and that they should be sent back to Ethiopia -- beheaded.  

For us, and for those who were there, and for the officers who were having these discussions at the ops Gisenyi, this meant that it was a good thing, namely, that if Tutsis were to go back to Ethiopia, or -- and their accomplices were to go back to Ethiopia, or to any other country, beheaded, that was a good thing, because it was going to put an end to the complicity so that there may be complete victory at the battlefront.  So, that was the point of view that was the nature of the discussions that one heard at the officers' mess.  

Within circles outside of Gisenyi, in other circles which I also frequented, this was the prevailing opinion, namely, that Tutsis from within should be completely eliminated in order to wipe out any complicity so that victory may be accomplished in the war at that time.  
Q.	Well, concerning these conversations that you had at the mess, can you think of any particular officers with whom you had these discussions, to the extent that you can remember?  
A.	I do recollect that at the officers' mess there was Lieutenant Bizumuremyi, Lieutenant Rwasa, Lieutenant Munyaburanga as well was there, there was also a major known as Habyarimana who had stopped over at the camp and was not there for a long time.  But Lieutenant Rwasa, Lieutenant Munyaburanga, and Lieutenant Bizumuremyi were in my company when we had those discussions.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
For the record, Lieutenant Rwasa can be found at number 74 on our list, Munyaburanga can be found at number 54, and Bizumuremyi, we've indicated several times, can be found at number 17.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	When you talk about the complicity being eliminated within Rwanda, Mr. Witness, can you explain that to us a bit further?  What was it -- when you say the complicity was going to be eliminated, explain to us what you mean by that?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, complicity refers to some kind of understanding between the Tutsis from within and those who were abroad.  So, there was a presumption, and -- that this did exist, but personally I don't know whether it was true or not.  But, within the circles of officers at ops Gisenyi, almost everybody was convinced that the Tutsi within the country were in agreement with their brothers abroad, and that everything happening at the battlefront, or within the country in respect of preparation for war, was indeed disclosed prior to any execution thereof.  

Let me take an example from 1993, towards the end of 1993, when the war was very intense in Ruhengeri préfecture, in the volcanic areas, in those chains of mountains.  What happened was that, when troops were sent to that area, it was often said that the troops were ambushed, that some came back with -- without their limbs because they were ambushed, or they had been trapped and had run into some land mines.  And all of that made the officers who remained at the camp to come to the conclusion that it was not possible for this to happen without people disclosing, or betraying, the plans of the soldiers.  Because, it is not possible to plant land mines or grenades at any location if you do not know in advance that the troops are going to be using this itinerary.  

So, there were many arguments, or many factors which led the officers in ops Gisenyi to come to the position that those accomplices, those people who were accomplices, or who were said to be accomplices, and who were Tutsi from within, and a few Hutu who were friends of those Tutsis, that they needed to eliminate these people in order to ensure military victory at the battlefront.  
Q.	Thank you.  Do you recall any other meetings that were held at location A?  In other words, after the meeting that you explained to us took place in 1992, tell us about the next meeting that you're aware of that took place at location A.  
A.	After 1992, I heard at the officers' mess that a meeting had held in early 1993 at location A.  I did not delve much into that particular meeting, but again the officers at the mess were Lieutenant Rwasa, Lieutenant Bizumuremyi, and Munyaburanga, who was bourgmestre (as interpreted).  When they talked of these meetings, they referred to the various problems at the war front, as well as to the enemy resistance.  
Q.	Well, with regard to that meeting in the first part of 1993 -- 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, just a question of translation from that last answer.  I thought there was a reference to the bourgmestre in that -- the English that we received, and I was wondering if that's correct.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I can ask the witness to clarify that.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in your previous response you mentioned Rwasa, who is number 74 on our list, Bizumuremyi, number 17 on our list, and Munyaburanga, number 54 on our list.  But it seemed you also used the word bourgmestre, and we're trying to understand that connection.  Can you go over that portion of your testimony again, please.  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I do not quite understand your question.  
Q.	We heard, in English, the word bourgmestre.  And I'm wondering if that's accurate, or if there's an issue with the translation.  Can you clarify to us -- for us, who was it that told you about the meeting that was held at location A in the first part of 1993?  
A.	I talked about the officers at the mess, the officers' mess at ops Gisenyi, and I said that there was Lieutenant Munyaburanga, Lieutenant Rwasa, and Lieutenant Bizumuremyi.  Those are the officers who had the discussion among themselves about that meeting.  
Q.	Do you know if that discussion took place on the same day that the meeting was held?  And, if not, how long after the meeting did that discussion take place?  
A.	I think it was the day after the meeting, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	Did you yourself observe anything in relation to the meeting?  In other words, are you an eyewitness to anything that concerned the meeting in the first half of 1993?  
A.	At the meeting in early '93, I noticed movements, people going and coming at the camp, but I did not witness the meeting myself because I was not very interested in it.  But the information relating thereto, I gathered it at the officers' mess. 
Q.	And in terms of the content of the meeting, the discussion that transpired, did the officers say anything to you about what was discussed at that meeting?  
A.	They didn't give me details of everything that transpired at the meeting, but, globally speaking, they told me about the problems encountered at the war front in Byumba and Ruhengeri préfectures, as well as enemy resistance at the battlefront.  That was all I was able to follow, because I really did not pay much interest in that meeting, and for that reason I didn't get any further information.  
Q.	Do you know if civilians participated in that meeting? 
A.	The officers told me that civilians and soldiers did indeed participate in that meeting. 
Q.	Do you know who presided that meeting?  
A.	According to the officers who were present, the meeting was chaired by Mr. Barayagwiza. 
Q.	Do you know if there was any discussion about the complicity of the Tutsi within Rwanda during that particular meeting?  
A.	No, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	All right, let's turn our attention to the next meeting at location A that you were aware of.  Do you know when the very next meeting that you knew about took place?  
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	When was that?  
A.	The next meeting, held in the second half of 1993, in the month of August or thereabouts. 
Q.	Did you observe that meeting yourself, or did somebody tell you about it afterwards?  
A.	No, Mr. Prosecutor, I wasn't an eyewitness to that meeting. 
Q.	How did you learn about it? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Witness said "fourth meeting". 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Yes, I'm asking you to tell us about how you learned about the fourth meeting.  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I found out about the fourth meeting at the officers' mess at ops Gisenyi. 
Q.	Was there discussion of the meeting on the same day that it was held, or was there -- was it some time thereafter?  
A.	It was a few days after. 
Q.	Who was it that told you about the meeting? 
A.	Once again, Lieutenant Bizumuremyi talked to me, generally, about the content of that meeting.  And once again he said it was on war-related problems.  
Q.	Did he tell you who presided the meeting? 
A.	Yes.  According to Lieutenant Bizumuremyi, it was Colonel Bagosora who chaired that fourth meeting at location A. 
Q.	Do you know if civilians participated in that meeting? 
A.	I was not interested in that aspect, Mr. Prosecutor, and I didn't ask to know whether there was civilians or soldiers at the meeting.  
Q.	You mentioned another meeting that you were aware of at (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and placed under seal) -- at location A afterwards.  The fifth meeting.  Can you tell us what you know about the fifth meeting at location A?  
A.	The fifth and last meeting I was able to gather information was one which I did not attend personally.  I found out about it, once again, at the officers' mess, and according to the officers who were there, Lieutenant Bizumuremyi told me of the discussions at that last meeting focussing on military problems.  He told me that this meeting was one that dealt, basically, with military problems, such as recruiting new soldiers into the army in order to provide support for the troops at the battlefront.  
(Pages 67 to 74 by Kirstin McLean)


































1715H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Was there any discussion of the militias during the course of that meeting based on what Bizumuremyi told you? 
A.	I do not think that there were any discussions on the militia at that time, but he talked about recruiting soldiers, the problem of recruiting soldiers. 
Q.	Was there any other meeting in Gisenyi that you're aware of that involved participation of Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	Yes.  After this meeting in -- that took place at point A, towards the end of 1993, a meeting took place at the Meridien hotel, Gisenyi.  That meeting involved Mr. Nzirorera and Nziramwe (phonetic) of Gisenyi.  

And according to Lieutenant Bizumuremyi, during that meeting Mr. Nzirorera had on his agenda for the meeting the support that the Interahamwe had to give the Gisenyi armed forces so as to be able to deal with the internal complicity and flush out all the accomplices in Gisenyi, as well as those they referred to as "Ibiyitso."  

During the meeting, the meeting that took place at the Meridien, Nzirorera left.  The leaders of the militia group came.  There was Omar Serushago.  There was Bernard, who was there as well.  There were also members of the CDR.  There was Mabuye and one Michel, who came to the camp together with the other group leaders.  

And in front of the camp, on the tarmac of the camp, they distributed weapons to these leaders of the militia groups who came to the camp.  And by Lieutenant Bizumuremyi, they were also giving Motorola radios on the same day. 
MR. WEBSTER:
For the record, the witness mentioned the following names:  Mabuye, which can be found at number 46 on our list.  Michel, Omar, Damas, the last three names are not on the list, but I'm assuming the spellings should be easy enough.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	You mentioned a certain Bernard, Mr. Witness.  Can you clarify who that witness is?  Does he go by another name that you've already mentioned? 
A.	Bernard's name is Munyagishari, and he was the chief of the leader of the militia group in Gisenyi.  He was the main leader because there were smaller groups who had their own leaders.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Munyagishari is number 55 on our list. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  Concerning the distribution of weapons that you observed, you mentioned that this took place at a camp.  I'd like you to clarify which camp this was, please.  
A.	The weapons were Mach 4.  I don't know if that is how they are referred to everywhere in the world, but that's how we called them in Gisenyi.  They called -- they are called R4 assault weapons.  

They were distributed.  They were brought out of the weapons depot of the Gisenyi camp, and it was Lieutenant Bizumuremyi who distributed the weapons on the tarmac in front of his office, which was located in ops Gisenyi.  
Q.	And with respect to Nzirorera, did you see him yourself at that time, or did you just hear about his presence at the Hotel Meridien? 
A.	When Mr. Nzirorera closed his meeting with the Interahamwe at the Meridien, he came to ops Gisenyi.  The commander who was Colonel Nsengiyumva, I don't know how long they stayed in his office.  They then went to the mess, the officers' mess.  I believe they had a drink there, and then he left.  

It was the following day that the weapons were distributed at the Gisenyi ops camp.  
Q.	Did you see Mr. Nzirorera yourself, or is this something that someone else told you? 
A.	I saw him myself because I was there in the camp. 
Q.	Do you know if there was any other distribution of weapons around that same time?  You told us about the distribution to these leaders of the militias, and I'm asking you were you aware of, or did you observe, any other arms distribution during that same period? 
A.	During that period in 1993, there was no other distribution, but it was after April that there was another distribution of weapons at the headquarters of the 47th battalion, led by Major Habyarimana, which was based close to the lake, close to the corniche customs post, and that was done in the presence of Mr. Nzirorera. 
Q.	But with respect to the distribution in front of the 42nd (sic) battalion, are you recounting events that transpired in 1993 or in 1994? 
A.	I'm talking about events that occurred after 1993. 
Q.	I'd like to stick to the period very close in time to the meeting that took place at the Meridien hotel towards the end of 1993.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I want to make a motion to strike the reference to Mr. Nzirorera's presence at the distribution of weapons, which seems like it was testified to have occurred in 1994, after 
6th April 1994.  That information appears nowhere in the indictment.  

It's been held that a distribution of weapons in an Accused's presence at the distribution of weapons is a material fact that needs to be in the indictment.  And so I'm objecting on that basis.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, we're getting to the same issue that the Court is -- already has under -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that's what I thought. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yeah. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So I'll just include that in the matters we already have and advisement. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, let's stick close in time to the meeting you described taking place at the Meridien hotel in 1993.  You mentioned that four or five leaders of the militias received arms and radios at ops Gisenyi camp.  Do you know if any other members of the militias also received arms around that same period? 
A.	I'm not aware of any other distribution after the distribution in the camp.  But I think after 1993 -- I cannot recall the exact date.  It must have been late '93, early '94 -- that the distribution of weapons to the Interahamwe took place at the head office -- headquarters of the 47th battalion.  

I have no clear recollection of the date, but it took place -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry.  The witness was not clear, the latter part of his testimony. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you repeat the last portion of your answer, please.  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I was telling you about distribution of weapons which took place at the end of 1993, following the meeting that took place at the Hotel Meridien.  That distribution took place at the Gisenyi ops camp, and the distribution that followed, I said I could not recall the period, the date.  

But there was a distribution that took -- that followed the distribution that took place at the Gisenyi ops camp after the meeting that took place at the Meridien hotel.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, it's -- it's close to 5:30 now, and I'm wondering if we could conclude for today and pick up tomorrow morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just a note that I need to make. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Pardon? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you give me just one moment, please.  

Mr. Webster, we agree we can take the adjournment now.  

Now, in terms of your schedule, you'll finish at -- by 12:30 tomorrow?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I would like to finish by 12:30 tomorrow.  I'm -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping) I know, but what's the reality? 
MR. WEBSTER:
(Microphones overlapping) the reality is it may go a bit beyond that, but I don't think we will go beyond tomorrow.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You mean you anticipate the whole afternoon tomorrow? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm not anticipating the entire afternoon.  I would like to finish by 12:30, but I'm not -- I can't guarantee that, but I don't -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping) but there's a real possibility, then? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  

Okay.  We take the adjournment now. 

Mr. Witness, I suppose I'm repeating myself because, as I've told you before, on this, as on any other adjournment, you remain a witness, and you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  

We take the adjournment until tomorrow morning. 
(Court adjourned at 1733H)
