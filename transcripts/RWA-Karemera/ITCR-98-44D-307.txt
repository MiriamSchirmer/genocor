MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody.

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. DIALLO:
Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding; Gberdao Gustave Kam and Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session, this 
	Wednesday, 19th May 2010, in open session for continuation of the trial in the matter of the 
	Prosecutor versus Édouard Karemera, et al., Case No. ICTR 98-44-T. 

I thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  The appearances are the same.

Good morning, Mr. Nzirorera. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Your testimony continues this morning.  You remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began.  

And Mr. Robinson will continue. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.  

Mr. President, I want to advise you, it doesn't seem like I'm going to be finished with this examination by the end of Thursday, so you may want to give some thought to whether you want to sit on Friday.  But in any event, it's not likely to be completed by the end of Thursday at the current pace. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
JOSEPH NZIRORERA,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, good morning.  
A.	Good morning, Mr. Robinson. 
Q.	Yesterday when we left off we were speaking about the recommendation by the MRND to the government concerning the civil defence.  And I wanted to ask you:  Was the Interahamwe envisioned to be a part of that civil defence by the MRND leadership? 
A.	Counsel, as I told you yesterday, civil defence was a matter for the government and not for a 
	political party.  During that meeting we analysed the situation in which the country found itself and came to the conclusion that from what we had observed, the only thing possible to do was to recommend to government to seek ways and means of protecting the citizens of the country and maintaining the integrity of the country.  That is all that we tried to do.  

Some ministers of the MRND who were present were expected to be our spokespersons before the government, so we did not indicate whether the Interahamwe should be involved or how the 
civil defence movement should be structured.  That was a matter for government.  And that is all I can say. 
Q.	Now, all the killing of civilians that had gone on since the 7th of April, how did that affect the morale of the soldiers of the Rwandan government, if at all?  Do you think it helped them in their fight or distracted them, demoralised them? 
A.	Those reprehensible actions did not favour government or military action. 
Q.	And what about the RPF soldiers, do you think that the killing of their families and relatives gave them extra motivation to fight against the government? 
A.	I believe that the RPF and its troops rather wanted to exploit or take advantage of the war and the chaos that had arisen within the context of the war in order to achieve its objectives.  You see, when the presidential plane was brought down on the 6th of April, it is true that on the government side some killings had been committed, either by members of the population or by those who were generally referred to as the Interahamwe or by some soldiers.  

But, on the other hand, the RPF also committed some terrible acts that cannot even be mentioned, which have not been mentioned today in Kacyiru and Kicukiro and all over.  But maybe -- maybe during cross-examination there would be an opportunity to revisit this issue and to demonstrate that today it cannot only be argued that it was the government alone that committed some acts because the acts of the other party have been disregarded.  And it is not simply correct to look at only one side of the equation and forget the other. 
Q.	Did the fact that members of the population were killing Tutsis and other civilians assist the 
	Rwandan government in its international relations, or did it hinder the Rwandan government's cause? 
A.	I think I have already answered that question, namely, that it was a disservice to the army and to the government.  It did not favour their actions at all.  Unfortunately, when we sought the intervention of the international community to put a halt to the fighting and obtain a ceasefire so that government forces could be released to take care of the perpetrators of the killings, those requests were not heeded in April and even up to the month of July 1994. 
Q.	So if the killings of civilians negatively affected the Rwandan army, positively affected the RPF and brought condemnation to the government from the international community, would there be any reason for you or any other member of the government to be in favour of those killings or want them to continue? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting to the form of that question.  I mean the answer is practically delivered to the witness.  This is basically a rhetorical enquiry.  So the Chamber may find it useful, but I'm objecting to the form. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I can ask it in a different way, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	In May 1994 when you were making recommendations to the government, did you see any possible advantage to the MRND or the government from encouraging killings of civilians? 
A.	Not at all.  What we were seeking was to ensure the defence of the country and the population and as far as possible see how to bring the RPF to the negotiating table.  So that was not our intention.  Such was not the intention when the government sought intervention by UNAMIR and requested that a force be put in place, and this could not in any way have meant that they wanted to increase or intensify the massacres.  It was not at all in the interest of government to see the citizens of its country kill each other.  The MRND was opposed to that. 
Q.	Now, the meeting of the political bureau on the 13th of May -- it ended on the 13th of May -- what did you do after that meeting? 
A.	At the end of the meeting, I have already told you the various items that were on the agenda of that meeting from the 12th to the 13th.  Immediately after the meeting, I left Gitarama and returned to Gisenyi. 
Q.	How long did you remain in Gisenyi? 
A.	I did not remain in Gisenyi for a long time.  When I arrived I stayed there for about two days, and around the 15th I returned to Gitarama, having been informed that government had the intention of sending me on a mission abroad. 
Q.	And with whom did you travel from Gisenyi to Gitarama around the 15th of May? 
A.	When I arrived in Gisenyi, shortly thereafter I learnt that Mathieu had returned from his mission.  We met in Gisenyi.  And if my recollection is correct, we met and I told him about what we had discussed during the meeting of the 12th and 13th.  I believe that Mathieu also decided to travel to Gitarama. 
Q.	And did you travel together? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What did you do when you first arrived at Gitarama on the 15th? 
A.	When we arrived there, it was in the afternoon of the 15th, I believe that having just returned from a mission Mathieu had some commitment to report to those who had sent him on mission.  As for the MRND, Mathieu and I talked about the conclusions that -- rather, Mathieu, Karemera and myself, we talked about the resolutions or findings of our meeting of the 12th and 13th, including among other things the recommendation for the defence of the territory, which we have already talked about.  But we also discussed what I mentioned before, that is, the institutional problems that may have arisen, and then also talked about the various issues that were raised in our communiqué of 13 May 1994.  

But while we were in Gitarama, we also talked about the problem that we had raised pertaining to the replacement of some MRND senior staff who were expected to occupy certain positions, for example, the director of cabinet at the presidency of the republic, who was absent, the minister of interior and communal development.  And so we discussed that issue so that we could take into consideration the recommendations of the political bureau whereby we were expected to act promptly.  But we told them that we could not act on their requests without consulting the interested parties.

But the position of the political bureau was that we act promptly to replace the director of cabinet and the minister of the interior.  We expressed the opinion that it would not be wise to proceed in that manner without consulting the interested parties, Munyazesa and Ruhigira.  

So that is what happened.  But the truth of the matter is that these things did not happen.  We did not come to that decision.  So when Mathieu arrived we talked about this issue as the executive committee in the presence of the -- Mathieu Ngirumpatse, the chairman of the party.  So we came to a number of decisions, which we forwarded to the president of the republic for approval and also to the 
prime minister. 
Q.	And who was decided to replace Munyaneza as minister of the interior? 
A.	During our discussions with President Sindikubwabo in Gitarama, we asked him in person to select a director of cabinet for himself, because it was his right to do so.  He decided to choose 
	Mr. Daniel Mbangura.  I think I have already spelt that name.  M-B-A-N-G-U-R-A, Mbangura, Daniel, who was at the time minister of higher education and scientific research.  

It is in that context that subsequent proposals dealt with the replacement of Mbangura.  And it is 
Jean-de-Dieu who was selected.  Mbangura had been minister of higher education and 
scientific research.  He was replaced by Kamuhanda, who was also a senior civil servant, and he, therefore, replaced Mbangura.  

We suggested, or proposed, that Karemera should become the minister of the interior.  Ruhigira was a native of Kibuye, and we felt that Kibuye should not be slighted to the extent that the MRND always tried to operate some geographical balance in the distribution of positions in order not to slight any region of the country.  
So when you see how positions are apportioned in the MRND, you would realise of the 
11 or 10 positions, each préfecture was represented by some person.  That is how Karemera was selected to become minister of the interior and communal development.  But Ruhigira had defected. 
Q.	Was there any post that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was going to occupy? 
A.	Yes, the proposal was made for Mathieu to be an adviser to the president, special adviser with the rank of minister, of course, special adviser at the presidency of the republic. 
Q.	What about yourself, was there any discussion about you assuming any post? 
A.	At that time I was a member of parliament, and I remained a member of parliament.  And the intention was that if it was possible, I could still run for parliament.  But you know at the time the CND was parliament, that had been set up by the former structures.  But they -- with the advent of the multiparty politics, we felt that after the 90-day deadline had expired without any ceasefire, that if it happened that after the 90 days there was no ceasefire and that the broad-based transitional institutions had not been set up, then maybe I could also run for the presidency of the national assembly in order to occupy the vacancy that would be created in that institution if Sindikubwabo were to be maintained in his position as president of the republic.  

As I told you, when he was appointed in April 1994 he was the interim president but at the same time president of the national assembly.  So we did not quite see what things would look like if the RPF continued to prosecute the war.  There would be a number of vacancies in a number of positions.  

So that was the context in which we discussed these issues and these are the agreements we came to after those discussions with the president of the republic, to whom we submitted our proposals, and he accepted them.

In any event, at the time I left Gitarama to go on mission to South Africa, that was the situation we had agreed to. 
Q.	And why was it, having decided at the beginning of the interim government not to occupy any posts, that the three of you decided to take some posts in May? 
A.	The fact is that at some point President Sindikubwabo felt that he needed some seasoned hands around him, people whom he could contact easily at any time.  That is how things evolved. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us the background of how it was that you came to be asked to go on mission to 
	South Africa? 
A.	First of all, I am not the one who asked to be put on mission to South Africa.  The prime minister's office and the ministry of defence proposed my name.  

Now, at that time what happened was that from the 16th, 17th or 18th, I believe there was some information - and, by the way, the Rwandan armed forces were losing a greater part of the 
national territory.  Secondly, the army argued that they could continue fighting but that they were running out of the ammunition as time went by.  Thirdly, around the 16th or 17th the government was informed that the security council had resolved to impose an embargo on weapons on the 
Rwandan government.  That arms embargo did not affect the RPF or its supporters, including Uganda.

So we understood, after meeting as cabinet, that the die was cast and that we were left with no other option in the face in such decision that would have a deadly impact on the Rwandan government and the Rwandan people.  That is how the idea of resisting, in spite of the arms embargo -- some of these things.  

Give me just a minute to say a thing or two in this regard.  With the outbreak of the war on 
1 October 1990, that war was launched from Uganda by refugees, Tutsi refugees who were living in Uganda.  And the war was a violation or a breach of all international conventions in the matter, including the United Nations charter and OAU charter.  But curiously that invasion from Uganda was never condemned by the international community.  A UN member state attacking another?  And a OAU member state attacking another?  Regardless, as the war was prosecuted in the '90s, from 
1990 to 1994, President Habyarimana always relied on support from the international community and also on the good neighbourly relations that Rwanda had with its neighbours.

Now when the president died, you all know what happened.  But even before then, the issue of the violation of ceasefires by the RPF had always been a problem.  With the arms embargo of 1994, many questions arose in our minds, and as government we did not quite understand what was happening.  That is how the government decided to seek ways and means to maintain some measure of resistance and not have to jump ship suddenly and leave the country.  

You see, that decision of the United Nations Security Council appeared to us, at least to us as 
interim government, at least to us the Rwandan interim government -- it appeared to us to be an unjust decision.  How can you impose an embargo against the government whereas the attacker is continuing to receive supplies from Uganda?  That is how the decision was taken to seek ways and means of acquiring arms and ammunitions in order to continue to fight the war, the RPF war, which had intensified in May 1994.  

That is what I can tell you in broad strokes.  And I'm sorry for taking time to provide some details on this matter. 
Q.	Okay.  But try to keep your answers briefer though.

So can you tell us why it was that you were asked to undertake this mission? 
A.	Yes, I was asked whether it was possible for arms and weapons and ammunition to be obtained and everybody could make a suggestion depending on the knowledge the person had of the business world.  And we were told that we had to do exploration missions first to see whether there were opportunities. 
Q.	Did you know anyone who might be able to assist the Rwandan government in purchasing arms? 
A.	Yes, I was in contact with a number of Zairean politicians who in turn had other contacts.  And these are the people who put us in contact with the person who was in South Africa. 
Q.	So as a result of those contacts that you made, you were given a mission to go to South Africa.  What was the nature of that mission?  What were you actually supposed to do? 
A.	Yes, I was going on an exploratory mission to South Africa to see if it was possible to obtain ammunition, because we had a number of weapons which did not have the necessary ammunition, and we needed them to continue the war.  So this was an exploratory mission to find out if that was possible.  And that is why when I left Gitarama, Kinshasa, South Africa, I left.  I was not given any money.  I was told:  "You go there.  And once you go there, you can give us a report."  But our intermediaries had reassured us that if we had money we could obtain something.  So when this exploratory mission was proposed to me, I accepted it willingly.  

On a personal basis, I was interested in the mission because I had never had the possibility of purchasing clothes for myself and for my children.  And since in Rwanda the shops were closed in Ngoma, it was not possible.  The shops were closed.  I said if I had the possibility of going abroad I can buy for myself a shirt or a suit because I was in a deplorable situation.  So I told myself that might perhaps also be an opportunity for me to find a place where I could find clothes for myself, my wife and my children. 
Q.	Was there a military officer who was to accompany you on this mission? 
A.	Yes.  In that exploratory mission, since I am not a weapons expert, the government included in that delegation a certain Lieutenant Colonel Jean-Bosco Ruhorahoza.  I'll spell that:  R-U-H-O-R-A-H-O-Z-A, Lieutenant Colonel Jean-Bosco Ruhorahoza.  He was an officer in the chief of staff trained as an engineer.  And I was told that we had to undertake that mission together to see what contacts we could establish, and he had to accompany me right to South Africa. 
Q.	And when did you leave Gitarama? 
A.	The mission order was signed on the 17th of May.  And when it was given to me on the 18th I had to complete a number of formalities and it was not easy to have travel allowances and other payments.  

But I left Gitarama on the 22nd of May, if my memory serves me correctly.  I went to Gisenyi.  And the following morning, on the 23rd of May 1994, I crossed the border from Gisenyi to Goma to take a plane to Kinshasa. 
Q.	How long did you stay in Kinshasa? 
A.	About three days, because I left Kinshasa on the 27th of May for South Africa.  And during the 
	three days I spent in Kinshasa, I had to complete the formalities with a view to obtaining a visa into South Africa. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Pardon my interruption.  Are we to understand that the entire period from the 15th of May through the 22nd was spent in Gitarama?  If that could be clarified from the witness, please. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Nzirorera.  Did you spend time from the 15th of May until the 22nd of May in Gitarama? 
A.	Yes, I was in Gitarama.  I told you about the contacts we had and about the problems we had to solve.  When Mathieu arrived there were problems that we had to solve.  We had to see the president.  We had to take a look at all the structures that we had put in place.  So I stayed in Gitarama.  We got there on the 15th and I left on the 22nd, so I spent one week in Gitarama. 
Q.	While you were in Zaire did you see Colonel Bagosora? 
A.	Yes, on the 23rd when I went to Goma airport to take the plane, I found that Bagosora was also taking a plane to Kinshasa for another mission of which I was unaware. 
Q.	Now, in Kinshasa were you able to make contacts that would enable you to meet someone in 
	South Africa that might be able to provide weapons? 
A.	Yes, when I got to Kinshasa there were people with whom we had been in contact and who were interested in those operations because there was a transport company.  And it is these people with whom we took the trip to South Africa.  I believe that among the documents that I kept carefully and which are in the possession of the Prosecutor, when I was in South Africa I signed two contracts, a transport contract with an airlines company, and a contract of delivery of goods or merchandise.  

So when I got to Kinshasa I was in contact with those concerned, and it is the same people who were based in Zaire but who also had contacts in South Africa who made it possible for me to obtain a visa into South Africa. 
Q.	Where in South Africa did you go? 
A.	I went to Johannesburg and then to Pretoria.  We established contacts and then I stayed there.  At one point in time Bagosora joined me there. 
Q.	When you went to South Africa were you successful in negotiating for the purchase of arms? 
A.	I got in contact with the people we were going to see, and they told us that it was possible for us to have weapons, taking into account the situation, but that it was necessary to have money on the spot, that they did not sell on credit and that they sold or they gave out the material on a cash basis.  And when I left I had no money.  

First of all, I went alone, because when I got to Kinshasa Lieutenant Colonel Ruhorahoza was kept by the ministry of defence himself -- minister of defence, who was there for some other reason.  And he said that Nzirorera had to leave alone, so I went on that mission alone.

And, as I said, I said to myself that I could also use the opportunity to buy some clothes.  I was in a very deplorable situation as far as clothing was concerned, and so were my children and so was my wife.  And since I was in South Africa, I did not have any money.  I had to send messages to Kinshasa to the ambassador to tell him that, "This is what is going on.  Please tell those who sent me here that there are possibilities but they need to pay." 
Q.	When you were negotiating in South Africa to buy the arms, did you tell them that you were representing the government of Rwanda against whom there was an arms embargo? 
A.	No.  At the time the situation was critical and you did not have to put out your identity in that fashion.  You had to be much more intelligent.  So when I got there, even though I had my Rwandan passport, it was possible for us to play the game and say that, "We are looking for weapons, but these weapons are not going to Rwanda.  They're intended for the Congo, for Zaire", because I was with Zaireans.  There you go.  

So I was there, Nzirorera, but not Nzirorera as national secretary of the MRND, even if that was what was written in the mission order, but Nzirorera as a Zairean officer somewhere, and I was in the company of Zaireans.  Those were the tricks that we could use to do what we could do.  We knew that the embargo had been decreased advisedly. 
Q.	And how much money was needed in South Africa to purchase the weapons and ammunition? 
A.	Initially, our supplier wanted to give us a consignment to the tune of $4 million.  So I transmitted the information to the ambassador in Kinshasa for him to forward it to the country.  He had all the offers.  And when Bagosora got to South Africa, because Jean Bosco had been held back, he was given 
	$1 million worth of travellers cheques.  So he took a plane back with a million dollars worth of 
	travellers cheques with all the risks that instilled.  

So when he got to South Africa, he got there on the 3rd of June, we went and saw our partners.  And the South African partner told us, "There you are.  All you have is $1 million.  So we're going to give you goods worth $1 million.  Nothing more, nothing less.  Given the situation, we cannot give you anything on credit." 
Q.	And then what happened after you were prepared to give the $1 million?  How were you going to get the weapons? 
A.	Yes, when we got there we held a brief meeting with our South African correspondents and the Zaireans who were involved in the transport.  And we -- our correspondent said that the weapons were available but that the weapons were not in South Africa, that they were in the Seychelles.  

And it was decided that we had to travel to the Seychelles, that it was necessary for someone to travel to the Seychelles.  But the correspondent was doing his business in South Africa.  He was a very respected person, a colonial white person.  And he told us that he could get into the Seychelles without any problem.  And he said that he was going to take one person who was a weapons expert to see the consignment.  

In fact from the -- on the Rwandan side there was myself, Bagosora, the Zairean and this gentleman, this South African.  And between Bagosora and I, we agreed that since he was the one who knew the type of weapons that they needed, it was up to him to go to the Seychelles.  So the gentleman took Bagosora with him and one of our Zairean compatriots.  

And I remained in South Africa with another Zairean.  And that gentleman, the white man, left a correspondent who was an accounting officer in his company who had to receive the money when the time came.  And he said that whenever he agreed with Bagosora on the quantity of weapons to be loaded, he was going to ask me to hand over the money, the money that was good enough for the consignment.  

So when Bagosora went to the Seychelles, we maintained telephone contact.  I was in South Africa, Bagosora was in the Seychelles.  And we had regular communication and I was waiting for him to tell me when I had to hand over the money in order to be sure that he had the consignment in his possession. 
Q.	And did there come a time when in fact he told you to go ahead and pay the money? 
A.	Yes.  He telephoned and told me that he had found the weapons, that they did not want to give us more, but that would be enough already for the amount of money we had.  And he told me that I could pay.  

But before paying, the transporter said that he had, first of all, to requisition his plane, so we had to sign a transport contract, which I signed I believe on the 4th of June.  And I agreed that the money would be paid on the 9th of June.  

And I believe you have all the supporting documents.  I kept them very carefully, and they're also in the possession of the Prosecutor. 
Q.	And what did you do after you paid the money on the 9th of June? 
A.	Yes, after I completed the operation my work was virtually accomplished and my visa had almost expired.  I had a day or two remaining.  So I confirmed my booking and I took the plane on the 
	9th of June from South Africa to Brazzaville. 
Q.	Now, when you returned to Brazzaville, where did you go from there? 
A.	I spent some time in Brazzaville, and on the same day I went to Kinshasa.  And when I got to Kinshasa I met the ambassador who told me that in the meantime Bagosora had sent messages because I had informed him that I had left.  And after paying I was told that in fact the people who had received the travellers cheques had said that they had realised that there was an opposition to those 
	travellers cheques.  So Bagosora sent out an SOS asking for assistance because he had the consignment, and it was necessary for him to leave the Seychelles conveniently too. 

So that was the problem.  It would appear that when the travellers cheques were brought it was not understood that some steps had already been taken regarding the embargo which had been decreed.  And there was also an embargo on the currency reserves that were in the Rwandan banks. 
Q.	So how did that problem get solved? 
A.	Yes, I was very surprised and I discussed with the ambassador, and I said:  "We needed to find a solution.  So how do we proceed?"  

And it turns out that coincidentally in Kinshasa the former governor of the national bank of Rwanda, or the governor because at the time he was, Daniel Ntirugirimbabazi -- I'm going to spell the name:  N-T-I-R-U-G-I-R-I-M-B-A-B-A-Z-I, Ntirugirimbabazi, first name Danny.  He was the governor of the national bank of Rwanda.  So we put that problem to him and he's the one who took the necessary steps with the final institutions and correspondents of the national bank of Rwanda to see how that problem could be solved, and he managed to solve that problem and get the suppliers paid.  

He himself said that those travellers cheques had been disqualified wrongly, that they had not been stolen, and that they had been clearly issued and regularly issued by the national bank of Rwanda, but that being the situation, they had other reserves which could make it possible for them to pay that million dollars and solve the situation.

It is -- that is how the governor sent money and credited the account of the various suppliers and Bagosora was able to get the plane to transport the consignment to Zaire in two trips. 
Q.	When you arrived back in Kinshasa, did you also have occasion to meet President Sindikubwabo? 
A.	Yes, I arrived in Kinshasa.  On the evening of the 9th of April I met President Sindikubwabo at the Intercontinental Hotel in Kinshasa.  He was leading an important delegation to the heads of state summit in Tunis.  

We were together at the Intercontinental Hotel that evening in Kinshasa at a dinner that was offered by the governor of Kinshasa, and during that dinner we discussed the situation.  He's the one, and it is only from then that I learnt that the government was no longer in Gitarama.  I found out about that on my return trip from South Africa in Kinshasa.  Upon meeting the members of that delegation, I was told that things had worsened and that the government had also left Gitarama. 
Q.	What did you think that the guns and ammunition that you were helping the Rwandan government to purchase would be used for? 
A.	Well, Mr. Nimy -- rather, Mr. Robinson, to prosecute a war you need arms and ammunitions.  I hope that you are not saying that these weapons were used to kill Tutsis because it seems to be that this is a prevailing opinion.  In fact the weapons were being used for fighting off the RPF which was virtually capturing the country. 
Q.	Can you tell us approximately when it was that you returned to Rwanda? 
A.	Yes, I spent some time in Kinshasa.  The presidential delegation having left on the 10th, I spent a few more days in Kinshasa, a few days.  And I left Kinshasa, arriving in Gisenyi on the 
	14th or the 15th of June, mid-June.  I returned to Gisenyi in mid-June. 
Q.	So effectively you were outside Rwanda from the 23rd of May to the 15th or 16th of June, correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	When you returned to Gisenyi, did you find the government there? 
A.	Yes, some members of government were still in Gisenyi and it was said that others were in Muramba, so the government was for all intents and purposes dispersed.  Some members were in Gisenyi, while others were in Muramba.  Muramba is spelt M-U-R-A-M-B-A, Muramba, an area in Gisenyi préfecture, some 80 kilometres or so from Gisenyi, that is, between Gitarama and Mukamira. 
Q.	Now, when you found that situation there, was there also plans being made for the transitional assembly, or the national assembly? 
A.	Yes, when I arrived there some decisions had been taken by the government.  I was informed of those decisions.  I was informed of what was to be done.  And that is how measures were taken to set up the national assembly and its bureau. 
Q.	And at that time did you decide to be a candidate for president of that national assembly? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did you have to campaign? 
A.	Yes, that position was not to be filled by nomination but by elections, so we needed to contact the voters. 
Q.	And how did you spend your time between the 16th of June and, let's say, the 22nd of June? 
A.	First of all, I would like to say that there were a series of actions or activities that had been undertaken when it was established that the RPF had rejected the ceasefire, even the ceasefire agreed to in Tunis at the heads of state summit.  Even that one was disregarded by the RPF.  So this raised many problems and the political parties were then requested to designate their members of parliament.  Previously, members of parliament were only from one party.  But the time came when the government decided that the members of parliament should come from various parties.  

Now, the decision was also taken that the parliament would be an interim parliament and that whenever the RPF decided to stop the war and accept the ceasefire and continue with negotiations for the setting up of the transitional institutions, then at that time the RPF would be able to occupy all its positions within the government and within parliament.

But I do not think that this was amenable to the RPF.  So the various political parties were asked to produce the lists of their various candidates to the positions of member of parliament and the said lists were forwarded to the government.  And those who wanted to run for positions in the bureau of the national assembly were to do so by way of a public announcement, and the results were published in early July. 
Q.	Now, on the 22nd of June 1994, did you return to Mukingo commune? 
A.	Yes, when I arrived in Gisenyi -- you know that my family was there.  I had left my family there.  And I noticed that there were very many people who had come to Gisenyi préfecture.  And Gisenyi, being a small city, was being filled up, so to speak, by people on a daily basis.  

At that time I was informed that people from Ruhengeri and Mukingo were in Gisenyi and were travelling to and from Mukingo commune from Nkuli towards Gisenyi.  That is how I learned that the swearing in of the new bourgmestre, Juvénal Kajelijeli, was going to take place and that people had been invited to that ceremony and that those who were able to attend should do so.  

Given that I was a native, or I am a native of Mukingo commune, and being present in Gisenyi, which was 35, 40 minutes away by car, so on the 27th I went to the swearing-in ceremony of 
Juvénal Kajelijeli.  I travelled with Mr. Laurent Semanza.  
Q.	And what was the date? 
A.	Rather, 22nd of June.  It was the 22nd of June 1994. 
Q.	Did you make a speech at the installation of Juvénal Kajelijeli? 
A.	Never. 
Q.	Did you notice some people marching in connection with that installation? 
A.	Well, yes, in fact during such ceremonies people who march or display one thing or another generally are trying to depict the prevailing situation.  That is exactly what happened with those youths who had wooden arms or symbols of weapons carrying as an indication that the country was at war.  

There was a march past by pupils from various primary schools and then we had that group of youths who also marched.  And the only comment that could be made about that march is that it was a reminder that the country was at war.  I was there.  The ceremony was chaired by the 
préfet of Ruhengeri, Mr. Basile Nsabumugisha.  Nsabumugisha is spelt N-S-A-B-U-M-U-G-I-S-H-A, Basile Nsabumugisha, who was the new préfet of Ruhengeri, having replaced Préfet Bariyanga who had died in Kigali with his family on the 7th of April. 
Q.	Prior to the 22nd of June 1994, had you heard of the Amahindure? 
A.	Well, frankly speaking, I did not know anything about the Amahindure.  I did not know anything about it.  But I learnt while I was here in this court that the movement had taken a broader dimension, but at that time I knew nothing about it. 
Q.	Now, did you have a relative by the name of Noel Ndayisabye? 
A.	Noel was a small boy.  He was the senior brother of Épimaque Nshizirungu.  Nshizirungu.  Maybe I should spell out that name:  Nshizirungu is R-S-H-I-Z-I-R-U-N-G-U (sic), Épimaque, who was the senior brother of Noel Ndayisabye.  N-D-A-Y-I-S-A-B-Y-E.  Ndayisabye.  Ndayisabye was the senior brother of Nshizirungu.  Both of them were the children of my junior brother.  Their father had died when they were still young.  So their mother left our family and found another husband for herself, leaving the children with my mother, who was their grandmother.

 THE WITNESS (continued):
On the 22nd of June 1994 when I attended that swearing-in ceremony, on my way back I went by my mother's residence to greet her, and then I found that she was very sad.  And she told me that Noel had been killed.  He had been shot by a soldier at the Byangabo centre opposite his father's shop.  Because his father owned a shop at the Byangabo centre where he sold some beer.  You know the main road that goes through Byangabo city.  That is how I learnt about the death of Noel.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Did anybody tell you that he had tried to rape some women on a bus? 
A.	No.  I found out about that here. 
Q.	Did you hear anything about that incident with the bus before you arrived here in Arusha? 
A.	No.  I also found out about that here. 
Q.	Did you stay overnight in Mukingo after the installation of Kajelijeli? 
A.	No.  I returned to Gisenyi. 
Q.	And after you went back to Gisenyi did you take some steps to relocate your family? 
A.	Yes.  My family was in Gisenyi.  But in the meantime I had to take a number of measures in view of the degrading situation.  So I decided to move them from Gisenyi to Kinshasa -- or at least plan to move them from Gisenyi to Kinshasa. 
Q.	Now, I meant to ask you when we were talking about Mukingo whether you had anything to do with the distribution of the land that had been owned by the Tutsis who had been killed.
A.	No, Mr. Robinson.  What could I have had to do with land in Mukingo commune?  I was not a figure of authority.  I didn't represent any authority in that area.  You see, sometimes we are given power and weight and influence that we do not have.  How can someone distribute land in a commune where there are authorities, where there is a préfet?  

So I think that in the documents disclosed to us by the Prosecutor there is a letter of the 24th of June from the préfet of Ruhengeri, Nsabumugisha, Basile, to all bourgmestres of 
Ruhengeri préfecture.  That letter was written in June, and it was very clearly stated therein by the préfet that the bourgmestres should note that the lands belonging to persons who were either killed or who had gone into exile or who were no longer in possession of their lands, that such lands should be managed by the respective communes which would then report accordingly in terms of the management and exploitation of that land.  This letter was written by Basile Nsabumugisha to all bourgmestres in his capacity as préfet of Ruhengeri.  

So I don't know whether I am being taken to have been the préfet of Ruhengeri.  I was never a 
préfet of Ruhengeri.  I never desired to hold that position.  I was never a bourgmestre.  I was never a conseiller.  So I do not understand this matter. 
Q.	Looking at document number 45 in the group of exhibits that we've presented, is that the letter that you're referring to? 
A.	Yes, the letter of the 21st of June 1994.  Yes, a letter to all the bourgmestres of Ruhengeri and signed by the préfet, Basile Nsabumugisha.  The letter is very clear. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would ask that that letter be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ804.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ804 admitted)
MR. WEBSTER:
We have no objection.  But if Mr. Robinson wouldn't mind, perhaps the witness could actually read it into the record so we have a complete translation.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, we can do that.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, this is a very short letter.  Can you please read it.
A.	Yes, I will do so.  

"Ruhengeri.  21 June 1994.  To the bourgmestres, all bourgmestres of Ruhengeri.  

"Dear bourgmestres:  Upon receiving this letter, I urge you to identify all pieces of land belonging to all persons who no longer live in the communes under your authorities, namely, those who may have been killed or who may have left the commune fleeing the war.  

"I also ask you to ask some members of the population who are attempting to illegally occupy these pieces of land to abstain from doing so illegally.  All the pieces of land which are no longer being occupied by their owners should be managed by the commune until subsequent directives are issued regarding the use to which such pieces of land should be put.  

"You are expected to submit to us a report on the management of those pieces of land at the end of each quarter.  

"Préfet of Ruhengeri, Basile Nsabumugisha.  

"Copied:  The minister of the interior and communal development and the sous-préfet of 
Busengo sub-préfecture."  

MR. WEBSTER:
Thanks to Mr. Robinson.  I just wanted to indicate I believe I heard the witness say the 24th of June as the date when he was testifying, but in reading the document we can all see that it indicates the 
21st of June.  So I just wanted to offer that clarification for the record.  
MR. ROBINSON:
That's correct.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Mr. Nzirorera -- 
THE WITNESS:
Well, I was speaking off the cuff, and I thought that it was the right date but I think I was mistaken.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, there were indications by Prosecution witnesses that fund-raising meetings took place in June of 1994.  Did you attend any such meetings? 
A.	Not at all.  I did not attend any fund-raising meeting for whatever purpose. 
Q.	Now, who won the election for president of the national assembly? 
A.	Well, I was elected.  I was a candidate while Mr.  Mbonampeka was also a candidate to that position.  At some point Mbonampeka chose not to compete against me, and while we were in the hall he decided to withdraw his candidature. 
Q.	And were you sworn in as president of the Rwanda national assembly? 
A.	Yes.  I was sworn in to that position during that time. 
Q.	How long did you remain in that position in Rwanda? 
A.	Not long.  Not long, because while we were still organising committee deliberations, you know what happened.  Things moved rather quickly, and on the 17th of July we left our country. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry.  If it's possible, could we have dates for these events, the swearing in and the election and so on and so forth.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	What date were you elected and what date were you sworn in? 
A.	Yes.  The elections took place on the 4th of July 1994, in Gisenyi préfecture at a place known as Kibihikane.  For security reasons we went to Kibihikane for that purpose.  K-I-B-I-H-I-K-A-N-E.  It's an area in Gicyiye commune -- Gicyiye is spelt G-I-C-Y-I-Y-E -- in Gisenyi préfecture.  The ceremony for security reasons took place at that area because Gisenyi was also under serious threat at the time. 
Q.	And you told us you left Rwanda 12 days later on the 17th of July; correct? 
A.	Yes.  Two weeks later, barely two weeks later, we left the country. 
Q.	Have you been back to Rwanda since? 
A.	Never. 
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, while you were secretary general of the MRND, hundreds of thousands of people died in Rwanda from the 6th of April 1994 until the 17th of July.  What is your responsibility for those events? 
A.	Please kindly repeat your question.  I did not quite understand the question. 
Q.	From the 6th of April 1994 until the 17th of July 1994, while you were the secretary general of the MRND, hundreds of thousands of people died in Rwanda.  And my question to you is:  What is your responsibility for those events? 
A.	First of all, I would like to say that I did not play any role in the killing of all those persons who perished in Rwanda.  This I can state categorically.  I did not play any role to bring anybody to their death.  That I am very clear on.  

Secondly, I think that I do not bear any responsibility for the situation which struck Rwanda from April to July 1994.  I say so because if anyone were to be responsible, it would not be Nzirorera.  

Three.  I tried to the best of my ability to make my contribution in my capacity as secretary general of the MRND party.  I did what I could to calm things down.  If I failed, it is not my fault.  If my colleagues failed too, it is not their fault either.  So, honestly speaking, I am innocent of the situation and the tragedy that struck our country and our people -- the tragedy that befell our country and our people. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, would you like to take our morning recess at this time?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We take our mid-morning recess for 15 minutes.
(Court was recessed from 1030H to 1055H)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, I now want you to talk about Mukingo commune.  Can you tell us first of all, where is Mukingo commune located? 
A.	Mukingo commune is one of the 16 communes of Ruhengeri, and it is located in the northwest of that préfecture and shares a border with the volcan area of Rwanda. 
Q.	When you're coming on the tarmac road from Kigali to Ruhengeri town and then Ruhengeri town to Gisenyi, where do you find Mukingo? 
A.	Mukingo commune is located between Ruhengeri and Gisenyi préfectures.  More specifically, when you leave Ruhengeri préfecture downtown, the communal office is about 13 kilometres from the headquarters of the Ruhengeri préfecture on the tarmac road. 
Q.	And as you're driving on the tarmac road from Ruhengeri towards Gisenyi, do you come to the commune office first before you reach Byangabo? 
A.	Yes.  Before you get to Byangabo you go through the Mukingo commune, which is 13 kilometres from Ruhengeri, and the commercial centre is 13 kilometres from Ruhengeri. 
Q.	How many kilometres is there between the commune office and Byangabo centre? 
A.	Two or so. 
Q.	And your mother's house, how far is your mother's house from the Byangabo centre? 
A.	At the centre of Byangabo.  I could call it a suburb of the central area but I will call it the centre of Byangabo.  It's very close to the Byangabo market near the Busogo primary school. 
Q.	And then if you continue on the Ruhengeri-Gisenyi road towards Gisenyi from Byangabo centre, how many kilometres is it to your residence? 
A.	Another 2 kilometres, or slightly more. 
Q.	And how far was your residence from the tarmac road? 
A.	If you're going towards Gisenyi, my residence was to the right of the tarmac road at a distance of 
200 to 300 metres. 
Q.	Now, you were born on 18th of April 1950 in Mukingo commune.  What's the name of your father? 
A.	My father's name was Bitihuse, B-I-T-I-H-U-S-E, Eliézer.  Eliézer Bitihuse. 
Q.	And what was his occupation when you were born? 
A.	When I got to the age of reason around 1956, I found that my father was a businessman.  He had a truck, or a lorry, and he was transporting Irish potatoes.  And he had also sort of transformed himself into a kind of entrepreneur because he was manufacturing bricks, tiles.  And with all that he also took up the construction of a number of buildings in the centre of Byangabo, and he subsequently resold these buildings.  So at the time he was a businessman. 
Q.	What's your mother's name? 
A.	My mother's name is Anastasie Nyiramakuba, N-Y-I-R-A-M-U-K-A-B-A (sic).  Her name was Nyiramakuba, and that was her name because both of them are dead. 
Q.	Were you her first child? 
A.	Yes, to my mother, yes, because my father was a polygamist, and I was the eldest to my mother. 
Q.	And how many brothers and sisters did you have from your mother's side? 
A.	Including myself?  There were four brothers and three sisters. 
Q.	And how many other children did your father have? 
A.	I have told you that my father was a polygamist.  And what I can say is that before the 1959 revolution he had the three wives -- or three or four legitimate wives.  And then later on he had other wives, other women.  He was a great man.  He made many children.  
Q.	So you had a very big family in Mukingo; correct? 
A.	Ours was a large family in Mukingo and in Nkuli.  But with the events that took place, not too many of them are still alive because, contrary to what has been said here, I really do not have any relatives in Nkuli and Mukingo communes.  But there was a time when we were a great family, a well-known family in the area.  My father was a very well-known man.  
Q.	And in 1990 through 1994 can you give us any estimate of the number of nephews you had running around Mukingo.  
A.	Nephews?  Well, I did not even know some of them, and I must be honest about that.  You see, there are nephews on my father's side, namely, children born to my father's sisters who got married elsewhere.  I do not know those people.  I could know my aunts, but I did not know all those other children.  

Secondly, we had nephews who were the children of my direct brothers or sisters, and those I could know because they lived with my mother.  Whenever their parents died, my mother would take them in.  But there were also nephews from my half-brothers, that is the other offspring of my father.  There were also many in number, and I did not know those ones.  

So it is difficult to answer your question and to tell you how many nephews I had.  You see, I even got to know some of them only after the Prosecutor had shown me their identification sheets.  Then I would know that they were my relatives.  You know, I could have run into them without knowing that they were my relatives.  So the question is a very difficult question to answer. 
Q.	Did you yourself attend primary school in Mukingo commune? 
A.	Yes.  I attended primary school in Mukingo commune. 
Q.	And where did you do your secondary school? 
A.	Upon passing the official exam, one of the parish priests in my area advised me to go to the seminary.  And he said he wanted me to go to the seminary, and he guided me to the -- towards the seminary.  I went to the minor seminary where I spent the first year, which is the preparatory year, as it was known at the time, in Byumba, and that is where I met Mr. Nahimana, Ferdinand.  

Then we went back to the Rwesero minor seminary -- R-W-E-S-E-R-O for Rwesero -- where I spent one year in what was referred to as sixieme latine at the time.  At the end of that year the bishop suggested that I should leave the seminary because I was being offered a special scholarship to study the humanities and sciences.  So I was transferred from the minor seminary in Rwesero to a school in Byumba, and I left my colleagues behind.  So I went to year three of the Byumba secondary school.  

At the end of that third year of secondary education I sat the official examination for the lower cycle of humanities and sciences, and I passed.  Then I moved to the Musanza college of humanities in Ruhengeri.  That is where I spent the next three years in the higher cycle of secondary education in Musanza.  And after those three years I obtained the certificate of humanities in June 1970.  
Q.	And during secondary school did you live at home or were you boarding at school? 
A.	Generally speaking, the schools -- secondary schools in Rwanda were boarding schools at the time, so we were all boarders and we only went home during the holidays. 
Q.	In what year did you graduate from primary school?  
A.	'64. 
Q.	After 1964 did you ever live permanently in Mukingo commune again? 
A.	No.  In 1964 -- well, while I was in primary school I was in the commune.  But when I moved to secondary school I was in boarding, and I only came back home for the Christmas holidays of about two weeks, for the Easter holidays for about two weeks, and then for the long holidays, as they were called at the time, that is from June to -- July, rather, to August.  And those were the only times I spent at home during the school year. 
Q.	When did you graduate secondary school? 
A.	As I said a short while ago, in June 1970. 
Q.	Did you attend university? 
A.	Yes.  Following my studies in the humanities, I wrote an examination for admission to the university, and I had -- I earned a scholarship to pursue university studies abroad.  But I don't know what happened, because I waited from June to November 1970 and did not receive a passport.  I was not issued a passport.  I then began to fear that I may not be able to pursue my studies for reasons that were unclear to me.  That is how I came to apply for admission at the national university of Rwanda. 
Q.	From what years did you attend that university? 
A.	I attended the national university of Rwanda from 1970 to October 1975.  First of all, I obtained a 
first-cycle diploma in mathematics and physics.  Then I also earned a diploma as engineer for 
	civil construction in October 1975.  So I was a civil engineer in 1975. 
Q.	Were you involved in politics in the university? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, did you participate at all in the changing of the first republic to the second republic when President Habyarimana took power? 
A.	That would not have been possible because I was still a student at the time. 
Q.	What did you do when you graduated with your diploma in civil engineering in 1975? 
A.	When I graduated, the rector of the university wrote to the ministry of national education requesting that I be transferred to the national university of Rwanda as an assistant lecturer and also as head of the civil engineering laboratory of the university.  So a presidential order was issued appointing me to that position in Butare.  So I went there.  And a few months later another presidential order transferred me to Kigali to the ministry of public works and equipment, as it was known at the time. 
Q.	And what post did you hold there when you first arrived? 
A.	When I arrived in Kigali, I was assigned to the ministry, and I was given the position of secretary of the administration, which was a rank that was given to all those who held academic diplomas at the 
second cycle of the university, so they were known as administration secretaries.  And one could grow from that level to a head of bureau and then progress on to other ranks.  
Q.	When were you first promoted? 
A.	I was at the ministry of public works and equipment, and then six months later, on the 
	30th of June 1976, to be specific -- or was it the 1st of July 1976 -- I was appointed general director of 
public works at the ministry of public works and equipment. 
Q.	And as general director, was there a particular section of the ministry of public works that you were in charge of? 
A.	Yes.  I was in charge of roads and bridges. 
Q.	And then when were you next promoted? 
A.	I held that position for five years.  And then in March 1981, to be specific, on the 29th of March, I was appointed minister of public works. 
Q.	How old were you when you were appointed minister? 
A.	I was about 31 years old.  I had just turned 31. 
Q.	Were you the youngest minister at the time? 
A.	I think I was among the youngest, because the youngest was 30 years old, and I entered government at the same time as Édouard Karemera.  I am slightly older than him, and he is younger than I.  So Ntagerura, André also joined government at the same time, and he is my age mate.  So about six of us, six new ministers, were appointed on the 29th of March 1981 into government. 
Q.	After your appointment as minister of public works, did that ministry expand, and was it given other titles and responsibilities? 
A.	Well, the ministry of public works at the time was experiencing some transformations.  It had to handle public works equipment, as it was initially known, public works and equipment.  Then it became public works, energy and water, and in that context it had to deal with all manner of infrastructure.  And at some point the ministry was even in charge of service and urban planning.  So it was increasingly a ministry that ended up with four major departments, whereas initially it had only two. 
Q.	And how long did you serve as minister of public works? 
A.	I was minister for public works from the 29th of March 1981 till the 9th of July 1990, nine to ten years in that position. 
Q.	Can you describe for the Chamber what was your relationship with President Habyarimana over those years.  
A.	My relationship with President Habyarimana was based on service by the minister to the president, the minister who reports to the president at the beginning of each legislative period.  The president assigns specific duties and tasks to each ministry, and it is the prime responsibility of the minister to ensure that those objectives are met.  So the relationship was one of president and minister, one of service. 
Q.	Did you have any personal relationship with him as well?  Were you friends? 
A.	Friends as such, it's very difficult to say you're the head of state's friend.  You must be careful.  In politics there are many criteria that the president or the head of state uses to choose his collaborators, so you cannot just say that you are a friend to the head of state.  No.  Our relations were limited to service reasons, so I did not have any special affinities with President Habyarimana. 
Q.	Were you also a member of parliament? 
A.	Yes.  I was elected a member of parliament first time in January 1982.  I was elected to represent the Ruhengeri constituency. 
Q.	And were there other times when you were re-elected? 
A.	The first -- my first term was shortened to align it with the term of office of the president of the republic.  So it was only two years long, 1982-1983.  At the end of 1983 there were fresh elections, and I was re-elected to the parliament which was called the conseil national de développement, 
national council for development, and the term of office was five years.  We had elections again in
December 1998 -- 1988, and I was once again re-elected. 
Q.	Now, we know that in Rwanda prior to 1991 the MRND was the unique party.  Did you hold any posts within the MRND party during that period? 
A.	During the single-party system it was possible to hold two positions, so there were people who held offices of minister and member of parliament and also member of the central committee.  Subsequently, in the month of May-June 1986, I was appointed as a member of the MRND central committee, 
MRND mouvement révolutionnaire national pour le développement, the former single party. 
Q.	Now, during the period while you were minister of public works, did you also maintain investments and other business activities? 
A.	Yes.  Once one became a minister, one had to organise oneself.  You could carry out your own activities privately while carrying out the official duties.  And at the time we were appointed, my wife, who was also an employee in the centre administration -- President Habyarimana had decided that it was not normal for ministers' spouses to continue to work within the centre administration.  So when my wife was relieved of her duties in centre administration, we tried to organise ourselves so that she should take care of family business. 
Q.	And what kind of investments and businesses did you and your wife have? 
A.	My wife was working in a commercial enterprise where fuel was sold along with spare parts. 
Q.	Did you acquire any property? 
A.	Yes, a few. 
Q.	And did you operate any lorries? 
A.	Yes.  We had lorries which were used to transport fuel.  You know Rwanda is not -- is a landlocked country, so we had to get these products from Dar es Salaam.  So we had to use tankers.  We had a number of them.  We also had keepers that could be used for building purposes, whether you're talking about building roads or houses, and very often we resorted to these when we had contracts, and I used them during the weekends to build my own places.  I am capable of designing a house and building one.  So I had everything I needed to do so. 
Q.	And by 1990 how would you describe your economic situation? Were you wealthy? 
A.	What year are you referring to?
Q.	1990.
A.	You know, being rich is relative.  So I can say that I was not poor, but I can also say that I was not very rich.  So it all depends on the observer.  When does one become rich?  Can somebody say you are rich?  I'm sure you would say no.  But I wouldn't say I was poor.  
Q.	Did you derive any income from corruption? 
A.	With the advent of multiparty politics in Rwanda, there was a proliferation of newspapers, newspapers which published all sorts of things, anything they wanted.  But I think that it's what democracy is all about.  They wrote.  They attacked me.  I was not the only one.  There were others.  There were people who were targeted, and I was one of those targets.  President Habyarimana was targeted.  There were other people who were targeted.  

At one point in time I was fed up.  I saw cartoons and I took the matter to court, because I had a house that I had just built, and the Isibo newspaper attacked me cheaply and said that I had used public funds without having any proof.  They did not know that I had obtained a loan to construct that building.  So I took the matter to court, and the owner and the editor in chief of the opposition newspaper Isibo, his name was Musangamfura -- I'll spell that.  Sixbert, M-U-S-A-N-G-A-M-F-U-R-A -- Sixbert.  He was the proprietor and editor in chief of the MDR opposition newspaper Isibo.  

I took the matter to court, and I won the case at the trial phase and at the appeal phase.  And it was shown that in fact the house he was referring to had been financed by the bank, and he was spreading information which was not correct.  So during that period of multiparty politics there were excesses and people let off steam, and that was the case.  
Q.	Did you employ Tutsis in the ministry of public works? 
A.	In the ministry of public works there were Tutsis, many of them, because, first of all, for awhile that ministry was led or was under a Tutsi minister whose name was André Katabawa, K-A-T-A-B-A-W-A.  It is this minister who -- when I was employed he was the minister, and there were Tutsis in that ministry.  And when I got there nobody was victimised because I came to the head of the ministry.  Quite on the contrary, others were promoted.  So there were Tutsis in the ministry.

1145H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And did the ministry do business with businessmen who were Tutsis?  
A.	Yes.  I believe that that is, perhaps, one of the ministries that gave the largest number of contracts to Tutsis.  I know -- I am sure you know all the building enterprises in Rwanda.  The majority of those enterprises were owned by Tutsis.  If you know Kacyiru, where the ministries are, you'll see that the ministerial buildings which are there, which were built or constructed by the second republic or under the second republic -- the files are there, you can see them -- they were all built or constructed by Tutsis or by Tutsi companies or enterprises.  So my answer is yes.  
Q.	And did you yourself have anything against Tutsis? 
A.	Nothing.  Nothing at all.  On the contrary, I'm sure when you went to Kigali you met a major 
Tutsi businessman who is called Rubangura, R-U-B-A-N-G-U-R-U -- U-R-A., and that he must have told you that I could be accused -- I could be accused of anything, but not of any -- not of hatred against the Tutsis.  I believe that's the answer he gave you.  

Because he himself recognises that if he could build all those houses -- he had major enterprises.  He had -- he had access to water and electricity to supply his businesses.  He had access to land.  And surveys were -- was under me.  And he told you that, if I had something against Tutsis, he would not have had all that land and all the infrastructure.  
Q.	Now, prior to 1990, was there people who were refugees in Uganda who wanted to return to the country? 
A.	Yes.  The problem of Rwandan Tutsi refugees dates back to the 1959 revolution.  When the revolution took place, there were a number of Tutsis who went into exile.  And so that problem dates back to the 1959 revolution.  
Q.	And what efforts were made to find a solution to that problem? 
A.	In fact, after 1959, the -- both the provisional government, or the provisional government of the 
first republic -- both made efforts to repatriate the Tutsis who had left Rwanda.  And so during the provisional government from 1960 to 1961, there was a ministry in charge of refugees.  

When the UA -- UNAR -- refugees -- Tutsi refugees -- a wing of Tutsis who never recognised that revolution and who did not want to recognise the republic went in exile and set up a terrorist movement called Inyenzi to attack the country and take over power by force.  The Inyenzi attack went on from 1961 right through to 1967.  

And throughout that period of the first republic, President Grégoire Kayibanda -- Kayibanda is spelt K-A-B-A -- 

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness -- the witness is mistaken with the spelling of Kayibanda. 
THE WITNESS:
-- continued sending messages to refugees requesting them to return to the country peacefully and take part in the democratic reform and reconstruction of the country.  I remember very well that, in that first republic government, there were two or three ministerial portfolios that were given to Tutsis, but his call or appeal was not heeded.  

President Kayibanda did that in 1963, 1964, 1966.  He signed decrees facilitating the repatriation of these people.  A number of them accepted, but others refused.  So that is what the first republic did.  

Talking about the provisional government, there was a ministry in charge of refugees.  And then as far as the first republic is concerned, President Kayibanda made appeals.  And in the second republic, President Habyarimana himself took this phenomenon to heart and he took his first measures as -- following his accession to power in 1974, when he got Rwanda and Uganda to set up a 
mixed commission which had to be responsible for refugees, among other things.  This was in 1974.  

But at the time Uganda was under a prominent dictator.  And following the political and economic situation of the time, it was not possible for that commission to function.  It was only subsequently, when President Museveni acceded to power, that the commission was reconstituted in 1978 -- '78, the inter-ministerial Rwanda-Uganda committee.  

And on the 15th of January 1989, during his platform speech, the president talked about the problem of refugees.  But also, one month later in February, he set up what he referred to as the special commission responsible for studying the problems of Rwandan immigrants living elsewhere and in Rwanda.  And it is that special commission which had to work through the joint Rwanda-Uganda ministerial committee to cater for the problems of refugees who were living in Uganda and elsewhere.  

That committee met for the first time in February 1989, the second time in November 1989.  
The first meeting took place in Kigali.  The second one took place in Uganda.  And the third time, the commission met in Kigali from the 27th to the 30th of July 1990.  

In fact, when the RPF attacked on the 1st of October 1990, the problem of the repatriation of refugees was being solved, but the pretext which the RPF had given was that it wanted the Tutsi refugees to be repatriated and they wanted democracy to rule -- to be the rule in Rwanda.  

We realised that that was the -- a false pretext because they used that commission to attack on the 
1st of October; whereas, that meeting of 1990 had been attended by representatives of the UNHCR and OAU who had decided that they had to come to Rwanda in September to identify the sites and places where people could set up.  

So the RPF went to war.  And one of the conclusions of that meeting, which was very important, was that there would be a tripartite meeting in January 1991 to assess the results.  But in the meantime, the RPF undermined all the negotiations that had been -- begun.  I'm trying to summarise, but that is what happened briefly.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	In addition to taking steps to solve the problem of the refugees in Uganda who wanted to return, did President Habyarimana also take steps before the attack of October 1990 to implement greater political space in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes.  As from 1986, President Habyarimana had felt the need for the necessary reforms in the country and he -- to this effect, he met the civil servants in the central administration, the business community, civil society.  And during activities commemorating the 25th anniversary of independence on the 
1st of July 1987, President Habyarimana talked about that concern and said that he had tried to use his speech of the 15th of January 1989, in what he called the political aggiornamento, to say that the country needed reforms.  

There were challenges that he had to take up in governing the country.  President Habyarimana 
on the 5th of July 1990, shortly after the Franco-African summit which took place on the 
19th to the 20th of June 1990 at La Baule -- President Mitterrand had clearly explained to 
African...(no interpretation)...that France's assistance to African countries henceforth would be tied to the democratisation process in those countries.  

In fact, this was all in the context of the end to -- of the cold war with the collapse of the eastern bloc.  Africans might, perhaps, not see it in that light.  But everybody was of the opinion that the wind which was blowing in Eastern Europe was not going to leave out African countries. 

And as a good student, President Habyarimana, on the 5th of July 1990 during the speech which he delivered on the occasion of the 28th anniversary of independence, he announced the advent of multiparty politics and stated that he was going to set up an organ to prepare a national charter and people had to make -- provide ideas on the governance of the country.  

And faithful to his promise, President Habyarimana on the 24th of September 1990 set up the 
	national commission, which was entrusted with the duty of preparing this national charter.  

And the deliberations of that committee were -- were chaired by Mr. Édouard Karemera -- Karemera, who is present here, and I think he'll have the opportunity to tell you how things developed and how the situation in the country was taken into consideration.  

And in the meantime, the RPF attacked on the 1st of October 1990.  
Q.	Taking a look at exhibit number 1 in our packet of exhibits.  Was that the decree which set up the commission of national synthesis on the 24th of September 1990? 
A.	Yes.  That is the presidential decision -- or decree of 24th September 1990 creating the national harmonisation commission. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I ask that that be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ805. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ805 admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Can you tell us where you were on the 1st of October 1990 when the RPF attacked Rwanda?  
A.	On the 1st of October 1990, I was not in Rwanda.  The president had sent me on mission, and I was the bearer of a message from the president to the president of Cyprus.  I was, therefore, in Cyprus on mission to deliver the president's message to his counterpart in Cyprus.  
Q.	And where was President Habyarimana on the 1st of October 1990? 
A.	President Habyarimana was at the children's summit at the United Nations in New York.  
Q.	Did you meet President Habyarimana before his return to Rwanda? 
A.	I left the airport in Cyprus on the 2nd and travelled to Paris.  When I arrived in Paris in the afternoon, the ambassador informed me that President Habyarimana was on his way back from New York, and he told me that we could wait for him.  So the president arrived a few minutes later, and I did meet him indeed in Paris.  
Q.	And did you return to -- when did you return to Rwanda? 
A.	We had a discussion with the president and his delegation that evening.  The delegation was made up of, among others, the minister of foreign affairs who, at the time, was Casimir Bizimungu; the 
minister of planning, Augustin Ngirabatware, and myself on my return trip from Cyprus.  

The president decided, in view of the prevailing situation in Rwanda, to make some diplomatic contacts in France and in Belgium.  So he asked the delegation to return home while we -- in fact, the entire delegation, which had travelled with the president to New York and myself, we took the plane on the evening of the 4th of October 1990 to return to Kigali while the president remained in Paris with -- to follow up the contacts with President Mitterrand and then to meet Wilfried Martens, the prime minister of Belgium, and King Baudouin.  
So we travelled back.  And when we arrived in Nairobi via an Air France flight -- Air France flight which was supposed to take us to Kigali, but was diverted to land in Nairobi because we were told that it was not possible to land in Kigali because the war was raging in the capital and the capital had been captured.  So our flight was diverted to Nairobi -- or, rather, to Bujumbura, and we remained in Bujumbura, having landed there in the morning of the 5th in Bujumbura.  
Q.	And when did you get back into Rwanda? 
A.	On the 7th of October.
Q.	When did President Habyarimana return to Rwanda? 
A.	When we arrived, we were told that the president had arrived on his private jet.  From the United States he had travelled on the Concorde, but his Falcon was in Belgium and in Paris, and that was the jet he travelled with.  But before we got to Kigali, he had already arrived in Kigali.  
Q.	We have in evidence the speech of President Habyarimana on the 15th of October 1990, which is D. NG8 -- or D. NG6 which indicates that President Habyarimana encouraged the population to be calm and not to take actions against members of ethnic groups.  Did you agree with that position? 
A.	Yes, fully.  I agreed fully with President Habyarimana's position because, in such circumstances, old demons are often awakened, and what the president wanted to do was to stop the country from dipping into inter-ethnic confrontations.  So I believe that the type of speech he made was coherent and consistent in all his public statements.  Because he knew that if nothing was done, things could degenerate.  

President Habyarimana was a charismatic leader who was more or less listened to by Rwandans.  
Q.	Was there a summit to try to resolve this conflict held in Mwanza on the 17th of October 1990? 
A.	Well, when the president arrived in Rwanda, and upon receiving all the information -- or having been briefed, he noticed that the RPF had, indeed, outsmarted all government initiatives relating to the repatriation of the refugees and the democratisation of the country.  They had boycotted every aspect of those transactions.  

So following the contacts he had in Paris and Brussels, he came to the conclusion that he could not just fold his hands and sit there.  So during the month of October 1990, he went on to establish more contacts at the political and diplomatic levels.  

After his speech of the 15th, he travelled to Kenya and met President Arap Moi.  And the 
prime minister -- the Belgian prime minister, Wilfried Martens, had been invited to that meeting at which they were expected to survey ways and means to achieving a peaceful settlement to the conflict that had just arisen.  

It is within that context that, from the 17th of October, President Habyarimana travelled extensively, going to the Mwanza summit, going to the Gbadolite summit, going to the Dar es Salaam summit, going to the Zanzibar summit, even to the Goma summit, and he didn't rest at all.  

Throughout all those summits and those meetings with heads of state of the region, the main question was how to seek a peaceful resolution to the conflict that had just erupted.  That was the primary focus.  And the issue was also to find out how to solve the problem which appeared to be the basis of the RPF claims; namely, the repatriation of refugees and the democratisation process.  

It is within that context, therefore, that if you look at the communiqués that were issued at that time, there was consistent measure -- mention of ceasefire and peaceful resolution of the conflict as well as the settlement of the refugee problem, not through the various commissions that had been set up but which had been foiled by the RPF, but through what the heads of state referred to as the regional conference of the countries of the region.  

These are the matters that were addressed in the various communiqués released at the 
Mwanza summit in October, the Goma, the Gbadolite, the Dar es Salaam and other summits that took place at that time.  

So that was, in the main, the content of those communiqués, as efforts were being sought to address all the claims raised by the RPF.  But on each and all of those circumstances, facilitators were designated, and Museveni was even asked to be involved in explaining to those people who had come from his country that it was necessary for them to drop this war option.  
Q.	Directing your attention to exhibit number 3 in our packet, is that the communiqué that was issued at the conclusion of the Mwanza summit on the 17th of October 1990?  Do you have that 
document number 3? 
A.	Yes, I have it.  
Q.	Is that the communiqué that was issued in Mwanza at the conclusion of the summit on the 17th of October 1990? 
A.	Yes.  It is, indeed, the Mwanza summit.  Mwanza is in Tanzania.  It brought together heads of state, Museveni, Habyarimana.  And you can see under paragraph 2, the decisions and recommendations of that summit.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would ask that that document be admitted D. NZ806.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ806 admitted)

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, directing your attention to document number 4 in our packet of materials, is that the communiqué that was issued at the conclusion of the summit in Gbadolite in Zaire on the 26th of October 1990? 
A.	Yes.  I can confirm that it is the communiqué issued at the end of the summit of heads of state in Gbadolite in Zaire on the 26th of October 1990.  I would like to draw your attention to item number 4 dealing with the issue of refugees.  
Q.	Can you read number 4.  
A.	Yes.  

	"With respect to the question of refugees, the heads of state once again reaffirm that the dialogue should culminate in a regional conference to find a final and lasting solution to the question of refugees.  

"The presidents of Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi express their deep appreciation to President Mobutu and the people of Zaire for their warm welcome accorded to them and their delegation."
Q.	Thank you.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would ask that this document be admitted as D. NZ807. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ807 admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, looking at item 6 in our packet of exhibits, is that the communiqué that was issued at the conclusion of the summit in Goma on the 30th of November 1990? 
A.	Yes.  It's not the 29th of November, it is the 20th of November 1990.  Yes, that is indeed the communiqué following the summit of heads of state in Goma.  And I would like to draw your attention to the findings at items number 1, 2 and 3 as recorded in the communiqué.  
Q.	Okay.  Can you summarise those for us.  
A.	Briefly, the summit recommended that a ceasefire be put in place and that a military -- a group of military observers be set up.  The summit also conferred on President Mobutu the role of mediator.  And the summit, once again, insisted on the need for the parties to commit themselves to find a final and lasting solution to the refugee problem, and it sought to involve the OAU in that quest for a solution.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, may that be admitted as D. NZ808.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ808 admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, by the end of April 19 -- excuse me.  By the end of October 1990, what was the situation of the war? 
A.	Around the 30th of October, following intense fighting, the RPF and its troops were kicked out of Rwanda.  The Rwandan government believed that those people could not chase them as far as Uganda for fear of creating other problems.  So they continued to look for ways and means of solving pending problems, including the problem of the refugees and the democratisation.  

So the Rwandan government declared that they had chased off the troops from Uganda, but others infiltrated the Kagera Park.  And some of them had also found refuge while others returned to 
Rwanda -- to Uganda, rather.
Q.	Now, I'd like you to take a look at document number 7 in our packet of exhibits.  It's a book or pamphlet entitled, Livre Blanc.  Can you tell us what this is. 
A.	This document is a document that was authored by the Rwandan ministry of foreign affairs and cooperation.  The purpose of the document was to inform the public and the international community of the reality surrounding the war that had been initiated by the RPF on 1 October 1990.  

The document portrays the situation in which the RPF had given some pretexts as to the reasons for its attack.  And those pretexts were analysed, and it was found that the claims or pretexts were false because the RPF was actually driven by a hidden agenda.  

So those are the simple words in which I can summarise this document which, in its various chapters, indicates that the RPF, though it claimed to be a movement of refugees, had a number of Ugandans supporting it.  And then goes on to state that the pretext put forward by the RPF was not its true agenda.  

The document, however, also goes to state the efforts that were made by the Rwandan government which stretched its hand out towards those attackers and aggressors, but that gesture was turned down.  

The document concludes that there were also undisclosed objectives that the RPF was pursuing, but which it did not disclose, although it put forward an attractive political programme.  

I cannot go into the details of this book.  But you would find in it pictures of persons who were captured bearing Ugandan uniforms and identity cards.  You will see photographs of vehicles with Ugandan registration plates, and you will see evidence to the contrary of any assertions that the RPF was never assisted by the Ugandan government.  
So those, in broad strokes, are what can be said to be the content of the document which depicts the situation and also outlines the achievements of the second republic and the years of stability from 
1976 to 1990 to the credit of the government.  So that is a summary of the book as I can best offer.  
Q.	Thank you.  And this is dated the 15th of January 1991; correct? 
A.	Yes.  It is a document of the 15th of January 1991.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'd ask that this be admitted as D. NZ809.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ809 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Mr. Nzirorera, if we could just look at page 27 of this document briefly.  Does it set forth the RPF programme? 
A.	Yes, it does.  If you turn to page 27, you will see what is referred to as the purported political programme of the RPF, which starts with the claim that the aggression -- the armed aggression of Rwanda was tak -- was initiated under the pretext of trying to solve the refugee problems of Rwandans which had been neglected by the Rwandan government.  So this is the purported programme of the RPF.  

But curiously, the issue of the refugees does not figure as point number 1 but, rather, as point number 5.  
Q.	Now, turning to page 33, is there reference to the use of force by the RPF to accomplish its programme? 
A.	Yes.  I can read that the undisclosed truth behind the political programme brandished by the Inkotanyi to the international community was -- or is visible in the articles of Inzira Isigaye; namely, the last alternative or Igihugu Cyangwa Urupfu, which means the country -- or death -- or in some other Kinyarwanda expression which means:  Let us stop making noise for nothing.  And all of these things are mentioned here, and reference is made to the papers in which the RPF actually disclosed the true nature of its objectives in newspapers, such as, Impuruza, Inkotanyi and so on and so forth.  

If you were to turn to page 35, you would see that one of the authors of the article who does not believe in the negotiations, peaceful negotiations with the government of Rwanda for the settlement of the problem of Rwandan refugees, leaves room only for the last alternative, which is recourse to force in order to come to a point where power is shared.  
Q.	Now, we've also heard evidence of the Hutu Ten Commandments.  Does this document also refer to -- or indicate that there were some Tutsi commandments as well? 
A.	Yes.  In fact, when Mr. Hassan Ngeze came here to testify and the Prosecutor confronted him with the problem of the infamous ten commandments, he talked about the commandments of the Tutsis.  
Those commandments are not entirely listed in this document, but there is another document which contains all of the commandments in extenso.  

In fact, there were 19 principles which have been summarised here:  Hasn't it been discovered with stupefaction in Kigali that the Inkotanyi had registered on the arms of young men and on the breasts of young women Harakabaho Kigeli wa V, which means long live Harakabaho Kigeli the 5th.  Or the abbreviation TIP, which means Tutsi -- or standing for Tutsi International Power.  

The plan to involve Tutsi International Power, TIP, is not a matter of today, as can be seen from a document entitled, "The plan for Tutsi colonisation in Kivu and in the Central Africa region".  And this is an excerpt from a letter which was discovered in Nyamitaba -- N-Y-A-M-I-T-A-B-A for Nyamitaba -- in the north of Kivu on the 6th of August 1962 -- 1962.  

The author of this letter was telling his people about the 19 principles or pieces of advice that all Tutsis from all regions whatsoever are bound to implement and which should be disseminated as broadly as possible for -- to Tutsis of the district of the volcanoes.  

Among these 19 principles, we shall take seven to demonstrate the point.  Well, I will not read all the seven principles, but let me simply refer to the 13th commandment on page 38.  

"You must know that a Hutu is created to be a servant and shall never hold any position of responsibility."  

Principle number 16.  "We call on all Tutsi youth because even if we do not succeed in spite of our finesse, we shall resort to violence." 

So we can also mention that there is a book which contains all the 19 principles which can be brought to the court as need be.  
Q.	And did the RPF resort to violence again on the 22nd and the 23rd of January 1991 by attacking the town of Ruhengeri? 
A.	What can be said is that, during that period of war, there was recourse to force and violence in order to create chaos.  We believe that all of those things fall within the context of a very specific programme which was not dissimulated.  It was not hidden.  

You may already know that the RPF strategy paper, which was published towards the end of 1993, early 1994, which is an exhibit before this Tribunal -- in evidence, rather, before this Tribunal, does clearly show under point 4 what the RPF plan was all about.  

If we look carefully at what finally transpired, including the elimination of President Habyarimana, according to that provision whereby it is stated that -- in any event, the RPF should have 
a striking force, even if the transitional institutions were set up so that it may be able to eliminate President Habyarimana within a time frame not to exceed nine months from the signing of the Arusha Accords.  

Now, if we were to read that provision carefully and to see things in their proper dimension, between the 4th of August and the 6th of April, we are dealing with a period of some eight to nine months.  So there might be people who are much more organised, but they are not being scrutinised.  

So if one were to talk about a plan, there might have been a need to look carefully at that document and see who was planning what.  But unfortunately, nobody wants to talk about it.  Nobody wants to look at it. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, would you like to take our luncheon adjournment at this time?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We take our luncheon adjournment now.

(Court resumed at 1422H) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Good afternoon, everyone. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Nzirorera.  
A.	Good afternoon, Mr. Robinson. 
Q.	We've had evidence that on the night of 20 to 23 January 1991 the RPF attacked Ruhengeri.  Where were you when that happened? 
A.	In January 1991 during the Ruhengeri attack, I was in Kigali. 
Q.	Now, you were in Kigali from the time that you graduated university and got your first employment with the ministry of public works.  And how often in that period before the war -- let's say, from 1980 when you became minister of public works until October 1990, how often would you go to Mukingo during that period? 
A.	The period of October?  Can you please specify the period. 
Q.	I'm speaking of the period from 1980 when you became the minister of public works until October 1990 when the RPF launched the war.  Those ten years, how frequently did you go to Mukingo? 
A.	The frequency?  You want to know how many times I went to Mukingo over a period of ten years, or are you talking of the monthly, the weekly, the yearly frequency?  Perhaps you could help me to understand the question better. 
Q.	In general, how often did you go?  Not the total number of times but an -- approximately how many times a month or how many times a year did you go? 
A.	I will try to give you the context in which I went to Mukingo, my area.  And from what I will tell you, we will try to deduce the frequency.  From 1981 to 1990 I must say that -- between 1981 and 1985 my trips to my commune, my native commune, were few.  I went there on very few occasions, except in exceptional circumstances, especially during elections; secondly, during préfectoral meetings; thirdly, during certain projects the -- during what was called a quinzaine des projets.  

And from the month of July, the government would set aside two weeks to tour the whole country in order to launch or inaugurate development projects or for private activities, for example, social private activities like marriages, deaths.  So I would say that it was only in such circumstances when I was really compelled to travel that I travelled to be with members of my family.  

Those trips up to 1985, in any case, were limited.  They were limited because the road from Kigali to Ruhengeri was in a very poor state.  It was not yet tarred.  Therefore, the only time I could travel would be over the weekend.  I would go and return over the weekend.  And until 1986 my trips were limited to specific events such as those I just mentioned.  To be brief, from 1986 we completed the grating and the tarring of the Kigali-Ruhengeri road.  
After that period I initiated a programme, a programme for the development of the region.  The programme comprised, in particular, the putting in place of a parent association for the promotion of education in Busogo.  It is within that association of which I was a sponsor that we were -- we set up or created the school called ESTB, the school of science and -- the technical and science school of Busogo.  

But the association did not only target schools.  It also targeted other activities, social, cultural activities.  In other words, we were -- we were not only thinking of the creation of that school in order that some children could be admitted in secondary school but we also thought of a literary programme.  We thought about showing films for the cultural and intellectual emancipation of the people of the area.  

It was, therefore, on that occasion that I could easily -- at the time that I could ease -- move easily on the road -- from 1986 I was able to bring together the natives of that area.  I brought them from Kigali and also those who were elsewhere so that altogether we could divert ourselves to the development of that region.  I did so not only as a minister but also as a member of parliament of the area, a member of parliament in whom the population put its trust.  

Now, since my government activities did not allow me to travel during the week and also because on Saturday -- or the day of Saturday was either used for office work or community development work.  Whenever I had the possibility, I would travel.  Generally, that would be in the afternoon of Saturday.  And I would convene meetings to bring together the founding members of the organisation or association in order to create schools.  We had to draw up statutes for those schools.  In general, such meetings were held on Sundays when we were able to bring together people.  And the meetings were held at the seat of the school in the Busogo parish.  Busogo, B-U-S-O-G-O.  So it was near that parish that we started the construction work for that school.  

Therefore, between 1986 and 1990 my visits to Mukingo commune, in addition to visits I made for social events -- I could also make myself available to chair the meetings of the parents association in order to start the construction work and ensure follow-up of the construction work and thus enable the school to open.  And this was necessary until we had a complete secondary school.  In fact, we -- beginning with the first year, we had six years of secondary school.  

So up to 1990 I would say that my visits to Mukingo commune were more frequent, especially during weekends, during Sunday meetings.  And it was always necessary for me to return to Kigali on Sunday since from Monday I had to go back to my state responsibilities.  I was not always in Mukingo over the weekends.  I had other activities in Kigali.  In general, over the weekend I would also take care of my personal business after my official business.  So to summarise, if you want to know how frequently I went there, I would say that I -- it -- I went there more regularly between 1986 and 1990. 
Q.	When did the ESTB school open? 
A.	In 1987. 
Q.	We have the statutes of that parents association in evidence, and it was discussed by Juvénal Kajelijeli, who was also involved in that association.  Can you tell us what was your relationship with Juvénal Kajelijeli.  
A.	In fact, when the association was set up, people were well aware that I was the person behind that association, and they, therefore, requested that I should be the president and the legal representative of the association.  And we also set up a committee with a vice-president, a secretary, a treasurer.  

And the treasurer at the time was the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune.  The bourgmestre of Mukingo commune at that time in 1987 was not Kajelijeli.  It was a certain Alphonse Bahembera.  Bahembera is spelt B-A-H-E-M-B-E-R-A.  

He was the bourgmestre and at the same time the treasurer of the school -- or, rather, the treasurer of the association because the -- a clear distinction should be made between two things, the 
non-profit making association for the social and cultural promotion of the area; and among our activities we set up a school.  But we did not limit our activities to that.  As I said, we also intended to set up a 
cultural centre for cultural activities, a projection of cinemas, cinema films, and so on.  So the bourgmestre was the treasurer of the association.  And I was the president of the association. 

So when the school was opened, we set up the management of the school, which we left in the hands of the congregation of Josephite Brothers of Kabgayi.  It is there that through the superior general of that congregation we got three Josephite Brothers who were in Kabgayi and who came and ran that school.  One was the school principal.  The other one was the bursar, and the other one was in charge of studies.  And the three Josephite Brothers were of Tutsi ethnic origin.  

They came, and when they came, we also built a convent for those three brothers.  So the school was run by these three brothers.  And at the level of organisation, we had an account of the association.  And we opened another account, an account for the school which was opened by -- which was, rather, run by those three brothers.  But when necessary, we went down for the teachers and these brothers to tell us what difficulties they were facing on the spot. 

Now, talking about Kajelijeli, although he was a member of the association, in fact, one of the founding members of the association, at the time he was not doing anything.  He came later on when he replaced Bahembera as bourgmestre, because Bahembera left the position of bourgmestre and was transferred to another service out of Mukingo commune.  And that is when Kajelijeli became the treasurer of the association, not the treasurer of the school because there are some people who are confused and they think that Kajelijeli was the treasurer of the school.  The school had its bursar, who was one of the brothers.  So that is what the situation was. 

And the school was running normally.  We had about 20 or so teaching staff. 
Q.	And what was your relationship with Juvénal Kajelijeli? 
A.	I knew Kajelijeli from childhood.  First of all, he hails from Mukingo commune.  We went to primary school together.  He was not lucky to move on to secondary school.  And when I completed my studies, Kajelijeli at one point in time was an accounting officer in Nkuli commune.  And then he was subsequently appointed accounting officer of Mukingo commune.  

There is no particular relation between Kajelijeli and myself right up to the years 1989 -- 1988, 1989.  He was appointed bourgmestre in 1988 and right through to 1993.  So the relations we would have had is that at one point in time -- I believe that was in 1992 -- he had his brother who was studying in Germany and who met a young lady from my wife's family who was also studying in Germany, and they got married there.  And when the war broke out, they were still in Germany.  So if we have to talk about relationship, those are the relations -- or this is the relation that was automatically created by these young students who were -- when they were in Germany in 1991 (sic).

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, with respect to the school, did you sometimes pay the school fees of people from Mukingo so that they could attend ESTB?  
A.	Yes.  In fact, when I set up that project, my idea was to give children who wanted to go and pursue their studies a possibility and also to increase the number of intellectuals in the region.  So at one point in time, because of the war, there were many children, displaced persons, orphans who had problems, and they were suffering.  So I had to give them assistance, not only to that school but other government schools.  And I assisted them to the best of my ability. 
Q.	Did that include Tutsi as well? 
A.	The school was open to all children, and we attempted to find solutions to the problems of all the children.  So there were also Tutsi children, in fact, all the more so as the -- as the brothers running the school were Tutsi.  There were Tutsi teachers.  The case of Witness BTH, he too had problems, and he was able to study in that school.  And, in any case, there was no place for ethnic discrimination in our school. 
Q.	When did you build your own -- build your own house in Mukingo? 
A.	I built my own house where I was living in 1994.  It was built in 1982 -- '81 or '82.  And before that I had another house in the compound of my family -- my father's compound -- in my father and my -- my mother's compound in Byangabo we -- I had a house near my father's house, and that is where I got married in 1976.  But the house in Mukingo, which was supposed to be my residence in 1994, I had built in 1981, along -- it was a big house with attachments.  And I opened the house in 1983 on the occasion of the baptism ceremony of my children. 
Q.	Were you also a member of the technical committee of the Mukingo commune? 
A.	In fact, at one point in time, as I said, I was a director general in the ministry of public works.  And in accordance with the communal law, the commune can request assistance from technicians.  So they can assist the commune to carry out development projects.  And, generally speaking, bourgmestres requested and obtained the assistance of intellectuals and technicians or technical experts who hailed from that area.  And it is, as such, that as a director general and somebody who hailed from Mukingo, I was designated as a member of the technical committee.  That was around 1978. 

Of course, when I became minister, I ceased to attend those meetings, for a simple reason, that when the commission was meeting and the commune had problems to solve, development problems, and the ministry was at that -- I was heading -- was one of the -- the same ministries.  Also all that had to be done was that the problem had to be submitted to me, and in general, I resolved the problem.  So it was not necessary for me to go and attend those meetings. 
Q.	As minister of public works, did you contribute to the development of roads, electricity and water to those people in Mukingo commune and in Ruhengeri? 
A.	Not only Ruhengeri, not only in Mukingo.  I worked for the development of socio-economic infrastructure in the country, the entire country.  I was in charge of roads, water, electricity, 
	territorial development, and even subsequently surveys.  So I used my energy to work for the development of my country, and I believe that the results at the end of the 1980-1990 decade are there. They speak for themselves.  

Before the war, the report from the World Bank on sub-Saharan African countries listed Rwanda amongst well-governed countries and also as a country with one of the best socio-economic infrastructures in Africa.  So I believe that with the coming of the second republic in Rwanda, there was 45 kilometres -- there were 45 kilometres of tarred roads.  When I got into the ministry, there was hardly 200 tarred kilometres.  And when I left, we had gone above a thousand kilometres of tarred roads.  That is to show you that we worked hard, so much so that most of the important areas were linked by 
asphalt roads.  It's only Kibuye préfecture that was remaining, and at the time I was leaving the ministry the project had just been launched because the necessary funds had been obtained. 

We also undertook a wide electrification programme for both urban and rural areas.  That programme was one of the priorities of the country, and we had similarly worked on the programme of supplying potable water to people in the cities and also in rural areas.  We adopted the policy of having water points so that the distance that people had to cover to obtain potable water would be reduced.  That was an option by the republic not to concentrate the development in cities but to spread out to rural areas.  So as far as that point is concerned, I think that the people of Rwanda would not have had to complain.  All their problems were being considered seriously. 
Q.	Can you describe to the Trial Chamber what it would be like when -- in the period 1985 through 1990, when you returned to Mukingo commune on a weekend, tell us what would happen when you arrived, what you would typically do and how you would be received by the population. 
A.	Yes.  First of all, in Mukingo commune or in Ruhengeri or, generally speaking, I was well known.  That is for sure.  And then as a member of parliament I was elected with a reasonable majority, and each time people saw my car they would come and surround my car, where it was, wherever I went to.  Each person had his own complaints or petitions or requests for assistance, but I could not listen to all of them.  Especially because each time I travelled, I was going out for a specific objective, to carry out an activity which would benefit the majority of the people.  So I could not listen to all individual problems.  So when people saw my car, they started running and ended up gathering around my car. 
Q.	And did you sometimes buy beer for members of the population? 
A.	You know, when you are a man of the people, you have to be able to take care of your electorate, the people who elect you.  There are people who are elected, and once they are elected, they only go back to their -- fifth -- five years later.  And, generally speaking, those who elected him punished such a person in an exemplary fashion.  
	So I communicated with members of the population.  I was attentive as far as their problems were concerned, and I tried, as much as possible, to resolve their problems. 

See, if somebody told me that he was thirsty and he needed a hundred francs to buy a beer or -- local beer, I did not have to reflect for long to see that I had to give him a hundred francs.  So I was kind
and -- and open minded. 
Q.	How did the war in October 1990 and the attack in January 1991 change your pattern of going to Mukingo? 
A.	The war had a considerable impact on my trips, because there was a problem of security that came up. When the RPF started guerrilla tactics in November 1991, there were reasons to be afraid.  So for reasons of security, one had to try not to take risks.  So, as a result, I substantially reduced my trips to Mukingo commune between 1990 and 1994.  I went there for very specific and precise reasons.  But I could not afford to organise trips or -- knowing fully well that there were problems.  

When the fighting intensified in the area, I would not have taken the risk to go and spend a night in Mukingo commune.  So I believe that, on this point, people said everything they wanted to say.  There are even witnesses who testified here who could not make a distinction between before 1990 and after 1990.  When I saw the people they referred to as having held meetings with me, people who even claimed that they were members of our associations, I believe that somewhere there was some confusion and they did not understand everything.  And it was perhaps the meetings in the -- or held by those behind the school where they would think that we were planning the killing of Tutsis even before the RPF attack.  So the war had a tremendous impact on my trips to Ruhengeri and Mukingo between 1990 and 1994. 
Q.	As of January 1991, were you still minister of public works? 
A.	No.  As I said -- in fact, those who came and testified here thought that I was minister of only 
	public works.  They did not know that I held other posts.  They did not know when I left.  There are some who thought that right through to 1993 I was still a minister.  But that is the extent of their intelligence.  

But on the 9th of July 1990, President Habyarimana had a cabinet shakeup, and I was moved from the ministry of public works and water resources to the ministry of industries, mines and handicraft.  So as from the 9th of July 1990 right through to the 31st or 30th of December 1991, I was minister of industries, mines and handicraft.  So I had left the ministry of public works. 
Q.	After the RPF attack on Ruhengeri in January 1991, were a series of summits held to try to solve the problems between the RPF and the Rwandan government? 
A.	Yes.  In fact, as I said this morning, President Habyarimana, even if the RPF had been driven out of Rwanda, he was aware that the -- an end had not been put to the conflict and that the problems which were supposed to have been at the root of that conflict had not been solved.  And that is why he continued to make efforts in attempt -- in an attempt to seek a lasting solution -- a lasting and peaceful solution to the war, to the problems faced by refugees and to the problems relating to democratisation.  And there was the Dar es Salaam summit, the Zanzibar summit, the Gbadolite summit, once again.  So there were steps taken in that direction. 
Q.	If you can direct your attention to document number 8 in our packet of exhibits.  This is a communiqué dated the 17th of February 1991, following a meeting in Zanzibar.  Can you tell us what the results of the summit in Zanzibar were on the 17th of February 1991. 
A.	Yes.  Like with the previous communiqué, the Zanzibar communiqué sought to refer to heads of state, the restoration of lasting and sustainable peace.  The idea was also to remind or recall the steps that had been taken during the previous summit, in particular, the solving of the problem concerning Rwandan refugees living in neighbouring countries, in particular, Uganda.

So, in a nutshell, it was a reminder so that -- a reminder for things to move as they should.  So this is the content of this Zanzibar communiqué dated 17th February 1991.  And I would like to draw your attention to point -- points A, B, C, D, and, lastly, point 5.  Those are the points to which I would like to draw the attention of the chamber. 
Q.	Can you briefly summarise those points. 
A.	In fact, that is what I just said.  Point A recommends that an immediate ceasefire be observed from 18th February at 10 o'clock -- at 10 a.m. 

It is also wished that the belligerents should observe the ceasefire.  The presidents of Rwanda and Uganda are requested to accelerate the process of a dialogue as provide -- or stipulated during the Mwanza and the Gbadolite summits -- during the Mwanza and Gbadolite summits.  And the heads of state expressed their satisfaction with the progress made regarding refugees in the context of the regional conference.  They also expressed the wish that the Dar es Salaam summit would provide a definitive solution to the situation.  

The ceasefire referred to here was necessary because of the violation of the first ceasefire, which happened in the night of 22/23 January 1991.  The violation was carried out or made by the RPF when it liberated prisoners from the Ruhengeri prison and waged war for several hours in that country. 
MR. ROBINSON:  
Mr. President, I would ask that this Dar -- this Zanzibar communiqué of 17th February 1991 be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ810. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.
 (Exhibit No. D. NZ810 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, if you can look at number 9 in our package of exhibits.  This is a declaration on the Rwandan refugees' problem issued at Dar es Salaam.  Now, can you tell us what the gist of this communiqué is.  
A.	Yes.  As you can see, this communiqué is the logical follow-up to the Zanzibar communiqué and the
	Dar es Salaam conference, expressly addressed the issue of refugees.  So the concerns or 
	attempts -- and attempts made by the head of state to solve the problem are contained in -- under 
	points 5, A, B, C, and D.  

So I think the Dar es Salaam summit dealt mainly with this refugee problem and also with the ceasefire problem.  But, according to this communiqué, all countries, all participants had to honestly commit themselves to solving this problem, which was considered crucial.  

If you please, I could read one or two paragraphs.  But the communiqué is clear and speaks for itself. 
Q.	Okay.  Go ahead.  
A.	So the communiqué was made in Dar es Salaam.  It is dated 19th February 1991.  And I'm going to read point five.  I will leave out the other points, because those other points refer only to the participation of heads of state and also the presence of the secretary general of OAU.  

Now, I read point 5 in English:  

(Microphone not activated)..."that the fact of the Rwandese refugees is the responsibility of the people of Rwanda and its government.  The government of Rwanda reiterated -- reiterated its commitment to finding a definitive and durable solution to this problem.  In this respect, the government of Rwanda recognises that voluntary repatriation is legitimate right for Rwandese refugees and constitutes a factor for peace and national reconciliation.  

"Undertakes within the spirit of its policy of political openings towards all political groupings to remove all obstacles which impaired the returns of Rwandese refugees -- all obstacles which impaired the return of Rwandese refugees to their country.  

"Is ready to take appropriate steps to facilitate the harmonious return and reintegration in all secteurs of national life of refugees who would have expressed the wish to do so, and to declare a comprehensive general amnesty for refugees as defined by the 19 - 1951 UN Convention and the 1969
OAU convention of -- on refugees.  
"Agrees on the conclusion of the ceasefire agreement and a positive end to the dialogue." 

And they extended the general amnesty:  "And to extend -- to extend the general amnesty to include persons who may have committed acts against the state prior to their departure or during their stay outside the country." 
Q.	And does it appear that there may be a second page to this communiqué? 
A.	In fact, I found this document amongst the documents given to us by the Prosecution.  And I do not think there -- well, there may be a page that is missing, but on reading this communiqué, I found the main point I was looking for.  But apparently the document lacks one page.  I do not know whether the Prosecution can help us to find the missing page or pages.  I found this document in the bundle of documents given to us by the Prosecution.

1515H
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that this Dar es Salaam declaration be admitted as D. NZ811.  And if the Prosecutor would be so kind as to see if they can locate any additional pages, we can add those if they're found. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ811 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, was there a ceasefire agreed to on the 29th of March 1991 at N'sele? 
A.	Yes.  On 29 March 1991, there was a ceasefire agreement called N'sele ceasefire agreement.  N'sele is in Zaire.  The said agreement was reached on the auspices of President Mobutu in Zaire. 
Q.	And was there a summit held in September of 1991 at Gbadolite? 
A.	Yes.  The Gbadolite summit in September 1991 came as a conclusion of the previous summit which, unfortunately, we have not found a document.  But I was able to find just one page regarding the Gbadolite summit, the summit of September 1991, and which refers to the summit of Gbadolite of March 1991.  

I am saying so because I'm aware of these summits.  I was a member of government at the time.  So I was aware of what was happening during all those negotiations since we received reports from the government. 
Q.	And it's exhibit 10 in our packet, the page of the communiqué from the Gbadolite summit that you were able to locate.  
A.	Yes.  This is the only document I was able to find, and it refers to the summit of March 1991.  It also talks about the possibility of deploying a group of the OAU military observers, neutral military observers, which had to monitor the Rwandan/Ugandan border.  Because on the Rwandan side, we were sure the RPF was attacking from Uganda, and when it had problems, it would return to its sanctuary in Uganda.  And since the RPF had adopted the guerrilla tactics, it would make quick strikes and retreat.  So it was, therefore, necessary for the border to be monitored.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that the page of number 10 of our exhibits from Gbadolite summit be admitted as D. NZ812.  

	And again, we would ask the assistance of the Prosecutor.  If they find any additional pages, they can be added.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
On that note, I did just try to look for the following page for what was admitted as D. NZ811, and it appears that we just have this single page.  These are documents that were given to us by the 
	US State Department, and they came in a collection.  They weren't necessarily well organised.  But there's no following page for what was admitted as 811.  And I'll check the other document.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ812 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Were neutral military observers deployed in Rwanda?   
A.	Yes.  OAU military observers were deployed in Rwanda.  They were known as "GOMN". 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
G-O-M-N, I believe.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And was Colonel Setako a member of that organisation? 
A.	Yes, he was a member of that organisation representing the government of Rwanda. 
Q.	Putting the war aside for a moment and going back to politics, was there a commission for the restructuring of the MRND established in 1990 or 1991? 
A.	Yes.  In fact, the situation evolved very quickly.  After the national synthesis committee, there was another committee that was set up by the chairman of the MRND, that is, President Habyarimana.  The purpose of that committee was to restructure the MRND.  This was in anticipation of reforms that had to be carried out.

That committee, when it was created, held its first meeting in February 1991.  When the committee submitted its report, that is, the restructuring committee which was chaired by the 
former minister of the interior, Mr. Faustin Munyazesa -- we should not make any confusion here because there are some people who made a confusion between the committee for the restructuring of the MRND with the synthesis committee chaired by Mr. Édouard Karemera.

These two committees are two separate organs or institutions.  So Munyazesa chaired the committee, the committee that dealt with reforms.  That is how the MRND had to reorganise itself, restructure itself, in order to cope with multiparty politics.  It was when the MRND restructuring committee submitted its report and when Mr. Karemera submitted his report of the synthesis committee that the situation evolved very quickly.  We moved towards reorganising the party and the adoption of the constitution of 10 June 1991.   
Q.	And was an extraordinary MRND conference held in April of 1991? 
A.	Yes.  After receiving these reports, the chairman of the MRND, that is, President Habyarimana, summoned the extraordinary congress of the MRND -- I think on the 18th of April 1991 -- to examine the situation, to examine the reports, the reports of the committee for the restructuring of the MRND but also the report of the national synthesis committee.

It is that extraordinary congress of April 1991 which mandated and gave full powers to President Habyarimana, in his capacity as chairman of the MRND, to carry out or to reform the party and its central committee.  That committee gave him the green light, in view of the situation, to personally carry out those reforms from the month of April.

And that is why you will see later on in the month of May he appointed a new central committee.  The constitution was adopted.  So that congress, which lasted only one day, gave the president full powers to carry out all the necessary reforms and to do so expeditiously. 
Q.	When President Habyarimana appointed a central committee for this transition period to the multiparty system, were you among its members?
A.	I was not a member of the new central committee.  So from that month of May 1991, President Habyarimana, who was also chairman of the MRND party, replaced the former 
	central committee of a single party.  He replaced that former central committee with another 
	central committee which I would describe as a transition central committee.

Its purpose was to carry out management.  And the membership increased from about 
20 to 55 members.  You had five members from each préfecture.  The president appointed the préfet plus four other members from each préfecture to that central committee which I would describe as a transition central committee.

I was no longer a member of the central committee, that is, the new central committee, from May 1991. 
Q.	Now, we've heard evidence that on the 10th of June 1991 a constitution was adopted, on the 
	18th of June 1991, the law on political parties.  After those documents, were other political parties created? 
A.	The constitution, that is, the new constitution, was adopted on 10 June 1991.  And that adoption was immediately followed by the law on political parties which was adopted or passed on 18 June 1991.  The doors were opened, and all burgeoning parties started reorganising themselves.

In any case, in the month of July, at least five political parties came into being. 
Q.	And did the MRND hold a congress again in July of 1991? 
A.	Yes.  In fact, these reforms, reforms of the party, were also intended for the preparation of the 
	MRND congress which in fact became the constituent congress of the MRND, new MRND, the new MRND that came into being on 5 July 1991.  It was borne out of this congress of 5 July 1991. 
Q.	With the advent of the multiparty system, what happened to all the infrastructure of the old MRND? 
A.	In fact, when opposition political parties were created, they had many claims.  They made many claims, and they feared that the MRND, although it changed its structure and had undergone serious changes -- in any case, the new MRND was different from the single old party, the old MRND.  But in spite of this, opposition political parties continued doubting its goodwill as though the MRND still remained a single party.

Therefore, in view of all their grievances or claims, the MRND, through its national secretary who was -- who in 1991 was Mr. Édouard Karemera, made a census of all the property of the old MRND, single party, and officially handed that property to the government.

The property was handed to the minister of finance and the minister of public works who represented the government.  And the property of the MRND, former single party, was thus transferred to the state. 
Q.	And in September of 1991, did the opposition parties create an alliance? 
A.	Yes.  Opposition parties, namely, the MDR, the PL, and the PSD, created a forum for consultations in order to better carry out their political -- or wage their political struggle it would better fight the MRND.  They described that forum as the consultation forum of democratic forces for change. 
Q.	On 30 September 1991, did President Habyarimana make an announcement of a general amnesty?  And if so, what did that entail? 
A.	I think you must have found something in one of the recommendations in that communiqué referring to general amnesty.  There were problems regarding the future of refugees that would return to the country and which had taken up -- who had taken up arms against their own country.  

Crimes, war crimes, were punishable under the prevailing law, the law in force.  And all the participants, or the partners in the negotiations, thought that it was necessary in order to foster reconciliation between the belligerents and particularly with the refugees who had taken up arms against their own country in violation of existing international conventions.  

It was recommended that President Habyarimana should decree general amnesty.  And that was done for all those refugees so that dialogue should be promoted and also rapprochement or reconciliation amongst Rwandan peoples.  

I believe that law was adopted in October 1991 by the parliament, and that is the law that was referred to in the communiqués of the various summits which we saw a short while ago.  And the president, translating words into action, requested that the amnesty be effective.  And his proposal was accepted. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, would you like to take our adjournment at this time?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Thank you very much.

Mr. Robinson, yesterday you had indicated that we needed to consider how we are sitting for the rest of the week.  Do you by now have an idea of how much more time you need?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I think it's possible I could finish on Friday.  I need maybe one more day than I expected.  So I thought I could finish by the end of Thursday.  But now I think I can finish, if you sit on Friday, by the end of that or sometime during the day on Monday if you don't sit on Friday.  Either way is okay.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would you consult with the co-defendant, Ngirumpatse?  

Or should I ask Ngirumpatse now what the position would be?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Regarding this specific problem, I believe I've given my point of view.  I did so on Monday.  I objected to the possibility of sitting on Friday because you are aware that Mr. Ngirumpatse underwent medical exams recently in Nairobi.

It happens that those medical tests indicated the presence of new health problems which require medical care or medical attention.  In fact, it has even been said that he has to return to Nairobi, if he takes his appointment on time, in order to deal with the problems.

So I think Mr. Ngirumpatse is making tremendous efforts to be present here, and we should not abuse of his ability to be present.  Under the circumstances, I think it's preferable for him to be given time to recover on Friday, and he should not be required to be here on Friday.  That is a proposal I wanted to submit to the Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I should mention that we have seen medical reports which resulted from Mr. Ngirumpatse's 
medical examination last week, and they're being filed and circulated with the parties in the case.  I doubt that I would agree with your representation about what those reports reveal.

But simply as a matter of courtesy, I was asking whether he would have consented to sit on Friday.  If the answer is no, the answer is no.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I'm sorry for contradicting you.  I have not officially received a report on the 
	medical examination undergone by my client.  I am referring to a report that Mr. Ngirumpatse handed to me.  Apparently, that report contradicts what you received, the report you received.  So I would like to clarify that point.  I did not receive an official report as you did. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That report has been filed confidential with the parties.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
I am even all the more surprised.  Perhaps my colleagues have received it, but I have not. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There might have been some delay in its filing.  In that case, I would have to apologise to you if it's not been received by you as yet.  But I will make certain it's filed.  I'll make enquiries as soon as we rise.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I heard that actually.  So I can probably just answer that question directly from Judge Joensen.  I know Judge Joensen always asks good questions, and this is evidence of it on the record now.

In any event, we do anticipate that, immediately after Nzirorera's direct examination is completed, that we would ask the Chamber to allow us to interrupt his testimony and to take the three witnesses who will be arriving over the weekend to Arusha.  We expect that those three witnesses will take approximately two days in total, at which time we would be in a position for Mr. Nzirorera to begin his cross-examination if Mr. Webster was ready for that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you.

Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes.  We'll be ready on Wednesday, according to Mr. Robinson's calendar, as soon as Mr. Nzirorera completes his testimony next week.  We'll start right away or make the adjustments that Mr. Robinson suggests.  He's been in contact with us on a daily basis with developments.  So I don't think that it should pose any scheduling problems. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Ms. Hounkpatin, I think we should wait until we actually have a chance to see the official report.  So when we rise, we'll make certain that it's filed, and I'll make sure that you have access to it.  And then we'll make further enquiries tomorrow.   
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I have a serious question, and I would like to state it immediately.  Indeed I am waiting to receive the report that you mentioned.  Mr. Ngirumpatse has also given me documents.  I hope there is no issue giving him what was given to you.  I would like this point to be cleared. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't quite understand you.  I don't know what documents you received.  I suspect that everything might become clearer shortly after we rise this afternoon.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Indeed I hope so because, when I spoke a while ago, you told me that the report I gave did not reflect the report that I was supposed to have received.  My account did not reflect the official report.  It was as if I was just making up stories before your Chamber.  And that is why I wanted to put on record that I have documents that have been given to Mr. Ngirumpatse, and what I explained to you emerges from those documents.  So I was not inventing or making up stories.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The main issue was from the documents that were filed officially.  While it is true that it is recommended that Mr. Ngirumpatse should return for medical check-up, it was stated that he should return in 
six months.  And that's the issue that I raised with -- that seemed to require some commentary.  But we will see, when the documents are submitted, if that coincides with information that you received.

We can adjourn this until tomorrow now.  
(Court adjourned at 1540H)
