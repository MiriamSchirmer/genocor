P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, the 24th May of 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the 
Prosecutor versus Karemera et al., Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

The appearances. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, good morning to everyone, to the Court and to the parties.  I'm pleased to inform the Court that today we -- our appearances aren't the same; we have a new member of our team.  Her name is Maria Wilson.  She comes to us from the ICC.  She's been seconded to the Karemera team. And she's admitted to practice in Trinidad and Tobago and the UK.  So we can welcome her to our trial.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  We welcome you to the proceedings, and we hope you have an interesting and successful tour of duty with us here.
MS. WILSON:
I thank you, Mr. President, for warmly welcoming me.  I am -- I feel privileged and honoured to be here.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  Just to point out to you that I have come back to accompany Édouard Karemera whom I'm defending.  Beside me, Mr. Bernard Munyanziza, investigator.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We welcome you back as well, Madam Diagne.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, we also have a new intern that's beginning today.  Her name is Jessica Asfour.  She's from McGeorge law school in California.  I'm trying to keep up with the Chambers on interns this summer, but I can't do it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  But you're doing -- you're not doing too badly. 

We welcome you as well and hope that you have an enjoyable tour of duty with the -- with our trial.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, before we resume with the testimony of Mr. Nzirorera, I just wanted to inform you of our programme for this week.  I'm going to be leaving this evening so, if you have any questions, it would good if you could put them to me today.  But, in any event, I'll be in touch by email with your Trial Chamber coordinator.  

But first of all, I want to thank you for how quickly you acted with respect to our safe conduct application for Witness 40.  And I appreciate being able to receive that order so quickly.  

It turned out that the WVSS didn't feel they could guarantee his safe arrival in Arusha, and you will find today a motion for a video link, and he's not going to be appearing this week.  

We do have Witness 34 who's here.  I expect Mr. Nzirorera will conclude his testimony today, sometime around the lunch break, and we'll be ready to proceed with Witness 34 as soon as that is finished.  

Tomorrow morning, we have Leon Habyarimana, who is a Rule 92 bis witness, who will be ready to testify when Witness 34 is finished.  

And then Mr. Nzirorera will go back in the box for the remainder of this week to be cross-examined.  And then I'll be back with you on the 7th of June when we resume.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Nzirorera. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Your testimony continues this morning, and you remain under the same oath to tell the truth.  Mr. Robinson will continue.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
JOSEPH NZIRORERA,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Nzirorera.  
A.	Good morning, Mr. Robinson.  
Q.	On Thursday, we had begun to speak about the allegations of Jean-Pierre Turatsinze and the event in which he somehow managed to get access to MRND property, after you had discharged him, to show weapons to UNAMIR in January of 1994.  

Now, I just want to ask you whether or not it would be possible for him, after having been fired by MRND secretariat, to have entered those premises in the evening? 
A.	In any case, the secretariat was guarded by an ordinary guard.  He did not have any weapons.  He was a night watchman.  So I do not know what steps Mr. Turatsinze took to have access to the office.  
Q.	At any time you were present on the MRND premises, did you ever see any weapons there? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Now, were you aware that weapons had been distributed to Robert Kajuga and Turatsinze by the ministry of defence? 
A.	No.  I was never informed.  
Q.	Now, you heard the testimony of Georges Rutaganda who testified that in -- sometime in February 1994, after the assassination of Gatabazi, he attended a meeting at which it was revealed to him for the first time that weapons had been made available by the minister of defence to Kajuga and Turatsinze.  Did you have any information about that at all during your time in Rwanda? 
A.	No.  I did not have that piece of information.  
Q.	When was the first time you learned of that? 
A.	Perhaps to summarise, somewhat, all this business regarding possible distribution of weapons, 
first of all, this was spread by opposition parties which were accusing the MRND of all sorts of evils and making these accusations to UNAMIR.  They were preparing tracts.  And, at one point in time, they talked about it so much that nobody believed them.  

So this whole story of Turatsinze talking about those weapons, we heard that mostly when we were in exile.  And we heard that Turatsinze received weapons and had sold them -- that is, rather, what we heard.  But frankly speaking, when we were in Kigali, not so much was said of it.  
Q.	Now, on the 12th of January, you met with representatives of UNAMIR; correct? 
A.	Yes.  We met Mr. Booh-Booh and Mr. Dallaire on the 12th of April (sic) in the afternoon, around 4 p.m., at the headquarters of UNAMIR.  I was with Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  
Q.	And at that meeting, did you tell them that you didn't know anything about weapon caches by the MRND and Interahamwe? 
A.	When that matter was brought before us, we were rather surprised and we suggested -- in fact, we said that we were surprised and that we were not aware of those weapons.  And in due course, we asked UNAMIR to contact the Interahamwe committee to make them understand that we had no role to play in that.  
Q.	I think there may have been a translation error.  We're speaking of the 12th of January; correct? 
A.	The 12th of January 1994.  I am sorry if I said 12th April, but it was the 12th of January 1994 at 4 p.m.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  And were you telling the truth?  Did you -- you didn't -- you did not, in fact, know about any such weapons? 
A.	We were telling the truth.  We were telling the truth.  And up till today, I am telling the truth.  We told UNAMIR that we were unaware of those weapons and that they were free to contact the Interahamwe committee and find those weapons wherever they were -- and that they could even seize them.  We were telling the truth, and we were frank with them.  
Q.	Now, it appears that Jean-Pierre Turatsinze also told UNAMIR that there was military training of the Interahamwe.  Was there? 
A.	I learnt of that later.  It would appear the people who told us said that weapons had been distributed, but that was not true.  
Q.	But now I'm asking you about military training.  In -- it appears that Turatsinze told UNAMIR that the Interahamwe had been trained -- military -- had received military training.  Is that true? 
A.	No.  That is not true.  That is false.  
Q.	Were you aware -- were you aware of any training -- any military training that was given to the Interahamwe prior to the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	No, I was not.  And I have never been aware of any military training given to Interahamwe.  If I can say something, I would say that, in fact, during the war, the Rwandan army had its military strength.  And if there were young people, it would concern all parties.  But to say that the MRND party organised training for the Interahamwe, I can vouch that that is not true.  And you know that, as far as military training is concerned -- as far as military recruitment was concerned, all the military leaders who testified here testified to that.  

The Rwandan army went from 6,000 to 25 -- 35 -- 35,000 people in 1994.  And all these were young people who were being recruited, young people from the whole country.  If amongst them there were some who were supposed to have been Interahamwe, that would be understandable.  But I am unaware of any special measures taken by the MRND requesting young people to be sent for training -- or training for a purpose that we are unaware of.  

In fact, some people say that these people were supposed to protect leaders of the MRND.  Under such conditions, I do not see why I myself would not have been protected by one of them because, as from 1993, we were being told about people who had been trained in Mutara, about weapons that had been distributed, and, quite strangely, I wrote a letter to UNAMIR asking for protection.  

Why did I not ask one of these young people to come and protect me?  People who had received military training and were in possession of weapons?  So I have my doubts about those statements or assertions.  

It is true that the opposition, in order to fight against the MRND, spread such information, but I do not know any team that was sent for training under the supervision of -- or at the request of the MRND.  I'm sorry I had to develop this a little more.  
Q.	Okay.  Were you aware of any lists of Tutsis ever being compiled by the MRND or the Interahamwe? 
A.	Never.  Such lists never existed.  
Q.	Were you aware of any plan to kill Belgian soldiers? 
A.	No.  That plan never existed either.  
Q.	Directing your attention to the 16th of January 1994, did you attend the rally at Nyamirambo stadium in which Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Justin Mugenzi spoke? 
A.	Yes.  I was present at that rally.  
Q.	Did you make a speech? 
A.	No.  I made no speech.  
Q.	Did you understand any of the speeches to be calling for the extermination of Tutsi? 
A.	No.  I listened to all the speeches, and none of them was inciting the population to kill one another or to kill any group in particular.  
Q.	Now, during this period in January, after the swearing-in of President Habyarimana had taken place and the swearing-in of the remaining members of the transitional government had failed, did you attend a series of meetings in order to try to solve the problems that led to the blockage of the broad-based transitional government? 
A.	Yes.  We took part in a number of meetings.  Some of those meetings were either convened by UNAMIR, the representative of the UN Secretary General, or by the prime minister designate.  So we did take part in meetings, in particular, in the month of February 1994.  
Q.	And can you tell the Trial Chamber what was basically the problem during that period.  
A.	The fundamental problem, as you might guess, was related to the setting up of the broad-based transitional institutions.  After the swearing-in ceremony by the president of the republic, what was remaining was to set up the broad-based transitional government and also constitute the transitional national assembly.  

But there were problems that still existed within the political parties, in particular, the PL and the MDR regarding the choice of representatives of these parties into these institutions.  That was the fundamental problem.  That is where it lay.  
Q.	Now, I'd like you to look at exhibits 29, 30, 31 and 32 in our packet of exhibits, which deal with a series of meetings that took place in mid-February of 1994.  Looking at exhibit 29 first, do you recognise that? 
A.	Yes.  I'm familiar with the text.  It's a Radio Rwanda programme on the 16th of February 1994.  
Q.	And what is the situation on the 16th of February that's being reported? 
A.	In fact, this meeting of the 16th of February was directly in line with all the meetings that had been organised as from the 7th of February 1994, to attempt to find solutions to the persisting problem within the MDR and the PL with a view to setting up the transitional institutions.  And it turned out that during those meetings some of the parties sent representatives; others did not.  Or in some parties, some factions did not want to attend the meetings.  That is what I can say.  
Q.	On the 16th of February, did the RPF attend that meeting? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And did you and Mathieu and Édouard Karemera also attend? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And did you have cordial relations with the representatives of the RPF during your meetings? 
A.	Cordial, no.  But we tried to discuss and come to an agreement about the most correct way of coming out of the stalemate. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would ask that the document number 29 in my bundle of exhibits be admitted as D. NZ824. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, in principle, I have no objection.  But I'd like to know the contents.  This is a document in Kinyarwanda.  I don't see how it helps us to admit the document now when no one understands its -- its contents.  Mr. Nzirorera has given his response.  If that's not sufficient, then the document can assist his Defence -- then we should have him read the relevant portions into the record so I know exactly -- we all can understand exactly what it says.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  Mr. President, I was hoping that some day this document could be translated into all of the languages of the -- working languages.  But in the meantime, if Mr. Webster would like to know its contents, I could ask Mr. Nzirorera to read the relevant part, if that's helpful.  

So I'm asking Mr. Webster, through the Chamber, if he would like to have him read at this point.  

MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, please, and if he could indicate where he's reading from.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, looking at this document number 29, starting on the second page where peacemaker Mbungiramihigo is speaking, can you read that paragraph that ends with Karemera's name.  
A.	Yes.  In fact, this Radio Rwanda programme on page 12, first of all, shows the parties which were represented, the names of the representatives and also the names of parties which did not have representatives.  And on page 13, it is said -- let me read out the text in Kinyarwanda so that the content can be understood.  

On page 13, from line 2, it is said...(microphones overlapping)  
MR. WEBSTER:
(Microphones overlapping)...Mr. Nzirorera...(microphones overlapping)...that we know exactly what is being said.  My impression was that he was just summarising it again in his last response, and if he could start where Mr. Robinson directed him until we get to the end of what's relevant, then that would assist us.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Mr. Nzirorera, start reading right where peacemaker begins to speak, and you can conclude when you think that the relevant portion is finished.  
A.	Okay.  "The minister or ministers of the broad-based transition government, that is, Minister Faustin Twagirumungu, held a meeting yesterday with the representatives of political parties that should participate in that government, that is, the broad-based transition government.  That meeting was held at the Méridien hotel, Umubano, here in Kigali.  

"The meeting was held in closed session.  The meeting examined the document presented by the MRND party.  The paper talked about relations with other political parties during this transition period.  

"We would like to recall that this meeting was held yesterday in the evening, but that the meeting should have been held in the morning.  

"The representatives of parties of the countries that followed up the negotiations of the Arusha Accords also had to participate in that meeting.  These countries are the United States of America, France, Belgium and Germany, as well as the representative of the mediators.  

"However, we noticed that during this meeting, which was held yesterday in the evening, these persons were not present.  Furthermore, the PL party, the faction led by Justin Mugenzi, as well as the MDR party, that is, the faction led by Dr. Dismas Nsengiyaremye, these factions did not participate in the meeting.  

"The PL party was represented by Landouald Ndasingwa.  The PSD party was represented by its chairman, Frédéric Nzamurambaho, Félicien Gatabazi, Ngango, as well as Gafaranga.  

"The PDC party was represented by its chairman, Nayinzira, while the RPF was represented by Tito Rutaremara, Pasteur Bizimungu and Patrick Mazimpaka.  

"The MRND party was represented by its chairman, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera and Édouard Karemera.  

"We also inform you that the prime minister of the broad-based transition government" -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, says the Kinyarwanda booth. 
THE WITNESS:
"We are informing you that the prime minister of the current government, Mrs. Agathe Uwilingiyimana, also attended that meeting.  

"The meeting was held in closed session and concluded its deliberations at about 11:30 p.m.  

"Participants at the meeting agreed to resume discussions the following day, that is, Friday, in order to examine the issue of the PL party, as well as that of the MDR party.  

"Participants had to agree on a meeting during which the institutions of the broad-based transitional government would be put in place.  

"We'd also like to remind you that the representatives of the African countries based in Rwanda, as well as the representative of the OAU in Rwanda yesterday received the representative of the United Nations in Rwanda, Dr. Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh.  

"They informed him of the problems they had -- or, rather, the worries that they have because politicians continue blocking the putting in place of the institutions of the broad-based transition government."

That is the end of the passage.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Nzirorera.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And I ask that it be admitted as D. NZ824.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ824 admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, can you turn to document 30, please.  
A.	Oui.
Q.	Now, in this document dated the 18th of February, did you yourself speak on the radio? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And directing your attention to page 4 of that exhibit -- I think it's probably better, although it's a lot to ask, for you to simply read what you said.  Read out loud so that it can be interpreted, so everyone will know the exact text.  Yes, I know it's a long text, but it seems like that's the best way to proceed.  
A.	Very well.  "Nzirorera:  I thank you, Mr. Chairman of the meeting.  

"I think the question asked is related to amnesty, I mean, pardoning certain people.  And that amnesty is contained in the document that we have submitted.  

"We have examined the document.  We considered it on the 16th.  I would like to tell you that some people misunderstood the content of the document.  If the MRND made such a proposal, well, I would like to underscore that what we heard people say outside our meeting now enables us to clarify what was said and also to rebut what was said outside our meeting.  

"Some people thought that the MRND wanted to apologise for reprehensible acts it allegedly committed and that the MRND was in the process of asking for amnesty for some of its members.

"I would like to tell the journalist that this is not true.  This is not true.  If a member of the MRND has committed any punishable act, such a person will be prosecuted for such acts and justice will take its course.  That person will be punished accordingly.  

"If ever such persons" -- "if anyone, rather, thinks that there is a MRND member who committed any reprehensible or punishable act, the MRND cannot ask that a law amnesty be passed simply because some of its members may have committed reprehensible acts.  

"Why have we, therefore, submitted this document?  It is because on the 15th -- the 
15th of November 1991, a law voted by the national development council -- a law passed by the national development council was passed regarding all matters relating to war.  

"On that occasion, a general amnesty was decreed for all these reprehensible acts because fighting had taken place inside the country.  Subsequently, when we had to put in place the broad-based transition institutions, the MRND party had the idea -- and we pointed out that, after that date, fighting resumed.  

"We thought that the fighting or the war which was waged amongst Rwandans would require reconciliation -- reconciliation between the belligerents without saying that this or that person was the attacker.  

"When we presented this document, we were referring to that war -- to that fighting amongst Rwandans because fighting resumed.  We thought it was necessary for another general amnesty to be decreed.  

"Secondly, you are aware that in the meantime there were many punishable acts and that, furthermore, there are people who are still in detention.  There are people who illegally took other people's property.  

"I would also say that there are even people who have been tried and that others escaped from prison.  I would add that, amongst those persons who escaped from prison, there are some who even occupied important positions.  

"We think that -- well, this new law on the general amnesty should also refer to all these people so 
that" -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, it would appear that the speaker is reading and the Kinyarwanda booth is not able to cope. 
THE WITNESS:
(Microphones overlapping)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Excuse me.
THE WITNESS:
Oui, Monsieur le Président?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you -- the interpreters didn't quite get the last part of what you read.  So could you please do it over and a bit more slowly.  

THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  

"We think that such persons should be mentioned in this law on general amnesty.  We think that this law on general amnesty should be clear regarding all these people, so that later on this law on general amnesty should not undermine the rights of any individual.  

"On the whole, it is our wish that this law on general amnesty should supplement the first law on general amnesty, following the war that resumed after the passing of the first law on general amnesty.  
This law on general amnesty was passed on 15 November 1991.  

"I would like my proposal to be accepted by participants at this meeting.  

"As regards the matter raised once more, and concerning the entry into the broad-based transition government of members of the PL party or the MDR party, this morning the representative of the PL party -- the representatives of that party, the PL party, that is, said that according to them, the broad-based transition government institutions should not be put in place without the participation or presence of the PL members.  

"Mr. President, I believe you heard so -- or you heard this yourself.  

"I understand that the representative of the MDR -- the representatives of the MDR had the same idea."  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness makes a correction.  
THE WITNESS:
"We think that the members of the MDR party have the same problem.  We think a party like the MDR, a party like the PL has an important role to play concerning the Arusha Accords, and that is a wish shared by all of us.  The MRND party supports that position.  

"We hope that all these institutions will be put in place when all these parties are ready to participate in them.  We say so because these parties played an important role in the drafting of the constitution.  They also played an important role in the Arusha Accords.  

"A party like the MDR proposed a candidate for the position of prime minister.  The PL party must propose a candidate, just like the PSD party which must propose a party -- a candidate, rather, for the national assembly.  

"We, therefore, think that these parties are important political parties which should not be overlooked.  And in this way, the transition institutions should comprise members of these political parties.  That is why the proposals that were made this morning and which we all supported -- we hope that these parties which decided to participate in these institutions -- we hope that their problems be -- will be discussed and that a solution will be found to such problems on Tuesday.  In that way, all institutions will be put in place as envisaged.  

"Within the MRND, we think that the worries we had as at then, the worries we had in the past -- that these parties could not participate in the institutions no longer apply because those concerned have assured us that they are going to find solutions to their problems.  

"For my part, I personally think -- or, rather, I believe in what they say, and I support their position.  Consequently, the difficulties we had before no longer exist because the representatives of these parties have just reassured us.  

"Instead of wondering about what will happen at a moment when the two parties are sitting around the same table and that they are promising that they will find a solution to their problem, we cannot doubt the good faith of these two parties, which are reassuring us that they will find a solution to their problem today or tomorrow.  I think we should credit them with good faith.  

"Mr. Chairman, I think we should positively view the position of these parties.  And we hope that next Monday we will have lists of members of these parties.  We hope there will only be one list and not lists of two factions, as agreed during this meeting and as you announced.  We hope the PL party will present only one list and that the MDR will also present only one list.  

"I thank you, Mr. Chairman."
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, may this document now be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ825.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ825 admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, turning to the topic of amnesty, did the MRND and President Habyarimana have concerns that once the Arusha Accords were implemented, people could be prosecuted by the new government? 
A.	Well, in fact, what happened on the 15th and the 16th -- and later on in this meeting of the 21st, at some point in time, as it is said in the declaration, the Rwandan government was asked to decree a general amnesty for refugees -- the refugees who had taken up arms against their own country.  

It was said that the RPF was going to come and participate in the management of the country.  And that for that reason, the RPF, which comprised Tutsi refugees having taken up arms against their own country in violation of international conventions in this area, it was recommended that a general amnesty be decreed.  

On the same occasion it was admitted that -- or acknowledged that during that amnesty period crimes were committed, that the RPF took -- resumed hostilities and that were -- that there were hostilities against the Tutsis inside the country.  

The law on the amnesty -- the law on the amnesty was adopted on 15 October 1991.  Later on, when the amnesty was decreed, things seemed to be working smoothly and the Arusha Accords took place in this atmosphere of reconciliation and understanding, reconciliation amongst a people who wanted to work for the development of its country.  

However, subsequently, there were several violations of the ceasefire agreement by the RPF, and this led to new crimes -- war crimes which were committed during the various RPF attacks.  That was the case in the month of June.  

First of all, in October 1991, the -- or crimes committed in June 1992 -- further crimes were committed.  We had the spectacular attack -- attack of 8 February 1993.  But what happened in this context is that later on there is the RPF document entitled, quote/unquote, Environnement actuel, that is, 
"Present environment" -- "Present and Future Environment of the Organisation". 

This document reflected the war strategy of the RPF.  I believe this document has been accepted or admitted into evidence.  But if that is not the case, I have brought a copy with me.  

This document in scenario number 4 is very clear.  It envisaged institutions that would not stand on -- stand on a firm footing, institutions emanating from the Arusha Accords.  

In fact, this document also envisaged, according to the RPF, that even after the putting in place of the transitional institutions, the RPF was going to put aside -- keep behind it what it described as a 
striking force, so that at some point in time, nine months at most after the signing of the Arusha Accords, President Habyarimana would have been put away -- President Habyarimana and his allies.  This was the RPF document.

Subsequent events were clear.  The Arusha Accords were signed on 4 August -- 4 August 1993, within the nine months, that is, on the 6th of April.  In fact, on the 6th of April, Habyarimana was indeed killed.  So he was put aside as the RPF had envisaged.  

So when this document was discovered, we brought it to that meeting so that it should be discussed.  And it is for this reason that somehow the meeting referred to had to be held in closed session.  It had to be held in closed session because of this document -- the RPF document.  

And as you have noticed, the representative of the RPF -- the representatives of political parties like the MDR, the PL, the same parties that had initially insisted or to have internat -- or, rather, general amnesty because of war crimes, on the MDR -- in fact, the MDR had raised the problem of the violation of the ceasefire and the consequences caused by such violations.  In particular, the massacres caused by the RPF, in particular on the 8th of February 1993 -- it was requested that this amnesty law be completed or supplemented, especially as the RPF was suspected that, once more, it will commit crimes on -- with this document.

We requested that a declaration denouncing this document be signed.  But the RPF and its allies refused to sign such a document.  We understood, and we said no.  The -- we said that the MRND sought to be reassured that, as a matter of fact, the Arusha Accords will be respected by the signatory parties because this document is very telling.  

And it was at that moment that, rather than understand that the RPF committed the same war crimes which it committed when it attacked in October 1990, rather than understand that after these repeated attacks by the RPF there were reprisals against the Tutsi population -- and that it was necessary at the same time to heal all the wounds so as to put this behind us.  

At the time we were about to set up these transitional institutions, the RPF had another demonic plan.  And that is how they started saying, "Well, the MRND is looking or seeking for amnesty", which was not necessary.  In their language, it is manipulation, misinformation, the poisoning of minds.  And that was the purpose of these meetings.  And that is what I explained in this communiqué.  

Otherwise, in the introduction I said that, if someone had committed crimes, they had to be prosecuted as an individual, but neither President Habyarimana, the MRND, nor any other member -- nobody 
was -- felt guilty of anything.  If anybody had to feel guilty, it was the initiator of the war.  

So that is what I wanted to say clearly.  I'm sorry for having been lengthy on this matter.  Certainly, we'll revisit it.  Thank you.  
Q.	So just to be clear, are you saying that President Habyarimana and the MRND never sought any amnesty or immunity for themselves?  Yes or no.  
A.	Never.  Never.  
Q.	Okay.  Now, moving on to the 21st of February, looking at document number 31, do you recognise that? 
A.	Yes, I recognise the document.  
Q.	And what is it? 
A.	This document sort of repeats the MRND's position after the political bureau meeting which was held on the problems regarding the setting up of transition institutions and, in particular, problems that resulted from the setting up of transitional institutions without the PL and the MDR.  So the MRND stand is contained in this document -- in the communiqué that it released on that day.  
Q.	Now, if you could read us the MRND communiqué which I believe starts on page K0148277 and continues until the first paragraph of the next page.  So can you read us the MRND communiqué issued on the 21st of February.  
A.	Very well.  This communiqué comes from the political bureau of MRND.  

"The MRND political bureau met today at Kimihurura at the party headquarters and conceded the political problem that the country's currently facing and declares as follows to the people of Rwanda:  

"Firstly, the MRND political bureau is worried by the fact that, up till this point, there is no list of members of parliament or ministers, and institutions have not been set up as decided during the meeting of the 18th of this month.  And that meeting brought together representatives of political parties and the RPF, as well as people who had problems with their political parties, in particular, 
Justin Mugenzi and Landouald Ndasingwa who were members of the PL party and the steering committee of the MDR party.  

"Secondly, the MRND political bureau feels that those lists are not available, and so these institutions should not be set up if the MDR and PL are not represented in the institutions, given that those parties played an important role for -- for -- an important role concerning the creation of the institutions.  

"We'd like to say the -- whether there should be seven ministers and 22 members of parliament and the PL should present a candidate for the post of the president of the national assembly.  It is as a result of what took place throughout the country and, in particular, in Kigali that we are raising this issue.  

"Thirdly, the MRND political bureau is once more requesting officials of these political parties which are facing problems, the MDR and the PL, to come to an agreement and get the country out of this stalemate.  
"Fourthly, and lastly, the political bureau took the opportunity to publicly denounce the lies which were told on Sunday, that is, during the rally that was chaired by Faustin Twagiramungu during which they dared to say that the protests that had taken place -- or activities that had taken place had been prepared and organised by the MRND.  

"The MRND would like to tell all Rwandans that, as a party, it did not play any role in organising the activities that took place yesterday."  

This is a communiqué from the -- I've just read to you a communiqué from the political bureau of the MRND, signed by the secretary general of that party, Joseph Nzirorera.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And Mr. President, I would ask that document number 31 in my bundle be admitted as D. NZ826.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ826 admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Mr. Nzirorera, on that say day, looking at document number 32, was there an address by President Habyarimana concerning the prevailing problem of trying to install the broad-based transitional government? 
A.	Yes.  President Habyarimana was interviewed by a journalist following his discussion with Mr. Claes, the vice-minister -- or prime minister and minister of foreign affairs of Belgium.  
Q.	Fortunately, this is in French.  And it's only myself and Judge Byron who will be mostly ignorant of its contents, so can you summarise what President Habyarimana said on this occasion. 
A.	Yes.  A journalist went up to President Habyarimana and on the whole, he -- he was accused of being responsible for holding back the institution of the broad-based -- or the installation of the broad-based institutions.  And President Habyarimana says that that is not true.  And he adds that, if everything depended on him, this would be done already.  But he explained that -- unfortunately, that there were things that were beyond his control.  

And then, secondly, he also talked about the ethnic problem.  And he was saying that ethnic groups do exist, that he is not the one who created them, but those ethnic groups should not serve as a pretext for division to be encouraged amongst Rwandans and that, to the contrary, they should supplement each other because each ethnic group needs the presence of the other to be able to live in Rwanda.  

Those are the two topics that the president emphasised.  

And he said that, on the 5th of January, he was present, and he gave them an appointment for the afternoon.  People did not show up.  He could not do anything.  And he said that, whenever they are ready, he would be available.  

That is a brief summary of this president's interview, and it is quite clear.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'd ask that this be admitted as D. NZ827, which is number 32 in my packet.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ827 admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Was there a swearing-in ceremony for the installation of the transitional institutions scheduled for the 22nd of February?
A.	Yes.  After all these activities during the month of February, we had agreed that everything should be done to get the transitional institutions working on the 22nd of February 1994.  And the -- the foreign minister of the kingdom of Belgium was there too.  He had just made his contribution to the situation in spite of the problems.  That date had already been announced.  And surprisingly, the day before, Minister Gatabazi, who was the secretary general of the PSD party and who also had to be a minister, was assassinated.  

He was murdered.  And immediately thereafter as usual, people accused the MRND and President Habyarimana of having organised the murder of Gatabazi in order to get the implementation of the -- or the installation of the institutions to fail.  And today, the truth lies elsewhere.  
Q.	Did the MRND or President Habyarimana have anything to do with the assassination of Minister Gatabazi? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I am objecting to that question, unless Mr. Robinson is going to lay a foundation for how this witness will be able to give an opinion.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I can make it more specific. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Did you have anything to do with the assassination of Minister Gatabazi? 
A.	Nothing at all.  
Q.	And do you know who was responsible for that assassination? 
A.	No.  We did not know who was responsible for the murder.  Quite simply, we were accused of having organised the assassination, but we think that just as the -- the -- Gapfizi's murder was organised, we think that it was the same commando group that organised Gatabazi's murder.  And history proved us right.  And I'm sure during the -- mirror -- the mirror allegations, the Prosecutor will come back to it.  
Those allegations were made against the MRND and President Habyarimana on all international 
radio stations, and today, I think we know a little more about it.  
Q.	And since those allegations were made, has it come to light that a group of RPF technicians were responsible for that assassination? 
A.	Today, we have documents which show that it is the RPF -- the commando of the RPF which killed Gatabazi, and that is the same one that killed Gapfizi.  That has been documented.  And even the RPF confirms that, so there is no doubt as far as that is concerned.  
Q.	On the 23rd of February 1994, was Martin Bucyana, the president of the CDR party, assassinated? 
A.	Yes.  Martin Bucyana was assassinated at Butare, and it was said that it was as a reprisal for the killing of Gatabazi.  But we have information also that it was the PSD youth wing along with young people of the MDR who organised the murder of Martin Bucyana.  
Q.	Did the MRND have anything to do with his assassination? 
A.	Not at all.  
Q.	Did the MRND hold a meeting at Rwamagana in February 1994? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Where is Rwamagana? 
A.	Rwamagana is a locality.  It was a sort of sous-préfecture about 58 kilometres from Kigali in the direction of the east, towards Kibungo.  
Q.	Did you attend that rally? 
A.	No, I did not attend that rally.  I was not there.  Mathieu was not there.  We were held back attending a meeting with UNAMIR in Kigali, and the MRND was represented by the MRND chairman in Kibungo area, who was the vice-president, who was the -- Kabagema, spelt K-A-B-E -- K-A-B-A-G-E-M-A. Ferdinand Kabagema.  He was the second vice-chairman of the MRND and chairman of the MRND in Kibungo.  And he attended the meeting with Karemera, and I think that the report of that meeting is -- has been admitted as an exhibit in this matter, and I think what I'm saying is correct.  
Q.	Now, directing your attention to the 27th of February 1994, was there a meeting on that day to make yet another attempt to set up the transitional institutions? 
A.	After the failure of the 22nd of February to set up the institutions, after the murder of Gatabazi and Martin Bucyana, there were riots and a few clashes, some unrest.  But when the situation calmed down, as early as the 25th, President Habyarimana convened a meeting bringing together around him all the political parties which were taking part in the peace process in Arusha.  And on the 26th, he gave people a chance to meet.  And on the 27th, we continued our meeting till late in the night and -- and then there was a communiqué which was signed on the 27th of February 1994.  
Q.	That communiqué is already in evidence as D. NZ508.  Can you tell us the result of those meetings on the 27th. 
A.	Yes.  During that meeting, President Habyarimana was trying to mediate and see if we could come out of the stalemate.  The representative of the UN Secretary General and the diplomatic corps were insisting that he himself should carry out the mediation with a view to finding a solution to the problems of the MDR and the PL.  

We took part.  Some parties sent representatives.  But we did issue a communiqué, and in that communiqué, in order to break the deadlock, we proposed that the parties, which had problems and which had been asked to give priority to understanding and take into consideration the laws -- it was agreed that each party -- the PL, which had three ministers and 11 members of parliament, we suggested a formula which was referred to as 5-6 and 6-5, which implied that 5-6 at the level of the government involved 2-1 in the government.  And the formula 2...

Five meant 1 and 2 in the government.  What did this mean exactly? 

The PL and the MDR each had 11 members of parliament and three ministers, which meant that they had 14.  That was simple arithmetic.  And so we said that the faction that has two ministers would have five members of parliament, and when -- the one with one minister would have six members of parliament.  So we could not have half a minister or half a member of parliament, so we had to arrive at an agreement.  

So we suggested a compromise in a view -- in a bid to solve the existing problem.  All the more so, as within the MDR they had a prime minister designate too, and they could count on the faction from which this prime minister designate came.  And within the PL, it was conceded that the PL had to present a candidate that would compete with another candidate from the PSD for the position of president of the national assembly.  

So the PL and the PSD were supposed to provide one candidate each, and then these two candidates would be brought before the national assembly so that a president of the national assembly could be elected.  

I'm taking this opportunity to say this and to tell the Prosecutor -- because I was there.  He had said that Mr. Ngango had been the president of the national assembly.  That that was not said.  He was supposed to compete with a candidate of the Parti libéral.  

So it should not be said that Ngango was killed and he was the president of the assembly.  That would be false, as false as false can be.  There's nothing that guarantees that Ngango was supposed to be elected against the PL candidate.  

So, broadly speaking, that is the content of the communiqué.  It was proposing the solutions I just gave.  And the parties which were present had accepted.  It was only subsequently that Mr. Lando, who had taken part in the meeting -- I think that after that somebody influenced him, and he did not want to sign the communiqué.  And, once again, even the formula we proposed did not work out.  But that communiqué was sent out on that day.

1030H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And throughout the month of March 1994, were efforts made to solve the problems that blocked the implementation of the Arusha Accords? 
A.	Yes.  The efforts were continued in March to attempt to have those institutions operating.  For example, on the 25th of March, the RPF did not show up.  It just did not show up.  And, in fact, as from the month of February, the RPF had called back all its official -- all its officers to Mulindi.  So they were no longer in Kigali.  They only maintained a battalion, and the -- that battalion was supposed to be protecting the officers.  And when the officers left, the battalion remained in Kigali. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, would you like to take our mid-morning recess at this time?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We take the mid-morning recess now.
(Court recessed from 1032H to 1101H) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, in the middle of March of 1994, was there a massacre at a place called Cyohoha-Rukeri? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And where was that located? 
A.	The Cyohoha-Rukeri locality -- let me spell it.  Cyohoha, C-Y-O-H-O-H-A, and Rukeri, R-U-K-E-L-I (sic).  This is a region which is in the demilitarised zone but towards Byumba préfecture, and it is midway between two préfectures.  

And there there were tea plantations.  And on the 15th of March 1994, the FPR -- the RPF launched an ambush, and there were people in the -- working in the tea factory who were killed, including the manager of that factory and also a member of parliament who had been designated from the Parti libéral.  This was on the 15th of March 1994 when these attempts (sic) took place. 
Q.	And directing your attention to document number 34 in our bundle of exhibits, did the MRND, and in particular you, issue a communiqué concerning these events? 
A.	Yes.  Following that murder the MRND political bureau met and condemned the attack and issued a communiqué to that effect.  So the MRND political bureau condemned that murder. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
And, Mr. President, may I enquire of Mr. Webster whether he would like that entire communiqué read. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I realise it's quite cumbersome, but yes, I -- I would appreciate it being read because we don't understand it.  And I -- I've been looking for these documents in Z-FIND, and the ones that Mr. Robinson has provided only in Kinyarwanda, we don't have translations for.  So if it's going to be offered in evidence, I'd like to understand its contents. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
There's no problem. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Mr. Nzirorera, can you please read the communiqué of the MRND.  
A.	Yes.  I can start towards the end of page 4.  Towards the end there is "Imaze guterana".  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
From the Kinyarwanda booth, could the witness tell us the line. 
THE WITNESS:
Eight lines from the bottom.  "Yesterday the political bureau of the MRND party met.  And after that meeting the bureau issued a communiqué.  And the communiqué reads as follows:  'After the shameful criminal acts committed by the RPF against employees of the tea project in Cyohoha-Rukeri on the 15th of March 1994, the MRND political bureau met yesterday and considered the security problems and deemed it proper to tell Rwandans the following:  

	"Firstly, MRND, once more, condemns such criminal acts which are shameful, acts which the RPF continues to commit against innocent members of the population.  For the MRND these acts are not different from those which were committed in Kirambo sous-préfecture and in Mutura and Bwisige communes.  

"Secondly, the MRND has no doubt and understands that these are part of the RPF criminal plans with a view to shedding the blood of innocent people and undermining the setting up of broad-based institutions that have been the -- provided for in the Arusha Accords.  

"Thirdly, the MRND continues to ask UNAMIR to do its job, that is, protect the population of that demilitarised zone.  RPF should leave that region definitively.  UNAMIR is also requested to stop hiding criminal acts committed by the RPF.  And UNAMIR is also requested to publish the findings of investigations that were carried out regarding the shameful criminal acts committed against innocent people in Kirambo sous-préfecture and in Mutura and Bwisige communes.  Once again, the MRND finds that if UNAMIR continues to leave aside -- or not to fulfil its responsibility, the matter will be brought to the attention of the representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations.  

"Fourthly, the MRND is asking the government to hold a meeting as soon as possible to reach decisions regarding the death of those concerned and also to take firm decisions with a view to putting an end to these activities once and for all.  

"MRND would once again like to remind the government to do its prime duty, which is the protection of the population.  Or else a government -- or such a government which is of no use to -- decisions should be taken against that government which is of no use to members of pop -- of the population.  

"The MRND would like to inform the RPF that it will not continue to put up with that attitude and -- and not react to it -- and that for a while criminal acts have been committed against innocent members of the population.  

"Seventh and last point, MRND sympathises with members who have suffered during these difficult times we are going through.  Kigali, 16th March 1994.'"  And the communiqué is signed by the secretary general of MRND, Joseph Nzirorera. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, may this number 34 in my packet of exhibits be admitted as D. NZ828. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ828 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, if you could turn now to pack -- number 36 in my packet.  And I want to direct your attention to the 24th of March 1994.  On that day did the prime minister, Agathe Uwilingiyimana, transmit to the president a list of members of the broad-based transitional government to be sworn in? 
A.	Yes.  That is correct. 
Q.	And is number -- packet -- number 36 in our packet, is that the list? 
A.	Yes.  This is the letter written by the prime minister to the president of the republic. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that this document 36 in our packet -- or actually, I think it's -- maybe it's already in evidence as 4 -- D. NZ491.  I'm sorry.  I don't need to ask that it be admitted.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Mr. Nzirorera, did, in fact, the government and these deputies get sworn in on the 25th of March as scheduled? 
A.	The prime minister is referring to the conversation with the president of the republic.  And they had agreed that the transitional institutions would this time be set -- be installed or established on the 25th of March.  And the prime minister is asking the president to make himself available and carry out that activity as they had agreed.  

And on that day, on the 25th, the president showed up.  A number of political parties came, but the RPF did not attend. 
Q.	Now, we know that, on the last days of March 1994, the diplomatic corps had unanimously urged the RPF to agree to the admission of the CDR, since they had not fulfilled all of the requirements for participating in the transitional government.  Now, after that -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry.  I -- I don't mean to be rude.  I know Mr. Robinson hasn't finished his question.  But even at this stage the question -- I'm objecting to the question.  Mr. Robinson is -- is putting in evidence, through his question, fact that has not been established on the trial record.  So if he could find another way of getting at this issue. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, we have in evidence Exhibit D. NZ124, which is a communiqué from the diplomatic corps and the special representative of the Secretary General concerning admission of the CDR party into the transitional national institution.  Was that accepted by the RPF? 
A.	First of all, the RPF -- or, rather, the CDR got in touch with authorities, the prime minister and UNAMIR, and initiated intense diplomatic activities with a view to attempting to get into the transitional institutions.  And as the document of December 1993 showed, CDR wanted to have its place in the parliament and denounced all those allegations initially.  

And on the 28th of March, members of the diplomatic corps and consular corps accredited -- accredited to Kigali and the apostolic pro-nuncio -- and the representative of the Secretary General signed a communiqué, which is in this case as an exhibit, saying that the CDR would be allowed to take its seat as -- as soon as it agrees to sign the agreement.  So that was accepted, and everybody recommended that.  But later on RPF proved to be intransigent and refused. 
Q.	Now, on the 3rd of April 1994, where were you? 
A.	In Gisenyi. 
Q.	And did you participate in meetings between President Habyarimana and the special representative, Jacques Booh-Booh? 
A.	Yes.  I was there. 
Q.	And where did those meetings take place? 
A.	In fact, I would say they were not meetings, as such.  But Mr. Roger Booh-Booh had for a while asked to meet President Habyarimana after the failure to set up the institutions on that 25th of March.  

And on the 3rd of April, which was Easter day, the president had a plan to spend the weekend in his home in Gisenyi.  He told me that Mr. Booh-Booh had requested for an audience and asked me, therefore, to inform him that he was ready to receive him and that I could bring him to Gisenyi -- I could accompany him to Gisenyi.  

And we left the night before or the day before.  So on Sunday the 3rd, the first meeting which took place around noon -- we went to a private residence belonging to Mr. Alphonse Higaniro.  Higaniro is H-I-G-A-N-I-R-O; first name, Alphonse.  Higaniro was a former minister who had a residence near Lake Kivu where the brasserie du Rwanda or Rwanda brasserie was.  And that is where we met, and that is where we took lunch.  

And in the evening the president invited Mr. Booh-Booh to his private residence located near Lake Kivu also, at a place called Butotori.  And it is in the evening that there was dinner and that Mr. Booh-Booh said I was present there. 
Q.	And can you tell us what was discussed between President Habyarimana and the special representative of the Secretary General concerning the swearing-in of the transitional institutions.  
A.	These were not official meetings, as such.  They were informal meetings.  And during that period the topic of -- issue was the setting up of these transitional institutions.  And that is what Booh-Booh wanted to discuss with the president.  He wanted to ask the president to make an effort.  

It is true that the president was telling him, "You see, we agree to do such-and-such a thing on the 25th.  The RPF does not show up.  When it is not working well, you always come to the president; you don't go to the RPF."  That was a problem because everybody was aware that, if the installation ceremony or the swearing-in ceremony aborted, it was because of the intransigence of the RPF.  

And even if the president was ready, he was saying, "Every time there is a problem you do not go to see the person who is responsible for the problem.  You always come to see President Habyarimana; whereas, I have made all possible concessions."  

And it is within that context that the meeting was held.  But no decision was reached, as Mr. Booh-Booh said.  But President Habyarimana was always open to dialogue. 
Q.	At any time during those meetings, did you object to the position of President Habyarimana? 
A.	No.  We discussed during the session -- in fact, on the 3rd of April, everybody had in mind RPF's reaction to the solution that has been adopted to put an end to the stalemate.  That is the admission of the CDR.  

And RPF said no to the entire diplomatic corps.  And the diplomatic corps did not react.  Apparently, RPF was dictating everything.  The diplomatic corps could come together to put pressure on the president.  But when the RPF says no, they have to go back to see the president.  But everybody was preoccupied with that situation.  

And I saw that in the report of the government.  They said Mutsinzi -- I -- it is said that I had threatened the president.  I had not done so at any point.  In fact, I did not have the power to do that.  Somebody cannot invite you to his house and you start threatening him, worse still, a head of state.  If you threaten him, he will send you out.  So I believe that those people are just writing what they want to write.  We could -- to have an exchange, we could discuss.  I think that in this whole business of negotiation we had the impression that when there are negotiations people have the right to express themselves freely.  That is the democratic process.  

So when you present an idea and somebody thinks that you are against something -- whereas, in a discussion one should be open.  I see all of the time it is said that we were against the Arusha Accords.  That is not the case.  To criticise the Arusha Accords does not mean that we are against it.  In a democratic process we have to criticise.  Even laws have to be criticised, even major decisions.  So when it is said that you have criticised, it is as if we were not allowed to criticise.  

So, first of all, contrary to what was said, I did not threaten the president.  We had an exchange, and we realised that RPF's position in March and early April should have been criticised by the international community.  But nobody did so.  And they were forcing RPF to be more and more intransigent.  I will stop there for now, and we might perhaps have the opportunity to revisit this. 
Q.	On the 3rd of April 1994, did you want the transitional institutions to be installed? 
A.	That had always been our wish.  And since I am in the box, let me tell you now that when the president left he told Mr. Booh-Booh that when he -- that he had decided that he would solve that problem once and for all so that the country should be taken out of that stalemate.  So the goodwill was there. 
Q.	Was President Habyarimana going to be travelling after the 3rd of April? 
A.	Yes.  The president told us that -- before taking his trip to East Africa, he told us that he was going to Gbadolite.  Gbadolite is in Zaire.  At that time -- G-B-A-D-O-L-I-T-E.  That was the native place -- or native place of President Mobutu.  And he did go there on the 4th in the morning. 
Q.	What was his purpose in travelling there? 
A.	You see, I can only guess because he had been invited to a regional summit.  And I think he wanted to have a discussion with his Zairean counterparts.  But I am only guessing because a heads-of-state summit was going to take place.  But he never told me what he was going to do there. 
Q.	Now, during the day of the 6th of April, while the president was in Dar es Salaam, what were you doing? 
A.	In fact, on the 6th of April during the day, we held a brief meeting.  The R -- the MR -- MRND executive bureau together with the director of the cabinet of the president were involved in this meeting.  The director of the president's cabinet had informed us that we should make concrete proposals so that the institutions should be set up as soon as possible.  

We discussed the possibility of coming out of the stalemate.  And that meeting which we held enabled us to make proposals, proposals showing that -- showing what could be done.  We also made the last attempts to see whether we could come out of the stalemate. 

In our proposals we asked the director of -- of -- the director of cabinet to make them public.  But he could not make our proposals public before meeting the president.  And when we broke up, the director of the cabinet, Mr. Énoch Ruhigira -- Ruhigira, that is, R-U-H-I-G-I-R-A.  Énoch Ruhigira.  He was director of the president's cabinet.  

And on the said 6th of April after our meeting, he went to the airport to welcome the president.  And he intended to submit to him, that is, to the president, the outcome of our discussions in order to see how to set up the transition institutions.  In fact, Ruhigira himself, in the notes that he submitted to the 
Mucyo -- or Mutsinzi commission, stated that the president had asked him to make every effort for the transition institutions to be put in place during the week of the 8th.  

So when we broke up, I went to my house.  Karemera also went to his house as well as Mathieu.  And the director of the president's cabinet went to the airport. 
Q.	And as he flew from Dar es Salaam to Kigali, do you believe that President Habyarimana was truly ready to implement the Arusha Accords? 
A.	Irrespective of all that is said on President Habyarimana, personally, I am convinced that the president was sincere and he has always been sincere with himself. 
Q.	Now, I want to ask you:  During the period -- from the time you became secretary general of the MRND in July of 1993 until the 6th of April 1994, had you returned at all to Mukingo? 
A.	Which period are you referring to?  I did not clearly hear the period referred to. 
Q.	July 1993 until 6th April 1994.  
A.	Yes.  I went to Ruhengeri.  I went to Mukingo on specific occasions.  As I told you, in 1993 I did not move about often.  But -- first of all, between the 1st of January 1994 and the 6th of April 1994, contrary to Prosecution witnesses' allegations, according to which at the end of every month I was in Mukingo commune -- that information -- those allegations are false.  

At the end of the month of January 1994, the end of February 1994, as well as the end of March 1994, my movements are well documented.  I could tell you where I was during those three weekends so -- which Witness GAP testified to.  

For the year 1993 I went there but depending on specific circumstances.  I could mention the following:  After the signing of the Arusha Accords.  

The representative of our party in the transition institutions had to be designated.  The MRND national committee, in its meeting of 21 August 1993, decided that, amongst others, MRND representatives in parliament had to be designated by préfectoral committees.  

I was one of the MRND MPs, so I was elected by the Ruhengeri congress.  In order to be elected, I had to go to Ruhengeri because a congress had to take place in Ruhengeri.  So that is one example of an occasion when I went to Ruhengeri.  

I could give another example.  During the -- during wedding ceremonies or funeral ceremonies, I could travel.  So it was on specific occasions.  Now, if you ask me the specific dates, I will be unable to tell you that. 

The frequency -- depending on the security situation, I did not move often.  And as you know, political problems took up our time, and we were in Kigali.  
Q.	During that eight-month period that I referred to, can you give us an estimate of the number of times that you were in Mukingo.  
A.	That will be very difficult for me.  But I know that I attended the congress.  I know that I attended the wedding ceremony of a brother.  I know that I attended the funeral ceremony -- a funeral ceremony in the commune.  Sometimes I would say it may be three or four times.  But I cannot tell you exactly what I did on what day.  So these are the occasions or the dates that I -- the periods that I remember.  And I did not spend the night whenever I went there. 
Q.	Did you have a child with a woman by the name of Kiberwa? 
A.	Witness BTH testified that I -- I had a -- a child with a Tutsi woman and that I killed that child.  I think that is not true.  In 1994 -- in 1974, rather, when I was a student at the National University of Rwanda, indeed I had a friend, a Tutsi girlfriend.  She told me she had a child with a man.  I was a student.  After telling me she had a child with someone, she wanted us to get married.  But we did not get married.  

That woman had a daughter, and that daughter or girl -- since I did not marry her -- since I did not marry the Tutsi woman, the child grew up, and the child is still alive.  Today she's also married.  She's still around.  I know that at present she's in Rwanda in Gisenyi.  But people said that I had killed her.  I do not know why they said that. 

So it was in 1974 while I was still a student of the National University of Rwanda. 
Q.	And did you have a son named Ingabire with that woman? 
A.	No.  In fact, that woman initially had had -- or had an affair with a man who was called Nyagakenke.  I can give you the spelling:  N-Y-A-G-A-K-E-N-E -- N-K-E, Jean-Bosco.  This Jean-Bosco was a teacher, just like the woman referred to.  And he is the son of Ingabire.  Therefore, I do not know who -- where -- or why it was said that I had a child with this woman, a child called Ingabire.  That is not true. 
Q.	And did this woman live in Kigali with her children in 1994? 
A.	When I completed university, I was promoted director general.  Since that woman was a teacher and since I also got married -- at some point in time -- she requested me to take care of her child.  I sent the child to school, and I found work for that woman.  I found work for her in Kigali in a company where she could earn a little bit more in order to take care of her children.  

As you know, in my country the marriage regime is monogamy.  I couldn't say that I had a second woman if I did not get married officially -- if I did not marry officially.  Besides, our affair was during the period when I was a student.  

And when I became director general, I helped that woman to obtain a more lucrative job in Kigali.  That job was in a company.  And she was, therefore, able to educate her children.  The children also went to secondary school.  The daughter completed her secondary school.  She started working.  The woman, therefore, lived in Kigali with her children.  

But when I married in 1976, 1977, I stopped seeing her because once you are married you are committed to your wife.  I had abandoned my status as a bachelor.  I was no longer a -- a student.  I was somebody -- I will -- rather, I was an official in the administrative establishment. 
Q.	Did you have any way of knowing that Ingabire was in Mukingo commune on the 7th of April 1994? 
A.	First of all, I did not know that.  And secondly, I could never have had the intention of killing a child because the child's mother is Tutsi.  No.  I could not have such intention.  It is unfortunate that some witnesses made such allegations.  

And this -- and what hurts me a great deal is that Witness BTH -- B -- Witness BTH's mother was Tutsi, as he himself said.  So how come it -- that I would have a child and decide to kill the child because the mother -- the child's mother is Tutsi.  Ingabire was not my child.  But I cannot decide to kill a child simply because the child's mother is Tutsi.  

Secondly, why did BTH himself, who survived those events, according to him -- why was he not killed?  Whatever be the case, BTH also acknowledged that they made up many stories.  They did not receive any instructions to kill those they killed.  In any case, I was never in contact with those people. 
Q.	After the 6th of April 1994, did you make any telephone calls to the Mukingo commune office? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Did you make any telephone calls to the Busengo sous-préfecture after the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	Never. 
Q.	Did you intervene at all in the arrest of anyone who had been part of the attack on the court of appeal on the 14th of April 1994? 
A.	Never.  It is here that I heard about that event through the Prosecution.  But never -- I never intervened for anyone. 
Q.	Do you know of any membership cards of the Interahamwe that were issued in Mukingo commune? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did you ever meet Colonel Anatole Nsengiyumva at the Bikini Tam-Tam hotel in Gisenyi? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Were you a -- ever a member of the Friends of the Alliance or Dragons or Abakozi? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Did you ever make a broadcast on RTLM in which you said that the Tutsis had killed their benefactor, President Habyarimana? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Did you ever consult with Préfet Renzaho on the 7th of April concerning the setting up of roadblocks in Kigali? 
A.	Never. 
Q.	What is the Akazu? 
A.	Akazu is a concept or a notion invented by opposition political parties.  And that term referred to the nuclear or immediate family of President Habyarimana.  If my memory serves me right, that term was invented in November (sic) 1972 during -- 1992 in order to discredit the president's family, because Akazu, according to its inventors, was a small house or hut wherein people who had leprosy lived.  And they organised a meeting at the Umuganda stadium.  They -- according to those who invented the term -- or, rather, they -- they fabricated a hut and burnt it at Nyamirambo stadium.  And they said that they had burnt the Akazu.  

So, in brief, at the beginning that is what it meant.  It referred to the immediate family of the president. 
Q.	And were you part of any kind of clique around the president, who had the idea of trying to exterminate Tutsis? 
A.	No.  First of all, the Tutsi -- rather, the president never had the idea of exterminating the Tutsi, contrary to what is said.  If there was anyone who was a friend of the Tutsi, it was -- that was President Habyarimana.  And I am saying so in full awareness of the situation.  And if you want us to come back to this, I would go into more concrete details.  So that information is wrong, very wrong.  

Secondly, as I told you, reference was made to the president's nuclear or immediate family by the term Akazu.  And as you know, I am not a member of Hab -- Habyarimana's president (sic).  But later on people wanted to associate the Akazu with the people of Gish -- Gisenyu (sic) and, first of all, Bushiru area, B-U-S-H-I-R-U.  

Then they extended the term to all the people of the Gisenyi préfecture.  Thereafter, they extended the meaning of the term to include certain communes in Ruhengeri préfecture.  And after that, at some point in time, they included in the notion of Akazu the close collaborators of the president.  And you could find those collaborat -- collaborators in practically all the regions of Rwanda.  

You saw the diagram, what was referred to as the Akazu diagram prepared by a Prosecution witness called Michel Bagaragaza.  In that diagram you will find people who were seen here for the first time in UNDF.  It all depended on the objective to be obtained.  And anybody could be included in that sketch, depending on the objective, even those who had nothing to do with the president's family, even those who had nothing to do with political activities or administrative activities at the time, for example, priests and others.  

Therefore, the notion of Akazu was a changing notion.  And people could manipulate it depending on their designs.  They could manipulate the term depending on their objectives. 
Q.	Now, you've testified about ethnicity issues between Tutsi and Hutu and political issues between -- or among the political parties.  I want to ask you now about regional issues.  Was there regionalism in Rwanda, and how did that affect people in politics and in the country? 
A.	Yes.  There were problems in Rwanda.  First of all -- well, after the Hutu-Tutsi problems, problems -- well, first, the Hutu-Tutsi problem is -- doesn't date back to 1959.  The Hutu-Tutsi problem dates to the period -- to colonial period, in fact, even the period of the monarchy.  In fact, that problem had been existing for about a hundred years.  It is a time-honoured problem.  

Now, the problems which occurred after the revolution exists, they were -- they -- they were noted during the revolution and (inaudible) of refugees.  But after the installation of the first republic, political power was dominated by préfectures, the préfectures of the centre and the south, in particular by the Gitarama préfecture.  

The Gitarama préfecture was the home préfecture of President Grégoire Kayibanda.  And that was the official beginning or birthplace of regionalism.  That happened around 1968.  During that period you would see that, out of about ten ministers, the -- the region of Gitarama alone had about six -- six ministers.  

It is also at that time that the problem of -- of people who were dismissed from the party came into being.  Therefore -- or, rather, these people who were dismissed from the party came more from the north.  More of them came from the north.  And the problem was seen as a regional problem, an ethnic (sic) problem between the north and the south.  

It happens that during that republic, the Kayibanda republic -- political power was concentrated mainly in the centre and the south, that is, from 1967, because between 1962 and 1963 (sic), there was no problem of regionalism.  Regionalism came into being later on.  But in the meantime, it happens that there were several or many soldiers who were employed during the first republic and who came from the north.  This could be explained by the deviations that happened during the first republic.  

This combined with the violence that occurred in 1972, '73 -- and led Habyarimana who was minister of defence to stage a coup d'état.  That problem -- or, rather, when President Habyarimana carried out a coup d'état, he restored what he called peace and national unity.  

But at some point and time, he was accused of favouring the Tutsi, so much so that around the 1980s his military colleagues, including Colonel Kanyarengwe, who later on became chairman of the RPF, or Major Théonel -- Théoneste Lezinda -- Kanyarengwe is K-A-N-Y-A-R-E-N-G-W-E, Alexis.  He was a colonel and minister of the interior.  Then Major Théoneste Lizinde.  Lizinde, L -- L-E-Z-I-N-D-A (sic), Théoneste.  He was the central chief of intelligence. 

So they severely criticised Habyarimana's policy, that his policy of national unity left out or forgot the positive contribution of the revolution to the Hutu population.  They accused him of going too far.  In 1980 these two officers attempted a coup d'état to put aside Habyarimana.  The coup d'état failed.  Kanyarengwe went into exile.  Lizinde later on was arrested and imprisoned.  And it is the RPF that liberated him on 23 January 1991.  And he joined the RPF.  So these are the offices -- officers who you will find in the second republic and who later on joined the RPF.  

But at some moment the Hutu-Tutsi problem seemed to have calmed down and came into being the problem of regionalism, which survived.  Habyarimana was accused of over-favouring his region.  This problem lasted.  And I must say that it even aggravated the problems that we experienced during the period of 1990, 1994, that is, the problems of war, because at some point in time, members of opposition parties or those who did not want to join Habyarimana's camp wanted to settle scores with him, so much so that they preferred the RPF to Habyarimana.  

So I am saying that alongside the Hutu-Tutsi problem, which seems to have died down during the period 1973 to 1990, there was the problem of regionalism, which started in 1968.  The problem was not eradicated either with the birth of the second republic.  I -- that was a brief summary because I do not want to take up the Court's time with all these political and social issues. 
Q.	In the early 1990s did you find yourself being called an extremist because you were from the north? 
A.	At the beginning of the '90s, it should be said that that was the beginning of multiparty politics.  And people wanted to get rid of the former regime by all means.  So there was a proliferation of newspapers, newspapers which attacked people.  They had to -- privileged targets.  And I was also attacked.  I was attacked seriously.  Journalists wrote whatever they wanted to write.  And as I said, they were just taking things out, but I think that is normal in a democracy and should be accepted. 
Q.	Now -- 
A.	But let me say that I am not extremist at all.  I am not an extremist at all.  People exaggerated actually. 
Q.	Now, when you went into exile on the 17th of July 1994, where did you go? 
A.	I went to the Democratic Republic of Congo, which used to be Zaire, and specifically to Goma. 
Q.	And how long did you remain in the country of Zaire? 
A.	I went to Zaire.  At one point in time, refugees were threatened.  I went to Kinshasa too.  But six months later, towards the end of 1994, I went to Cameroon.  But I didn't spend my time in Cameroon permanently.  I kept shuttling between Cameroon and Zaire. 
Q.	And did there come a time when you did move to Cameroon and take up a residence there? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	When was that? 
A.	I arrived towards the end of 1994, and I got my family to join me from Kinshasa in 1995. 
Q.	And did there come a time when your wife passed away? 
A.	I left them in Cameroon.  At one point in 1996, the Kigali government sent out arrest warrant.  I was informed.  So I left, leaving my family in Cameroon in March 1996.  I went back to Zaire and then to Benin.  And when my wife came to join me, she was sick, and she died. 
Q.	When did she die? 
A.	On the 10th of October 1997. 
Q.	And when were you arrested? 
A.	On the 5th of June 1998. 
Q.	And have you been in prison ever since? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	While you were in -- outside of Rwanda and before you were arrested, did you ever use any travel documents that were not in your real name? 
A.	Yes.  When we were in exile, I used travel documents, passports, fake passports for security reasons. 
Q.	Did you participate in political activities during the time you were in exile? 
A.	Yes.  On occasion we were thinking about our situation, the situation of Rwandans.  We would meet in Congo, in Zaire, in Bukavu, in Goma.  I was trying to see how we could get the international opinion informed on what was happening in Rwanda.  But we had a very small margin of manoeuvre because as refugees we faced all risks and hazards.  And contrary to what people think, being a refugee is not the best thing.  We -- you have it, but it's not what you would rather have. 
Q.	Did there come a time when you learned that an international tribunal had been created to try those believed responsible for the events in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes.  I got to know that.  In fact, in 1995 I had the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, the first copy.  So I was aware.  And that was an initiative which we were satisfied with. 
Q.	And since you were maintaining your innocence throughout this period, why didn't you surrender when you learned that the international tribunal wanted you? 
A.	Why I surrendered?  I was arrested. 
Q.	And my question was, why did you not surrender?  
A.	No.  Surrender while -- first of all, when I was in Cameroon, the first arrest warrant was issued by Kigali.  And when I learnt that it was Kigali, I said that we might as well be prosecuted by the people we were fighting against yesterday.  I had the information.  And I took off.  

So when I was in Benin, I was in -- also informed that -- that the international tribunal was looking for me.  I had the information.  And I told myself, "For how long I will be running?"  If it is international justice, I am ready to face it.  So they came and arrested me.  I knew I had to -- nothing to reproach myself with.  I was arrested.  

And when I was arrested, I asked that the charges I was going to face should be given to me.  I told -- I was told that I would receive it subsequently.  I asked for a copy of the arrest warrant.  They said there was none.  They said there was a letter from the Prosecutor stating that I should be arrested.  And I was arrested.  

But I knew that things would happen otherwise with international justice.  But I had already had some information on what was going on in -- in Arusha.  But I had no choice.  I could not continue going around and around.  Up to what point?  So I said that I was going to face this international justice so that I should be told what charges are brought against me, and then I will answer those charges.  And that what -- that is what I've been doing for 12 years. 
Q.	When you came to the Tribunal, did you plead not guilty? 
A.	Yes.  I entered a plea of not guilty, and that is what I maintain. 
Q.	Now, you sat next to me very patiently since 2003, listening to the parade of people who have come before this Tribunal accusing you of participating in genocide.  Is there anything else that you'd like to tell the Court before we conclude your direct examination? 
A.	Well, what I can say is quite simply that the charges against me were lies.  I think that since you met me in 2002 I told you -- I had been asked to tell you what I could say for you to defend me, and you put a number of questions to me, many of ques -- many questions, which I answered.  And I think that the answers I gave you from March 2002 up till today have remained the same up till this day.  

All I can tell the Chamber is that justice should be done in all fairness.  And I have confidence because my conscience is clear and I have nothing to reproach myself with. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Nzirorera.  

MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I have no further questions.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Robinson. 

Do any of the other Defence teams have any questions to put to Mr. Nzirorera?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
No.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
No, Mr. President.  I have no questions. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, you wanted to break his testimony at this stage?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I'm requesting that we allow Mr. Nzirorera to stand down and that we be allowed to call our next witness, Witness 34, and then to resume his testimony after the second witness, Léon Habyarimana, testifies.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nzirorera, as you have heard our discussion, that we are going to interrupt your testimony now so we can take two other witnesses.  And when their testimony has been concluded, you'll return for your cross-examination to commence.  So you may stand down now. 
THE WITNESS:
Understood, Mr. President.  I am obliged. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, we were thinking of taking an early luncheon recess now.  But perhaps your next witness could just be sworn in and you could take his personal particulars.  And then we will break and resume at 2 o'clock.  Would that be convenient?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  That's a good idea, Mr. President.  And while we're making that change, I -- has the Chamber been made aware of the Appeals Chamber decision with respect to that witness?  On Friday the Appeals Chamber granted our motion to vary the protective measures for that witness.  The witness had testified in the (By order of the Court, this name was extracted and kept under separate cover) case as a protected witness.  And we had made an application to the Appeals Chamber to vary those protective measures because the witness wants to testify openly in his true name.  

And so on Friday in the af -- late afternoon the Appeals Chamber granted that motion and request -- they essentially deferred to this Chamber, requesting that enquiries be made to confirm that the witness, in fact, does wish to testify openly and then giving this Chamber the discretion to allow him to testify.  

So it may be a good idea to take the luncheon recess early and have you review that decision.  Or else, if you just want to take my word for it, we can proceed by bringing in the witness in closed as a protected witness, and then one of us can establish from the witness whether he wishes to testify openly.  And if so, you can then make an order to allow him to be unprotected.  So however you wish to proceed. 
(Pages 21 to 36 by Tanya West)






























1220H 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, we think it might be reasonable to just take the luncheon recess early and resume at
2 o'clock.  Not that we doubt what you have said.  So we take our luncheon recess now. 
(Court recessed from 1220H to 1414H) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, the gentleman in front of you is Witness 34, known that way at this moment.  

Pursuant to the decision of the Appeals Chamber, the registrar has filed a submission in which the witness and victims' support section confirms that he has stated he wishes to testify in his true name.  And, therefore, the Appeals Chamber decision says that:  "Should the Trial Chamber be satisfied that the witness does in fact consent to testify under his own name in these proceedings, the Appeals Chamber finds that the protective measures can be varied to that extent."  

And so I would ask that you make a finding that you are satisfied that he does in fact consent to testify under his known name.  And there -- then we can introduce him to the Chamber under his true name. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We have read documents signed by you indicating that you consent to the variation of your protective measures for the purpose of testifying in the Karemera trial proceedings.  Do you confirm that you -- that that's your position?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I do.  However, since I arrived in Arusha I was made to sign some documents.  And I do not think that I should testify as a protected witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We have seen the documents that you have signed, which indicate that you consent to remove your protection for the purposes of testifying in this case.  And that is what I understand you have just confirmed.  
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.  And that is what I have just confirmed. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much. 

Yes.  We accordingly make the order varying the protective measures to permit this witness to testify in the case Prosecutor against Karemera as a non-protected witness. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Registrar, could you assist the witness to take the oath now. 
(Declaration made by Albert Lavie in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

You will now give your testimony by responding to questions put to you by the lawyers designated for that purpose.  And you'll respond, first of all, to counsel representing Joseph Nzirorera. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, Mr. Nimy will be conducting the examination of this witness.  And I would just simply like to state for the record that the witness is Albert Lavie, L-A-V-I-E.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

Mr. Nimy, you may -- you may proceed. 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, Your Honours, good afternoon. 
ALBERT LAVIE, 
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness Lavie. 
A.	Good afternoon.  Good afternoon, Counsel.

A.	No.  There is no document before me. 
Q.	Mr. Issa is bringing the document to you. 
A.	I have it now. 
Q.	Have you read through that document? 
A.	Yes, I have. 
Q.	The particulars contained therein, are they accurate? 
A.	Yes.  The details in the document are correct. 
Q.	Please sign and date the document, Mr. Witness.  The date of today is 24 May 2010. 
A.	I need a pen. 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I would apply for the document to be admitted into evidence under D. NZ829.  
	Thank you, Mr. President. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ829 admitted) 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Lavie. 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Please tell this Court about your overall educational background. 
A.	I went to primary school in Save and attended the first part of secondary school in Butare.  I attended the Butare CEFOTEC technical school for two years. 

Then I joined the Rwandan army, where I spent five years, from 1981 to 1986.  I was in the army in 1990.  I fought in the Mutare, having been called to battle.  And I was in the army till 1992 in that capacity. 

Then, from 1992 to 1994, I was a policeman at the Kigali-ville préfecture. 
Q.	In 1992 what was your exact occupation at the Kigali préfecture?  What was your job? 
A.	In 1992 I was a policeman at the préfectoral office.  I was in charge of the security of the conseiller of Biryogo, whose name was Amri Karekezi.  
Q.	Were you in charge of Amri Karekezi's security from 1992, is that what you said?  Was that your testimony? 
A.	No.  In 1992, I was an ordinary policeman in the préfectoral office and I had to work for the security of various property, like the banks and other offices, and I was often assigned to tax collection exercises as well and I continued to do that work till 1993. 
Q.	When then, and under what circumstances did you become -- or were you assigned to provide security for Mr. Karekezi? 
A.	It was in early 1994, February or March 1994 when some security problems arose, particularly when politicians were being attacked and some of them were even killed.  So at that time, the préfet of Kigali-ville, having noticed that the conseillers were under threat, particularly by the youth wing of some political parties, including the fact that he himself had been attacked by the Abakombozi of the
	PSD party.  So at that time the conseiller requested to be given a bodyguard.  And that is how I was appointed to that position and I went to work at his home to provide protection for him. 
Q.	Was that the first time you were meeting Mr. Karekezi?  Was that the first time you got to know him? 
A.	No.  We had known ourselves before, and I used to live in his secteur.  We met at football matches, and at a number of meetings of Muslims, and even during marriage ceremonies.  So we knew ourselves quite well. 
Q.	Were you the only one assigned to those duties? 
A.	There were two of us assigned to provide security for him.  And that was before the 6th of April.  With your leave, I can give you the name of the other policeman who was assigned to provide security for him. 
Q.	Please do. 
A.	The name is Selemani Nsengiyumva.  The conseiller had chosen us himself because we were Muslims, and he felt that if Muslims were assigned to provide security for him, because he trusted them and because they lived in his secteur, he would be at peace with such an arrangement. 
Q.	Did you work in shifts to provide security for Mr. Amri Karekezi?  That is, you would work one day and your colleague would work the next day, or how did you perform your duties? 
A.	We organised ourselves to spend the night together at Karekezi's home, then during the day one would be resting in the morning while the other rested in the afternoon.  But at night, both of us would be on duty at Mr. Karekezi's house. 
Q.	Mr. Lavie, where were you on the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	On the date you have mentioned, I was on duty at the residence of the Biryogo conseiller, 
	Mr. Amri Karekezi. 
Q.	How did you find out about the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	I learnt about the death the next day, in the morning.  During the night, between 8 p.m. and 8:30, we were watching a football match.  Then Karekezi got tired and went to bed so we continued to watch the match and then went out later on to continue with our duties till morning.  It is only then that I found out about the death of the president on my way home to clean up, have coffee, and then go to the préfectoral office in order to return my firearm. 

That morning, Selemani, my colleague, was the one who provided security for the conseiller, as he went to discharge some duties with tax collectors.  It is in those circumstances that I learnt about the death of President Habyarimana. 
Q.	Mr. Lavie, if we were to understand you properly, your testimony is that you learnt of it on the 
	7th of April; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  At about 6 o'clock -- 6:15 I had just arrived home.  It is the landlady of the house I was renting who gave me the information and she herself had just heard about the president's death on the radio.  Personally, I had not received the information. 
Q.	And what did you do when you heard that news? 
A.	Like all Rwandans, I was dismayed.  I understood that the death of President Habyarimana was going to lead to sad events.  I had a shower, took coffee, and I was getting ready to go to the préfectoral office.  But before leaving my house I spoke to a certain Ndayitabi, Suedi, who told me that Karekezi had just called me asking me to return home because Habyarimana had just died, and that we should talk in order to ensure security in the secteur. 
Q.	Mr. Lavie, can you spell the name you just mentioned. 
A.	Ndayitabi, Suedi.  
Q.	Yes.  Can you spell it. 
A.	Ndayitabi is spelt as follows, N-D-A-Y-I-T-A-B-I.  Suedi, S-U-E-D-I. 
Q.	Who was he, this Ndayitabi, Suedi?
A.	Ndayitabi was my neighbour.  Secondly, he is the one who represented the MRND youth in
	Biryogo secteur.  He was in charge of the MRND youth in Biryogo secteur. 
Q.	Very well.  We are still dealing with the 7th of April.  What happened next on that day?  
A.	After that information given to me by Ndayitabi, I just -- had just taken my coffee and I hurried to Karekezi's house.  He asked me whether I had heard of the president's death.  Immediately we heard gunshots in Kimihurura and he told me that the situation was very serious, that I should not leave him any longer.  He told me he was going to inform the préfet he was going to keep us in order to ensure his security.  But he said he was not able to contact the préfet.  I, therefore, stayed in Karekezi's house. 
Q.	If we understand you correctly, you no longer went out of that house throughout the day of 7 April; is that right? 
A.	That's right.  I no longer left Karekezi's house.  I was not able to return to my house.  I remained there in his house until the time when we went out to carry out some patrol work between 10 and 11 o'clock in order to see what the security situation was in our secteur.  Otherwise, I remained in his house throughout the day of 7 April.
Q.	And after the patrol, did you return to Karekezi's house, or did you go somewhere else? 
A.	After the patrol I, with a police officer and Karekezi, we returned to Karekezi's house to rest.  It was already midday.  We had lunch together.  And we didn't go out of the house any longer. 
Q.	So you stayed the night there.  Is that what you mean? 
A.	I told you that from that day on I stayed in his house day and night.  From the 7th of April to the
	4th of July 1994 I did not leave Karekezi's house.  I stayed with him until the day when the town was taken. 
Q.	Very well.  And the following day, the 8th of April, what did you do? 
A.	On the 8th of April, in the company of Selemani, Karekezi told us that the préfet had just had an announcement made on the radio and that he was asking the officials of Kigali town communes, as well as the conseiller of Kigali town, as well as police officers to attend a meeting which was to take place in the préfecture office of Kigali town.  On that day we went to the préfecture office of Kigali town.  We travelled or went there in Karekezi's vehicle.  I saw only one bourgmestre, the one of Nyarugenge, as well as the major, who was the commander of the police officers in Kigali town.  So on that date we went to the préfecture office of Kigali town. 
Q.	Is that where the meeting took place on the 8th of April 1994? 
A.	The meeting in question took place behind the préfecture office.  Those who know Kigali, behind the hotel called Hôtel du 5 juillet, which right now is called Jali Club, it is at that venue that we held that meeting.  And the meeting was short.  Participants were standing. 
Q.	What did Préfet Renzaho tell you during that meeting? 
A.	Following our arrival, he informed us that as we knew the president had just been assassinated and that following that assassination there were criminal acts committed here and there, he asked us to stop members of the population from committing criminal acts, that we should prevent them from killing and looting.  He also told us that since there were conseillers who had police officers who had to ensure their security, the said police officers had to stay with their respective conseillers and ensure security in their respective secteurs.  The other police officers went, or climbed into pickups and scoured the various secteurs, because there were acts of looting being committed.  

Karekezi, in particular, requested that police officers in his secteur -- in his secteur, if possible, should remain at his disposal.  His request was accepted.  We were two police officers.  And three other police officers were added to our number.  We were now five.  Later on we were 11 police officers.  The other police officers who were in Biryogo sec -- cellule, rather, also received instructions or orders to follow the instructions that Karekezi was going to give them. 
Q.	And Préfet Renzaho, did he at any point in time talk or say that Tutsis had to be killed? 
A.	Counsel, I never heard him say that.  He, rather, asked us to ensure the security of members of the local population.  He said that the Tutsis who were being killed in various cellules and secteurs were not the -- those who shot down the plane.  He told us that we had to ensure the security of all members of the population, including the Tutsis. 
Q.	Mr. Lavie, on the 7th of April 1994, did you meet Mr. Georges Rutaganda?  But first before you answer that question, do you know Mr. Georges Rutaganda? 
A.	I know Rutaganda.  Do you want me to elaborate?  In fact, if he were in this courtroom I will be able to identify him.  Do you want me to continue, Counsel?  

Where is he?  Well, he is not in this courtroom.  But I confirm that I know him very well. 
Q.	Mr. Lavie -- 
A.	He was a businessman.  I knew the location of his shop, which was near the Gakinjiro road.  I know that he moved about with Robert Kajuga.  I think he was one of the members of the MRND management committee or management team.  If I'm not mistaken, I believe that was the case. 
Q.	Well, did you see him on the 7th of April 1994? 
A.	I did not see him on that date.  I saw him the following day, on the 8th of April, and that was after the meeting which was held at the préfecture office.  

When we left the meeting, we followed Conseiller Mbyariyehe.  Karekezi went to his shop to buy certain things.  He bought a bag of rice and a bag of sugar.  We left Mbyariyehe's shop and stopped at Rutaganda's shop.  The police officers who were with us in the pickup said that they were thirsty.  They said that others had been given drinks.  It was very hot.  And Rutaganda, who followed our conversation, said that he had drinks, Carlsberg beer.  A certain Innocent was given a Carlsberg carton of beer.  It is in those circumstances that we came across Rutaganda.  

After meeting him, we continued on our way right up to Biryogo.  I confirm that I saw him on the 8th of April and not on the 7th of April, because on the 7th of April we did not go downtown. 
Q.	Very well.  Mr. Lavie, let us come back a while to the case of Amri Karekezi.  You said that you were assigned to ensure his security and that you were always with him from the time you were given that assignment right up to July; is that correct?  That is July 1994, of course. 
A.	Yes.  That is the case. 
Q.	Between the 6th of April and the time when you left Kigali, that is to say in July, how many times did Karekezi go to the Diplomat Hotel? 
A.	To my knowledge, he never went to the Diplomat Hotel, except perhaps before the death of
	President Habyarimana.  After the death of President Habyarimana, I accompanied him wherever he went, and I never saw him go to the Diplomat Hotel.  I, therefore, confirm that I never saw him go to the Diplomat Hotel.  And whenever he moved about I was with him. 
Q.	Mr. Lavie, since you were assigned to ensure Mr. Karekezi's security, how many times did you accompany him to meetings that took place in the préfecture office of Kigali town? 
A.	I remember having accompanied him three times when he went to the préfecture office of Kigali town to attend meetings convened by the préfet.  Apart from the three occasions when we were at the préfecture office to attend meetings, he used to go to the préfecture office but not to attend meetings, he went there for other reasons.  

But he would go there to solve other problems.  In any case, as concerns the number of times he went to the office of the -- the Kigali préfecture office for -- to attend the meetings, he went there, that is, he went to the préfecture office to attend meetings only three times. 
Q.	Mr. Lavie, if your recollection is right, can you specify the dates? 
A.	The first time was on the 8th.  The meeting which we ourselves -- well, we ourselves attended that meeting.  The second time, I believe, was the 12th.  And the third time was the 16th.  On the second and third times the meetings were held inside the buildings of Kigali préfecture office.  We accompanied him.  He entered the building of Kigali préfecture office.  That was on the 12th and the 16th. 
Q.	Witness Lavie, in the meeting of the 8th of April, apart from you, who was a participant at the said meeting, were there politicians in that meeting, that is, the meeting of the 8th -- 8th of April?
A.	I do not quite understand the politicians you are referring to.  But, nevertheless, I would like to tell you that that meeting was attended by police officers, conseillers, the bourgmestres and 
Major Nyamuhimba, commander of the police officers of the Kigali préfecture.  No politician was invited to attend that meeting. 
Q.	At the meeting of 12 April, were there politicians that you saw? 
A.	I did not see any politician at the meeting.  And if ever there were any politician attending that meeting, I would have seen them.  I therefore confirm that there was no politician at the said meeting.  Those who came to attend that meeting, we saw them coming in.  It was a meeting that had to deal with security matters.  And the préfet wanted to ask his close collaborators, conseillers, and the leaders of cellules to examine with him security issues. 

I and the other police officers who were in charge of the security of conseillers and bourgmestres were in the parking lot of Kigali town préfecture office.  Personally, I did not see any politician who came to attend that meeting. 
Q.	And at the meeting of 16 April 1994, did you see any politicians? 
A.	The meeting of 16 April 1994 resembled that of 12 April 1994.  The préfet had convened the same participants.  I did not see any politician at that meeting.  Karekezi told us that the préfet was very upset when he convened that meeting and he gave us a summary of the matters dealt with during that meeting.  I confirm that there was no politician at that meeting.  It was only bourgmestres and conseillers who attended the said meeting. 
(Pages 37 to 44 by Deirdre O'Mahony) 





















1500H 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Lavie, a witness testifying before this Court said that Mr. Nzirorera attended one of those meetings.  Did you ever see Nzirorera at any of those meetings? 
A.	Counsel, I never saw Nzirorera.  He's sitting next to you.  I know him very well.  If I had seen him in one of those meetings, I would have told you so.  He never attended any of those meetings.  

If my memory serves me right, political party leaders had their security guards, who were gendarmes.  If Nzirorera ever attended one of these meetings, I would have seen gendarmes who were in charge of the protection of political party leaders.  I would have seen them in the parking lot of 
Kigali préfectoral office.  In that parking lot you had only police officers who were in charge of the security of conseillers and bourgmestres.  

I therefore confirm that Nzirorera never attended any one of those meetings. 
Q.	And right up to 30 April 1994, you didn't go elsewhere, apart from Kigali? 
A.	In fact, in addition to myself and another police officer and a driver, a civilian driver, I accompanied his wife, Aisha Muganzacyaha, to her house in Nyanza.  I went there with the driver.  That was after a 
	hail of bombs was thrown on Kigali town.  That was after the 16th.  I was the one who went to Nyanza.  And I returned to Nyanza, I believe, on the 2nd of May to bring them back to Kigali.  He did not move out of Kigali.  

When there were problems concerning his family, I was the one he sent to solve those problems.  And as I just said, I went there twice.  Apart from those two occasions, I was always with him. 
Q.	You mean to say you were with him in Kigali? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  I told you that apart from myself and his driver, who could leave Kigali, he stayed in Kigali and when I returned I was also with him in Kigali.  I would also like to inform you that when I was not there on the spot he could not move about.  The police officers at his disposal were not disciplined and they would often abandon him.  

When I was not there he would stay with Selemani.  He was afraid of moving or travel -- moving about.  Whenever he wanted to travel, he would want me to be available in order to accompany him. 
Q.	Mr. Lavie, do you remember a meeting which may have taken place on the 30th of April 1994? 
MR. SENDZE:
Objection.  The witness has been asked what meetings he attended, and he has given that evidence on the record.  I think my learned friend is trying to prompt him to say something else, to add something to his evidence. 

BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Very well, Witness.  After the meeting on the 6th of April 1994 was there any other meeting that the person you were guarding attended? 
A.	Your Honours, whoever was in Kigali during that period -- it should be known that after the 6th of April the government fled from Kigali.  I think on the 16th of April the government had moved.  You had only the préfet who stayed back in the town.  Moreover, all leaders of political parties had fled the town.  There were only members and supporters of political parties who remained in the town.  The préfet himself lived in a sort of cave or on the ground.  He no longer worked in his office.  The town was heavily bombed.  The enemy sought to destroy RTLM radio.  So if my memory serves me right, there was no meeting after that date. 
Q.	Mr. Lavie, you had started talking about your trip or movement to Nyanza.  Would you want to add -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, from the Kinyarwanda booth there seems to be a technical problem.  The interpreter is not able to hear Counsel Nimy.  The Kinyarwanda booth cannot hear Mr. Nimy at all.  There are interferences and the Kinyarwanda booth is unable to hear Mr. Nimy.  
MR. NIMY:
That beats me. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We'll ask the registrar to assist. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, in the meantime, if I can enquire if the Kinyarwanda booth can hear me.  If so, we can change places with Mr. Nimy and continue. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, we can hear Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
If you wish, we can just change the place and continue. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Try it and see if that works. 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, from this position I have a better view of the witness, so much the better. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	So, Mr. Lavie, what I was asking you about, tell us again about this trip you made to Nyanza.  Have you understood me? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, I have understood you.  I had already talked about that trip when I said that with the deteriorating security situation in Kigali, as the city was shelled from all angles, particularly in 
	Biryogo secteur, Karekezi noticed that his family was in danger and therefore decided to send his family to his wife's parents' home.
He went to the préfectoral office to ask for a safe passage, so that he could address this issue using a minibus that would take his family to that location.  So he gave me a driver and we took the members of his family to Nyanza.  I dropped his family off at the home of the parents of his wife.  And the driver and myself returned to Karekezi's residence.  At around 3 p.m. we were already back in Biryogo. 
Q.	Did Mr. Karekezi travel with you on that trip? 
A.	No, I think I have already said that it was only myself, the driver, his wife, Aisha, and the children who travelled.  Karekezi himself remained at his residence, as well as his oldest son, Majid.  Only his daughters travelled. 
Q.	If I recall correctly this was in the month of May, correct? 
A.	No, this trip was done in mid-April.  However, in May I returned to Nyanza to bring back his family to Kigali, because in fact the security problems had now shifted to Nyanza.  Karekezi's brother-in-law called him in Biryogo to inform him that his area had come under attack and that people were wondering whether his children were Hutu or Tutsi.

Karekezi then told his father-in-law that he would be sending me to collect his family and bring them back to Kigali.  If my memory serves me properly, on the 2nd of May I went to Nyanza to bring back members of Karekezi's family to Kigali. 
Q.	Very well.  Now, Mr. Lavie, Mr. Witness Lavie, what about the month of June, did you again travel in June with Karekezi? 
A.	Later on in the month of May, in mid-May, I travelled, but not with Karekezi.  I travelled with those very children and the driver, but we did not go to Nyanza.  We went to Bugarama at 
	John Yussuf Munyakazi's place.  And I travelled alone with the driver, as well as the second wife of Karekezi, whose name was Hamisa.  The first wife's name -- the first wife, rather, remained in Nyanza.  And it was only Karekezi's children who had left Nyanza to travel to Kigali.  

So on that trip it was the driver and myself who travelled to Bugarama.  It took us two days and then we returned to Kigali.  That was the trip that I made after the trip to Nyanza in May. 
Q.	But my question to you was in relation to the month of June.  
A.	Oh.  Well, in June Karekezi's children were already in Bugarama and Karekezi asked for authorisation from the préfecture to go visit his children and he was given a safe conduit or safe passage to travel.  And we bought some foodstuff and supplies, like sugar, which would be needed.  So we travelled through Gitarama.  

When we got to Gikongoro we ran into a roadblock that was manned by gendarmes and the major who was in charge of that roadblock told us that he had received orders to stop people going to Cyangugu.  So we stopped at that roadblock and spent the night there.  

The next day in the morning Karekezi begged the major to allow him to continue on the journey, but the gendarme refused categorically.  And so the supplies that we had bought were given to Aisha, who was in Muganza.  And so what we did was to off-load our vehicle in Nyanza and then to return to Kigali after we had been given something to eat.  

So that was the -- another trip in an attempt to go to Cyangugu.  But we stopped at Gikongoro, for the reasons I have already mentioned, and returned to Kigali. 
Q.	Mr. Lavie, after the 6th of April -- did you and Karekezi ever go to Cyangugu after the 6th April 1994? 
A.	No, never.  However, I think I have already told you that I travelled to Cyangugu alone with the children, and I was able to make it to Cyangugu.  But when we attempted to do so with Karekezi, we were not able to make it to Cyangugu.  So in a nutshell, Karekezi never went to Cyangugu. 
Q.	Before you left Kigali to go into exile, did Karekezi travel to Gisenyi? 
A.	No, never.  If he had travelled to that location, he would not have gone alone without me.  We went through Gisenyi only once when the town was captured. 
Q.	When did you arrive in Gisenyi on your way into exile? 
A.	I think it took us two days to travel.  We left on the 4th and arrived on the 6th July.  We stopped at one of Karekezi's friend's house who was known as Hadji Haruna. 
Q.	Where were you?  Where did you stay while in Gisenyi? 
A.	We stayed at Hadji Haruna's house.  While Karekezi occupied the main house, we had pitched a tent in the courtyard of that house -- of that compound and stayed in it until we were told that Gisenyi was about to be captured.  And that is when we moved to Zaire. 
Q.	What were Karekezi's activities?  Or what did you do while you were in Gisenyi? 
A.	When we arrived in Gisenyi, we noticed that the situation was not good.  Karekezi did not like going out, so he sent people to look for someone to buy his vehicle, the vehicle which he had taken to Gisenyi.  So these agents were able to contact some Zaireans who were interested in the vehicles which he had brought from Kigali.  So while in Gisenyi he was selling the vehicles he had brought from Kigali. 
Q.	Did he have any contact with political authorities or with members of the interim government in Gisenyi? 
A.	No, Counsel.  If there had been any such contacts at Hadji Haruna's house, I would have been aware of them.  I would have noticed them.  I never saw a politician or a military officer or a minister come to that residence.  And Karekezi never left Hadji Haruna's residence.  All clients who were interested in the vehicles he was selling had to come to that residence to buy those vehicles and to take them away.  We ourselves did not move about.  We remained at that location.  

When we learnt that Gisenyi town was about to be captured and that it could be captured at any time we were set to leave the country at any time, even at very short notice. 
Q.	It has been said before this Trial Chamber that Karekezi met Mr. Ngirumpatse in Gisenyi; is that correct? 
A.	No.  Where would they have met?  I did not see them.  I think that the witness who made such an allegation lied. 
Q.	Mr. Lavie, a few moments ago I put a question to you about meetings at the PVK.  I talked about the 30th of April, because a witness appearing before this Trial Chamber testified that he saw Nzirorera at a meeting with Préfet Renzaho on that date; is that correct? 
MR. SENDZE:
Objection, please.  My learned friend knows that there's no basis on which he is asking this question.  I have made the objection before and I think he's going back to the issue.  

And I'd like the Bench to rule that he cannot ask this question to the witness. 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, the indictment -- Nzirorera's indictment refers to -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nimy, this is examination-in-chief.  You cannot lead the question -- you cannot lead the witness. 
MR. NIMY:
Very well.  

Obliged, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, given that you accompanied Mr. Karekezi to every place he went in April --
A.	Yes. 
Q.	-- did you accompany him to any meeting on the 30th of April? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nimy, we have to direct that this question be not put to the witness, and that he cannot answer it.  

It should be unnecessary for us to make this ruling. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the French booth did not get your last statement. 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I will rephrase the question. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Witness Lavie, after the 16th of April was there any other meeting at the PVK? 
MR. SENDZE:
I still object.  The witness has testified to the meetings he attended, so I still object to this question. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We'll hear the witness's answer. 

BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, could you answer that question? 
A.	As the Prosecutor has stated, I have already told you that, as far as I can remember, there were three meetings at the PVK.  

Apart from those meetings, I'm not aware of any other meetings that may have taken place at the PVK to which we would have been invited.  So that must be a meeting that I am not aware of.  So I'm not aware of any such meetings.  If any witness has made any allegation about such a meeting, then that witness must simply have been lying.  

Counsel, I have told you about the atmosphere in Kigali at the time, and this applied either to leaders or politicians, because they had all fled from Kigali town.  Some refugees coming from Nyacyonga had wanted to enter the city.  And so the conseiller and the préfet were overwhelmed by these refugee problems.  There was general chaos.  There were too many people in the various parking lots in a number of offices, and some refugees eventually occupied some of the offices of the préfecture.  

So I do not know whether you are referring to a meeting of refugees who were gathered at the préfectoral office.  If you're talking about an ordinary meeting of leaders of authority or politicians, there was no such meeting.  And if anybody had testified to any meeting of that type, that person must have lied. 
Q.	Mr. Witness Lavie, after the death of President Habyarimana what was Mr. Karekezi's attitude or behaviour towards Tutsis as far as you could notice, given that you were with him all the time? 
A.	After the death of Habyarimana, many people -- many people's attitudes and behaviours changed.  

But I must say, that it was as if Karekezi used to double speak, because he knew the ethnicity and political leaning of all his subjects.  He knew who was a member of the RPF and who was a member of the MDR.  He knew all the people under his administration.  So when President Habyarimana died and some people came to visit him on the 7th of April, he told them that President Habyarimana's death had to be avenged and that he knew those against whom that revenge or that vengeance should be directed because they were accomplices of Inkotanyi.  

So they started to track these people down.  He had a list of those people who he quarrelled with either at wedding ceremonies or in other circumstances.  And I am saying that he had a list of those people.  

And I do not know whether I have provided a satisfactory answer to your question. 
Q.	Very well.  Thank you. 

MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, it is 3:30 p.m., and I don't know -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
How much more time do you need to complete your examination, Mr. Nimy?  
MR. NIMY:
About ten more minutes, Mr. President, about ten more minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I can see Ms. Hounkpatin smiling behind you.  But, Ms. Hounkpatin, maybe we can just take the 
ten minutes and finish this witness. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I did not quite understand.  Are you saying that we adjourn here or we continue for 
ten minutes?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, I was suggesting that it might be in everybody's best interest if you just allow Mr. Nimy to complete his examination now, and then we could take the adjournment.
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Yes, if he would stick strictly to the ten minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, he usually does. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
I trust him, Mr. President. 
MR. NIMY:
Well, Mr. President, you said it all. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, I hope you don't let me down now. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Well, Mr. Lavie, I have a last question for you:  Do you have any criminal record? 
A.	No, I do not have any problems with the Prosecutor.  I lived in Rwanda in 1994.  I went to Goma.  I returned to the country.  I have lived in Kigali and then I also travelled in January 2007.  

Well, some people often came to threaten me and to bother me and to put questions to me about Karekezi.  And every now and then, I would be called to the brigade.  And there was a time when I even spent a month in detention at the brigade, but the only reason being that I was Karekezi's bodyguard.  But nobody ever accused me of any crime.  And to this date I do not have any problems with the judiciary, with the courts, in Rwanda.  

And even all those who attempted to accuse me failed.  There were some problems at the 
Gacaca court level and I was asked by the Gacaca court to bring false charges against people, but I refused to do so.  So they called for Karekezi, Amri, who came to dispel all allegations against me when I was detained and I was released.  

So to this day I have never had any difficulty with the court system or the judiciary, in spite of some of the issues which I have just mentioned. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, have you ever been contacted to appear in Arusha to testify against any of the 
	accused persons detained here in Arusha? 
A.	Well, I left the country because of that type of problem.  Some people came from this Tribunal but did not want to disclose their identity.  They called me on my cell phone and asked me whether I had had any contact with Amri Karekezi.  They called me on my phone, but I never saw them.  And I have already explained this point in Kigali.  

It is not the first time that I am referring to this matter in this Tribunal.  That team wanted me to help Amri Karekezi to come and testify as a Prosecution witness against the former Rwandan leaders, former Rwandan soldiers.  They told me that Amri Karekezi was going to prepare me so that we would both come here together and testify for the Prosecution.

So the answer I can give to your question is that there was a team from Kigali which came and told me that if we came here to testify we would receive a thousand dollars.  We would be accommodated in a hotel and we will travel by air.  So they were going to send Karekezi to contact me and we would proceed accordingly.  I knew the consequences of any such contacts and I preferred to leave the country because I didn't want to be dragged into such a thing. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Lavie.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I am done with this witness.  

And I would like to ask for the witness to be authorised to greet Mr. Nzirorera. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Microphone not activated)
MR. NIMY:
Well, it is true, Mr. President.  I was thinking that maybe the Prosecutor would not have anything to say. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I won't ask him, but I will enquire though whether any other of the Defence counsel would wish to examine this witness.

The answer seems to be no.
Mr. Witness, we take our adjournment now until tomorrow.  And I shall advise you that during this or any other adjournment while you're a witness you're not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody, but we expect that your testimony will be completed tomorrow morning.
(Court adjourned at 1539H)
