P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning everybody.  

Madam Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MS. N'GUM:  
Thank you, Mr. President, Your Lordships.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session, today, Thursday the 19th of July 2007, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.

Thank you, Mr. President, Your Lordships.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Registrar.  

The appearances are the same.  

Mr. Prosecutor, do you have a witness?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I was waiting for Mr. Robinson to jump to his feet, Your Honour.  We do have a witness.  The witness is in the waiting room.  We are ready to proceed. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  I would like to make an oral motion with respect to the testimony of the next witness.  And it's a motion to exclude his testimony on the grounds that the Prosecutor cannot be allowed to present testimony which it knows to be perjured.  

And the basis for this motion is as follows:  On the 7th of June 1994, a radio broadcast was made in Rwanda, which we heard testimony about over the last few days through Witness FH.  And on that broadcast Witness FH and the next witness both addressed matters of security and encouraged the population to cooperate with the government.  I think you will remember the substance of that tape.  

Now, in the testimony that this Witness QBG had given in the trial of Casimir Bizimungu, he denied being interviewed by that journalist.  The tape was played for him and he said that that was not his voice and the content was not his words and he swore under oath that, in fact, he was hiding in another place at the time and he was not in Gitarama.  And that testimony can be found -- the transcript of the 11th of April 2005, at pages 55, 81 and 82.  And he was unequivocal about that.

After he gave that testimony under oath, the Defence asked that voice exemplars be taken and experts be appointed to determine whether or not that was the voice of this witness.  And the Prosecutor sent a memorandum to those lawyers, in which they said that the Prosecutor admits that the voice attributed to this witness in that tape was that, in fact, of the witness.  And again that was a memorandum of the 8th of August 2005 from Prosecutor Paul Ng'arua to lawyer Ben Gumpert.  

And, again, in another filing with the Trial Chamber entitled "Prosecutor's response to Prosper Mugiraneza's application for (unintelligible) or other appropriate relief", which was filed on the 8th of May 2006.  The Prosecutor said that it admits that the voice on the audio tape recording was actually that of Witness QBG and that the words attributed to him were, in fact, uttered by him.  Now, that's the facts.  

The law -- we can start with Prosecutors' Regulation number 2 here at the ICTR.  And that requires that all Prosecutors at the ICTR demonstrate respect and kinder before the Tribunal and not knowingly make an incorrect statement of material fact to the Tribunal or offer evidence which the Prosecution counsel knows to be incorrect or false.  

The code of professional responsibility for lawyers in New York, of which Mr. Webster is a member of the bar, provides that a lawyer should not knowingly use perjured testimony or false evidence.  

And, indeed, the United States Supreme Court has held that a conviction obtained by the knowing use of perjured testimony is fundamentally unfair and must be set aside if there's any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have effected the judgement.  And I'm referring to a case called the United States versus AGURS, which is found at 427 US Supreme Court Report, page 97, from 1959.  

And the -- and another United States court has said that even false testimony which may -- impeaches a witness' credibility may require a new trial.  

And so given the factual situation here where the Prosecutor knows that his witness has committed perjury and, in fact, has admitted it and is about to commit perjury again -- I'm asking the Trial Chamber to exclude the testimony of this witness.  

I want to also emphasise that we consider that the use of perjured testimony in this Tribunal is a major problem.  And we believe it will be a major stain on the legacy of this Tribunal when facts come to light, that many witnesses who have come here from Rwanda have simply perjured themselves.  There's no other polite way to say it.  And we believe that the Trial Chamber so far has been too lenient and too forgiving of testimony which has been shown to be false and in refusing to even mount investigations for false testimony.  But now we have an opportunity for the Trial Chamber to prevent perjury, rather than tolerate it.  And we ask you to take advantage of that opportunity and to exclude the testimony of Witness QBG.  Thank you.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Lordships.  Good morning, everyone.  

Following what has been put forward by my learned friend, Mr. Peter Robinson, on behalf of Karemera's team, I should like as vigorously as possible to support the arguments we've heard.  Mr. Robinson has itemised events that are incontrovertible, untrue and prudent.  I think, Mr. President, there's a problem of translation.  I think counsel is asking if -- is there a problem of translation. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are hearing an English version of what you're saying.  I'm not certain of what the problem --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The English booth has no problem.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Someone mentioned the possibility of a problem.  If there isn't any, I'm sorry, and I beg your forgiveness and for having interrupted my argument.  My apologies.  

Now, Mr. President, I was saying, that what has been said by my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, is well argued and well supported by the facts that -- the incontrovertible facts.  So it is now, I think, up to the Honourable Bench to draw the immediate consequences naturally before the witness appears in this Trial Chamber.  What I mean by that is that the Trial Chamber should prevent -- forbid this witness appearing because the perjury committed is characteristic.  And as I was saying, at the outset, I should like you to fully grant the motion raised by Counsel Robinson and which our team, Mr. Édouard Karemera's team, fully espouses.  Thank you.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, on behalf of Mr. Ngirumpatse's Defence, I, of course, wish to fully associate us to the argument raised.  And while expressing with regret the fact that -- with the persistence we see with which the Prosecution obliges the Trial Chamber to hear witnesses which itself knows are not credible or which are in a state of perjury.  On several occasions we have observed that -- for months we have seen a parade of witnesses who have been stripped of their civic rights in their own country.  I pray the witnesses -- that the Prosecutor thinks to -- are not telling the truth, but that -- for any purpose that might be served to wish to present him to the Trial Chamber.  Now we have a witness who has manifestly committed perjury, is to come.  And I think that we must preserve the integrity of the proceedings and not allow such practice to continue.  And if the Trial Chamber grants the motion raised, it will contribute to a better service of justice -- administration of justice.  The Trial Chamber cannot be -- cannot submit to the presence of witnesses whose credibility is zero and allow a situation to continue that does not contribute to the service of justice -- a good administration of justice.  And we should not waste such -- our time in such a manner which is why we fully support the motion raised.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I guess I really should expect this litany of motions every time a witness testifies by now, but quite frankly it catches me by surprise.  Had I known we were going to argue this issue, I would have brought the jurisprudence with me.  I believe this Trial Chamber decided similar applications filed by Nzirorera just weeks ago in regard to Ahmed Mbonyunkiza and my recollection of the Court's reasoning does not comport with the way the motion has been argued by the Defence here.  It is not the Prosecution's contention that this witness perjured himself.  This Court has already held that inconsistencies within a witness' testimony, between his in-court testimony and prior witness statements does not necessarily mean that the witness has perjured himself.  The Court has also held that inconsistencies between one witness' testimony and another does not -- cannot simply be equated with perjury.  

On the facts, FH did testify both in this Court and in the Government II case.  And his testimony was that he was interviewed on a day or two after the 2nd of June and that he came -- he was apprised afterwards, that the interview he gave on the 2nd, or the 3rd, or the 4th of June was a rebroadcast -- or, broadcast for the first time on the 7th of June.  The testimony of QBG in the Government II case or in Bizimungu case, was that he was not present in Gitarama on the 7th of June.  From his perspective, the tape was false.  His basis for saying that, as he articulated in the Bizimungu case, was that he was not physically present in Gitarama on that date.  He had left the commune on the 5th.  So it would have been impossible for him to give an interview on the 7th.  The way the evidence had developed in the Bizimungu case was that the interview itself took place on the 7th and the witness had no recollection of having given an interview or made the comments that were attributed to him when he was questioned about this interview in the Bizimungu case.  It is not an issue of perjury, Your Honours; it is an issue of credibility.  This Court will have to hear this witness' testimony and make its own assessment.  

In the Bizimungu case, the Prosecution team conceded that the voice on the recording was that of QBG.  That is not a statement on behalf of the Prosecution or an acknowledgement of perjury.  The witness was asked if he recognised his voice, and in the Bizimungu case he said he did not.  He will be asked the same questions before this Tribunal -- before this Trial Chamber.  This Trial Chamber will be able to evaluate the witness' testimony and make its own assessment of whether he is to be believed or not.  It is not an issue of perjury.  
And my submission to the Chamber is that we should proceed with the witness' testimony and the Chamber can make its own assessment.  I'm well aware of my ethical obligations.  It is the contention of this Prosecution team that this is a credible witness, that he has not perjured himself and we do not expect his testimony to be -- we do not expect him to give perjured testimony in this Trial.  That completes my submission.  And I suggest that we simply move on.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if I could just reply briefly.  I hate -- I just hate to say this, but I just think what we heard from Mr. Webster is disgraceful.  The witness testified clearly that when he heard the tape in the Bizimungu case it was not his voice, the contents was not his words.  This is -- there is no way around this conflict by legal passing of this and that.  This witness heard the tape, he heard the voice, he heard the circumstances.  He lied.  And the Prosecutor admitted in that case that he did.  

Now, Mr. Webster wants to stick his head in the sand and pretend that that didn't happen and try to dodge and weave and obfuscate, but the fact is, if you look at the transcripts, you will see that it is clear that the witness has committed perjury.  And I think that the Trial Chamber -- if Mr. Webster won't do his duty, the Trial Chamber will have to do it for him.  Thank you.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I should also like that the Trial Chamber bear in mind, and I know you cannot forget it because it was only yesterday, it was a well-known broadcast -- radio broadcast with Witness FH, here before you, who confirmed that he had made that broadcast with QBG, that he cannot understand nor allow that QBG could deny the evidence.  He would -- he said he did not want to put himself in the others place, but he who had been there at that time, and made the broadcast with QBG, confirmed that he was indeed the author of the interview.  So, Mr. President, the Prosecutor cannot hear -- avoid their responsibility.  They cannot, in the same trial on two different days bring two different witnesses to the same events and who say two different things and ask you to consider that they are credible.  I know that you are convinced that QBG has committed that act of perjury, but I would ask you also when, in deliberating, before ruling, not to forget that passage in the witness -- in Witness FH's testimony, and FH and QBG being -- both being brought before you by one and the same Prosecutor here before you.  Thank you very much.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll take a few minutes to consider our decision in this matter.  The Court will rise. 
(Court recessed from 0930H to 1011H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have come to our decision.  

After considering quite carefully the submissions that have been made, we have concluded that we should not exclude the testimony of the witness for a number of reasons.  The particular issue to which attention was drawn is not material to the thrust of the testimony about which notice has been given that this witness will testify.  

There's also a logical leap to be made to conclude that because the witness has given false testimony in the past that that is not necessarily will happen when he testifies in our Trial Chamber.  And in any event, we think that this is a wrong state of the trial for us to make findings on the credibility of the witness, particularly in relation to matters which are important to establish the guilt or the innocence of the Accused persons.  

In these circumstances, we think we should hear the witness and we will evaluate his testimony as it is delivered and in relation to the other testimony that we have heard and we will continue to hear.  

So we will not exclude the -- the application is denied.  

You may call the witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
The witness is in the witness room.  I don't believe there is a WVSS attendant with him.  Perhaps Mr. Issa can assist by going and calling him.  But while we wait for him to get in, I must make one comment which is that this -- the motion that we just resolved to me seemed wasteful of this Court's time because this is the type of motion that could have been made on paper.  Mister -- counsel for Nzirorera, and the others, have made several motions for exclusion in the past.  This seems a much more worthwhile motion in relation to the others that have been filed.  And, to me, it is inexcusable that we should take this time to resolve something that could have been resolved before the witness was about to take the stand.  This has nothing to do with the strategy of cross-examination for the witness.  There would have been no prejudice to the Defence to make this motion yesterday, or at least put us on notice because I could have had the decisions from this Chamber from just several weeks ago to resolve the issue more expeditiously.  We are proceeding.  We are ready to proceed.  But I think it is unfortunate and we should approach this differently the next time around.  
(Witness entered courtroom)  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, it may assist if I make a comment before we get started.  This witness was identified to us as QBG, has expressed an interest in dispensing with his protective measures and would like to testify under his own name.  So the Court can make that initial inquiry and modify the protective order accordingly, and that would relieve Mr. Robinson of his tension to make that motion of his own accord. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We thank you for giving evidence before this Tribunal.  As a preliminary matter, you have been the beneficiary of a protection order.  The -- an important element of that has been to protect your identity from being revealed to the public.  It has been represented by the Prosecutor that you have expressed an intention or desire to waive the protection order that has been made in your favour and to testify under your name.  

I would like to inquire whether you understand the significance of that and that is your position.  
THE WITNESS:
That is perfect, Mr. President.  

That is the case.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the microphone of the Bench is on.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry, let me anticipate the Court's concern.  Our request is usually that only the non-disclosure of his identity is to be waived in the protection order, so the other aspects of the order should be maintained, which is the request that Defence contact WVSS if they seek to get in contact with the witness and members of his family.  And the other aspects of the protective order should remain in tact.  But as concerns his identity, he's waived protection of his identity.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Court orders that the protection order in favour of this witness be modified so that his identity can be revealed by having him testify under his real name in our trial and that this testimony be accessible to the public.  

Now, Mr. Witness, as another preliminary, before you testify, you're required to take an oath or make a solemn declaration that you'll tell the truth during your testimony.  And the registrar will now administer that to you. 
(Declaration made by Fidéle Uwizeye in Kinyarwanda) 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  
Now, Mr. Witness, you'll give your testimony by responding to the questions put to you by counsel designated for that purpose.  And you'll have to respond, first of all, to the Prosecutor who will now begin his examination in-chief.  
FIDÉLE UWIZEYE,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, (Kinyarwanda spoken).  Good morning, how are you?
A.	I am well.  
Q.	Would you begin by telling us your name and your current occupation, and then go on to tell us what your occupation was in April of 1994? 
A.	My name is Fidel Uwizeye.  I am a civil servant in the ministry of lands, tourism, forestry and mines.  I am director of the department of mines and geology.  In June (sic) 1994 -- in -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry.  
THE WITNESS:
-- in 1994, I was préfet of the -- of Gitarama préfecture. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, I don't think June was in it.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Witness, while you give your testimony I maybe referring to the spelling list to assist the Chamber and the parties with the spelling.  
MR. WEBSTER:
So I will indicate for everyone that his name is listed at number 83 on the list that was distributed earlier this morning.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Can you tell us when you were first appointed préfet of Gitarama?
A.	I was appointed préfet on the 3rd of July 1992.  
Q.	What political party did you belong to at the time? 
A.	At the time, I was a member of the MDR.
Q.	Mr. Witness, have you testified here at the ICTR before? 
A.	Yes, I have already testified twice before this Tribunal.  And today is the third time I come before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. 
Q.	Would you tell us what cases you testified in before please? 
A.	Firstly, I testified in ***********************.  He was the former bourgmestre of *****************.  And last year, I testified in the trial of the ministers; Mugenzi, Prosper, Bicamumpaka, and the former minister of health, doctor -- minister of health.  I think -- I remember his name was Casimir.  
Q.	When you testified in *****************, were you called by the Prosecution or by the Defence? 
A.	In that trial, when I arrived here, I didn't -- I did not understand for whom I was testifying.  When I arrived, I was informed that I was a Defence witness, rather.  
Q.	Do you recall the pseudonym that was assigned to you for that first trial, for *****************? 
A.	No, I do not recall.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'd like to indicate the pseudonym for the record.  I don't know if it's appropriate to do that in open court since there's still presumably a protective order.  Is it --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We cannot break that protective order.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Alright.  Okay.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
If it was -- if -- I don't want to (unintelligible). 
MR. WEBSTER:
Alright. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If there was a protection order, we still have to observe it.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Alright.  The Chamber will be able to ascertain the identity of this witness in ****************** from the disclosures that were made in this case.  So I will leave it at that.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you testified in the trial against the ministers, were you called by the Prosecution or the Defence?
A.	I've told you that, at the time, I was told it was the ICTR which wanted me to testify.  Many people came to see me.  And when I arrived in the *****************, I was informed that I was coming to testify in that trial without knowing for whom I was testifying.  Today I know what is my status, and last year also I knew what it was, but before in ****************, I did not know on what basis I was coming to testify.  
Q.	When you testified last year in the Bizimungu trial, were you called by the Prosecution or the Defence?
A.	I was a Prosecution witness.  And that had been explained to me.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, have you personally ever been charged with genocide, or prosecuted for any crimes that are alleged to have been committed during the period 1990 to 1994 by Rwandan authorities?  Were you ever accused of a crime of genocide, investigated, or prosecuted for the crimes of 1994 in Rwanda? 
A.	No, nor have -- neither have been accused, nor have I been prosecuted, nor have I been convicted of any crime committed in 1994.  I think I shall leave it at that.  
Q.	Have you ever been accused of any wrongdoing, prosecuted, arrested, investigated for any crime outside of the scope of genocide by Rwandese authorities? 
A.	Yes, that happened.  I was arrested once and accused of crimes connected with the security of the country.  I was accused of having been engaged in undermining the security of the country but, after investigations were carried out, it was discovered that I was innocent.  
Q.	Do you recall when that investigation or that arrest took place?  Do you recall the year or the month, please? 
A.	Yes, I do.  That was on the work -- the Labor Day, 1st of May 1998.  I was arrested when I was living at the national stadium.  I had just attended the Labor Day ceremonies.  
Q.	Was that before or after you had testified in *************** here in Arusha? 
A.	That occurred after I had appeared as a witness in ****************** here in Arusha.  
Q.	Were you detained as a result of that arrest in 1998?
A.	Yes, I was detained for three months in a military camp, the presidential guard camp.  Then I was moved to the Kimironko prison yard where I stayed for one and a half years.  That prison yard is located in Remera which is in Kigali town or city. 
Q.	So altogether you were detained for a period of one year and nine months; would that be accurate? 
A.	More or less, yes. 
Q.	And based on your previous response, I take it that there are no pending charges against you, and whatever charges were lodged in 1998 have either been dismissed or disposed of; is that accurate as well? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Alright.  Mr. Witness, before you travelled here to Arusha, the Office of the Prosecutor requested some sort of verification of this information from Rwandese authorities.  And I believe you were contacted and a form was generated, which you've seen, and which was disclosed to the parties and to the Trial Chamber coordinator.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I have an original copy of a document, which is dated the 9th of July 2007, which I would like to hand to Mr. Issa who can then display it to the Chamber and to the parties.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You intend to admit this into evidence?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
After that is done, it will be time to take our mid-morning recess.  
MR. WEBSTER:
That would be fine, Your Honour.  

If you can display it to the witness, Mr. Issa.  

BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, would it be accurate to state that your photograph and identifying information is contained on that document, and that the document establishes that there are no pending charges against you and no criminal disposition or convictions for you in Rwanda?  Would that be an accurate summary of what's contained in that Kinyarwanda document? 
A.	Absolutely. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'd offer that as the next Prosecution exhibit.  I did discuss this with the Defence.  I don't think there should be a problem with admitting it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted in evidence.
MR. WEBSTER:
Could we have the -- 
MR. MJUI:
P. 161.  
(Exhibit No. P. 161 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Issa.  

We take our mid-morning recess now. 
(Court recessed at 1040H)
(Pages 1 to 11 by Roxane Meena)
















(Court resumed at 1125H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster, you may continue.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you kindly begin by telling us if you know Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	Yes, I know him. 
Q.	Do you know what his status was in the MRND party in 1994? 
A.	Nzirorera was a member of the steering committee of the MRND, if I'm not mistaken.  He was the secretary general, if I'm not mistaken.  
Q.	Can you tell us if you were personally acquainted with him?  Did you know him personally or just in his official capacity?  
A.	I know him, but I don't know if he knows me.  
Q.	Well, in 1994, thinking back to that period, had you ever seen him face to face?  Had you ever been in the same room with him, for example? 
A.	No.  If my memory does not fail me, I did not meet him.  But the information I received was that he'd come to Gitarama in an armoured car -- a military armoured vehicle, and the people who saw him told me about it, but personally I do not recall having seen him. 
Q.	Do you know what he looks like?  In other words, if you put your -- 
A.	Yes, I know him.  I could identify him.  
Q.	And that is on the basis of what, Mr. Witness?  Can you explain to us how you would be able to recognise him on the basis of -- tell us what it is that would allow you to recognise him if you saw him in 1994? 
A.	It is very easy to know him.  He was a high authority in our country, one of the main leaders.  He was the minister of public works, energy and water.  We'd often see him on television, whether because of his party activities, especially when there were rallies, or even on the road.  A minister was not just anybody.  He was important.  People knew him.  So because of his office and because of his important role in his political party, it is easy to know the top figures in our country.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  What about Mathieu Ngirumpatse, do you know him? 
A.	Yes, I know him, too.  In the same context of political party activity, I know Mathieu Ngirumpatse and I can identify him without fail.  
Q.	Do you know what his status was in the MRND party in 1994? 
A.	Mathieu Ngirumpatse was party president or party chairman.  He was an authoritative figure in the party, and in 1994, he was even party chairman or president.  
Q.	Do you recall if he had also held positions -- official positions with any of the previous governments in Rwanda?  Can you tell us anything else about Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Yes, Mathieu Ngirumpatse has been an ambassador, and then appointed as minister in various successive ministries.  I might be mistaken, but I think that he was minister of justice at one point.  It's quite some time ago, and it is not easy for me to specify which ministerial posts he held, but he was chairman of the MRND.  He wasn't just an ordinary citizen.  He was someone very well known. 
Q.	Did you also see Mathieu Ngirumpatse on the television or in newspapers or in public -- publications?  Tell us how it was that you came to -- 
A.	Yes, of course.  In the context of the offices he held, whether his ministerial posts or in political party activities, in rallies that were broadcast over the radio or on television, one would see him very often.  Moreover, I saw him in 1994.  I saw him at Gitarama and I remember that well.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  All right.  One last question here.  Thinking about the period before April 1994, I'm not talking about the month of April, but before April 1994, had you ever seen Mathieu Ngirumpatse face to face?  
A.	Yes, I did see him.  
Q.	Could you estimate the number of times that you've actually seen him, in other words, not on the TV or in a newspaper but actually seen him in person, just approximately?  
A.	I saw him on several occasions.  When there were festivities or when there were political activities at the stadium, he'd be in the -- he'd be sitting with the top leaders in the place of honour, and I attended those celebrations, so I saw him frequently. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Moving on to Édouard Karemera, do you know him? 
A.	Yes, I know him, too.  In fact, I know him better than the others because he held a ministerial post for several years.  
Q.	Do you know if Édouard Karemera held any official position in the MRND party in 1994? 
A.	In -- at the time before '94 and in '94, he was vice-president -- national vice-president or national vice-chairman of the MRND, and at one point he was appointed a minister.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, have you ever been in the same room with Édouard Karemera prior to -- prior to April of 1994? 
A.	No, not before 1994, not in the same room.  I did not meet him like that before then.  
Q.	Well, could you explain to us how or why you would be able to recognise Édouard Karemera in 1994?  What were the other means by which you would be able to -- you became familiar with the way he looks? 
A.	Well, how can I put it?  I'd say that in 1994 he had -- his hair was beginning to go white.  He was well built, plumpish.  I don't think there's any special feature -- he's got any special feature.  He's a man much like any other. 
Q.	I thank you for that description, but let me ask you the question a different way.  Did you also see Édouard Karemera on the television or in the newspapers?  How did you personally became -- become familiar with his appearance?  How were you able to recognise him? 
A.	Back home we'd see public figures in the mass media.  Even ordinary peasants from the hills would know the figures of authority from rallies, on TV, all the top people, national authorities, top public figures were known.  And even today, they're all well known.  He's not very tall.  He's not terribly plump.  He's average.  His complexion is not too light, nor too dark.  I'd say he was -- his hair was beginning to go grey, not like the other public figures that I have described before. 
Q.	All right.  Mr. Witness, is there any doubt in your mind concerning your ability to recognise Édouard Karemera in 1994 when you put yourself in the frame of mind of 1994?  
A.	Yes, I would have recognised him in 1994 unfailingly, without fail.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Let's start to talk about the events of April 1994 now, and specifically the period between the 6th of April and the 11th of April 1994.  Can you tell us how you were informed about the death of President Habyarimana?  So starting on the 6th, or the night of the 6th and the early morning of the 7th of April, let's begin the narrative there.  
A.	I learned of the president's death over the phone -- on the phone.  One Nsengiyaremye, Dismas, who lived in Gitarama, who had sought refuge in Gitarama, called me by telephone and asked me if I was aware that the president's plane had crashed.  I told him no, that I did not know of it.  And he said, "You'd better follow the situation closely because someone just called me from Kigali."  

So I put the question to the local military commander, who is my direct neighbour, and he also was not aware of that, had not yet heard the news, but that he would seek further information.  And two or three minutes later, he confirmed the news to me, that, indeed, the president's plane had been shot down.  That is how I learned the news -- that is how I learned of the president's death. 
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.  For the record, Dismas Nsengiyaremye is number 50 on our spelling list. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, I take it you were at home in Gitarama at the time; is that correct?  
A.	I was in bed.  I was in bed when I received that telephone call. 
Q.	And this was the night of the 6th or on -- on the morning of the 7th?  Could you clarify that for us, please? 
A.	It was in the night at about 8 or 8:30 p.m., in the night of the 6th.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, correction from the Kinyarwanda booth:  It was between 8:30 p.m. and 9 p.m. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And can you tell us who Dismas Nsengiyaremye is?  What was his status in 1994? 
A.	In 1994, Dismas Nsengiyaremye was vice-chairman of the MDR and also our préfectoral chairman of the MDR but, at that time, did not occupy any public office.  He was in Gitarama.  He lived there.  He'd sought refuge there.  He had political problems.  
Q.	But this was the former prime minister of Rwanda in 1993; is that accurate?  He was formerly an official member of the government? 
A.	Yes, he was prime minister -- he was a minister from 1992 and prime minister of the transitional government.  It was a broad-based transitional government in which sat opposition parties and the former governing party.  It was a broad-based transitional government, BBTG, preparing the advent of another government based on the Arusha Accords.  And then he left that office. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell us what happened in your locality in the immediate aftermath of -- of this news?  In other words, when this information became generally known in your commune, what was -- what transpired?  What was happening in your locality? 
A.	Yes, everyone heard the news, thanks to Radio Rwanda and RTLM, which was broadcasting then.  It wasn't long before all Rwandans learnt of the news, so much so that by the 7th of April, everyone knew and in Gitarama everyone had learned of that news.  
Q.	In Gitarama, or at least in your locality, was there any immediate reaction by the population?  Tell us what you observed on the day of the 7th of April, if anything.  
A.	Nothing special, except that instructions came from Kigali, asking everyone -- ordering everyone to stay home, not to go to work.  So the result of that was that no one went to work.  But from the public safety, security point of view, nothing happened.  People were waiting to see what would transpire.  
Q.	Were you in contact with anyone from Kigali during that initial period?  We're still talking about the 7th of April.  
A.	Yes.  I was in contact with people by telephone.  Personally, I had acquaintances in Kigali and my family.  The trouble is that some of the members of my family were killed in the night of the 6th of April.  Many members of my family were killed.  My cousin and his 11 children, they lived in Kanombe, and they were slaughtered.  And I had a brother-in-law, my sister's husband, living just below the central bank, and he was killed with his children.  So we were in constant communication with the people in Kigali who were informing me that my relatives had been killed by the soldiers and the Interahamwe.  
Q.	All right.  But thinking about Gitarama now, did you have any concerns or apprehensions of violence in your locality in Gitarama on the 7th? 
A.	No.  I had no fear of what could happen there because people lived on good terms, but I was worried about what was happening in Kigali because there was killing in Kigali.  Those people I told you of were killed whilst the government was in place in Kigali and was doing nothing to stop the killing that was being perpetrated in Kigali, and I wonder whether, really, there wasn't some sort of intoxication or the -- an importation or transfer of that killing towards our préfecture, if those killings being perpetrated in Kigali préfecture might not one day come to my préfecture.  But in face of the way people -- the citizens lived on good terms in my préfecture, there was no killing, no roadblocks, I wasn't worried.  But I was worried by the situation that prevailed in Kigali. 
Q.	Well, you were contrasting social relations in Gitarama to Kigali in your last response.  Are you suggesting that there was no history of ethnic conflict in Gitarama, or would you like to clarify that for us a bit? 
A.	I was saying that until the 7th, which is the date you mentioned, in Gitarama there was no interethnic problem.  The war had been waging for years between the RPF and the RGF, the Rwandan government forces, but the people of Gitarama did not feel personally involved.  They didn't feel that it was a war between the citizens; it wasn't a civil war.  And that is why I tell you that, from my point of view, from the point of view of the office I held, I perceived no interethnic tension in my préfecture.  
Q.	Was the MRND strong in your préfecture in Gitarama? 
A.	No.  When I became préfet of Gitarama, the MRND was not very powerful there.  It had followers, there were party members and also Interahamwe in Gitarama, but in relation to the MDR party and the PSD party, the Interahamwe were not powerful, nor influential in that préfecture. 
Q.	Do you know the names of the MRND leaders in Gitarama or in your locality, in other words, the president of the MRND at the level of the préfecture or the commune, and are you familiar with any Interahamwe leaders in Gitarama?  And I'm talking about the period leading up to the 7th of April.  
A.	Yes.  They had such people.  All parties did, everywhere.  There would always be what you would call a core, a kernel, of leaders.  There was, at any rate, at least a committee for each party everywhere in all communes, and at préfectoral level, there also was a committee and, of course, also at national level.  That was true for the MRND that had structures at all levels, in all administrative units, and I knew people who were part of that structure of the MRND. 
Q.	Can you tell us who the president of the MRND in Gitarama préfecture was? 
A.	The MRND chairman in Gitarama was also the minister of youth, and his name was Callixte Nzabonimana. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I think everyone is already familiar with the spelling, but it's number 58 on the list we're working with today. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Aside from Callixte Nzabonimana, can you name any other influential MRND leaders?  And if you can think of any Interahamwe leaders that were well known in your locality, you can mention their names to us.  
A.	There was one Claver Kamana, who was a building contractor and very rich.  And there was always -- also Silas Kubwimana, who was also a building contractor.  And as concerns the Interahamwe, there was one Georges, the son of Esdras Mpamo, who had been bourgmestre of Masongo commune, his son was among the Interahamwe leaders at both national level and préfectoral level.  And there were others.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
In terms of our spelling, it's number 6 on the list for Claver Kamana, number 23 on the list for Silas Kubwimana, and number 28 on the list for Esdras Mpamo.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you start to tell us about what happened in your commune and what you were able to observe or learn about what was happening in the rest of the préfecture from the 6th of April, moving towards the 11th of April?  Give us a short account of what transpired during that period.  
A.	Well, as regards the unfurling of events, nothing of note, nothing very important happened on the 6th or the 7th.  I think -- I might be mistaken on the dates because these now are events that took place a long time ago, and you'll have to bear with me, forgive me, as regards precision in dates.  Well, on the 7th, I think I called a meeting of bourgmestres.  I used the telephone because there was a telephone line linking all communes, and we used solar energy to run those communications, that means of communication.  And I asked the bourgmestres to inform those who didn't have access to means of communication, and I sought to learn from the bourgmestres what the situation was in the commune.  And the bourgmestres informed me that peace reigned, public order reigned in their commune and that there was no trouble, disagreement between the citizens, nor signs of any preparations for such disturbances.  

And I asked the bourgmestres to ensure that peace and public safety and security was maintained, and we took several measures to that end.  First of all, to keep informed as to the relations between citizens on a running basis, constant basis, and to resist any ethnic mistrust that might arise resulting from the resumption of the war in Kigali préfecture and other parts of the country.  So they had to be wary of any gatherings, or to avoid gatherings or meetings that might incite the people to commit crimes, and avoid making lists.  There were a list -- names of people on an ethnic basis, and to resist and to be wary of any erection of roadblocks.  

And we decided, in the course of that meeting, that we should meet every two or three days.  And on the 9th -- I might be mistaken as to the date, as I've told you, but then we met again on the 9th.  I had asked them to come back two or three days later to reassess the situation -- to assess anew the situation in our préfecture.  And the bourgmestres informed me that the situation was good between our local citizens, but that people came from elsewhere, from Ruhengeri, from Ndusu commune and Kibuye, from Gakira commune in Kibuye.  Apparently, some people from Gakira were trying to perpetrate incursions into Gitarama.  

Moreover, there had been an incursion in Runda commune -- I was informed about it -- an incursion by a group of Interahamwe -- group of Interahamwe under a leader named Setiba, and they had come to loot in Ruyenzi to Bishenyi.  Bishenyi was below Ruyenzi.  And the following day, the attack led by Setiba returned, and they killed three people in Runda.  

After that attack, I asked the local military commander in Gitarama to take measures to intercept those assailants from Kigali, and we sent eight soldiers.  In fact, we did so as a response to the first attack.  And when the second attack came, with the assailants that came with several vehicles, were able to disperse the group of soldiers we'd sent and thus straining the military arrangements we'd made.  So you see, the assailants had begun to attack our préfecture from other préfectures, and so the situation began to evolve, but it wasn't yet critical.  

As regards Runda commune, I've mentioned these two memorable events.  I would also say that there were refugees who had begun to come in considerable numbers.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I'm going to ask you to glance in my direction every so often because I'll be able to signal to you with a wave of the hand when you need to slow down or when you need to pause a bit so that we can examine your evidence in -- in bits.  All right?  So just look at me every so often as you give your -- as you give your evidence.  
MR. WEBSTER:
For the record, Runda is number 62 on our list.  Setiba is number 71 on our list.  Some of the other spellings we'll just have to catch up with later.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  You've talked -- you've given us quite a bit.  Try to situate those events in time.  Was it towards the beginning of the week, towards the 7th of April, or towards the end of the period we're talking about?  And here I'd ask you to confine yourself to the 6th to the 11th.  So just briefly comment now on when these attacks took place in Runda and when you started to receive information from your bourgmestres about these various events. 
A.	The attacks at Runda occurred on the 8th and the 9th.  I might be mistaken with respect to the dates.  I might be mistaken about a particular day, but there were two consecutive attacks.  When the first attack occurred, we sent a group of soldiers to set up a roadblock and intercept the attackers who had come from Kigali.  I do recall we had sent some soldiers.  They had set up a roadblock.  However, on the 9th, there was a large-scale attack that occurred, and the assailants removed the roadblock, killed three people, and looted the Gihara diocese.  Gihara diocese was a Catholic diocese located in the mountainous part of that area.  

The next day, I buried members of my family who had been killed in Kigali.  I buried them at my own place.  There were a lot of them.  And on the 11th, I attended a meeting of the préfets in Kigali.  That meeting was attended by the president and the prime minister.  That was, as it were, my schedule during that period.  
Q.	All right.  Now, I'd like to direct your attention to the meetings that you mentioned with the bourgmestres.  How were those meetings called?  Let me withdraw that.  Tell us where those meetings took place and how many persons attended.  
A.	Those meetings took place at the préfectoral office.  We do have a meeting hall there on the ground floor.  Normally, those meetings would bring together sous-préfets and members of the préfecture.  I think there were six sous-préfets.  

Now, as for the bourgmestres, some weren't able to come to the meeting.  And the first meeting brought together a lot of bourgmestres, but at the second one -- the second meeting, it wasn't possible for some bourgmestres to be present.  When one considered these developments closely, some -- one would come to the conclusion that some of the bourgmestres were not listening to me.  Not too many, though.  They were, as we say in Kinyarwanda, dragging their feet.  But on the whole, the bourgmestres did respond to my invitation to attend those meetings.  
Q.	Okay.  With respect to the first meeting that you organised, how many of the -- first of all, tell us how many bourgmestres there are in Gitarama préfecture.  
A.	Seventeen.  
Q.	Do you know if all 17 attended that first meeting? 
A.	I think they did attend that first meeting. 
Q.	As a result of that first meeting, did you draw any conclusion about any bourgmestre that was resisting your instruction? 
A.	No.  I didn't draw any conclusions following the first meeting, but if you want me to talk about the second meeting, that is with respect to the bourgmestres who attended the meeting, well, I noticed that there was no problem.  They did report to me on the situation prevailing in their respective communes.  I had the impression that they were listening to me.  I had prescribed a series of measures so as to ensure that the security situation does not degenerate within their respective communes.  
Q.	Well, during the course of that second meeting -- or by the time we get to the second meeting in time, did you have any perception of any of the 17 bourgmestres being resistant to your instructions?  
A.	No.  Up until that date, I would say no.  When we held our meetings, I didn't notice any problem.  But there were about four bourgmestres in whose case I would say they were dragging their feet, as I said.  It would appear as if they had some other ideas or they had some other views, but they could not impose their views.  There was consensus among the bourgmestres.  And so let me repeat, there were about four bourgmestres who did not share the general view as expressed by the other bourgmestres, at least, in my opinion.  
Q.	Which four, if you could identify them by their commune and by their name, if you're able to?  
A.	Yes.  I could mention the case of the Ntongwe commune who was name was Charles Kagabo.  He had -- he behaved badly.  In 1993, I asked the minister of the interior in a report to replace him by some other bourgmestre.  I did so because he had identified or allied with Burundi refugees who were in a Burundi -- in a refugee camp in an area called Gisali.  He joined those refugees in setting up roadblocks to intercept Tutsis, to check their identity papers and to physically assault them.  It was difficult for us to put an end to his activities, and at some point in time, I asked that some 11 of those Burundi refugees be arrested.  And some of them were soldiers.  Because in those times, there were some 131 refugees, some of them were soldiers and were known to have been soldiers in their country. 
Q.	Thank you for that response.  Let's move on to the other three bourgmestres that you describe as dragging their feet.  We may get back to this story with Mr. Kagabo later, but for right now, what are the other three names that you mentioned? 
A.	There was another bourgmestre, the name was Mr. Ugirashebuja, who was a bourgmestre of Kigoma.  He also created problems.  There was a third one by the name Sixbert.  He was a bourgmestre of the Runda commune.  Again, that was a problem bourgmestre.  There was an another one, 
	Esdras Mpamo, who was also a problem, but he was dismissed from his office in 1993.  In actual fact, he had to go on retirement because he was an old man.  He was replaced by some other bourgmestre who was absolutely in order.  There was another bourgmestre who was a member of the MDR.  He was the bourgmestre of Murama.  He was a problem.  I believe his name was Jean-Damascene.  You can check on your list.  I don't remember his family name.  I think his first name was Jean-Damascene.  He was the bourgmestre of the Murama commune.  

So, those are the cases I can mention here.  There was a shifting or a change in the bourgmestres subsequently, but as for the bourgmestres who were against me, who appeared to have some other ideas, some other agenda, among them, those are the ones I can tell you about; I mean those that I have just mentioned. 
Q.	Okay.  Would that Jean-Damascene Rutiganda?  
A.	Yes, I am talking about the bourgmestre of the Murama commune.  Yes, that's Jean-Damascene Rutiganda, one of the youngest bourgmestres, by the way. 
Q.	And then you also mentioned a Mr. Sixbert who was the bourgmestre of Runda.  Would that be Sixbert Ndayambaje? 
A.	Absolutely, yes.  Ndayambaje, yes.
Q.	All right.  Mr. Witness, other than these two meetings with the bourgmestre -- bourgmestres, what other means were there for you to be informed about what was going on in your préfecture?  Did you receive information from other sources? 
A.	I had no other source of information.  There was some structure, some organ within the MDR.  I was a member of the MDR party.  You see, MDR party had committees at the communal level, and some members of such committees were on the alert, and they could get in touch with me and provide me with some information, either by phone or by coming to see me at the préfecture.  That wasn't an official source, something pre-established. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.  
THE WITNESS:
It was as if I was being informed, say, by a friend regarding some unfortunate events that might have occurred.  But on the whole, bourgmestres did provide me with information.  And when I was on a field trip, I could also be informed.  But again, to travel, to go to these communes, it would have been necessary to have heard or to have been informed that some unfortunate event might have occurred in the said commune.  It didn't necessarily have come to me through the bourgmestre.  I might have learnt of such events from other sources, and I can tell you that there were such cases.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right, Mr. Witness.  If we think about the entire period now, from the 7th of April to the 11th of April, during that period, did you become aware of any killings of Tutsi on the roadblocks or attacks within the population of Gitarama, generally speaking?  I'm not talking about the incursions from outside of the préfecture, but during that initial period from the 7th of April to the 11th of April, did you become aware of any attacks against the Tutsi population in your préfecture? 
A.	Oh, yes.  I did have such information.  I told you that during the second meeting, which was the very last in the course of my mandate as bourgmestre, we did engage in an exchange of information.  And the bourgmestre of Masongo, for instance, told me that people had come from the Bwakira commune in Kibuye to attack his commune at Masongo.  And he told me that members of the population had repulsed that attack.  I had actually asked the bourgmestres in my préfecture to resist, to intercept, and even to repulse any such attack.  They could use the communal policemen and members of the population where that was necessary.  I had a clear position, in other words, that no killings were to take place in my préfecture.  

I was told by Nyabikenke that there was an attack that had to be carried out by -- from Ndusu, what was then known as the Ruhengeri préfecture.  The bourgmestre of Kayenzi said that they -- people had crossed over from Nyabarongo.  They were coming from some commune whose name I have forgotten.  But in geographical terms, I can see where that commune is.  It is opposite that of Kayenzi.  Now, between those two communes, there is this Nyabarongo river.  There was an attempt to carry out an attack from there.  And as I told you, these attacks were carried out, for instance, in the Runda commune.  They were carried out by attackers led by someone bearing the name Setiba. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  But it seems, judging by your last response, you're still talking about attacks from outside the préfecture.  Am I accurate in that characterisation?  Okay.  You mentioned -- 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	-- going to a meeting in -- 
A.	That is correct.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	You mentioned going to a meeting in Kigali on the 11th of April.  Tell us how you were invited to that meeting and what you expected to accomplish at that meeting? 
A.	First of all, how I was invited -- how was I invited?  Actually, I wasn't invited.  However, the préfet of the Kibungo préfecture, his name was Ruzindana, called me on the phone in the morning of the 17th -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.
THE WITNESS:
-- at about 8 a.m., and he asked me as follows:  "Are you aware that préfets are being invited to a meeting in Kigali today?"  And I told him, "No, I'm not aware and no one has told me about it."  And then he told me, "Yet, there is a meeting."  

And so I told him, "Since I was not invited to the meeting, I won't be going there."  Well, then he told me, "Fidèle, listen, it would be better for you to go there because they say it is a meeting that will bring together all the préfets.  Even if you were not invited, we are not aware of the kind of political game that is being played here.  It is good for you to go so that you are not accused the next day for not having participated at the meeting, whereas you were aware."  

And so I called Kambanda by phone -- Kambanda was the prime minister -- and he provided me with that information.  And I told him, "It would appear there is a meeting scheduled for préfets, and I was not invited."  So he said, "Oh, you've not been invited?"  And I said, "No."  So he says, "Come."  

And then I called the préfet of the Butare préfecture.  He was a friend of mine.  And I learnt also that he was not aware of the holding of such a meeting.  And I told him what had happened, how I had been informed.  I called him and I said he should come and we go together to the meeting.  He accepted, rather, that he would come.  But then when I called him subsequently, he told me that he wasn't able to find someone to escort him, some bodyguards to go him, and he said he wasn't too sure about his safety and security, and therefore, he wouldn't be able to come to the meeting.  So I asked the local military commander to provide me with a military escort.  I think he gave me six soldiers to go with me, and I travelled to Kigali and I stayed at the Hôtel des Diplomates.  It is located opposite the Kigali hospital.  And that's where the meeting took place.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, could the witness be advised to go a bit slower for the interpreters?
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	Mr. Witness, glance at me again from time to time and take your responses just a bit slower, because everything you say has to be translated into French and English, and we all have to keep up with your testimony.  Okay?  So just keep glancing at me, and if I signal to you, then you need to slow down a bit. 

Now, tell us, you recounted your conversations with the préfet of Butare and the préfet of Kibungo.  Is there any reason why those are the two préfets that you were in contact with?  Did you have any particular association?  And keep your responses brief, Mr. Witness.  Just get straight to the point.  
A.	Yes.  There was some reason for our engaging in consultations, for being close, for being friends.  The first reason is that we all belonged to the opposition parties, and we did recognise the fact that we were members of the opposition, and we stood by our position as members of the opposition.  
Secondly, we had initiated -- or carried out several joint actions prior to the month of April 1994 with a view to reinforcing good governance and pursuing some good decisions that were carried out at a political level.  For instance, we did support the Arusha Peace Accords and their enforcements, whereas there were some others who did not want to these accords to be implemented.  

So these were matters that brought us together.  Some other factor that brought us together was, well, we were members of the opposition, but at the same time, persons involved in the management of the country within a government, and that made it necessary for us to work hand in hand, consult each other, carry out a joint analysis of the problems we might face.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I take note of the time.  We can stop here and I can pick up after lunch, if that's convenient. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, this is a convenient time to take our luncheon adjournment. 

Mr. Witness, I should indicate that during this or any other adjournment, while you are giving evidence, you are not discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
I do understand, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

We take the luncheon adjournment now.

BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, before we pick up with your narrative, I'd like to go through a very quick exercise, and I'm going to ask you to name the remaining communes in Gitarama.  You've already given us four names when you mentioned the four communes and the four bourgmestres who you described as dragging their feet when you met with them the second time.  Those four names that you mentioned previously were the commune of Murama, Runda, Kigoma, and Ntongwe.  So would you now be able to quickly give us the 13 other communes in Gitarama?  And if you remember the bourgmestres for those communes in April of 1994, just tell us who the -- who they were, all right?  
A.	*********************************************************************.  Musambira commune, led by 
	Justin -- Nyandwi, Justin.  Nyakabanda commune, led by Jean Pierre Rukiramacumu.  Nyabikenke, led by Anatole -- I don't remember his family name.  Kayenzi commune, led by --

Bulinga commune, by Martin.  Rutobwe, by Mugenzi (sic).  Kayenzi commune, led by -- I no longer remember his name.  Taba commune, led by Akayesu, Jean Paul.  Mugina commune, led by Callixte Ndagijimana.  Mukingi commune, led by Basile Nsabimana.  Masongo commune, led by Louis.  And Mushubati commune, which was led by Fulgence.  I forgot the bourgmestre of Kayenzi.  He spent only a brief period at that commune. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Witness, I have a list of 16 now.  There's one that we didn't mention, and that was Tambwe.  Does that ring a bell?  T-A-M-B-W-E.  
A.	Indeed.  I forgot that one.  The bourgmestre was Nathan Mugaga.  
Q.	And with respect -- I'm sorry -- with respect to Bulinga, would that be Martin Nsabimana? 
A.	Yeah -- yes.  Yes.  I think it is Martin Nsabimana. 
Q.	For Mushubati you gave --
A.	Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Fulgence.  Mushubati.  Yes, yes.  Niyonteze. 
Q.	For Nyabikenke you gave us the first name Anatole.  Would that be Anatole Karuganda? 
A.	Correct, yes.  

MR. WEBSTER:  
Just for the record, and for the Court, this is the same exercise we conducted with the previous witness.  I've checked all of the names that the witness himself mentioned.  Where there is no check, 
that's -- that would indicate that I led the witness to elicit the information.  But, otherwise, these are simply the witness's responses.  I'm assuming that this will make the exercise much easier at a later point in the witness's testimony.  And numbers 6, 9, 16, and 17 on the list, I've drawn a circle around the number, and that indicates the four communes or bourgmestres that the witness has described as dragging his feet.  There are no other indications that I've written on this document.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So Mr. Witness, just going back to the portion of your examination where you mentioned the four bourgmestres dragging their feet, were the words that you used, when you met with them the second time.  Tell us what you mean by dragging their feet.
A.	When I use the expression "dragging their feet," I was referring to the fact that even before 1994 -- I believe I did provide an example with respect to the bourgmestre of Ntongwe, Charles Kagabo, by name.  That is, his conduct with respect to the Burundi refugees in the Misago camp.  I suppose you understood me in that respect.  For instance, the Kigoma bourgmestre was someone who did not comply with my instructions, who didn't listen or harken to my orders; and, by the way, I would say that he hid a lot of things from me.  Real information was concealed by him, was hidden from me.  And sometimes when you were to cross-check after some time, you would notice that he had told you a lie, he had misled you.  In addition, these were people who didn't come to see me, to provide me with information.  They did not often come to the communal office.  For instance, they didn't come to report to me on events that occurred in their areas.  And when I had some other sources of information, I would ask them, and they would tell me, well, these events did not happen in our communes.  So there were people with whom it was difficult to fit in, people who could not be categorised, people who worked well, those who were working not well at all, not efficiently at all.  There were some who could be accused of administrative misconduct.  Very difficult people, hardly implementing my instructions.  I could give some other examples, particularly during this genocide period, if you so desire. 
Q.	Maybe we'll get to the examples later, Mr. Witness.  But my concern is that when you described the first meeting, you seem to suggest that there was a change in behaviour by the time we got to the second meeting, and here we're talking about that week in August -- excuse me -- in April, from the 7th to the 11th.  That was how I understood your response this morning.  Was that a misunderstanding on my part?  Was there no change of behaviour between the first meeting and the second meeting with respect to these four bourgmestres?  
A.	I believe you misunderstood me, or maybe I did not express myself clearly.  

Right up to the 11th, there weren't any problems, per se.  And during the meeting, I issued instructions to them.  And on the whole, those instructions were properly followed.  Just for purposes of illustration, right up to the 11th, throughout the Gitarama commune, there were no killings, at least among members of the Gitarama population.  And that meant, or indicated, that the bourgmestres had followed my instructions.  I had also asked them not to mount roadblocks.  This was not done.  This was not mounted.  And they came to the meetings that I summoned, with the exception of these four bourgmestres that I referred to.  And I spoke about them because they did not come to the second meeting.  In addition, some of those bourgmestres embarked on what can be called negative activities, adverse activities.  Maybe I'll be talking about them later on.  
Q.	All right.  But were there any negative activities before the 11th -- that's what I'm trying to find out -- with respect to these four bourgmestres? 
A.	None.  No reprehensible activity. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  All right.  You were beginning to tell us about the meeting in Kigali on the 11th of April, and you mentioned speaking directly to Prime Minister Kambanda on the telephone.  Was that the day before the meeting, or the day of the meeting, that you had this telephone conversation with the prime minister?  
A.	I did not quite understand your question, Prosecutor. 
Q.	I'm sorry.  You had mentioned talking on the telephone with Prime Minister Jean Kambanda, and you mentioned that you discussed the meeting that would be held in Kigali on the 11th of April.  I'm trying to understand when that telephone conversation took place.  
A.	On the 11th, in the morning, we spoke at about 8 a.m.  I'm the one who called him on the phone. 
Q.	Was that the first time that you had spoken with him since the crash of the president's plane?  
A.	Yes, that was the first time. 
Q.	When was it that you became aware that a new interim government had been assembled? 
A.	I told you that the Kibungo préfet called me on the phone to inform me that there was going to be a meeting to be held in Kigali.  He asked if I were informed -- I was informed, and if I had been invited.  And I told him I was not aware, and that I was also not invited. 
Q.	I'm not talking about the meeting, Mr. Witness.  We'll get to that.  I'm asking you, when did you first become aware that a new government, an interim government, had been assembled in Kigali?  
A.	I heard a communiqué over the radio.  And instructions, by the way, were issued along with the communiqué. 
Q.	Do you recall the date?  If you don't, it's not a problem.  But if you do, tell us.  
A.	I don't recall the date quite well, but as soon as the government was instituted, the news was broadcast.  Immediately after the new government was formed, it was spoken of. 
Q.	When you spoke to the prime minister on the telephone -- this is the morning of the 11th -- did he mention to you, or discuss in any way, the assassination of the former prime minister, Agathe Uwilingiyimana? 
A.	No.  He didn't mention it.  We only spoke of the meeting, he didn't talk about that.  We only discussed the meeting that was going to be held. 
Q.	Did he discuss at all any of the other assassinations that had taken place by then, for example the president of the constitutional court?  
A.	No. 
Q.	All right.  Directing your attention to the meeting itself; you had mentioned that this took place at the Hôtel des Diplomate.  Can you tell us what time the meeting started, who was present, and what you observed at the Hôtel des Diplomate? 
A.	The meeting began at about 11 a.m.  It was held on the ground floor near the main entrance.  As to the participants, there were the préfets, the ministers, the president of the republic, and the prime minister also attended.  We could hear gunfire.  That was the situation that prevailed.  We could hear heavy artillery and gunfire not far from Hôtel des Diplomate.  I remember that a bomb fell on the hospital, the CHK, not far from the Hôtel des Diplomate.  So everyone was afraid.  The participants were afraid.  We ourselves were afraid. 
Q.	Do you recall approximately how many persons participated in this meeting? 
A.	About 30.  I'd say between 30 and 40. 
Q.	Bearing in mind that there were 11 préfectures at the time, who were the other 20 or so people in attendance, aside from the préfets?  
A.	I think there were 12 préfectures, including that of Kigali urban.  Now, who else?  Well, the ministers, the president, state president, which is about 30 people.  And maybe there were some other people sitting in the back, or behind us.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
What the witness said could mean either. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Do you recall if any of the national leaders of the various political parties that participated in the government, whether their political party leadership was also present at this event?  
A.	That I don't remember. 
Q.	What about soldiers?  Were there any soldiers present? 
A.	I do not recall.  I don't remember that, either. 
Q.	Were there any préfets who were not in attendance?  
A.	At that time the préfet of Butare was not in attendance, nor was the préfet of Byumba.  He was replaced when the government arrived in Gitarama.  I think there was a third one who was missing; it must be the préfet of Ruhengeri.  Ruhengeri.  In fact, to answer more completely, I should like to say that while we were in the meeting in Kigali, I noted the absence of the préfet of Butare, because I already knew he would not be available.  But I subsequently learned that the préfet of Byumba was not at the meeting, because he was replaced a bit later.  I think, also, the préfet of Ruhengeri was not in attendance. 
Q.	Can you tell us what the objective of the meeting was, as you understood it?  
A.	The stated purpose on the agenda was that the participants should get to know each other, introduce themselves to each other, and the préfet would speak of the situation prevailing in their préfectures.  Those were the two items that had been slated on the agenda. 
Q.	To the extent that you can remember, tell us the most significant -- the most significant things that were said at the meeting and who said them.  When you reflect back, what is most significant to you in terms of what was said or what transpired at that meeting?  
A.	The salient points?  Well, as regards to the reciprocal introductions, each minister introduced himself and spoke of the ministry in his charge.  After the introductions -- the state president didn't introduce himself, of course, but the prime minister introduced himself to us.  The ministers introduced themselves to us.  After the ministers, it was the prefects' turn to introduce themselves and to speak of their préfectures, and each prefect spoke of the situation prevailing in their respective préfectures.  

As to the speeches made, the prime minister had in hand a speech, which constituted a programme, a plan, which he read from beginning to end.  And this was broadcast several times on the radio.  When it was broadcast over the radio, and they spoke of this speech, which was a government's programme, so referred to as the speech that constituted the government's programme.  And after he'd read out his government programme, he said that the soldiers -- the RFP soldiers had exited from the CND, and other RPF soldiers were coming from Byumba to attack the country, and the government was decided to combat the RPF, and we were ready to fight them once they reached us.  He did not discuss tactics.  He did not discuss other specific instructions.  

I also remember that the meeting did not last long.  There were no questions.  It was said that the meeting was adjourned, and that after lunch the meeting would resume.  But when we came back, the meeting did not resume, for reasons of safety or security.  That's what we were told.  And as the bomb had fallen on the CHK, the hospital, we went home.  

As the Butare prefect was not at the meeting, the prime minister, Kambanda, singled him out and said the Butare prefect was the only person absent without good reason, without good cause, and that he would pay dearly for that.  That's what the prime minister said.  

And those are the most important points that spring to mind that I can recall for the moment. 
Q.	Do you recall if there was any discussion of the killing of the prime minister, Agathe Uwilingiyimana? 
A.	No.  The death of the prime minister was not discussed.  I've just told you what the agenda was, and there were no extraneous comments, there were no other comments, whereas, the prefects did speak of the situation in their respective préfectures. 
Q.	Was there any denunciation of the killing of the president of the constitutional court by the national authorities during that meeting? 
A.	No.  No one denounced that assassination.  It did not even come up.  That assassination was not even mentioned. 
Q.	What about the killings of the other ministers that had been proposed for the broad-based transitional government?  Here I'm thinking of Minister Lando, and there was a PSD minister, as well.  Was there any discussion of their absence, or what had happened to them prior to that meeting on the 11th?  
A.	No.  The matter was not broached. 
Q.	What about the killings that were going on in Kigali?  Was that discussed in any way, or denounced?  
A.	There again, no one mentioned it.  However, the then-prefect of Kigali said that the soldiers working with the Interahamwe were fighting the enemy on all fronts in the town, and that the army was in a good position.  But they never mentioned the cases of civilians or other people killed. 
Q.	If you put yourself in the frame of mind of the 11th of April, in that meeting hall, at that time -- I'm not talking about now -- but putting yourself in the frame of mind of the 11th of April, did you view the national authorities of that interim government as being genocidal in nature at that time on the 11th?  
A.	Well, let me speak frankly.  I could see that the whole thing was a pantomime they were indulging in.  Because I, who attended that meeting, after having seven of my family -- seven relatives of mine who had just been killed, and I heard 23 people -- members of my family had been killed in Kanombe, and I came knowing -- to the meeting knowing about all that.  The seven people I'm talking about lived very near to the central bank, near to Z's house, and they had been killed by soldiers.  So I don't see how, possibly, in a meeting of the highest authorities where there is no public safety and security, where ministers have been killed, members of our families have been killed, how can you hold a meeting where the prime minister is present and when one doesn't discuss those things?  

As far as I was concerned, I, who knew the whole situation, could only say that it -- what was being said was lies, in the face of all that I knew. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  What did you observe in Kigali on your way either to the meeting on the 11th, or from the meeting on the 11th?  Can you describe what you saw?  Very briefly.  
A.	I saw corpses on the road.  There's the central roundabout.  From that roundabout, you carry on down to the Nyabugogo, leading to the Nyabarongo.  There were many corpses all the way down, and many roadblocks.  So that -- that if you wish to cross the town, it would be very difficult to pass all the roadblocks.  It took me about an hour, and I had to get out of my vehicle on three occasions.  Now, all the soldiers who were with me, escorting me, said, "This is the préfet of Gitarama."  And they said, "That one, he's an accomplice."  That's how they greeted me.  "That one, he's an accomplice."  
Q.	Do you recall what time it was -- excuse me -- do you recall when it was that you went back to Gitarama?  Was it --
A.	I returned to Gitarama between 1 and 2 p.m., but it was before 2 p.m.  As I said, as I've told you, the meeting did not last long.  And then when there was the break, and then it was said that the meeting could not continue because of insecurity, and that's when I returned to Gitarama.  I think it was near to 2 p.m. when I left. 
Q.	All right.  Mr. Witness, let's talk about the events of the following day, on the 12th.  Can you tell us what happened on that day, the very next day?  
A.	On the 12th the interim government and the followers, the party people, came to Gitarama.  They said that they were on their way to Gisenyi, but meanwhile they took their seat in Gitarama.  That was the most important event on that day.  And amongst them there was the state president and his government.  So they arrived on the 12th, and they took their seat at Murambi.  I hosted the president at my home, my residence; which is by way of telling you I know what happened and the circumstances of the government's arrival.  
Q.	Was the arrival of the government in Gitarama something that had been coordinated ahead of time?  In other words, had arrangements been made with you prior to the arrival of these dignitaries from Kigali?  
A.	No, I had not been alerted.  In fact, I learned that they had arrived when I heard the noise of motors of the vehicles that came towards the préfecture, the military camp, and the prison.  So I went to see what the commotion was, and I learned that the president, prime minister, et cetera, were in those vehicles.  Otherwise, I had not been alerted beforehand.  And then they told me they were making a break -- taking a break on their way to Gisenyi.  And then they changed their minds and decided to take up their seat in Gitarama, under those circumstances. 
Q.	All right, Mr. Witness.  But give us a bit of a narrative here.  Tell us what you saw, who you spoke to, what you did in order to respond to this unexpected arrival.  So just give us a bit of the story here.  When the cars arrived, what did you do, who did you speak to?  Just briefly, though.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
Oh, sorry, sorry.  My microphone again.  Could you ask him to stop, and I'll catch up?  
THE WITNESS:  
He came down -- he came down from his office.  He said -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
The witness said --
THE WITNESS:  
I came down from my office in the préfectoral building.  I stood next to the main entrance.  There was an armoured car bearing UN insignia, and behind several vehicles, some Mercedes Benzes and other vehicles.  And then out of the armoured car came Colonel Rutayisire, and came up and greeted me.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Perhaps he could continue from there. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we lost a bit of what you were saying because of a technical problem.  So we got as far as you being greeted by Colonel Rutayisire.  Tell us what happened with the rest of the delegation.  Did you receive anyone in your office or in your home?  And did you take any -- did you do anything in order to make arrangements for this interim government delegation? 
A.	Yes.  I had said -- I was saying, Colonel Rutayisire asked me if I was informed that the president of the republic, state president, was coming to Gitarama.  He seemed offended by that, and went back to the armoured car.  Then General Ndindiliyimana came out, came up and greeted me, and told me that he just learned that I hadn't been informed of the arrival of the state president in Gitarama.  I told -- I confirmed that.  And so he -- then he said, "Well, do what you must to host the president."  And I asked, "Well, can I host him in my office?"  And he smiled and said, "No, that would not be possible."  So then I asked him, "Where can I host him?"  Because nothing had been prepared.  

May I continue?  
Q.	Please do.  
A.	May I continue?  

Then he told me, "At least welcome the state president in your residence, in your home."  I said, "Fine, okay."   Which I did.  He came to my house.  I welcomed him, I greeted him.  He was with his spouse, his wife, and a young child, the son of the senator who is now in Kigali.  We sat in the living room, his wife, the young girl, and myself.  I asked him, "What is the news?"  And he said, "The news is good," and then -- and said no more.  I said, "How were things in Kigali?"  And he said, "Oh, a shot here, a shot there," and stopped talking again.  So thirdly, I asked him if he would like something to drink.  He answered that he would, so I tried to see if there was anything to drink in the refrigerator, and there was nothing there.  So I asked someone to go -- should I send someone to go and buy a drink outside?  He said no.  But I insisted, and so he agreed.  

So I went out, and at that moment I saw Kambanda standing next to the Prosecutor's house.  He was with Eliezer and other people.  I told him, "The president is alone.  At least two of you should go and keep him company."  I went to town, and came back with some beer and some soda pop.  

When I got back to my living room, Kambanda and two or three other people were there, and they took some drinks.  And as they went home, General Ndindiliyimana came in and made a sign at me, calling me over.  And then he said, "We had intention of going on to Gisenyi, but as the president is tired" -- and indeed we could see that he was sick -- "he asked me to find somewhere for him to stay."  And I was saying, "What can I do?  There's no proper hotel in Gitarama."

So I told him, "Let me go and see the archbishop at Kabgayi.  I know from time to time he has visitors.  Perhaps I can find a solution."  And moreover, there was the main seminary, by the name of Philosophicum, which might have appropriate lodgings.  So I went off to Kabgayi, but I couldn't find anything.  The archbishop said he had no free lodging.  However, near the main seminary, the senior seminary, I talked with the director, and I saw that the lodgings were not appropriate.  

So I came back to report on what I'd done, and I found everyone had disappeared.  I asked my wife where all the people had gone, and she said they'd all gone to Murambi.  I said, "Thank God," because I was under some sort of pressure, also.  I asked her for some food, and I went to rest.  In the evening, I went to Murambi, and I could see people moving around, carrying their luggage.  

And those are the circumstances under which I hosted them, if one can properly speak of hosting or receiving in that case.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Beyond making arrangements to host this delegation, what was the impact of the arrival of this national delegation in Gitarama?  Tell us what happened after the arrival of the interim government on the 12th.
A.	In what respect, in terms of security?  Social?  Legal?  I don't know what you mean, what you mean by that. 
Q.	In terms of the security situation, Mr. Witness, did the arrival of the interim government delegation on the 12th have an impact on local affairs, security, in your locality?  
A.	Yes, there was an impact.  First of all, when the government came to Gitarama, he brought along some other people who were not ministers; politicians, officials of political parties, who also settled in Murambi.  And most of those people -- now, that government also came with the Interahamwe.  It was public knowledge, everyone saw them.  The Interahamwes came with that government.  And upon their arrival, insecurity came in to play.  Particularly, in the Runda commune, Taba commune, and particularly in the Kamonyi location.  I do recall that in Kamonyi, they went to a school and perpetrated some acts which prompted the head mistress of the school, a religious sister, to come to Murambi to report -- or to move to Gitarama.  They even went to Rwabashashya.  And wherever they went, people had firearms, were engaged in committing massacres.  They continued with those actions.  And when they settled in that area -- I would even mention the fact that there were gendarmes and soldiers who came with that government.  
Q.	You talked about the increasing insecurity, and you mentioned attacks.  Who were committing the attacks?  You used the word "they" quite often.  I'm trying to be a bit more specific.  
A.	The attackers were the Interahamwe leaders.  Acts of aggression, or the very first documented attacks, were carried out by the Interahamwe.  Of course, there were soldiers; but those attacks were carried out by the Interahamwe.  They were trying to find out how to settle, how to secure food, and other relief.  You are asking me who engaged in those attacks.  Well, those in charge of the Interahamwes, because they had people who were their leaders.
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  I'm sorry?  
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I think this latter -- or last line of questioning was -- we didn't receive any notice with respect to that last line of questioning.  I need to object with respect to those last two questions and the answers provided by the witness. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
The questions about the Interahamwe attacking in Gitarama?  This witness has made eight statements, at least, and in every single one of them he talks about attacks by Interahamwe.  I can go through them and look for specific references, but I don't think it's at all necessary. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You can continue, Mr. Webster.  You can continue. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  Mr. Witness, how did you as préfet respond to this increasing insecurity?  
A.	First of all, let me say it was difficult, very difficult, for me.  Secondly, it was not easy to manage that situation.  At the time when some of the key officials who could have assisted me were dismissed -- were dismissed, and the new government dismissed all those peoples -- people.  And it became pretty difficult.  And I did everything in my power to deal with the situation.  

At any rate, I tried to deal with these attacks that had been launched against us, and I spoke to you about the attacks carried out by the Interahamwe.  And when the former head mistress came to seek assistance from me, I went to this spot thinking I could exercise some authority on those people.  Unfortunately, when I got there, I noticed they were with their leaders, and they made a mockery of me, and I had to leave the venue as fast as I could.  I tried to check those roadblocks.  In fact, they set up a roadblock in Cyakabiri, and in some area known as Cyamatongo towards Gitarama.  I tried to dismantle those roadblocks, but each time again, time and time again, they set them up.  

I would add that they came with a lot of people who had sought refuge at Gitarama; so much so, that the town was submerged, as it were, by those people.  I tried as much as people -- as much as possible to have people who had been displaced, those who had escaped the killings, et cetera -- so I tried to put people in vehicles, in buses, so as to move them back to their native areas.  I also turned to the bourgmestres, and some of them did act.  I asked them to issue identity cards which would enable people to live in town without their ethnic group -- that is, that of Tutsis -- being known, so they continued to live there without any problems. 
Q.	Thank you for your response, Mr. Witness.  Let's direct our attention to any other meetings that you may have organised with your bourgmestres.  You mentioned two meetings to us already prior to the arrival of the interim government.  Did there come a time that you organised another meeting of bourgmestres? 
A.	No.  There were no other meetings, but we acted on a case-by-case basis.  What does that mean?  If a bourgmestre were to raise a security problem with me, a security problem at his area, I would advise him to take those who were being targeted and move them to Kabgayi.  
Q.	We may get to that a little further on.  

Did there come a time, on the 18th of April, that you either organised or participated in another meeting of regional or local Gitarama authorities?  Directing your attention to the 18th of April.  
A.	Oh, yes.  There was a meeting that was scheduled for the 18th, a meeting of the bourgmestre, and leaders of political parties within the Gitarama préfecture. 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)  Go on.  
A.	I had scheduled that meeting.  The meeting did take place, but it was torpedoed, or thwarted, because it did not proceed in the manner in which I had intended. 
Q.	Who organised that meeting on the 18th?  Was it a meeting that you called in your capacity as préfet, or was it arranged by other means?  
A.	I summoned the meeting of the bourgmestres and officials, or leaders of political parties, based in Gitarama.  Now, I'm not talking about political officials in Kigali.  Now, that meeting normally had to take place at the préfectoral office.  It had a purpose.  But then it did not proceed in the manner in which it was prepared by myself.  Because I told you that that meeting was taken over by the prime minister, Kambanda, and some other type of meeting was organised, but not the one that I had intended. 
Q.	Thank you.  When you were making arrangements for this meeting, how far in advance did you contact the persons that you intended to be invited to this meeting?  
A.	I started sending out messages from the 16th, and even from the 15th.  But then, in the meantime, I informed each bourgmestre who came to seek my assistance in the events he or she -- he was facing a problem, because problems of insecurity had become -- had started coming to the fore in certain communes.  Some crimes were being committed in certain communes.  And so I told them, let us hold a meeting on the 18th, and let us identify all these problems; that is, all these crimes that are committed by the Interahamwes, and then we're going to prepare a memo for submission to the government, so that the government can assume its responsibility.  Because we understood that we were going to be overtaken by events, and the attackers were people over whom we had no authority.  And, therefore, since the government was there, it had to do something.  And let me not hide it from you, with that kind of situation, I was going to resign.  But prior to that, I wanted to be sure of the support of the bourgmestre, just to show to the government that it was in charge; it was responsible for that situation.  
Q.	What time was the meeting supposed to begin?  
A.	That meeting had to start at 8 o'clock.  Then at about 9, virtually all the bourgmestres -- actually, all the sous-préfets, were at the venue. 
Q.	What happened next? 
A.	After that, in an unexpected manner, the private secretary -- and I'm talking of the private secretary of the prime minister -- came, together with soldiers.  He found me in my office.  The bourgmestres were already there.  And then he spoke.  He told me the prime minister had been informed of the fact that I had convened a meeting of bourgmestres, and he himself would have wanted to have come and attend the said meeting and address the meeting.  And my reply was, well, I thought the prime minister was not going to come to such a meeting since that was a meeting with its own particular agenda, that the meeting had been prepared in a particular way.  That it was, further, our intention to submit a report on the meeting to him.  And I, also, said there was a problem of protocol.  I couldn't see how the prime minister was going to come and attend a meeting of the bourgmestre where -- particularly, as he was not invited to the meeting.  And in the meantime, I was wondering whether he was going to be the person to chair the meeting, whether it was going to be myself to chair the meeting.  So there was a problem of protocol.  

And instead of answering that question in a reasonable manner, to that reasonable question, the private secretary told me, "You, préfet, I notice that you are, indeed, the type of person that I am told of -- or they told me about."  And then he smiled and added the following:  "The prime minister has the right to say whatever and all of what he intends to say, and to whomsoever he would want to say any such things."  Now, when I saw that he was angry, then I understood that there was a problem.  And I said, "Fine.  Do as you wish."  

Sorry.  Sorry.  

Now, before he left, he added something else, he said something else.  He said, "When all the bourgmestres will be present, please notify the prime minister so that he can come."  And then he left.  The private secretary left.  

And after that I called the sous-préfet of Ruhango, I also called the sous-préfet in charge of administrative matters, by the name Kagaba, and I sought their opinion in light of that statement by the private secretary.  The sous-préfet of Ruhango told me, "Fidèle, you're not that popular here.  It is being said that you are an accomplice.  An accomplice.  They are going to pick up -- they are trying to pick a bone with you.  And you must do all that he says you should do; otherwise, you are going to suffer some adverse consequences." 

And so I asked the sous-préfet of Mugaba (sic) to go to Murambi, and say -- to say that all the sous-préfets were present.  A few moments later the private secretary to the prime minister came and said, "The prime minister would like to further say that for reasons of security he won't be in a position to move from Murambi to come and attend the meeting at the préfectoral office.  And, therefore, your bourgmestres -- that is, yourself, and the bourgmestres -- would have to move to Murambi."  

So I told everyone, the bourgmestres, the sous-préfets, and the representatives of political parties at Nyamabuye, everyone was represented, the president -- sorry -- the chairman of PL was Tutsi, Mr. Malaki (phonetic).  The chairman of PSD, also.  So from the ethnic standpoint, there was no problem.  
So when -- we all moved to Murambi.  And when we got there, they wanted to prevent the Tutsis from attending.  And I was told Tutsis should not be allowed to enter.  
Q.	All right.  We're going to have to go a bit slower, Mr. Witness.  How many persons had gathered at the Gitarama préfecture office before you all moved in a group to Murambi, approximately?  
A.	I didn't count the number, you understand.  I summoned all of them.  But what I can tell you is that there were enough people.  I asked, "Is everyone there?"  And I was told, "Yeah, we can start the meeting."  As for the number, I did not count. 
Q.	Did your meeting actually start before you transferred the meeting to Murambi?  In other words, did you start to address your agenda items?  
A.	No.  That meeting never started.  The hall had been prepared, we were just about to start, when -- after I had been informed that everyone was there, that was when the private secretary came and the whole thing was overhauled, and then the format changed.  I don't know whether you've understood me.  I thought I was quite clear on this one. 
Q.	Now, you've mentioned this private secretary.  Would you describe this person, please, and tell us his name, if you know?  Was this a military person, a civilian?  When you say "private secretary," give us an idea who you're talking about.  
A.	I don't remember his name.  It was someone wearing a military uniform, he was carrying a gun, and he was escorted by three soldiers.  I would say that he was maybe a civilian.  One could notice that he was a civilian because during that period officials carried weapons, wore military shirt -- wore military shirt.  He was a civilian.  I don't remember his name.  It was the first time I was seeing him.  I didn't know him prior to that.  
Q.	How did the group move from Gitarama préfecture hall to Murambi?  What arrangements were put in place to move the meeting? 
A.	We were in vehicles.  Each bourgmestre had a vehicle, a pickup.  All those bourgmestres who came with vehicles, used their vehicles.  And those who didn't have vehicles had to travel with the others in their vehicles.  But we moved in a convey.

1530H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Would you describe how things appeared to you at Murambi when you arrived there?  How had Murambi changed with the arrival of the interim government? 
A.	There was a gendarmerie station in charge of guarding the government.  There were 
armoured vehicles, vehicles belonging to Radio Rwanda, two vehicles belonging to a mobile station of 
Radio Rwanda.  In addition, there was -- other services were functioning, that is, the services at Murambi, so much so that there were people whom I could identify who were working there.  Those people even had computers, and one noticed that they were working.  There weren't other people there at Murambi.  

So, I was saying to you that there were three people who had been prevented from moving in.  And I was determined -- I said, if those three people were not allowed to go in, I myself, I was going to get out and move away.
Q.	What was preventing the three people from entering?  Explain that to us, please.
A.	They were being characterised as accomplices.  And the commanding officer not far from there had to intervene so that they be allowed to move in.  Ultimately, they were allowed to move into the hall, and so we all got into the classroom, and we found Prime Minister Kambanda who was sitting alone, we greeted him, and then we sat down in front, and then the officials in charge of political parties and ministers joined us, and the meeting started.
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, is now a convenient time to pause?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Thank you.  We will take our mid-afternoon recess now for about 15 minutes. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl?  
MR. WEYL:
I should like to ask the Trial Chamber what its intentions are as far as tomorrow is concerned or whether we are sitting or not. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, how much more time do you have in chief?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I was hoping to finish by the end of today, but I don't think it is likely, as a practical matter.  I had anticipated one full day for this witness.  Initially, I was trying to shave it down to three-quarters of a day, but I don't think we are going to make it.  We did get a late start this morning, so I will try to move as quickly as we can.  If I can finish today I'll do that, but it may spill over a bit into tomorrow morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, Mr. -- Mr. Weyl, we would like to finish the examination-in-chief before we take the adjournment for the weekend.  So if Mr. Webster doesn't succeed in the closing out of the examination this afternoon, we will sit tomorrow morning.  
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, My Lord.  
(Court recessed from 1535H to 1558H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, as an addendum to your application, if you suggested to Mr. Webster that the Court might sit a little bit later than 5:30, if he could finish this afternoon, then we would not have to sit tomorrow.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, it has been some time now that we know that we are in the Prosecutor's hands.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Could I reserve my response to that application?  We can see how we are going, and then when we get to 5:30, we can make a decision at that point.  But -- I'm certainly open to that, but I'm not as optimistic as I would like to be. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. 
MR. WEBSTER:
And I will try to slow down.  I know that last response was very quick, and I apologise. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry.  I have not allowed the registrar to indicate how much time you have taken up to now.  

Madam Registrar?  
MS. N'GUM:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I just wanted to bring to your attention the fact that the Accused persons will probably have to be taken to UNDF in good time, so even if we have to do overtime, we have to check the correct time before they get to UNDF.  

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for that reminder.  
MR. WEBSTER:
That shouldn't be a problem for us.  But perhaps the -- I'm not sure if the registry -- or maybe I misunderstood the Court's request. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The -- no, I had misunderstood the request that she had made. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  I'm sorry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
She wanted to intervene, and I thought from past experience, as she has been sitting with me in another case where she was very strict on timekeeping, I thought that she wanted to say how much time you had been occupying up to now.  

Are you ready with that information, Madam Registrar?  
MS. N'GUM:
I've noted it, but I've not added it all up, Your Lords.  I can do that in a few minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Okay, Mr. Witness, we had left off when you were telling us about entering a classroom at Murambi and seeing the prime minister.  So let's pick up from there, and if you can just reflect back and, to the best of your recollection, tell us what happened during the course of that day.  So start with going into the classroom and seeing the prime minister.
A.	I have no translation.  I have no translation.
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  The registry will help us.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.  I will begin again. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	We left off when you were telling us about going into a classroom in Murambi and seeing the prime minister seated at a desk, or something along those lines.  Can you pick up at that point, reflect back, and to the best of your recollection tell us what transpired that day at Murambi?  Tell us -- go step by step -- everything that you remember about that meeting.
A.	Thank you.  When we got to Murambi, we saw the prime minister, who was already sitting, so we greeted him, and shortly thereafter a lot of people arrived, namely, some ministers, some politicians, who also sat.  And so I took the floor and told the prime minister -- or, reported to him about the situation in Murambi.  And I had not understood why the meeting had been transferred, or moved, to Murambi in the presence of the prime minister.  I further told him that, at any rate, I myself and the bourgmestre had intended to hold a meeting to carry out an assessment and a listing of all reprehensible acts that had occurred in our préfecture.  We also had to talk about the perpetrators of such acts, and I told him that these acts were being committed, and since the ministers and politicians were in attendance, we had wanted to take advantage of their presence to carry out a listing of all these reprehensible acts, their perpetrators, and we had wanted that the government take measures to put an end to such conduct or such acts. 

We said that we were noticing that as things were evolving, and since this was contrary to what we had intended, that we were going to do everything in our power to put an end to the killings occurring in our préfecture, and we did not want that any such acts to continue, as was the case in Kigali. 

After that, I made mention one by one of all the acts that had been committed, together with their perpetrators, and I asked the prime minister to take the necessary measures in order to put an end to such conduct or acts, because he had the means to do so, to bring such matters to an end.  Instead of answering each of the issues, or dealing with each of the issues, that I raised, he took the paper that we had read on the 11th of April while we were in Kigali, he reread that document, or that speech, which amounted to a programme, and then he said, "You see, in this speech, in this programme of mine, no reference -- or, that one of the points was not that people should come and kill people in your préfecture, in other words, I had not ordered any person to come to your préfecture to conduct themselves in that manner."  When he said so, I asked each of the bourgmestres to take the floor so as to further back up or buttress what I had said.  

Now, the fact is that among the politicians who were there, some asked for the floor and spoke, but their statements were as if they were insulting me.  They even threatened me.  They asked me to resign from my position as the préfet, and so I was angry.
Q.	Let's take what you've already said and break it down bit by bit, because, at the beginning, you quite often expressed yourself by saying "we said," and you used the term "we."  And what I would like you to do, to the best of your ability, is tell us what you said and then what you recall anybody else saying.  So reflect back a bit, and before you get to the response of the other political leaders, tell us what you said and then what each bourgmestre said, and then give us the response that you got.
A.	I personally said that I had made a list of all reprehensible acts committed as reported to me by the bourgmestre or as myself I had observed.  So I talked about all those problems and I made reference to the perpetrators of such acts.  I expressed my regret over the fact that the authorities have not done anything to put an end to such acts.  

I don't know whether you want me to go into details about those acts.
Q.	I was just about to do that.  

When you said the perpetrators of the acts, tell us who you were referring to.  So, I don't want a long account, but give us a little bit more detail:  What did you complain about specifically?  Who did you complain about specifically? 
A.	It was particularly about the ministers.  I wasn't pleased with some of the ministers and some of the politicians.  I was also not pleased with the Interahamwe.  So those are the people about whom I complained.
Q.	Stop there.
A.	And the bourgmestre buttressed what I said. 
Q.	Which ministers, in particular, did you complain about and why? 
A.	I was not happy with the conduct of Minister Callixte Nzabonimana when I had a problem with him at Kamonyi, while he was with his colleague.  You see, at Kamonyi, the Interahamwes had attacked a school, and when I talked to him about my fears, namely, that the head mistress of that school had come to me to complain -- it was a girls' school, and the school had been -- or, property had been looted by the Interahamwes.  When I complained to him, he insulted me; he said I should get lost.  And he was accompanied by his other colleagues who were ministers.
Q.	Wait one second.  

For the record, Kamonyi is number 15 on our list.  

When you say Callixte Nzabonimana insulted you, where was this?  Did you mention the place when you were speaking to the meeting on the 18th?  Where did the event with Callixte Nzabonimana take place, and when, if you remember?  
A.	We were at Kamonyi, at the girls' secondary school, belonging to the Bernardine sisters, where the Interahamwes had seized or taken over control of the school; they had looted everything.  And the head mistress of that school had come to me to seek assistance.  And when I had gone to the spot, thinking that I was going to be able to succeed in driving them out of that school, Callixte sent me away.  He said he didn't give a damn about that school; that he had other problems. 
Q.	You also mentioned other ministers that were with him or other ministers with whom you had problems.  Give us the details on that, please.
A.	He was accompanied by another minister by the name Prosper.  They were in the same vehicle right from the time they got to Gitarama.  I also do remember -- it wasn't a minister -- he wasn't a minister; he was a conseiller or an advisor to the minister.  He was someone from Ruhango.  I've forgotten his name.  His name is Kayondo.  Kayondo was also present and quite a number of other people.  I wasn't that careful, and since I knew Callixte, I immediately moved towards him.  There were more than 
300 people; not less than 300 people were there.  But what we should remember is that -- was that I wanted the Interahamwes to get out of that school, but then I was turned back.  I was myself repulsed, as it were.  And I went to another centre by the name of Rwabashasha, and when I got there, the same thing happened to me again.
Q.	You mentioned a minister with Callixte Nzabonimana who you identified as Prosper.  Would that be Prosper Mugiraneza? 
A.	Yes, indeed, that's it.
Q.	All right.  Let's move on --  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me.  Excuse me, Mr. President.  Maybe I missed that, and I think there was maybe a mistake, but I thought his answer actually was "Nzabonimana, yego," which means "Nzabonimana, yes."  But he was asked about Mugiraneza, so I'm not sure that he has actually answered the question that was put to him, unless I'm mistaken. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I will clarify it.  I think it was just a loss of rhythm in the translation.  He said both things, but I will ask the question again.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm going to have to ask you to repeat your last answer.  You described 
Callixte Nzabonimana being accompanied by another minister and you identified that second person as Prosper.  And my question to you is, are you referring to Prosper Mugiraneza? 
A.	Yes, the minister in charge of public service; that was Prosper Mugiraneza. 
Q.	All right, thank you. 

All right.  Let's move away from the incident with Callixte Nzabonimana and Prosper Mugiraneza, 
and let's go back to the meeting.  Did you mention anything else when you were addressing the 
prime minister? 
A.	I also asked for the government to assume its responsibility, to guarantee security in our préfecture, and for the government to provide us with the means so as to prevent the Interahamwe -- or, even to order the Interahamwes to go back to Kigali; that they should go back to Kigali so that the situation would revert to what it was previously.  But then I understood that I was wasting my time.
Q.	Do you recall anything else of significance that you yourself said when you were first complaining to Prime Minister Kambanda? 
A.	I spoke about those acts committed in some other locations, illegal acts committed by the Gitarama gendarmerie, and that the day before they had removed the gendarmerie from Gitarama.  And so I told him that if I didn't have gendarmes, I wouldn't be able to act in areas where crimes were committed.  I gave him an example.  For instance, I was able to act in Kicukiro, close to the border with Kibuye, and I acted with Sibomana.  It was difficult, because I didn't have any gendarmes.  I told him that I needed gendarmes to assist me in such operations.  I told him that the government and political authorities, or officials, didn't have to interfere in the business of our préfecture.
Q.	You were talking about not being able to carry out operations, and I'm trying to clarify exactly what you mean.  And the places that you mentioned to us just a moment ago, can you -- I'm sorry, I didn't --
A.	The operations I'm talking about were with respect to providing assistance where such assistance was being sought or requested.
Q.	Who was requesting the assistance?  What type of assistance did you try to provide?  Be specific on those two points, please.
A.	Prosecutor, I think it is quite clear.  Anyone who asked me for assistance, like a préfet who says there had been attacks or Tutsis have been attacked, since they were the ones targeted, that's why I acted.  And as far as I'm concerned, I would seek the assistance of the gendarmerie so that we come in.  So that's what I meant when I talk about operations.  But, then, I had something like 80 gendarmes under my authority, and when they were all taken away, I felt disarmed; I wasn't then in a position to carry out such operations.  That's one.  

Secondly, among the ministers and the politicians, there were some people who were behind that kind of illicit, or illegal, behaviour.  There was a circulation of firearms given to young people, and people were surprised at the erection of roadblocks, and these people had firearms which they had received from Callixte Nzabonimana or Ukilikiyeyezu.  So that is the situation I had to deal with.  I had to say so.  So, these were the people who were preventing me from intervening in order to protect people.  

And there is something else.  All the means had been removed from my authority.  And I was not happy with those officials who were behind such illegal conduct.
Q.	You mentioned two people in your last response, and I would like to clarify it for the record.  Again, you mentioned Callixte Nzabonimana and there was a second name.  Would that be Ukilikiyeyezu?  Is that the name that you pronounced?  I don't think it came out clearly in the translation.
A.	Yes.  Ukilikiyeyezu, he was a soldier, a major, and a native of Gitarama. 
Q.	And Ukilikiyeyezu is number 80 on our spelling list.  

Now, when you say the means were taken away from you, and you referred to the 80 gendarmes, who took them away and why? 
A.	You know, the gendarmerie forms one unit.  I would have wanted to know why they were deployed somewhere else.  The prime minister did not tell me.  I was told that they had been dispatched to the war front with other elements of the gendarmerie.
Q.	And then you mentioned that Tutsi had been targeted.  Can you expand on that a bit?  Where these -- the locations that you suggested, what were those locations?  Were you talking about refugee camps, schools, hospitals?  Give us a bit more clarity on those points, please.  And who were the victims?  Or, who were you trying to protect? 
A.	I was protecting those who were the victims of the killings.  At the time these were Tutsis.  I don't know whether you have the documents that I signed with you.  You would notice that in the Mugina commune alone, there were a lot of Tutsis who had sought refuge in the parish and in the schools.  Yet, on the 18th, the Setiba group had already launched two attacks, and that group came from Kigali.  Musambira was also facing problems.  The people of Ruhango attacked our place at Byimana.  So more or less, everywhere we started experiencing problems requiring intervention.  There were problems in Nyakabanda; 31 people were killed in Nyakabanda.  The attackers came up and killed these people in the course of a meeting.  You understand that at the préfecture, the situation was critical.  If the government had assumed responsibility and acted, that was the time to act.  I had decided to leave that government, to resign.
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  

You mentioned giving the floor to the bourgmestres that had accompanied you to Murambi.  To the best of your recollection, tell us who among the bourgmestres spoke and what specifically each one complained of.
A.	We are talking about the Mugina bourgmestre who repeated what I had just said.  He said he had just been attacked by the Setiba team on two occasions.  He added that there were no arms with the 
six -- although the arms given to the six gendarmes who had to assist him in fighting the Setiba team had been withdrawn.  He also said that soldiers had launched an attack, five soldiers in all, and he had not succeeded in capturing them with his policemen.  Sorry.  He had succeeded -- correction -- he had succeeded in capturing them and had sent them to the Gitarama military camp for them to be detained.  And some three days later, those same soldiers were released, and he said that, in view of that, he was afraid.  He was afraid for his own life.  He felt that these soldiers were going to kill them.  

The other speaker was the Runda bourgmestre.  His name is Sixbert.  He made statements but then that contradicted his report to me.  He spoke about his report.  He would talk about attacks by the 
Setiba teams on two occasions - or, on those occasions that I had alluded to, but that when he spoke, instead of taking up what appeared in his report, which said that the Setiba team had killed some 
three people, he, rather, changed his submissions and said that those three people were killed because they had identified them as the accomplices and that they were carrying weapons.  And I was taken unawares; what he said really surprised me.  It was, if I may say so, not that surprising; it was in his habit.  

I do remember those two speakers.  Some other bourgmestre also spoke, but those are the ones that come into my mind.
Q.	All right.  If we could just go back a bit to the bourgmestre from Mugina.  When he complained of attacks, who had been attacked?  Who were the victims of those attacks?  You have to be explicit for the trial record, Mr. Witness.
A.	It was the Tutsi refugees who had sought refuge at the communal office and at the parish, at the convent, that is, with the nunnery, as well as at the primary school which is located there.  There were a lot of people who had sought refuge there.  They were Tutsis.  Among those Tutsis, there were even some who came from Kigali préfecture; some others from the Bugasira region.  The Tutsis who were there were not all natives of Gitarama. 
Q.	And when you recounted what the bourgmestre of Mugina said concerning his complaint that the gendarmes that he had caused to be arrested were released, do you know or did the bourgmestre say who released --
A.	They were not -- they were not gendarmes; they were soldiers, soldiers whom he had arrested; not gendarmes.
Q.	How -- 
A.	It was the soldiers who had been arrested and placed under detention.
Q.	Did he explain to the group how those soldiers came to be released, or do you know how those soldiers were released? 
A.	I do not know.  I think on the 17th, he came to see me and informed me that the soldiers had been released.  In other words, the local military commander, the major, did not inform me.  It was, rather, the bourgmestre who told me that he had seen those soldiers who had returned to Mugina and who had said that there was a problem -- they had a problem with him.  And during that meeting he tried to go along the same lines as my complaints, but you know what happened to him subsequently, I suppose.
Q.	Perhaps you should tell us now, Mr. Witness.  What happened to the bourgmestre of Mugina subsequently? 
A.	On the 21st or the 22nd, it was during the night that he was killed.  He was attacked and killed.  He was killed along with his brother-in-law and the driver of his vehicle.
Q.	Do you know who killed him? 
A.	I do not know who killed him, but there was information that we got subsequently, according to which the bourgmestre of Ntongwe played a part in the killing of that person.  Otherwise, he was killed at a roadblock, even though he was known.
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness. 

You also mentioned the bourgmestre of Runda, a person you identified as Sixbert.  Explain to us with a bit more detail why what the bourgmestre of Runda said surprised you in the context of that meeting.
A.	Let me tell you what surprised me.  During that meeting, he had just -- the participants saying that indeed Setiba's group had killed the three people, but that they had been killed because it had been discovered that they were accomplices and that they had weapons.  Among those killed there was the judicial police inspector, as well as another person called Rusine Myambaye (phonetic), and it was someone with whom I had worked before.  The third person, whose name I cannot recall, was also known to me.  What surprised me was that his speech, whereby those people were accomplices, was in contradiction with what he had told me.  That was not what was mentioned in his report, and that was not what I had told the prime minister, because it was not included in his report.  And this was proof that he had lied to me.  He gave me information that he did not provide subsequently.  I believe he said such a thing in order to be applauded.  I remember he was applauded.
Q.	He was applauded by whom? 
A.	The participants who were in the room applauded to show that he had provided a good answer.  We were in conflict.  There were two parties that were opposed to one another.  Somebody said that innocent people were being killed and the other was saying, "No, those who are dying are only the accomplices who have weapons and who are accomplices of the RPF who are being killed."  So that surprised me that a bourgmestre had hidden information from his préfet and was now talking about people who had weapons.  But where would the people have gotten the weapons from, the firearms from?  There were no firearms. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, if I could have Mr. Issa place this document in front of the witness.  This is the list of bourgmestres that we had worked with earlier, and you can show it to the Court and then to the Defence, please, before it is placed before the witness.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, what you have before you is a listing of the 17 communes you had mentioned to us earlier and the bourgmestres for each of those communes in April of 1994.  

Let's go one by one, and you will see a column there with the reference "18 April 1994."  And I would like us -- I would like you, rather, to tell us whether each of these listed bourgmestres was present with you in the meeting on the 18th of April and what you remember them saying to the best of your ability.  If you don't remember if they were there or not, just put a question mark on the document next to that person's name.  But if you do remember the person being there, write "yes" or a "oui," and if your recollection is that a specific person was not there, then indicate that by writing "no."  

So, let's go one by one.  If we start with number 1, ***************************************, 
*************************************, do you recall if he was present with you in Murambi on the 
18th of April? 
A.	He was there, I remember. 
Q.	Do you remember if he said anything to the group and what he said? 
A.	No, I don't remember.
Q.	What about number 2, commune, Bulinga, the bourgmestre, Martin Nsabimana?  Was he present on the 18th of April? 
A.	Yes, he was.
Q.	Do you recall if he said anything? 
A.	No, I don't believe he took the floor.
Q.	Number 3, Masongo, Louis Nizeyumukiza.  
A.	Very few bourgmestres took the floor.
Q.	Okay.  Let's move on to number 3.  Was that person present? 
A.	I believe he was present. 
Q.	And I will rely on you volunteering an answer if any of the persons we mentioned actually spoke.  

So I'm assuming Mr. Nizeyumukiza did not speak, as best as you can remember.
A.	I don't remember.
Q.	We've already --
A.	In fact, I had spoken on their behalf.
Q.	We'd already discussed number 4, Mugina, which was Callixte Ndagijimana.  So we will go on to number 5, Mukingi, Nsabimana.  Was he present and did he say anything? 
A.	He was present and he did not take the floor.
Q.	What about number 6, for Murama? 
A.	He was not there.  And, subsequently, I asked him why he had not come; in fact, I sent him a letter, and I remember that he was not present at the meeting.
Q.	What about number 7, for Musambira? 
A.	He was present, and he took the floor.
Q.	Do you remember what he said? 
A.	He said that one Abdalahman had set up a roadblock right next to the statue.  I do not know the locality.  In fact, he also said that Abdalahman had taken people to a locality, the name of which I do not recall, for them to be killed.  He said that he had set up a roadblock there and that he had killed people.  There were people who had been killed at the Musambira parish and others had sought refuge at Kabgayi. 
Q.	For the record, Abdalahman is number 1 on our spelling list. 

Have you completed your response with respect to the bourgmestre of Musambira?  Did he say anything else, or shall we move on? 
A.	We can move to the next one. 

Listen, I had forgotten something.  He said that he had been chased from his commune and he went to live with his father-in-law,  Habimana, and when he came to the meeting he was coming from Byimana and not from his own commune. 
Q.	Thank you.  For number 8, Mushubati, was he present? 
A.	That one was not present; he was in training.
Q.	In training where? 
A.	In Europe.  And when he left, I had not been informed of his departure for training.  When you are the bourgmestre, there is a procedure one has to go through; the préfet gives you the information.  But regarding this bourgmestre, I heard that he had left and had gone in training, and he came back in May.
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness. 

Number 9, Runda, you've already mentioned Sixbert Ndayambaje.  Would you like to expand on your answer, or has your answer been complete concerning what Sixbert said during the meeting? 
A.	I don't have anything to add.
Q.	For number 10, Taba, do you recall if Jean Paul Akayesu was present, and, if he was, did he say anything to the group? 
A.	He was present, but he did not take the floor.  I do not remember him taking the floor, no.  He did not take the floor.
Q.	For number 11, Nyabikenke?  
A.	He was present.  I asked him to take the floor, and he refused.  I told him, "You are the 
Nyabikenke bourgmestre.  You should tell everyone how Minister Callixte is launching attacks."  Because in the report he had made to me, that was mentioned.  He said that Callixte was assembling the Interahamwe, and that the Interahamwe were starting to launch attacks against the population.  But when I gave the floor to him, he refused to speak.  I asked him to tell about what he had written in the report, and he refused.
Q.	Thank you.  When you say Callixte, you are referring to Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	Yes, Minister -- yes, Callixte, the minister.  He hailed from the same commune as that bourgmestre.
Q.	Thank you.  The next one is Kayenzi.  Do you recall if Mr. Jean Mbarubukeye was there? 
A.	I do not recall.  I believe he did not attend, because this commune is far away, and there was no telephone in order to reach him.  I believe he was not present at the meeting. 
Q.	For number 13, Nyakabanda?  
A.	That one was present, and he took the floor. 
Q.	What did he say? 
A.	He said that a lieutenant who came from his locality had deserted from the war front in Shyorongi and had come to kill 31 people, including a teacher.  After that, he stole the vehicle of Father Bourget.  And those were events I had mentioned in my speech, but he also referred to them.  The lieutenant in question was called Nzimurinda, a lieutenant who killed 31 Tutsis.  He hailed from Nyakabanda, in the commune of that bourgmestre.
Q.	Thank you.  

And for the record, there was a mention of Shyorongi, which is number 73 on our spelling list.  

For number 14, Rutobwe, was Mr. Mporanzi present at this meeting? 
A.	Yes, Mporanzi was present, he was there, but he did not take the floor.  I asked him to explain how he had been beaten as he had stated in his report.  As I had mentioned, I asked him to elaborate, but he refused to take the floor.  Obviously, he was afraid because he was taking the floor in front of ministers, and the ministers had noted that he was afraid.
Q.	All right.  Thank you. 
Number 15, Tambwe, was Nathan Mugaga there?  
A.	He was present, but he did not take the floor. 
Q.	Number 16, for Kigoma, was Mr. Ugirashebuja there? 
A.	He was there, but he did not take the floor.
Q.	And the last one, for Ntongwe, was Charles Kagabo there? 
A.	He was present, but he did not take the floor.
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness. 

All right.  Let's begin to talk about the national authorities that were present and that spoke.  Aside from Prime Minister Kambanda, you said that there were ministers present.  Do you remember which ones were there?  Do you have a specific recollection of any particular person being present and speaking?  Let's not get into what they said now.  Just tell us who spoke and who you recognised among the national authorities.
A.	There was, first of all, Prime Minister Kambanda who took the floor and Justin Mugenzi, minister of trade and handicrafts.  I believe that was his ministry.  There were other people who addressed the participants.  Callixte did not take the floor.
Q.	Are you referring to Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	Yes.  I saw him scratching his head.  

Yes, I am referring to Nzabonimana.  

What I was saying was that he was present but that he did not take the floor; he did not speak.  Then there are people who took the floor but who were not ministers, and I can give you their names, if you so wish. 
Q.	Please do so.
A.	There was Minister Karemera -- well, he became minister subsequently, but he took the floor on that occasion.  Then President Mathieu Ngirumpatse also took the floor.  He was present.  Other people could have spoken, but I do not remember because I believe those speeches were not that important.  But there are people who took the floor whose speech was harsh, and this is the reason why I still remember them.
Q.	All right.  So you've mentioned five people so far:  Kambanda, Mugenzi, Nzabonimana, 
Édouard Karemera and Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  

Can you remember any other national authorities specifically?  I know you told us there was a group of ministers and politicians, but does anybody else specifically come to mind from the 18th of April? 
A.	Frankly speaking, those are the names I recall because of the harshness of the speeches they made.  I was quite frightened by their utterances.
Q.	All right.  Begin by telling us, again, how Kambanda responded to your complaints, and then tell us what the other national authorities said, the ones that you remember.
A.	After my report and a brief summary of the illegal acts perpetrated in our préfecture and after I asked my bourgmestres to assist me and to take the floor, Prime Minister Kambanda made his speech.  He read it out and did not finish it.  In the middle of his speech, he told me, "You have realised yourself that there is no order whatsoever in this speech to kill the Tutsis, and that is why I am saying that those who are perpetrating such acts are doing it of their own volition."  I answered him that I was not satisfied by this answer, because I was already aware of the contents of the speech he had read out to us, but I wanted him to adopt concrete measures.  I spoke politely but that was what I said.  But after that, Kambanda did not say anything to me.  On the other hand, the politicians who were in the hall, the ones I referred to earlier on, including the ministers, were those who responded instead of the prime minister.
Q.	All right.  Tell us what you recall Justin Mugenzi saying.  
A.	Mugenzi took the floor after the others, but his speech was so harsh that, after it was made, I decided to leave the room.  He said, "Mr. Prime Minister, I believe we are wasting our time here."  He went on to say that the answer was available; that is to say that the préfet of that préfecture and his bourgmestres did not want to understand the current policy, and that that category of people were to be dismissed.  And he was applauded.  I was under pressure, and when he made such comments, I left the room.  

I said to the prime minister, "Mr. Prime Minister, I came to talk to you, hoping that I would find solutions to the problems we are faced with.  Now you hear what your ministers are saying.  I would rather leave."  

But before Mugenzi, other people had also taken the floor.
Q.	All right.  Tell us what Édouard Karemera said.
A.	Karemera was against what I had said.  He defended the Interahamwe and the MRND, because I had spoken of the MRND and I had said that the MRND was supervising the Interahamwe.  At the time the Interahamwe were the youth wing of the MRND, but during the genocide this was a word that became insulting.  But those who were the Interahamwes who were involved in the acts that were perpetrated at the time.  

This is what Karemera said:  "Mr. Prime Minister, I am telling you that Mr. Fidèle who made this speech, ever since he has -- he became préfet here in Gitarama has always been against the MRND and the Interahamwe.  He worked with Nsengiyaremye, Dismas, who had been prime minister -- he worked with the prime minister to fight against our party.  They dismantled the structures of our party, and they dismissed the bourgmestres who were MRND members.  And he is talking about the Interahamwe.  This is someone who is just engaging in politics, and this to the benefit of his party." 

So this was the gist of what he said.  He stated that I had not enabled the Interahamwe to continue working in the structures, that I was lying, that I was biased, and that there was no problem.  That was the salient points of his speech.  He was, in fact, denying the fact that the Interahamwe were killing people.  He was saying it is not the Interahamwe.  "Where are they?"  That is what he said.
Q.	Do you recall what Mathieu Ngirumpatse said? 
A.	Chairman Mathieu concurred with him but with a slight difference.  He stated that the Interahamwe were at the war front, with the soldiers combatting the enemy.  So one should not say that our Interahamwe are perpetrating killings, are killing your colleagues or your people.  He even added what follows:  "Why couldn't it be the JDR or the Abakombozi, wearing the uniforms of our Interahamwe, who would be perpetrating killings and killing your people in order to make people believe that they are Interahamwe?"  So, as you can see, he was saying the same thing, with a slight nuance.  The speeches were complementing one another.

1700H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.  	Did any of these national authorities disagree with each other on anything during the course of that meeting?  
A.	No.  Every time someone would take the floor, there was applause.  Whoever was speaking was being applauded.  I am referring to the politicians who were there; who were happy.  We could see them laughing.  No one did anything to support me or try to reach a consensus, and it is the reason for which when Mugenzi said that the préfet was to be dismissed as well as the bourgmestres, he did not understand the current policy, I decided to leave the room and I did not go back there.  I left them there in the room with the prime minister. 
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Witness.  

Did you understand from what the -- what did you understand from these national authorities?  Did they expect or want the bourgmestres to do with the Interahamwe or for the Interahamwe? 
A.	To my mind, the authorities confirmed that what was being done, that is to say the killings perpetrated in Gitarama were not illegal -- were not an offence.  Had it been the case, there would have been discussions.  And subsequently, they did not take all these acts into account.  I also said that the Interahamwe were perpetrating illegal acts, but they were saying that even if there were people wearing Interahamwe uniforms, they were not Interahamwe, they were rather people, who under -- wearing the uniforms of the Interahamwe, who were perpetrating illegal acts.  And they were saying that the Interahamwe were at the warfront and that they were fighting the enemy.  

In fact, I went out there empty handed because they sabotaged me and it was as if -- as far as I was concerned, I was not able to reach my objectives and I failed.  

In addition, they really demoralised the bourgmestres and that was obvious, because from the 18th onwards, large scale killings started in Gitarama.  From the 18th up until the 28th.  If you go to Gitarama and you conduct investigations, you will note that 80 per cent of the killings perpetrated took place during that period.  As a consequence, that meeting was, in fact, what launched the killings in that region. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  

Returning to your response that after that meeting, there were large scale killings in Gitarama, would you be able to identify who among the bourgmestres were so influenced by the events of that meeting that their conduct or their behaviour changed as a result?  We don't necessarily have to go name by name again, but reflecting on the period after the 18th, can you illustrate what you just said by speaking about specific bourgmestres who changed their behaviour as a result of the message they received on the 18th of April? 
A.	There were several.  I begin with the bourgmestres who committed murder.  I am ready to state here before the Court that I can testify against these people should the occasion arise, when the time comes.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness mentioned a name that escaped the interpreter.
THE WITNESS:  
He went to kill someone near Nyanza, a businessman.  I intervened and investigated in-depth, so I have proof.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we didn't have the name of the person you were referring talking about.  Tell us who you are referring to.  
A.	Celestin.  The bourgmestre of Kigoma, Ugirashebuja -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I don't know if it's on the spelling list.  
THE WITNESS:  
He committed many crimes.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Let me clarify something for the record.  Ugirashebuja is number 79 on our spelling list and he also appeared on the list of bourgmestres at number 16. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  Go on with your response please.  
A.	What I can tell you is that some were very quickly sacked.  That had impact on morale of other bourgmestres, so that the reports that they would regularly give me stopped.  They didn't come to see me anymore.  They didn't send me reports anymore.  When I had that people had been killed, I would have to intervene personally.  But what I might say -- I would say that the administration fell apart.  

In my view, the government was indulging in a methodic tactic.  And I am weighing my words and I assume full responsibility for them.  It was their deliberate policy. 
Q.	What was "their deliberate policy" or "methodical policy"? 
A.	What was methodical was deliberate.  It was the way they systematically acted in such a way, and when you analyse it, you see that it was systematic, methodical.  First of all, after that meeting, very swiftly they set up civil self-defence.  It was called national auto self-defence.  System.  Well, you see what that means, you take civilians and you make a structure that receives weapons, guns and they killed civilians.  Those civilians came to reinforce the Interahamwe in killing the Tutsis.  That is very well-known.  Methodically, you programme an action and then you follow through with it.  They destabilise the commune, they distributed fire arms, people -- young people were trained in the use of firearms and there was genocide, otherwise there wouldn't have been so many deaths.  We lost more than 80,000 people in ten days.  Even if I don't all the statistics, but everybody understands that there was a target. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  

I would like to go into the issue of civil defence a bit more, but before we get to that point, let's just complete your response on the issue of which bourgmestres changed as a result of the meeting of the 18th of April.  If I ask you about Akayesu, can you tell me if he --  
A.	For sure, Akayesu, before, he was a good man.  A person with good morals and who was seen in a bad light.  Because of that -- but after that date, he never came to see me anymore.  And I know that his commune lost more than 30,000 people, and he doesn't come to speak to the préfet.  What do you think of that?   While the préfet was still in office.  That means that something else was going on.  That's how it went.  They killed and then they hide from the préfet what was happening.  And you know that people have been saying that he is an accomplice. 
Q.	With respect to the bourgmestre of ****************************************, did his behaviour change from one period to the next? 
A.	No, he continued to report to me.  I think two of his conseillers were murdered and he continued giving -- reporting to me saying that the Interahamwe were becoming harder and -- harder to deal with.  One day he tells me that they killed such and such a conseiller.  And then another day he reports that they have killed another one, and then one day he tells he wants to flee because his wife is Tutsi.  He lived in front of the military camp and he told me that soldiers were around his house and he told me that he planned to go to his home commune in Mpushi, near Kivumu.   At one point, he took all his family and moved out.  But I think he continued to come to see me just as there were other bourgmestres who came to ask me to intervene.  When the appropriate moment arrives, we will speak of them, but there were not numerous.  Most bourgmestres decided to break with me.  Some of them even killed people.  I will give you the example of the bourgmestre of Murama, Rutiganda, Jean-Damascène.  He killed people.  At the market place at Muhanda (sic), himself, he shot people down.  I intervened.  He came to seek refuge in Nyanza.  Again he attacked the pastors at Gitwe.  He is the one who led that attack.  I intervened and I was told that he was leading them.  That is the truth.  If these people were to be tried, I will testify against those people that killed other people. 
Q.	Would you be able to identify, based on your experience, (inaudible) contact with, which of the bourgmestres made genuine attempts to maintain security as distinct from those that participated in the killings?   Would you be able to provide that information based on the information that you received at the time? 
A.	Yes, I can provide you with examples.  Shall we go through it commune by commune?  
Q.	Very quickly.  Tell us which ones, based on your observations, genuinely attempted to maintain security, and which ones joined the government programme and conducted the killings?   You don't have to give us examples now, but tell us what you -- the information that you received? 
A.	Let's take the bourgmestre of Masongo, Niyemukiza Louis, number 3.  He did all he could because he and his policeman resisted the people that came from Gwakira. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
  I think the witness -- 
THE WITNESS:  
He resisted Esdras and his Interahamwe.  He was an old man.  He was retired, and the bourgmestre resisted Mpamo and his son.  There was someone else who tried, Dagizimana, Callixte, number 4.  He was subsequently killed and the bourgmestre Mukingi, he hit many people and asked me to intervene.  Colonel Simba had attacked and four people were killed at the communal office.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Okay, we've gone through three.  Continue, but go a little bit slower? 
A.	I start now.  And then the bourgmestre, Masongo, that was Nizeyumukiza, number 3, he resisted the Interahamwe led by Mpamo and those that came from Gwakira.  He was sacked, as a result, and replaced by someone from the Power wing.  Ndagijimana Callixte, Mugina commune, number 4, publicly resisted the Interahamwe and was killed for his pains.  In fact, he was trying to protect the Tutsi who sought refuge with him and he was killed and after his funeral they attacked the refugees who had sought refuge for them, about 600 people, and we buried them in April.  After they were killed, I personally intervened.  I had the corpses buried and those who were wounded, I took to the hospital, but later they were, in a dignified way, re-interred.  
Q.	What about Basil Nsabimana? 
A.	From Mukinge, number 5.  He also behaved very well.  I don't know where he is.  He could come home.  He hasn't got any problem.  I know that he is seen in a good light.  And then there was Nyandwi, Justine, from Musambira.  That is number 7.  He resisted the Abdalahman Interahamwe and was sacked for his pains and was replaced by CDR -- a CDR member, the son of Namba -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
I think he said a worthless fellow.  
THE WITNESS:  
And number 13, Rukiramacumu, Jean-Pierre, from Nyakibanda, that bourgmestre also resisted the Interahamwe.  And that is the commune where the killing came later in May, with the exception of the killing committed by the lieutenant of which I spoke before.  And then the killing only began after Rukiramacumu was sacked.  Another one resisted the Interahamwe and that is number 14, Rutobwe commune, Mporanzi, Jean-Marie, a good chap, he is at home, a teacher.  He's got no problem.  As for the rest of them, they were Interahamwe. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And just for the clarity of the record, let's go back to number 1 from Nyamabuye.  Is he someone that resisted the killings or not? 
A.	Yes, didn't I mention him?  
Q.	We did, but we went over him very briefly.  

Okay.  With the exception of those that you've just mentioned, the others adopted the government programme afterwards.  Is that your testimony?  
A.	Absolutely.  There are some of them that even killed with their own hands.  Someone comes with a gun and firearm.  And shoots at people.  Others encouraged the killings.  You must understand that's how it was.  
Q.	Now those that you mentioned that had gotten sacked, how were they sacked?  Who caused them to be sacked?  Do you know what the procedure was for removing them from office?  
A.  	No, I can't say.  You'd hear a communiqué saying that such and such was sacked; the bourgmestre was sacked; a sub préfet; even several other sub préfets were sacked.  That is why I say it was systematic and methodical.  And that is part of it when you sack civil servants and replaced them by people who are in favour of the killings, it must be premeditated, whether it is the campaign for sensitising, promoting awareness, when your pretext is there is a war and you do such things.  I don't want to indulge in politics here, but in my view I don't think you can use the pretext of a war to kill normal citizens.  You can't do that.  Maybe you could wage a war to protect your citizens, but you cannot kill ordinary citizens under the pretext that there is a war.  I will not agree with that sort of a war? 
Q.	There was a bourgmestre; I believe you've identified him before, Gasana -- not a bourgmestre, but a sub préfet.  Do you know if Gasana was ever replaced and why?  
A.  	Gasana was replaced very quickly because he was a Tutsi, first of all, and because he was a PL candidate for parliament.  He was in the Landouald wing.  He was a candidate, MP, according to Arusha Accords.  I think he was sacked for those two reasons.  He was a potential politician and be cause he was a Tutsi. 
Q.	Who replaced him? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I think we missed your (inaudible), Counsel 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Who replaced Gasana as sous-préfet?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Please, could you repeat for the court records because it was cut by the microphone?  
BY MR. WEBSTER:  
Q.  	I'm sorry; let me repeat my question before you respond, Mr. Witness.  

Do you know who replaced Gasana as sous-préfet? 
A.	Yes, I do know who replaced him. 
Q.	Tell us who that person is? 
A.	His name was Rutegisha. 
Q.	Would that be Misago, Antoine?  
A.	Yes, indeed, Misago Rutegisha, who was second vice president, national vice president -- vice chairman in the CDR party, and he was member of that party's steering committee.  Before he was a normal civil servant in the ministry of health.  He was the head of a division in that ministry, and then he was appointed sous préfet to replace Gasana.  Maybe they wanted to ensure some sort of balance because this CDR -- there weren't many politicians from the CDR party and it was to strengthen that party which was a fraternal party to the other. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I am taking note of the time and I am also looking at my outline and the pretrial brief, summary for this witness's testimony and there are, at least, two more lines of questioning that I have to go into and I don't think we could do that simply by extending the Court session for an hour or so.  So my preference would be for us to finish this witness's testimony tomorrow.  But certainly it wouldn't go beyond the 12:30 --  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
I beg your pardon.  
MR. WEBSTER:  
I said that I am certain that we will not go beyond 12:30 tomorrow if we -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
That is the worst-case scenario.  What is the best-case scenario?  
MR. WEBSTER:  
The best case scenario is that the mid morning break, if we start by 9 o'clock, I would think that by 10:30, we would finish.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
So you think you have two and half hours more? 
MR. WEBSTER:  
Is that two and half hours?  No, an hour and half, because if we start at 9:00 -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
You have an hour and half?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  

Madam Registrar, what can you -- describe the progress up to date.  
MS. N'GUM:  
The Prosecution has utilised four hours fifty-six minutes today, and when I look at Witness FH, utilised six hours ten minutes.  So he, at least, has some time. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I think we should keep this registry assistant with us.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Yes, I do, but I wouldn't have preferred to use Witness FH as a standard for Prosecution examination-in-chief.  

Anyway, thank you, Madam Registrar.  

Mr. Witness, it's clear that you will have to come back tomorrow to continue your examination-in-chief.  So we take the adjournment now.  As I told you earlier today, during this or any adjournment during your testimony, you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  

We take the adjournment now until tomorrow morning.  

Yes, I am sorry; you wish to say something.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I should like to ask if you could do whatever possible to put questions so that we might progress, move forward because I have work waiting for me.  You see, I've been here for nearly a week and I am an MP.  With the -- the parliament is sitting at the moment and the ministry delegated me to that session of parliament -- to the economic commission of the MPs.  If it ceases sitting because of me and the work is delayed because of me, that will not be a good thing.  We have destroyed.  There are very few civil servants to undertake this work.  So I should like to ask that we could proceed expeditiously so that I might go and take care of those other matters.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Mr. Witness, I think you have under estimated what is happening.  The -- we have to give the Prosecutor freedom to complete his examination-in-chief and we don't sit on the weekends.  Now, he has undertaken to complete his examination tomorrow morning.  When that is completed, we will adjourn and resume on Monday.  And as a general standard in terms of the ratio between examination-in-chief and cross-examination, there is usually an equality, and as there are three accused persons, if the total examination takes about 15 hours, about five hours, as she has suggested, or six, then you estimate approximately 15 hours in cross-examination.  So that is three -- the rough type of estimate which we will consider to be reasonable.  I'm sure that is what it looks like.  

We take our adjournment now.
