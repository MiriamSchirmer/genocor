MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.  

Madam registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MS. NTILATWA:
Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, Presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short and -- and Judge Gberbao G. Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Monday, 15th May 2006 for resumption of trial in the matter of the Prosecution versus Karemera, et al, Case Number ICTR 98-44-T; please, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Madam registrar.  

What I think I should just recall is that pursuant to information communicated this morning, we are sitting under Rule 15 bis in the absence of Judge Kam, who will be joining us tomorrow morning.

As we are about to start the proceedings, I think we should just, again, have appearances on the record, please, Mr. Prosecutor.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
The appearances remain the same: Don Webster as lead counsel, assisted by Gilles Lahai,         Alayne Frankson-Wallace, Sunkarie Ballah-Conteh, Takeh Sendze and Elizabeth Dwomoh, who is our legal researcher.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I am Chantel Hounkpatin, lead counsel for Mathieu Ngirumpatse, assisted by Counsel Anta Guisse, who is my legal assistant.  

I believe that my learned counsel, Felix Sow -- my learned colleague, Felix Sow, is held up somehow.  He should be here in a short while with his assistant.  And I believe that they are attending to some administrative issues.  
MR. NIMY:
Joseph Patrick Nimy, co-counsel for Peter Robinson, lead counsel for Joseph Nzirorera; our legal assistant is Daniel Ntawumenyumunsi.  

Thank you, Mr. President. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
I notice that Mr. Karemera is on his own. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
At least temporarily. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President, I would ask that we not commence without his being represented.  I'm sure          Mr. Sow can be here -- should be here momentarily.  I see his assistant, so perhaps it won't be long.  But as a matter of principle -- he has arrived.  
MR. SOW: 
Good afternoon, Mr. President.  I would like to tender my apologies. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Sow.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I was under the impression that we were resuming at 14h30, but it would seem that it was 2 p.m., and I am, indeed, quite sorry about this. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, Mr. Sow, we accept your apologies.  You are not in the habit of being late and we understand that today is first day.  

What we were discussing privately was, perhaps, somewhat slightly humourous, that we had noticed at the last trial session that Accused Karemera had been providing a lot of assistance concerning legal tomes.  And when you -- so, we just wondered whether -- after Mr. Robinson had raised a question about him proceeding -- about proceeding in your absence, we were just discussing his own capability as a legal representative in this context.  But now everybody is here, we can now resume our sitting.

Mr. Webster, are you ready?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes.  Your Honour, the Prosecution is calling Witness ZF to the stand.  ZF is a protected witness.  I would like to conduct the first portion of my direct examination in closed session.  What I plan to do is to spend, perhaps, a half hour or so going over relationships that ZF had with other significant personalities in this case, and his place of employment and his living situation, all of which is likely to disclose his identity.  So, for that reason I would request that the Court move into closed session and that we spend a significant period of time in closed session to thrash out those relationships.  And then we can resume in open session for the bulk of his testimony.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President, prior to doing that I would like to make a motion to withdraw the pseudonym for Witness ZF, and to have him testify without a pseudonym under his true name.  And the reason for that is that the established jurisprudence says that, when witnesses have protective measures, they must have a real fear for their safety or that of their family.  And also, there must be an objective justification for this fear, and that measures of protection of witnesses should be granted on a case-by-case basis, not on the general situation in Rwanda or the region.  And that it is on the burden of the moving party to clearly delineate the dangers that the witness faces and the situation that warrants the protective measures. 

So, I don't believe that any of that has been done.  And the Prosecution has not met its burden of showing why this witness cannot testify under his name.  

In the Milosevic case, the Trial Chamber refused to extend protective measures to an employee of a humanitarian agency absent the showing of an extraordinary risk to the safety of the witness or his or her family.  With respect to this particular witness, Witness ZF, he was neither a participant in any crimes in Rwanda during the events of 1994, nor was he a survivor or victim of any crimes.  So he stands in a very -- in a unique position as to other witnesses that are being called in this case and who have received protective measures.  And I don't know of any reason why this witness should have to fear from the Defence.  He has testified before in the *********************************************************
****************** 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I would object to the reference of this witness testifying in other case.  That, in and of itself, is a violation of the protective order.  So, this is the very reason why I think we should be doing this in closed session.  There should be no reference to any prior case that this witness may have been involved in. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, the witness **************************************************************************
**************************************************************
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, one of the problems with the submission that you are making now is that we are not currently considering whether to grant protection to this witness.  He is already the beneficiary of an order.  And at the moment, we are simply enforcing an order which already exists. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
And I'm asking you to reconsider as to this particular witness because when you made your order you had no information whatsoever concerning this particular witness.  You made a blanket order concerning all witnesses, but that we have been through this before with, I think, every witness that has testified.  And, again, my position is that the witness should be required to state the specific objective facts which make him feel some fear or justify the protective measures.  

So that is my submission, and it is my motion that the witness -- the protective measures for this witness be lifted only to the extent that the pseudonym be cancelled and that he give the testimony in his true name.  Thank you. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, why are you making this application just when the witness gets into the box?  You were aware of the earlier protective measures which cover -- covers this witness and many other witnesses.  Why do you choose to make this application at this particular juncture?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Because I am asking you to make enquiring -- I want, first of all, because I want the witness to hear the motion, and hear what I say about it.  And I want you to make an enquiry of the witness when he is first here and arrives as to the specifics of why he feels he needs protection, so there is -- there is nothing to be decided in advance until you have heard the witness concerning the actual, individual reasons why this witness feels he needs protection, and whether those are objectively reasonable. 
JUDGE SHORT:
What you are asking us to do is to review our earlier order. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Just to the extent that you have never actually decided on the circumstances of this particular witness.  You have just decided, in general, for the pre-trial stage of the case that the witnesses have protective measures, meaning that the Prosecutor can refer to them by pseudonym, we are limited in our disclosure during the investigation.  But now the witness is here.  He is ready the give testimony.  And you have never had any information that would justify extending the protective order to the witness's testimony under a pseudonym. 
JUDGE SHORT:
But the earlier order was made on grounds which were advanced by the Prosecution, right.
 MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, but they were very general.  They were simply that the situation in Rwanda is such that people should have pseudonyms.  But the case law requires that you do that on an individual basis.  And this is -- when the witness comes, this is the opportunity for you to find out what it is about this particular witness that would require those measures.  We have protective measures for virtually every witness.  And it is our position that that is not correct unless it is justified in each particular circumstance.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, I would like to respond, Your Honour, but I would like to respond in closed session since we are going into this -- the very subject matter that needs to be protected, I think it should be done in closed session.  This is not appropriate for an open session discussion. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will go into closed session.  

For the benefit of the members of the public, many of the witnesses who testify in these -- in these proceedings have had orders made for the concealment of their identity from the public.  The issue of the order made in relation to this witness is presently being discussed and -- (inaudible)

1445H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, can you hear me?   
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can hear you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What language are you going to give your evidence in?  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
In French, okay.  Now, the rules of our procedure here require that you take an oath to tell the truth during your testimony.  And the registrar will now administer that oath to you. 
MR. MJUI:
Witness, kindly stand up. 
(Declaration made by the Witness ZF in French)
MR. ROBINSON: 
I think we can accept that is being an application to speak the truth.  But while we are in open session, if I can just take one more moment and that is to make a quick application for certification to appeal the decision in which you refused to consider making enquiry of the witness with respect to his protective measures.  Pursuant to Rule 72(B), we feel that this meets both qualifications for certification.  

First, the witness -- whether a witness testifies with a pseudonym or in public affects the fair trial rights of the Accused, because witnesses who testify in public have their testimony available so people who hear about that testimony can contact the Chamber, the Prosecutor or the Defence and can alert us if there is something that is not true about that testimony.  And that happened with the only witness that has testified so far in this trial, Mr.***********.  We received a letter telling us that he was not being truthful and giving us names of people to contact based on someone hearing his testimony and knowing that he -- who he was.  

So, we feel that is an issue that affects the fairness of the trial.  

And also that the immediate resolution by the Appeals Chamber would materially advance the proceedings because, obviously, this is going to happen with many, many witnesses during the course of this trial.  And it is a controversial issue.  The question is very simple, whether or not you have to have specific information for a particular witness before you can grant protective measures such as testifying by a pseudonym at a trial.  And that is an issue, I believe, that if it was resolved by the Appeals Chamber before the end of the trial would have an impact on the proceedings by it being able to correct that if, in fact, it is found to not be a valid practice.  So, I ask that you grant us certification to appeal the ruling, the oral ruling that you made in closed session a few minutes ago. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any other submission on this matter, from either side?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
The Prosecution opposes the motion, Your Honour.  I don't think I have to give a detailed response.  I am a bit concerned though, because -- not so much about this question to certify, but the way in which it was moved forward with the reference to a witness who testified previously.  

Now, I think it is incumbent upon this Trial Chamber to set the tone for the rest of the proceeding.  That comment was gratuitous.  It was almost as if Mr. Robinson himself was testifying about the credibility of a witness that testified before this Court, and it is inappropriate.  And I object to that.  

And I would prefer not to object when comments like that are made, and they have been quite often, and usually I jump to my feet, and I would prefer not to have to do that.  And so I can ignore them and have things go much more quickly.  But I think it would be more appropriate for the Court to set the tone and direct Mr. Robinson to refrain from making gratuitous comments about the witnesses that testify before us.  So, I oppose the application and I would like to proceed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are there any other submissions on this issue?  Okay -- sorry.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I would like to support the motion by my colleague, Robinson, as well as the application for certification to appeal.  I believe that it is important that witnesses appearing in this case, although benefiting from protective measures, as may have been the case for this witness four years ago, it is important that we revisit those measures, because this is an important trial.  One has the impression that everything is being done behind the scenes, behind the screens, and the people who come to testify are not ready to face reality; whereas the Accused persons are there, facing their accusations directly whereas those who accuse them are in the shadows.  It is, therefore, quite important that with all of this time that has gone by, they too -- that is the witnesses, should also be in a position to confront the realities that the Accused persons are facing.  And that is why I support this application for certification because the Prosecution will call 80 or more witnesses.  And they will all appear in closed session, faceless, and without any pictures of them to show, and that would be very unfortunate for the trial.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  There being no other submissions, we will indicate our ruling shortly, not today, maybe tomorrow morning.  

In the meantime, we will proceed with the testimony of the witness.  We resume in closed session now.
