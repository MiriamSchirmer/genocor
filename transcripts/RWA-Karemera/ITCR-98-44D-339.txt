MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody. 

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please?  
MR. KOUAMBO-TCHINDA:
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, the 30th of August, 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of

CYPRIEN NGENDAHIMANA,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued) 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning, madam. 
Q.	Thursday we left off when you were explaining to the Court that you observed that the government had relocated in Murambi, that there was disorder, that the various services of this government was not operating correctly.  Is that the case? 
A.	Yes, that is the case. 
Q.	This morning we are going to continue.  We are going to deal with two different aspects, and I would like to know if, at one time or the other, you had to go back to Kigali following you taking refuge in Gitarama? 
A.	Yes.  I went back some weeks later. 
Q.	Please tell the Chamber approximately at what date you went there and what took you back to Kigali.  Was it for personal problems, or was it for professional reasons?  Please explain that.  Please pause before you answer.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I cannot recall the exact dates, but I believe this was in mid-May when I had to go back to Kigali, the capital.  This was upon the request of my colleagues who were working with me in Murambi.  I had to go for some items that we needed in Gitarama. 
Q.	Please describe to the Chamber the conditions under which you travelled to Gitarama -- to Kigali.  Did you have to go through roadblocks?  Give us an idea of this trip between Gitarama and Kigali.  
A.	Let me say that from Gitarama to Nyabarongo, I had -- I did not have much problem.  The roadblocks were normal.  But when I was entering the capital, I realised that tension was high, and I realised that even when I got to Muhima where I met -- where I saw a roadblock, what surprised me at that point was that instead of asking me for my identity card -- as was the practice all along from Gitarama -- there they asked me for my work -- or, my professional card, my professional ID, which I showed to them.  And one of the persons manning that roadblock said, "Very well.  We see you are a journalist.  You have studied.  That is true.  But what I would tell you is that now people who have studied too much are not those who wield influence.  Those wielding influence are those carrying weapons."  

There was a soldier who was accompanying me and who intervened and asked them why all these questions, because he -- and told them that the person -- "You asked the person to show you his identity card and he has done so, so why are you pursuing with all these questions?"  So finally they let me go through the roadblock and I went to the plateau where the office of the national radio station is located.
Q.	Are you able to clarify certain things for the Court?  You said -- or, when you left Gitarama, were you alone or in a team? 
A.	We were in a team of two journalists and one soldier. 
Q.	So the check that was done at that roadblock involved the two journalists and the soldier.  Was the soldier identifiable by his uniform or he was not identifiable for him to be able to intervene the way he did? 
A.	No.  He was wearing civilian clothes, and that is why it took those manning the roadblock some time to identify him.  In fact, he had to identify himself, otherwise he would have suffered the same fate as we did from those manning the roadblock. 
Q.	At what time did you arrive in Kigali? 
A.	I believe I got to Kigali around -- between ten and nine. 
Q.	You got to the office of the ORINFOR.  What happened?  What was the environment there?  How did things happen at ORINFOR at that time or on that day? 
A.	When I got to ORINFOR, I realised that a lot had changed.  First of all, there were fewer staff members than previously.  I also realised that the work environment had completely changed.  I had to make some trips to town.  We managed to get to the central market.  And what I was able to observe there was that the nature of the war was changing.  People were saying that there were two separate wars.  There was a war against armed troops and there was a war against bandits. 
Q.	Can you be clearer when you say that there was a war against soldiers and a war against the bandits?  Can you give examples to illustrate this observation? 
A.	I can illustrate that by giving you this example that I observed personally at the central market:  There I saw a group of soldiers who was with the préfet of the town, who was also a soldier, who ordered them to shoot all those looting.  And everywhere we saw young people running, holding a lot of things, carrying things on their heads.  So it was a mix of war and looting. 
MR. SENDZE:
Excuse me, could we have the name of the préfet, please?
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, are you able to tell -- to give the name of the préfet? 
A.	Yes.  It was Tharcisse Renzaho. 
Q.	Thank you.  And are you able to say at what time you left the town and whether the trip back happened normally? 
A.	My day in the city was a catastrophic one.  While we were visiting the central market, we had to leave because there was intense shelling and we had to go back to the radio station.  And I recall that I went to the studio very quickly, because those who were working there were just maintenance technicians.  And while we were talking, a shell dropped on the radio station and I had to go down to the ground floor because I realised that the shelling was becoming intense. 

Then when I got to the ground floor I had met my colleague, who worked at the TV station, who came to see whether there were some provisions at the radio station.  When we left each other, the shelling continued.  Luckily there was a period during which we could say it was calm, and that was when my colleague left and went back to the television station.  After that I tried to follow him to see what was happening at the television station.  

When I got to the American embassy, a shell exploded at the préfecture office and another one exploded at the television station, so I had to turn back immediately.  So I went back once again to the radio station very scared, because what was happening was going to be a repeat of what happened when I left Kigali.  

After the two explosions, the one that happened at the préfecture and the one that happened at the radio station -- at the television station, there was a bit of calm.  And during that period I went to see the driver who was also at the station, and I said we should do everything possible to be able to go back to Gitarama because things were not normal in Kigali. 

And since the shelling -- since there was a lull in the shelling, I went to the radio -- television station once again.  And while I was there I observed something very horrific.  The colleague I was referring to had been killed by one of the explosions that I referred to.  We had to go through the hospital.  When we tried once again to use the Nyabugogo Road, we were told that it was no longer possible and we had to take a detour through Butamwa to get to Gitarama. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Do you know Setiba? 
A.	Yes.  I know Setiba very well. 
Q.	Could you tell the Court the circumstances in which you got to know Setiba, please?  To be more specific, I am referring to Joseph Setiba.  Could you explain to the Court your relationship with him? 
A.	Setiba is my cousin.  He is like a cousin in the extended African family context.  We grew up together.  We lived together in our commune -- in our secteur in the same commune and cellule, and we also grew up together in Kigali, the capital.  We lived together in Kigali, both of us. 
Q.	Could you be more specific as to your commune, in the commune in which you lived together? 
A.	We lived together in Rushashi, our native commune, the same secteur as Minazi and even in the same cellule. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you describe Joseph Setiba, his personality, to the Court and also tell us the reason for which he left his native area? 
A.	Setiba was known in the region and capital as a great bandit.  He engaged in these con activities and fraud, even from his very early age.  He had been arrested by the population when he stole a goat.  I do remember that he was caught red-handed with the goat in the forest by the communal police.  It is something that I experienced.  I was present at that incident myself.  And from that time on he never returned to his native area. 
Q.	What activities did he undertake in Kigali?  And are you aware or not whether he was in prison at some point in time? 
A.	I know that he was imprisoned several times and that he was released when granted a presidential pardon, and yet his activities -- his fraudulent activities did not come to an end as such. 
Q.	Could you tell the Court how frequently you met him until 1994 and also whether you met him after 1994? 
A.	I met him often in Kigali, and I do recall that one day in 1992, if I am not mistaken, we went to bury my grandmother, who had died, together.  So there were several occasions on which we could have met.  I knew where he lived.  He knew my home.  And as members of the same family, it was possible for us to meet from time to time and share news about the family. 

Although he was known to be a thief or a fraudster, we still interacted and talked about news from our area and our family.  He used to live at Giticyinyoni where his house was located.  That was on the way into the capital city, and he was, therefore, in a position to meet many people from our area.  

It was also possible for him to invite me to his home.  And I do recall a day in which he was hosting a senior civil servant, a state civil servant and he called me when I was just wrapping up my sports programme on the radio.  He asked me to come to his home saying that he had good news for me. 

When I got there, he told me to wait.  And when the senior civil servant had left, he told me that he simply had called me in order to show that senior civil servant that he was not the only one visiting him, but that there were other dignitaries like myself who would also visit him from time to time.  And that is how he informed me that those people actually come to him to look or seek for powers, powers and -- traditional powers to be able to progress in their positions or duties. 
Q.	So my understanding is that Setiba was involved in witchcraft.  Was he a traditional doctor?  
A.	Well, yes.  He used that as a screen to engage in his other fraudulent activities.  
Q.	Do you know whether at some point in time Joseph Setiba was controlling those manning a roadblock in April 1994? 
A.	Yes.  Setiba had his own roadblock at Giticyinyoni which he controlled.  There was no soldier at that roadblock.  I do recall going through that roadblock on my way to Gitarama for the first time.  The roadblock was still there when I came back from Gitarama.  Except that on the day I was returning, I did not see Setiba.  We asked for him, and we were told that he had taken some armed persons with him to fight the enemy.  That is the information I got when I returned to Gitarama. 
Q.	As far as you know, was Setiba one of the leaders of the gangsters who were terrorising Kigali? 
A.	Yes, I can confirm that.  As I stated earlier, as the days went on, the bandits and crooks and swindlers took increasing control over things, not to fight for the state, but, rather, to defend their own personal interests.  That is why I can say that Setiba knew many of those crooks and was, therefore, able to set up a very efficient roadblock. 
Q.	Do you know whether Joseph Setiba was a member of any political party?  Was he a leader of any political party? 
A.	I don't know.  He never mentioned that he was a leader of any political party. 
Q.	Do you know whether Joseph Setiba was Mathieu Ngirumpatse's friend? 
A.	I have described him already.  And as far as I am concerned, it would have been impossible for Setiba to be Mathieu Ngirumpatse's friend because of his reputation.  And going by that alone, I do not see how any relationship could have been established between him and Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  I don't see that as possible. 
Q.	If Joseph Setiba were to claim that he is Mathieu Ngirumpatse's friend, would that have been simply to increase his reputation, mindful of your knowledge of Joseph Setiba?  Would that have been the case? 
A.	As I testified earlier on, even regarding my own personality, when he introduced me to that senior civil servant, he was bragging about it and saying that it is not only people of his status who came to visit him, so he may have also mentioned Mathieu Ngirumpatse as one of those who he was connected to.  And so he may have used that as well to say, in the same manner as he did for me, calling me to invite him, that, yes, it is the kind of political connections he had.  So -- but in my case, for example, he simply was using me to show off to somebody who was, in fact, a victim of his crookery. 
Q.	Along the same lines and still in connection to Setiba's activities, fraudulent activities, would it have been possible for him to receive any instructions and orders from the leaders or authorities of the country? 
A.	I think it would have been impossible, impossible for someone with his kind of reputation.  And although he lived in Kigali, many people knew that he had been imprisoned for a very long time, and, therefore, I would be surprised that he would have connections with a leader or a figure of authority to the extent where such a person would confide in him. 
Q.	When did you leave Gitarama? 
A.	Towards the end of May.  I left Gitarama towards the end of May. 
Q.	For what reasons did you leave Gitarama?  And could you be more specific as to the date.  Was it late May or early June, as you try to jog your memory?  And remember the events and the dates, please.  
A.	Regarding the dates -- and to be honest with you, I cannot provide an exact date, but it must have been towards the end -- or, towards the beginning of the month of June.  

The reasons for which I left Gitarama were as follows:  Gitarama had become a centre of interest.  Many people were coming into Gitarama.  The war was coming closer to Gitarama.  And having experienced the war myself, I didn't want to find myself in a situation where I would experience the direct consequences of war again, and it is for that reason that I left Gitarama. 
Q.	I would like to put a question to you for clarification regarding Joseph Setiba before we move on to your departure from Gitarama.  Now, did you see Joseph Setiba in Gitarama? 
A.	No, I never saw him at Gitarama. 
Q.	Did you ever hear that he came to Gitarama to meet the authorities? 
A.	Honestly, I never heard any mention of Gitarama -- of Setiba in Gitarama. 
Q.	But at least you heard mention of his criminal acts or his misdeeds, didn't you? 
A.	Yes.  Everybody talked about him.  All those who came to Gitarama talked about him.  And it was not possible to come to Gitarama without talking about his roadblock at Giticyinyoni, which I already mentioned, and that was at the very entrance or exit from the capital.  So anybody coming to Gitarama went through that roadblock, and all said that they were quite surprised that someone who was known to be a civilian was wearing military gear and that he was surrounded by other persons.  This is what I also observed myself when he met me in Gitarama -- no, rather, in Gisenyi. 

You see, when I left Gitarama I went to Gisenyi and I noticed that while there was disorder and people were running all over the place, I met Setiba in Gisenyi clad in a colonel's uniform, and I was surprised to be sitting with a colonel.  And as Setiba greeted me, I was sitting with another colonel, and he asked me whether I knew the colonel who had just greeted me.  And -- so he asked me, "Do you know this colonel?"  And then I turned to him and I said, "You are a colonel and he is a colonel.  Am I in a good position to know -- or, in a better position than you to know your colleague?"  And he insisted.  He wanted to find out.  And so I felt that this was a dangerous situation, but I went on to say, "This is Setiba."  And that colonel was surprised to see Setiba in military uniform, the uniform of a colonel at that.
Q.	Following that example you have just referred to, and given that you are a journalist, how would you describe the situation obtaining in the country at that time? 
A.	Well, the RPF was increasing pressure on the national forces, and that pressure was more and more intense.  People were increasingly frightened and did not know what to do in that situation.  My observation then was that it is those who were able to overcome their fears who had power because they could stand the rumblings of the gunfire and were able to stand up to everything in spite of all the chaos.
Q.	(Microphone not activated)
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	My microphone was not switched off (sic), but let me just say to you, Mr. Witness, thank you for answering all my questions.  
A.	Thank you, madam. 

MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Registrar, please, how much time did we take?  
MR. KOUAMBO-TCHINDA:
Thank you, Counsel.  Two hours and three minutes.  Thank you. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Hounkpatin.  

Ms. Diagne, do you have any questions of this witness?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, the questions and answers were in French and I took off my headset for a while and I did not hear your question.  Mr. President, would you kindly repeat your question for my benefit, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I was trying to give you an opportunity to put questions to the witness, if you wish to exercise it. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I have no questions for this witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Mr. Witness, you are now going to have to respond to the Prosecutor who will have an opportunity to cross-examine you. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. SENDZE: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Honourable Judges and dear colleagues of the Defence.
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, my name is Takeh Sendze and I am an officer representing the Prosecutor.  I have a few questions for you in relation to your testimony. 

Now, you testified that you know Mr. Ngirumpatse very well; is that true? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Apart from striving to be as educated as Mr. Ngirumpatse, and the fact that you and he hail from the same préfecture, and the fact that you met him in Congo, in addition to the fact that you know that he is a leader -- or, he was a leader of a choir, are there any other circumstances in which you have known or met Mr. Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Yes.  I know him because, apart from his religious activities, he was a politician.  I have already testified that he served the state in various capacities -- such as, ambassador, minister and chairman or president of the MRND party. 
Q.	Before the time when you met him in Congo, had you ever had a conversation with Mr. Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Well, I cannot say that I had any deep discussions with him before.  We met and greeted casually as natives from the same area, but I never really sat down with him to have an in-depth discussion on any topic. 
Q.	So you would not know Mr. Ngirumpatse's political or social philosophies because you never talked to him.  All you know about him is what you saw or observed from a distance; am I correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	You, therefore, are not really in a very good position to talk about his personality in the clear terms that you did when you testified in direct; do you agree? 
A.	As I have already testified, I mentioned the circumstances in which I got to know him, his social life, his political life.  And I think that I gave a clear explanation as to all that. 
Q.	You testified that from the 6th of April to the 12th of April you moved around the town of Kigali, back and forth between your home and your office, correct? 
A.	Not between the 6th and 12th, Mr. Prosecutor.  Rather, between -- it was between the 6th and the 9th. 
Q.	And during your travels you encountered roadblocks which were manned by civilians and military personnel together, correct?
A.	Yes, that is true. 
Q.	So these two were working hand in hand? 
A.	As I already explained, at some roadblocks they were working together, but at others they worked separately.  And I also said that there were even roadblocks that were set up by civilians exclusively without any soldiers. 
Q.	Do you know who had ordered the setting up of the roadblocks at which civilians and military officers worked together? 
A.	No, I do not know. 
Q.	You testified that what was happening at these roadblocks was the checking of identity cards to ensure that everybody passing by had an ID card, correct? 
A.	Well, not at all the roadblocks, only the roadblocks that I was lucky to go through. 
Q.	Did you observe any dead bodies around any of the roadblocks you went through? 
A.	At the time I went through those roadblocks, I did not see any dead bodies.  It is only when we were forced to leave our areas, when there was shooting all over the place, that we were -- we had to jump over people who had fallen and we could not tell whether they were still dead or -- whether they were still alive or dead.  But at the roadblocks proper I did not see any dead bodies. 
Q.	Witness, why would somebody fall in all that chaos and decide to stay on the ground?  These were dead bodies you were jumping over, weren't they? 
A.	As I have already said, we were running for our lives.  Our people were running for their lives.  And as there was shooting all over, some people would fall and one might be frightened to think that they would be the next to fall.  So I could not waste time trying to save somebody when my own life was at risk because there was firing all over the place. 
Q.	Would you agree that many innocent men, women and children met their death at the roadblocks in Kigali in April of 1994? 
A.	I would not agree with you if you are referring to the roadblocks.  But I would agree that during the war many innocent people, men and women, actually lost their lives. 
Q.	The Defence witness who testified before you told us that he also was able to travel through Kigali within this period, and he told the Court that he did see dead bodies along the roadblocks on his way to Gitarama.  So is it that you did not see the dead bodies, or is it that there were no dead bodies at the roadblocks in Kigali? 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Before you answer, Mr. Witness -- I believe that before the witness answers, Mr. President, the Prosecutor should be fair to this witness.  The previous witness stated the date on which he left Kigali, and that date was 12th of April.  The witness before you now, Mr. President, left Kigali on the 
9th of April.  I, therefore, object to that question. 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Witness, isn't it true that the Tutsi civilians in Rwanda were considered to be the accomplices of the RPF who had attacked Rwanda? 
A.	I would say not all Tutsis.  Accomplices were on all sides because it was known that the RPF army itself was made up of Hutus and Tutsis.  So accomplices could be found on both sides.
(Pages 1 to 10 by Joe Reynosa)














1000H
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Are you denying that Tutsi civilians were not considered -- or Tutsis within Rwanda were not considered to be the accomplices of the RPF? 
A.	I want to be very specific as to the situation that I experienced in my area.  You see, in the area where I lived and the area from which I left, I did not notice or observe this type of phenomenon you are referring to. 
Q.	You testified that when you got to Gitarama you would from time to time go to Murambi to take instructions from the government; is that correct? 
A.	Not from the government.  I was taking instructions from my direct hierarchy, my direct supervisor. 
Q.	That was the minister of information; correct? 
A.	At my level, I had nothing to do with the minister.  Between myself and the minister, there was a big gap.  As I said, I was chief of the sports unit.  And above me there was the chief of section, chief of programme -- chief of section.  So the person I was contacting was the chief of programmes. 
Q.	Could you give us his name, please.  
A.	The chief of programmes at the time was Nari Krofrotwa (sic). 
Q.	Spelling, please.  
A.	Hawrikura (sic) is N-T-A-W-U-K-U-R-A (sic), Froduald. 
Q.	So he was at Murambi with the government, was he? 
A.	I wouldn't say he was permanently, because he was coordinating graduate programmes.  He could be at Murambi just as he could very well be in Kigali. 
Q.	Are you aware that during the time when the government was in Murambi they continued to hold cabinet meetings? 
A.	Yes, I'm aware.  Even though, as I said, they worked in a chaotic situation, they tried to meet.
Q.	The government remained operational while in Murambi, didn't it? 
A.	I said that they considered that they were operational but in total chaos.  That was my observation. 
Q.	How much time did you spend in Murambi with the government? 
A.	I did not stay with the government for a long time because I did not stay within the same premises where they were located.  I stayed in this -- at this place where I had sought refuge in secondary school.  And I used to go to Gitarama, first of all, to the regional office.  And I went to Murambi less frequently.  
Q.	But you are willing to state categorically that the government which was seated in Murambi was operating in disorder.  You didn't spend time with the government, but you are -- you want to tell us exactly how they operated.  Isn't that strange? 
A.	I made reference to this time that I was there and when I was able to meet some members of the government in operation. 
Q.	You also testified today that you left Gitarama and went to Kigali sometime in mid-May of 1994.  
A.	Yes.  That is true.  That was my evidence. 
Q.	You were accompanied by a colleague of yours and a soldier.  I would like to find out who -- who assigned that soldier to accompany you to Gitara -- to Kigali.  Sorry. 
A.	Well, the radio station, not only during war times, is always guarded by soldiers.  And those who issue the orders will assign somebody to guard a journalist who is supposed to carry an -- equipment or some items from one point to the other. 
Q.	So soldiers were available to guard a journalist, like you, on your trip to Kigali.  I assume soldiers were also available to be assigned to protect the members of the population who were under attack.  Do you agree? 
A.	I wouldn't agree with that.  But what I can say is that there are key positions of the government, including the national radio station which should be protected.  So they ought to be able to find a soldier or a gendarme to protect those equipment -- whereas, they may not be able to find a soldier to go to a commune or a secteur. 
Q.	When you were going to Kigali, this soldier abandoned his post in Gitarama and accompied -- accompanied you to Kigali.  Are you saying that the authorities thought it more important to protect your life as opposed to protecting the lives of all the refugees who were fleeing attack? 
A.	Let me clarify for you that this soldier was not protecting my life.  He was there to protect the items that I was taking to Kigali and items I was taking from Kigali to Gitarama.  So it did not mean that a journalist travelling had a soldier to pro -- for -- as close protection.  Otherwise, I would not have left my region, Gisozi, to take refuge in Gitarama in the first place. 
Q.	So the authorities had the ability to assign soldiers to carry out security duties in Gitarama and around the country.  
A.	Please repeat that question. 
Q.	The authorities at the time had the capacity to assign soldiers to carry out security detail in Gitarama as well as around the country.  Let's talk about Gitarama since that is where you were.  
A.	I'm not able to say what the authorities were able to say -- to do.  But what I am able to say here is what I saw.  Now, regarding the number of soldiers or troops that were available to the authorities -- is something I cannot speak to.  I know that they had to guard the radio installations and that is what happened. 
Q.	When you got to Kigali, you -- you testified that you were able to go to the central market and there you witnessed some civilians who were engaged in looting.  Were these civilians armed? 
A.	Yes.  Those who were involved in looting, some of them were carrying weapons. 
Q.	What kind of weapons were they carrying? 
A.	When I saw -- at the time I saw them, I saw some men carrying rifles. 
Q.	And you are saying that Préfet Renzaho gathered a group of soldiers and ordered them to shoot these civilians? 
A.	I did not say that he gathered them and ordered them.  I said I observed that the -- Préfet Renzaho, together with the soldiers who were with him -- that he gave them instructions to shoot all those engaged in looting. 
Q.	Let's talk about your cousin, Setiba.  You have testified that he had -- he was known to be -- to engage in fraudulent activities and ban -- banditism; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Since when was this reputation of his known to the members of the population? 
A.	I am not able to give you the year.  But all I can say is that those -- the looting -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry.  We didn't -- hardly understand what the witness said, the last part of his answer. 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Could you repeat your answer, please.  
A.	I was saying that I cannot recall in which year Mr. Setiba started his fraudulent acts.  But I can say that he started when he was still very young. 
Q.	So it's a very, very long time before 199 -- before April 1994.  
A.	Yes.  He started his swindling activities well before 1994.  And when I say when he was young, that was probably when he was seven or eight years.  So that might have been in 1970.  So 1971, '72. 
Q.	Why do you suggest that this reputation of his was very well known in the community by the population? 
A.	Let me begin with myself.  I'm his cousin.  And in our native region -- anyone talking to him had to be very careful because he had that notoriety.  And when he got to Kigali, he proclaimed himself as a crook.  And his swindling activities was not limited to himself and his clients, but it went beyond the region in which he lived. 
Q.	Do you know that Joseph Setiba was a member of the MRND party? 
A.	I am not aware of that. 
Q.	But you do not deny that he could have been a member of the MRND party.  
A.	(No interpretation)
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I believe the first question does not allow for the second one. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This is cross-examination.  We permit the question. 
THE WITNESS:
Please repeat the question. 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	We have information to the effect that Joseph Setiba was a member of the MRND party.  Do you have any reason to question that information? 
A.	I did not challenge that information.  What I'm saying, that to my knowledge, personally, I'm not aware of the fact that he was a member of the MRND party. 
Q.	Were you aware of the fact that political parties within Rwanda had youth wings? 
A.	Yes.  Political parties had members from the entire spectrum of the population.  There were children, men, women.  I'm aware of that. 
Q.	Do you agree that the leadership of these youth wings were appointed -- or the appointment would have been sanctioned by the leaders of the various political parties? 
A.	I wouldn't agree with you, particularly since I do not know anything about organisation within political parties. 
Q.	We have information as well that Joseph Setiba was the president of the Interahamwe in Kigali-rural.  
A.	I do not have that information. 
Q.	Considering the reputation of Joseph Setiba which you have just described, what would you make of his appointment by the members of the MRND party to the position of president of the youth wing of the MRND, which was the Interahamwe? 
A.	First of all, let me say that I'm not aware -- 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Just a moment, Witness. 

Mr. President, witness has explained sufficiently clearly that he had no knowledge of the inner workings of political parties.  I know he's cross-examining and he's trying to establish the credibility of my witness.  But in any event, this question is not missible (sic) if it goes to his credibility.  So I object to that question.  

He told you, just as he told me in examination-in-chief, that he doesn't know the inner workings of politics.  So I do not think we can continue in this direction. 
MR. SENDZE:
I'm not sure how to respond, Your Honour.  But I think my question is appropriate and the witness can tell me what he thinks.  And if he has no information, he can also tell me.  So really, I would move that he answer the question. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We agree.  The witness should answer the question. 
THE WITNESS:
I will revert to my previous answer.  I was very interested in sports and not much in politics.  So I'm not in a position to comment on that. 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	You -- you testified that you -- Joseph Setiba is your cousin and you know him very well.  You are willing to tell the Court about how bad he is, how he was involved in looting, and you are not able to tell us whether he even belonged to a political party or what his activities were within the political party.  Are you saying that your knowledge of Joseph Setiba was only limited to his acts of looting? 
A.	I said that my knowledge of Setiba was purely social, as my cousin, as somebody who hails from my native region but not as a politician.  Because as I said earlier in this courtroom, I have never had the opportunity to participate in political activities and I've never had time to observe what happens within political parties.  So I had no interest -- having a discussion with him about what happens in his political parties.  And so that was not a common interest. 
Q.	Were you interested in looting to have discussed issues of that nature with Setiba? 
A.	Yes.  I gave an example of when he asked me to visit him.  And after that he was explaining to me that there was nothing special but that he wanted that top official to see that he receives people of his status, including a journalist.  And I told you that we chat as brothers. 
Q.	Okay.  So given his reputation, Mr. Setiba would be the sort of person that one would send to do his or her dirty job; correct?  Given his reputation. 
A.	Yes.  That was his area of operation.  From my observation and from what I said, he would do things that are of personal interest to him. 
Q.	You testified that he manned and controlled a popular roadblock at Giticyinyoni, which is on the way to Gitarama; correct? 
A.	That is true. 
Q.	And everyone going from Kigali to Gitarama would obviously pass through this roadblock.  
A.	That is correct because it's on the main road. 
Q.	What is it that made this roadblock very notorious? 
A.	It was notorious, first of all, because no one could go through without being checked at that roadblock.  And what was surprising, as I said -- because it was the roadblock that was very -- it was the most serious -- the most difficult roadblock, because there were other roadblocks manned by soldiers and this one was manned by civilians. 
Q.	You testified that the roadblocks in Kigali that you encountered were also involved in checking identity cards.  So I do not see why this one controlled by Setiba would be described as notorious if all they were doing was checking ID cards, just like at the other roadblocks.  So do you have any other information as to why Joseph Setiba's roadblock was considered a notorious roadblock? 
A.	I believe I've told you what I observed personally and what people were saying about that roadblock.  And I believe I said that they would not let anyone through and that they checked -- they had an in-depth check. 
Q.	Witness, Joseph Setiba's roadblock in Giticyinyoni was notorious because innocent Tutsi civilians were identified and killed at that roadblock; correct? 
A.	I cannot agree with you.  But what will (sic) surprise me is that Setiba will be involved in fraudulent activities, including killing people for their -- to be able to take their belongings. 
Q.	And he did that at his roadblock in Giticyinyoni.  
A.	I am not able to assert that because I did not witness that. 
Q.	Given that the government delegation left Kigali on the 12th of April and travelled to Gitarama, passing through Giticyinyoni, it is correct to say that they must have gone through Joseph Setiba's roadblock; correct? 
A.	I am not able to confirm or deny that.  As I said, on the 12th I was no longer in the capital; I was in Gitarama.  I'm not able to say what happened in Kigali. 
Q.	My question is this:  You have agreed that to travel from Kigali to Gitarama you would pass through Giticyinyoni.  The government left Kigali on the 12th of April and travelled to Gitarama.  They must have passed through Giticyinyoni; correct? 
A.	Let me revert to what I said previously.  I am not able to tell you about the itinerary that the government used.  The government had its own resources for moving around.  It had helicopters.  It had -- there are other routes.  So I'm not able to tell you the routes that they took and what happened during their trip to Gitarama. 
Q.	When you came back to -- when you returned to Kigali from Gitarama in May, did you still find Setiba's roadblock at Giticyinyoni? 
A.	Yes.  The roadblock was still there.  But I did not see Setiba at the roadblock at that time. 
Q.	Therefore, when the government officials were able to pass through Giticyinyoni, they observed the roadblock of Joseph Setiba and the notorious activities that were carried out there and this roadblock was, however, not dismantled.  Do you agree? 
A.	Let me repeat that I find it difficult to agree with you, particularly since I do not know the itinerary the government took to get to Gitarama.  And then at that time my personal conditions were such that I could not follow closely what was happening. 
Q.	You also testified that while in Gitarama you did not have the opportunity to see Joseph Setiba or to hear that he was in Gitarama; correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	So given the explanation that you have just given to us now about your inability to say how the government left Kigali for Gitarama because you did not observe their itinerary, I'm also suggesting to you that the fact that you were not able to observe Setiba's presence in Gitarama nor hear about it does not mean that Setiba was not in Gitarama.  Do you agree? 
A.	Let me state and repeat that I never saw him and I never heard that Setiba was in Gitarama at the time I was in Gitarama. 
Q.	We have information on the record in the form of PID. 062 that Setiba was seen in Gitarama by Emmanuel Ndindabahizi in the company of Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Donat Murego.  

Now, faced with that information, would you agree to the possibility of Setiba having been in Gitarama without your knowledge?  
A.	Let me repeat what I heard myself and what I saw with my own eyes.  Now, what you are saying comes from you, and I will, therefore, take it that you are the source of that information. 

MR. SENDZE:
Your Honours, I -- it's 35 minutes past ten.  I have one last line of questioning.  I could defer until after the break, or I could proceed. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
How -- how long will you be?  
MR. SENDZE:
It wouldn't take -- ten minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yeah.  We think we should take the mid-morn -- mid-morning recess now and resume after the break.
(Court recessed from 1031H to 1109H) 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Witness, you testified that Joseph Setiba was once imprisoned in Kigali and received a presidential pardon.  When was it that he was imprisoned, what year? 
A.	I'm not able to give you the exact dates.  But what I said is what I heard from him -- from him himself.  We didn't go into all the details about talking about the date and year. 
Q.	Did he tell you why he had been pardoned by the president of the republic? 
A.	He did not tell me. 
Q.	Didn't he inform you about any personal -- personal relationship he had with the president or any member of the president's family? 
A.	We never discussed that. 
Q.	But from your personal knowledge, don't you have information that he was close to the president or his wife? 
A.	I don't know anything about that. 
Q.	Before the break we discussed Joseph Setiba's membership in the MRND party and the youth wing which was known as the Interahamwe.  

I would please request the registrar to show you Exhibit D. NZ39.  

While that is being passed around, I would ask you if you know the person Robert Kajuga. 
A.	I don't know him.  But I have heard his name. 
Q.	In what connection did you hear his name? 
A.	Well, Kajuga is a Rwandan name.  And what I'm saying is that I've heard about him. 
Q.	What did you hear about him? 
A.	I have no clear recollection of what was said about him. 
Q.	You did not hear that he was the president of the Interahamwe in Kigali? 
A.	I know he lived in Kigali.  Now, that he was -- he was president of the Interahamwe -- something I'm hearing from you and which I'm seeing in this document. 
Q.	Do you know André Nzabanterura? 
A.	I'm hearing his name for the first time. 
Q.	He was the president of the Interahamwe in Kicukiro.  
A.	I'm hearing that from you. 
Q.	Do you know Dieudonné Niyitegeka? 
A.	I have no knowledge of that. 
Q.	We have information on the record that he was the national treasurer of the Interahamwe.  
A.	I know nothing about that, and I'm hearing that from you. 
Q.	Could you turn to the second sheet of the document you have in hand.  Do you see the names of Robert Kajuga, André Nzabanterura, and the others? 
A.	Yes, I see. 
Q.	Could you read the last name on that list.  
A.	Setiba, Joseph. 
Q.	And it is indicated therein that he was the president of the Interahamwe in Kigali-rural.  So now you have that information before you.  You don't have any reason -- 
A.	Unfortunately, I did not have that information. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, does the Prosecutor intend to circulate that document he's relying on for his cross-examination to the Defence?  
MR. SENDZE:
For my colleague's benefit it is D. NZ39.  And I believe the registrar showed you a copy before handing it to the witness. 

But if -- Mr. Issa, if Madam Diagne needs a copy, you can give this to her. 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Witness, we will -- we will move on.  You agree that Joseph Setiba was present on the ground at roadblocks in April of 1994.  
A.	Yes.  I admit that.  And I even said that I saw him once. 
Q.	He is, therefore, in a better position than you are to state exactly what was happening at the roadblocks; correct? 
A.	I will not -- I will not challenge that. 
Q.	He was also a member of the MRND party and a member of the youth wing called the Interahamwe, as we have just seen.  He is, therefore, in a better position than you are to state what the activities of these organisations were.  Agree? 
A.	As I said earlier, apart from seeing it in this document and hearing it from you, I did not know. 
Q.	Joseph Setiba is in prison, isn't he? 
A.	I'm not aware. 
Q.	You don't know where your dear cousin is at the moment? 
A.	He's not the only one whose whereabouts I do not know.  I told you about the consequences of the war.  And this affected every single Rwandan family.  As I told you, he's a brother of the extended family system.  But there are my own brothers.  So it's not surprising if I don't know where Setiba is. 
Q.	Setiba is in prison.  And he confessed to his activities in April of 1994.  
MR. SENDZE:
And I would please request the registry to show the witness Prosecution Exhibit 450, four-five-zero.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I would have wished my -- for my colleague to disclose to us ahead of time such a document.  And now to scan through this document very quickly, in addition to the large volume of documents that we have -- it would have been more appropriate for him to disclose this document to us even maybe five minutes earlier. 

Yes, Mr. President.  Having glanced through this document, I can say that it's a document under seal.  Can we use it without any difficulties?  Or did I misread?  It appears there's a problem. 
MR. SENDZE:
I -- I think we can use the document without compromising any protective measures. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Prosecutor, we think you can proceed carefully. 
MR. SENDZE:
And may I just note that there is no -- oh.  All right.  Sorry.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Witness, do you have the document? 
A.	Yes, I have it. 
Q.	In this -- in this document Joseph Setiba is confessing to belong -- to belonging to the militia group known as the Interahamwe.  He is also confessing to possessing a firearm and for having been engaged in wearing military uniforms in April of 1994.  
A.	Yes.  I see the document.  But what I'm able to say about it is that it's a personal confession and I cannot say anything about it. 
Q.	In the document he also confirms that he was appointed president of the Interahamwe in Kigali-rural by a gentleman called Laurent Semanza, who was the MRND chairman.  And this appointment was made on the request of Mr. Joseph Nzirorera.  
A.	I'm not able to make any comment on that because I did not follow that and I'm hearing it from you and in this document before me. 
Q.	So just like we established before, given that Joseph Setiba is in a better position to discuss what happened at the roadblocks and what happened with the Interahamwe and the MRND, the information he provides on this document is superior to any information you may have in these respects.  
A.	Let me try to restate what I said regarding the internal organisation of parties or organs of the parties.  I would not be the appropriate person to talk about it.  If it is proven that he is a member and since I said I was -- I did not know; I'm getting to know it today, I cannot comment about it.  

All I can say, that on the basis of my knowledge of the person and considering the prevailing circumstances, people like Setiba were among the first to be courageous enough to set up roadblocks.  I don't know if it is within that framework that he accepted it or not.
(Pages 11 to 20 by Tanya West)






























1130H 
MR. SENDZE:  
I must apologise.  I had given a document to Mr. Issa and I intended to instruct him to disclose it to the Defence, but I did not do that.  So I will please request that he -- he kindly make available the document to the Defence. 
BY MR. SENDZE:  
Q.	While he is doing that, Witness, do you know a certain Mujawingoma, Petronille?  I will spell that.  M-U-J-A-W-I-N-G-O-M-A.  And then Petronille, P-E-T-R-O-N-I-L-L-E. 
A.	I am hearing that name for the first time. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I think that the issue of disclosure of documents has already been raised on two occasions, and now we are dealing with a third document.  In the French version we have part of the document, and I believe that we need time to familiarise ourselves with this document because it would not be proper to raise questions about a document we are not familiar with. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, you want -- what is -- 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
(Microphone not activated) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Before my learned colleague opposite speaks, I would like to say that this witness left the box since Wednesday, and my learned colleague had enough time to prepare his cross-examination and disclose the documents in time for us to be able to follow properly this morning without creating any incidents. 
MR. SENDZE:
Mr. President, I have apologised for the slip.  I was supposed to disclose the document to the Defence as soon as I began my cross-examination.  That was not done.  But the extent to which I am going to use this document does not require extensive perusal by the Defence, and that will become obvious when I am done with the document.  And I believe if counsel wants to read the document, they can go through it and maybe deal with any contents that they want to deal with in re-examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, have we seen a copy of this document?  I don't recall it was sent to us. 
MR. SENDZE:
No, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you have copies for the Bench?  

MR. SENDZE:
No, Mr. President. 

For the benefit of the record, this is a statement from Mujawingoma, Petronille recorded on the 
26th of July 1996. 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Witness, did you say you don't recognise this name?  
A.	I do not know that person personally. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Now, Mr. President, we have a difficulty. 

Learned Colleague opposite, please.  Now, the document that you are referring to has not even been disclosed to us in relation to this witness.  You did disclose some documents to us, but this document -- and as I perused through this one, I see that the witness's name is mentioned, but you did not disclose this document to us.  Now you want to use this document and you claim that the Defence doesn't have to worry.  

But this is a blatant abuse of procedure, irrespective of the manner in which this document will be used, 
Mr. President.  We, therefore, need to ensure that there is equality in terms of the use of various documents, not to have documents sprung at us at the last minute.  The Prosecutor has had some ten years or so to prepare his case and then one or two minutes before his cross-examination he wants to disclose his documents.  This is not fair, this is not serious, Mr. President. 
MR. SENDZE:
Mr. President, with all due respect, this morning the Defence engaged in extensive examination of this witness in relation to Mr. Joseph Setiba.  There is nothing in the will-say that was disclosed to us that informed us that the Defence will be discussing such issues.  In spite of that, we did not request for any adjournment or more time to go and prepare.  We cross-examined the witness anyway.  So that was a slip on the part of the Defence as well. 

Now, I have acknowledged that this document was not provided to the Defence on time in relation to the cross-examination of this witness.  This document does not fall under Rule 66(B), and the Defence was not entitled to it before today.  So I guess it's now up to the Court to rule whether I should proceed with the use of this document in cross-examining the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  The -- the position I think is fairly clear.  And the -- we expect, as we have said repeatedly, that at the commencement of cross-examination the cross-examining party should disclose the documents intended to be used during cross-examination. 
Counsel has acknowledged that this was not done, and he has also given an explanation, in that with regard to this matter the research was done this morning. 

We think that the -- it is not a sufficient basis to deny him the opportunity to use it in cross-examination.  We will decide in due course whether the -- any additional time needs to be given for
redirect examination, depending on the way in which the -- what evidence is adduced in relation to this document.  So we permit the cross-examination to continue on this document. 
MR. SENDZE:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Now, Witness -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Prosecutor, we should remind you that we hope that this is an isolated slip. 
MR. SENDZE:
Yes, Mr. President. 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Witness, this lady was a colleague of yours at Radio Rwanda in April of 1994.  If you turn to the -- the fourth sheet of the document you have in French -- sorry, the sixth, page number 6. 
A.	I cannot find that page. 
Q.	Are you looking at the French version?  
A.	Yes.  I have the French version. 
Q.	So count six pages down.  The page numbering is not very clear, so just count six sheets. 
A.	I have only five pages before me. 
MR. SENDZE:
Issa. 

Does everybody else have page 6?  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Witness, do you see the name Martin Mukwie?  M-U-K-W-I-E. 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you know that individual? 
A.	Yes, I know him. 
Q.	Could you read for the record what Petronille says about him? 
A.	Should I read?  

"Martin Mukwie is a Kinyarwanda journalist who also made hate statements against the Tutsis.  He said the same things as his colleagues and he is in Bukavu in Zaire.  Alphonse Munyazogeye is a journalist, Radio Rwanda, died of cholera in exile in Zaire."  
Q.	Now could you read what Petronille says about you. 
A.	"Cyprien Ngendahimana broadcast the same type of programmes over Radio Rwanda and is currently in Goma in Zaire."  
Q.	And that would be the same kinds of statements that Martin Mukwie broadcast over the radio.  That's what she means; right?  
A.	Well, as far as I am concerned, I do remember that Martin Mukwie is a broadcaster, a journalist.  But the death in Goma, I don't -- I don't -- Mujawingoma, I don't -- I don't remember.  I don't know what that is all about.  Mujawingoma, I don't know what it is all about. 
Q.	Yes.  But the facts that you have read on the record from -- from Petronille are accurate, aren't they? 
A.	What I can say is that this is not accurate.  It is not absolutely accurate.  For example, my name is mentioned and what I can say is that I was never a broadcaster.  And the programmes over radio which I ran had nothing to do with this type of characterisation. 
Q.	Witness, before coming to testify here in Arusha, how many times did you meet with the Defence team for Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Two or three times, I think. 
Q.	And during those meetings you told them about what you intended to come and testify to at the Tribunal; correct? 
A.	Yes, we talked about that. 
Q.	Did you tell them that you were going to come and testify about alleged fabrication of evidence?  
A.	No.  I never -- I never said any such thing. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ngendahimana, for answering my questions, and I've come to the end of my cross-examination. 
MR. SENDZE:  
Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Prosecutor. 

Mr. Witness, you are now going to have to respond to the Prosecutor -- to the -- to counsel for Mathieu Ngirumpatse, who has an opportunity to put questions to you in redirect examination. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I have a few questions for you in relation to Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  

Please, kindly repeat to this Court what you know about him and tell us whether what you know of him lies outside your personal contact or experience with him. 
MR. SENDZE:
I'm sorry.  I'm not sure that redirect is an opportunity for the Defence to ask the witness to restate his evidence-in-chief.  And I believe that the question that my colleague just asked is exactly what she's soliciting. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Yes, Learned Colleague, I am fully aware of that.  But during your cross-examination you pointed to the fact that the witness did not have personal knowledge.  I, therefore, simply want him to restate that fact. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Hounkpatin, if he has already said it in examination-in-chief, it is unnecessary for him to restate it in redirect. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Very well, Mr. President. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, let us turn to the document that you had before you a few minutes ago.  Turn to page 1 and look at "Identification of witness".  And under that point look at "Item number 6".  

In April 1994 Madam Petronille Mujawingoma was in charge of health services at Radio Rwanda.  Is that correct, according to this document?  
A.	I am not aware of her duties.  We never had those services at the ORINFOR, which I know. 
Q.	Did you know that person? 
A.	I have already stated that I am hearing the name of that person for the first time here. 
Q.	In 1994 you were working, and at that time did you run any radio programmes? 
A.	I think I have already explained this to the Bench.  I was in charge of sports programmes, and when the presidential plane was brought down sports programmes were no longer broadcast over radio. 
Q.	Are you therefore saying that you never broadcast any radio programme at that time? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	So you are saying that the statements made by this person, whom you do not know, and the services referred to, which did not happen, amount to lies; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  That is correct, madam. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  That will be all. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Ms. Hounkpatin.  

Mr. Witness, this concludes your testimony, and we thank you for assisting the Trial Chamber in its work.  We thank all our witnesses who testify in this manner. 
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Mr. President. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I would like to apply, as usual, for this witness to be granted permission to meet Mr. Ngirumpatse before he leaves the Tribunal, or the country.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

	The registrar will make arrangements to grant the request made by counsel. 

	You're excused and you're free to go. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
(Witness excused) 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, the next witness is LCI, and Frédéric Weyl will be leading this witness.  Thank you. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, before the witness is brought into the courtroom, allow me to submit my own mea culpa and to tell the Bench and my learned colleagues that we may be using two documents. 

For the record, it sounds that there is an alarm that has gone off, and that is why I stopped. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  The registrar has gone to make enquiries.  You may proceed in the meantime. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, am I to say that -- would it just be that I am being sanctioned by some manner of justice, simply because I simply omitted to mention to this Tribunal that we are going to use two documents which the Prosecutor is very familiar with, because they already appear in his file of exhibits or his documents that he presented? 

But you may want to know, Mr. President, that we would rather express some reservations as to the manner in which documents can be used.  But we want to use this document, subject to the appeal made in respect of the decision to admit or reject the said documents.  So -- however, we want to stand by our appeal, but to point out also that the documents I am referring to are P. 198 and P. 244.
(Witness entered courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. -- Mr. Weyl.  We will address admissibility if and when the occasion arises.  

I would just like to let you know the registrar has reported to us that what you suspected was an alarm was simply a test of the system.  So I trust that you're no longer alarmed. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I am rather reassured by your comments. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, Mr. -- Mr. Weyl, we have noted that the witness came in as though he were not a protected witness, and the registrar has informed us that he was instructed to do so by your team. 

Now, we want to tell you that we don't think that's the right way to go about it.  Because we have made a protection order for his benefit, and until it is rescinded he remains a protected witness.  So, in future, we'd be grateful if you would not tell the registry to act in this manner. 

Now, Mr. Witness, at the request of counsel for the Defence -- Mr. Witness, good morning, sorry. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
At the request of counsel for the Defence, the Trial Chamber had made an order for your protection on the understanding that it was necessary, as a security measure.  Recently we have been informed that you no longer wish the protection order to cover you and that you wish to testify in your own identity openly in this court and that you're requesting that the Chamber rescinds the order it had made for your benefit.  Is that the position?  
THE WITNESS:
That is, indeed, my position, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  We -- we therefore rescind the protection order we made in your benefit -- on your behalf. 

Before you begin your testimony, you have to take an oath to tell the truth.  And I will now ask the registrar to assist you to do that. 
(Declaration made by Aloys Twambaze in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, Mr. Witness, you will give your testimony by responding to questions put to you by counsel; first of all by counsel representing Mathieu Ngirumpatse, who will begin his examination now. 
MR. WEYL:  
Thank you, Mr. President. 



ALOYS TWAMBAZE, 
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, the Trial Chamber has pointed out to you that you will be answering my questions, but you will speak to the Bench.  I would like to ask you to speak slowly, clearly, because your testimony is being interpreted into the English language for the benefit of those who, in the courtroom, do not understand French. 

Interpretation is also provided for my questions which are put in French, interpretation of my questions into English.  Between my question and your answer, it will be necessary to observe a brief pause in order to enable the interpreters to complete the interpretation of my question before taking on your answer. 

Do you understand me, Witness? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, I understand you very well. 
Q.	Furthermore, I would like to ask you to kindly spell out any proper nouns that you will mention, for the benefit of the court reporters. 

At this juncture, Mr. Witness, allow me, first of all, to start by confirming your identity.  What is your name? 
A.	My name is Twambaze.  T-W-A-M-B-A-Z-E. 
Q.	And your first name? 
A.	My first name is Aloys.  A-L-O-Y-S. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, to spare you the trouble of repeating your particulars, I would like to ask the registrar to help us by placing before you the personal identification sheet so that we can go through it together.  And we may want to start by correcting this personal identification sheet, which we prepared, to the extent that there is a mistake in the spelling of the witness's name. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. Registrar, please kindly place that document before the witness.  Thank you.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, kindly look through the document carefully and correct any of the information, as need be, and then proceed to sign the document. 
A.	I correct my first name.  A-L-O-Y-S, rather than A-L-O-I-S as contained on the document. 
Q.	Please kindly correct.
A.	It is done.  Thank you. 
Q.	Thank you.  Please sign it and hand it over to the registry so he can show it to the Bench and the parties.  And please put the date.  Date the document if it doesn't appear there yet. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I request that this document be accepted and marked D. NG94. 
MR. MJUI:  
The correct number of the exhibit is D. NG99.  Nine-nine.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NG99 admitted) 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, you were born in 1957 in Nyamutera.  N-Y-A-M-U-T-E-R-A.  Are you able to tell the Court in which part of Rwanda Nyamutera is located? 
A.	Nyamutera is located in the northern -- north -- northwestern part of Rwanda, in the 
	Ruhengeri préfecture, exactly 17 kilometres towards the south.  That is the locality, Nyamutera, where I was born. 
Q.	Did you spend your childhood in Nyamutera, or in another part of Rwanda? 
A.	I spent my childhood in Nyamutera.  That is where I did my primary schooling. 
Q.	When did you finish your primary education? 
A.	I finished my primary education in 1969.  And I went to secondary school in Musanze, where I did humanities and the sciences in 1975. 
Q.	Can you spell Musanze, please.  
A.	M-U-S-A-N-Z-E.  It is close to Ruhengeri town. 
Q.	At the end of your studies at Musanze, did you continue with -- did you undertake other -- did you continue with your education, or you went to work?
A.	At the end of my secondary education, I went to the -- the senior military academy, the -- in Kigali as a candidate officer of the Rwandan armed forces. 
Q.	How long did you stay in the École supérieure militaire in Kigali? 
A.	I was there for three -- for over three years.  I graduated in 1978 as a second lieutenant. 
Q.	Did you belong to a particular corps of the army which enable get -- 
A.	This training in the École supérieure militaire was a general training.  I went through the training in the École supérieure militaire, and then from there could be sent to another -- to pursue studies for another corps, or I could be sent directly to the armed forces to work as an officer. 
Q.	Please tell the Chamber what your first transfer were -- what your functions were when you graduated from the École supérieure militaire of Kigali.  
A.	When I graduated from the school, I was assigned to the Ruhengeri commando as a chief of platoon, a platoon leader.  
Q.	Platoon leader.  And how long were you there?  How long did you stay there? 
A.	I remained there for three years, before being transferred to Butare to the -- general officers' school as an instructor. 
Q.	Until what dates, approximately, did you stay there and exercise your duties at the general officers' academy and what were your functions? 
A.	At the general officers' academy, I spent a few months, I believe.  In February 1982 I was transferred to the Bugesera instructions centre as a company leader, as an instructor.  I had to train soldiers. 
Q.	What then -- what was your next station -- or your next -- your next duty station? 
A.	My next transfer was in 1983, when I was transferred to the military police -- as a platoon leader of the military police. 
Q.	And until when did you remain there and what was the next transfer? 
A.	In 1984 I was transferred to the École supérieure militaire as a -- a promotions commander and a military lecturer until 1990. 
Q.	If I understood you clearly, from 1984 to 1990 you were an instructor at the École supérieure militaire in Kigali; is that correct? 
A.	Yeah, that was about it.  But I was a commander of a -- promotion.  I was -- that means I was in charge of a group of soldiers and ensure their discipline and also teach military science. 
Q.	Tell the Chamber what was the nationality of the colleagues that you had at the École supérieure militaire. 
A.	At the École supérieure militaire, there were mainly Rwandans.  There were Belgian soldiers who were assistants who were also lecturers.  There were French nationals also who were teaching a -- candidate officers.  There were civilian teachers, visiting lecturers who came to teach some science subjects. 
Q.	Among your colleagues at the École supérieure militaire are some names that come to mind -- that come to your mind and who may be known to the Chamber in one way or the other.  Do you have any colleague who became known -- well known publicly? 
A.	Publicly known, I won't know.  But there was major -- he was then a major, but I think he was already a colonel when he came to testify before this Tribunal, that is, Major Duvivier, Jacques. 
Q.	And among your Rwandan instructor colleagues, are there some names that come to your mind which may be known to us? 
A.	Rwandan?  Yes, there were many.  I have in mind Major Neretse, who was a -- a visiting lecturer, who I believe came to testify before this Tribunal once.  

There are others, such as gendarme Major Kanamugire, Gabriel, whom, according to my -- to -- according to the latest information -- latest information available to me, is also colonel in Kigali.  

Maybe there are others, but I cannot readily recall their names. 
Q.	And among the lecturers? 
A.	Among the lecturers I will say -- I will mention Mr. Gasana, Anasthase, who was a French lecturer, who subsequently became minister of foreign affairs of the RPF.  He was also, I believe, ambassador to the United Nations.  But I don't know what he is today. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 

You left the ESM -- the ESM is the acronym for the École supérieure militaire, senior military academy.  You left the ESM in 1990 for which duty station? 
A.	It was not a transfer.  I had to go and do further studies in military administration in Belgium.  I took an entry exam and I was successful.  I left in August 1990.  I was recalled in November 1990 to come and participate in the war.  I fought against the enemy that had attacked my country. 
Q.	You were then in Brussels from August 1990 to November 1990, as you said.  Tell us a little more about your activities.  In what context -- the school in which you were doing your studies, your colleague, your environment.  Can you give some clarifications about that? 
A.	I left - or, I went with a Rwandan colleague called Denis Nkundiyaremye.  N-K-U-N-D-I-Y-A-R-E-M-Y-E, Denis.  When we got to Brussels, we went to the school where there were other students, 
	Belgian officers, who were to be our colleagues at the school.  It -- this was in royal -- the advanced royal institute -- military institute in Belgian.  And our small school was close to the advanced war school. 

We undertook our studies with Belgian soldiers, who were captains and majors, French speakers, and others.  And next to our school there was another military school which train students who were majors in the Rwandan army. 
Q.	When you were in Brussels during that period, did you continue getting information on what was happening in Rwanda? 
A.	When we left, the war had not broken out.  The war broke out on the 1st of October.  And it was from that time that I and some of my colleagues living in Brussels, that was when we tried to get information relating to our families, the situation on the field.  We continued getting information until we were recalled in November to go and participate in the war effort. 
Q.	You therefore went home to Rwanda to serve in the defence efforts of your county.  
A.	That is correct.  We were recalled and we complied immediately.  When we got to Kigali, we were transferred as soon as we arrived.  We did not spend much time in Kigali.  We went straight on to the field. 
Q.	Witness, maybe -- 
MR. WEYL:  
Mr. President, here we are beginning with another line of questioning, very detailed, that we would like to focus the witness's attention on.  I see that it is 12:27.  Will the Chamber wish me to engage in this line of questioning now, or will it not be more coherent if we took the break now and took this line of question as a one -- as one whole when we come back in the afternoon?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We can take the adjournment now.  I expect you to make up time this afternoon. 

I said we will take the adjournment now and I expect that you will make up the time this afternoon. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, the Court knows, and well placed to know, that since we've been together lost time is never regained, as is said in the song. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We take the luncheon adjournment now. 
(Court recessed at 1225H) 
(Pages 21 to 32 by Deirdre O'Mahony)
























(Court resumed at 1410H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, all.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, thank you.  

Good afternoon, everyone.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, good afternoon.  I will, once again, remind you of the need to observe a pause between the question and the answer, as well as the need to speak slowly in order to facilitate the 
interpreters' work.  

This morning, Mr. Witness, we were talking about Belgium.  You said this morning that you left Belgium and went back to Rwanda -- middle of November 1990; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	When you returned to Rwanda, mid-November 1990, where were you first assigned? 
A.	I got to the Kigali airport in the evening, sometime in the middle of November.  On the following day, 
I took a helicopter, which was to take me to my post of assignment in Kibungo, at the 
Kibungo operational command.  The command post was at the Akagera hotel for that particular command.  With regard to the function of -- as an adviser to the sectoral commander, the duties of an adviser consisted of inspection on the ground of units of that sector, who were scattered all around in that sector.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, thank you.  I think that in order to -- for you to be clear and for us to understand you better, it is necessary for you maybe to show on a map of Rwanda the areas where you were assigned successfully.  
MR. WEYL:
	Mr. Issa, could you kindly assist me in giving this witness a map of Rwanda.
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	And request the witness to show on this map of Rwanda, using number 1, the area where you were assigned in Kibungo.
MR. WEYL:
I think that everyone in this courtroom has a copy of this map which I'm using for work.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, maybe you can assist us.  Can you please help us by showing us where is Kibungo on that map of Rwanda in front of you.  
A.	Leaving from Kigali, in -- which is in the middle of the country, you go west; you go towards Rwamagana, and when you move southwards -- you move south-east, rather, you'll come to Kibungo, which is the headquarters of the préfecture.  Kibungo is bounded on the west by Kigali, in the south by Burundi.  To the east you have Tanzania, and the north you have the border between the Byumba and Kibungo préfectures, almost in the middle of a national park.  

So the place where I was assigned to was Kibungo at the operational command, which was not located in the administrative district.  The command post was at the Hotel Akagera near Lake Ihema, which is the big lake which you can see here on the map -- the biggest lake you see here.  So this is approximately where the Akagera hotel was and this is where the command force of the Kibungo operational sector was located.  
Q.	Thank you for that clarification.  Can you please tell us for how long were you there and what were your basic duties. 
A.	My main duties consisted of inspection; in other words, on behalf of the sectoral command, I would go and see how the units on the ground were doing, what was their physical and morale state, and then report to the sectoral commander.  

In the meantime, there was a gendarmerie position which was located along the border of the park in the Rukara area, which had been attacked and disrupted by the enemy.  So our sector had the order to send there a unit in order to see what was happening there.  So I accompanied a company commander who was to intervene at that position.  

So I left with the company, but I was not the commander of the company, I just went there with them to see how they were working.  And when we got to the position which had been attacked, we noticed that there were damages.  A bus had been burnt.  There were some bodies of gendarmes strewn around there.  

The enemy had withdrawn into the park.  We pursued them inside the national park, and on our way we noticed that they had abandoned some livestock which they had rounded up during their offensive.  
We also noticed that they had abandoned bags of foodstuff which they had looted from members of the public.  

There were also some units they had left behind in order for them to attempt to slow down our progress.  But we dislodged them and continued our advance up to the end of the national park.  

At one point I noticed that the command of the company was not running smoothly.  There were some shortcomings which were not acceptable.  So I asked the sectoral command to take over the company command, and the sector command agreed with me on that.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, in order to facilitate your work, I would like to request you to show on the map, using number 2, the place you say was called Rukara, and then write down number 3 at the place where -- which was your final destination at that time.  
A.	Now, we're inside the national park pursuing the enemy who had attacked the gendarmes's position.  When I requested that the company command should be taken over by the sectoral command, this request was agreed on.  

I continued with the company but, you know, this time around with the effective command.  

In the evening, we were attacked in the Twinsure valley by the enemy.  The Twinsure valley is between these two lakes which you see below Lake Ihema some few kilometres from here.  I'll write 
number 3 here.  

Now, in this Twinsure valley, we were attacked from an enemy fortified position.  The enemy was waiting for us.  The units that had attacked the gendarmerie were units that had gone to look for foodstuff, so they were not really a combat unit.  They were just soldiers who went to get supplies.  

So we were engaged in fighting and sustained -- there was sustained gunfire, I would say for about 
one hour, and the enemy gave up and finally retreated towards the Akagera river. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, could we have some of the spelling of some of the places he mentioned.  Thank you.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. Witness, I have to discipline myself by observing a pause.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell us, what period are you referring to?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, I thought you'd heard.  There was a request for spelling assistance for the names of the places he had been speaking about.  
MR. WEYL:
Yes.  We made a mistake -- I agree -- with that by -- by not spelling -- giving the spelling.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Now, to avoid -- maybe Mr. Twambaze can help us by spelling the proper names which he has just mentioned.  Rukara is not a problem.  Rukara is not a problem.  
A.	Yes.  The valley where we were attacked by the enemy is called Twinsure, T-W-I-N-S-U-R-E.  We fought against them for about one hour.  The enemy withdrew towards the end of the national park, towards the Kagera river.  
Q.	I don't think there's a problem with Kagera.  Anyway, spell it out.
A.	K-A-G-E-R-A.  So when the enemy abandoned their position, we wanted to occupy that position.  The -- when a wounded sold -- a wounded soldier shot me and wounded me in -- in my arm, after giving necessary instructions, since I was bleeding, I was evacuated at night to Rwamagana where I was given a blood transfusion before going home to Kigali for convalescence.  Here we're talking about the end of November 1990.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  At the end of November 1990, this means that you spent approximately 15 days there immediately after coming back to Rwanda; right?  Or another perception of the situation of Rwanda during that period would be a perception regarding a state characterised by -- or, rather, clashes, skirmishes -- or could you say that there was actually a situation of war raging? 
A.	At that time prior to my arrival in -- my arrival in Rwanda, the enemy had been kicked out of Rwanda, I believe, towards the end of October.  They were kicked out totally from Rwanda.  But there were some units which had remained behind and they were scattered all over the national park.  

I'm not talking about isolated soldiers.  I'm talking about some units who, instead of withdrawing to Uganda, decided to go to the national park so that they could hide in the park.  

The situation which I saw was a situation which resembled an end of a war because everybody thought that the enemy had been kicked out once and for all.  I did not see any animosity when I got there.  What I saw is that -- is that there was a mopping-up operation intended to get rid of some units and soldiers who had been scattered in the national park.  So at that time there was not a real major war front vis-à-vis the enemy.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, according to what you know regarding the presence of the enemy troops there, were they coming from Tanzania?  Because I can see on the map you have points which you have marked which were near Tanzania.  Were they from -- coming from Tanzania, or were they coming from another country?  Of course, if you know.  
A.	I -- I know the answer.  The enemy who attacked us -- who attacked the gendarmes's position were enemy -- sold -- enemy soldiers who were in the national park.  I don't know where they had come from, but I assumed that since the Akagera river is a natural landscape and it's difficult for enemies to cross it by foot, and in view of the fact that that area is a very swampy region and given the fact that the enemies who had been kicked to -- towards Uganda had gone to Uganda; whereas, others went to the east to the national park, but those soldiers had come initially from the north, from Uganda.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, so if I look at the map, they had penetrated the country quite deeply -- I mean, coming from Uganda, they had penetrated into Rwanda quite deeply.  
A.	Not that deeply.  These were actually strayed soldiers in the park who did not know maybe how to get back to Uganda, which was their sanctuary.  Therefore, they -- they wanted to take advantage of the forested area of the national park in order to hide from the Rwandan armed forces' units who were pursuing them.  

So I think that they were there in order to protect themselves, but I don't think that they were there in order to carry out operations other than operations to seek supplies because they were hungry.  Since they were cut off from their rear bases, they could not really have claimed that they were carrying out large-scale operations.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  So you said that at that time you were wounded and that you were evacuated for treatment.  Do you confirm that? 
A.	Yes, I confirm that.  
Q.	So did you recover from your wound, and, if so, after that, were you given a new assignment? 
A.	Yes.  I spent a week at home.  I felt better, but the wound was still there.  However, I could do something.  I was -- went to the general staff to request them to assign me to another place to other duties before healing totally and, therefore, before going to the war front.  

So they proposed to me that I should work -- I should be given office work at the headquarters, but since I'm not an office worker, that duty did not really suit me.  So I requested them to give me something on the ground which would not be too difficult.  They, therefore, offered me to go and be involved in the training of recruits -- a recruit battalion at the Bigogwe training centre which had just been set up in view of the war.  

Shall I spell Bigogwe?  Bigogwe is written B-I-G-O-G-W-E.  Bigogwe.  And Bigogwe is between the Ruhengeri préfecture and the Gisenyi préfecture.
Q.	Can I -- can I ask you to indicate by marking number 4 where Bigogwe would be on -- on the map.  

Mr. Witness, I believe that you have identified Bigogwe on your map.  Now, allow me to ask you what your mission to Bigogwe was when you were thus assigned.  
A.	My mission to Bigogwe involved training young civilians who had been recruited to become career soldiers, training them so that they could become true and well-equipped soldiers for the battle front.  This is what I did for a month.  And, thereafter, the battalion was sufficiently trained to go to the 
battle front.  

It was then put under the supervisory authority of non-commissioned officers and corporals from the commando training centre who were former trainers.  

In early January those recruits and the commando training people were put together in the 
CECODO battalion which then went to the front.  And our first bat -- our first operation was in Kiyombe, K-I-Y-M-B-E (sic) -- in Kiyombe, in Byumba préfecture in an area -- how do I say this?  The area is generally referred to as Rukiga, R-U-K-I-G-A.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, thank you.  I would like you to use the number 5 to indicate the location you have just mentioned on the map.  But before you proceed, I would like you to clarify.  When you mentioned a battalion, how many recruits are you talking about on average? 
A.	My battalion was a big battalion of about 1,200 recruits, and if I were to add the supervisors, the total number would be around 1,300 persons.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you had to train some 1,200 recruits in Bigogwe during your assignment in order to come up with that battalion; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  I received civilian recruits who had just been selected by the competent services.  I received them.  I provided them with military equipment; I trained them and I took them to the battle front.  
Q.	I take it then, Mr. Witness, that when you say "I" -- "I", you are referring to yourself, but also to your colleagues who were part of that training exercise; isn't it so?  You yourself did not single-handedly train 1,200 people; is that correct? 
A.	Well, yes, indeed, not I alone.  When I say I did, it should be understood to mean myself and the team that were responsible for the training, including the trainers or instructors, those who were in charge of commando training who had already been to the battle front and who came back to join my battalion upon their return.  And then I also had the supervisors who were assigned for those training purposes.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, the trainers or instructors in Bigogwe, were they all Rwandan nationals? 
A.	No.  There were some instructors of Belgian nationality who did not take part directly in the training, but they provided us with didactic materials or equipment.  They provided material for our firing exercises. They also helped us with climbing and how to overcome various obstacles, and though those types of technical assistants -- but they were not directly involved in the training as such, and, like I said, these were Belgian instructors or trainers.  
Q.	Did those Belgian trainers come to Bigogwe only from time to time or were they settled in Bigogwe? 
A.	Well, they were assigned to work in Bigogwe, but their residences were in Gisenyi.  They left Gisenyi in the morning to come to work and then returned to their residences in the evenings.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You told us that in early January 1991 you went to Kiyombe.  What did you do there?  What was your mission to Kiyombe? 
A.	The enemy had succeeded to capture a major part of the commune and had gone as far as the Kiyombe communal office, which is some 6 kilometres from the border.  Some units had already intervened before me, including particularly the paracommando battalion.  

My battalion was called in to clear out the area, and so we went to link up with the 
paracommando battalion in order to ward off the enemy -- that is, until they were pushed out of the country or beyond our borders.  

So the fighting was quite heavy.  A lot of firing, a lot of heavy weaponry was used and we -- the fighting was very intense, and we did our level best to push or flush the enemy out of our territory.  But great was our surprise when, although we thought that we had been attacked by the traditional enemy, we then found out -- upon trying to chase out the enemy, we came upon the military gear that they were abandoning and their identity cards.  

And our surprise was great when we realised that the weapons that we gathered -- the machine guns and personal weapons -- bore identification marks indicating the source of the weapons, namely, Uganda.  And we could also see on the identification papers the names of Ugandan soldiers, their service numbers and the various units to which they belonged, and all of these were Ugandan soldiers.  

You see, I take it that if a unit were based in Kabare, a Ugandan town, I do not think that there would be any other army in that town apart from the Ugandan army.  That is why, from that time on, I began to wonder about the identity of our enemy, and I came to the conclusion that we were at war with Uganda.

1445H
BY MR. WEYL: 
Q.	Did the fighting stop in January 1991, or did it continue?  And were you still involved in the fighting thereafter?  
A.	When we warded off the enemy, my battalion was assigned to stay on briefly to monitor the -- the border during those war times.  So we had to monitor and guard the borders.  There were a few exchanges of gunfire with the enemy on the other side of the border.  And nothing much else happened until Ruhengeri came under attack again towards the end of January -- January, and at that time I was dispatched to intervene in Ruhengeri.  That was towards the end of January 1991.  

So the answer to your answer -- or, rather, to your question is that the war did not come to an end there.  That, in fact, was just about the beginning of the war. 
Q.	So you and your battalion were sent to defend Ruhengeri.  What did you notice there and what was the nature of your activities?  
A.	In that case again, the paracommando battalion had been sent to the area initially, and they had engaged the initial fighting with the enemy.  And at the Mukungwa bridge -- Mukungwa is spelt M-U-K-U-N-G-W-A, Mukungwa, the river Mukungwa -- the east/west area was occupied by the Ruhengeri commando battalion which was fighting the enemy on the Gisenyi-Ruhengeri road on the outskirts of Ruhengeri city.  My own battalion was dispatched to that area and the paracommando battalion had already warded off the enemy to the point from which they had come into contact right back to Ruhengeri.  And I started fighting the enemy in Ruhengeri.  

So, along with the paracommando battalion, we pushed the enemy out of the city down to the valley lying to the north of Ruhengeri, between the city and the volcanoes.  Then we continued to chase off the enemy, and then we noticed how much damage they had done at the time of invading the city, including, particularly, the killing of one inspector whose name was -- I don't think I remember his name quite, but I might just remember it in a bit.  They had killed that inspector and then they also had killed a magistrate.  

On their way towards the volcanoes, the enemy had also killed the bourgmestre of Kinigi, Mr. Gasana, and one influential trader in that area known as Ntuyenabo, Elasto.  

So, we continued -- 
Q.	Please, Witness, can you spell the names.  Spell out, please.  
A.	Oh, by the way, I remember the name of the inspector of mines who had been killed by the enemy.  His name was Gakwerere, G-A-K-W-E-R-E-R-E, Gakwerere.  The bourgmestre of Kinigi, his name was Gasana, G-A-S-A-N-A.  And the trader who was killed at the same time as Gasana was Ntuyenabo, N-T-U-Y-E-N-A-B-O.  Those are the only names that come to mind.  There were other names, but we were not able to identify them, given that we were still chasing after the enemy right up to the rice farms at the volcano, in the forests.  And they got lost in the forests.  We remained at the level of the rice farms while they went into the forest.  We waited and simply set out to watch over the rice farms around the forest area.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, can you use number 6 to identify on the card -- on the map, rather, the area which you have just been referring to, please.  

Now, Mr. Witness, the forces you were battling, were they small groups or large groups?  
A.	The soldiers or combatants who had attacked the city of -- were large -- were a large group, a big contingent, because we needed up to three battalions to dislodge them from the city.  And even to push them out to the volcanoes, we had to deploy three battalions over a span of about 4 kilometres.  And all our elements were involved in fighting to push them -- to ward them off, and the enemy was fighting back.  So the answer to your question is that, yes, it was a large group.  
Q.	When they withdrew to the park in the volcano (sic), was that the end of it?  Did they leave you alone?  Did the fighting come to a halt?  
A.	No, not at all, not at all.  When the enemy withdrew into the forest, my battalion was assigned to monitor the rice plantations around the forest area.  So I did that through a number of small patrols which every now and then would clash with enemy patrols here and there.  

But the more serious issue for us was that the enemy had mounted a Katyusha, or a multiple cannon weapon at the very top of the Gahinga volcano, which is the second volcano from the right from Mabura.  That is the second volcano from that end.  So they had mounted a Katyusha at the top of that volcano, which plundered us -- or, rather, which shelled our position on a daily basis.  And the entire Kinigi area, and the people who had monitored our progress in warding off the enemy, once again, had to flee to Ruhengeri town.  

So, the enemy also conducted small infiltrations in order to destabilise the people by using various mines, by laying mines in the Kinigi area.  Once again, the jeep of the commander of that sector was blown up by a mine, and the sector commander was seriously injured and had to be hospitalised for a number of weeks.  
Q.	Do you remember the name of that sector commander?  
A.	Yes, at the time it was Major Bizimungu, Augustin.  
Q.	Did you succeed to ward off the enemy, or did he remain at that location?  
A.	Things remained in the same state for about two months.  You see, it is a rather dangerous and suicidal operation to attempt to enter a forest into which the enemy preceded you.  So we had the issue of the Katyusha shelling, which was affecting our population and buildings around that area.  So it was very difficult to put into place a strategy which would successfully dislodge the enemy from the volcano.  

However, around the 10th of April, we attempted an operation to re-conquer the volcanoes.  That operation lasted about a week, and the volcanoes were freed around the 19th of April.  I do remember clearly because that is the birthday of my eldest son.  On the 19th, therefore, the enemy had been entirely -- or, totally chased out of the volcanoes.  
Q.	From that 19th of April 1991, did you have any other missions, or was that the end of the fighting?  
A.	Well, that was the end of the fighting in the volcano area.  But the war continued, and I had to continue to serve during the war.  So we also needed to defend the volcanoes, even after we had taken it back -- taken them back.  So my battalion and the 70 battalion -- the 71st (sic) battalion were involved in defending the area known as the grand col, which is an area of about 6 kilometres between the Gahinga volcano -- Gahinga to be spelt is G-A-H-I-N-G-A for Gahinga, and Sabyinyo, the other volcano, S-A-B-Y-N-Y-O (sic).  So my battalion and the 74th battalion -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Correction, 74th battalion. 
THE WITNESS:
-- were supposed to meet every two weeks, along with two companies, in order to ensure the defence of what was known as the grand col.  And then there is the petit col, which is between Gahinga and Mabura.  That area was about 1 kilometre wide and was defended by units from the Ruhengeri sector.  

The other battalions, made up of two companies around the volcano, and the battalion 74, or my battalion, CECODO, had to be in their barracks waiting for assignment.  The barracks being in Bigogwe -- Bigogwe which I have already spelt.  So they were in Bigogwe barracks waiting to be assigned.  From the time the volcanoes were recaptured those two units were the reserve units, namely including our unit and the paracommando unit which were not all in the same barracks as the other battalion.
BY MR. WEYL:  
Q.	How long did you remain in that sector?  Up until what date?  
A.	Well, in the meantime, I was assigned to other missions in other sectors, or in the same Ruhengeri sector.  But I remained in that position until June 1992, at which time I was transferred to the headquarters and I became a member of the disciplinary council set up to hear cases of indiscipline within the army, and propose measures to the chief of staff.  
MR. SENDZE:  
Excuse me, Mr. Weyl.  

Mr. President, we have been listening for one hour, and we are beginning to wonder what the relevance is of the line of questioning that we have been following up for an hour.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, the relevance of this line of questioning has already been mentioned in the will-say statement.  We are currently looking at the problem of the war context of Rwanda, starting from October 1990, and which we want to show the Court that these problems persisted along on the northern and eastern fronts in Rwanda, which are essential parts of the country.  And this in respect for the whole period in question, starting from October 1990.  I think that it's important for us to understand the context, and especially in relation to the accusations levelled against Mathieu Ngirumpatse before this Tribunal.  

So I'm surprised that the Prosecutor is raising the issue of relevance -- relevance regarding an essential element which we have -- which we are in the process of raising right now before this Court.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, we -- we think we will allow counsel to continue.  If you consider to think that his line is not relevant, we will make some savings when we come to the cross-examination.  
MR. SENDZE:  
Obliged, Mr. President.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, thank you.  The Prosecutor should be rest assured that we've -- we're almost at the end of 1992, and if he is not interested in that particular period, then you might as well avoid questions regarding that period.  

So please be patient, Mr. Prosecutor.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, so you were transferred to headquarters, general staff.  When was that, to the best of your recollection?  
A.	It was in the middle of June 1992, approximately.  
Q.	From April 1991 to June 1992 you were continuously faced with the war situation between you and the same enemy; wasn't that the case?  
A.	Yes, you're correct.  
Q.	Did you spend a long time at the general staff, or were you assigned to other duties?  
A.	At headquarters I spent only two weeks.  Why?  The reason is that the Nyagatare operational sector in the northern eastern part of the country had just been attacked by the enemy, and we had lost ground -- a lot of ground on the battlefield.  At that time the effective sectoral commander, who at that time was Colonel Nsabimana -- spelt N-S-A-B-I-M-A-N-A -- he was sick, he was ill, he was being treated at home.  So when the situation worsened in Nyagatare the chief of staff enquired about Colonel Nsabimana's treatment and asked him to interrupt his convalescence.  

He asked me to do the same thing, so we took the same helicopter and went to Nyagatare, because the person who replaced the sectoral command, Colonel Gatsinzi, in the eyes of the high command, was not -- could not actually fulfil the -- his duties.  And it seems that he was acting in bad faith when it came to acquitting his duties as sectoral commander when it came to issuing orders.  The territory that our forces had conceded to the enemy was lost because there was no resistance at all because soldiers had not received adequate orders to the effect that they should counter the enemy's attack.  
Q.	Can you please spell Gatsinzi's name and maybe give us his first name, and tell us who was he.  
A.	Gatsinzi was a colonel, is G-A-T-S-I-N-Z-I.  His first name is Marcel.  I think that the concerns of the command turned out to be true, because later it -- he held several functions in the forces in the government of our former enemies.  So we thought that he was acting in bad faith, and our concerns and fears were founded.  
Q.	Can you tell the Trial Chamber what were Marcel -- what are Marcel's -- Gatsinzi's duties that you are referring to?  
A.	I don't know all his duties, but I knew very well that he was the deputy chief of staff of the gendarmerie.  In any case, he was the first deputy chief of staff of the new regime.  And then he became a minister of defence.  I think that currently he is the minister of taking care of disaster situations, that is, dealing with issues such as national -- natural calamities, and refugees, and so on and so forth.  But whatever the case, he is a minister.  
Q.	So, at that time you were sent to try and restore the situation which had been compromised under the command of Marcel Gatsinzi; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	So, what situation did you find on the ground?  Can you describe to us what your duties were at that point?  
A.	At that time, Colonel Nsabimana resumed his duties as a sector commander, and I was assigned as an S3 officer, that is the officer-in-charge of coordinating operations.  So we set to do -- to carry out our duties by beginning to restore the morale of our troops.  We managed to stop the enemy forces at their positions at that time, so they had stopped at their positions then and organised themselves.  We organised ourselves, too.  

But behind the enemy forces there were forces -- big forces which we had never seen or heard about before.  So they shelled us using totally different weapons from what they had used prior to that, with very alarming precision.  It was as if we were fighting against an army which had weapons which we didn't know, because those were weapons which we were -- did not know.  So they shelled us, they bombarded us; they would sometimes hit us with about 200 shells per day.  

And those shells were very accurate.  It's difficult.  For example, a small pickup truck with a surface area of 10 cubic metres could be hit by a single shell from 8 kilometres away.  So they were firing with a precision which I cannot describe.  

Furthermore, there were infiltrations.  There were infiltrations sent behind our lines.  And those infiltrators would damage properties owned by peasants, especially in trading centres.  They would destroy pickup trucks of small businessmen, they would destroy houses, they would take away people.  We caught one of -- an enemy soldier who had a radio, a two-way radio, and he confessed that he was one of the members of a group which was informing the enemy our heavy artillery positions, and that they were setting ambushes and that they were destroying cars belonging to small businessmen.  

We went through a month of hell.  People were very unhappy because the people, too, were being shelled.  They were being bombarded, because the enemy didn't stop by simply shelling our positions.  They would shell anything of significance.  They would shell medical centres, administrative centres, a parish.  Everything that had any shape or form would be shelled.  So we were demoralised because our means to respond to the enemy did not -- no longer matched theirs.  The population was -- members of the public were very unhappy.  They noticed that our action was not worth anything anymore.  

That was how the situation remained up to the month of October 1992, when we obtained and signed a ceasefire agreement, and then we had a short period of -- a lull.  But the period between July and October 1992, in the Nyagatare area, saw a terrible situation in that area.  We couldn't describe the enemy manoeuvres.  They had the -- changed their combat methods, they had changed their equipment.  Because it started suddenly.  One week we had the same resources or assets.  But a week later the enemy had acquired more sophisticated equipment, and they had very effective intelligence units, and they had sophisticated weapons which we -- we did not have.  That was the situation facing us at that time.

1515H 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I think you have gone ahead of the question which I have in mind.  

I'm now talking to you in your capacity as a career soldier.  Weapons, sophisticated weapons are not everything because they cannot necessarily be precise in their aiming of targets.  You have to know where to aim, how to aim.  So can you tell us how -- in your opinion, how did the RPF weapons and firing become so precise?  And can you tell us what were the targets?  Were the -- were the targets only military or otherwise? 
A.	Firstly, the precision -- let's talk about the precision of weapons.  Those were weapons which we did not know prior to that, so we thought that those were precision weapons.  

Furthermore, earlier on I said that there were infiltrators.  Some infiltrators were raiding trading centres and destroying vehicles and taking away people.  Some infiltrators remained behind in order to 
gather intelligence which they relayed to the artillery units.  

I also said that either they had people who gave them information regarding the potential targets to be hit and who gave the artillery units the precise locations or the enemy had acquired weapons with 
good targeting equipment.  These are the three points which I see.  I don't think that there's anything more. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You talked about infiltrators, acts of violence; how did you know that those acts of violence had been committed by infiltrators? 
A.	First and foremost, Rwandans were on the side of the Rwandan armed forces, so the 
	Rwandan armed forces could not have carried out acts of violence against them.  

Secondly, I told you that on one occasion we were able to capture an enemy operator and he was a radio operator, an enemy radio operator.  And he acknowledged that he was a member of a group which were the -- carrying out intelligence gathering on the ground in order to -- for the enemy to send out commanders to the various centres so that the commanders would not have to spend time looking for their targets.  So they would have acted in order to allow the commanders -- in order to go and destroy their targets. 
Q.	Did you manage to intercept or neutralise RPF soldiers or infiltrators whom you're able to identify as being members of the RPF? 
A.	Oh, yes.  There was in particular the radio operator.  We captured about ten of them.  There were some who got away.  They passed through our lines and went to their areas who were hiding in banana fields or in wooded areas which were there.  And those who captured acknowledged, admitted, they were members of people who had come there to carry out raids. 
Q.	Earlier on I asked you to tell us what were the targets of those precision attacks, if you have examples of specific targets in your mind.  Could you tell us whether they were exclusively military targets or whether the targets were also civilian in nature? 
A.	I think that at one point I said that the RPF was precise when it came to shelling the opposition.  They were destroying everything that they saw as the opposition.  On top of that, they were destroying anything of significance in all areas.  By significance -- by significant targets, they would target schools, health centres, parishes, trading centres, big houses.  They would just shell all those things.  

Moreover, to give you an example of a precise shot which I remember, and which impressed me, is that at one point we -- we were given equipment which we had put in a rice field in Muvumba commune.  And we managed to intercept a radio message using the radio set which we had taken away from the radio operator.  They captured the radio operator.  We were able to intercept a message to the effect that there was equipment in the rice field and that the RPF had to bombard the equipment.  So we intercepted that message.  We removed the equipment in question very quickly and moved it elsewhere.  And a minute later a shell fell in the rice field and hit directly the building in which we had stored the equipment in question.  

That is an example of this indescribable precision because you're talking about shells fired from 
ten kilometres away which fell -- hit a building, whereas we had small artilleries which -- with which it was impossible to count the precision artillery. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, at that time did you have a feeling that the fight encumbered between you and your enemy was equal? 
A.	No.  We were totally overwhelmed, totally overwhelmed.  We had -- couldn't do anything in the face of what was happening.  We did not have any other means with which to counter the enemy. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, thank you.  Before losing track of what we're doing, can you put number 7 -- or look 
	at -- put number 7 where you say Nyagatare was.  You said that Nyagatare was where the war front was and that was where the sector commander, Marcel Gatsinzi, was.  Can you put number 7 there, please.  And I'd like to request you to please put today's date and sign that map.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I'd look to request you -- after receiving the map and after the parties have received -- have received the map, we'd like to request that this document be admitted into exhibit as 
Exhibit D. NG100. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we admit the document into evidence.
(Exhibit No. D. NG100 admitted) 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'd like to make a request with respect to the exhibit.  My understanding is that these -- these are different positions up to June of 1992; is that correct?  Up until what date or what period has the witness made indications on the map?  
MR. WEYL:
	Maybe the witness could tell us up to what day did he remain at the war front, where he was when he left the war front.  
THE WITNESS:
Up to October 1992 I was still an S3 officer of the Nyagatare operational sector.  At that time I believe there was a ceasefire accord and we withdrew in the face of intensive shelling from October to -- from 
July to October 1992.  In November I took over command of a battalion in Nyagatare sector once again.  

There was -- the situation was still calm because of the ceasefire agreement.  It was in 
December -- towards December -- or, rather, around the 20th of December I requested that I be given time off in order to pursue further studies.  And I was given a green light on or around the 20th.  So around the 23rd I went home in order to prepare my departure for Belgium.  So I left the war front between the 20th and the 30th of December 1992. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	So you left Rwanda -- or, rather, when did you leave Rwanda? 
A.	I left Rwanda on the 2nd of January 1993. 
Q.	Was the war over when you left Rwanda? 
A.	I had hopes.  This is why the high commander allowed us to go and pursue further studies.  So I was really hopeful, but my hope was dashed very early on.  It was towards the end of January when RPF forces launched an all-out attack, which took them near Kigali -- which took them to near Kigali.  So I understood that the ceasefire agreement that had been signed was just for them to -- to have time in order to prepare themselves for that wide-scale, large-scale attack. 
Q.	So if I understand you, when that attack took place the government of Rwanda believed in peace, so much so that they allowed some of their soldiers to go abroad for training.  
MR. SENDZE:
Sorry.  Counsel is testifying. 
MR. WEYL: 
I will rephrase my question. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, what did you think of the military situation which prevailed in Rwanda when the enemy forces carried out their attack in 1993? 
A.	When the belligerents signed the October 1992 ceasefire agreement, there was an effective ceasefire.  There was almost no combat up to the time when I made an application to go out and resume my studies, just like other officers.  
So I think that when the government of Rwanda allowed us to go abroad, just like me, they thought that the war would be over, the war would end.  And the people too started having hope.  But we were disappointed by the RPF reaction because I can personally say that the RPF lied when they signed the ceasefire agreement.  They just wanted to buy time so that they could prepare the January 1993 attack. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I'm looking at the time.  Does the Court wish to -- wish for me to take on another 
line of questioning?  We have -- we've covered about three quarters of our examination-in-chief.  So I was wondering whether this was an appropriate time for us to take our break. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, we did not entertain any familiarity with the song you referred to just before lunchtime.  So since you asked for our preference, would you continue entertaining us for another ten minutes or so and see how far we can go?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I'm not playing with the time, which would have led me to say that we've covered the minutes lost this morning.  Actually, we've gone beyond the normal time, so I think that if the -- if we take ten minutes -- but I'm wondering whether this will help us when we start to take a new line of questioning in terms of coherence.  

I wonder if the registry could tell us how long have we spent already in examination-in-chief. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I understand your point.  You see, a new line of questioning may have -- may involve different things.  So if there was -- you could have wrapped up something in ten minutes, there would've been an advantage in -- in just doing that.  If the new line is going to be much longer than that, then it doesn't make sense to start.  It was -- could have put the question in that way. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, what I was saying a while ago is that I had finished this line of questioning, and that if I were to start another line of questioning, it would take more than ten minutes.  This is why I believed that this was a good time to break.  I am done with this particular line of questioning.  

And before I move to another line of questioning, I think it might not be possible for me to complete that new line of questioning in ten minutes.  That is why I would like to request that we go by our 
normal scheduling.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We'll take our adjournment now.

Mr. Witness, I should advise you that -- that during this or any adjournment, while you're a witness, you're not to discuss the case or your testimony with anyone.  Do you understand?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  We take the adjournment until tomorrow morning.
(Court adjourned at 1535H)
