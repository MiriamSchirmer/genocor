Defence Counsel. 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  The Defence this morning is made up of 
Callixte Nzabonimana himself, Maître Nathalie Le Blanc, Monsieur Erik Sullivan, who I think will come back shortly, Maître Courcelle-Labrousse will come back later this morning, and myself, 
Philippe Larochelle.  Thank you, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Good morning, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we are resuming your testimony this morning and we would like to remind you about the 
solemn declaration you made yesterday, and that you will continue to testify bearing that declaration in mind; bear in mind also all the other instructions that were given to you by the Trial Chamber yesterday.  

We are in open session, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
MR. MAWERE: 
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  We will commence cross-examination in 
open session and should there be need to go into closed session, we'll advise the Trial Chamber. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Witness, we are beginning your testimony in open session.  This session may be attended by the public.  Be careful not to mention names and places which may identify you.  
Learned counsel who is going to lead your cross-examination is aware of the need to preserve your identity and, therefore, he is going to be careful when putting the questions to you.  

On your part, if you consider the answer you might give might give your identity away, don't hesitate to alert the Trial Chamber to this fact.  

Is that understood, Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Learned Counsel, for the Prosecution, you may start your cross-examination.

CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	Witness, I will be asking you questions to seek clarification on the evidence that you gave this 
	Trial Chamber yesterday.  Do you understand? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	I will try and make my questions fairly short and straightforward and we will expect you to answer them in like manner.  Are we agreed? 
A.	I agree with you. 
Q.	Yesterday, you told the Trial Chamber that you have never seen Callixte Nzabonimana before, correct? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	And you have never seen him pass by either, correct? 
A.	Never. 
Q.	You don't know whether he has brothers, do you? 
A.	I do not know.  I do not know his brothers. 
Q.	You don't know if he has sisters, do you? 
A.	I heard people say that he had a sister living in Vunga. 
Q.	And you have never seen him visit his sister in Vunga, correct? 
A.	It was around the 90s -- around 1990, a vehicle passed by the road and people were saying, "That is Mr. Nzabonimana who is going to visit his sister in Vunga", but I do not know her. 
Q.	My question, Witness, is not whether you heard people tell you something.  My question is:  Have you ever seen Callixte Nzabonimana go to visit his sister in Vunga? 
A.	No, I did not personally see him.  I simply heard people say that he was going to visit his sister. 
Q.	If one says you used to see Callixte Nzabonimana on his way to visit his sister at Vunga, that would be an untruth, Witness? 
A.	I did not quite understand your question. 
Q.	I will repeat my question.  If someone says they -- you told them that you used to see 
	Callixte Nzabonimana go to Vunga to visit his sister, that person would be telling an untruth, correct? 
A.	That would be a lie. 
Q.	Witness, how did you first meet the investigators for Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	I met members of the Defence team for Callixte Nzabonimana at the Ntarabana parish. 
Q.	Under what circumstances? 
A.	The members of that team knew that I was present in Gasenyi on the 10th of April.  They knew that I knew what had happened in Gasenyi on that day. 
Q.	Could you tell us how they knew that? 
A.	While I was still in prison, I would often discuss with a certain Célestine Ndahogoye and I will tell him about the events that had taken place in Gasenyi.  I told him that even though people were saying that some officials had committed the genocide or had distributed weapons, Callixte Nzabonimana was not one of such officials.  Later on, this person called Célestine Ndahogoye told me that there were some people who wanted to meet with me at the Ntarabana parish.  So I went there and met with 
	Jean Claude and Célestine in Ntarabana. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, can we go into a straight closed session.  

Members of the public, we regret you have to leave now, we'll not take long.  We have a matter to discuss touching on the identity of the witness.  

Registry.

MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
We are now in open session, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we are back in open session.  Don't give names of people or places that may identify you.  And if you have a difficulty answering any question, let the Chamber know.  

Is that clear, Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel. 
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	Witness, did you meet the investigators for Callixte Nzabonimana in private or in public? 
A.	I met them in private.  There was no other person present. 
Q.	Was it in an office? 
A.	I met them at Ntarabana parish.  The priest made a room or an office available to them in which we had our discussion. 
Q.	How many were you in that room? 
A.	There were three of us, the two investigators and myself. 
Q.	Do you know the names of the investigators? 
A.	Yes, there was Jean Claude and Célestine. 
Q.	And how many times did you meet with them? 
A.	I met them once at Ntarabana.  And later on, I met Célestine at Kabgayi, who, on that occasion, was accompanied by a white person. 
Q.	Where at Kabgayi? 
A.	In Kabgayi, it was in the month of July 2009. 
Q.	I asked, where in Kabgayi? 
A.	It was close to the Kabgayi Basilika. 
Q.	Did you meet under a tree, in an office or where? 
A.	We had our discussion within -- inside the room. 
Q.	Any other occasion that you met them -- you met the investigators? 
A.	I met them again when I came here to Arusha. 
Q.	In short, you met the investigators twice in Rwanda and once in Arusha, correct? 
A.	It is true that I met them twice in Rwanda, but here, in Arusha, I met them more than once. 
Q.	How many times here in Arusha? 
A.	We did not meet here in the courtroom.  I rather met with them at the place where I am accommodated. 
Q.	I said, here, in Arusha, Witness.  I didn't say in the courtroom.  How many times did you meet them in Arusha? 
A.	I did not count the number of times on which I met members of the Defence team.  In any case, I met them on several occasions. 
Q.	On what day -- date did you first meet them in Rwanda at Ntarabana parish? 
A.	I no longer remember the date, neither the day nor the date.  I remember only the month. 
Q.	What time of the day was it? 
A.	It was around 8 o'clock in the morning. 
Q.	And how long did that meeting last? 
A.	The meeting lasted for two hours. 
Q.	What were you doing in those two hours with them? 
A.	They put questions to me on what had happened since the shooting down of 
	President Habyarimana's aircraft and all what happened after that. 
Q.	And you were able to see them whilst answering their questions, correct?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, your question is not clear.  What do you mean he was able to see them while answering questions?  
MR. MAWERE: 
Madam President, I mean he was -- they were in the same room facing one another, and he could see them and they could see him.  I don't know whether that makes it clear. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, that clarifies the matter. 
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	Would you now answer, Witness?  
A.	We were in the same room. 
Q.	We already know you were in the same room.  The question, Witness, is, were you able to see them as you were answering their questions, like you are seeing me now as you answer my questions? 
A.	Yes, when I was answering their questions, they were looking at me and I was looking at them and they were taking down notes. 
Q.	So they took down notes as you answered their questions, Witness, correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And those notes were read back to you at the end of your interview, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you confirmed what they had read to you was what you had told them, correct? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	In that discussion with them, you also discussed your Gacaca confession with them, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you told them you had participated in attacks, did you? 
A.	I told everything to those men.  I did not hide anything. 
Q.	And singled out your participation in attacks, you told them that, isn't it? 
A.	No, I never participated in attacks.  I told them what was contained in my guilty plea. 
Q.	Witness, we'll come back to your guilty plea.  When they read back to you the notes that they had written, did you append your signature to confirm that's what you have told them? 
A.	I did not sign it on that day. 
Q.	You signed it on a later day? 
A.	I still did not sign it. 
Q.	But your statement was recorded, what's missing is only your signature, correct? 
A.	Yes, they took down notes. 
Q.	Again, when you met the investigators for the second time, they took down notes as they recorded your statement, correct? 
A.	Célestine and a friend of his, who was a white person, were taking down notes.
MR. MAWERE: 
I think at this time, Your Honours, I would request the witness to leave the courtroom briefly.  We need to raise issues that he should not be party to, disclosure issues.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Registrar, arrange for the witness to leave.  
(Witness exited courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecution Counsel. 
MR. MAWERE: 
Madam President, Your Honours, all along the Prosecution was under the assumption that there were no written statements or notes from this witness.  The only information that Prosecution was given by the Defence regarding this witness was a summary of what the witness is going to say.  This was disclosed to the Prosecution on a number of occasions, the last disclosure being made on the 15th of April 2010.  

And that disclosure, Your Honours, the Defence only gave a very brief and general summary of what this witness will say.  In fact, they gave us a 10-line statement, a summary of what he was going to say and that -- for instance, they said that he was going to testify on allegations against Callixte Nzabonimana in Nyabikenke.  And they said that he was going to say -- 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
If you are going to read all the summary -- I'm just checking whether it is better if we move into closed session -- just be careful not to put any information that may identify the witness, even if he is not here.  
MR. MAWERE: 
I thought there was no attempt to identify the witness, Learned Counsel, and we'll take that into account. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, you may continue.  
MR. MAWERE: 
There are issues that are contained in this witness's summary that we have been served by the Defence, which issues the witness already denied, and the only source of that information would have been the witness and his notes would actually confirm whether or not he said what he said since notes were recorded.  There could be many other issues that were recorded which we have not been made privy to, which incapacitates our cross-examination of this witness. 

We humbly request that this witness's cross-examination be stood down and we be accorded the notes that were taken in respect of this witness so that we be able to effectively cross-examine this witness.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel.
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
We strongly oppose this motion by the Prosecutor.  It is made under false pretext -- under false pretext that they did not get notice of what the witness would say.  

If you look at what is announced -- it is in French and I will translate it for the record -- "He shall be testifying on allegations made against Callixte Nzabonimana in Nyabikenke.  He shall be testifying that he is a farmer and that he would see Callixte Nzabonimana pass by on the road when the latter was going to visit his sister in Vunga."  I stop here to explain that.  

I think what the Prosecutor elicited from the witness earlier is not different from that.  The witness said that he did not see him personally, but that people were saying that he was going to see the sister in Vunga.  Seeing the car going and seeing Mr. Nzabonimana passing are two different matters and this is precisely where the evidence is.  So there is no matter or evidence which was not elicited or which is different.  In any matter, there is nothing there that warrants the Prosecutor's submission that they are suddenly incapacitated to do their cross-examination.  

Next will-say -- next sentence of the will-say of the statement:  "He shall be testifying that he did not see Callixte Nzabonimana in Gasenyi and that he did not distribute weapons during the events from April to July 1994."  That covers all the area of the testimony of the witness where he explained he is a farmer and he goes near Gasenyi and he doesn't see Nzabonimana.  This is what he said.  There is nothing different in his testimony than what is contained in the will-say.  

Next paragraph -- next sentence of the will-say:

"He shall be testifying on the judicial treatment of the genocide in Nyabikenke and on his own personal judicial situation."  So, here, you have all the matters pertaining to his judicial file and the accusations in the Gacaca.  

And then: "He shall be testifying on the credibility of Prosecution witnesses who hailed from Nyabikenke."  This was elicited by the Prosecutor in his cross-examination.  He asked questions about what was going on in the prison and that some people were making allegations against Nzabonimana on the road, and the people at prison were saying that these allegations were false.  So that was announced, and then maybe the Prosecutor will ask questions about that.  We didn't dwell on that issue.  

But the next sentence of the will-say is:  

"He shall be testifying on the positioning and the political influence of Callixte Nzabonimana in the Nyabikenke commune."  Maybe the Prosecutor can explore that area as well.  They are welcome to do so.  But they even have notice of areas they can explore that we didn't go ourselves.  

So the Prosecutor's submission that the content of the evidence of that witness was not announced and come as a surprise is completely unfounded and a false pretext.  Because they don't like what they are hearing; they obviously have difficulties getting what they want and they want to postpone it, I don't know for what reason, what they hope to get by doing that.  

And the second leg of their submission that the Defence should be compelled to disclose their notes is not grounded, is unfounded.  We have received no notes.  Never a single note of the Prosecutor's investigator was disclosed to the Defence, and it is a well-known rule that the investigator's notes are privileged.  This is Defence material -- this is -- this is material which doesn't have to be disclosed and which the Defence does not disclose.  So the witness was clear that he never signed a statement.  The Prosecutor attempted to have him say that he signed a statement and the Prosecutor (sic) responded very clearly that he has never signed a statement.  So I don't know -- there is no provision in the rules for forcing either party, the Prosecutor as well as the Defence, to disclose the notes they are taking when they do interview witnesses.  

And may I remind the Prosecutor that the request for disclosure of a statement, CNAL made a further statement that was never disclosed to the Defence before he came to testify and 
Your Honours ruled they should not be considered as a statement even.  So notes are even further away from that and should not be subject to disclosure.  These are my submissions, 
Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel. 

Any reply?  
MR. MAWERE: 
Your Honours, the very first response I would like to give is that these were not just notes.  This was actually a statement which the witness has confirmed was read back to him and he actually confirmed that is what he had told the investigators.  

Previously we have challenged the Defence to produce statements of their witnesses which they used to generate the summaries, and they indicated they didn't have, they disclosed all that they had.  They met this witness in July 2009, got a statement from him, read it back to him and he confirmed it and they did not disclose it to us.  They recorded some statements in 2010, which they have disclosed to the Prosecution.  What is so special about the statement of this witness that they would withhold it and not disclose it to the Defence (sic). 

It is not proper for learned counsel to say that the Prosecution is under the false pretext, that what the witness had said is not different from what is contained in his statement.  To begin with, counsel has read on his own the statement stating that the witness used to see 
Callixte Nzabonimana.  The witness categorically denied that here.  They have it in the statement that they recorded from him.  Perhaps this is why they are not disclosing it to the Prosecution.  That would not be proper.  So there is clearly a difference in what the witness said to them, which is recorded in the statement that they read back to him and he confirmed what he has now said in Court.  They should easily produce the statement that they read back to the witness.  

Thank you, Your Honours.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
May I briefly respond?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, very briefly, Learned Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Because the Prosecutor is calling it a statement and proposing to the witness that that constitute a statement, that doesn't make it one.  Of course, when you meet the witness, you ask questions and then you re-ask those questions at the end and you check your notes and you say you told us that, you told us this, and do you confirm this.  This doesn't create a statement.  A statement is something that is sworn and signed.  This is a statement.  Notes of investigators are not a statement.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Learned Counsel for the Prosecution, we wanted clarification from you.  Did you receive the will-say which learned counsel has been reading?  
MR. MAWERE: 
That is not will-say, Madam President.  What learned counsel was reading to us is a summary of the witness's testimony.  

But perhaps to add on to that, Madam President, we have received statements that were not signed from Defence as part of disclosure.  We have those statements.  So it would be inappropriate to say that because this one did not sign, it's not a statement.  We have statements that we've received from Defence counsel which do not bear the signature of the witnesses.  This was just a proofing chart.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel, we heard you say that there was a will-say.  Would you like to clarify that matter?
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Well, this is announcing what the witness will say.  And as the Prosecutor submitted himself, there were repeated disclosure to him of what I just read.  This is the latest version which was provided on 15th April.  What I read is the latest version of that, which was disclosed to the Prosecutor on 15th April, but this is announcing the content of the testimony of the witness.  So, effectively, it is a will-say. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, but in what document was it contained?  That's what we wanted to know.
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
It was contained in the list of witnesses that were disclosed.  It's at page -- I don't have the 
first page of that document, but it is the list of witnesses that were disclosed and reviewed and amended on 15th April 2010, following the Chamber's order to that effect. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

MR. MAWERE: 
Madam President, we actually have a copy of that document, if the Court wishes to have a look at it. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We do have a copy.  Thank you, Prosecutor.  
MR. MAWERE: 
Thank you.

1030H 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned counsel for the Prosecution, are there areas in your cross-examination which you have prepared and which you can cover pending the receiving of the ruling by the Trial Chamber? 
MR. MAWERE:
Yes, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  As that is the case, we propose that you continue with all the other areas which you are able to cover and the Trial Chamber will render a ruling before you complete your cross-examination.  
MR. MAWERE:
Obliged.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, could you arrange to bring back the witness in the court, after the curtains have been closed.  

And, Learned Counsel, do you want us to continue in closed session (sic)? 
MR. MAWERE:
Yes, Madam President.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	Welcome back, Witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we would like to remind you that we are still in open session.  So be careful not to give any information that may identify you.  

Witness, have you heard the Trial Chamber? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have properly understood.  
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	Witness, what was your itinerary on the 5th of April 1994? 
A.	I kept my cattle.  That was my regular occupation.  
Q.	Are you saying you kept your cattle because it was your regular occupation or you know for certain that on the 5th of April 1994 you were looking after your cattle? 
A.	I remember clearly that on that day I drove the cattle to graze.  
Q.	And where did you graze them on that day? 
A.	Throughout that week we were supposed to graze our cattle in the Muryacyeru valley.  So we had to keep the cattle in that valley.  And after a week we moved to fresh grazing land and then returned to Muryacyeru when the grass would have grown.  
Q.	On the 11th of April where did you graze your cattle, Witness? 
A.	On the 11th February I grazed the cattle not far from our house.  I could not take the cattle to graze in the valley because my security was not guaranteed.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, we heard 11th February in English.  
MR. MAWERE:
So did I, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you clarify that with the witness.  
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	Witness, did you talk of 11th February 1994? 
A.	No.  I, rather, talked of 11th April, not 11th February.  
Q.	Where did you graze your cattle on 18th April 1994? 
A.	In the vicinity of our home.  It was a period of insecurity.  People were killing one another.  I could not take the cattle to the valley during that time of insecurity.  
Q.	(By order of the Court this question and answer has been extracted and kept under separate cover) 
MR. MAWERE:
Karasanyi is number 16 on the spelling list, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Learned Counsel.  

Can we go into a short closed session?  
MR. MAWERE:
Okay.  Okay, Madam.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Members of the public, we request you to leave at this moment because we are going to address a matter that may identify the witness.
