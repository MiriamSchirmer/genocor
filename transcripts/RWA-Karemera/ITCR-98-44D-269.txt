MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody. 

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Tuesday, the 13th of April 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al., Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.

Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

The appearances are the same. 

Mr. Robinson, are you ready to make your motion?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You don't have to make it very lengthily.
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  I would just ask if the Trial Chamber is now in a position to order the admission of the five certified statements which were submitted on the 14th of December of 2009. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I think the Chamber's already made its decision.  So. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Judge -- Judge Joensen will give the Chamber's decision. 
JUDGE JOENSEN: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Our ruling is as follows:  By decisions of 15 July and 20 October 2009, the Chamber found a number of statements submitted by Joseph Nzirorera admissible under Rule 92 bis in their entirety or in part, subject to the disclosure of the identifying information of their authors and their certification, pursuant to 92 bis (B).  

On 14 December 2009 Joseph Nzirorera moved for five of the statements to be admitted and given exhibit numbers after providing the required identity information and certifications.  The Chamber grants the motion and admit the statements of the following witnesses:  Simpunga, Aloys; Bizimana, Madjaliwa; Sezibera, Célestin; Imananibishaka, except for paragraph 6 of the statement; and Litric Danko.  

Mr. Issa, will you give us the exhibit numbers. 
MR. MJUI: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  The first document will be D. NZ768.  The second document will be D. NZ769.  The third document will be D. NZ770.  Fourth document will be D. NZ771.  And fifth document will be D. NZ772.  Thank you, Your Honour.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ768 admitted) 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ769 admitted) 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ770 admitted) 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ771 admitted) 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ772 admitted) 
JUDGE JOENSEN: 
Thank you, Mr. Issa and Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Your testimony will continue.  I remind you that you are under the same oath you took to tell the truth and that you took when you began your testimony yesterday. 

Mr. Robinson will continue his examination. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, while we're in the process of marking the exhibits, I would ask that also the statement of Gratien Kabiligi, which was ordered admitted in March as an exhibit on the 7th of April, be D. NZ773 and the transcript of the testimony of Mark Ntigura, which was also ordered admitted and marked in your decision of the 7th of April be D. NZ774.  That way we will have all caught up of our prior statements to be admitted.  
There's nothing really the Chamber needs to do.  I'm just mostly doing this for Issa's benefit so that we keep them -- you've already ordered the numbers to be -- the exhibits to be marked.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Issa, are you on board?  
MR. MJUI: 
Yes, Your Honour.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So ordered.

GEORGES RUTAGANDA, 
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Good morning, Mr. Rutaganda.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	When you left off yesterday, you told us that you returned to Kigali on the 14th of April 1994.  Can you tell us what you did on that day.  
A.	All I did was travel from my home to Kigali, and I got to Kigali in the evening, the evening of the 14th. 
Q.	And where in Kigali did you stay that night? 
A.	When I arrived in Kigali, I was not able to go to my house in Kicukiro.  And I, therefore, had to go to Amgar, our property that was located in town. 
Q.	Can you tell us, what was Amgar?  What was located there, and where was it? 
A.	Amgar was a piece of property which our family had just acquired.  It included a number of buildings, a garage which was known as centre-ville auto.  There was a residential building.  And there was also some kind of temple for the Hindu people called Hindu mandal.  

And then there were offices which were used by our important business staff -- working through a company.  And that company held a significant stock of products for the Rutaganda business.  And this was, therefore, in fact, a business complex, if I could say so. 
Q.	Now, when you arrived there -- well, first of all, tell us where it was located.  In what part of Kigali? 
A.	Let me clarify that Amgar was not the name that we had assigned to that facility.  It hadn't been given a name yet.  But Amgar was the name of the former owner of that property.  And the property is located in Cyahafi secteur in Nyarugenge commune. 
Q.	Now, when you arrived there on the evening of the 14th, did you receive any information concerning Robert Kajuga? 
A.	Yes.  When I got there, I learnt that Kajuga was somewhere near the facilities of Amgar. 
Q.	Did you have any contact with him on the 14th? 
A.	Yes.  When he learnt that I was in town, he came to see me, and we chatted.  We had discussion during which he told me how he had encountered several difficulties and run into many problems and that he was now in hiding. 
Q.	Had any members of his family been killed from the 6th of April? 
A.	Yes.  He told me that his senior brother; his sister-in-law, that is, the brother's wife; and his father had been killed at Houss's house -- and Houss is Robert's senior brother -- that those people had been killed at his home, and that he had been blocked in Rugiro (sic) in his village, and that, when the RPF attacked the village, he and all those who were in the village Rubiro (sic) hotel had to forge a way out from the back of the hotel in order to be evacuated.  And that is how he was able to come to the location where I met him. 
Q.	And did he tell you approximately when it was that he was able to leave that area and come outside of the village? 
A.	He told me that he left on Sunday, Sunday, the 10th of April 1994. 
Q.	Now, we've had testimony that -- from a witness with a pseudonym of AJY that on Sunday, the 10th of April, Mr. Kajuga had arrived at the residence -- at a residence of Mr. Nzirorera near the German embassy in Kiyovu and had spent that day driving to an area known as Kabeza in which he picked up a number of Interahamwe along the way and then they slaughtered some Tutsis in Kabeza.  

Now, based on what Mr. Kajuga told you about his whereabouts, can you comment on whether that is likely to have been -- to have occurred. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I'm objecting to that question. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
That wasn't -- actually wasn't a very good way to ask that question.  I think I can do that over. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Did Mr. Kajuga tell you anything about what he had done on the Sunday, the 10th of April? 
A.	What he told me is what I have already narrated to you, namely, how they struggled to get out of Rugiro village in order to get to the location where he was.  That is the story he told me. 
Q.	And why was he in hiding? 
A.	Well, following what had happened to his family, and maybe relying on information that he had received, he must have felt frightened and then decided to go into hiding.  You see, he could not leave the location at which he was because, as he told me, he was afraid that he will encounter the same fate as his senior brother and his father. 
Q.	We've had testimony from Witness T that, on the evening of the 12th of April, Robert Kajuga joined Witness T and some others at the ministry -- at the ministry of defence where they collected some weapons which were later distributed to Interahamwe.  Did Mr. Kajuga ever tell you anything about that? 
A.	No.  He never mentioned anything to me about that.  But I can state that he could not go out, because, when I came from Masango to Kigali on the 14th in the evening, he was in hiding.  And, therefore, I do not know how he could have been able to travel around on the 12th; whereas, he was in hiding. 
Q.	We've had testimony from Witness G that weapons from that stock from the ministry of defence were given to you in order to distribute to other members of the Interahamwe national committee; is that true? 
A.	I did not receive any arms, neither from the ministry of defence nor from any other source.  I think that when we -- when it is said that Mr. Rutaganda received arms, we must understand that arms are not beans or stones that can be handed over just like that.  So I think whoever makes such a claim should be able to adduce evidence as to the receipt of those -- those weapons.  

In 2004 I wrote to the Prosecutor asking to be clarified on the source of the weapons which they claim I received.  And I didn't get any reply to that letter.  So I never received weapons, neither from the ministry of defence nor from any other source. 
Q.	Now, after your conversation with Robert Kajuga about his difficulties, what steps, if any, did you take to assist him? 
A.	I waited for the officer in charge of security in the central region, who was a soldier, to come by.  When I met him, I put the question to him and asked whether he had any difficulty with reassuring Kajuga.  And he said there was no problem, as such, and he also went on to say that he thought that he was working both for the RPF and for the government.  

So I told him that we have been together since 1991 and that I have personally monitored him and that I did not believe in the allegation that he was an RPF accomplice.  It was after that discussion that he told me that, if I knew where he was in hiding, I should tell him that there was no problem; that the issue was really rather with his parents so I -- or his relatives.  

So I went back to him and reassured him that there was no problem.  So he asked me to help him, to bring him to the public eye so that the public would know that he is around and, therefore, be able to enjoy his freedom as he went on.  That is how in the evening at about 5 p.m. we took a car and drove around from the -- from one roundabout to another, greeting people so that people could see him and know that he was around.  And that is evidence, in fact, that he had been in hiding for some time -- for a long time. 
Q.	And how long did he stay in the property near where you were at Amgar? 
A.	When Kajuga began to enjoy what I can refer to as that freedom, then he started going about and moving around as he deemed fit, as all others would do.  But he wasn't certain that, in spite of the guarantees that he had been given, he would not run into some problems because he didn't feel that the guarantee was complete and comprehensive.  So he surrounded himself with a group that accompanied him as he went about.  I also noticed later on that he went about with an escort, a vehicle ahead of him and one behind him.  

And so he worked with people at the roadblocks, and he also contacted the authorities that had appointed people to man the roadblocks.  So he also organised a number of excursions, evacuations, during which he would take his friends or people he felt that were in -- in danger to the Mille Collines.  So in the evening he would do that.  But if he was not able to reach the plateau which was where the Mille Collines was located, he would take them to Amgar and they would spend the night there.  

So the commander to whom I had made representations on that issue came to see me and told me that, "We know what Kajuga is doing, this transportation of people here and there and these evacuations that he is conducting are not in line with our security measures.  So we know that in the evenings he even brings people to Amgar.  So I want you to know that, if he continues with his line of activity and we become aware of it, we will teach you a lesson you will never forget." 

So I understood the message.  And I went to Kajuga, and I told him, "Be careful.  You remember how it is that we pulled you out of the situation in which you were when you were in hiding.  So please be careful and desist from -- be -- be very careful about the nature of operations that you want to engage in.  And if you want to do so, please make sure you do whatever operation with the consent of the commander who was in charge of the plateau." 

But rather than listen to me, he heeded the counsel of one of his friends, who was called Petit, and they decided to move out sometime during the week between the 17th and the 24th of April 1994.  So he decided to move out, and that is how he left to go stay at Moussa's house -- Moussa was also an accomplice of the parents of his friend who had advised him to leave -- rather than heed the counsel which I had given him. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
If I can interrupt.  If Mr. Robinson could enquire of the witness the name of the commander he's referring to. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	If you know that, Mr. Rutaganda, can you give that information.  
A.	I no longer recall the name, but it is easy to remember the person who was in charge of security at the Kigali plateau. 
Q.	Now, did you yourself take steps to evacuate or rescue people? 
A.	Which people?  
Q.	When you -- after you returned on the 14th of April to Kigali, from that time on, were there some people that you assisted to be evacuated or to find a place of refuge? 
A.	The evacuation action was an action which I would describe as being continuous.  Yesterday I stated that one of the reasons which forced me to return to Kigali was to seek for ways to -- to look for my mother and my sister who were -- were lost.  I found them at Red Cross in the refugee camp which had been set up at the Kiyovu neighbourhood.  I found them there, and I took them to my home in Amgar.  

When we left the Red Cross camp, some families had -- which had decided to follow us -- in spite of the fact that I had asked them to remain there, that they would be better off with the Red Cross, they chose to follow us.  And those families were Tutsis.  So we went together right to Amgar where they stayed for two to three days, and we decided -- we felt that it was better to evacuate them -- evacuate them to Masango.  That is my native area.  

That is the time when I took a Jeep belonging to a friend of mine, which was parked there.  I put my sisters in it, my mother, and we departed for Masango.  

Among those people you also had a lady, a lady whose husband had taken her to hospital.  She was seven month -- month's pregnant.  Her husband had taken her to hospital and abandoned her there.  

When we -- when people started -- open -- when people opened fire on the Kigali central hospital, he thought it wise to go to Amgar because that is not far from the hospital.  And he was with us and stayed with my family, my family members whom we had taken from the Red Cross.  And we went towards Masango.  It's only when we arrived Giticyinyoni that at the roadblock you had very close searching -- searches which -- and because of that, we did not go through.  

In the meantime, I waited with those manning the roadblock whose leader had ordered them not to allow us to go through that roadblock in spite of the fact that the people who were manning the roadblocks had told him that it was me, that it was the second vice-president of the Interahamwe who was escorted by vehicles and was coming along with a certain number of people, Tutsis.  So apparently, they answered him that at -- our time was past and we should not be taken care of, that -- that sort of thing.  

Now, when my sister was taken out of the car and that -- was being beaten, then I understood that the situation was grave.  So I paid some money to those people who were manning the gate so that they could at least allow us to return to Mugar (sic).  And he agreed, and that is how we returned to Amgar.  That is an example of an evacuation which I was involved in. 
Q.	Now, who was the person who was in charge of the roadblock in Giticyinyoni? 
A.	It was Setiba.  Setiba.  Because when I dropped the family, the couple -- when I returned to Amgar with the convoy, I went to find out what was happening and why we had not been let through and to try to establish the necessary contacts for the family to go through.  

When I got there, I was taken to Setiba's, and he pretended not to be aware of what had happened.  But ultimately, he asked me the question, "Did you give them something?"  I told him no, except at a time when we had to return to Kigali, I paid 5,000 francs.  And he told me, "That is why you were not granted permission to go through.  You needed to have given something."  

I -- so I asked him what was to be done.  He told me that something had to be paid to those people who were on the road, and, "You also have to give something.  That way I would arrange things."  And so I paid him 15,000 Rwandan francs.  And he told me that, "What about those people close to you?  Are -- are they not going to get some -- get something?"  So I added 5,000.  And he said, "What about the people on the road?"  So I added 5,000.  So ultimately, I paid 25,000, including the 5,000 I had paid the previous day, a total of 30,000.  

So he gave the order that, if he saw my -- if they saw my vehicle coming, they had to open the roadblock, which is what happened.  I returned and fetched my group.  When we arrived the roadblock, we -- nobody searched us.  Nobody looked into the car, and we went through the roadblock.  I drove the group right up to Ruyenzi, and then I returned to Kigali. 
Q.	And in the hierarchy of the Interahamwe, did Joseph Setiba take orders from you? 
A.	The word "authority" is a strong word.  But he was the president of the Interahamwe za MRND at that Giticyinyoni area.  He knew me very well.  Had he been under my authority, he wouldn't -- he wouldn't even have dared ask me to pay him money.  

Secondly, that he would have had me -- sent me back to Kigali where we spent the night that -- where there was total insecurity.  So when he does state himself that we were no longer in authority, our time was past; that is to say, there was no re -- there were no -- no longer any hierarchal relationship -- there was no longer any hierarchal relationship between himself -- him and I. 
Q.	Now, were there also people who you assisted to find refuge at the Mille Collines? 
A.	As a matter of fact, when I arrived at Amgar on the 14th, I met some people who had sought refuge inside.  Now, when I decided to leave Kigali, I felt I couldn't leave them behind because they would face difficulties in my absence.  And it is on that basis that we organised for them to be evacuated to areas where they felt secure -- they would be secure, especially the Mille Collines hospital -- hospital -- hospital, the Red Cross hospital which is found in Kiyovu.  

And even evacuating them to those places was -- was difficult.  I told you that I had a -- a saloon -- a Peugeot -- Peugeot 505 saloon car.  And we even had to carry them in the boot behind with the -- running the risk that they could be discovered at the roadblocks and be subjected to the worst sort of fate.  

But we would take them in the vehicle, and we would try to establish contact at each roadblock and ensure that we would be able to discuss correctly with the people at the roadblock.  I mean, based on the experience I had had with Setiba, maybe, you know, give them something to allow us through securely, considering our load -- I mean "our load" that we had in the boot. 
Q.	As second vice-president of the Interahamwe, didn't you have the authority to just order those people at the roadblocks to just do what you told them to do?  Why did you have to pay them money? 
A.	I didn't have any power to act at the roadblocks.  And I was not the only one in that situation.  The situation was such that I was considered as an ordinary person.  There was no exception.  Anyone who had to go through the roadblock had to come to it and be checked and controlled. 
Q.	Now, did you also have contact with the manager of the Mille Collines,***********************? 
A.	Yes.  I had several contacts with*******************, because, when I arrived, returning from Masango on the 14th, I tried to see if I could sell the stock of beer which I had.  And instead of evacuating it -- because it was difficult to get it through all those roadblocks -- whereas, everybody wanted -- was looking for beer.  So it was a difficult task to execute.  So I tried to sell it, and I found out that it was possible to do so.  And so I decided to sell the entire stock of beer.  And that is how people would line up.  There was no one else who was selling beer in the capital as the brewery was found in the north and the road had been blocked.  

It is on that cue that ***************a came in search of some crates of beer.  Of course, he didn't have cash -- money in cash.  So he proposed that he would giving me -- gave me a cheque as a guarantee and that the cheque would be payable -- cashed after the wars -- the war when banks opened.  

At the onset I hesitated because, firstly, he was not a usual client of mine.  As a matter of fact, there had been rumours that RPF and opposition people should not buy stuff from Rutaganda because that would be a way of assisting the Interahamwe.  And he had respected this order.  

So I asked him, "You usually do not come to buy.  How come you are coming now?  And then, further, you are giving me a cheque; whereas, there are people who are paying me in cash.  This is a wartime.  How can one know that banks would ever reopen?"  

But considering the personal relationship that I had with him -- he was a long-standing friend -- I gave in and handed him crates of beer and other products he wanted for, because he said he had some refugees at Mille Collines and who could hardly have any water to drink.  So as -- for humanitarian reasons I decided to give him -- give him what he wanted against a cheque which was meant to be a guarantee and which I would cash late -- I was supposed to cash later.  

He left.  And the next morning I went to the Hôtel des Mille Collines, which was the first time I was going there.  I went there.  I saw him.  As a matter of fact, I was going there to collect the cheque because he had not come with the cheque.  

I saw many people there whom I knew.  You had the older brother of Kajuga, people called Kamana, many people.  So I asked him.  He told me they had about 800 people.  

As a matter of fact, he took me upstairs, and I saw that some of -- some people were sleeping in the corridors because it was as comfortable as rooms.  And people organised themselves and slept there.  He told me that there were around 800 people.  

He gave me the cheque, and I went back to Amgar.  After some time, two or three days later, he came again.  He came and asked me for more.  And I said, "Okay.  Good and fine.  And I hope that, the first quantity I gave you, you didn't give it out free of charge."  So I told him, "If you have sold it, then you have to pay me so that I should give you the next stock."  He told me, "You know, I am sorry.  It is with that money that I'm going to buy food to feed the people you saw."  So I asked him, "How do you think I'm going to finance -- continue financing*************?" 

So I understood that he was also facing lots of difficulties.  So, once again, I agreed, and he gave me the second cheque, which I also went and collected like I did with the first.  So subsequently, we carried on such operations that ***************-- or, rather, the Hôtel des Mille Collines owed me over one million Rwandan francs at the time.  

That is the contact I had with him.  And I seized opportunity of meeting him to ask him to take some people whom I had at Amgar.  That is how I took the Butera, Anaclet family and one Gashayija, Justin, who was also in Amgar and many other people whom we were able to evacuate.  
Q.	Now, I'd like you to be shown Exhibit D. NZ34, which is a communiqué that was read on the radio in late April of 1994.  

Mr. Rutaganda, we have in evidence already a communiqué which was read on the radio attributed to you and Mr. Kajuga.  Do you remember that communiqué?  
A.	That is not the only communiqué that we released.  But I remember this one perfectly well. 
Q.	And in this communiqué can you tell us what it is that you are communicating and to whom.  
A.	The communiqué was an appeal we were making to the Interahamwe za MRN -- MRND. 
Q.	And what were you appealing them to do? 
A.	As a matter of fact, if you were to take a look at the contents of the communiqué, the appeal consisted in asking the Interahamwe za MRND who were found among the people -- among -- among those who were manning the roadblocks, that -- that, one, they had to respect the human being -- that is what we were trying to say to them -- and that if on -- if certain things that were not normal were found on humans, they were to take them to the administrative centres and that if there were even some who were involved in killings that they were to ask them to stop and that they were not to be involved in such activities.  

You also had the aspect -- as a matter of fact, this communiqué was initiated by the Red Cross -- the Red Cross, which was saying that they were facing difficulties when they were moving wounded people.  And if they were not assisted in convincing people at roadblocks that they should be let through -- that some were in agreement but that they wanted to talk to political parties in order to have some support, some assistance.  

So that is why we were stating in that communiqué -- that, if they had the means of facilitating the safe conduit of Red Cross vehicles, vehicles that carried wounded people, that -- namely, that they should be doing their work but they should not stop Red Cross vehicles with wounded people from going through.  So that's grosso modo the appeal which we launched, and it was broadcast over RTLM and over Radio Rwanda, which were the two radio stations found there at that time.  

I also recall that at the time that for a communiqué to be broadcast a payment had to be made and this payment was made by the Red Cross.  And as a matter of fact, it is the Red Cross that paid it.  

And so that is the communiqué of the 24th of April, I believe.  Instead of people blaming the Interahamwe za MRND, I believe that this is evidence of what was behind -- in our mind.  It is evidence of what was in our mind.  

Let me -- we cannot -- to quote Judge Kama, you can't be good and bad at the same time.  You cannot both ask people not to kill and not to be involved in killings and at the same time release communiqués asking people to -- to kill others.  That is -- that is the core of our thought in the Interahamwe; that is, we did not want to hurt anybody at all. 
Q.	Now, after you returned to Kigali on the 14th of April, did you have any contact with any members of UNAMIR? 
A.	I had several contacts with people from UNAMIR.  And as I said before, I had a sales point for beer, and some would just come to buy beer.  Others just came to spend time and discuss with people who were found.  And maybe they were on mission.  
But the most significant contact I hired were -- was that Kajuga and I were invited to attend a meeting at the Hôtel des Diplomates.  That was the first contact.  

And while I was in Amgar, I saw one****************, who was the ***************
****************************.  I was the -- Kajuga had asked me to go and attend a meeting at Hôtel des Diplomates.  I asked him what was on the agenda of the meeting, and he told me we would talk about it when we are at Hôtel des Diplomates.  

But this is a topic regarding the prevailing situation.  I was reluctant to go with him.  But Kajuga convinced me and -- "Let's go and hear what they have to tell us."  So we went there to the Hôtel des Diplomates.  And we sat around a table, and they started telling us how they felt we had to participate in negotiations with the RPF.  

Immediately, I replied and told them that, "Did you see me signing agreements in Arusha?  Did you see me in any meeting where they were talking about the Rwandan government and the RPF?  I believe that you are barking up the wrong tree.  You need, rather, to talk to the authority, to the government, the army, and whoever you choose.  But you are knocking at the wrong door if you are asking us to be involved in this." 

The meeting didn't last long.  And we went back, and he dropped me at the hotel -- at -- in Amgar.  That was the first time.  

About a month -- a -- a week or two later, he came back again.  And at that time, still along with Kajuga, he came and told me that they still had another meeting which they wanted us to attend, the same as the preceding time.  I asked for further information.  

Still I really -- I decided to go with Kajuga, and we went together right up to the Hôtel des Diplomates.  And then -- there, still in the same meeting hall and sitting at the table, what they were seeking for was for us to assist them in evacuating refugees who were found at the Hôtel des Mille Collines and who were -- who wanted to go to the RPF zones -- that they felt we were in a position to assist -- to help them in assisting those refugees.  

I told them, as I did the previous time, that we did not have any responsibility over the roadblocks.  And the proof is how we had been treated when we were both -- together we were going from Amgar to the Hôtel des Diplomates.  

And after having discussed that for a while, I told them -- I sent them -- I asked them to meet the -- the authorities and the individual people in charge of each roadblock and that they had to ensure that they have the prior authority.  Before taking the group of people, they had to ensure that each person who was in charge of the roadblock had given them their approval.  

I also promised him, that if they needed my assistance, to discuss with them that I was ready to come along with them to go and assist them in that regard when the time came.  They were satisfied.  They were happy with my proposal, and that is how the meeting ended.  We went back, and they dropped me off in Amgar, and he handed me a bottle of gin, though I didn't -- although I didn't drink gin.  And this was a sign of thanks, and he left.  

About one hour later he came back very angry, talking on his walkie-talkie, and he asked -- called me.  I left my home.  And I was in shorts and sandals.  I -- I didn't have -- I was not dressed to go out.  

He tried to force me into his Jeep, and I asked him to tell me where we were going.  He told me to get on board and he would tell me along -- along the way.  He -- he practically forced me into his Jeep.  

And we took the road leading from avenue de la justice right down to the main roundabout in Kigali.  And we reached a place known as SOPECYA Kanogo.  That is where you had the filling station where the refugees for whom we had -- for whom our assistance had been requested had been held down by a crowd of people which was an angry crowd of people, comprising soldiers, civilians.  

It was practically a war front.  Because while we were there -- this was basically a -- the front between the RPF and the others.  So that was a front.  And after which you got into the RPF zone.  

So when we reached there, as I alighted from the vehicle, everybody was shouting at me.  They were saying, "We know why you are coming here."  They were jeering and told -- telling me they know why "you came here based on the people who -- the person who brought you".  And I asked them, "What is happening?"  I found myself in shit.  

And I asked, "Are you chasing me away without even knowing why I came here?  You don't even know why -- what I have to tell you.  You don't even allow me to speak."  So they let me speak.  

So I told them -- since I cannot speak to an entire crowd, I asked for a group of five people to be set up.  I also found that there was a lady -- and we could discuss with that group.  So I discussed with that group and transmitted my message.  

So we went aside.  We discussed.  And I was told that -- that you had RPF accomplices who had now signed membership to RPF, and those are the people who had caused the problems for the country and that going to the RPF side was a sign that they had always been against the government.  

I tried to convince them and to tell them that the situation was such that the reason for which the administrative -- that, if the administrative authorities had authorised them to go, why not allow them to carry on their journey.  And as a matter of fact, I promised to pay them something in return, because I had had experience with Setiba, and I told them that, "If you let these people -- so then I would pay you something."  And the something I was referring to was to pay them or to give them something in return.  They agreed.  And they left.  

And when they went back and explained what we had agreed on, they were nearly lynched by the crowd.  And I was really discouraged.  And I told myself, "Well, maybe I should return to my home."  As a matter of fact, I was in my -- no concern of mine.  I didn't have to be responsible for -- for the matter.  But on the other hand, I felt, "Well, since you already stepped in so far, isn't there another way to act in order to be of assistance to those people."  

So I approached ********************who was even unable to get close to the crowd.  I got close to him, and I told him -- I asked him the question:  "Are you ready to use weapons?  Because those people are decided.  They are adamant."
(Pages 1 to 14 by Tanya West)


















1015H 
THE WITNESS (continued):
He told me he couldn't use weapons because they do not want us, they want those people.  I told them, "But they're in your vehicles.  If they attack your vehicles, it means they're attacking you, so you have to use force in order to ensure that the convoy was safe."  He told me that they could not do that unless they were directly attacked.  

But that situation put me in a situation in which I didn't know what to do.  I found myself on the ground in the middle of a crowd of people, most of whom were armed, including soldiers, and the tendency was for me to drop everything and leave.  

Fortunately, the préfet of Kigali, Renzaho, came in a double-cabin pickup.  Fortunately, it was a pickup with space behind.  So he -- he stood behind the pickup in order to look down on the crowd.  So it took him about 15 to 20 minutes to get the crowd to listen to him.  

When they calmed down, he said that those people were authorised by the government, that the army staff had given the green light, and that they should let them through to carry on their journey right up to the RPF.  The crowd became even more furious.  And when -- and to show how furious they were, they went to the truck carrying the refugees and punctured all the tyres, which was a clear indication that, "Mr. Préfet, we will never allow those people through."

That was catastrophic.  And, of course, I had listened to what had been said before those things happened and before the question was put to the préfet to the effect that he was saying that it was a counter-offer for the RPF to send "our own men to our side".  And they asked him whether he could provide such guarantees, and he was not in a position to do so.  So they asked him, "Mr. Préfet, if you release these people, how are we going to receive our own people?"  And he was not in a position to offer them any guarantees.  

So I understood that the best way to proceed was to align with the crowd and attempt to convince them.  It is true that they were right.  They had a good and valid argument in the context of what was being said at the time, because the proposal was that there was going to be an exchange of persons.  And the question was, where are the others?  And there was none to be seen.  

That is how I suggested then that the group of persons who had been trying to transit through be returned to the Hôtel des Mille Collines rather than insist on that.  So the idea would have been that the crowd had made up its mind to act later in the evening.  And so after that suggestion, he said that it was a good idea, and so I went back and suggested to the préfet on behalf of the crowd that those persons should be returned to the Hôtel des Mille Collines.  And upon saying that, I even suggested that the crowd could send people to monitor the location to which the refugees would be taken and that UNAMIR would also be involved in this exercise.  

So the response was spontaneous and the crowd agreed.  The problem, therefore, was to find the vehicles to take them back to the Hôtel des Mille Collines, since the tyres of their own cars or buses had been punctured.  

So some UNAMIR tanks and vehicles, which were used for transporting the Blue Berets, became available and then they were taken back.  They brought the vehicles close enough to the trucks, and the people who were in them jumped into the other vehicles.  They wanted to take their luggage, 
but if they had done so they would not have been able to get everything into the new vehicles.  Even 
*******************was also used for transporting these persons and other vehicles that were in the vicinity.  That is how they returned to Hôtel des Mille Collines.  

However, the vehicles that were at the petrol station were there, but others had gone through the roadblock already and were at the location below the flyover.  And that is how the préfet had to go there and inform them about what had been decided at SOPECYA.  

I remained at that location.  I did not have a vehicle.  Looking left and right, I was trying to understand what was happening.  So it occurred to me that checking with the UNAMIR vehicle we might find that some people might have been in hiding in those vehicles -- in -- in the cabin of those vehicles.  So I went into -- onto the truck and knocked on the vehicle and I saw something that looked like a young girl who was hiding in that vehicle.  

When I wanted to pull -- or to get her out, and I asked her to open -- open the -- the -- the vehicle, a soldier put a gun to my jaw and forced me to come down, ordering me not to touch that girl, because apparently he was the one who was in charge of monitoring that girl.  And I don't know what would have happened in the evening if that girl remained there.  

So this girl was in that vehicle and did not know that the others had left.  You can understand what I was going through.  So fortunately, as the soldier was getting me out of the vehicle -- down from the vehicle, I saw the préfet going by the flyover, so I beckoned him to come, and he came over and I pleaded with him to take that girl.  

And so this soldier, who was bearing a gun with a rocket launcher, he threatened that if he dared to take the girl, he would deal with the préfet.  That was quite serious and it was already evening.  And, fortunately, the commander of the operations in Kigali happened to be passing by and the préfet called him over.  These were all senior military officers.  And the préfet informed him of what was happening, and therefore said that the soldier in question be promptly disarmed and undressed -- that is, the soldier who had dared to attack us.  So that is how the little girl was taken out of the -- that truck and put into the préfet's vehicle.  

When Colonel Muberuka gave the order, the -- Muberuka, rather, gave that order, the préfet was able to put that girl in his vehicle and take her away.  That is how I remained in that location until I asked Colonel Muberuka to take me along in his Jeep.  

So the people to whom I had promised something reminded me that I was owing them something, although we had not succeeded in getting those people to cross over.  And so they all tried to get into the Jeep, but as they surrounded us, I was able to leave that place with Colonel Muberuka until we got to Amgar.  So those people, who were not able to enter the Jeep as we took off, used a short cut to get to Amgar.  And when I got there, I thanked Colonel Muberuka for taking me to Amgar.  

And then the only remaining issue was to provide some reward to those people who had come.  I gave them five cartons of beer and they said it was not enough.  And they said, "Oh, we have worked very hard for you."  I added two more cartons and then I gave up to ten cartons, and then they left.  

So the day after, I went to Hôtel des Mille Collines to find out the state in which those people were.  I found them chatting and talking.  And they called for me and told me that they will never forget what I have done for them and also that this would be something that their children and their families would always remember.  

I'm referring particularly to Dr. Jean Gasasira; Mulindangabo, Ambroise; Habiyakare and others.  And while we were chatting, there was a -- a request to see me in an office.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We missed the name of the person who invited.  
THE WITNESS:
Now, the person said, "We wanted -- I wanted to tell you that you deserve our thanks because all those who were involved in that convoy have told me to thank you, and they will also remember what you have done."  It is at that point that this person informed me that his wife and his children were also part of that convoy.  

So in -- in very broad strokes, those were the contacts that I had with UNAMIR and the surrounding activities that occurred at that time.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And the person in whose office you were at the Mille Collines, the interpreters didn't catch the name. That was************************; is that correct? 
A.	A short while ago I was saying that those whom I met at the Hôtel des Mille Collines, who were having a discussion in a group, were made up of the following, among others, since there were many of them, but I remember Dr. Gasasira, Jean-Baptiste -- and I had many difficulties with his family in 1994 -- Mulindangabo, Amboise; Habiyakare, François.  

I must tell the Court that even in 1999 I wrote an open letter to the Gasasira family providing copies to all their friends asking that they intervene.  But there was no follow-up.  I believe that the 
Office of the President is in possession of this letter.  At that time, Judge Laity Kama had acknowledged receipt of the said letter in which I talked about the separate and joint contacts which I had had with members of that family in which I indicated how I had spared no effort to try to help them.  
Q.	You told us about a conversation with the person at the Mille Collines who told you that his wife and children had been on board that convoy, and the interpreters missed the name of the person who told you that.  Can you give us that name? 
A.	*************************.  
Q.	And the name of the colonel who took you back to Amgar was Muberuka; correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  Muberuka.  
Q.	Okay.  This incident took place on the 3rd of May; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  It must have been on the 3rd of May.  I became aware of the date later on following what I read.  But what I remember clearly is that it happened in early May.  
Q.	And were the people from the Mille Collines eventually successfully evacuated to the RPF side? 
A.	Yes.  Later on, I learnt that another evacuation was conducted simultaneously with the evacuation of other refugees who were on the RPF side who wanted to cross over to the government side.  But I wasn't part of that operation. 
Q.	We have had testimony in this trial that at the end of April 1994, you attended a meeting at the préfecture office in Kigali in which Mr. Nzirorera and the préfet presided over a meeting of conseillers and Interahamwe in which Mr. Nzirorera thanked the Interahamwe for the job they had done killing the Tutsis.  Is that true? 
A.	That is not correct.  First of all, I must tell you that I am not aware of any meeting at which the persons you have mentioned may have been convened to.  I am not aware of a meeting to which the Interahamwe were invited.  To my mind, I -- I must wonder in what capacity I would have been invited to such a meeting.  The simple answer is that I never attended any such meeting either at the préfectoral or communal level.  No, that couldn't have been.  

You see, what happens is that people want to lend some credence and importance to the 
Interahamwe za MRND, whereas they didn't have such credence.  You see, matters of security, control, monitoring and strategy were not handled by the Interahamwe za MRND.  That was not our business.  
Q.	Did you ever hear of such a meeting taking place in which Mr. Nzirorera had thanked the Interahamwe in Kigali? 
A.	No.  I did not hear mention of any such meeting, not even when we were still back home.  I think this is part of all those fabrications that seek to establish linkages between persons and events and which presume that Nzirorera may have attended such a meeting at which he thanked the MRND -- the Interahamwe za MRND.  

Well, I -- I -- this is quite embarrassing because I do not know how, even if he had been present at such a meeting, he would have given money and thanked the Interahamwe or given something to a subordinate, whereas, if I had been present, he would have given the money to me.  If I had been -- if he had been there, he would have talked to me and he would have given that money to me, rather than to give it to a subordinate and I would have been the one to coordinate that work with the Interahamwe.  

We must be realistic.  You know, for meetings to hold, there was a manner in which the meeting would be convened.  And there were lists of persons to be invited.  So how would I have attended a security or monitoring meeting at the préfectoral level?  In what capacity would I have attended such a security meeting? 

Let me tell you that even Préfet Renzaho did not know me very well.  He knew very little of me. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, would you like to take the mid-morning recess at this time? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we can take our mid-morning recess.  

How much time do you think you need, Mr. Robinson?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I think about 30 minutes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take our mid-morning recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1032H to 1056H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may continue, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Rutaganda, I now want to ask you about contacts you had with the three Accused after the 6th of April 1994, and we'll start with Mr. Nzirorera.  Can you tell us what contact you had with Joseph Nzirorera after the 6th of April 1994.  
A.	I did not have any contacts with Nzirorera, Joseph.  
Q.	We've had testimony from a Witness HH that meetings were held in Murambi, Gitarama after the interim government had left there -- left Kigali in April 1994, and that you were in attendance at those meetings along with Joseph Setiba, Nzirorera and Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Is that true? 
A.	That is not correct.  I never went to Murambi to attend any meeting with those persons whom you have mentioned.  I do not see any reason for which I would have gone to Murambi.  The situation was such that matters of security were not being handled by Interahamwe za MRND, so that was not part of my business or my duty.  
Q.	Did you have any contact with Édouard Karemera after the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	No.  I did not have any contact with Karemera either after the 6th of April.  That is my answer.  
Q.	And did you have any contact with Mathieu Ngirumpatse after the 6th of April? 
A.	No.  I did not have any contact with Mathieu Ngirumpatse after the 6th of April. 
Q.	Did Mathieu Ngirumpatse ever come to Amgar garage after the 6th of April? 
A.	He did not come either before the 6th or after the 6th of April.  He never came to Amgar garage.  
Q.	Do you know of any role that any of the three Accused played in the killing of Tutsis after the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	I am not aware of any role they may have played.  And as I have already told you yesterday, people felt that political leaders, including those of the MRND, were more concerned with matters of governance and government more than that of the return of members of their own parties.  The -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, if the witness would be asked to repeat his answer, the interpreters did not quite get the full answer. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	You're being asked to repeat your answer.  The interpreters didn't get it.  
A.	What I was saying was that I am not aware of any role that those three, Nzirorera, Ngirumpatse and Karemera -- well, they did not play any role as far as the killings are concerned and as far as I know.  I went on to say that within the population, when people talked, there was a feeling that political leaders, including those of the MRND, were more concerned with the business of government and what the government was doing in Murambi rather than what was happening within the population.  
Q.	And did the three Accused have control over those people who were doing the killing in Kigali after the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	No.  On that point, my answer is categorical.  I was there, and where I was we did not receive any orders from them to kill people.  As I said a short while ago, we did not see them, and they could not give any orders when we did not see them appear to talk to the population directly.  All we heard was announcements over the radio.  I was present.  I saw what was going on, and I never saw any of them talk to people either at roadblocks or elsewhere.  So my answer is categorical.  The killings happened as they did, but I am saying that I did not see those three play any direct role in the killings in Kigali.  
Q.	Did they have the ability to prevent or prevent the killings or punish those who were killing? 
A.	I don't know in what capacity they would have acted to punish the perpetrators of those killings.  A political party as the MRND can intervene regarding its members to the extent that it calls on its members and supporters to abstain from involvement in the killings.  I think that is what they did through their radio announcements on behalf of the party.  We also did the same by calling on people to heed the messages that had been sent out to them.  

Now, whether they choose to obey or not is another issue completely.  For example, if you are at a roadblock and you recognise someone who is an Interahamwe hurting someone or trying to hurt someone, and I tell them, "Please, do not do that," and yet they proceed in doing it, what can I do?  What can I do if I am not an administrative authority, if I don't have any force -- coercive force that I can use against that individual?  What else can I do? 

All I can do is report to the party that such an individual is a criminal and a killer.  And so the party will apply its various instruments, particularly expulsion in such cases.  But I don't know whether the party had the time to do so.  At that time, they did not have any forces behind them.  They didn't have any security forces behind them and therefore did not have any ability to punish and prevent or even halt these activities.  

So all they could do at the time was to call on those who were involved in those killings, who were part of those groups of killers -- was simply to call on them to stop what they were doing because that did not comply with party practice and policy.  And I think that this was done.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Rutaganda.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I have no further questions.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.  

Is there any other Defence team that wish to put questions to this witness? 
MR. SOW:
No, Mr. President.  No questions for this witness.  I think Mr. Robinson has covered all the ground, including the questions that I would have wished to put to the witness.  Thank you. 

MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, although our learned colleague has covered the entire scope of questions that I would have liked to put to the witness, I still would like to obtain some clarification from Mr. Rutaganda, who's present here.  And so I have a few questions for this witness, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please proceed.  

Mr. Witness, you now have to respond to counsel for Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Rutaganda.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	I have a few questions for you not very long in nature.  My first question relates to the beginning or the inception of the Interahamwe movement.  Could you please confirm or reject the information before this Trial Chamber from a Prosecution witness to the effect that at its inception, the movement which was known as Interahamwe was made up of children of influential members of the MRND.  Can you confirm that information?  Was that the configuration of the youth who met to set up that movement, which would subsequently be known as the Interahamwe, or did things happen differently? 
A.	Yesterday in my testimony, I stated that at the very beginning the movement, which would end up being known as the Interahamwe za MRND, there was no youth component as such because from the list that you saw -- or which I gave yesterday, the group was not youth-based, as such.  It was simply a group of intellectuals, heads of Crown corporations or parastatal enterprises who had come together as a think tank to see how the party could develop consistent, coherent strategies in the light of the advent of multiparty politics.  

So we noticed that other political parties had their strategies in place, and we saw how they were conducting their business and how the MRND was lagging behind.  And that is how it happened that those who held certain positions came together as a think tank.  So in answer to your question, there was no business of children of the leaders of the MRND being involved in the creation of the MRND -- of the Interahamwe za MRND.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, subsequently as the movement evolved, did you notice that members of the MRND tried to recover or recuperate your idea and introduce their children into the meetings in order to give them a better control of that movement? 
A.	No.  It was not my impression or feeling that anybody wanted to take over the project as such.  What we need to note is that as the movement evolved, the MRND, which had previously intended to create a youth wing of the party, ended up with a number of youth who had signed up as members of the MRND, even if there were older people involved as well.  And that is how things evolved from that 
think tank to the extent that those who had the initial idea took second place as a new structure evolved involving the youth of the party.  

I think that this phenomenon is one which one could refer to as a spontaneous evolution arising from the mobilisation of members of the party.  And it so happened that youth and children of the leaders of the party who had chosen to belong to the MRND -- because there were some who had chosen to belong elsewhere -- became members of the Interahamwe movement.  

I do not think that there was an official position whereby the children of the MRND leaders were co-opted, so to speak, as members of the Interahamwe.  What I can say is that the Interahamwe were active members of the party who wanted to inject mobilisation into the party and to prepare for the upcoming election campaigns.  
Q.	Could you tell us whether the initiators, who now took a second position or second role, as you have explained in your answer -- can you tell us whether those initiators became bitter and expressed their bitterness throughout that period during which the party was growing?  
A.	Well, I do not think that you can put your finger on any specific initiators as such because it all happened as the party grew.  It is a phenomenon that grew with the party because people were thirsty, they were longing for a forum to express themselves, and the attendant consequence was that the movement expanded rapidly at the secteur levels, particularly in Kigali.  

Opposition political parties, which had succeeded in silencing or threatening or even singing songs of victory over the MRND, did not accept that rapid change because they noticed that there was a rapid and multiplying effect on the MRND as people emerged from their "hiding".  Hiding quote/unquote.  
So they did not decide to deliberately destroy the Interahamwe movement.  But that was the basis of the conflict which arose after the April 1992 congress.  
Q.	Thank you.  Yesterday, you talked about Jean-Pierre Turatsinze or Abubakar Turatsinze, and you said that he was a driver.  Are you -- he was the driver and the mailman.  Are you aware of the fact that he was part of the Interahamwe committee in charge of coordinating the national executive secretary of the MRND and the Interahamwe?  This was the testimony of one of the Prosecution witnesses.  Were you aware of that? 
A.	I believe that this witness did not know the situation.  So the answer is negative.  Turatsinze was there, but he was never a coordinator.  He was never a member of the national provisional Interahamwe committee.  He was never a member of the préfectoral committee of the Interahamwe.  So I do not know how he could have become a coordinator.  

What I explained to you, as far as I understand, is that I saw him at the party headquarters working as a driver and a mailman, and if this is what amounts to coordination, then I do not know.  And he was not working only for the Interahamwe, but I think he is the one who served mail on other -- on various ministries on behalf of the party.  So he was never a coordinator.  He was never a president with the Interahamwe za MRND.  
Q.	Thank you.  Another question for you on the election of Setiba.  Did you attend any meeting at the Kabuga building at which Setiba was elected to the position of officer in charge of discipline within the Interahamwe in early 1993?  That is the date at which the meeting is alleged to have been held.  
A.	I did not attend that meeting.  And I am not aware of any position of discipline within the 
Interahamwe za MRND.  If he had been elected to such a position in my absence and such a position had been institutionalised, I would definitely have been made aware of that decision.  So this is the 
	first time I hear mention of this matter of a discipline committee within the Interahamwe za MRND.  
Q.	One last question on Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  My learned colleague Robinson put a number of questions to you seeking to find out whether you met him or not after the 6th of April.  You answered as you did.  Now, I want to ask you whether you were one of those who regularly visited Mr. Ngirumpatse.  
A.	Let me say that we lived in the same neighbourhood in Kicukiro, and that applies for Mr. Karemera as well.  But I never went to his home and he has never been to my home.  That must tell you that we did not visit with each other as such.  So I saw him as a figure of authority.  I had respect for him, as should be, and that was it.  

I never felt any desire -- and that might be in my nature -- I never felt obligated or under any duty 
to rub shoulders with persons who were older than me and who were in charge.  So he had to assess and appreciate me in my position and I appreciated him in his position.  So that is my answer to your question.  
Q.	Another question for you, Witness, now relating to the development of the Interahamwe movement.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse has been referred to as the one who tried to recuperate the 
Interahamwe movement.  Can you confirm that?  Can you state whether you noticed that 
Ngirumpatse was the mind behind the recuperation of the Interahamwe by the MRND? 
A.	When you say "recuperation", I think that it is a poor choice of word.  The Interahamwe za MRND as a movement in itself puts the movement within the party, so the Interahamwe za MRND could never have existed outside of the party.  So why would he have -- how and when would he have tried to recuperate the movement, whereas, the movement was a de facto structure of the party?  I don't understand.  So the whole idea of recuperation is incorrect.  
Q.	My understanding then, Mr. Witness, is that it is your position that the Interahamwe movement could not have been recuperated because it bore allegiance to the political ideas that arose within the multiparty context represented by the MRND.  
A.	Yes.  The Interahamwe za MRND was an integral part of the MRND.  There was no distinction to be made because we did not have ideals to ourselves that were distinct to our group.  So there was no need for any recuperation.  Whenever the Interahamwe za MRND acted, it reported to the party and informed the party accordingly, particularly because we -- it was the same party.  Whether there was success or failure, it was the same party that would benefit from whatever transpired.  
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Rutaganda.  That will be all.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, just as a matter of clarification, we have not fully understood your question surrounding the concept of recuperating the MRND.  Could you explain what you meant by that terminology? 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Gladly, Mr. President.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Rutaganda, I would like to explain the concept of recuperation so that the Trial Chamber may be fully aware of what we are referring to.  

In recent correspondences that we have received, it emerges that the Prosecutor has indicated that through disclosed documents Mr. Ngirumpatse was the person through whom the Interahamwe -- which had wanted to be independent of the MRND -- that the Interahamwe should come back or reintegrate the MRND and used the expression recuperation of those youth and their ideas because they had wanted to exist independently of the MRND without being confused for the MRND.  

This is a rather confusing point, and that is why I asked you about the recuperation of the movement that would ultimately be known as the Interahamwe.  That is how I encapsulated all of that concept -- all of those ideas into the concept of recuperating the Interahamwe movement into the MRND.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I don't know whether Mr. Rutaganda understood my question in that light.  But I would think that the answers that he provided were along the lines of the meaning intended in the question.  
THE WITNESS:
My understanding of the question by Counsel Chantal is that people may have thought that the Interahamwe movement was a separate structure which wanted to be independent and that Mathieu is the one who brought them back or who recuperated them -- that's the word again -- into the MRND, into the party.  And I said that this was incorrect.  This was not true because that was never the case.  
That approach never took place.  

From the very beginning, we did not want to be separate from the party because we were members of the MRND political party initially, and we simply wanted to bring our contribution to bear on the party as intellectuals and as business persons using our think tank.  

But then this evolved into what became the Interahamwe za MRND, the active wing of the party.  We remained members of the party and we never acted outside of the party.  If ever there was an activity scheduled by the party, we were part and parcel of it.  We never organised any meetings outside the party forum.  

Whenever we wrote any letters, the party was informed accordingly.  So we were not operating outside of the party.  And anybody who claims that there was a recuperation or a bringing back into the fold, that would be incorrect.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Thank you, Ms. Hounkpatin. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Is that more clear, Mr. President? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is.  Thank you.  

Now, Mr. Witness, the time has come for you to be cross-examined.  And the Prosecutor will have an opportunity to put some questions to you and you will have to respond to him. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Your Honours, the entire examination of chief of Mr. Rutaganda lasted five hours 30 minutes.  
Five hours 30 minutes.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.  

I'm a bit surprised by the smile on your face. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, Your Honours, I was thinking about something.  I'll proceed.  Let me just begin by saying 
good morning to everyone.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And I'll introduce myself to you, Mr. Rutaganda.  My name is Don Webster and I'm the -- the Prosecution counsel that will ask you questions.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Before I begin, if I could have the assistance of Mr. Issa to distribute some materials that I've compiled.  We may not need all of them.  It's a rather bulky package, but I assure you that we're not going to have to go through everything.  

So if Mr. Issa could help me provide copies to the Defence and a copy each to the interpreters and the Chamber.  

And I'll also indicate for the record that this morning I took note of other documents that may be of interest to us, and since they weren't copied, I sent them to the parties by email.  

And there's also the issue of a French translation of the Trial Chamber judgement for Mr. Rutaganda, which is not available in my bundle but which the parties can consult on their own.  So if anyone needs the Trial Chamber judgement in the French text, they'll have to acquire it, or I can also send it by email, but it's not included in the printed materials.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Rutaganda, I suggest to you that you're a very experienced witness; that this is certainly not your first time as a witness before this Tribunal.  You testified in your case over the course of five days from the 8th to the 23rd of April 1999; you also testified in the Zigiranyirazo trial as a Defence witness on the 6th and 7th of December 2006; you wrote and published a book in 2005 which addressed some of the issues in your own trial; and you've also been immortalised in cinema because you were a character in the Hollywood movie, Hotel Rwanda, which came out a few years ago.  Right? 
A.	An experienced witness, that is a bit outlandish.  But as for the rest, I am in agreement.  I testified in my trial.  I testified in the Zigiranyirazo trial -- and, you will recall that he was acquitted.  Yes, I also wrote a pamphlet.  It's not a book because it was not published.  It was the ten -- in celebration, it was the 
ten years of -- the celebration of ten years of injustice towards me.  

Yes, I am described in the film Hotel Rwanda.  I am falsely described as the villain whom I was (sic), and the proof is that this was written by people who were present, notably, UNAMIR, which represented the international community.  And I'm sure, Mr. Prosecutor, you are aware and con -- of -- of their affidavits.  
Q.	Well, my understanding is that the movie was actually based on the life experience of ***********************, who you have mentioned in your direct examination.  But all the same, it's a Hollywood film.  I'm not going to hold you to the characterisation that was made of you in that film.  We'll try to focus on your own sworn statements and the statements that you signed or were attributed to you from the events of 1994.  That will be the basis of my cross-examination.  

When you testified in the past, did you make an effort to be truthful and accurate in your testimony? 
A.	I didn't have to make an effort.  When I swear to speak the truth, that's what I do.  So the effort I make is to speak about what I witnessed as an eyewitness or to state my opinions on things that I went through myself.  It has nothing to do with making an effort to speak the truth.  
Q.	You testified previously that the Interahamwe za MRND was controlled by the MRND party.  I believe that's basically the point you were trying to clarify for Ms. Hounkpatin a moment ago.  But if we were to look back to your testimony from the 8th of April 1999, there is your response to Judge Aspegren that you would do nothing outside of the party, that the Interahamwe za MRND is the party itself.  That's essentially what you told us a few minutes ago, isn't it?  Or would you like to clarify that point?  
A.	I don't quite understand your question because I have never stated that the Interahamwe movement was out of the party, be it in April 1999, be it in my testimony before the present Trial Chamber.  
Q.	Well, thank you for that because I thought we were going to have trouble with that point, but you've made it quite clear.  When Ms. Hounkpatin was talking about recuperation of the Interahamwe, she was actually addressing a term used by Desiré Murenzi.  You know him, don't you? 
A.	Yes, I know Desiré Murenzi, but I don't know the term that he used.  
Q.	Well, Desiré Murenzi admits to being the person that initiated the Interahamwe by calling together several friends to discuss motivating the youth of the MRND to support the party.  So he actually takes credit for starting the Interahamwe organisation, but he claims that what he started, the innocuous organisation that he started, was recuperated by Mathieu Ngirumpatse and the family of President Habyarimana and turned into something quite different from what he had original proposed.  

And with that clarification in mind, do you want to address the point that the Chamber was interested in from a few minutes ago, the idea of what was initially a good thing, a discussion group, being turned into a vehicle of the MRND party?  
A.	I can only make comments, as I am not the author of that version.  If Murenzi stated that, then, firstly, when he resigned from the MRND, he was unhappy when he left.  He wasn't happy at all.  And -- but he did not -- indeed -- indeed, it is up -- only now that I understand why he left.  But what I was going to say is that at the time he was leaving, he didn't tell us why he was leaving.  

Now, to claim that the discussion group or the think tank group was there to set up a youth wing of the party, I -- that was not what I thought.  If I did, I would not have accepted.  Secondly, when the 
think tank group became a movement within the party, I don't believe that Murenzi could have felt that it is -- that that political weight belonged to him.  

Under no circumstances, we -- did we perceive things out of the party, and he's aware of that.  And at the time he was a member of the national committee and he is -- indeed, was the one who convened people and got them interested in setting up that think tank group.  And I believe that this statement by Murenzi comes from the fact that he made it a posteriori because he wants to disassociate himself from a movement which he initiated himself.  

In my view that is what it is; otherwise, I wouldn't see why he would disassociate himself from the Interahamwe za MRND -- and it attributed (sic) to Mr. Ngirumpatse.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you're going a little bit fast for the reporters, so please slow down a bit.  
THE WITNESS:
In brief, and to conclude my answer to Ngirumpatse's counsel, the feeling I -- I don't have the feeling that there is any form of recuperation by any person what -- whatsoever.  Indeed, and in effect, the existence of the Interahamwe za MRND in the préfet (sic) of the Kigali city in -- for which Mathieu was president and the assessment of that movement -- or the appreciation of that movement by the entire party and the will to institutionalise it at national level was to the credit of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  

And that was unavoidable because the Interahamwe were founded in his préfecture, the préfecture he was in charge of, and I don't find any difficulty to reach that conclusion.  But to describe it as a recuperation, I think that is an overstatement.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Is it your testimony that you didn't know why Murenzi had resigned from the MRND party in 
July of 1992? 
A.	As far as I'm aware, I didn't know why he left, but there were rumours that his life was threatened and that a bomb or a grenade had exploded in PETRORWANDA.  And he had concluded that it was a -- a threat, maybe not because he was in the MRND and an influential member of the Interahamwe za MRND, he felt threatened and he preferred to adopt a neutral position.  
Q.	Well, that's a partial summary of how Mr. Murenzi himself describes it because he does claim that he was threatened.  He was -- for him it was not a matter of rumour.  Persons within the party told him that his life was in danger.  He left the country and there was, in fact, an attempt against his life, all in relation to his opposition to what he saw as the new development in the MRND and the Interahamwe.  That's true, isn't it? 
A.	If you say so.  You are the one who's saying so.  And I would like to enquire from the Trial Chamber if I can have access to the references made by the Prosecutor and if I may be granted time to analyse them, because he's asking me questions and throwing things at me I am unaware of and trying to get me to accept.  In other words, he's forcing Murenzi's words into my mouth.  

If you wanted Murenzi's testimony, I believe the Prosecutor would have called him -- or maybe he has called him.  I don't know.  
Q.	Well, since you've asked for references, I will read to you a portion of his statement.  It's a statement from June of 2004.  I'm looking at paragraphs 47 and 48 of the statement, and I'll read it in French, since we don't have an English translation.  

A question was put to him.  This is a question at paragraph 47, and it is as follows:  "Personally, do you believe that the members of the Interahamwe national commission were in a position to take unilateral decisions without the approval of the other MRND authorities?"

His answer:  "At the beginning, yes, but only within the framework of the initial goal.  But subsequently they were manipulated, and so they could only depend on other decision makers, including 
Mathieu Ngirumpatse; Karemera, Édouard; François Karera; Nzirorera, Joseph and so on and so forth."

The following question, 48:  "Do you have the feeling, Mr. Murenzi, that when these same leaders incited you to set up this movement, they were unaware in December 1991 what goal this movement was meant for?"

Answer:  "Once more, no one incited me to set up this movement.  They -- they -- they used it to their own ends when it existed, and they moved away from the initial goal.  They certainly had an idea what they wanted to use it for when they started to take an interest in it.  This movement was recuperated and used for their own purposes, for purposes which had been elaborated before."

So that's where this line of enquiry is coming from, Mr. Rutaganda, if you'd like to comment now.  
A.	My understanding of that quotation -- that citation is that Murenzi was disappointed, that, firstly, he wrongly understood the meaning of the organisation.  He felt that he could also use it to earn political credit within the party and that was not the case, because instead of being a fundamental 
think tank group which was set up, it was converted into a mass movement of party movements, mainly bringing together the youth.  

I believe that surely there was some form of rivalry -- what I see is some form of political rivalry between Mathieu Ngirumpatse and -- and Murenzi.  And Murenzi who has seen that political -- despoiled of that political form -- force and he gets frustrated and leaves.  And I classify it as a rivalry because they come from the same stronghold, the same political area.  

So to talk about a form of recuperation, indeed, I told you a while ago that the existence of that movement was an approach which was appreciated not only within the political party, but within opposition parties.  Clearly, it could not have been attributed to Mathieu Ngirumpatse in that specific case.  

Now, the fact that Murenzi emerged, whereas -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
No -- sorry, I think the witness meant to say:  "Whereas Murenzi was submerged while he wanted to emerge, he felt frustrated." 

BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  Can you give us some idea of when the Interahamwe za MRND changed from a discussion group into a mass movement?  When would you situate that in time? 
A.	It didn't last long.  It's just at the very onset, even as Murenzi was still there -- at the time when 
Murenzi was still there.  You could put it at December 1991, because the organisation of the 
end-of-year festivity, it had already become massive.  Many people had already joined and this had brought us to ask Interahamwe members to organise themselves in their various secteurs.  I believe it was around December that we started to have many people joining.  
Q.	So that would mean within a month and a half of your starting to attend meetings, what started out as a discussion group among 15 or 20 people developed into this larger organisation.  Is that your testimony? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	Well, that corresponds to -- exactly to what Murenzi says.  He claims that you as a group started weekly discussions sometime around October-November of 1991, and by mid-December 1991 you'd been summoned by President Habyarimana to a meeting at his home.  And it's at that point he identifies that meeting with Habyarimana as the turning point in the organisation.  Do you agree with that? 
A.	No.  As a matter of fact, when our group was founded, this reflection group, you had some rumours to the effect that we were trying to set up our own political party to leave the MRND as it had been weakened.  Others were saying that we -- we were the youth wing of the MRND party.  But that was not the truth.  The truth is that we wanted to sit down and contribute.  

As a matter of fact, that presidential invitation was executed by Murenzi.  He's the one who came and told us that the president would like to meet us.  And at no point in time did I feel or -- or see any form of recuperation or the -- the intention by the president to attract, because we were already within the party.  

Murenzi was a member of the political committee of the party.  We were members of the party and we wanted to get -- we were working for the good of the party, so I cannot see how he could have tried to hurt the party.  So at that time he didn't want us to say we were going off course and we're going to miss our target, our fundamental target.  He was happy and proud.  And I don't think that he's going to say the contrary now.  
Q.	Then in your last response -- or in a previous response you talked about meetings of the Interahamwe at the secteural level.  When that began to happen, who controlled the Interahamwe organisation at the secteur level?  Was it your committee or was it the MRND party at the secteur level? 
A.	When the Wednesday meetings became unmanageable because there were too many people, we suggested that each group should set up its cell at the level of its secteur, its administrative secteur.  And they got together and elected their committee.  

Now, the coordination of Interahamwe activities at secteur level was ensured by these 
committees which had been set up, and, of course, under the auspices of -- as in the case of the national committee, by the leader in that secteur.  
Q.	I'm not sure if I understood the last portion of your response.  But what I would gather is that the meetings or the organisation of the Interahamwe at the secteur level was governed by the MRND party at the secteur level.  Isn't that so? 
A.	What I said is that the Interahamwe at the secteur level had their committee and it was that committee that was in charge of the organisation of its members, of course, as was the case with the 
national committee under the supervision of the local MRND political authority.  
Q.	Thank you.  That's the point I wanted us to reach, that ultimately it was the party at the secteur level that was governing the Interahamwe organisation at the secteur level, just as the party -- the national authority of the party were governing what your committee did at the national level.  Right? 
A.	Yes -- no, sorry.  But it's an overstatement to say that orders were given.  We took the initiative and we executed the things that we thought was appropriate and we informed the MRND about it.  I don't know what the Prosecutor means when he insinuates that there was some form of governance from the 
party -- orders from the party. 
(Pages 15 to 32 by Jean Baigent)





















1200H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Ultimately the Interahamwe, at whatever level, the secteur level, the communal level, the 
national level -- they responded to the authority of MRND party officials.  That's the point we are getting to, Mr. Witness.  You would agree with that, wouldn't you? 
A.	"Depended", I believe, Mr. Prosecutor, is an overstatement.  I explained yesterday how things were done.  It was through appeals.  I explained and I gave you the example of people, for example, who were called to come and attend a meeting, and I told you that they were organised to go to Kibungo.  You had no constraint, no coercive power over those people.  

When you talk about authority or governance, it is as if you are imposing the military, judicial or administrative authority, which wasn't the case.  The Interahamwe in Gikondo or any other given secteur were completely independent.  They acted depending on their own interests in their secteurs.  It had nothing to do with orders, neither from the Interahamwe provisional national committee nor from the party leadership.  That was not the case.  
Q.	In your own trial you testified that in 1993 -- and I believe you put it at some time during 
April to May 1993 -- that you had called for a congress of representatives of the MRND nationwide and the Interahamwe nationwide, which would be a means to implement the party resolution from your 
April 1992 MRND national congress.  That's so, isn't it?  Or perhaps you can tell us if that's what you recall.
A.	I do not remember saying such a thing.  What I remember saying is that I attended the 1993 congress at which I was elected member of the national committee of the party.  At the time I was the delegate representing the Gitarama préfecture.  That is what I said. 
Q.	Well, I'll direct us all to the document number 1 in my bundle, which is your trial transcript from the 8th of April 1999.  It's at pages 151 to 152 in the English text and 176 to 177 in the French text.  

But as I read these transcripts, it seems to me that you suggested that there be a congress for MRND representatives throughout the country and Interahamwe representatives throughout the country.  And that would be a means to implement the decision taken in April of 1992 for the Interahamwe to be spread nationally.  Now, do you recall making that suggestion back in 1993? 
A.	I would like to ask the Court for a copy of that transcript.  I do not recognise what is being said.  My explanation was that as a representative, an elected representative of Gitarama, I was convened to the Kigali congress in 1993.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, that is my copy of the transcript that I have just referred to.  I have highlighted it in yellow where it concerns the text that I've been discussing.  And I'd direct you to what's been highlighted.  

And in the English text, at the bottom of page 151, which would be at page 177 in the text that you have, Mr. Witness, it says, "Regardless of the party or the person in the region, there were Interahamwe MRND at local levels in 1994" -- and then you correct yourself -- "in 1993 in the months of April and May.  I think I was amongst the people who insisted that there be a congress convened of the representatives of all these people so that they cannot only set up a proper structure but also that they can adopt their method of work because this had been somewhat different from what we had been seeing in the beginning."  

Then you are asked, "Did you come to agreement?"  And then your answer, "Yes.  We were heard because even we received contributions from some members to set up the congress, but unfortunately there was movement, so much so that the president of the republic had to resign from his post as president of the party."  And then you go on with more explanation.  

So you claimed that this was an initiative that you were pushing, but ultimately it didn't bear fruit because of some degree of disorganisation in the party.  

So you have the text in front of you now, Mr. Witness.  But essentially what I'm trying to elicit from you is that there was a movement afoot by you and your committee to have the Interahamwe spread nationally, and you were going to do that through structures in the MRND party.  

Now, are you agreeing with what you said back in April 1999 or do you want to clarify that?  
A.	I think there's some confusion.  I am referring here to the national congress of the 
Interahamwe za MRND movement.  I am not referring to the national congress of the party.  

Secondly, this explanation here is to the effect that we had done everything to hold that congress, to make the congress come to pass.  But unfortunately we did not achieve this goal.  So there is no reference here to my presence at the congress, the national congress of the party.  

So if you read carefully, I am referring here to the congress of representatives of members of the Interahamwe za MRND.  We had called for such a congress, but unfortunately it didn't take place.  
Q.	Thank you.  And you anticipated that it was the MRND party or officials of the party at the regional level, at the secteur level, the communal level and the préfecture level beyond Kigali, that would take responsibility for developing the Interahamwe in their regions.  Isn't that what was anticipated? 
A.	Yes.  When we spoke of these things at that specific time of the action, we were thinking about conducting a census of the Interahamwe at the national level, then setting up a constituent congress.  And we did not need any structure in place in order to conduct the initial congress.  So what we were doing was attempting to get people into an existing nucleus that would then set up a structure that would cover the entire nation. 
Q.	And back in April of 1999 you also testified that the Interahamwe existed beyond Kigali, and you mentioned Ruhengeri in particular.  And if I read your testimony correctly, you seemed to be suggesting in the areas where the MRND party was strong was where the Interahamwe were created beyond Kigali.  Isn't that so? 
A.	The existence of the Interahamwe and the existence of management committees are two different points.  If we say that there were some members of the Interahamwe from Ruhengeri, that does not preclude or should -- when I say that there was no committee or no structure in Ruhengeri, that does not mean that there were no Interahamwe za MRND in Ruhengeri.  There were Interahamwe in Butare, but there was no structure in place in Butare or in Ruhengeri or elsewhere for them. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, if we look at my document number 5, or excerpt number 5, which is your testimony on the 21st of April 1999, at pages 46 to 48 in the French text -- 
A.	Can I have a copy of that document?  
Q.	Yes.  Let me hand it up to you.  One second.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Issa could kindly give this to the witness.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And you can direct your attention to page 47.  You are being asked by your own attorney about the spread of the Interahamwe.  And you mention -- well, the question is actually -- and I'm going to read the French, and this is at the top of page 46.  

"Did you know where and in which places the Interahamwe za MRND groups existed specifically?"  

And, Mr. Witness, you go on to talk about Kigali, you talk about Kanombe at the top of page 47.  You say that there weren't any in Kibuye because the party wasn't strong there, but somehow the administrative authorities managed things.  You said in Gisenyi there were some.  And then at the bottom of page 47 -- I will read the French text.  

"When in Ruhengeri préfecture, they were there because of the indirect influence, and you do remember that it was the same in Byumba.  But there were no people or structures, irrespective of how they existed, whether it be in those préfectures which I have mentioned, including Kibungo, which was an MRND-dominated préfecture."  

So you would agree, would you not, that by your testimony in April of 1999 you were suggesting to the Court then that there were Interahamwe in Ruhengeri.
A.	I did not say the contrary of that.  If you look at the '99 testimony, you will see that I said that the Interahamwe existed in Ruhengeri and so on and so forth.  But what I must say here, which is quite important, is that there was no hierarchical structure in each of those préfectures.  
What I am trying to do here is simply to outline the préfectures in which the MRND had more influence because we were able to meet the Interahamwe when we went there.  Nothing could be hidden.  When we had meetings, people came from Kibungo and told us that they were here to attend the ceremonies and they said they were Interahamwe from Kibungo.  

Now, one thing that we must bear in mind relating to this existence is that there was no structural link between the national committee and those cells of the Interahamwe that were dotted here and there.  And that is why, when preparing the Interahamwe za MRND congress, we wanted to bring those cells together in order to set up a proper structure.  So I am not contradicting you.  I am not saying that there were no Interahamwe in Ruhengeri or in Gisenyi or in Butare.  I did not say that.  
Q.	Well, thank you for clarifying that.  The only point at which we're not seeming to agree with each other fully is how the MRND party was implicated in all of this.  You are suggesting to the Court that there was no coordination between the Interahamwe in Ruhengeri and your national committee in Kigali.  And I'm not disagreeing with you.  What I'm suggesting to you is that the coordination came from the 
	MRND party, that it was the party structures that linked your committee in Kigali with the Interahamwe in Mukingo, for example.  You would agree with that, wouldn't you? 
A.	I'm sorry, Mr. Prosecutor.  With all due respect, what you are saying is incorrect.  It is absolutely incorrect.  I say so because it does not suffice to say that there was a connection between the national Interahamwe committee and those in Ruhengeri without providing me with a list of members from the Ruhengeri committee.  There was no such list.  There was none.  And so if there was a structured committee in Ruhengeri or elsewhere, I definitely would have been aware of it.  I would have been in contact with someone.  

Now, Mr. Filip Reyntjens, a Prosecution expert witness, came here -- thank you -- came here to testify in my case.  And whereas he was supposed to be an expert on the Interahamwe and having conducted much research, they asked him to say who was the leader of the Interahamwe at the préfectoral level and he was not able to provide an answer.  So I do not think that it is proper for the Prosecutor to tell the Trial Chamber that there were Interahamwe za MRND representatives at the préfectoral level.  

I received a document recently, allegedly coming from the Prosecutor, which indicated that there was a need to set up such a structure, that there was a need to set up such a structure in order to be able to move on and conduct a campaign at the national level.  

So my testimony to this Trial Chamber, which I repeat, is that we did not have any structures at the préfectoral level, although we may have had some cells or groups of Interahamwe here and there because of the influence of some political leaders in those areas.  The fact of the matter is that there was no structure in those areas, in those préfectures. 
Q.	Well, it stands to reason that if MRND party leaders who were out in the regions could coordinate the Interahamwe in those regions, that someone like Joseph Nzirorera, who had roots in Mukingo, would have had an interest in coordinating the Interahamwe in Mukingo.  Wouldn't you agree? 
A.	Hypothetically, yes.  Yes, hypothetically.  But I am not in a position to assert to this Court that there was a significant presence of the Interahamwe in Mukingo commune, as the Prosecutor would like to have us believe. 
Q.	Well, suppose we shifted our attention from Mukingo to Kibuye.  Was there a significant presence of Interahamwe za MRND in Kibuye in 1993, for example? 
A.	Almost non-existent. 
Q.	And you know that from having visited Kibuye?  What is the basis of your suggesting that it was almost non-existent?  
A.	It's an opinion that I hold, given that I know that Kibungo or Byumba were the strongholds of the MRND, and therefore I could assess the various areas in which the MRND was accepted.  And this was known.  It was common knowledge.  

You see, it would be difficult for you to make me believe that members of the MRND or members of the Interahamwe za MRND had influence in Butare, whereas you know how the PSD had literally cordoned off that area.  And the same applies for Gitarama.  So don't ask me whether I travelled to Gitarama to find out whether there were Interahamwe there or not.  I simply knew. 
Q.	Yes.  But, Mr. Witness, my question to you was directed to Kibuye, so I would like an answer from you concerning Kibuye.
A.	It was well known that the MDR was the dominant party in Kibuye, MDR and PL, those two.  Very few PSD, very few MRND.  
Q.	Well, wouldn't you agree that Robert Kajuga, the president of the Interahamwe, would be in a position to know if there was significant Interahamwe in Kibuye? 
A.	I do not know how he would have been able to make such an assertion. 
Q.	Well, let me put it to you this way, Mr. Witness:  Did you attend the MRND congress that was held in Kigali on the 7th of November 1993?  This was a special congress that was held in 
	Nyamirambo stadium in Kigali.
A.	There was no congress on that date in Kigali.  If you are talking about a meeting, yes, I attended a meeting in November 1993. 
Q.	That was the meeting where Ngirumpatse appeared wearing a long boubou, a flowing garb that was commented on, and there were speeches by Karemera and I believe Nzirorera as well and Ngirumpatse.  
A.	That is possible. 
Q.	And there was also a speech by Robert Kajuga as president of the Interahamwe.  Do you recall 
Robert Kajuga speaking on that date? 
A.	All I can say is that it is possible, because in most meetings party officials would be introduced and they would often say a word or two or make a speech. 
Q.	Well, I'd like to have us look at the text of Kajuga's speech.  We have a transcript which is already admitted in evidence as P. 12.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And if I could have Mr. Issa hand this up to the witness.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	This is my copy.  I have highlighted in yellow the portions of the text that should interest us.  I didn't get a chance to look at the page number at the bottom of that page.  Could you give it to us, Mr. Witness?  The first page there, what is the page in the French text?  

Mr. Witness.
A.	Page 17. 
Q.	All right.  And in the English text it's page 11.  And Kajuga is speaking.  He's already been introduced.  He greets the president of the party, and he's addressing the Interahamwe.  

And in the middle of page 11 he starts off by saying, "Dear supporters of the MRND.  You recently heard that the Interahamwe of the MRND were to celebrate the second anniversary of our birth on the 1st of November."  

He continues.  At the bottom of that same paragraph he says, "I would like to call upon those who claim that the Interahamwe are soldiers to come and attend the march-past, come and see how they were trained to be men of valour and how they have assisted the party to prosper.  They will make you proud."  

And then he goes on, on the following page in the third paragraph:  "I would now like to call upon our Interahamwe brothers from Kibuye to come closer.  They came to meet us, but their visit coincided with this rally.  Please come closer.  I know they spent the night here and we spent the vigil together.  Let all of them come here so that I can introduce them to you.  They represent the Interahamwe of Kibuye.  You notice that we, the Interahamwe, are not passive.  We are active."  

And then there is applause and the blowing of whistles.  And then he calls upon the Interahamwe leader from Kibuye, who takes the floor after him.  And that person, in response to Kajuga, says, "The national president of the Interahamwe, sir, thank you for having given us the floor.  Your Excellency, the national president of our movement, supporters of our movement, on behalf of the Interahamwe of Kibuye whom we are honoured to represent during this ceremony marking the second anniversary of the birth of the Interahamwe" -- and he continues.  
And then he says, "In Kibuye we have instituted the Interahamwe movement right throughout the cellules, the secteurs and the communes.  In each of those entities we have an Interahamwe committee."  And he continues.  

So having reviewed that transcript of the meeting that you yourself attended on the 
7th of November 1993, wouldn't you agree that this seems to indicate that as far west as Kibuye, on the other side of the country from Kigali, there were structures for the Interahamwe za MRND that were linked to the MRND party?  
A.	All I can say is that, first of all, I never said that there were no members of the MRND party in Kibuye.  I never said that there was no member of the MRND party.  

Secondly, the group of Interahamwe which was invited to the Kigali rally is not anything that should be surprising because they were free and -- entirely free to determine where they would seek sensitisation from.  

Now, when reference is made of the existence of committees at the préfectoral and communal or secteural levels, this must simply be just a manner of speech.  And, first of all, this took place in a rally, and during rallies people want to show off.  They want to indicate that they are important.  And although there were no MRND members in Kibuye who could have raised a finger because of the phenomenon kubohoza, which I referred to yesterday, all of this must be a manner of speaking.  

As far as I know, if the structure had been set up in Kibuye, they would have submitted a report to us to indicate that they were existing in Kibuye and that such a structure had been set up with such an individual serving as president in this commune and what have you.  But this has never happened.  

So the author or the speaker here is simply making a speech in which he is saying that they are present so that others may not claim that there were no Interahamwe za MRND in their area, whereas in reality there was nothing of the sort.  And I say so because I was not aware of any such structure in that area.  
Q.	Well, you don't recall seeing a group of people standing up and addressing Kajuga when he asked them to identify themselves and greet the rest of the assembly?  Because that also is in this transcript, and it should appear in the videotape, since this transcript is coming from the video.  But I think if you read through what I have given you, you will find a portion where Kibuye (sic) is saying, "Come and show yourselves and wave to the assembly."

You're not suggesting that those were stooges brought in simply to create the illusion of Interahamwe in Kibuye, are you?  
A.	Let me repeat what I have just said.  I never said that there was no member of the 
Interahamwe za MRND or of the MRND in Kibuye.  That is not my testimony.  What I am saying is that there was no structure in Kibuye that the CNPI was aware of.  

Now, whether people came from Kibuye as a group and identified themselves as a group and as such is in line with what I have just told you.  People could have come from Kibuye or from Cyangugu and introduced themselves as Interahamwe.  But there was no connection between those people.  There was no hierarchical link between us and those people.  And that is exactly what we wanted to do by convening the national congress of the Interahamwe za MRND so that these groups could come together, know themselves and set up a structure that would reflect the identity of the organisation.  So I have not said that there was nobody in those areas.  
Q.	Well, thank you for that, Mr. Witness, but my suggestion to you is that the Interahamwe in Kibuye were under the authority of the MRND party through its representatives in Kibuye.  So I'm not suggesting that they would have been in some sort of organigram that linked them to your national committee in Kigali.  All the links were between these Interahamwe groups regionally and the MRND party regionally.  That's true, isn't it?  
A.	Where we had those cells of the Interahamwe za MRND following the 1993 resolution, those who had set up those cells should have been in a position to coordinate them wherever they were located.  But I am not in a position to tell you whether it was the leader of the party at the local level who set up such a structure.  So I am happy that you acknowledged that we may be insinuating that there was a structure, because indeed there was no structure in place.  

Interahamwe in Kigali, for example, were within the party, and therefore one would think that Interahamwe groups set up in Kibuye and elsewhere would also be considered to be part of the party. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I see the time.  Perhaps we can conclude now and pick up after lunch. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

We'll take our luncheon adjournment now.  
(Court recessed from 1230H to 1405H) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if I could just bring one matter to your attention before we begin, and that is, to facilitate my flow of Defence witnesses who are available to give testimony, I have scheduled 
Colonel Bagosora's testimony for the 3rd of May.  

And I have sent some emails to his lawyer, Raphaël Constant, who is a friend of mine, and I don't mean to imply anything but he never has responded.  And I would like you to issue a written order so that Colonel Bagosora has a lawyer here on the 3rd of May, because he's indicated that he wishes to have one of his lawyers present when he gives testimony.  

And since I haven't had any assurances from the lawyers for Colonel Bagosora that they will in fact appear, I'm asking that you issue a written order directing that one of the lawyers for Colonel Bagosora be present in this court on the 3rd of May so that he can commence his testimony at that time.  
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, what jurisdiction do I exercise in making such a direction?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, you have powers under Rule 54 to order any party or their counsel to be present before you.  And Colonel Bagosora is a witness, and he has two counsel of record, and so I think under Rule 54 you can direct that they be present in the court to assist him in his testimony.  Otherwise I am afraid that we are going to get here and Colonel Bagosora will come on the 3rd and say -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I understand the problem.  It's a question of making certain that I have an effective power.  But I hear your submission.  

	And, Mr. Webster, do you have any thoughts on that?  
MR. WEBSTER:
No, I haven't given it much thought, quite frankly.  I didn't expect to hear an oral motion this morning.  

But perhaps one way of addressing the issue is just having the Court write to the Defence counsel, as opposed to making an order.  And since Mr. Robinson has already indicated that he's never met any resistance from Mr. Constant -- and I know Mr. Constant personally as well.  I think he's a very responsible attorney.  I'm sure it's just an oversight.  

But if a letter or an email was coming from the Chamber directly, that may get more attention, and that's probably a more diplomatic way and equally effective way of addressing the issue.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we will consider the appropriate response to your request.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you very much, Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Good afternoon to you, Mr. Rutaganda.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.  
Q.	I'd like to stick with Kibuye just a few more moments.  

Wouldn't you agree that Édouard Karemera, especially once he became the first vice-president of the MRND in 1993, would have had an interest to promote the Interahamwe in his home region as a responsible leader of the MRND party? 
A.	Hypothetically, yes, but I don't know whether he would have had the power to do so. 
Q.	What would it have taken, when you say you don't know if he had the power to do so? 
A.	It would have needed that he has a lot of power.  And, in fact, the political power in Kibuye -- he should have needed that, but he didn't have that political power leverage, as I said a few moments ago. 
Q.	You don't see him as someone with significant prestige and authority and influence in his home region, just given his long years of association with the previous MRND governments and President Habyarimana and local authorities in Kibuye? 
A.	I don't believe that his previous offices, as you mentioned, had a direct influence on the number of party members within the party in which he was, and that did not relate to the existence of the Interahamwe.  It is true that he was a politician of that region, an honourable and recognised gentleman, but he had opted for the MRND which did not -- or, for which he had to work to obtain members, just like all other parties that existed there in the Kibuye region. 
Q.	Well, in your testimony in your own trial back in April of 1999, in portions of the responses that we've already addressed in cross-examination earlier this morning, didn't you yourself suggest that the administrative authorities in Kibuye were sympathetic to the MRND?  Even though the préfecture itself may not have been an MRND préfecture, you in your response -- and I don't have the reference.  I can find it -- implied, if you didn't say explicitly, that the local authorities, administrative authorities in Kibuye, were sympathetic to the MRND.
A.	I do not recall having made any such statement.  And since there were bourgmestres, there were local authorities, some of whom were still MRND party members, whatever the case, if you want to provide where I made that statement, that would be useful.  Maybe you want to situate that statement within its context. 
Q.	Okay, I will look for it.  I will move on to something else, and when I find it I will bring it to your attention.  Would you agree that party leaders, MRND party leaders, were a source of guidance for the Interahamwe party youth? 
A.	I agree with you, and that is all that I have defended -- I have presented.  The Interahamwe za MRND belonged to a party, and we cannot disassociate ourselves from action that was not in line with the ideals of the party.  And so, by way of conclusion or by connection, they realised that they had to work in collaboration with the party and for the party. 
Q.	All right.  Mr. Rutaganda, I have found the reference.  It's in my document number 5, which is the excerpt from your previous trial testimony.  It's the transcript of the 21st of April 1999.  Bottom of 
	page 27 in the English text, which would probably be on page 46 of the French text.  But in English, as part of your response, you were talking about Butare and then Kanombe, Bugarama in Cyangugu.  

And then when you start to discuss Kibuye you say, and here I'm quoting, "In Kibuye, I don't know whether you would find such clandestine MRND members.  There were none.  But fortunately I would like to say that there are those who were led by the administrative authorities."  And then you go on.  

So my understanding of that portion of your testimony was that you were suggesting that even though the MRND party was not dominant in Kibuye, there were administrative authorities that were sympathetic to the MRND party.  So if you agree, you can say so.  If you think you meant something else, you can tell us.
A.	I cannot say in the first place that they did not have the MRND influence or Interahamwe there in Kibuye and come back to say that they were led by the administrative authorities.  I do recall the context in which I gave that statement or testimony.  And I was mentioning the fact that unfortunately -- and if you read carefully you would realise that I used the word "unfortunately" -- and contrarily, people were saying that the administrative authorities of Kibuye had -- were leading the 
Interahamwe za MRND.  That was a contra view.  

But this -- in spite of that, and I can give a concrete case, Niyitegeka was sentenced for having led the Interahamwe and not the za MRND.  It was the Interahamwe.  And that was in the massacres of Bisesero.  

Now, this confusion which was entertained around these massacres was what I was explaining, that even though there wasn't any Interahamwe za MRND group, which was a group which was not so important, he was being accused despite that.  And even the administration authorities, the bourgmestres, led the Interahamwes to go and kill Tutsis in the Bisesero zone.  And this is what I was saying, that it was not the administrative authorities per se that were sympathisers with the Interahamwe za MRND.   
Q.	So just to clarify a bit of your response, you are suggesting that Interahamwe perpetrated killings against Tutsi in Bisesero, but they were not led by members of the MRND or the 
Interahamwe za MRND.  They were led by persons like Niyitegeka.  Is that an accurate rephrasing of what you said?  Or clarify it if I'm wrong.
A.	I think we have fallen in the difficulty of distinguishing between Interahamwes and 
Interahamwe za MRND simply.  I can ask again the Prosecutor to tell me whether he is talking about Interahamwe simply or Interahamwe za MRND after the 6th.  In that way, if that is put clearly, my response will be very much easier. 
Q.	I was actually trying to get you to clarify, Mr. Witness, because the portion of your answer concerning massacres in Bisesero came from you.  That wasn't part of my question.  So if you would like to clarify anything in your response, you can do so, and then we will move on to something else.
A.	I was simply citing the judgement by saying that Niyitegeka or Ndindabahizi allegedly led the Interahamwe.  I wanted to explain that it was all lies in the use of the words attributing the responsibility of what happened in Rwanda to this organisation, that is, the Interahamwe za MRND, for those who are not very informed.  

Because the reality is that even the Prosecutor -- and if he is ready I can put forward the 
testimonies -- even the Tribunal was clear on this, that after the 6th of April the Interahamwe were no longer the version of the Interahamwe za MRND.  

And so, when you talk about Interahamwe, were they led to go from place to place and do evil, you need to be clear on that regarding the Interahamwe za MRND. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  We will move on.  Joseph Serugendo gave us an explanation of the Interahamwe za MRND that has a lot in common with the things that you were saying earlier today, Mr. Witness.  He claims that your national committee of Interahamwe za MRND did not control the Interahamwe outside of Kigali, and you agree with that; right? 
A.	I would add that even those in Kigali were not under our control. 
Q.	He also suggests that the Interahamwe was extended nationwide as a decentralised organisation.  Do you have any qualms about him characterising the leadership of the Interahamwe nationally as being decentralised? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Instead, he suggests -- and here I'm referring to document number 33 in the bundle, which is a sworn statement from Joseph Serugendo.  He says that instead, members of the préfectoral committees of the MRND party in each préfecture were charged with organising the youth in their locality.  

And I guess, following from your previous response, you would suggest that that was the same in Kigali; that if your organisation is not controlling them, it is the préfectoral committees of the 
MRND party that were organising the Interahamwe in their respective localities.  Do you agree with Serugendo on that point? 
A.	Well, I do not agree with the use of the word "control".  Now, to control means, you know, you are following all activities and there is no one who can act beyond your orders.  And that is why I'm saying that in Kigali you cannot talk about control.  

I explained the relationship which existed between the CNPI and the other committees found in the secteurs, particularly those secteurs in Kigali, and even less that which existed between these autonomous persons that are created left, right and centre across the country.  

And if, at a certain point, the person in charge of the party, following recommendations that transpired in 1992, decided to put in place or shift the Interahamwe movement, that was his business, and that is he had to carry out of the committee a person who is better.  Similarly, we ought to be realistic.  We cannot continue talking about the national structure from the moment that you are not presenting members of the regional committee.  We cannot -- we cannot continue addressing that argument.  

Sixteen years have gone by -- or 15 years and more.  The Prosecution has done his enquiries.  He's still doing them.  And he has at his disposal all the necessary documentation.  And I think that he should ask me -- he should give me the list of members, those who were present, as he talks.  

But just to pick in the air the example that he just gave from -- of Serugendo.  Now, Serugendo was the person -- was someone from the Prosecutors.  Now, for him to say what he said, the Prosecutor must have told him who were the presidents at the préfectoral level for us to have been (inaudible), and we cannot continue to speak out of the blue.  
Q.	Do you agree that Mathieu Ngirumpatse, as MRND secretary general, and Robert Kajuga, as president of the Interahamwe, expected MRND préfectoral presidents to establish and recruit Interahamwe nationwide? 
A.	I think we need to dissociate goodwill and reality.  Yes, it was put forward as congress had requested, that a movement or an organisation that was associated to the party be created to render Interahamwe official.  But that was never implemented.  And so on that basis you cannot say that 
Interahamwe za MRND was officially affiliated to the party.  I think that we need to dissociate just the wish or the will and the practice, the policy, exactly that which unfolded.
(Pages 33 to 45 by Claudette Ask)















1430H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Well, do you recall going over a videotape in your own trial?  

In your trial it was identified as Prosecution Exhibit 468.  And in this trial we have identified it as P. 256.  But in any case, it's a videotape of Ngirumpatse and Robert Kajuga addressing a MRND meeting at the Amahoro stadium.  Do you remember that portion of your own testimony in your own trial when you discussed that videotape at length with your own Defence attorney? 
A.	Yes.  Yes, I do recall that.  I accept. 
Q.	And you told the Court back then that you thought the videotape was from 1992, because it took place when Ngirumpatse was the MRND national secretary, and you placed it -- without knowing exactly -- sometime after June of 1992.  Do you remember that portion of your testimony? 
A.	Yes.  I think that's correct.  
Q.	Well, let me suggest to you that this is an MRND meeting that Mathieu Ngirumpatse had called for on the 28th of May 1992 when he addressed a rally at the Kimihurura roundabout.  And let me explain that I am asking you this question simply because I'm trying to establish when this rally at the
	Amahoro stadium took place.  We don't have a date for it in our trial, and I'd like you to help us to situate it in -- in time.  

So if we look at the text of what Ngirumpatse says on the 28th of May when you were present at the Kimihurura round -- roundabout, he calls for a meeting on the 8th of next month, which would be the
8th of June, at the Amahoro stadium.  And I'm suggesting to you that the videotape that you saw in your trial and that we have in this trial, which we've identified as P. 256, is probably that meeting that Ngirumpatse called for on the 8th of June.  Does that sound right to you?  Or can you think of other meetings at the Amahoro stadium of that nature that would have been confused with the one that I am trying to address with you? 
A.	I don't know why you would be confused on the issue.  Because when I was asked to put a date to the video, I said it should be in 1992.  Now you are also saying it is 1992.  I don't know exactly where the confusion lies.  And the meeting which took place at stade Amahoro was convened by
	Ngirumpatse, Mathieu.  And I don't see any confusion around that idea.  And in all honestly, I do not know -- I do not get -- I don't really grasp your question very well. 
Q.	Well, I apologise if I have formulated it poorly.  I'm simply trying to get you, as a witness, to inform this Court when that meeting took place, because we didn't have a witness to tell us the date of the meeting when it was admitted in evidence in our trial.  

But your own previous testimony and the answers you can give to my questions now would help us situate that particular meeting in time.  And I'm suggesting to you that it probably took place on the
8th of June 1992.  And if you would disagree with that proposition, you can explain to us why. 
A.	It is not that I don't remember.  As a matter of fact, for me to be able to date it in 1992, it is because I could see Ngirumpatse, Mathieu speaking as a secretary general.  He had become secretary general in April 1992.  So if he is talking in this capacity as secretary -- national secretary general, then it was in 1992.  So that is how I tried to date the rally.  But to state the specific date, I am unable to assist you in that regard. 
Q.	In any case, document number 14 in -- in my bundle is the transcript of the portion of the tape that we've looked at in this trial and that you looked at in your own trial.  And I can hand up to you the text.
MR. WEBSTER:  
If Mr. Issa would -- would assist, I will give it to him.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And if you go to the second sheet of that document, you'll see that it starts out with the transcript of what Mathieu Ngirumpatse said.  And he starts out by saying that, "I'm here, and I hope that the Interahamwe will take the floor."  

And then he goes on, and there is some animation, and then Robert Kajuga starts to talk.  And Kajuga says, "Dear militants, dear Interahamwe colleagues, among other things, I would like to ask that the national secretary support us in our recruitment of new members of the Interahamwe throughout the country.  But as he is so vigilant, he guessed what we wanted from him even before we asked him."  

This is my extemporaneous translation.  We have the text in French in -- in evidence.  And then I'll read what he says in French so that there is no inaccuracy. 

"It -- it became true that -- and it will always be so -- that the Interahamwe, who are the members of the party, should support it without any reservations.  In this regard, we would like to ask the préfectoral delegates who are present here to execute in the shortest possible time.  This programme is supported by the national secretary."

In the paragraph on the following page, Kajuga continues, "With regard to the recruitment of new Interahamwe, I would like to ask the president, our president here, to support us.  We also requested the national secretariat to support us so that our party should progress with the -- that he -- membership of new Interahamwe members all over the country."  

So now, considering what both Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Robert Kajuga are telling a national gathering of the MRND sometime in 1992, wouldn't you agree that it was anticipated that party leaders at the préfectoral level would recruit Interahamwe and organise them regionally?  
A.	What I have to say is simply that what is stated -- what they are saying here is not their own ideas.  What they are doing is repeating the resolutions of the congress, which had just been held in April.  I didn't say the contrary.  Indeed, the wish had been that we should, in the long term, attend the status of national structures.  But my -- what we don't -- where we disagree with the Prosecutor is that he seems to insinuate that based on this statement made by Kajuga, or the president, there was a
	national structure.  No.  We were struggling to set up the national structure.  That is the simple truth.  

I also told you that there was a planned congress of the Interahamwe za MRND, the main objective of which was to coordinate and ensure that the entire country was covered. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  We'll go on to something slightly different now.  

Now, in your earlier testimony you mentioned some sort of popular meeting of the Interahamwe that you -- you characterise it as an end-of-the-year meeting which was -- had a larger attendance than your typical meetings.  And this was something -- this was an event where President Habyarimana was present at the year's end, according to your earlier testimony.  

And what I'd suggest to you is that your description of that gathering sounds very much like a meeting that Désiré Murenzi describes in one of his statements.  But Murenzi puts this meeting at the very beginning of 1992 at the Hôtel Rebero l'Horizon.  And my question to you is are you sure that this meeting that you described took place at Technoserve, or is this the same meeting that Murenzi is describing at the Hôtel Rebero l'Horizon, which would be a year end sometime between the end of December 1991 and the beginning of January 1992? 
A.	We had contact for a meeting with the president of the party on two occasions.  And I told the Chamber that the first one was when we would explain -- and explain to him what our goals were.  And you also had a second one during which he informed us of his desire to contribute in the end-of-year festivity.  I never stated that we held a meeting with the president of the party in Technoserve. 
Q.	Well, where did that second meeting take place?  The one that you're telling us about.  
A.	It must have been in Rebero l'Horizon. 
Q.	So it would seem that the meeting that you described is the very one that I'm suggesting to you was described by Murenzi.  If that's the case, do you recall that both the president and his wife were present? 
A.	Yes.  It is likely it was the same meeting. 
Q.	And the president and his wife were both there? 
A.	I no longer recall having seen the president -- the wife of the president of the party at that meeting. 
Q.	According to Murenzi, both Joseph Nzirorera and his wife were also present.  Do you recall seeing them? 
A.	No, I don't recall either. 
Q.	What about Alphonse Ntilivamunda, I believe, who was the son-in-law of the president?  Do you recall seeing him? 
A.	No.  I have a feeling that it -- it seems that this was not the same meeting.  I -- I never attended a meeting in my capacity as member of the Interahamwe national committee in which these type of people were in attendance.  Because normally when we were summoned by the president of the party, we would go in a group comprised in our capacity as conseillers and members of the committee.  And most of the time the person I met was the president, who would be addressing us. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  We'll move on. 
MR. WEBSTER:  
If I could have the assistance of Mr. Issa.  If you could show this document to the Court and to the other side and then place it before the witness. 

There are actually four sheets to that paper, but I don't think it -- it's a big deal in terms of going over each one.  But just for the clarity of the record, it's a document comprised of four pages, which are
four photographs. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:  
Q.	Mr. Rutaganda, I would like you to leaf through those four pages and tell me if you recognise the person that -- in those photographs. 
A.	I don't recognise.  There seems to be somebody I recognise, but it -- the third one, is that Ngeze, I think?  I don't recognise them, unless you give me a clue.  If you give me a clue, then I should be in a position to confirm. 
Q.	The only clue that I can give you is that all four photographs are of the same person.  And the -- the 
	last two, he is wearing a head wrap which is similar to the head wraps that Hassan Ngeze often wears.  But that is not Hassan Ngeze.  So that's really all I can say.  If you don't recognise it, it's fine.  We will go on to something else.  
A.	I don't recognise him. 
Q.	Thank you.  

In any case, according to Désiré Murenzi, the person that you see in those photographs was someone that he would see at some of the early meetings of the Interahamwe, who, like him, resigned from the MRND party and left the Interahamwe organisation after it turned violent.  Sometime in mid 1992 they both left the party.  Having said that, do you recognise the person?  If you don't, it's not a problem.  We'll go on.  But supposedly this is someone who attended meetings that you also attended at the Rubangura, Védaste building. 
A.	Firstly, I told you I don't recognise him.  Whether he resigned or not, I never saw a resignation letter from anyone.  No one ever sent us a resignation letter.  So I can only insist on the fact that his attitude is a posterior reaction to the events with regard to Murenzi.  Why he resigned, and for what reason, I can't tell. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  

In any case, Murenzi claims to have resigned and distanced himself from the Interahamwe and from the MRND because he perceived it to be -- to be becoming a very violent organisation.  And what I'd suggest to you is that the same thing can be said about Jean-Pierre Turatsinze, who was a part of the Interahamwe organisation but seemed to have turned against it sometime in early 1994.  

Now, you've testified previously that Turatsinze was a driver.  Don't you recall that Turatsinze also worked in -- in an office at the MRND secretariat that was designated "youth services" or
"mobilisation of youth"? 
A.	You refer to -- rather, I would like you to break down your question because you have raised many issues at the same time.  I can give you partial answers if -- regarding, for example, Murenzi.  Murenzi did not resign because there was violence within the Interahamwe za MRND.  Rather, it was the results of frustration he had experienced because the people with whom we had all founded this had -- went back into the background and he was the only one who was remaining.

	As a matter of fact, we had had a feeling that we were not in our right -- right place because the movement was becoming the movement of the youth of continuous animation.  You had activities in connection with rallies that always required -- to be more realistic, Murenzi apparently claimed that he was threatened as a bomb had gone off at the entrance of his office.

	Instead of filling -- or stating that the Interahamwe had become violent -- yesterday I stated that there is no case where Interahamwe attacked people.  What happened is that opposition parties, having noted the multiplier effect of the Interahamwe za MRND and its member with respect to management, mobilisation and sensitisation of the party, sought ways and means to eliminate it and to nip it in the bud, so that in every meeting or rally they would place traps for us, and there were confrontations.  But with respect to it being violent, it is difficult for me to describe self-defence as violence because we did not attack anyone.  And I have examples that I can refer you to. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  Let -- 
A.	Please, if -- if you don't mind -- 
Q.	If you could direct your comments to Turatsinze's status with the MRND.  

So I -- my -- my question was ill formed.  I apologise.  Just tell us if you recall that Turatsinze was made responsible for the mobilisation of youth.  Didn't his office bear the insignia "youth services" at the MRND secretariat?  
A.	I never knew Turatsinze as somebody who was in charge of mobilising the youth.  Otherwise, we would have held meetings together.  Or otherwise you would have seen his name in letters which we signed.  But never did I see him taking part in any such action.  So much -- I mean even had he worked in an office bearing the sign "youth services", it doesn't mean that the activities within that office were a reflection of what was written on a sign on the door. 
Q.	Do you recall giving the following testimony on the 21st of April 1999 -- and this is at page 53 in the English text, page 77 in the French text.  And this is excerpt number 6 or document number 6 in my bundle.  

I believe you are being asked questions by your own counsel.  You are referring to Jean-Pierre, and the question to you is:  "Now, this individual who was named had another name and was working in this party.  What was his job in the party, Mr. Rutaganda?"  

And your answer was, "He had a small office on which it was said 'youth service/service de la jeunesse'.  And he was often there.  But he was someone who was known because sometimes he was a driver.  He would transport messages, distribute mail.  So that was actually his role."  

So didn't you identify Turatsinze as someone who was working in the office of youth service at the MRND secretariat when you testified back in April of 1999? 
A.	I never stated that he was in charge of the youth.  According to what you said, he was working in his office.  But the way I knew him, he was never in charge of the youth.  But, you know, you have to look things squarely.  I can't see how you can entrust the management of youth affairs to somebody who can barely write.  In my view, all I can tell the Trial Chamber is what I know.  And the manner is -- in which I knew him, he was there.  He was a driver.  He was a messenger.  And that is what I stated yesterday.  And that is why I insist on stating today.  Whether he worked in an office on which was written "youth services" or "mobilisation", it doesn't give him the capacity to be the person in charge of youth in the party.  I never knew Turatsinze in that capacity. 
Q.	Well, if it was not Turatsinze, who was in charge of youth services? 
A.	That's a question I was about to ask you.  But I apologise.  All the positions in the party were not filled.  But what I am saying is that the one who was in charge of youth services in the party is somebody I did not know. 
Q.	So now you are saying that there was an office for youth services.  It is just that Turatsinze, who occupied that office, was not the one in charge of youth services.  That's your testimony?  
A.	My statement is that I do not know Turatsinze in the capacity of the person in charge of the youth in the MRND party. 
Q.	In your book you claim that the -- the UNAMIR fax, Dallaire's fax of the 11th of January 1994, was a hoax.  And you basically suggest that somehow it was a fabrication.  But we have other evidence in this trial, documentary evidence, which I'd like you to comment on.  And here I'm referring to an intelligence report of the 20th of January 1994, which is in evidence in our case as P. 45, and which is also document number 20 in my bundle.  

And this is a document that was part of the testimony of Frank Claeys.  And he is describing a contact with Turatsinze that took place on the 20th of January 1994.  And he mentions a videotape that Turatsinze had given him of an MRND meeting that took place the week before.  

And according -- my recollection of the testimony of Frank Claeys is that when he viewed that videotape he saw images of Turatsinze walking around and looking like someone with some importance or someone who was supposed to be in the places that he was pictured at this MRND rally, which I assume is the one that took place in Nyamirambo on the 16th of January 1994.  

So here we have another document which is other than the fax of the 11th of January 1994.  And I'll hand it up to you.  It is in English.  

But now taking into account this document and what I've told you about the testimony of Frank Claeys, do you still maintain your evidence of yesterday that Turatsinze stopped working with the party in November of 1993?
A.	Could you point out the portion where he talks about Turatsinze to me, please.
(Pages 46 to 52 by Deirdre O'Mahony)



















1500H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	The whole document is about Turatsinze.  He doesn't identify him by name.  He identified him in his testimony, but he describes a meeting with a contact.  And he puts the context as -- you see, the 
	first line -- it says, "20 1900 Jan. '94".  And that's the 24th (sic) of January, and then 1900 is the hour, 
	7 o'clock, on the 20th of January.  And then it goes on.

I don't think you're going to find Turatsinze's name in the document, but you can simply respond to my question.  Here we have another document that mentions a contact with Turatsinze and testimony that I'm relating to you -- it's not in the document itself -- from a witness who claims that he viewed a tape, the tape that is being described in this memorandum, and Turatsinze was on it with a party walking around on the ground of Nyamirambo, apparently a person of responsibility as described by the witness.

And what I'm suggesting to you is that this undermines your contention that Turatsinze stopped working with the party in November of 1993.  So would you like to comment on that proposition?
A.	My comment is that, first of all, concerning this document, I do not know -- I don't know how to make a statement on the document.  That is to begin with.  Why?  Simply because I do not know the source.  I don't know whose -- who could contact.  

Or maybe I should just base myself on your statement.  It is not signed.  It has no date.  And I think that the person who handed it to the Prosecutor must have given the context of the documents.  But really I cannot make any statement on this document.

Now, continuing, concerning the issue of Turatsinze participating in any manifestation, Turatsinze was not sent away by the party.  He was not excluded from the party.  He stayed a member of the MRND, and he probably may have declared his belonging to Interahamwe za MRND.  

And so it's not surprising that he would be noticed at these meetings.  But I wish to assert that it is not in contradiction with what I said yesterday because it is common knowledge that Turatsinze was no longer at the headquarters of the MRND party from October/November 1993.  That is what I said, and I maintain my statement.  Thank you. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you for your response.

In any case, Turatsinze alleged that the Interahamwe were being trained militarily, and this is a statement that he's making sometime in January of 1994.  And what I'd suggest to you is that that doesn't sound very far-fetched in light of your own testimony yesterday.
Now, didn't you tell this Court that Ngirumpatse met with Interahamwe leaders in February of 1994, along with the minister of defence and the minister of interior, in order to distribute guns to them and -- sorry -- that Ngirumpatse met with Interahamwe leaders, along with the minister of defence and the minister of the interior, to arrange the distribution of guns?  
A.	Well, let's begin by talking about the practice or the training.  Yesterday I said that I was never aware of any such training being provided.  And I said so with good reason, simply because, first of all, if we had envisaged carrying out any training courses, the (inaudible) which must have unfolded -- followed.  First of all, sensitisation, recruitment of those who were supposed to go there and then their transportation and who was supposed to handle the training, who was supposed to treat them, and how they were going to feed.  And by the way, what -- what -- and where the (inaudible) would be based.

And so how can we reach them.  So all the logistics around this assertion shows that there was no training, there was no military training, by the Interahamwe za MRND because nobody would tell you who considers him or her to go to leave and who sensitised him or her.  But we need to have some proof of the vehicles that transported them.  

We should have some proof about the trainers who trained and educated them, and we should have had at least some proof somewhere of medical attention that they received while they were in those camps.  But none of this is provided, nothing apart from someone who comes here and tells us that they were training.

And this is a phony statement simply to accuse or to exculpate some people, some people who had been mounted against the MRND.  Whatever the case, if there had been any training of 
Interahamwe za MRND, I would have been the first person to know that.  I would be the first person to be involved myself in such an exercise, and I would be right here explaining to you, "We did this.  We did that.  We did this.  We did that," regarding training.

And I am very, very sorry, Mr. Prosecutor.  A few minutes ago you mentioned the veracity or the authenticity of the document from -- which the (inaudible) asked me.  As a matter of fact, in the pamphlet which I wrote, I said that the facts of the 11th of January of 1991 is fake.

And I maintain that position.  If the Prosecutor produces the original of the facts of the 11th of January, it would be the contrary of what I said.  But he will never be able to do so because even the 
secretary general -- the deputy secretary general of the United Nations asserted that he could not find the original of the facts in the archives of the United Nations.

That is very, very clear.  I don't know why the Prosecutor is -- well, let me continue.  Because -- because this document -- that fact is the document on whose basis the community believes that the Interahamwe were organised as a machine to kill.  I do not know why you do not want us to address the issue.

But what I need to let you know, unless you produce a document to the contrary, is that fact is a fake document.  You will never have it.  You will never have the original of what it states.  And when was it tendered in, the one that you claim?  When was it submitted into the archives of the United Nations?  

It was only after the creation of the Tribunal in 1995.  After the Tribunal was created, it was a way of finding proof to accuse those whom they wanted to saddle with the responsibility of that which happened in 1994.  Our colleague, Prosper -- 
Q.	We've heard enough about the facts.  Let's go back to my original question.  You told this Chamber yesterday that Mathieu Ngirumpatse met with Interahamwe leaders, including yourself, in 
	February of 1994 along with the minister of defence, Bizimana, and the minister of the interior, Munyaneza, to distribute guns to them, to the Interahamwe leaders; right?  Wasn't that your testimony yesterday? 
A.	That was not what I said.  I am sorry.  Mr. Ngirumpatse invited us into his office to inform us all for us to study together the strategy that we were supposed to adopt in the face of growing insecurity around leaders of political parties. 
Q.	Didn't you give a long recitation about Robert Kajuga and Jean-Pierre Turatsinze getting together and selling guns to FRODEBU, guns that they were being questioned about that were given to them by the MRND leadership?  

This is not something that I am coming up with.  This is something that you testified about yesterday.  You don't recall giving that testimony? 
A.	No.  I'm not saying that you are coming up with that, Mr. Prosecutor.  It was the consequence of the fact that you said that Mathieu invited us to distribute things.  That's not correct.  That's not what I said.  

It was the consequence of that meeting where we were informed that equipment was handed to us through Kajuga, Robert.  And that after, without repeating myself -- and what happened after I stated yesterday, we never had the opportunity of seeing with our own eyes this equipment which was weapons or firearms. 
Q.	Well, based on what you're saying right now and the testimony you gave yesterday, wouldn't you agree that the MRND president and the MRND minister of defence and the MRND minister of interior must have knowingly and willingly violated the Kigali Weapons Secure Area Regime imposed by UNAMIR by making guns available for distribution in February of 1994? 
A.	Well, I would not take that as a violation for the simple reason that there was information circulating in town that there was a lot of infiltration by the RPF among the population and that they were armed.  And so it was not a violation to set out to protect or to ensure security of party officials.

I myself -- I was armed, and I don't -- I think that -- even if I had taken precautions so as not to expose myself to these killers, I at least had a weapon.  It's my right to protect myself.  It's also the right and the duty of the state to protect these party leaders, particularly those who were targeted.  And so if they concluded that they were in a position where they were vulnerable and that the ministry of finance gave them a number of guns to protect them, I do not see any violation whatsoever of the 
weapons security area. 
Q.	Well, the guns that were going to be distributed must have been hidden somewhere to avoid being confiscated by UNAMIR.  Isn't that so if we're talking about the period January and February of 1994?
A.	That's what you are saying, but if you base yourself on the fact that I as second vice-president of the Interahamwe za MRND -- if you predicate yourself that Ruhumuliza, Phénéas, second vice-president of the CNPI, if you base yourself on the fact that Niyitegeka, Dieudonné -- if I only concern myself with just three, that all three -- we were not involved.  We did not notice the physical presence of these weapons.  You would understand that rather these were meant for -- to address the matter discussed by rumours that they were sold as personal belongings.

It's not because they were -- had been hidden to avoid UNAMIR to notice them during these searches but rather because they were used for another purpose.  That's all. 
Q.	Mr. Rutaganda, what I'm suggesting to you is quite simple.  And I'm basing the propositions I make to you from your own evidence, your own testimony before this Trial Chamber.  

Yes.  There were guns that were intended to be distributed to Interahamwe leaders as noted by both Mathieu Ngirumpatse; Bizimana, the minister of defence; Munyaneza, the minister of the interior, in early 1994 at a time when UNAMIR was tasked with confiscating weapons in Kigali.  All that is true, isn't it? 
A.	UNAMIR did not have the authority to confiscate weapons originally distributed.  Many times I went past, I was searched, I was checked by UNAMIR, and nobody touched my gun.  I had the permit to carry the gun.  And similarly to this, I had this from the ministry of defence.  It was known by the authorities.  But I do not know why you continue believing that that was irregular, carrying them.  But rather, the finality which is most important is that and, as you said, that these weapons were to be distributed to the heads of Interahamwe.

I did not say that.  I did not say that.  These were weapons which were meant to be used by the committee from that which had been pointed out to us so that we would be able to designate or find people who were likely to resist the assassinators, the perpetrators of the killings, particularly those who were targeting political leaders.  I did not say that this was meant for a general distribution or to the president of the Interahamwe za MRND.  
Q.	Your testimony, as I understand it, is that the guns were intended for you, you and your committee, and that you would then hand them off to others.  Isn't that what you're saying? 
A.	The weapons were meant to be used by the committee, national committee CNPI.  What should have been done with these weapons is something else because that did not happen.  I do not want to take a stance in hypothetical speculations. 
Q.	Spell it out for us.  Who is the national committee CNPI?  Give us -- tell us exactly who you are talking about.
A.	It was the provisional Interahamwe committee for the Interahamwe.  As I said yesterday, Kajuga, the first president; Munyaneza, Phénéas, who was the collaborator of the Prosecutor by the way; and yours truly, Georges Rutaganda.  And then we had the national secretary, Eugène Mbarushimana, and 
	thirdly -- or fifthly, Dieudonné, who was also your collaborator who is safe from any proceedings.  And so that was it.  When we're talking about the CNPI, that is the committee I'm referring to. 
Q.	And then you would then distribute -- the members of the CNPI would then distribute the guns to the persons you thought should have them.  Is that your evidence? 
A.	I told you -- I told you that this operation did not come to conclusion.  I said it, and I repeat it.  We did not basically see the equipment, the equipment which had been attributed to us.  And how could we have distributed equipment that we had never received. 
Q.	There is no "we".  It's possible that you did not receive it.  But as you know, there is testimony from other witnesses, other members of the international -- Interahamwe national committee, other Interahamwe leaders, who acknowledge having received guns from the same persons or persons acting on behalf of the same persons that you mentioned:  Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Augustine Bizimungu, Robert Kajuga, Jean-Pierre Turatsinze.  That's true, isn't it?
A.	I believe that, once again, you are in confusion about the distribution of weapons.  We were talking about the stock which was supposed to have been given to the Interahamwe.  Considering the stock of weapons, we did not receive that -- those weapons.  We did not see them.  And I said yesterday that information which was more true was that this equipment, these weapons, had been allegedly sold to the Burundian rebellion.

	Now, coming back to the assertions which you just shared that people received weapons from authorities, ministries, and all, I don't mean to say that.  And this happened after the 6th.  After the 6th, everybody could do whatever they wanted to get a weapon by using his various relationships.  And there were even soldiers coming back from the front line.  And if they had gotten (inaudible), they had obtained weapons from that side, they could come up and even at the gate and just ask, "Please can you give me a weapon," and he would receive a gun.

And the proliferation of weapons was so -- was so -- was so widespread that -- well, of course, these were the consequences of war.  Even grenades were distributed in this same manner.  If I had someone to whom I could talk easily, I would have gone there, and he would have found me a weapon, not necessarily from the stock of the ministry of defence or -- but, rather, he could organise himself and order one or ask someone who is at the front and battle front to obtain one.  And when he comes back, he gives it to you.  But we did not -- or I personally -- I did not receive a -- I did not receive any weapons for distribution. 
Q.	Wouldn't you agree that guns are not very helpful for self-defence unless someone knows how to use one? 
A.	Of course when you request for a weapon, you should also be able to use it, be in a position to use it.  But it is either -- to learn how to use it and also even to manipulate a weapon is not a very complicated exercise.  Maybe what is difficult is just the manner of using it, and all you need to do is to have it and be able to persuade your adversary.  

And you don't need particularly any training, and I said that I also personally asked authorisation to buy a weapon because I had been mugged.  I had been attacked.  I had been attacked.  And I was beaten and left half dead towards the end of August 1992.

But when people learned that this time I was armed, nobody was going to draw near me.  It was also a way of dissuading them.  Nobody was going to draw very close to me. 
Q.	But you'd agree that it would be reasonable to expect that persons who were going to receive guns also received training to use the guns; right? 
A.	Well, this depends on the type of training that you're talking about.  But I saw people learn how to use weapons there at the roadblocks.  And immediately after the person who had the weapon was also at the roadblock because the weapon was supposed to be at the roadblock.

And before he would stay behind the gun, and when he's going, he leaves it to the person who was supposed to relieve him.  It was a very simple thing.  It did not require any particular training from the way you're looking at it. 
Q.	You claim that both Turatsinze and Kajuga were disloyal or perceived as disloyal to the Interahamwe because they were of mixed parentage, each having one parent who was Hutu and the other was Tutsi.  Is that what you meant in your testimony yesterday?
A.	I do not know when exactly I made such a statement.  What I said was you cannot put words in our mouths that we wanted to exterminate Tutsis and then leave the authority to Tutsis.  That's what I said, be it Turatsinze or Kajuga, Robert.  I don't know how we could have used the Tutsis to carry out an operation that was meant to destroy Tutsis.  That is what I said. 
Q.	Well, the impression that I got, Mr. Witness -- and you can correct it -- is that you were suggesting that because Turatsinze had a Tutsi parent and because Kajuga had a Tutsi parent that they were perceived as disloyal to the -- or they were suspect among the Interahamwe.  If that's not true, you can just say, "That's not what I meant", and I will move on to another question.
A.	That's not true.  That's not true.  And if I said that there were any suspicions against Kajuga or Turatsinze because they were of Tutsi stock -- and by the way, I explained that it was not a concern at the time.  It was a posteriori, after the events, with hindsight, that all this information came through alleging that Turatsinze was Tutsi and -- because it was Twagiramungu, Faustin who said this to the Belgian senate.  I don't know that Turatsinze was Tutsi.  Initially, I did not know that. 
Q.	In any case, you suggested that both of them conspired to sell MRND guns to FRODEBU, which you've characterised as the Burundian rebellion.  You wouldn't characterise FRODEBU as a 
	pro-RPF organisation, would you?  
A.	An organisation?  Please.  I beg your pardon?  
Q.	You told us yesterday -- and you repeated it today -- that both Kajuga and Turatsinze worked together to sell MRND guns to FRODEBU.  And I'm suggesting to you that FRODEBU could not be considered pro-RPF.  FRODEBU was a Hutu extremist organisation from Burundi.  They would have been more aligned with the MRND than with the RPF.  Isn't that the case?
A.	I do not recall exactly.  Maybe you would want to verify your notes.  I do not recall having noted that Kajuga sold his weapons, property to FRODEBU.  I talked about the Burundian rebellion without necessarily pointing out which one. 
Q.	Well, which one?  Tell us which one now.
A.	Well, I cannot tell you exactly, but what is clear is that people were saying this.  There was a rebellion there, and FRODEBU is not -- is not a rebellion, as such.  The rebellion which the Burundi witnessed, to the best of my knowledge, was that which was led by the Hutu party, another one that was led by CND, if I am not mistaken.  But I do not know FRODEBU as a rebellion in Burundi. 
Q.	Weren't you aware of complaints about the Interahamwe receiving military training back in 1994?  Even back in 1994 and 1993, weren't you aware then that the Interahamwe were being accused and the MRND was accused of providing military training and guns to the Interahamwe? 
A.	All I can say is that these statements were a campaign carried out by the opposition to -- that were part of an attempt to eliminate their opponents who were the MRND.  And the campaign was part -- well, at the end of the day, it was a framing up.  It was a manipulation, malign -- a malicious story that was put up to weaken them from the political scene, not that it was real, it was true -- and even you, Mr. Prosecutor, for having carried out the investigation.  

This campaign was not targeting Interahamwes alone but all -- any authority or any person holding an office that would enable him or her to stand in the way of those who wanted power.  It was not because those in power in the opposition could have imagined that.  There were training sessions that -- we can necessarily conclude that there were indeed training sessions.  I learned about this in the same way as I learnt of Réseau zéro and Akazu and of other massacres, Amasasu, all of these.  We need to cross-check the authenticity or the veracity of this information.  Thank you.   
Q.	Well, don't you think that Augustin Ndindiliyimana, who was the chief of staff of the gendarmerie in 1994 -- wouldn't he be in a position to provide information -- or to provide accurate information about whether the Interahamwe were being trained back in 1994?  He wasn't a member of the opposition, was he?   
A.	You are talking about General Ndindiliyimana?  
Q.	Yes, I am.
A.	I do not know whether he would have made such a statement except you proved that to me.  Whatever the case, I know that there was an incident some time ago where the training of new recruits who were known as 15-day staff -- to go across a place known as Rwamagana and that the commander had sent a fax to the staff headquarters saying that he had seen civilians go for training at the bureau.  

And when later he was asked to verify that incident, that same commander or major explained that it was not the Interahamwe za MRND and that these were not civil servants but these were new recruits who sometimes would go in ordinary clothing, and they would not be transported before they get their military uniforms.  

I do not think that it is Ndindiliyimana who would come back after and make such a statement concerning the Interahamwe za MRND.  And if you permit -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
(Microphone not activated)...so we can finish with this issue. 

If Mr. Issa could assist me by handing this document up to the witness.  This is document number 19 in my bundle.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And on this very issue of a report being filed by a member of the gendarmerie in Rwamagana, I would like you to have a look at page 7 in the document I've just handed up to you.

This is a report made by Augustin Ndindiliyimana.  It's dated August of 1998.  This was before he was arrested by this Tribunal.  It's entitled, in French, "The Events of Rwanda of October 1990 to 
June 1994".  And he calls it an expert report, and he starts out with a foreword by saying that it's his attempt -- the document was his attempt to contribute to the search for truth in the Rwandan drama.

And then when you turn the page at the bottom, he talks about paramilitary formation of the 
MRND youth, at paragraph 4 at the bottom of page 7.  And he reminds the reader that he had given the same information to the Belgian senate.  
And he goes on -- and I will read it in French -- "As already pointed out in my testimony within the Belgian senate, the gendarmerie was the first to point out this type of training.  The commander of the group of Kibungo, through acts of 13th December, mentioned the passage of four to six lorries transporting youths of Interahamwe coming from a training in Mutara.  

"Later on the same commander reported stating that the persons transported were guards of 
national parks.  This problem was discussed within government.  The intelligence of the prime minister -- prime minister's office of Agathe, stated that these trainings had effectively taken place while the MRND was backing the contrary.  Among the Interahamwe you found young Tutsis and Hutus, and their president was Robert Kajuga, himself of Tutsi ethnicity."

So here we have General Ndindiliyimana going back to the same point of information that you just offered, Mr. Witness, which is a report by a gendarme about training that he observed or indicia of training that he observed which was then re-characterised as training of national park guards which was later investigated by the government and found out and determined to be true; that the allegation that the MRND was training youth was well founded.

Wouldn't you agree with me that Augustin Ndindiliyimana, at least from your perspective, would be a much more reliable source of information than the opposition parties that you have criticised who gave this same information?
A.	I don't agree with you.  And unless we're not reading the same document, Ndindiliyimana here is mentioning a commander of the Kibungo soldiers through a telegram, and I'm happy that it is through the information which I gave a few moments ago, that these four to six buses -- of lorries transporting youths that had been trained in Mutara -- this is information from a telegram of the commander of Kibungo, the person who sent this telegram to the gendarmerie headquarters.

What follows that, the sentence -- later on the same commander; that is, he carried out a check, certain reports asserting, not just mentioning, that the persons whom he had mentioned earlier on that he had thought were Interahamwe MRND were national park guards.  Is that not clear?   

We cannot put words into the mouth of General Ndindiliyimana that the Interahamwe were trained -- given military training on the basis of what he wrote here in 1998.  Secondly, that the -- Uwilingiyimana, Agathe testified that there was training.  That's only normal.  She is the one who wrote that rumour.  She was one of the bases of the origin of this rumour that -- at least her party that had put forward this information -- that had sent that information to the public.

And once again, I'm happy to note that the Prosecutor himself just told the Trial Chamber that our movement, the Interahamwe, was not only -- was not made only of -- only made of Hutus excluding Tutsis.  He recognised that there was a mixture of Tutsis and Hutus.  Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
Q.	In any case, Mr. Witness, we'll pick up tomorrow with this, but I'll direct your attention to the third paragraph, the last line in the third paragraph, where Ndindiliyimana says that, "The reaction of the MRND seemed to turn to discretely forming their own youth in Kigali-ville."  

And then if you go to the bottom of the page, he says, "The restart of hostilities on the 7th of April; that the Interahamwe militia commanded by Robert Kajuga received arms from the army headquarters."  So you can --
A.	I do not -- I cannot find -- I'm lost in the reading you are doing. 
Q.	Well, you can take this document with you this evening, and you can read it over in its entirety, and we'll pick up tomorrow morning.  What I would suggest to you is that Ndindiliyimana is clarifying, in this report at least, that there was training of Interahamwe, distribution of guns to Interahamwe, and that Robert Kajuga led the Interahamwe militias on the 7th of April and received guns from the 
	army high command in order to do that.

So we can discuss that tomorrow morning when we start up again. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We take our adjournment now.

Mr. Witness, I remind you, as I did yesterday afternoon, that during this or any adjournment while you are on the witness stand, you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  By the way, I'm alone, Mr. President.  I'm isolated.  I meet nobody.  Thank you.
