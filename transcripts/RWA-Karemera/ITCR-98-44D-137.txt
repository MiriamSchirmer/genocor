MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Madam Registrar, can you open the proceedings.  
MS. KOUO:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding; Judge Emile Francis Short; and Judge Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, the 10th of July 2006, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al., Case Number ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The appearances are the same?  
MR. NIMY MAYIDIKA NGIMBI:
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honour.  With pleasure, I am -- see that you are in good health, Mr. President.  

José Patrick Nimy Mayidika Ngimbi.  I stop there because my name is much longer than that.  In fact, my name is José Patrick Nimy Mayidika Ngimbi Maleba Mapukasundela Mambokobaka Mbakombo Natera (phonetic), but you will understand that, for practical reasons, I have always shortened this name.  So I am co-counsel, together with lead counsel, my friend, Peter Robinson, for Mr. Joseph Nzirorera.  We are assisted by our legal assistant, Leopold Nsengiyumva.  

And, Mr. President, I also have the pleasure to tell you of the presence of an intern in our team, Ms. Helen (sic) Brittan.  

Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Excuse me.  Could you remind me, what was the abbreviated version of the name? 
MR. NIMY MAYIDIKA NGIMBI:
Mr. President, the highly abbreviated version of my name is Nimy Mayidika Ngimbi.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Webster, is there anything that we can do today? 
MR. WEBSTER:
It's a very open question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  There's no -- it's not a question which is expressing any particular answer. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  Well, I -- I understand the Court's concern, which we share, that we move ahead with the trial.  The only witness that is available to us is our investigator, Upendra Baghel.  But moving forward with his testimony will be a bit problematic.  We've discussed this matter with the Defence several times, not just last week, but at the beginning of the trial.  And I foresee a great deal of objections and litigation over the issue of admissibility.  And given the time constraints that we're faced with, ending this session on Friday the 14th, quite honestly, in my estimation, it's not the best way to proceed, to start with Baghel when it's clear that we will not be able to finish his testimony.  

In order to move forward with him, we'd need concessions from the Defence.  It would -- clearly we'd have to be able to continue to talk with him, not only during his cross-examination, which probably would not even start, but even in the process of bringing exhibits before the Court.  We have not had the time to coordinate that sufficiently so that I would -- I would be able to take his testimony without speaking to him at the same time.  

So, quite frankly, I don't see that as a practical option.  But it is physically possible because Baghel is here and our exhibits are here.  But it does not make sense, in my estimation. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. -- Mr. Webster -- sorry.  We, our Chamber, don't see the value of compelling you to call this witness at this stage.  
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.  Beyond the matter of Baghel, I have spoken to at least one of the Defence teams, and there is a concern that we share about dealing with possible disclosure issues.  Rule 68 issues would constantly come up.  I -- I don't see that as a problem, but clearly it's been a problem for this Chamber in view of the -- the complaints and the objections that we've had.  So if we could address some of those issues now for the next session, that may be productive. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can I can ask you, would it be -- not be more appropriate for you to meet informally with our trial coordinator, you and the Defence team?
MR. WEBSTER:
Yeah.

MR. PRESIDENT:
If there are agreements that are reached, then we could formalise them into orders. 
MR. WEBSTER:
That's an appropriate -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would that be a more productive approach to this problem? 
MR. WEBSTER:
That's one option, yeah.  I assume that the Defence teams themselves will contribute to the decision that's taken.  I don't know if -- if they would prefer that the Court be present throughout the whole discussion.  That -- that's certainly one way to proceed.  So aside from the disclosure issues, the Rule 68 issues, Mr. Robinson expressed to me some concern about disclosures that were promised from the Prosecution in view of the recent decision on conditional disclosure.  Those are things that don't require the Court's participation, but there are administrative matters that we can address that should make the next session run more smoothly.  

There is the pending motion under Rule 92 bis that -- that the Court is still deciding.  To the extent that the parties can assist the Court in its deliberation, we are certainly available to do that.  Mr. Robinson had expressed some interest in providing the Court with additional submissions on the question of adjudicated facts.  To the extent that the Court would appreciate some discussion of that orally, we're amenable to that.  But I would think that there are, you know, a few issues that the parties could discuss among themselves and then come back to the Court for some sort of resolution, which would make our time this week productive.  

I believe when we concluded on Friday, the last item we discussed was an updated medical report concerning Joseph Serugendo.  I have not received any further information, but if the Court has, this would be an appropriate time to discuss that.  But perhaps I should conclude here and allow the Defence to raise their concerns so that we can have a -- a full discussion of the matter.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Anything from -- any contribution from the Defence side as to -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- how we proceed? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  Our first choice for how we would proceed this week would be to take testimony from Mr. Serugendo, and we fear that if we don't do that this week that we'll never have any testimony from him.  So I don't know if you've received a medical report, but if you haven't, we're running out of time to deal with this.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Unfortunately, we haven't received anything as yet. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Well, I would ask you to direct the registry to make that -- those efforts because if we don't hear something by the end of today or tomorrow, I don't see how we could ever take any testimony from this man.  And so -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we had, in fact, initiated a request.  What we would like to -- to do now is our trial coordinator will follow up on that and report back to us.  So we should have information as to what is possible during the course of today. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  From our point of view, we feel it's a good way to proceed, to meet with the Trial Chamber coordinator and try to work out other issues that are pending.  I don't think they need the attention of the Trial Chamber initially, and we -- I think it would be a good way to proceed.  

And it's also our view that the Trial Chamber's time would be very well spent in deliberating this week on pending motions and rendering decisions on issues that are important to the moving forward of the trial.  For example, the Prosecution has given us a list of witnesses for our next session, almost all of whom have Rwandan cases for which documents are the subject of pending motions that have not been produced by the Rwandan government.  And it's going to be a problem next session if we don't have those documents.  So it would be useful for the Trial Chamber to deliberate on the pending motion concerning that and see what steps it could take to solve that problem.  

Another example is that I've asked for subpoenas for two witnesses who have declined to meet with me.  And if those subpoenas were to be granted, I could meet those witnesses before the testimony of the witness from next session whose testimony is impacted by those people.  They have information about his allegations.  So those are motions that have been pending for a long time, and I think that it would be useful if the Trial Chamber used this week, rather than sitting in court, to decide those motions.  

I do have one oral motion that I would like to make this morning, and so I -- if you're ready to hear me, I could do that right now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you do, do any of the other Defence teams have anything to contribute as to how we should proceed? 

MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  This morning I'd like to remind you of a promise made to me by your Bench regarding the translation of the decision dated 16th June on judicial notice, the decision by the Appeals Chamber.  It seems to me, Mr. President, that you had almost -- and I weigh my words, since I know that this is not your direct responsibility -- you had almost as much as promised that the French translation of the document would be available by around the 
8th of August (sic).  So I opted to wait a few days later, today being the 10th, to find out whether we could hope to have the document made available to us during the course of the day.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just -- just as an update, our trial coordinator will enquire again, but the dates that she had been promised was between the 8th and the 14th of July.  So it should be sometime during the course of this week.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Very well, Mr. President.  I will look out for any more information from the Trial Chamber coordinator.  Perhaps the course of the day -- and by way of suggestion, Mr. President, for the rest of the session -- perhaps in order to effectively utilise the Court's time, you could try to settle all the accounts you have with us, that is, all pending motions and also, Mr. President, to try, as far as the Defence and Prosecution are concerned, to ensure that we do our best to ensure that the proceedings are not as chaotic as they have been.  And here I'm launching a bit of a challenge to the Prosecutor. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, on behalf of the Defence team of Mr. Ngirumpatse, I would like to support the suggestions made by Mr. Robinson and by Ms. Dior Diagne to point out that, in the course of this week's hearings, we are in the hands of the Chamber and, indirectly, in the hands of the Prosecutor.  I am certain that there is no need to hold hearings just for the sake of holding hearings, and I think the Chamber will make a wise decision, to which we will conform, of course.  

However, I would like to review two issues brought up by Mr. Robinson and my -- Ms. Diagne, which are on one hand the disclosure of exhibits and that of translations.  With regard to disclosure, at the end of each session we break on the assertion that everything will work out and that by the next session things will improve in terms of disclosure, disclosure which will have been conducted in good time, in conditions which will not oblige the Defence to catch up with the Prosecution.  And yet things get worse each session.  I think every session we have witnessed accidents that are so recurrent and so systematic that they cannot really be termed accidents.  And, at this rate, I do not know what the fifth or sixth session will look like.  We receive disclosure of exhibits a month after the witnesses have been heard.  That is not tolerable.  I think that the Prosecution should find solutions to ensure that we conduct our defence under fair trial conditions.  That disclosure should be a preliminary measure.  The 60-day limit should not be 60 days after the hearings.  
With regard to translations, I think that I would use this interim period to draw up a statistical table of the efforts carried out in terms of translation of documents from French to English as opposed to translation of documents from English to French.  Last week in the middle of the week -- or, rather, Thursday morning, the English translation of a decision regarding Witness ALG and Witness AWB, translation of a decision rendered on the 15th of March -- I felt sorry for my friend, Robinson, who had been deprived of understanding a document for over three months, a decision rendered by another Chamber.  But the same goes for our motions, our briefs, which are translated tardily.  I do not know if our humble contribution could be of any use, but I think we should draw up a record of the time of completion of translations.  

In closing, I'd just like to allude to a point on which I hope I can be heard by the Chamber, and I hope also that the Prosecutor will hear us.  Thursday afternoon something phenomenal happened.  The testimony -- because it was testimony and not refusal to give testimony -- the testimony of Witness AWB was extraordinary, and I would like the Prosecutor to learn a lesson from this.  The first lesson, he could solemnly withdraw paragraphs 31 and 32 from the indictment, which were merely based on the statement by AWB.  

Mr. Prosecutor, in the context of conducting a fair and honest Prosecution, you should remove paragraph 31 and 32 -- or, rather 31.2. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  At this time I would like to make a motion for an order terminating the transfer order that was issued by this Trial Chamber on the 15th of December 2005 for witness Omar Serushago.  I want to advise the Trial Chamber that I met with Mr. Serushago on Saturday at the UNDF, and he has declined to speak with me while he is under the control of the Prosecutor at the UNDF and told me that he would speak to me freely when he returned to Mali, the prison where he was serving his sentence.  

And he gave me a letter of the 5th of July of 2006, which I have with me.  It's in French, which he had sent to the president requesting his immediate return to Mali.  He is being held here pursuant to this Trial Chamber's decision on the Prosecution's motion to renew and extend the transfer order of detained Prosecution witness Omar Serushago issued on the  15th of December 2006 (sic).  In that decision the Trial Chamber ordered his -- him to remain in Arusha until completion of his testimony in the current trial.  The Prosecution has now represented that he will not be a witness in this trial, and, therefore, I think it would be appropriate for the Trial Chamber to issue an order terminating its transfer order of the 15th of December so Mr. Serushago can return to Mali and so I can obtain information that I believe would be useful in our trial.  

I have reason to believe that, like Witness AWB, Mr. Serushago will acknowledge that he has lied about Mr. Nzirorera's involvement in these events.  And I believe that also time would be of the essence because there's another witness from Mali who is testifying this week in the Military I case.  And perhaps Mr. Serushago could be returned to Mali with him if everyone was aware that he was no longer to be detained pursuant to this Trial Chamber's order.  

So I would ask that the Trial Chamber issue an order so that the impediment to Mr. Serushago's return to Mali and the impediment to my receiving information from him can be removed. 

Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, Your Honour.  With respect to Mr. Serushago, that is a matter that is still pending.  I had -- we had planned to address this matter.  We simply haven't gotten to it yet.  But I see no reason to oppose Mr. Robinson's motion.  He will not be called as a witness in this case.  We have not formally indicated that by a motion to vary the witness list, but that is forthcoming.  So we really take no position on this motion.  The -- the transfer order can be terminated as to where he will be sent.  That's a matter for the registry and the president -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, could the Prosecutor be requested to slow down somewhat for the interpretation.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
One portion of Mr. Robinson's application is that the witness be sent back to Mali.  That is a matter for the registry and the president, to resolve the question of where he will be sent.  But in terms of terminating the transfer order, that certainly can -- can be done forthwith.  And the Trial Chamber can direct the registry and the president to take appropriate measures to -- to send Mr. Serushago to a place of -- to a state where he will serve the rest of his sentence.  So, on that matter, there's no disagreement with the -- with the Defence application.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will need just a few minutes to formulate the order, and we will rise for a short time to achieve that.  I think that the -- our business in this trial session has been completed, and what we are thinking of doing is that, when we return to deliver the order, we will adjourn the session to the 23rd of October.  Of course, that will be subject to a request for a status conference, which may arise out of the informal discussions held by parties, or which may arise after we get information concerning the medical condition of -- about which we are going to enquire as well.  

So, subject to those two -- two matters, we are likely to -- to adjourn to the 23rd of October after we rise just to complete those brief enquiries.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Could I make another enquiry, Your Honour?  If it's possible, could we also be given the date that the -- the session would end and prospective dates for the following two sessions to the extent that it's -- it's possible?  I'm sure that's something that the Trial Chamber coordinator could communicate with us but if need be discussion --
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)...yeah, what -- as far as the next session is concerned, we -- I think those dates have been formally communicated.  I know we start on the 23rd of October, and we conclude at Christmas.  I don't remember the exact date, but it's the -- the usual -- I think it's a Friday, the Friday before Christmas.  
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.  Thank you.  
(Court recessed from 0945H to 1029H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are now ready to give our order on the application for the termination of the transfer order for witness Omar Serushago.  And this is the decision:  On 15th December 2005, this Chamber renewed, pursuant to Rule 15 bis of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, the temporary transfer of the Prosecution witness Omar Serushago, who was serving his sentence in Mali, to the UNDF in Arusha until the completion of his testimony in the current trial. 

Prosecution counsel has declared that he will not call this person as a witness in this case and does not oppose the vacation of that order.  For these reasons, the Chamber decides to vacate its prior order and requests the registrar to take all the necessary arrangements in accordance with this present decision.  

That's the order in this matter.  

On the other matter that we had indicated that we had taken -- make enquiries, it's been reported to us by the registry that there has been no improvement in the condition of Serugendo.  They are not currently in possession of a -- a document which reflects enquiries which were made this morning.  But that is the -- the -- the factual position.  There's no order that we can make with regard to his testimony at this time.  

We think we conclude the trial session now.  

Of course, we will be available to have a status conference if the informal discussions that we expect to be scheduled require any order to formalise agreements that have been reached.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'd like to make an enquiry, if I may.  Mr. Robinson had indicated earlier that he wanted to make submissions on the pending motion to -- in regard to the facts to be -- previously adjudicated facts to be judicially noticed.  And this is something that I would like to address this week in terms of preparing for that, if there's going to be some sort of submission, whether it's oral or written, and maybe I can enquire from him and from the Trial Chamber how we propose to proceed.  I wouldn't care to invest the resources on that project if it's not going to assist the Trial Chamber.  So if we could have some clarification on that point. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
As presently advised, we have not concluded that it is necessary or desirable to have further submissions.  We have not concluded our deliberations as yet, though.  

We wanted to express our appreciation to the registry and the various organs of the registry which have contributed to our work during this trial session.  Each time when we have expressed our thanks, we recognise that the atmosphere and the efficiency of our proceedings have resulted from many members of the staff, of the registry, the translation unit, the court reporters, security, who have invested a lot more than was absolutely necessary for their job.  And we really express our appreciation to everybody who has worked so hard and with such a good spirit to contribute to the effective work of our -- of our Trial Chamber.  So as we adjourn now, we would like to say thank you to everybody again.
