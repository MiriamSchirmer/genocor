MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, 3 March 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al., Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

The appearances are the same.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President, good morning, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your testimony will continue.  I remind you that you remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took at the beginning of your testimony.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Good morning, Your Honours, and good morning to the parties and the registry and everyone. 
ELIÉZER NIYITEGEKA,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And, good morning to you, Mr. Niyitegeka. 
A.	Good morning, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	Before we take up where we had left off, I want to clarify one or two issues from yesterday's evidence.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And to do that -- and to do that I'd like the assistance of the registry to hand this document up to the witness.  It's document number 6 in my bundle.  And it's a document written in French.  It's an intelligence report by a Belgian unit that was in Kigali.  It's dated the 11th of April 1994.  And what concerns me is paragraph 1, sub-B, the very last paragraph on the first page of the document.  And it's in French, but I'll summarise it in English, starting with that very last paragraph on the first page.  

And what this intelligence report is indicating on the 11th of April is as follows:  

"In Kigali, there has been a veritable bloodbath committed by Presidential Guards and Interahamwe militias.  The city is littered with thousands of cadavers, and we are beginning to fear an epidemic, since the public services and the Red Cross are so overwhelmed."  

"The entire country is affected by the troubles with the exception of Butare, Gikongoro and Gitarama.  The biggest massacres after Kigali have taken place in Gisenyi préfecture, the region of origin of the late President Habyarimana."
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Niyitegeka, I'm taking you back to some of your responses yesterday about not knowing that Tutsi were being targeted in the killings, and I'm asking you if you noticed any of what is described in this intelligence report of the 11th of April, on your way back and forth between Nyamirambo, which is where you were living, and the Diplomat Hotel in Kiyovu?  
A.	Let me make one clarification.  The Hôtel des Diplomates is not located in Kiyovu.  Secondly, I did not deny that there were killings.  I can also confirm that as I went to and fro, I saw dead bodies along the roads.  I reported to the council of ministers accordingly on what I had seen and the prevailing situation.  
However, let me be clear that it was not possible for me to know that a dead body belonged to one ethnic group or the other.  I could not know whether this dead body was a Hutu or a Tutsi.  

Furthermore, the document you have tabled before me, at least in its French version, does say that there was a veritable bloodbath in Kigali committed by the Presidential Guard and the Interahamwe militia.  I cannot deny that.  The city is strewn with thousands of dead bodies and there is fear of a possible epidemic; that is true.  And it is also true that the public services and the Red Cross were entirely overwhelmed.  That is true.  But this document does not state that the dead bodies were Tutsis.  
Q.	Well, thank you.  So it's clear from your response that basically you're agreeing with the contents of that sub-paragraph.  But we'll move on.  Thank you for your response.  

Now, taking you back to the 10th of April in Kigali at the Hôtel des Diplomates, were you aware of a meeting with members of the national committee of the Interahamwe on the morning of the 10th of April, with leaders of the MRND and members of the interim government?  There were several ministers that were not MRND members that allegedly met with several members of the national committee of the Interahamwe.  Do you recall anything like that? 
A.	Allow me first of all to state that I agree with what has been written in this report.  I do not agree with the entire report simply because I have not read it.  I simply agree with the excerpt of the report that we have read.  Not the entire report because I -- you did not -- and, in fact, I did not read the entire report.  I hope we're clear on that point.  

Now, Mr. Prosecutor, would you please kindly repeat your question, because I was somewhat concerned by this clarification that I needed to make.  
Q.	No.  Thank you for the clarification because that's exactly what I meant -- the portion of the report that we read in the record.  So we're agreed on that point, Mr. Niyitegeka.  

And my question to you now is, do you recall a meeting, hearing about it or observing it at the Hôtel des Diplomates on the morning of the 10th of April, which is before your press conference, where members of the national committee of the Interahamwe met with MRND leaders and several interim government ministers?  
A.	I do recall that yesterday I outlined to you my schedule of the 9th, 10th and 11th.  And I told you that in the morning of the 10th, I was at my home at around 9 a.m., and -- at the Hôtel des Diplomates.  Indeed I was there at that time for a cabinet meeting.  It was not for a meeting of political parties; it was for a council of ministers meeting, and that was my main concern.  

When I arrived, there were other issues that needed to be dealt with, including problems of the 
ministry of information, particularly, the fact that some staff members had made it -- or were able to get to the hotel, and they bombarded me with all manner of problems.  So I did not have time to find out or to follow-up what was happening on the other side of the hall -- that is, different from the hall in which the cabinet meeting was taking place.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  Yesterday, you also told us that the interim government met as a cabinet almost every day, at least every other day, giving us -- leaving us with the impression that there must have been at least 60 or 70 cabinet meetings.  You can correct me if I'm wrong, but what I'd like you to do is just glance at another document in my bundle.  This is document number 2.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Issa would hand it up to the witness.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	This document is a -- something that was prepared by Professor André Guichaoua based on his analysis of the diaries and notebooks of Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, Augustin Ngirabatware and Édouard Karemera, all contemporaneously generated.  

In other words, he took documents that we'd recovered in the Office of the Prosecutor, which were written as the events were transpiring -- similar to the notes that you took, that you showed us yesterday, from the 9th and the 10th of April.  And he compared them, one with the other, and was able to document -- based on those documents, those original documents -- 37 meetings of the cabinet between the inception of the interim government on the 9th of April and when it left Rwanda on the 14th.  

And if you see on this document, the numbers on this calendar that are in boldface and that are larger than the others indicates where he finds that there was a correspondence among these various agendas for specific meetings.  So would you agree that the information on this document is consistent with your recollection that at least 37 meetings on the dates that are indicated here have taken place?  

And before you respond, Mr. Niyitegeka, I'll -- I'll indicate to you that these aren't the only meetings, but these are the ones that are documented in writing because Pauline Nyiramasuhuko has also testified relying on her diary and also giving additional information about meetings that had not been recorded.  So now you can respond.  
A.	Well, indeed, I was going to say, just like you have said, that this information is sourced from 
two ministers -- that is, Augustin Ngirabatware and Pauline Nyiramasuhuko.  I take it that they jotted in their notebooks references to the meetings they attended, not all meetings.  

Therefore, I think that it would have been good to look at Jean Kambanda's diary, which you confiscated -- which you seized.  I do not believe that he jotted down all the meetings he attended, 
but I think that his diary would have been more relevant -- much more relevant than the diary of 
two ministers who attended one meeting or the other.  

So from what I can see, this somehow confirms what I have been saying.  So from the 9th to the 
17th of April, as you can see, the council of ministers met on a daily basis according to what was gleaned from those diaries.  So this is not at variance with my testimony, at least as far as the first week goes and in relation to the council of ministers meetings.  

Now, for the second week, two meetings; three in the third week; fourth week, two meetings and these, I believe, are only in relation to meetings that they attended themselves.  

Now, as for me, I have evidence to the effect that there are other meetings which have not been mentioned, which took place on dates that have not been bolded in this document, but on dates in which council of ministers meetings took place.  

I can talk about the 13th of May, for example.  If you look at Jean Kambanda's diary, you -- and -- and you are in possession of that document, I am certain about that, you would see from that document that there was a council of ministers meeting on the 13th of May.  I can also provide you with an invitation to a cabinet meeting of the 22nd of June, and yet that date is not highlighted in this document.  

So what I've been saying is that council of ministers meetings were held quite often.  Let us look at the week of the 4th to the 12th of July.  Yes, indeed, cabinet meetings held on a daily basis.  So anybody who reasonably analyses my testimony would come to the conclusion that my assessment is not 
far-fetched and it's not devoid of truth.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you for those clarifications.  We're agreed on one thing which is that at a minimum there were 37 meetings of the cabinet and you agree, apparently with Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, that there were more meetings because several had not been -- did not appear in the writings that Professor Guichaoua reviewed.  But we can move on.  Thank you.  

Now, in these various meetings, you, as a government, addressed many issues.  I suggest to you that you addressed ceasefire negotiations, humanitarian relief for those who were displaced by the war, the conditions of famine, foreign affairs of the government.  Am I right so far?  I have a longer list, but I just want to clarify with you that these are the types of things that you would discuss.  
A.	We discussed all problems, all the items that were appearing on the agenda of the cabinet meetings.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you for that.  This would also include appointments or replacements or -- and promotions and démissions -- or firings, both in the territorial administration and in the military.  
So here I'm referring to the appointment and removal of bourgmestres, sous-préfets, préfets and the -- and officers in the military; those things were discussed.  The procurement of arms, trade and finance, relationships and communications with your embassies abroad, in fact, all the things that a government does to administer a country, these were the topics of discussion on a regular basis when you were part of the government.  Right?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I told you the government discussed items on the agenda of each meeting.  
Q.	But what I'm suggesting to you is that some of the agenda items are the very issues that I've just mentioned to you, so if you disagree with me, you can clarify it, but these are the types of things that were discussed as a matter of routine by your interim government.  
A.	I -- I think you must be much clearer in putting your question.  You need to specify.  What meeting are you referring to?  On what date?  And what was the agenda of the said meeting?  Because I do not understand very, very well what you want to -- you want to know, in all honesty. 
Q.	I'm giving you a general proposition, Mr. Niyitegeka, and I'm not going to be any more detailed than that.  I just listed a number of things that clearly come up in the various meetings.  Not every meeting, but over the course of the three months and the 37 to 60 meetings that were held, these are the types of things that your government discussed and administered.  
A.	But, Mr. Prosecutor, I gave you the items which were discussed during the meetings on the 9th and the 10th of April, and that is specific.  That is precise.  I think you should be specific and tell me what did you discuss at the meet -- on this date or on that date.  That would be much better.  That would be much easier for me.  
Q.	There are several specific meetings that I'll discuss or I'll raise with you.  So we'll do it in the way that you suggested, but let's move on.  In -- in terms of decision-making in the government as a body, would you agree with me that decision-making was made on a basis of consensus?  In other words, you would discuss the issues on the agenda and you would adopt a resolution based on a unanimous vote. 
A.	That's correct.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  Now, taking you back to around the 12th of April when you left Kigali, by that time were you already aware of RTLM's virulent anti-Tutsi broadcasts? 
A.	I never usually listened to RTLM.  
Q.	Well, certainly as minister of information with ministerial responsibility for the media, wouldn't it have been prudent for you to listen to the radio or to get reports from others on your staff who did? 
A.	Well, you are right in approaching this issue in that manner, but that said, I think you should be much clearer.  Let me explain to you that I was appointed minister, as I said earlier on, on the 9th of April.  The cabinet meetings took place at Kimihurura.  Maybe I should spell Kimihurura in the interests of the report -- the recorders, the verbatim recorders.  K-E-R-I-H-U-R-U-R-A (sic).  

That was where the cabinet of the minister of information was located.  And from the moment I was appointed minister until I left into exile, I never set foot at my office because Kimihurura was the 
red zone.  It was the war area.  

I had staff -- the ministry had staff in charge of listening to the radios and submitting a report thereabouts to the minister of information because -- you must understand this -- the minister is a 
human being like everybody.  He cannot listen to all the radios in the world.  

And so the staff that was in charge of listening to the radios and submitting a report to the minister was led by a gentleman who came and testified in this trial -- in this Tribunal in the Media trial.  And I don't know whether you -- you permit me to give his name.  Well, he was in charge of giving the reports.  And he told you -- he told this Tribunal that he was not able to do the report because he could not get to the office.  And so as a matter of fact, in all honesty, I did not get the report from that radio.  And I don't get reports from radios.  But that was the situation; that was how things went.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you for your response.  It's very clear and very detailed, and I'll ask you once again to try to answer my questions much more concisely and just get straight to the point.  If I need more details, I'll ask you for them.  But do your best to just answer the question directly and concisely.  

So the bottom line is, based on your last response, you did not know the content of RTLM broadcasts prior to leaving Kigali on the 12th of April?  Is that your evidence?  Just give us a yes or a no, please.
A.	I told you that it was not my habit to listen to radio RTLM, and I believe you understand what I want to say by that.  
Q.	Thank you.  There must have come a point at which you realised that RTLM was making racist anti-Tutsi broadcasts.  When did you first become aware of RTLM making anti-Tutsi broadcasts that spiked the violence? 
A.	I received a cable sent to me by the minister of defence, a cable from the military staff headquarters of the Rwandan army on the 16th of April.  He was asking that the media, particularly the radios, to cease or to desist from including -- from broadcasting appeals for ethnic hatred.  

For Radio Rwanda, I cannot tell you.  I said that I used to talk with journalists and I had given that order to Radio Rwanda because that was the official radio -- it was an official organ.  It was the government media.  I had given that (inaudible) -- that order, and the director of the office for information in Rwanda was absent, but I took it upon myself to go out there to give that instruction to the staff of Radio Rwanda.  

As for RTLM, in all honesty, I was not aware of what they were doing.  I did not follow programmes over RTLM.  I'm -- but when I learnt it -- and particularly after that cable, I asked that the government -- and ordered the minister of defence to do a communiqué, a press release, about that, and the 
press release was done on behalf of the government.  That communiqué was broadcast on the 17th -- on the 17th of April.  And if you want, I can find that recording in one of your cassettes in your archives.  I can find it.  
Q.	Thank you for your response once again.  So your -- your answer is basically the 16th of April with respect to RTLM.  You weren't clear about the date that you gave instructions to Radio Rwanda.  
Just tell us the date that you instructed Radio Rwanda not to make racist broadcasts.  That should only take three words from you, Mr. Niyitegeka.  
A.	I held a meeting with the staff of Radio Rwanda on the 11th of April 1994.  It was on that date that I gave the order to Radio Rwanda staff to avoid and desist from any statements that were likely to incite the public to violence, whatever this violence may be.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
With the assistance of Mr. Issa, could you hand this document up to the witness, please.  This is the first document in the bundle.  It's not numbered; it was just the first on the top of the pile that I distributed.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	It's a document in three languages.  The initial pages are handwritten, a mixture of Kinyarwanda and French.  It's followed by a French translation, an official translation, and that is followed by an 
official English translation.  So you should have no difficulty in understanding me.  
Mr. Niyitegeka, I would advise you to look at the French translation because it's easier to read, but feel free to look at any part of the document.  These are notes of the same meeting that you attended on the 10th of April 1994.  These were notes made by Pauline Nyiramasuhuko.  They were entered into evidence in her trial.  It's D. 347 in the -- in the Butare trial.  

And as you look through it, you can tell me where she -- you may think she gets things wrong, but presumably you were sitting in the same meeting and making notations of the same things that were being said.  But she has information in her notes that you don't have in your notes.  So I'm going to go through it, and I'm going to ask you for your comments.  

In the first paragraph, she's talking about security.  And there's the sentence as follows, "The excesses resulting from the death of the president of the republic two or three days, that is normal." 

My question to you is, is she talking about the killings in the two or three days after the death of the president and describing it as normal?  And if she's -- if it is the killings that she's talking about, was that the consensus of those that had gathered, or do you think that that's simply her own thought? 

Do you see where I'm referring to, Mr. Niyitegeka? 

I will read it in French, "The excesses due to the death of the president of the republic two or three days after were normal." 

Mr. Niyitegeka, we're going to go through the entire document.  So if you could just answer the question as I ask it.  
A.	Well, Mr. Prosecutor, I do not know this document.  Give me at least some time to cross-check it -- its origin, its contents and the like.  
Q.	I asked you one question, and I read the sentence that concerns me.  So just tell me or tell us -- tell the Court, was that how things were discussed, or are these just the personal thoughts of the author?  It's a simple question.  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I took an oath here to tell the truth, and I cannot tell the truth on things that I do not know.  Just give me some time to know exactly what is written in this document, please.  
Q.	Have you finished reading? 
A.	No, not yet.  
Q.	Perhaps what we should do is this, I'm going to bring your attention to the portions of the document that concern me, and you can give us one detailed response.  All right?  Because I think you should've already read the two pages -- or actually it's three pages.  

I'm also concerned with the second paragraph where she talks about, "Soldiers cooperating with soldiers who are a symbol of force and politicians who have ideas.  Supervised roadblocks.  Soldiers should be kept with the population -- has made its own roadblocks." 

So I'd like to understand whether your cabinet is acknowledging that or seeing it as a problem.  

Then there's another paragraph further down where she says that, "The RPF stated that the government plans massacres", adding, "In that regard, it will take punitive measures against us."  And this is on the 10th of April.  

My question to you is, was this something that was being discussed, the fact that the RPF was already accusing your government of planning killings or was that just simply Pauline Nyiramasuhuko's private thoughts? 
A.	Well -- well, permit me to point out to you that as of now immediately, I realised that this document 
could -- could have been drawn from the diary of Nyiramasuhuko as you said.  But I don't think the translation is faithful because the first line of this document was not translated, and I'm asking myself why that was not done.  

The first line in Kinyarwanda, you can read it yourself.  It has no rendition in French in the document that you've given to me, which begins with "Umutekano" -- "security".  Does it appear anywhere in the French version -- in French?  I mean, just the first line where it is written, "Umutekano" -- that is, "Security is first item on the agenda."  

Was it translated into English?  I don't know, but in French I don't see the translation of that sentence, of that line.  
Q.	In French, it's highlighted, and perhaps you don't see through the highlighting, but it clearly states, 
"La sécurité" -- "security".  And underneath that it's (Microphones overlapping)... 
A.	No, nowhere.  
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)...it says that is the first mission.  
A.	Yes.  So it was scrubbed off then.  Okay.  Whatever the case, Pauline Nyiramasuhuko was not the government's spokesperson.  So I cannot consider it as a report of the cabinet meeting, and for that reason I cannot make any further comments.  
Q.	Going to the following page in the English translation, she talks about the responsables des cellules.  And she says that, "They should be reinstated to their duties and retrieve their honour so that they can help us once again in this hard period."  Was that a point of discussion during that cabinet meeting? 
A.	I just said that I do not have comments to make on notes written by Nyiramasuhuko who was not the government's spokesperson, and consequently I'm not committed by these notes that she wrote, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	In any case, further down the page she's taking notes, apparently of what Prime Minister Jean Kambanda is saying.  And he also mentions the issues of the responsables des cellules, and then Prime Minister Kambanda apparently says something about "RTLM contacted.  RTLM programme lowers the tone." 

So apparently there must have been some discussion at your cabinet meeting coming from Jean Kambanda about RTLM being a concern.  I would suggest to you that there's some concern about the content of RTLM's broadcasts.  

And on the following page, there's a notation for Ngirabatware where apparently he is saying, "RTLM will certainly cooperate with this government.  However, it must support the armed forces by playing songs that praise their bravery." 

And going further down, there's the notation "Eliézer" which I assume is you, 
Mr. Minister of Information.  And what she indicates which, I would assume, is your comment is that, "The discussion took place yesterday at RTLM.  So he has just said that Radio Rwanda must be called 'big sister' and try to act like RTLM." 

So my suggestion to you is that apparently there was some discussion of RTLM being a problem and you were defending RTLM and saying that Radio Rwanda should become more like RTLM.  Now, if I'm wrong in my characterisation, you can correct me.  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, the document which you submitted to me which, according to you, is Pauline Nyiramasuhuko's document, even though I have said that I -- I cannot make any comments on this, I must answer by saying that this document meets some of your concerns where on page 1 it is said that tribunals must function and carry out investigations on the tragedy.  And yesterday, you were saying that we did not want to carry out investigations on what happened in the country.  

Now, if you rely on this document which I -- as I have said, I -- I -- I restrain -- I -- I restrain from making any further comments, but at least you recognise or acknowledge that -- that -- at least.  

In truth, the courts were called upon to do their work and to penalise the tragedy that was going on.  
In this -- from this sentence, if you want to rely on this document, you would not say that the government did nothing to put a halt -- an end to the tragedy or to penalise the authors of this tragedy.  
I didn't -- are you accepting this time because you present to me a document which is yours and which contains this reality?  

From there, I'm going on to say that she noted Eliézer.  That is not a -- this is not a verbatim report.  These are not the minutes of the cabinet meeting.  And so if she wrote this, as far as I am concerned, I cannot answer to issues raised by notes taken by Nyiramasuhuko.  But -- by the way, I note that she noted that the courts were supposed to carry -- to carry out their work and they were supposed to carry out investigations.  
Q.	Well, let me come back to the issue with just one final question on that particular issue.  Did you discuss RTLM and did you recommend that Radio Rwanda should try to act like RTLM?  It's one simple question.  A yes or a no will do. 
A.	That is -- that -- that is not written anywhere.  I do not know exactly where you're drawing that conclusion from.  
Q.	Forget about the document for one second.  Just think back to the cabinet meeting of the 10th of April 1994.  During that meeting, did you discuss RTLM and did you recommend that 
Radio Rwanda should be more like RTLM? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, what did I tell you?  I said that I gave an instruction to Radio Rwanda.  And by the way, it was not Rwanda -- Radio Rwanda to act like RTLM.  We were asking RTLM to behave like -- to behave properly in the communiqué of 17th of April.  Not just RCLM (sic), but Radio -- Radio Rwanda and Radio Muhabura.  

RTLM, Radio Rwanda and Radio Muhabura, these are clear in the communiqué of the 17th of April.  The message is clear.  And you have that message.  If you do not have it, just give me some time.  Give me 30 minutes.  Give me 10 minutes, and I will find it for you.  
Q.	All right.  Your response is clear on the record.  I have one last question about -- in relation to these notes.  Was there any discussion during that meeting on the 10th of April about appointing ministers to be responsible for -- or to go to their préfectures of origin or the préfectures where they were assumed to have some influence in order to deliver the interim government's message?  
A.	In what meeting?  What meeting are you referring to? 
Q.	We're talking -- we're talking about the same meeting, the 10th of April 1994.  
A.	To the best of my knowledge, no, because I personally would have gone to my home in Kibuye, but I did not go there.  And the others even could not.  It was difficult to move.  How could we have been able to do that --  
Q.	Let me --
A.	-- considering the situation that was prevailing at the time.  
Q.	Let me direct you to the last page of Pauline Nyiramasuhuko's notes of that meeting.  And it's a list of the various ministers of your government, and next to each minister's name there's an indication of the préfecture that concerns them.  

So look at that list.  And I think it's easier to read in the French translation.  So for Bicamumpaka, it's Ruhengeri; for Ntamabyariro, it's Gitarama; for Ndindabahizi, it's Kibuye; for Ntagerura, its Cyangugu; for Eléizer, who is you I would suggest, Mr. Niyitegeka, it's Kibuye.  What do you make of that list based on your recollection of what was discussed back in the cabinet meeting of the 10th of April?  
A.	But this list was not discussed.  A list of government members was never discussed -- was never debated upon during the council meeting -- the cabinet meeting of the 10th.  If she took these -- down these names, it was simply maybe to -- to note the -- the -- the locations of origin of each of the ministers there present.  

Apart from that, concerning the message you're referring to, I myself carried this message to Butare on the 30th of April.  You have the cassette 945, and I am not from Butare.  I am not from Butare.  And yet that was where the government had assigned me to go and deliver this message.  
Q.	If not the meeting of the 10th of April, was not -- wasn't there a cabinet meeting where there was clear discussion of appointing each minister to go to his home préfecture -- or to a specific préfecture in which they had some influence in order to deliver the interim government's message -- message of security, however you define it?  Was it not -- wasn't that a policy decision that was taken at the cabinet level? 
A.	Yes.  Yes.  And I believe that it was during the meeting of the 27th of April -- the 27th of April, if I recollect properly, the 27th of April 1994.  It was during that meeting that the government drew up a list of ministers.  And in general terms, it was three minister -- three ministers per prefecture, so that each préfecture should have two or three ministers who would deliver the pacification meeting and also call on the people to stop the killings.  

I went to Butare with Minister Habineza, Jean de Dieu, who was a native of Gisenyi, and 
Minister Straton Nsabumukunzi from Butare.  

Now, for the purposes of transcription or stenotyping, Nsabumukunzi is spelt as follows, N-S-A-B-U-M-U-K-U-N-Z-I.  And Jean de Dieu Habineza, Habineza is spelt H-A-B-I-N-E-Z-A.  
Q.	So thank you for your response and your clarification.  And it would appear that the only disagreement we have is when that decision was taken.  You suggest it was on the 27th of April, and I was suggesting to you that it was taken as early as the 10th of April.  Now that the issue is clear, we can move on.  

Now, there was a meeting of the government with préfets on the 11th of April.  Did the préfet of Butare (microphones overlapping)...  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	-- and the préfet of Kibungo attend that meeting? 
A.	The préfet of Kibungo was present.  I believe that he was there and I think I'm not mistaken.  He was there.  
Q.	But the préfet of Butare was not there? 
A.	Not only the préfet of Butare, but the préfet of Cyangugu was also not present, if I remember properly.  In any event, to be sure, the opening speech at that meeting was delivered by Jean Kambanda on the 11th of April, and you have a copy of that speech.  In that speech, he mentioned clearly the names of the préfets who were present and those who were absent.  So I do believe that the préfet of Kibungo was present.  
Q.	You participated in the cabinet meeting of the 17th of April when those two préfets were removed from their duties, not so? 
A.	Yes, I was present.  
Q.	And the préfet of Butare was the only Tutsi préfet in the entire country.  We agree on that? 
A.	Yes, I think so.  I'm not sure, but I think so.  I did not know the ethnic identity of all préfets.  I did not bother to find out.  I did not give myself the trouble to find out about their ethnicity, but I knew him, and that's how I knew that he was Tutsi.  
Q.	And you also had no information by the 17th of April, when this decision was taken, that there were no killings in Butare as there had been in Kigali and Gisenyi and Cyangugu and Ruhengeri; right? 

In Butare and in Gitarama and Gikongoro, there was no information coming to you that widespread killings had begun by the 17th of April.  Isn't that so? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, the préfet is the officer in charge of each préfecture and reports to his hierarchy; namely, the minister of internal affairs.  Préfets do not report to the minister of information.  So what I knew is what I was told, and what I wasn't told I couldn't know.  
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, you described yourself as the government's spokesperson.  You were recognised as (microphones overlapping)...
A.	Yes.
Q.	-- spokesperson.  You've also told us that the ministers in cabinet all made reports to each other.  When I asked you or suggested to you that you should be able to articulate the government's policy more than any other, your response was that every minister was at the same level of information and could do the same.  

Why is it a problem now for you to acknowledge that you had no reports of killings taking place in Butare or Gikongoro or Gitarama up to the 17th of April? 
A.	Well, now, before I started my testimony, I took a solemn declaration.  Do you want me to lie?  What I'm telling you is that I was not in possession of those reports and indeed I did not have them.  So what I was told I noted.  If I wasn't told anything, I didn't know about it.  

Now what became available to us in cabinet meetings was the kind of information that I would then be in a position to convey to the public.  So as a government spokesperson, one doesn't necessarily know everything that transpires in all ministries.  And that is what I have been telling you.  I could not have been aware of all what was happening in all ministries.  The correspondences that were forwarded to all ministries were not necessarily copied to the minister of information.  

So we need -- really need to be honest about this.  This kind of thing doesn't happen in any government whatsoever.
Q.	Thank you for your response.  Your response is clear.  Tell us why the préfet of Butare was removed on the 17th April.  
A.	Préfets of any préfecture are state employees.  Isn't that the case?  And as state employees -- as state civil servants, they are expected to comply with the orders of their hierarchy, and the appointment or transfer of a préfet is a matter that lies with his hierarchy who would propose such a transfer or appointment.  

I am happy that in this case we have Mr. Édouard Karemera who was the minister of the interior.  He can tell you how préfets are appointed, who proposes them for appointment and who appoints them and why are they appointed.  So when it is said that this person should be appointed to this position as préfet, then that person is appointed.  If there is a request for transfer, that is how it happens.  So I -- I could not understand -- know why or object to why such a move was being made at any given time.  
Q.	Well, in your capacity as spokesperson and minister of information, how did you explain to the public the removal of the préfet of Butare and the removal of the préfet of Kibungo? 
A.	I issued a communiqué which is in your possession.  Look at that communiqué.  You have it, don't you?  You have the press release of the meeting of the 17th, in which these things are clearly explained.  
Q.	I'm asking you for your testimony.  What was the explanation -- what is your explanation for the removal of the préfet of Butare and the préfet of Kibungo? 
A.	I do not have any explanation to provide.  
Q.	My suggestion to you is that they were removed because they resisted the interim government programmes and policies of massacring the Tutsi.  The préfet of Butare was removed because he was preventing massacres from going forward in Butare.  And the préfet of Kibungo was removed because he was opposed to the killings in Kibungo, and both of them were killed sometime after their removal.  Isn't that so? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, your suggestion is erroneous for the following reasons:  One, it would appear that you are not aware of the date on which Ruzindana, préfet of Kibungo, died.  And I'm referring to 
Godefroy Ruzindana.  Ruzindana is spelt R-U-Z-I-N-A-N-A (sic).  Ruzindana.  From information available to me at the time on the 17th of April, Godefroy Ruzindana was already dead at that time -- that is, according to the information available to me at that time.  Now you say that for Butare, 
the préfet -- 
Q.	Now, you are telling us that Godefroy Ruzindana was not removed.  He was simply replaced because he was already dead on the 17th of April?  
A.	From the information available to me.  And that information was reliable.  
Q.	What I would suggest to you, Mr. Niyitegeka, was that you were not speaking on a regular basis to Mr. Mugenzi because that was -- I believe it's Mr. Mugenzi -- another minister in your cabinet that travelled to Kibungo on the 19th of April, if I'm not mistaken, and in the presence of Godefroy Ruzindana participated in a ceremony to install his replacement.  I may be wrong, but that's my recollection of the evidence of Mr. Mugenzi.  So you must have been misinformed if you thought he was dead on the 17th of April.  
A.	I believe that it is Mugenzi who was mistaken.  The information available to me was reliable.  
Q.	The information that we have is that Godefroy Ruzindana was removed as préfet by the decision of the cabinet on the 17th of April, a new préfet was installed on the 19th of April, and sometime thereafter Godefroy Ruzindana was killed by the Interahamwe. 
A.	I have already told you that by the 17th of April 1994, I was in possession of information to the effect that Godefroy Ruzindana was dead.  I knew Ruzindana.  We attended school together.  He was my friend.  So that is the information that I was given on the 17th of April.  

Now, when you say that there were no killings in Butare by the 17th of April, there again that is wrong information.  And you have documents which prove that in Gishamvu and Runyinya, killings had already taken place by the 13th, 14th and 15th of April, and that the issue was that the préfet did not have the courage to go and stop those killings because he feared for his safety.  He feared for his life.  He did not want to travel to these -- those locations because he feared for his own life.  He feared that he would be killed.  

So there were a number of places where killings were taking place and the préfet did not want to travel to those areas.  That, again, is the kind of information that was available to me.  

Now what is certain is that in Runyinya commune -- Runyinya is spelt R-U-N-Y-I-N-Y-A, Runyinya --
and Gishamvu, G-I-S-H-A-M-V-U, as well as Nyakizu, N-Y-A-K-I-Z-U, in those communes -- well, the killings had already begun on the 13th, 14th and 15th, according to information that was available to us.  And this information was coming not from any source, but from religious authorities.  
Q.	All right, Mr. Niyitegeka, we have your response.  We'll move on.  Were you present in Gitarama on the 18th of April? 
A.	Yes, I was there.  
Q.	At Murambi? 
A.	Yes, I was there.  
Q.	Did you participate in the meeting that was held between the interim government and the 
préfectoral authorities of Gitarama? 
A.	The meeting was not one with the interim government as such.  With your leave, I can provide an explanation to the context of that meeting -- with your leave, of course, because that meeting was not with the interim government.  
Q.	Perhaps with another question we'll have your response, but I want to establish some other things first.  Was Mathieu Ngirumpatse present in Gitarama on that date?  
A.	I do not remember.  I do not think so.  
Q.	What about Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	He wasn't there either because, as you have just said yourself, it was a meeting of the préfet and the bourgmestre of Gitarama.  And both of them were not from Gitarama, and there was no reason why they should have attended their meeting -- that meeting.  
Q.	I asked you a simple question.  All it requires is for you to tell us whether you remember them being there or not.  
A.	I do not remember.  And I did not follow that meeting.  I did not follow the entire meeting as such.  
Q.	Do you recall the presence of Édouard Karemera? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Justin Mugenzi? 
A.	Mugenzi was present.  
Q.	Pauline Nyiramasuhuko? 
A.	It is possible that she may have been present, but I do not remember.  But if you look in her diary, you will find out if she had been present.  She would have jotted it in her diary.  
Q.	André Ntagerura? 
A.	André Ntagerura?  Could he have -- I think he was on mission in Bujumbura, if I remember correctly.  
Q.	All right.  Why don't we do it this way, Mr. Niyitegeka:  Tell us the names of the interim government ministers or the leaders of the various political parties who you remember being present during that meeting on the 18th of April, aside from yourself and Mugenzi.  There are at least 25 other names that you can chose from, and all of these persons presumably were in Murambi, which was the headquarters of the interim government.  
A.	Can you give me the list of those 25 persons, please. 
Q.	No.  I would like you to reflect and use your memory and tell us who you recall being present.  Because when I say approximately 25 persons, I'm talking about the 19 ministers and the heads of each of the five political parties that participated in your government.  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I have already told you that I was in Gitarama, and I know that a meeting took place there.  I went into the meeting hall briefly, and I didn't attend the entire meeting.  You see, there were journalists of the international media who had come to fetch me, and so I was granting interviews to those journalists and did not attend the entire meeting.  What is certain is that Mugenzi was present, and I say so because I saw him.  And also certainly another point -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. Prosecutor, we missed out the name mentioned by the witness because there was an overlap.  
MR. WEBSTER:
The witness said Kambanda and Mugenzi.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Niyitegeka, you recall Mugenzi's presence and Mugenzi in his own trial acknowledged being present.  And you recall Kambanda because it was Kambanda who was speaking.  And other than those two who are obviously present, because they don't deny it, you can't remember anybody else.  
A.	No, I -- I think it -- I'm not wrong.  I'm -- I'm not mistaken, and I told you that I only entered the meeting hall briefly because I had to attend to some journalists and I was granting interviews.  That is what I was doing.  That was my duty.  

Mr. Prosecutor, that was my prime duty.  And I -- I -- I had nothing to discuss with the bourgmestres because I was not the minister of the interior, and the prime minister was present who was expected to convey the message.  So it was not really the government as such, it was the prime minister, he -- 
he -- who was having a -- a meeting with these people.  And I had no business with that meeting as such.  
Q.	Thank you for your response.  Your answer is clear.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I see the time.  We can take our break now.  And sorry to report that things are going much slower than I anticipated; it's clear that this witness will not -- I will not be finished before lunch.  But I will move as quickly as possible.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for the update.  

We take our mid-morning recess now.
(Court recessed at 1030H) 
(Pages 1 to 17 by Jean Baigent)










(Court resumed at 1130H)
 BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Niyitegeka, as a matter of policy, your government, the interim government, agreed to reinstate payment of cellule leaders.  Isn't that so?  Or can you tell us anything about that? 
A.	Yes, that's true. 
Q.	And this was a contentious issue under the government of Agathe Uwilingiyimana because the opposition parties were opposed to paying cellule leaders because they were mostly MRND members.  Isn't that the basis of the controversy of that issue? 
A.	Yes.  And when government took that decision, I presented the decision, and I went on to explain the motivation on the line government's decision to take that decision.   I gave the explanation. 
Q.	You gave the explanation in a radio interview; is isn't that so? 
A.	That's it. 
Q.	And this was on the 16th of April or thereabouts? 
A.	I cannot recall the date exactly.  But since you have the cassette, you certainly can help me to refresh my memory. 
Q.	Well, you may have discussed it on more than one occasion, because a number of 
interim government ministers and Mr. Karemera himself discussed it on a number of occasions.  I think the first occasion that I'm aware of it being discussed was on the 7th of November 1993 during an MRND congress.  And Pauline Nyiramasuhuko addresses the issue in the minutes that we reviewed earlier of the 10th of April.  And I do have a transcript of a radio interview of the 16th of April that you gave.  But perhaps you discussed it on more than one occasion.  So were there several occasions where you discussed the issue, or was it only that one radio interview? 
A.	To begin with, in April Karemera was not yet minister.  I don't know why you are associating him with decisions of the cabinet government concerning the payments and allowances for 
responsables de cellule.  

In addition, Pauline Nyiramasuhuko was not government spokesperson.  And so whatever she wrote does not commit government.  I am saying that I committed government in what I said.  But as for Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, ask her.  Ask any member of government.  Pauline -- all that she wrote is her business.  It concerns her.  It does not commit government.  It commits her alone.  

And I have said that in all that she has said in the report of 16th April, that commits her.  But in that report we decided about paying those allowances, and I explained and backed my statement over the radio, noting why government had decided to grant these allowances to responsable de cellules. 
Q.	Thank you for the clarification.  I was just providing you with some background because this is an issue that was discussed by Karemera on the 7th of November 1993, so it was before the interim government was put in place.  And I believe that he and other MRND leaders addressed it again on the 
16th of January 1994 during an MRND rally in Nyamirambo.  

But the decision to start paying again cellule leaders, leaders at the level of the cellule, was not taken until the interim government, the Abatabazi government, made that decision sometime in April.  And according to your interview, it must have been before the 16th of April because you talk about it on the 16th of April.
A.	Counsel, I told you that I was not part of the MRND party.  I did not attend the MRND meeting that took place in November 1993.  Neither did I attend that of 16th April 1994.  So please, do not associate me with those meetings.  

As for that which motivated government's decision on the 16th of April, I repeat, I substantiated that.  And would you be kind enough to give me a reading of what I said, because it is clear.  
Q.	Wouldn't you agree that paying leaders at the level of the cellule was a way of assuring their cooperation on the part of the government?  It was a way of rewarding them and getting them to do the government's bidding.  Wouldn't you agree? 
A.	Counsel -- well, Mr. Prosecutor, I repeat, now, what cooperation is it?  I stated this in the communiqué.  What type of cooperation do you expect from these people?  It is very clear in the communiqué.  It is very precise.  Just read the communiqué.  
MR. NIMY: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  

Can the -- would the Prosecutor accept that I help him by asking Mr. Issa to hand him the -- D. NZ495 in which you have the press release of the witness concerning this specific issue, so that they do not continue having exchanges and misunderstandings.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you for your assistance, Mr. Nimy.  I certainly  will take your suggestion.  Maybe Mr. Issa could hand me that exhibit.  I don't have it with me.  I have something else.  But I will proceed with my questioning.  But in the meantime, if I could be handed the exhibit, the authority in evidence, that would assist.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Do you agree that the contentious issue about paying cellule leaders was that they were mostly 
MRND party members? 
A.	That, as well, I explained in my press release.  I explained it.  Just wait for us to have the communiqué, and then I will read it to you. 
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, the communiqué is one thing and your testimony is another.  I am asking for your testimony.  We will get to the writing in a few moments.  

Wouldn't you agree that this was a contentious issue before your government was put in place precisely because the majority, the overwhelming majority, of cellule leaders had been appointed under the MRND party state and were MRND party members? 
A.	The majority -- well, I do not know.  But that which I know is that all cellule responsables were not members of MRND.  There were others who were members of other parties:  MDR, PSD, PL and PDC.  You had other responsable de cellule of those parties. 
Q.	Yes, but even in préfectures where the préfets were members of the opposition parties, most of the cellule leaders were MRND party members; isn't that so? 
A.	But, Mr. Prosecutor, you are engaging in speculation.  There was no inventory that was done.  You cannot give me the figure.  Nobody can give you the figure of the members of cellules who belonged to MRND and the number who were members of other political parties.  That figure, to the best of my knowledge at least at that time, I never heard it.  Those statistics exist nowhere. 
Q.	All right.  And I'm not arguing with you.  I'm just asking for your responses and you've given it.  

So I'll turn to document number 12 in my bundle.  I only have it in English.  And it's a transcription of what you said on Radio Rwanda on the 16th of April 1994.  And I will read slowly from page 3 as it's written on the document itself.  It's actually the second sheet of document 12 in my bundle.  But it says page 3 at top.  It's K number ending 8361.  

I'll hand you up what I'm reading, Mr. Niyitegeka.  Perhaps you can follow it in English, starting from the words "For example," which is the fourth line down in the second big paragraph.  

"For example, the government took one decision that I think that I transmitted to the Rwandan residents.  It was about discussions that they had carried in the former government, the government that ours replaced.  Those discussions concerned the reward of officials.  The government solved those discussions and decided that we should give this reward to the cellule leaders.  We must appeal to the cellule leaders during difficult times and say that we must reward them once we see that they have finished their duty.  

"The cellule leaders got up and ensured the security, appealed people to conduct patrols to fight against and denounce the enemy to the authorities and to the army in order to enable his or her prosecution.  

"We still need the cellule leaders, and there was no time that we have never needed them."  

And then it goes on.  And you explain a bit about the cellule leaders and the MRND single party.  I will continue reading just for the completeness of your understanding, Mr. Niyitegeka.  
"Only some of those in that government had their own point of view about that.  They had their own reasons.  It is true that the cellule leaders were elected at the time of the single-party MRND.  Then the cellules were said to belong to the MRND party, and they were some of the members of the 
MRND institutions.  

"Still, when the law instituting the multipartyism was set up and the parties were born, until the time that the government was composed of five parties, it is then in the same context that the cellules level is not any more constituted of people from one party."  

"Why all of us were in that single-party MRND and have now left it and joined other parties?  Why do you think that cellule leaders cannot join other parties?  Why continue to say that they are 
MRND's members while they have joined other parties?  To say that they appointed them during MRND time is not a reason.  It is not a reason that would prevent us from rewarding the cellule leaders for what they have done.  

"That is why this government accepted that what the cellule leaders is to be paid until now is the debt, and it must pay them.  It asks them to continue to do their best to ensure security, to try to implement the government's decisions, to do their best to help the population to drive off the enemy, and for sure they will receive their reward."  

So I have read the whole passage now.  And what I am suggesting to you is that paying the cellule leaders was the interim government's way of ensuring the cooperation of cellule leaders in its programme of pacification and restoring security.  Wouldn't you agree? 
A.	Are you saying -- are you speaking the truth?
Q.	Are you asking the question or making a statement, Mr. Niyitegeka?  It wasn't clear to me on the record.
A.	No.  I said you are right.  You are right.  The text is clear.  You're just saying exactly what I said.  That cooperation, the aim of that cooperation, what was it?  It was to ensure security for the population. 
Q.	As defined by the Abatabazi government.
A.	Counsel, Mr. Prosecutor, I think we should agree on this.  Yesterday we talked about Abatabazi, and the translation was that it was the government at the time.  The word Abatabazi comes from the word gutabara.  It does not mean "to save."  It means to lend assistance to a person in danger.  And so the government of Abatabazi was not to save, as was translated.  It was -- the government, rather, was coming to support, to help the country that was in danger.  

So when a house is on fire, the firefighters, when they cannot find all the equipment to put down the fire, they can appeal to the neighbours to help.  
We are not seeking help from any other neighbours than the responsable de cellule, who are already very close to the people.  And we are asking them to help us to ensure security of the people within their various respective cellules.  

At least you accept, you realise here, that we launched an appeal for peace, for halting the violence and for security.  And we got the responsable de cellule to help us, people who sometimes did not want to contribute because they had no incentive to do so.  So we told them we were going to give them a reward, an allowance, and I think that that is only fair.  
Q.	Was it effective?  In other words, was paying an allowance to the cellule leaders effective in terms of buying their allegiance to the Abatabazi government programmes?  
A.	First of all, let me tell you, these allowances were not paid because we were overtaken by events.  The allowances were never paid.  Unfortunately, the money was there, but we were overtaken by circumstances, and we couldn't. 
Q.	But did your promise to pay it, publicly uttered on the radio, influence the cellule leaders to follow your government's programme? 
A.	I did not get your question, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	What I'm saying to you is I don't have a basis to dispute your testimony that it was never paid.  But my follow-up question is:  Did your promise to pay it, as uttered on the radio, actually have an impact?  Did you get the impression that the cellule leaders were now implementing the government's programme because of your promise to pay them? 
A.	It was the duty of the minister of interior to carry out an evaluation of the fulfillment of that promise.  And the minister of interior, if he did that evaluation, he certainly gave a report to the prime minister, because ministers' reports to the prime minister are not to the minister of information.  

And so I cannot say that that evaluation was not done, because it was not to me that he was supposed to report following that evaluation.  He was supposed to do so to the prime minister.  And that is why I'm not in a position to give you an exact response. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  Can you explain the civil defence policy to us, please.
A.	The civil defence policy is very well explained in a document dated 25th of May 1994, and I think you have the document in your keeping.  You can look at the aim in paragraph 4 of that document. 
Q.	Yes.  But I'd like your testimony.  Tell us about the civil defence programme, how it was implemented and what it was supposed to accomplish.  
A.	Well, the civil defence programme per se was not -- well, I don't know exactly how to explain this to you, but it was not as effective as expected.  The -- this document was launched on the 25th of May, and its implementation, to my mind, was not effective.  It was not as expected because we were overtaken by events.  We could not do all that we intended to do, all that we desired to, in fact, accomplish. 
Q.	Well, wasn't it a programme whereby retired army officers were called back to active duty and were given the responsibility of training and mobilising youth, civilians to fight the enemy, as you defined it? 
A.	About that.  Approximately that. 
Q.	And there were civil defence leaders for each of the préfectures, wasn't that so, appointed, retired army officers? 
A.	But the appointment of the responsable de cellule or the defence -- civil defence programmes, that was not under my jurisdiction.  I cannot tell you who was appointed where. 
Q.	Well, what did you do as minister of interior -- minister of information?  Because every time I ask you a substantive question about your government's policy, you explain that it wasn't within your competence, yet you were the spokesman for the government.
A.	Well, but that -- the competence of the minister of information are very clear.  These are clearly stipulated in the government organogram, and you have that document.  
Q.	Weren't you supposed to explain the government policy to the public through the radio?  
A.	But I did that, didn't I?  And you have the communiqué, don't you?  
Q.	Well, I'm asking you questions about the government policy, and I would expect you to be able to explain it.
A.	In all the communiqués which I did, you will never find anywhere any time that I gave the list of those in charge of civil defence of the préfecture.  You will not find that in any of the communiqués.  And you have the documents, you have the cassettes.  I am telling you, you will never find any because, to the best of my knowledge, there is nowhere that I gave that list, because that was not in my competence.  

That was under the purview of a clear ministry -- I think it's the ministry of defence.  And if the ministry of defence did not give that communiqué to me, I did not publish it.  If someone else had broadcast that communiqué, it was the ministry of defence that is supposed to answer regarding that communiqué.  It's not me, Mr. Prosecutor.  Each minister worked independently of the others. 
Q.	But based on your own personal knowledge, wouldn't you agree that Aloys Simba was appointed to head the civil defence in Butare and Gikongoro?  Right?  
A.	Well, that is what you say, and you are right when you refer to my personal knowledge.  Yes, maybe, but not in my capacity as minister of information.  
Q.	Ukilikiyeyezu was appointed in Gitarama? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Ntibitura was appointed in Ruhengeri?
A.	I do not know.  I do not know who was appointed in Ruhengeri. 
Q.	Renzaho was appointed in Kigali-ville.  
A.	Which Renzaho?  He was already préfet of Kigali-ville, and he could not have been préfet and in charge of civil defence at the same time.  At least that would have been my understanding.  So I think you need to ask one Gasake.  Gasake was the one in charge of those appointments.  He was the one who was in charge of those appointments. 
Q.	And the conseiller and responsable de cellule had a role to play in recruiting youth for the civil defence; isn't that so? 
A.	Naturally. 
Q.	And the ministry of defence provided munitions and weapons to be given to the recruits once they were trained; isn't that so? 
A.	That is what was provided for in the document on the civil defence.  But I do not believe that this is what ultimately happened.  And as I testified earlier, we were overtaken by events.  The question one can ask is whether the training actually took place.  So it has been my testimony that this did not happen the way we had expected it to.  

Now, to state that anybody was trained would be -- would not be exact. 
Q.	Didn't the political parties also have a role in recruiting youth for the civil defence, particularly the MRND? 
A.	For the MRND I do not know.  I was a matter of the -- a member of the MDR, chairman in my area, and I did not play any role in the recruitment of those youth for the civil defence. 
Q.	Don't you know on the basis of your own personal experience and what you could observe that the MRND's -- excuse me, the Interahamwe's MRND were incorporated in the civil defence?  Isn't that so? 
A.	Do you want me to describe the Interahamwe again, as I did the day before yesterday, how the organisation was actually infiltrated and how it is that anybody could claim to be Interahamwe simply by buying the Interahamwe attire which was being sold by one Ndamage?  
Q.	You gave us that explanation already.  Let me put the question to you another way.  Didn't the 
political parties, particularly the MRND, work hand in hand with local authorities to recruit youth for the civil defence? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I was minister of information, but it was not possible for me to closely monitor everything that the MRND was doing across the country.  If they did so, I think they are the ones to answer and not I. 
Q.	Explain the policy of pacification to us.  How is pacification different from the civil defence, if it is? 
A.	Well, pacification was based on an instruction that was signed on the 27th of April by the prime minister, and you have that document.  You have that instruction to restore calm -- instruction to restore calm in the country.  You have that document, whereas civil defence was based on a document of the 25th of May instituting the civil defence programme.  

So there is a difference between the two.  The document clearly spells out the goals and purposes of the civil defence programme which, at paragraph 4, if I am not mistaken, reference is made to the purpose of the civil defence, and that was a very clear and specific purpose that is outlined at that paragraph. 
Q.	Okay.  We have those documents in evidence, Mr. Niyitegeka, but I want your testimony.  Tell us what was achieved by the pacification programme or how it was supposed to work.
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, please, kindly help me by making those documents available to me.  It might help me to refresh my memory. 
Q.	I'm not interested in having the documents refresh your memory.  I'm asking you to reflect on the events of 1994 and your participation in the interim government and tell us about the programme or the policy of pacification.
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I think that the bottom line should be that we collaborate, we work together.  You can help me by providing me with those documents, and that will be of assistance, because my memory might not always be good.  And I am not at wrong if I do not remember, am I?
Q.	Well, let me suggest what the evidence should demonstrate about pacification and civil defence.  What I suggest to you is that pacification was a policy to send interim government ministers throughout the country to develop -- excuse me, to deliver at the local level the message of the government.  And they did that by organising meetings with territorial administrators, with bourgmestres and conseillers and cellule leaders.  

So independent of what was being said on the radio, your government had a way of reaching the population by sending ministers out to speak with local authorities, including the cellule leaders who were being paid by the government.  

That's what I would suggest to you.  Do you dispute that characterisation?  
A.	Part of your suggestion is correct and the other part is incorrect, so it's full of traps.  And I wasn't expecting that you make such a suggestion before a Tribunal like this one.  Why are you trying to trap me?  Who was paid for that purpose who was not a state employee?  When did people go to the préfectures to convey pacification messages?  

Well, I spoke about myself.  I went to Butare on the 30th of April with a pacification message.  I have -- I called on the officials to photocopy the message and publish them in public places.  So this message is clear.  I went to Butare -- not to my area.  I was there with Nsabumukunzi, who is a native of Butare, and Habineza, who is a native of Gisenyi.  

The point, therefore, is that the concept of pacification is one with which I am familiar.  I participated in it.  I had a team.  I worked with that team, and I was myself involved in that pacification exercise, cassette number 945 of 30 April.  You have it.  You have that information.  Please read through it and listen to it.  

I am ready to answer any questions that you may want to raise on the content of that cassette.  Now, as for the civil defence movement, I never went anywhere.  You yourself have said that it is former soldiers like Simba and Ntibitura and Ukulikiyeyezu.  Neither Simba nor Ukulikiyeyezu are people that I could represent.  So you cannot ask me to talk about civil -- about pacification, rather, but I have talked to you about self-defence.  And the evidence is there, and you have it with you.  So if you want to raise any questions with me on the pacification meeting, please do, and I will see how I can answer.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  We have your response.  But with respect to civil defence, what I'd like to suggest to you is that it was just a cover for the Interahamwe.  It was simply a means of putting the Interahamwe at the disposal of the interim government.  
A.	That is your opinion.  But I would never have associated with the Interahamwe.  Never.  Not in any circumstance.  We of the MDR -- we had our own youth group known as the JDR, the JDR, the Jeunesse démocratique républicaine.  So we couldn't have been taking care of the JDR and the Interahamwe at the same time, whereas the Interahamwe were our rivals. 
Q.	Yes, the Interahamwe may have been your rivals before the 6th of April.  But after the 6th of April all of these youth of the Hutu Power wings combined with the Interahamwe in the civil defence.  That's the whole point that I'm making.  

Civil defence was dominated by the Interahamwe, and it was a means of getting all of the youths together to support the interim government, the armed, trained, mobilised, militarised party youth wings under the leadership of the Interahamwe.
A.	Well, that is your opinion.  That is the Prosecution case.  And I cannot stop you from prosecuting as you wish.  So that is your opinion.  That is your case.  And I must say that this is not reality -- it doesn't reflect the reality. 
Q.	Well, you would at least agree that there were government-controlled paramilitary militias at the disposal of the interim government; isn't that true?  Independent of the army or working with the army, but it was a separate militia force at the disposal of the Abatabazi government.
A.	Such a militia never existed.  I have already told you that the civil defence programme, or the document for the civil defence programme, was signed on the 25th of May, but it never took effect.  So I don't know whether the translator did not translate me properly or interpret me properly.  I think this is clear.  Where would the government have gotten such a paramilitary group from, whereas the whole programme was not effective?  I have told you that it was not effective.

1215H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Do you recall being asked about government-controlled paramilitary militias by a journalist, 
	Philippe Dahinden, on the 9th of May 1994 in Murambi? 
A.	In Murambi, yes.  I was questioned by a number of journalists and I answered several questions from journalists.  I said very many things to journalists at that time.  So maybe you may want to jog my memory a little. 
Q.	Well, there is one interview in particular that interests me, and it took place on 9th May.  And it was actually video recorded, and the person interviewing you is Philippe Dahinden, who is a 
Swiss journalist.  Certainly you know or you remember Mr. Dahinden, don't you? 
A.	Yes, I recall Philippe Dahinden, and I do recall that I received him. 
MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Issa could assist me, he could pass up document number 23 in my bundle to the witness.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	This is a document in French.  I don't have a translation.  I've numbered the paragraphs so that we can find it easier in the text.  And it's a transcription of an audio -- excuse me, a video cassette.  It's KV000419.  

And I'm particularly interested in the paragraphs I've numbered 4, 5 and 6.  Where I've numbered paragraph 4, and I believe it's page 3 of this transcription, Mr. Dahinden is asking you about the relationship between the government and the military.  And your response is that the military serves the government, and not the other way around.  So you take responsibility on behalf of the interim government for what the soldiers are doing.  And then when we continue, where I've numbered 5 and 6, he starts to ask you about government-controlled militias.  And here I'm going to simply read the 
French text:  

Question:  "Does the government control the paramilitary militia which are known to exist across the country?"  

Answer:  "Controlling paramilitary militia -- by the way, does that militia exist?  We must make sure that such a militia exists, because the situation as is and the military and political setup as are -- in fact, 
the -- such a militia does not exist.  What I can tell you is that the population has organised itself and knows how to organise itself.  It is organised or is set up into cellule, secteur, commune and préfecture.  So when the country is invaded by the enemy, the cellules organise themselves, the secteurs organise themselves, the communes organise themselves as administrative entities and try to defend the country in collaboration with the army, with the soldiers who are involved in defending the country.  Generally speaking, the militia is supervised by the local authority préfecture."  
Question:  "The militia are also supervised by political parties?"  

Answer:  "Yes, indeed.  Political parties work in close collaboration with local authorities."  

Question:  "Those militia are armed, and I think that fact has been established."  

Answer:  "Yes.  In some area -- in some areas they have arms.  But where you have been -- apart from grenades, you have not seen any civilians in possession of guns.  But when you go right to Kigali, you will find that there are some roadblocks that are manned exclusively by civilians.  At those roadblocks there are no soldiers.  They are manned exclusively by civilians.  So we gave weapons to those civilians.  And not only to those civilians, but now we also distributed weapons to many people because we at least thought that if we have to fight the guerillas and maquisards we also have to upgrade our defence mechanisms and also to use the population to train them, to build awareness in them and to arm them so that when the enemy happens upon a farmer who is farming in his farm, that farmer should be able to defend himself.  We have no choice but to proceed in that manner."  And then it goes on.  

At paragraph 7 there is another question: "How then do you avoid any excesses which, as you said, you were not able to avoid in the beginning, but that you are now able to control, particularly with respect to the killings of civilian members of the population?"  

Answer:  "Yes, killings took place.  We have been to all préfectures across the country in order to build awareness within the population, and messages to the population have been broadcast over radio so that the entire population may be aware of these messages.  There have also been calls to stop killings and to stop killing each other, because we did not inherit this earth by killing each other.  We also told them to know how to identify the enemy and how to distinguish RPF members from the rest of the population, because the attacks should be against the enemy and not against anyone else."  

All right.  There I have read the text in French, Mr. Niyitegeka, essentially so that it could be understood by the English speakers as well through the translation.  

So this is what you were saying to Philippe Dahinden back on the 9th of May.  Doesn't that run counter to what you were just telling us a few moments ago?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, how does that contradict what I have just said?  Dahinden's question was to find out whether militia existed and I myself in answer was wondering whether the militia do exist.  They do not exist. 
Q.	Didn't you also say to Mr. Dahinden that the militias were organised at the local level, that the 
	political parties worked hand in hand with local territorial authorities to organise these militias, that there were killings; doesn't all that -- 
A.	Except we are saying that I lied to Dahinden.  If my answer to the first question about controlling militia, and now I -- in the first question we wondered whether the militia exists because given the military and political situation the militia as such does not exist.  That was my answer.  What else do you expect me to say?  What do you want?  What else do you want me to say?  
Q.	Well, if you stand by now -- by your testimony now, you're endorsing everything you said to Mr. Dahinden back on the 9th of May 1994, I have no issue with you, Mr. Niyitegeka, because that's essentially what I'm trying to achieve through your testimony today.  That is what you said and this is what you believed back on the 9th of May.  There were militia.  They were organised at the local level.  The government had a role in organising them.  The political parties had a role in organising them.  Isn't that what you say back on the 9th of May? 
A.	If you read my answers carefully to Dahinden, it was mainly for his own consumption.  I was answering to a journalist.  I was answering a journalist and not a judge.  Here we are in court.  We are also before an international tribunal.  And I must say that I provided the information to the journalist for his own consumption and for the consumption of his audience.  That must not necessarily coincide with my statement or my testimony before the judges of an international tribunal.  At least you can acknowledge that.  

You have done well to bring this document forward, because it shows that I clearly told the journalists that the militia did not exist, less so before the 25th of May when the civil defence programme was set up.  

So that was for the journalist's consumption and we were in times of war.  I knew where he was coming from.  I knew that he was from the RPF.  So this was a war speech, so to speak, at the time.  But it was not necessarily the reality -- a reflection of reality. 
Q.	Okay.  We have your response and we also have the video tape which the Chamber can review to see exactly in what vein you were making these explanations to the journalist.  
A.	Well, it is not necessary to -- to view the -- the cassette.  I do not deny having been interviewed by him, Dahinden, on that day.  I knew him.  I know him.  He's a Swiss journalist.  We know ourselves.  We know each other.  So I do not deny the fact that I granted him an interview.  I do not deny that I said the things that are recorded.  But I've told you it was designed for his own consumption, for the purpose of his audience, and that this was part of our war strategy because I was speaking to somebody whom I knew was coming from the zone or from the -- or on the part of the opponents of the RPF, so it was part of our war strategy. 
Q.	Well, didn't you realise you were speaking to the international community through your taped interview with Dahinden?  You knew he was a Swiss journalist and that everything you said was going to be reported in the western world, didn't you?  How could you possibly have assumed that he was getting information to help the RPF? 
A.	Well, the international community knew that we were experiencing war.  Those were wartimes.  And who were we fighting?  Who was behind the war?  We need to clarify all these matters.  

Mr. Prosecutor, you see, we can -- if you want, we can say everything openly.  We can tell you how the international community abandoned us during the war, whereas it is the international community itself which sparked off this war, which started this war.  If you want, we can say everything in the open.  The international community is responsible for everything that happened.  And now it has set up a Tribunal, whereas it is that international community that is behind everything.

Now, fortunately, last week President Sarkozy confessed that they made a mistake in abandoning us.  But the entire international community ought to come to that recognition too, that they started this war and then they abandoned us, just like that.  We asked them to come to our assistance; and instead of helping us, they abandoned us.  And then now they set up a Tribunal to judge us, whereas they are actually responsible for this thing.  It is an absurdity. 
Q.	Okay.  We have your response.  But I'm curious about your statement about -- the phrase in your last response about the international community coming to the assistance of your government, because when we go to the transcript of your interview on Radio Rwanda on the 30th of April 1994, which is the transcript that you've been asking us to come to for so long, you make that same appeal to the population.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And here I direct the parties to documents 14 and 15 in my bundle, 14 is the English text and 
	15 is the French.  

And if Mr. Issa could help me by handing this document up to the witness. 

And I see the time.  We're going to have to end this soon. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	But what I'd request, Mr. Niyitegeka, is that you take this document with you over the lunchtime.  And that way you can read the whole thing and you will be comfortable for my questions when we return.  

But the constant refrain through the whole document is your appeal on behalf of the interim government for the population to come to the assistance of the interim government.  

Where I've indicated para -- number 2 on the document, it's numbered in both the French text and the English text, you are saying:  "I am calling you, Abatabazi," referring to the radio public, "I am calling you, Abatabazi, because we would like all of you to help us.  The government needs your support.  The current government led by Prime Minister Jean Kambanda self-proclaimed itself the 
government of Abatabazi."  

And then you go on.  You can read -- pay particular attention to wherever I have numbered a paragraph, because you say over and over again in your appeal that the population needs to come to the assistance of the government.  When you began testifying yesterday you were telling us that the government was coming to assist the population.

So give that some thought and we can pick up after lunch.  
A.	What I can say up front is that your comment is incorrect, but I am happy that we're going to revisit it.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  This is a good time to take our luncheon adjournment now.
(Court recessed from 1232H to 1422H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon.

You may continue, Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you.

Good afternoon, everyone. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Good afternoon to you, Mr. Niyitegeka.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
Q.	I hope you've had an opportunity to read through the transcripts that we looked at the very end of the morning session, the transcripts of the Radio Rwanda broadcast of 30 April 1994.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your -- Your Hon -- I need the interpretation in French. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	I hope that you were able to read through the transcripts that I gave you at the end of the 
	morning session, the transcripts of the 30th April 1994.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Mr. Registrar, there might be a problem with the French -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
It is because the channel on his -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Judge Kam is making the same complaint.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay.  If you don't mind, we'll continue in French.
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
That will be on channel 3, Judge Kam. 
THE WITNESS:
Say something.  I will hear you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I think I'm being directed to tell the French speakers to turn their apparatus to channel 3. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Channel 2 for French. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Is everything okay now?  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Do you hear me, Mr. Niyitegeka? 
A.	Yes, I do now. 
Q.	So I'd like us to turn to the transcripts of the Radio Rwanda broadcast on the 30th of April 1994.  That is where we ended this morning.  Did you have a chance to read through those over the lunch hour? 
A.	Yes, I did.  I perused it. 
Q.	Okay.  I'd like to go through it very quickly, or as quickly as possible.  

So I've numbered the paragraphs that interest me, and let's start with paragraph number 1.  And everyone should be able to follow in the French and the English because they all have the 
same numbers, where I have indicated on the left column.  

Apparently you're in Butare.  You're addressing the préfet, representatives of the 
religious denominations, representatives of the political parties at the préfectoral and communal level, sous-préfets, bourgmestres, conseillers, head of services, and you refer to them all as "Abatabazi".  
All right?  

And then we continue.  And where I've indicated number 2 you tell them that:  "I am calling you Abatabazi because we would like all of you to help us.  The government needs your support."  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then you complain that foreign media, in particular radio stations, are giving the impression that this government is composed of killers.  So you're already recognising that --
A.	Yes. 
Q.	-- that your government has a reputation for being killers.  

And then when you go to paragraph 7, you say:  "We're asking you to join us so that together we can fight the enemy who is propagating such stories with the intention of exonerating themselves, whereas he has blood on his hands."  

Then we continue to paragraph 9:  "Our government is a government of liberators and we are crying out for help.  Come to our rescue."  

And then at 10:  "Let me repeat, our government is a government of Abatabazi.  We are calling out for help.  Come to our aid."  

And then at 11, you're asking the bishops to transmit this message to their faithfuls during 
church service.  "Bourgmestres should transmit the message to those under their authority.  
Conseiller de secteur should do the same."  

At paragraph 12 you say:  "We have received a message from the government of Abatabazi calling on everyone" -- "everybody to come to its aid."  

At paragraph 13:  "We asked for the message to be aired, but we thought it necessary to dispatch members of government and representatives of political parties to the préfectures to ask you to help us."  

And at 14:  "We know that the enemy is present here in the country.  We know that there are accomplices here, even here in Butare."

At 15 you say:  "I repeat, the enemy's agents are everywhere.  Collaborators of the enemy exist.  So do not be distracted.  For although we say we want peace, there should be no respite for an enemy that you have already identified."  

At 16:  "The enemy's collaborators are easy to identify since we have already discovered their characteristics." 

Turn the page to paragraph 17:  "Come to the aid of the government of Abatabazi, and you should all be Abatabazi.  Spread this message out on your hills and in the establishments where you work.  Know that we are all Abatabazi, that we already know who the enemy is.  He is called Inkotanyi.  Inkotanyi are not only found in Kajeli (sic) and Butare" -- or, rather -- "they are not only found in Ruhengeri and Byumba, but also in Butare.  Be vigilant, identify them and do not look out only for them."  Right?  
A.	Carry on.  Follow -- read the next sentence.  "Don't attack someone because of his ethnic origin."  
	Carry on with the next phrase.  Read the next sentence. 
Q.	"Be vigilant.  Be vigilant.  Identify them and do not look out only for them.  Do not attack a person because of his ethnic origin, because he is handsome or ugly, tall or short, rich or poor.  Every person has a right to life except the enemy, for the simple reason that he is the enemy."  

And then at 18:  "We will no longer tolerate people talking about a government of killers.  If you fold your arms, even when we have told you how to help us combat crime, we have a shared responsibility.  If we are found guilty of mass killing, we will say that we are not the only killers.  In fact, Niyitegeka has not killed anybody.  Neither has Habineza.  Similarly, no minister has killed.  That said, to say that this is a government of killers" -- and then it breaks off.

So wouldn't you agree this seems like a cry of desperation?  You told us initially that the 
Abatabazi government was put together to help the people, and here you are calling on the people to save the government.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  To begin with, you are attributing intentions that I never had.  You just said that we recognised that we were a government of killers.  That is not true.  That is not true.  You have your manner of reading and yet the text is very, very clear.  

If you look at paragraph number 3:  "Foreign media, particularly foreign governments and media, are wanting you to believe that this government is made up of killers.  And those who are listening to them convey this information without cross-checking."  

They can say all what they want, but that description will never be permanently attached to our government.  Is that acknowledgment?  Let me tell you why it is settled that the former 
head of state of Rwanda -- and it is settled that the former heads of state of Rwanda and Burundi and members of their delegations were murdered on 6 April and that the present government was set up on 9 April.  What role did this government play for it to be described as a government of killers?  Were those personalities not killed?  

Instead of focussing attention on the murderers of the personalities and prosecuting them, the government set up on April 9 after the killing is being held as responsible and described as a government of killers.  After those personalities died, things took a turn for the worse.  From that very night, right to the next day, the first wave of refugees might perhaps have arrived in your locality here on the 8th.   

It was on the 9th that members of the present government were sworn into office.  But then were there no deaths recorded on the 7th and the 8th?  Were people not killed?  How, therefore, could this government be described as a government of killers, whereas it had not been set up at the time?  Why not talk about those who killed those personalities, instead of talking about a government of killers? 
As far as I am concerned, I was doing rounds when I was contacted at the time.  I did not know that I was going to become a minister.  I was doing rounds to ensure my own security because the enemy had attacked the country.  The Inkotanyi, who are at the CND, had come out and there were other Inkotanyi everywhere.  And you go on.  

And then 7 -- no, rather, 8:  "The government was set up on 9 April.  Two days later, on the 11th April, the government left Kigali and set up elsewhere following the bombings directed towards the town.  If the government were carrying out the killings, why would it run away?  Do you understand that?  
Tell me.  I'm asking you.  What caused the government to escape?  What?  How can a government that is being hunted down be said to be killers?  Why are people not asking themselves whom the government was escaping from?  Have we escaped from the Rwandan army, our own soldiers?" 

And I'll go on.  Further on -- later on, towards the end of the paragraph:  "Now, I am asking you:  Who is the killer?  Is the killer the person who states that in 48 hours I would have exterminated all of you?  Or is he the person who does not know how to manage on his own?"  You see.  

It is these questions that have not been answered, and it is the responsibility of the 
international community.  It knew.  It was aware of that which was going on, and -- and was rather supporting the aggressor.  Just -- just what could we do?  

Now permit me to continue, please, because you have -- because you have mentioned a number of points.  
Q.	Yes.  But you are not addressing the points I raised.  You're simply reading the rest of the speech.  So effectively, all we're doing is reading the same speech you gave back on the 30th of April 1994.  

What I'd like you to do is respond to the point that I'm making when I refer to selective passages in 
your speech.  One is that you recognise that the international community is already calling you a government of killers.  That's number 1.  All right.  And, number 2, you are calling on the population to save the government and directing them to fight the enemy to do so and telling them that the enemy is not only at the battle front in Ruhengeri, but also in Butare.  
A.	But you're not giving any value to the questions which I raised during the meeting, and it wouldn't be accurate.  And then, as to saying that I recognise or acknowledge, I know I was listening to 
	international radios.  Instead of listening to local radios, which you accuse me of, I was listening to the BBC.  I was listening to the Voice of America and I knew what they were saying.  I listened to 
	Radio Muhabura every morning.  Unfortunately, you did not give me the cassettes of Radio Muhabura and sometimes I answered in -- and even in my speeches when I said that they were going to take the country in 48 hours I was answering the statements made by Radio Muhabura, for example.

And so, if you don't mind, let me give you another sentence from this speech where I asked people to help us.  I said:  "Your Excellencies" -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Microphone not activated) 
THE WITNESS:
I'm listening to you, Mr. Prosecutor -- Mr. President. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, your microphone is off. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

If you want your testimony to be recorded, you're going to have to speak a bit more slowly.  Everybody's having difficulty keeping up with you. 
THE WITNESS:
I'm sorry.  I'll do the best I can, Mr. President.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'll try my best, Mr. President.  Thank you.

So I was saying at the foot of page 7, I said:  "Your Excellencies had the deep wish to have 
peace and security restored in our nation.  That is the wish of government."  And that is what we were asking the personalities who had been invited to the meeting, that is what we called upon them to do.  And I had said the translation -- Abatabazi is translated as "liberator".  That is not true because gutabara means to assist someone who is in danger, someone who is desperate.  It is not to liberate as such.  But Abatabazi is those who are going to the rescue of others.  

The country was in distress, the entire population.  And it is in that sentence -- in that sense that you need to understand the speech that I was making.  Abatabazi does not mean "liberator".  It does not mean "saviour".  These were people who are going to the rescue of those who were in distress.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Thank you for that.  And what I'm suggesting to you is that it was your government that was in distress and you were calling upon the people to save your government.  And the policy you were recommending, in a roundabout way, was for them to kill the Tutsi all across the country because your conception of security for the Rwandan nation was a nation that was free of Tutsi.  That was the message that you were delivering.  
A.	You cannot change that which is written, because the written text is right here.  I said if those -- if 
	those -- I'm sorry.  I said on page -- I just said it a few minutes ago.  So government -- yes, it was government, not the population, the government is talking to representatives of the population to help to contribute to ensure that security's restored, and you have enumerated them.  And so I find that only normal.  

I don't know how -- how can we walk in otherwise?  What should I have done in your opinion, Prosecutor?  Yes, our deepest wish is to see peace and security restored in our country.  That is government's wish.  It is the wish of government to eliminate Tutsis?  It is not written anywhere.  

And if you don't mind, I can read to you another sentence on page 14. 
Q.	The entire text is in evidence.  The Chamber will have an opportunity to read every word and pass every word at a later time.  But let's move on because there are other aspects of the broadcast which I would like us to examine.  

While you were addressing the people of Butare, Prime Minister Kambanda was addressing the people in Gikongoro.  Isn't that so?  There was a government delegation.  If you look where I have number 19.  So you have a journalist from Radio Rwanda announcing --
A.	But there are a lot of questions which you asked that I have not yet answered.  Permit me to answer those questions, please.  
Q.	We'll come back to it, Mr. Niyitegeka, because there's a lot of ground that I have to cover.  You can address anything else --   
A.	But then those should be redacted from the records because I did not have the opportunity to answer them.  It is unfair that you don't give the opportunity to a witness to answer questions, questions that were addressed to me personally.  I think that would be unfair and unjust.  So permit me to read sentences which answer the sentences which you put and which you read to me. 
Q.	We will move on.  When we're finished dealing with the entire transcription, then you can come back to the issue that you want to raise.  But now we're looking at paragraph -- that I have numbered, paragraph 19, which indicates -- 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
I beg your pardon, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, as a matter of methodology, can you please allow the witness to answer, because we know that the Prosecutor will never get back to this issue.  It's an issue -- it's a matter of going fast over this issue, just glossing over them.  And since the records have them, it would only be fair, as demanded by the witness, to -- for him -- to allow him to answer those questions.  And at this point we ask you to step in.  
And by the way, Mr. President, no one should talk to us about -- of complementary questions, because these are questions that have been put in the course of the cross-examination and we wish to have them answered. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, my suggestion to the witness is that we will deal with the entire transcription and he will have an opportunity at the end of that portion of my questions to make the comments he deems appropriate.  

So I'd like to continue.  I plan on covering everything in my outline, and we're losing time in the way that we're proceeding now.  So I'm certainly not trying to prevent Mr. Niyitegeka from being responsive, but I think it would be more efficient if I go through the entire transcription and then he can direct us to what he thinks is important. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We think that the -- your answers have been very extensive and we feel that we should allow the Prosecutor to conduct his examination the way he wishes to, because we are beginning to look at the time that his cross-examination is taking.  I would suggest that you make a brief note of the points that you wish to make.  You'll have an opportunity to address them when he's finished his outline.

Okay.  You may continue, Mr. Webster.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Niyitegeka, let's look at paragraph 19, where a Radio Rwanda journalist is indicating that he's reporting on a meeting with a government delegation, which includes Kambanda, prime minister, 
	the préfet of Gikongoro, Laurent Bucyabaruta (phonetic).  And if you turn the page and go to 
paragraph 20, he mentions the presence of Daniel Bangura, the minister of higher education; 
Prosper Mugiraneza; Emmanuel Ndindabahizi; as well as Édouard Karemera and Donat Murego, representing the MRND and MDR respectively.  

So this is another government delegation that is apparently involved in a pacification meeting in Gikongoro while you are addressing the people in Butare, and both meetings were radio broadcast to the entire nation.  Can we agree on that much?  Do you recall the events as I have just suggested?  
A.	Well, this rather corresponds to what I said this morning when I told you that teams had been set up, teams to pacify the people.  I was in the team that was assigned to extend these messages in Butare.  There was another team that went to Gikongoro as well as to other préfectures.  And you would realise or note that the ministers did not go to préfectures -- the préfectures of origin, as you claim to say, as you claim, because if Karemera went to Gikongoro, Karemera is not from Gikongoro.  And by the 
	time -- by the way, he was not yet minister.  He went there as a political leader.  But there were other ministers who went there and they were not ministers who hailed from that region.  Kambanda himself was not from Gikongoro. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  We have your response.  

And at paragraph 21 we see that Prime Minister Jean Kambanda said that he was proud of 
Gikongoro préfecture since it had implemented the programme of the government.  All right?  
A.	Yes, but in what?  Particularly in restoring -- to restore security.  Don't forget that stretch of the sentence, "but especially to restore security". 
Q.	This was on the 30th of April, just nine days after major massacres all throughout Gikongoro préfecture; isn't that so?  Was that how security was restored, through the widespread killings that took place in several different locations on the 27th of April? 
A.	At the time he was delivering the speech there were no more killings.  And you notice that in my own speech I began by enumerating the killings that began on the 6th of April -- on the 6th of April.  And I asked people to ensure that these killings are stopped. 
Q.	Let's look -- let's look at what I have numbered as paragraph 22.  It is on page 12 of the English text.  And here it is Kambanda again saying that the pacification campaign is going on.  

"Government delegations are scouring the country to meet with local authorities and find ways and means of restoring calm throughout the country, the calm jeopardised by the assassination of 
head of state."  

Right?  Which is consistent with what you have just told us, that there are a number -- various delegations that are going about the country to develop -- to deliver the message.  
A.	Well, I'm lost.  I don't know where exactly you are. 
Q.	Okay.  Well --   
A.	I can't find what you're saying.  In my sheets I have you until 21, please. 
Q.	And you turn several pages and you'll come across 22.  
A.	All right.  Okay.  Okay.  I agree with you.  On page 20 -- thank you.  Speaker:  
	Gilbert Wamatuara (phonetic), journalist of Radio Rwanda.  It is not the prime minister.  
Q.	In any case -- I apologise for the mistake.  But in any case, he's telling us exactly what you said, which is that government delegations are going all around the country to effect its policy of pacification.  

And then when we get to paragraph 23, a few pages on, and I believe this is -- it's not clear whether it's Kambanda or not.  I suggest that it is, but that's not essential.  Look at the text.  It says:  "The first point concerns that circular that we sent to all préfets which contains instructions to be applied under the present circumstances so that peace can be restored in the country."  

And here I would suggest to you that he's referring to the instructions on restoring security of the 
27th of April, which is a document that you referred to earlier.  And it says:  "We congratulate you, the citizens of Gikongoro préfecture, because instead of waiting for instructions to be given to you, you yourselves took certain measures to ensure peace in your préfecture."  

And what I'm suggesting to you, Mr. Niyitegeka, is that what is being referred to are the killings that took place on the 21st of April led by Aloys Simba, who was responsible for the civil defence in Gikongoro.  
A.	Here in the document it is noted that, "You yourself took certain measures to restore peace in your prefecture."  And so if the local authorities took the measures to restore security in their préfecture, what is wrong with that?  I don't see anything wrong with that.  

More so, Simba, whom you're referring to, had not yet been appointed in charge of the civil defence, because we are here in April, while Simba was not appointed before the 25th of May, before the signature of the document for the civil defence programme. 
Q.	Well, you have your way of analysing this text.  I have the analysis and the suggestion that I would like to urge.  The Chamber will have an opportunity to read through it and make its own assessment of what is being communicated.  

But what I am suggesting to you is what is deftly being communicated to the people of Gikongoro and Butare is that eliminating the Tutsi was the way in which security would be restored in Rwanda.  

And on the issue of Simba's appointment, what I would suggest to you is that the 
civil defence programme was implemented long before the 25th of May, long before it was documented in a memorandum from Karemera that had been the policy from the very beginning of the 
interim government.  It was simply documented on the 25th of May 1994.  So respond to that, please.  
A.	You said I have my way of interpreting this document.  It is you who has your method of interpreting and distorting the real meaning of words and speeches in your interests, making them crimes, and yet these are clear for anybody who can read.  

	Anybody who has eyes, eyes that can read, it is clear, the speeches are clear.  The name of Simba is not here.  And I repeat it, this speech was delivered on the 30th of April, and yet this guy was appointed after the 25th of May.  How come -- how can you make such a decision?  In all honesty, the only logic here just shows that is absurd. 
Q.	Well, tell us, Mr. Niyitegeka, how did you expect the population in Butare and Gikongoro, far from the battles lines, the lines of battle with the RPF army, to distinguish their enemy from their neighbours?  You tell the people to fight the enemy, that is, the enemy among them, whereas the soldiers of the RPF were nowhere near that location in Butare and certainly not in Gikongoro.  How did you expect the population to distinguish the enemy from the neighbours?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, you seem to impugn or question the fact that the enemy had infiltrated the country, including Butare and Gikongoro, but this is the reality.  

I refer you once again to the statement of Joshua Bizibiza (phonetic), right here in this Tribunal.  And he is part of the commander network of the RPF.  He said -- denounced his experience.  I don't know why you stick to defending them and to defending criminals, instead of prosecuting them instead.  Eh?  It's -- it's an embarrassment.
(Pages 27 to 41 by Melissa Hook)





























1500H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, were you aware of the press conference that was held in Nairobi on the 
	28th of April 1994 where Justin Mugenzi and Mathieu Ngirumpatse represented the interim government? 
A.	I know that towards the 28th of April they were on mission abroad, but I do not know about the speech that they may have given. 
Q.	You participated in the interim government meeting on the 17th of May 1994 in Murambi.  This was a cabinet meeting that involved -- excuse me.  This was a meeting of interim government ministers where the issue of the civil defence was raised.
A.	I indeed took part in that meeting, and I gave a report of that meeting.  You have my report in one of your cassettes. 
Q.	Do you recall the presence of Gaspard Ruhumuliza during that meeting? 
A.	There's a strong likelihood that he was at that meeting, that he was present. 
Q.	Well, he claims to have been present, and he provides an account of that meeting.  And he also says that Ngirumpatse participated in the meeting and Nzirorera participated in the meeting.  Is that your recollection? 
A.	That is a lie, and as I said to you before, the cabinet minister -- cabinet meeting involved ministers only and no other people.  And neither Ngirumpatse nor Nzirorera were ministers. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Niyitegeka, I think if you look at the diaries of Pauline Nyiramasuhuko and 
	Kambanda's diaries, you will see that many meetings were described as "cabinet meetings élargi", enlarged.  And it included representatives of the political parties including the MRND.  

So perhaps I was inaccurate when I described it as a cabinet meeting, but there were many meetings of interim government ministers with heads of the political parties including this one on the 17th of May which addressed civil defence.
A.	I am not referring to Nyiramasuhuko but to Kambanda.  What I would like to know is whether you are saying the truth, that on the 7th of May he noted that it was an enlarged cabinet meeting because that would be a surprising thing to me because I attended that meeting and I reported it.  I remember it. 
Q.	Not the 7th.  The 17th of May.  And I'm not relying on Kambanda's diary.  I'm relying on the statement of Gaspard Ruhumuliza.  Wasn't there a cabinet meeting or a meeting of interim government ministers which permitted Mathieu Ngirumpatse to make a report to it of the results of his mission?  Because he had just come back from mission -- I believe it was on the 15th of May.  

And the information that I have is that he made a report on that mission, the results of his mission, to the interim government on the 17th of May during that same meeting where civil defence was discussed. 
A.	That meeting, as far as I am concerned, was not a cabinet meeting. 
Q.	Well, we don't have to call it a cabinet meeting.  It was a meeting of interim government ministers -- Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera.  And you all were discussing civil defence.
A.	I didn't personally attend that meeting, Counsel for the Prosecution.  I don't know that meeting. 
Q.	Did you participate in the meeting on the 17th of June where the reappointment of Kajelijeli was discussed? 
A.	Yes.  I was in attendance, and I reported it in cassette number 1,053. 
Q.	And what was the controversy surrounding the appointment of Kajelijeli that was discussed in that meeting?
A.	But, Counsel for the Prosecutor, the appointment of the bourgmestre concerned only the 
	minister of the interior.  The minister of the interior proposed a list of people to the cabinet, and the government approved the minister of interior's proposal. 
Q.	Well, I think you're inaccurate on that point.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
And if I could have Mr. Issa hand this document up to the witness.  This is Prosecution Exhibit -- I believe it's 422.  And this is an entry in the diary of the minister of planning, Augustin Ngirabatware.  
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	And the issue of Kajelijeli's appointment had come up on the 10th of June and then again on the 
	17th of June.  And obviously it was important to the minister of planning because he writes it down in his diary where he says, "The interim bourgmestre that had been appointed by the préfet, Semahane, whereas, a preselection had taken place.  Kajelijeli had been appointed -- had been elected in the preselection, but the population demanded his return, demanded the return of Kajelijeli, and that it has to be considered."

So apparently, there was some discussion of who should be appointed the bourgmestre of Mukingo, the appointment that was suggested by the préfet, which was Semahane, or the person that was eventually appointed by the interim government, Kajelijeli.  Do you know anything about that?
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I am unaware of these comments.  As a matter of fact, you can see that appointment of the bourgmestre -- maybe they were appointed.  It's a list.  It's a mere list.  And that there was a comment made by Ngirabatware on that name -- I don't think this is a verbatim report of the meeting.  I think it's just a personal comment. 
Q.	Well, maybe that's one of the meetings you missed on the 17th of June.  Because obviously, he found the discussion noteworthy of making a substantial entry in his agenda.  So if you don't remember it, maybe that's one of the meetings you missed. 
A.	It is not true.  I was at the meeting, and I made a report, and I had it broadcast on the morning of the 18th at 6 a.m. over Radio Rwanda.  I was at the meeting.  And if it is required and if you do allow me to do so, I would look for the notes, and I can also find them.  
Q.	The notes that were destroyed by the weather in Zaire or left behind when you fled Gitarama?
A.	No.  But was it the day before yesterday or yesterday?  You wondered why your people did not seize everything, and I told you that not everything had been destroyed.  It is true that there are notes which I can't find.  But those -- I don't know if I can find them.  But I am telling the Chamber that I may be able to find it. 
Q.	Well, if you find them, you can send them to us, Mr. Niyitegeka.  We'd be happy to receive them.
A.	Give me the time. 
Q.	Aside from the May 3 meeting in Kibuye, did you participate in other meetings in Kibuye?  The May 3 meeting was broadcast.  There are minutes of it.  Your comments are recorded as part of your judgement by Trial Chamber I.  I don't need to go into details of the May 3 meeting.  I'm trying to find out from you if you attended other meetings in Kibuye.
A.	None.  No meeting. 
Q.	But you must have had some interaction with the regional authorities in Kibuye, with Préfet Kayishema for example.
A.	What date are you referring to?  
Q.	I'm asking you to tell us any occasion that you met with Kayishema in Kibuye. 
A.	I met Kayishema on the 29th of April in the afternoon. 
Q.	Any other time?
A.	31 May.  I believe that's all.  No.  Hang on.  On the 19th of June.
Q.	And what about in July?  Did you encounter him anywhere in Kibuye in July? 
A.	I no longer recall. 
Q.	Édouard Karemera testified that he participated in a meeting with regional authorities in Kibuye on the 11th of July.  Were you a part of that meeting?
A.	I no longer recall. 
Q.	In any case, you would agree that based on your meetings or your encounters with Préfet Kayishema that he was well placed to provide information about what was happening in Kibuye préfecture?  Wouldn't you agree? 
A.	Yes.  When we met, we discussed everything about security within the préfecture. 
Q.	And didn't Kayishema make regular reports to the minister of the interior which would then be read or communicated to the other ministers in cabinet meetings?   
A.	Never.  That's not how the préfets worked.  They didn't -- the way that they worked, they reported to the minister of the interior and at times they copied the prime minister but not to all ministers.  To a minister directly concerned, maybe.  But in any case, not to all ministers. 
Q.	Yes.  But even if he was making reports directly to the minister of interior, wouldn't the 
	minister of interior brief the rest of the cabinet about the goings-on all across the country which would include Kibuye?
A.	He could have briefed the other ministers not only in Kibuye but everywhere in the country depending on the reports in his possession. 
Q.	So that's what I'm trying to find out from you.  Do you recall attending cabinet meetings where information or reports on what was happening in Kibuye were submitted to the minister of interior and discussed at the level of the cabinet?
A.	No.  Personally, I don't recall. 
Q.	Well, would you have any reason to mistrust the information that was provided to your government by Préfet Kayishema?
A.	I didn't quite understand your question. 
Q.	Would you have any reason to mistrust the information that Kayishema would provide to your government?  In other words, when he submitted reports to the minister of interior that were intended to inform your government of conditions in Kibuye, were you comfortable relying on his information?
A.	I believe that you should rephrase the question:  Did the minister of the interior trust the reports from Kayishema.  I think that is how you should put the question.  Did the minister of the interior trust the reports that were forwarded to him by Kayishema in which case I say that no report was ever sent to me because I could not have trusted a report I did not receive. 
Q.	Kayishema authored a report where he claims that "Calm has been returned progressively" as of the 25th of April 1994 in Kibuye.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, if I may, methodology.  Would the Prosecutor be so kind as to give both documents to the witness.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
We will have ample time to review the document.  I would like an answer to my question first.
THE WITNESS:
Would you be so kind as to ask me the question again.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Let me withdraw that question and ask another one.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	When Kayishema reports that Prime Minister Kambanda and President Sindikubwabo visited Kibuye on the 3rd of May and the 16th of May respectively, that was reliable information as far as you knew; right?   
A.	Report to who?  I didn't follow. 
Q.	I said when Kayishema reports that the Prime Minister Kambanda and President Sindikubwabo visited Kibuye on the 3rd of May and the 16th of May respectively, you know that that was reliable information.  You have no reason to mistrust that information; right?
A.	That is false.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The microphone is off, please.  The witness's microphone is off.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, could you repeat the dates, please.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes.  I'll break it down into two parts.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	When Préfet Kayishema reports that Prime Minister Kambanda visited Kibuye on the 3rd of May and reports that President Sindikubwabo visited Kibuye on the 16th of May, that's reliable information based on your own experience of the events.
A.	I know personally that the prime minister went to Kibuye and that the president of the republic went there on the 16th of May.  Whether there was a report or not about that, I already know that it is the truth.  It happened. 
Q.	And when he makes a report that the RPF Inkotanyi attacked in Gitarama and caused 
	displaced persons to move into Kibuye, that too is reliable, isn't it?
A.	But I don't have that report, Counsel for the Prosecutor.  You're asking me about something I don't have, and it is absurd.  You're asking me to acknowledge something which I do not have. 
Q.	I'm not asking you to acknowledge anything.  I'm asking you if you agree with that information, period.  So based on your own recollection of events, tell me if you think that that is accurate information.
A.	I can't tell if it is accurate or not.  I can't know. 
Q.	That is a legitimate answer.  I'm not telling you how to answer.  Just answer the question.  When Kayishema reports that there were two camps, apparently camps for displaced people, in Sanza and Kilinda-Birambo.  Is that accurate information?
A.	And who was he sending that report to?  I don't follow.  I don't understand what you are driving at. 
Q.	I asked you a simple question.  Is that information reliable based on your knowledge of the events?  Were there two camps, one in Sanza and the other in Kilinda-Birambo for displaced persons?
A.	Firstly, I don't know those localities.  I don't know where those places are found, to be frank.  So I can't see on what basis I can tell you if that is reliable or not.  I do not know those localities in the Kibuye préfecture. 
Q.	Was there a resumption of fighting between and within political parties towards the end of June in Kibuye?
A.	Between political parties?  Between political parties?  Which ones, please, are you referring to?  
Q.	Was there a problem with hunger in Kibuye despite the fact that it was sorghum harvesting season towards the end of June 1994?
A.	Now, considering the number of internally displaced persons who were flooding into that region, it's likely that you will have a problem with famine. 
Q.	Was there a problem with fugitives or refugees who were hiding in Gisovu and Gishyita? 
A.	You had refugees all over the country.  I do not deny the fact that there were refugees as they were all over the country.  Indeed I was a refugee myself in spite of the fact that I was a minister.  I had been displaced from my property. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
If Mr. Issa could hand this document up to the witness.  It's document number 18 in my bundle.  It's a handwritten memorandum written in the hand of Préfet Kayishema.  He dates it as around the 
	6th of July 1994.  We have the English translation which is typewritten which are the first few pages.  And then all we have is the handwritten text for the French.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
An objection, Mr. President.  But before that, I would like the Prosecutor to repeat what he just told the witness.  Did he use the word "memorandum"?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I characterised this as a draft letter or a memorandum which Kayishema himself dates as the 
	6th of July 1994 which was entered in evidence in his case after he identified it and gave it an approximate date.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:  
Mr. President, I would like to pray you to ask that the witness to whom a question has been asked -- that they should say specifically whether it is a memo or it is a draft as those terms cannot mean the same thing.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
If the term is offensive to the Defence, let me simply characterise it as a handwritten document.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And I'm going to read through parts of it.  You tell me if you agree with its contents, Mr. Niyitegeka.   
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:  
Objection, Mr. President.  I insist.  The witness has a document.  Irrespective of the characterisation of that document, it is incumbent on him.  But he needs to avoid to mislead the witness.  He needs to state whether it is a draft or a memo because the comments he's going to make will be dependent upon that.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I have no problem identifying this as a draft memorandum or a draft letter if that is the problem that the Defence is alluding to.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Niyitegeka, this is being characterised for your benefit as a draft letter.  So let's look at its contents now.  The first page he's writing to the minister of interior.  He's reporting that "Calm has been restored progressively as of the 25th of April 1994 and that it was after this period that we in Kibuye received the prime minister on the 3rd of May followed by the president of the republic on the 
	16th of May."

You've already agreed to the accuracy of that information.  On the matter of security, several meetings with the townspeople and the administrative authorities were held regarding the organisation of patrols and roadblocks in the context of civilian self-defence.  That's exactly what you asked local and 
regional authorities to do when the interim government issued its directives on civil defence on the 
25th of May 1994.  Isn't that so?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Then he goes on to say that, "The recruitment and training of able-bodied persons for civilian defence is underway throughout the préfecture."  That's exactly what the interim government asked to be done throughout Rwanda, and he's reporting on Kibuye.  Isn't that so?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Then he talks about Kivumu, Mwendo, Bwakira, Gishyita.  And in reference to those communes, he clarifies that they are "guarding strategic sites such as the mountaintops and hills.  However, the government will need to provide material support in the form of firearms because such a promise was made to the people as the Inkotanyi threat is felt on a daily basis at the Kibuye/Gitarama border."  That's reliable information based on your experience, Mr. Witness?
A.	The interesting thing is that they were trained to fight the Inkotanyi.  It wasn't for the elimination of the Tutsis.  It was to fight the Inkotanyi.  And this is stated clearly.  The Inkotanyi is the RPF.  It is not Tutsis. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you for that clarification.  It goes on to say that, "The creation of civil defence committees has progressively taken shape but there is a lack of military officers, reservists, and gendarmes."

And then a paragraph that he has numbered paragraph 2, "The RPF Inkotanyi attack in 
Gitarama préfecture caused the movement of displaced persons into Kibuye.  At first it was 
displaced persons on their way to Gisenyi and Cyangugu for people returning to their families and friends.  And now we have two camps of displaced persons."

Does that information seem reliable to you?
A.	Yes.  That is likely.  In any case, I didn't cross-check it.  In any case, I didn't cross-check the information. 
Q.	Then we get to the paragraph he has numbered paragraph 3, "The Bisesero area between Gisovu and Gishyita communes still present a danger for people in the area.  People have not succeeded in clearing the area.  Today a thousand fugitives have formed a camp protected by the French soldiers."

In paragraph 4 he goes on that "In the préfecture of Kibuye, the Inkotanyi infiltration has not declined.  Unfortunately, at the roadblocks there have been killings of soldiers and gendarmes whose papers are not in order.  Cases of this type have been cited in Gisovu, Kivumu, and Gitesi."

That's consistent with your own observations, is it not?  
A.	In any case, as far as Gisovu is concerned. 
Q.	And we know that's so because of Prosecution Exhibit 194 that you reviewed with Mr. Nimy which is the letter that you wrote on the 30th of June 1994 addressing the same issue; right? 
A.	But that's what I confirm in any case as far as Gisovu is concerned. 
Q.	And the letter goes on.  You can read it to yourself, but I would suggest to you that the information that Préfet Kayishema is providing in this draft letter is consistent with some of the accounts that you have provided yourself and consistent with your way, Mr. Niyitegeka, of presenting the situation that obtained in Kibuye towards the end of June 1994.
A.	Yes.  I can see the text.  Yes.  You can interpret it the way you wish.  You saw my report, didn't you?  You saw my letter.  It was detailed, the letter of the 30th of June.  I handed him a copy.  He deemed it as a matter of political rivalry which was his right to look at things the way he wanted.  Fortunately, in my letter I went into minute detail.  The truth is that, considering the circumstances, there was no followup.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I see the time.  It's 3:30.  I haven't completed everything I plan to do.  I think I can do that within the first 45 minutes or so tomorrow morning.  And that's what I'd like to do.  I've been trying to move ahead as quickly as possible.  And unfortunately, I haven't been able to meet my own deadlines.  But I think I can expeditiously wrap this up tomorrow morning.  I only have maybe two other issues to address.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  It is 3:30 now.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The President's microphone is off.  Would somebody be so kind as to inform the President that his microphone is off.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We will take the adjournment now and resume tomorrow morning.  
(Court adjourned at 1535H)
