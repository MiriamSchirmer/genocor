Exhibit P. 54	23



























P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.  We apologise for coming late.  We had to deal with a matter that -- urgent matters that have a bearing on this trial.  And before we communicate these matters to you, we would like to request the parties to introduce their teams, starting with the Prosecution.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  

The Prosecution team today is represented as follows:  Memory Maposa, appeals counsel; 
Mr. Simba Mawere, assistant trial attorney; Diana Karanja, associate legal officer; Efrem Mutashya, language assistant; we also have our two interns:  Igor Barilik, and Jamet Marion; and myself, 
Paul Ng'arua, senior trial attorney; we also have our legal officer, Mr. Elvis Bazawule.  As the Court pleases. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  The Defence team today is made up of 
Philippe Larochelle, Nathalie Leblanc; Callixte Nzabonimana; Célestin Kakango, investigator; 
Élise Le Gall, intern; and Charles Brozille, who is also an intern.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

We have two matters.  We have the oral ruling, which we reserved yesterday, as well as the schedule for this case, the proposed schedule, which we intend to communicate to you.  We will start with the oral ruling. 

The Trial Chamber observes that the alleged facilitation of reimbursement of travel and related expenses borne by Prosecution witnesses by Rwandan authorities was an issue that was not specifically covered by the pre-Defence brief or by the witness statement, dated January 11th, 2010.  The Trial Chamber further observes that this is a crucial issue that goes to the heart of not only the Defence case, but the integrity of the Office of the Prosecutor of this Tribunal.  

The Trial Chamber notes that, after initial objection by the Prosecution, lead counsel for the Defence did not pose further questions to the witness regarding this issue.  However, given that this serious allegation was raised during the examination-in-chief of the current Defence witness, for which proper notice was not given to the Prosecution, the Trial Chamber considers that the Prosecution is entitled to cross-examine the witness on this issue.  Therefore, the Trial Chamber considers that the Prosecution is entitled to time to investigate the matter and that one week constitutes sufficient time for the Prosecution to undertake this investigation.  

We shall, therefore, expect the Prosecution to complete the cross-examination of this witness by the end of this session, if not earlier, whenever they're ready with their investigations.  That is the ruling of the Trial Chamber.  

The second matter which we wanted to apprise the parties of is the provision of schedule for Nzabonimana -- for the Nzabonimana case.  You'll recall that we did ask both parties last week about the time they submit to have completed their respective cases.  And based on that and other considerations, we have come up with the following schedule:  

We propose to sit for two weeks, from 5th July to 15th July 2010.  We propose to sit for another two weeks from the 11th of October to the 22nd of October 2010.  We also propose to sit from 
the 28th of February to the 25th of March 2011.  We expect all the parties to have completed their cases by this latter date.  

Filing of closing briefs and closing arguments and delivery of judgement will be as follows:  We expect the parties to file closing briefs by the 6th of May 2011.  We will hear closing arguments on 
the 3rd of June 2011.  And we expect judgement to be delivered by the 27th of October 2011.  So that is the proposed schedule for this case.  

Any comments, Parties?  

Prosecution?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Thank you, Madam President, for giving us an opportunity to make our comments on the proposition that you've made -- on the proposal that you've made. 

The only problem I have is 5th July to 15th July 2010.  As it is, Madam President, we had, on the basis of the fact that you were going to take our break on the 4th of June, made plans and approved leave for our staff within the period -- or, up to about 15th of July.  And people have made travel arrangements, et cetera.  So if it pleases the Court, this date, between 5th July to 15th July, if it was substituted, we would be very happy to comply, Madam President.  May we suggest that this be considered?  We do not have a problem if the two weeks in October were enlarged to take account of 
the July 5th to July 15th 2010 session.  

Madam President, this comes as a bit of a surprise because of the travel arrangements and the 
leave -- you know, it also involves the leave from -- for children.  And people have made arrangements to be with their children abroad and other places.  And 5th July to 15th July appears to be really in conflict with -- with so many things that had been planned in anticipation that we were going to take a break on the 4th of June, as the Court pleases.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Madam President, Your Honours, the schedule, 11 October to 22 October suits us very well, 28th February to 25 March too, and the other dates.  In fact, as far as the Defence is concerned, it 
was -- we would rather like to have a split-up of sessions as much as possible because, from a professional standpoint, it is easier to manage those splits with your various activities in Canada or France.  

It is sure that the date of 5 to 15 July also raises difficulties for us, just as for the Prosecution team, I expect, because in our case we -- we are practicing a legal profession as lawyers in our country.  We have been away for almost two months.  Maybe with a break of one week, and I will not hide from the Tribunal that we have a lot of delays to catch up on in our various consultancies in Canada or France.  So if we have to come back from 5 to 15 July, belatedly, it would not suit any of us.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you done, Counsel?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
We -- we're trying to compute the -- the timeframe for the evidence from 11 to 22 October to see -- and I believe that the Chamber, in its wisdom, has given enough time during that session.  So we'll move slowly.  It is good to have some time left -- some preservation of time.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any response, Prosecution?  Any reply?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
None, save to say that I also support the -- the position of the Defence that everything else in the scheduling appears to be fine, except this 5th July to 15th July.  Maybe we can increase, by one week, the various other sectors (sic) -- for instance, 11th of October.  If we could start a bit earlier, probably the 1st of October, and have a run of up to 22 October, that would probably take care of our worries.  That is my suggestion.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Before we deliberate, we think we should also inform you that this calendar was taken into account -- took into account the various obligations of the Judges in other cases and, therefore -- like Munyakazi, Butare, Ngirabatware and others, all the Judges are committed in other cases through the remainder of this year.  And that is how we came up with this calendar.  The Judges also need to go on recess and to rest.  So we will -- we will now deliberate and come back to you.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Just one more thing, Madam President, I'm sorry.  I did not notice, but we would like for the filing of closing briefs -- we would like the date to be moved forward by a week, because we are the Defence, to be able to study the Prosecution brief and to reply to it, if that is possible, in our final trial brief.  

We know that we will try to file our brief in English and French, so there will be no timeframe devoted to translation for the Bench -- or for the Tribunal, which is English and French, actually, as working languages.  So the idea is that, from the standpoint of the right of the Defence and to simplify things, we will need to have an extra week to see what the Prosecution has written so as to give a meaningful 
final brief.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, what we can say for the moment is that the filing of closing briefs here is done simultaneously, and that is the practice.  And we -- and the consideration is that you have had -- you will have had sufficient time to study each others' cases by the time these closing briefs are filed.  So that is the consideration, Learned Counsel, and this is in accordance with the rules as well.  

We'll get back to the parties tomorrow.  Let's all continue to ponder this issue and we'll finalise it tomorrow.  In the meantime, we'll continue with the witness.  

Registry, could you arrange to bring the witness in court, please. 
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Sorry, we'll get back to the parties on Monday, as we're not sitting tomorrow. 
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good morning, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you feeling better this morning?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I'm feeling a bit better.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good.  We are sorry to have kept you waiting.  We had important issues to address with counsel.  And we will now proceed with your testimony.  

Prosecution Counsel.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.
JEAN MARIE VIANNEY MPORANZI, 
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	Now, I want you to tell the Court, with regard to what you were speaking yesterday, whether you knew how your two companions came to know that you had the piece of paper given to you by the investigator.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, can you hear the Trial Chamber?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, this time around I can hear you very well.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And did you hear the question put to you by learned counsel for the Prosecution?  
THE WITNESS: 
I would like the question to be repeated to me.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution Counsel.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Yes, Witness.  Now, Witness, I want you to tell this Court, with regard to what you were speaking about yesterday, whether you knew how your two companions came to know that you had the piece of paper given to you by the investigators.  
A.	Well, the interview room was close by and the witness -- witnesses who concluded their hearing would come out to relax a bit.  An investigator, who realised that those who were outside were getting impatient, informed us that there was a travel allowance available for witnesses.  That is how he included on the list the name of the witnesses who had finished their interviews, and he told us the person to whom we were supposed to hand over the piece of paper on which were written the names, and which carried the signature of the investigator.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
I'm sorry to interrupt, Prosecutor.  I believe there is a slight error in the CaseView in French.  I heard the witness say that there was travel allowance -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, maybe if there is an ambiguity in the answer or a mistake, we can ask the witness to repeat his answer.  That is better because we avoid other problems, Learned Counsel.  

Witness, could you repeat your answer because we have a problem with the CaseView in French.  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I'll gladly repeat my answer.  

The interviews were held in two rooms that were very close, one to the other, and those witnesses who completed their interviews with the two groups of investigators would go out to relax a bit.  And since it was the first time, we were wondering whether to say goodbye and leave.  And the investigator realised that the witnesses who had completed their interviews were getting impatient, so he informed us that there were allowances -- because we did not know there were travel allowances.  So -- but we had to be given travel allowances.  So he gave us a small piece of paper that he signed, and he hold us the person to whom to give the piece of paper to receive our money  and he stated that we had to go to the sous-préfet of the sous-préfecture, that is, Marguerite.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, when you finished your interview, were you one of the persons who went outside to relax, to wait for the others, or were you inside the interview room when others were waiting for you outside?  Can you clarify that to the Court, please?  
A.	I was the first to come out. 
Q.	Witness, you're telling this Court, aren't you, that when the others finished the interview, it was you who was called and informed that there were travel allowances to be taken; is that correct?  
A.	Sorry, I did not get you.  I did not quite understand the question.  
Q.	Witness, so, in fact, what you're telling the Court is that it was you who was informed by the investigators that there was a travel allowance to be taken and, therefore, you went back into the Chamber, where the interview was had, and were given the voucher to claim money; is that correct? 
A.	No.  I think there is some confusion -- there was some confusion.  After giving the signed piece of paper -- well, first, the investigator started by asking me if I knew Marguerite.  Then he told me:  "Very well.  Now the ICTR provides for travel allowances for witnesses." So since other persons had finished, he combined the names of the witnesses on a piece of paper and asked us to go to Marguerite.  So when we got to Marguerite's office, we gave -- presented the piece of paper as evidence that we had been interviewed, and Marguerite gave us the money and made us to sign off the money.  So it is Marguerite who remained with our signatures.  We did not go back to the maison des femmes, so each person went their separate way.  
Q.	Witness, you have given us a lot of detail, but I'm afraid you have not answered my question.  I just want you to clarify to the Court:  You finished first with your interview; that is correct, isn't it?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You went outside into the courtyard to relax; correct?  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	At the time when you went outside to relax, did you have the payment voucher with you that was signed by the investigator?  
A.	No, not yet.  
Q.	So you waited outside on your own volition; is that correct?  
A.	No, the investigator had asked me to wait for a while, so I waited.  He asked me to wait for a while because he had to give me the date on which I had to meet him to sign my statement.  I believe that was the reason.  The statement -- I had not signed the statement right away, so he had to tell me when I had to come back or when he would come to see me to sign my statement.  
Q.	Witness, yesterday, when we discussed the matter of payment, I asked you to tell the Court, in your own words, what instructions you got from the investigator.  Is it correct, Witness, that you made the Court believe yesterday that immediately your -- you were done with your statement, they gave you a voucher and asked you to go and collect money from Marguerite; is that correct, Witness?  
A.	That is the detail I forgot.  
Q.	But it's a very significant detail, you agree, Witness; isn't it?  
A.	It would depend on the person that is judging.  
Q.	Now, Witness, are you, therefore, telling the Court now that your two companions were informed in your presence when the sheet -- or the voucher was issued to you to go and collect money from Marguerite; is that correct?  
A.	No, that was not the case.  
Q.	Then the original question that I asked you has still not been answered:  How did you come to know how the two persons, who were your companions, knew that you had the voucher?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, before the witness answers, the witness previously called it a "note".  And now you're calling it a "voucher", and the record might be confusing.  Maybe we could stick to the language by the witness.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Yes.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	By the voucher, Witness, I mean the note that you got; is that correct?  

So, Witness, the question that is pending before you -- did you understand the question?  
A.	You have just asked me two different questions.  Which one are you referring to?  There is one question having to do with my leaving and another one on the small note written by the investigator.  
Q.	Yes, Witness, the second question was just a clarification.  The Judges wanted us to use one word.  I had used a "note" and a "voucher".  And now we're going to use the "note".  

So the previous question still stands, Witness.  Can you answer it?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Maybe, Counsel, to make progress, repeat the question to the witness so that we can move on.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, do you agree with me that you have still not explained to the Court how you came to know that your two companions knew that you had the note for payment of money?  
A.	The note was written when the investigator had just made sure that the other witnesses had gone out.  So at the same time, he informed me and the other witnesses.  He informed us together in a group.  But I was not the one who went to inform the two others.  He was the one who did coordination of the movement.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, move on.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Yes, thank you.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Now, when you got the note, you read it, didn't you?  
A.	We read it.  
Q.	To whom was it addressed?  
A.	To whom the note was addressed?  Is that your question; to who?  The note was addressed to the sous-préfet, Marguerite; the sous-préfet, Marguerite.  
Q.	Was the second name of Marguerite written on the document?  
A.	Yes, it was written, but I have forgotten the name.  I was only able to remember the first name.  
Q.	Is Marguerite a person you knew before that date?  
A.	No, I did not know her.  That is even why the investigator asked me whether I knew her.  But I had heard the name, but had not had the opportunity to look at her face to face.  
Q.	So, as far as you are concerned, you were being sent to a total stranger; that is correct, isn't it?  
A.	It is easy to go to a public building.  There are numbers written on doors.  Where you find the word "sous-préfet" written, you would knock on the door and you go in.  That is what happens in 
	public buildings. 
Q.	Please, Witness, I don't want to keep you here for long.  

I just asked you:  You were being sent to a stranger; is that correct?  I mean no disrespect; I just want you to clearly answer the question.  
A.	I knew that at the Gitarama préfecture there was a lady who was sous-préfet and who was called Marguerite.  But for me, it was easy to find the office.  
Q.	Witness, the answer is that you were being sent to a stranger; is that correct? 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Counsel, move on, we have noted the witness's answer. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Yes, Witness, when you got to the sous-préfet's office, did you also have with you, along with the piece of paper, your draft statement? 
A.	Draft statement of the interview, you mean?  The interview with the investigator?  
Q.	That is the question.  
A.	No, I did not have it because the investigator told to me -- told me -- correction -- that they were going to have it typed and have me sign it around September.  So I did not have the statement, because it was still in draft form with the investigator, and I had to sign it only later.  And that is what happened.  
Q.	Now, when you got to her office with your other two companions, did she interview you?  
A.	We showed him -- or, her the note and we wanted to make -- the person wanted to make sure that we were the witnesses that had been discussed -- or, that she had been informed about, and she asked us the distances of our locations and then she decided upon the amount that she had to give us.  
Q.	Witness, how long did that interview last? 
A.	Maybe two minutes; just the time for introductions and to hand her the note, and for her to ask us a 
	few questions about our locations, and then to give us the money.  I think it was about 45 minutes, if I'm not mistaken.  
Q.	Why does her name stick out in your mind, when you only spent with her a very short time, and that of the investigator, whom you had spent considerable time with and subsequently saw him, cannot be remembered by you?  
A.	The name was already in my mind as sous-préfet in Gitarama préfecture.  I had the name in my memory already and that is why I did not forget it.  But why I do not remember the names of the investigators is because, after the interview, as far as I was concerned, the relationship was over.  They went and came back in different groups.  That is why I did not retain their names.  There was no special relationship between us; it was purely an investigator/witness relationship.  I have no interest in remembering names which I will have to forget shortly after.  
Q.	Witness, it is Marguerite who paid you the money; is that correct?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	But she is the sous-préfet and not the cashier of the préfecture; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, she's sous-préfet.  
Q.	And there is a cashier's office within the sous-préfecture -- or, within the préfectoral office, isn't there? 
A.	Yes, but you should not mix up the two accounts:  The accounts of the ICTR and the accounts of the préfecture.  I believe that that money had been handed over to her by the investigator, to be distributed to witnesses.  But the money from the ICTR was not paid into the accounts of the préfecture.  That has to be clear.  
Q.	Witness, you are an intellectual and, above all, you are -- or, were an administrator; is that not correct?  
A.	I am an intellectual, but I am not an administrator.  
Q.	Witness, you were the bourgmestre of Rutobwe.  Is that not an administrative position?  
A.	I was in that position simply for one year and I still had a lot to learn with the years and experience.  So I was still a beginner.  But I, myself, still had a lot to learn from the personnel that were there, but the time and the circumstances did not allow me.  
Q.	But one thing that you learned was that your supervisor, who was a sous-préfet, was not the cashier and never dealt with money -- paying out money -- to people; is that not correct?  
A.	Could you please repeat the question?  
Q.	My question was:  But one thing that you learned in the one year as bourgmestre, was that your supervisor, who was a sous-préfet, was not the cashier and never dealt with money, he never paid out money to people; is that not correct?  
A.	I believe you're linking up two different steps:  The first one, when I was bourgmestre, and the situation afterwards.  The relationship between Marguerite and myself, there is some time separation.  But as far as your question is concerned, I still have the impression that you really want to mix up those 
	two accounts:  The accounts of the ICTR, and the accounts of the préfecture office.  I have simply explained that if Marguerite had been asked to pay us that money, that money was not coming from the préfecture accounts, it had come from the accounts of the ICTR.  

That is how I understand the situation.  I do not want to imagine that the ICTR had asked the préfecture to pay in its place.  
Q.	Witness, just be brief.  This is a very simple matter; very, very simple matter.  

Do you agree with me, Witness, that an international organisation cannot give money to a sous-préfecture without at least the permission of a sous-préfet; do you agree with that?  
A.	Those are administrative matters which I am not familiar with.  I do not understand all those administrative acrobatics.  So I apologise.  Between what happened between the investigators and the sous-préfet, well, I really do not know.  I did not even find it necessary to find out what happened.  What I knew and what made me happy was that I was being given some money.  So let's not complicate matters by trying to delve into administrative matters that did not concern us.  In any case, it did not concern me.  
Q.	Yes, Witness, do you remember at that time who was the préfet of Gitarama préfecture? 
A.	Please, give me some time to try to recall. 
Q.	It's all right, Witness.  When you remember, you can inform us later; okay?  

Now, Witness, when you received the money from the sous-préfet, where did you sign a receipt for the money?  
A.	In the same office, the sous-préfet's office.  
Q.	Yes.  Did you sign it on a register or did you sign it in a book, or where did you sign it?  Where did you append your signature; on what document?  
A.	I think each person signed on -- a receipt.  
Q.	And that receipt was issued to you, and another one to your two companions; is that correct? 
A.	We pocketed the money and we left.  
Q.	Yes, but a receipt is proof of payment.  It's something issued as proof of payment.  Did you receive another sheet of paper as a receipt that you had received the money?  Did you sign a document to show that you had received the money? 
A.	We signed a single document that had to remain in Marguerite's office. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Interpreter corrects:  They signed an acknowledgment of receipt, not a receipt.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Yes.  Did you sign it on the same document that had been sent with you by the investigator or did you sign on a different document?  
A.	I no longer remember.  
Q.	I'll tell you something, Witness, I've been moving (sic) this Court and informed them that the reason you're having difficulty with this very slight matter is because you are making it up as you proceed.  
A.	I do not agree with your conclusion.  It does not -- it is not based on any palpable evidence.  
Q.	Witness, by the end of this cross-examination, we shall show to you proof of document -- by document that investigators of the ICTR are not authorised to give such stipends to third persons to give to other people, and particularly witnesses.  
A.	That concerns your procedures, but on the field, that is what happened.  That is what I experienced on the field.  
Q.	By the end of this cross-examination, we'll also show you that the UNICTR has no memorandum of understanding by which the Rwandan government is enjoined to pay stipends to ICTR witnesses.  What do you say to that?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
I object.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, we request you to leave court briefly so that we can entertain legal arguments from counsel.  This is standard procedure which we have been following, and we request for your understanding. 
(Witness exited courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Very briefly, Madam President.  Are these questions?  Counsel for the Prosecution has embarked on an argument with the witness in which he tells the witness that he will bring -- provide evidence.  What should the witness say?  These are not questions.  In fact, I find that it is at a very limit.  So I'll pray the Chamber to direct the Prosecutor not to continue in that direction.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Madam Witness -- I'm sorry, Madam President -- I'm very sorry, Your Honours, counsel is not blind to the issues and the allegations that are being made by this witness and the ruling of the Court this morning in this regard.  

What we are doing now is putting our case to this gentleman for him to react.  He has already said that:  Look, with respect to that item, that's not what happened.  But we have a duty and, in fact, the Prosecutor should and must put his case to the witness.  And we know that, after this part of the cross-examination, this witness will be re-called, and we're just marking the record to show what we are going to do and confront him with.  And he'll have another time to react to it.  

So I do not think this is extraordinary.  We have already told the witness that he's not only mistaken, but he is lying, and we have made an issue out of this.  Really this part of the proceeding is almost like a trial within a trial.  We're entitled, in wrapping up this matter, to put to the witness and to clarify to him exactly what we intend to do when he's re-called back.  He does not know that he's going to be re-called, but we're putting this thing to him so that his mind is very clear, and so that if he has the conscience to do so, he can change now and tell the Court:  I'm sorry.  If that is the extent to which you people are willing to go, I am sorry, I'm changing my story.  I lied.  I'm sorry.  

So that is an opportunity that I must give him.  And the only way to give it to him is to show him that we are not taking this thing too lightly by showing him exactly what we shall do.  And if he has a sense of embarrassment, he will say:  I'm sorry; I lied.  So I think there is no merit in the objection that counsel has brought up.  It is normal procedure; he knows it; he does it; and he should not be entertained and his objection should be overruled.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
I observe that the Prosecutor attaches very importance to this issue of payment.  But the witness has already answered, and he stated that, honestly, he did not know anything about the accounting system of the Tribunal or the way the Office of the Prosecution functions with the Rwandan authorities.  He gave an honest answer.  

Now, counsel for the Prosecution has just told me that -- has told the witness that:  I'm going to demonstrate that we of the Office of the Prosecution, we do not operate this way.  Very well, the Prosecution -- counsel for the Prosecution will bring evidence from the Office of the Prosecutor, and such evidence will be tested compared to what is happening on the ground in the little préfectures in Rwanda.  But that will be the evidence of the Prosecution.  

But the Prosecutor has almost threatened the witness, whereas, the witness -- if we consider 
yesterday -- has been questioned for about one and a half hours on this same issue -- one and a half to two hours on the same issue.  And he says he knows nothing, and the Prosecutor has nothing else to tell the witness on this.  

And I return to the initial objective -- or, my objection that I started with:  The Prosecutor is not putting questions to the witness.  He's supposed to conduct a cross-examination, and this is not a cross-examination.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

The Trial Chamber will sustain the objection for the following reasons:  The Trial Chamber understands that the party is entitled to put its case to the witness in accordance with the rules governing cross-examination.  However, the Chamber considers that the -- the intended actions being put to the witness are not really the business of the witness but that of the Trial Chamber.  

Secondly, the manner in which the questions are phrased does not import the idea of a suggestion, which the case should be. 

Finally, the Trial Chamber notes that it has granted time to the Prosecution to investigate and revert to this witness when it is ready and, therefore, it should reserve these questions for that time and move on with other matters for now.  

That is the ruling of the Trial Chamber.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
As the Court pleases.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  
Could the registry bring back the witness in the meantime.  
MS. BEN SALIMO:
Yes, Madam President. 
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, you will continue with your testimony.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  

Witness, welcome back.  
A.	Thank you.  
Q.	Now, Witness, when you went back to your préfecture -- to your secteur, did you meet Gahunde, the bourgmestre of Rutobwe?  
A.	No, I did not meet him because, as a matter of fact, I had met him in the morning when he came and informed me of the arrival of the investigators.  So I did not go back to see him. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, before you continue, what timeframe are you addressing?  The question is not clear 
	because -- 
MR. NG'ARUA:
After he left the -- the -- the -- the sous-préfet's office.  I will -- I'll -- the 25th. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Maybe you could put the question to the witness so that he's very clear about the time.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
That's right.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, when you left the office of the sous-préfet, in August 1998, did you report back to Mr. Gahunde, the bourgmestre of Rutobwe?  
A.	No, I did not report back to him.  He did not ask me to do so.  
Q.	When did you next see him after 1999 -- after 1998?  I'm sorry.  
A.	Well, he was the bourgmestre and he often came to my school.  So I would meet him every week at least on the road and greet him.  My school was located close to the commune office, so we met regular -- often on different occasions at the school, games and other activities.  
Q.	Witness, did you discuss with the bourgmestre, Gahunde, the statement that you had given to the investigators of the ICTR?  
A.	No, we did not discuss that matter.  He was sure that I'd met them, but he did not offer any comments.  There were no discussions to that effect.  
Q.	And, Witness, is it correct to say that Bourgmestre Gahunde never got to know that you had omitted in your statement that Callixte had slapped you; is that correct?  
A.	I did not get the question.  
Q.	Witness, is it correct that the bourgmestre of Rutobwe never came to know that you omitted the incident that Callixte had slapped you? 
A.	He knew nothing about my statement because I told him nothing about my statement.  
Q.	Witness, on the 13th of August 2003, you made another statement to the investigators of the ICTR; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  13 August 2003.
Q.	It is correct, isn't it, Witness, that the bourgmestre of Rutobwe, Mr. Gahunde, did not force you to see the investigators and make the statement of 13th August 2003, did he?  
A.	No.  On that occasion the investigators were brought to my home by one Uwera.  So they came and I welcomed them.  But I would like to recall that each time I received investigators, Gahunde had done the groundwork of -- of compelling me to testify.  He had completed his work, so each time the witnesses came, they would find out where I lived and then they would get in contact with me through Uwera.  The second and third times it was Uwera who was asked about my living quarters, where I lived.  
Q.	Yes, Witness.  And after the statement that was taken of 13 August 2003, you did not report back to the bourgmestre and tell him what you had said, did you?  
A.	No, I was not obliged to.  He did not ask me.  He had never asked me to tell him each time I made statements.  
Q.	Yes, Witness, between the first statement -- making of the first statement of 25th August 1999, and when you -- sorry, 1998 -- and when you made your statement of 13th August 2003, did you receive any threat or intimidation from the Rwandan government?  
A.	Yes, I think so, but I do not remember the precise year.  I had trouble with a group of investigators, a group of investigators I did not want to receive.  After three days, intelligence officers came to my house to try to find out my attitude and I had a hard time explaining my reasons.  But they understood my reasons and they did not come back again to take me to prison.  

But I've answered your questions.  I was going to discuss the reasons.  
Q.	Did you tell this piece of information to the Defence counsels in your statement?  
A.	I believe I raised this issue.  
Q.	Witness, tell the Court, when Mr. Don Webster came to see you in 2007, did he threaten you?  
A.	No, he did not threaten me personally.  In fact, he was quite courteous.  But what really appeared strange to me was the summons he had with him.  It was a summons from the state prosecutor in Kigali.  The summons compelled me to appear the next day at the state prosecutor's office in Kacyiru.  But at the end of the interview, he explained to me why he, himself, took the initiative to come with a summons.  
Actually, I understood that it was a form of pressure to get me to appear.  But he was kind with me.  He did not treat me as some how (sic).  He was quite courteous, polite.  But it was his approach of passing through the state prosecutor.  You know, a simple person like myself, if I receive a summons, I will feel that the world has come to an end.  So he reassured me and said:  No, it's just that I wanted absolutely to see you.  
Q.	And he asked you to ignore the summons, isn't it?  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  So he explained to me that I was not going to appear.  Because in relation to the summons, I asked him about the 1,000-franc note that he had left with my neighbour, together with the summons, as transport money, he hesitated a bit and said:  Well, you can keep it for a bottle of Fanta.  That is all.  After that, he left.  
Q.	Not only that, Witness, but you had a very lively discussion with Mr. Webster, because he wanted to find out information from you about the meeting of the 18th April 1994 that took place in Murambi; is that not correct?  
A.	Well, a lively discussion, I don't know.  A lively discussion?  Violent threatening?  I would like to know the choice of the word.  I can't understand the meaning of that word, that adjective.  So I need help here.  
Q.	Witness -- I'll move on.  I understand you.  

During the interview, Mr. Webster was accompanied by a west African man by the name of Masamba; is that not correct?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Masamba, My Lord, is spelled M-A-S-A-M-B-A.  
THE WITNESS: 
I did not quite get the name of the person who accompanied him.  But there was a tall man, the secretary and another person.  I do not remember their names.  I remember Don Webster's name because he had informed me beforehand that he was coming, and the others were just accompanying him.  I have trouble remembering names.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, before we go to the break, is it not correct that, during the interview, you even took them around your farm and showed them how you made your coffee?  Is that not correct?  
A.	Did you say I took them around?  No, I explained that when they came, they did not find me in the house so they were waiting for me, and at the last moment I came in, just when they were about to leave.  So they had waited and waited.  They had not come to admire nature.  They had come to collect information.  
Q.	You're telling this Court, Witness, you never showed them your coffee machine and how you mill your coffee?  Is that what you're saying to this Court?  
A.	I've never had a coffee plantation.  I've never had a machine.  I've never owned an industrial enterprise or firm in my life.  So where they met me, I was renting the house and I had been there for about 
	three or four months.  So I've never been as rich as they make out.  I've always been a poor teacher, and you can always check that on the ground.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
My Lords, I think this is a good time to take the break.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel. 

Witness, we'll take the morning break.  And you're still testifying so don't discuss your evidence with anyone. 

We will resume these proceedings at 11:30, 11:30 this morning. 
(Court recessed at 1105H) 
(Pages 1 to 17 by Lisa D. Smith)
























(Court resumed at 1130H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, good morning, once again.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, once again, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are resumed, and you will continue with your testimony.  

Prosecution Counsel.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Thank you.
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Good morning, again, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Good morning, again, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	Yes.  We were just discussing Mr. Don Webster's and Masamba's meeting with you in 2007.  

Now, Witness, after the interview, did you show Mr. Webster around and get some yams for Mr. Masamba to plant at his place? 
A.	No.  I have testified that I had no plantation outside and that I was living in rented premises that had nothing in the surroundings of that house.  The house did not belong to me.  The property that surrounded the house did not belong to me.  It belonged, rather, to the family of my neighbour.  

Now, concerning the yam cuttings that the others took to go and plant, those cuttings were provided 
by my neighbour to whom the house belonged.  So we should properly situate this aspect within time and space.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And during that interview you called Mr. Don Webster aside and talked to him away from the other members of the OTP, that is, Office of the Prosecutor; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I talked to Mr. Don Webster and his secretary to my small living room and we conversed.  
Q.	That's not the question I put to you, Witness.  After the conversation with Mr. Don Webster and Mr. Masamba, what you call his secretary, you also requested Mr. Don Webster himself along to come outside and talk to you aside; is that correct? 
A.	No.  The interview ended in my living room.  I showed them off right up to the courtyard of 
	my neighbour.  I shook his hand and he went down to his vehicle, maybe a Pajero, Marque vehicle or some other comfortable vehicle that he used.  
Q.	I put it to you, Witness, that you did talk to Mr. Webster privately and you expressed to him that you were unwilling to discuss matters pertaining to the genocide, isn't that correct? 
A.	No, that is not true.  
Q.	You also told him in the private conversation you had that you were not well and that you needed 
	some help, is that not correct? 
A.	No, that is not true.  
Q.	Mr. Webster also informed you that there was help available at the ICTR clinic for your condition; is that correct? 
A.	That is not true.  
Q.	You also told him that the reason why you did not want to discuss in great detail the events of 
	18th April 1994, at Murambi, was because -- was because your illness had caused you to forget most of the details; is that correct? 
A.	That is not true.  
Q.	Witness, the so-called summons that Mr. Webster came with and your neighbour showed you was, 
	in fact, a letter introducing him to you and asking you to cooperate with him and that he was from ICTR; is that correct? 
A.	No.  It was his summons asking me to appear before the state prosecutor.  
Q.	Witness, as a former bourgmestre, a teacher and an intellectual, is there any way in which you could confuse a summons and a letter? 
A.	I remember very well that it was a summons enjoining me to appear in Kacyiru in the office of the 
	state prosecutor and that the purpose would be revealed to me upon arrival.  
Q.	Did that so-called summons include, within it, a threat that failure to come to Kacyiru, you will, therefore, be arrested or something to that effect?  Can you tell the Court.  
A.	No.  The summons was written this way, briefly.  "Mr. Jean Marie Vianney Mporanzi, you are requested to report at the office in Kacyiru."  The date was stated clearly, the next day. "The purpose of 
	your summoning will be disclosed to you upon your arrival."  Full stop.  
Q.	Thank you.
MR. NG'ARUA:
Madam President, the spelling of Kacyiru, K-A-C-Y-I-R-U.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	So, Witness, you agree with me that in the so-called summons, there was no specific threat to you, was there? 
A.	There was no -- but it was not a threat, but a form of pressure.  I took it to mean that the 
	state prosecutor wanted, by all means, to see me and did not want to come back to see me.  So it was some form of pressure that the ICTR Prosecutor wanted by using the services of the state prosecutor to come to next day to Kacyiru if he did not see me the previous day.  So the threat is not contained in the summons as such, but in the procedure -- in the approach, which I did not find quite convenient, because if he had come and not found me, he could have left a note, a simple note asking me to come and see him at some place and explaining the reason therefor.  I should have gone there to see him without bringing in the state prosecutor.  To me, I did not find it necessary.  A simple note on his part would have made me go to see him at any point he mentioned.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you met with the Defence counsel, did you discuss Don's visit to you in 2007? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, I did.  
Q.	Witness, just pause for a while.  I want to show you a document.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Madam Registrar.  

There is a document, My Lords, that I have distributed dated 19 October 2009.  I believe all parties have this document.

Mr. Registrar, if a copy -- 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, I will show you a document, but I would request you not to open it yet and we will discuss 
	one or two things before we revert to it.  

Witness, did you or did you not write a letter to the investigators of Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana and informed them that Mr. Don Webster's visit prompted you to flee the country.  Did you do that? 
A.	Effectively, I wrote a letter to the Defence of Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana because that Defence team 
	had asked me through an intermediary, whose name I cannot mention, so as to protect their security, so the Nzabonimana team had asked me to draft a letter to present to the ICTR explaining the reasons why I insisted on coming to ask the Defence to be part of its witnesses, and I mentioned the name of Don Webster.  I could not mention all the reasons in a letter because the reasons that prompted me to flee the country, I may have occasion to explain them.  I mentioned those reasons in the letter to enable the Defence to understand under what circumstances I had left the country.  
Q.	Thank you.  And in that letter, did you or did you not attribute the fleeing from Rwanda to your current country of refuge to the visit of Don Webster? 
A.	Regarding the pressure that he had used to compel me to see him the next day, just in case he had not met me, that was one of the reasons, the pressure.  There were other reasons that I have mentioned.  
Q.	Yes, Witness, but let's be very clear here.  The document that constituted the pressure for you to go into the second exile was primarily this letter from the attorney general introducing Don Webster to you, isn't it? 
A.	I did not quite understand your question.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Counsel, the witness called it a summons.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, in your letter, did you or did you not inform the Defence that the primary reason for your fleeing Rwanda was as a result of the summons that Mr. Don Webster brought along with him and he spoke to you in 2007? 
A.	I do not recall the precise words I used.  But if the letter is available, we can check its content and then 
	I will assume responsibility for it.  
Q.	We will come to that.  Take it easy, Mr. Witness.  

Now, Witness, I want you to turn to that document that is in front of you and annexed to it at page 2191, you will see a photocopied letter.  Do you see that? 
A.	Counsel, I have found the page.  
Q.	Thank you.  

	Do you -- look through it.  It is very short.  It has got three pages only.  Look through each of the pages very quickly and look at particularly page 2189, and tell me whose signature appears there.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, and while you are looking, kindly switch off your microphone.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Do you see the signature, Witness? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, it is actually my signature.  Give me some time to read the entire letter.  
Q.	Yes, Witness, you are done reading the letter? 
A.	Yes, I am done with reading the letter.  
Q.	Is that the letter that the Defence asked you through an intermediary to write? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	And is that the letter that also refers to your explanation about Mr. Don Webster's visit? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Thank you.  

Witness, I want you to turn to page 2191 and read for us the paragraphs starting with, "As I mentioned during our interview", up to the end.  
A.	I cannot find that passage.  Could you please repeat the reference so that I can find the page number.  
Q.	I will show you.  I will ask the registry to show you my copy where it is mentioned.  
A.	I do apologise.  The problem came from the word "mention", whereas in the text the word is (inaudible) or "said". 

"As I mentioned during our interview, I had to leave Rwanda in 2007 after a personal visit at my place by ICTR Prosecutor, Mr. Don Webster, who wanted to convince me to testify for the Prosecutor in Arusha.  Mr. Webster had a letter from the attorney general of Rwanda which was threatening for me.  In view of the evolution of practices in Gacaca, where all former administrative authorities are systematically receiving maximum sentences, I understood that my turn would eventually come if I was refusing the collaboration which was asked of me."  That was the end of the paragraph.  Do I continue?  
Q.	Yes.  
A.	"For these reasons, I had no choice but to flee Rwanda and absolutely refuse any contact of the Prosecutor's office in Arusha.  So I hereby confirm that I am willing to testify before the ICTR to shed light on the events that happened in the Gitarama area in 1994.  I am sending you my letter through a third party that I trust and who will be able to contact me, if necessary, if you decide that my contribution is useful for the discovery of the truth.  9 October 2009, Mporanzi Jean Marie Vianney, signature."  
Q.	Thank you.  

Now, Witness, in your examination-in-chief, you said that you went into exile in 2008.  Now, here you are telling the Defence that you went into exile in 2007.  Which of the two versions is inaccurate? 
A.	I do apologise.  The mistake is caused by some mental slip, and the date -- the year refers to the coming of Don Webster, and I actually fled the country in 2008.  But since I wrote the letter in a hurry, since the person who was supposed to convey it was in a hurry, it is a slip that just occurred.  But the truth is that I fled the country in 2008 in the month of August.  In my haste in drafting the letter for which I apologise, I also mixed up letter and summons.  But by letter, you should understand that I mean the summons that I mentioned initially.  So those are the two mistakes that I can blame on hasty drafting of the letter and I assume responsibility for that.  
Q.	Yes.  Witness, what was the hurry for you to make such a fundamental error, because it appears from reading it that Don Webster came with a threatening letter from the attorney general and you ran because Don Webster came in 2007, that was what caused you to run?  What was the hurry in drafting this letter? 
A.	That question is confusing.  
Q.	Witness, you told this Court that the Defence contacted you to produce this letter through an intermediary; correct? 
A.	Very well.  The contact was established between me and the Defence and this was done through 
	a third party.  And it is through this third party that I learned that the Defence wanted this letter, but because of the mistake that I arose from the mental slip, there is the impression that the arrival of 
	Don Webster at my place is immediately followed by my fleeing.  
Q.	Witness, for purposes of completeness of the record, I will request the registry to give you a 
	blank piece of paper and please write thereon the name of the intermediary for the Court.  It would be kept under seal.  Do you understand? 
MR. NG'ARUA:
May I request the Court to authorise the registry to do so.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, but before the witness writes.  

Is it your evidence, Witness, that you did not flee immediately after the arrival of Don Webster?  
Is that your evidence? 
THE WITNESS:
That was my testimony.  And the evidence is that in July 2008, I, once again, received a team from the ICTR.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  You may now write the name.  

Yes, the name will be placed under seal and will be part of the record as requested by learned counsel.  
(Exhibit No. P. 54 admitted, under seal)
MR. NG'ARUA:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	We shall continue, Witness, to mention this person as the intermediary; correct? 
A.	Very well.  
Q.	Now, is this intermediary somebody known to you or is he somebody introduced to you by the Defence?  
A.	He is someone that I knew and who also knew me.  
Q.	Yes.  Is he the person who introduced you to the Defence? 
A.	Yes, it is this person who led me to establish contact with the Defence.  
Q.	So can you tell this Court why is it that you were in a hurry to write this letter which was to be conveyed by the intermediary to the Defence? 
A.	It is a security problem.  I was separated by that person by a very long distance.  I cannot see where for my own security and when this person contacted the Defence, he had to travel to come and find me because he was the only one who knew my whereabouts.  He had to come quickly because he had to return before the others left.  That is how I had to write the letter in a hurry and including some mistakes, for which I apologise.  
Q.	Tell the Court, Witness, what did the intermediary tell you exactly?  In your own words, tell the Court.  
A.	Since I had asked him, as he was one of the Defence witnesses, I had expressed the desire to meet the Defence and the Defence was not willing to receive me because of ethical issues that witness was asked to come and tell me that they could not receive me and that they needed a letter.  That is what the witness told me when he came to see me in my house.  Afterwards, he went back to see the Defence and I had to wait for the response or reaction of the Defence.  
Q.	Witness, can you tell the Court at the time of writing this letter, had you already met with the Defence? 
A.	Yes, I had met the Defence in December of 2008, if my memory serves me right.  
Q.	Now, what is this ethical issue that you have said that prevented the Defence or you to contact the Defence directly?  Did you come to know? 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Objection.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, you have to leave, unfortunately.  It will take a short time and we will ask you to come back.  Could you please leave now.
(Witness exited courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
How can the witness be aware of a judicial battle that we had to fight against the Prosecutor, who was, as he told us at the time, almost certain that Jean Marie Vianney Mporanzi will come here to testify for him, and even he had to request for protective measures in January, February 2009.  The witness does not know the details of this battle, as far as I know.  I do not see the essence of that question.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecution Counsel.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Clearly, Madam President, this question is important.  He says that he is aware of ethical issues that prevented Defence from seeing him, because -- he says it is because of ethical issues.  I just want him to tell the Court what are those issues, if he knows.  If he does not know, he will move on.  But I do not see that this is an unfair question, it's something that is within his knowledge and I am not asking him or holding him to an impossibility.  If he was informed by the Defence that there is an ethical issue and they cannot continue to meet, he should say so.  Otherwise, if there is anything further, the Defence can argue it out in the appropriate forum, but not now.  This amounts to gagging a witness from saying what happened.  This is an important issue and I believe that the objection should be overruled.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Very well, if the question is asked from that angle and not with regard to the interview or not questioning the witness about the judicial battles here, there is no problem with that.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution Counsel.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Then I take it that the objection is withdrawn.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And you can take into account the observations of the Defence Counsel. 

Can we have back the witness in court, please.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam President.  
(Witness entered courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, you will continue with your testimony.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.

Witness, what was the ethical issue that prevented you from meeting with the Defence? 
A.	I do not know because the problem rather lies with the Defence.  So when I met for the first time with Defence counsel, he told me:  "For the time being, I cannot say that I can add you on my witness list.  I, first of all, have to discuss it with the team".  And then he asked me to wait for his response.  
Q.	And, Witness, are you telling this Court that in the response, he informed you that there was an ethical issue that he could not meet with you; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is what we should retain.  
Q.	When did the Defence tell you that there was an ethical issue, do you remember? 
A.	Defence counsel mentioned that when he was saying that he could not just automatically receive me 
	as one of his witnesses.  Furthermore -- or, rather, also when the investigators from the Defence had 
	to meet with the intermediary when the team asked the intermediary to ask me -- that they needed 
	a letter to show the ICTR.  I concluded that maybe there was a problem.  But, personally, I could not immediately understand why he did not want to receive me.  I understood when the ICTR sent a 
	special messenger to ask me -- to ask me what my position was. 
Q.	Witness, you have given us a lot of detail, but you have not answered my question.  You had a contact with the Defence and they responded to you and told you there was an ethical issue.  Thus, I am asking you:  When did they respond to you and tell you that there was an ethical issue?  That is all.  
A.	When he asked me to write the letter.  The messenger who gave me the information simply told me that I had to write a letter.  Actually, I was asked to send a letter to the ICTR.  I do not know -- the letter had to be sent to the ICTR, I did not know to which service.  I was not concerned, but it was sent through the intermediary.  It was still through the intermediary that I received the information and that the Defence also received information from me.  
Q.	So look at your letter.  It is dated 9th October 2009.  Are you telling this Court that it is on that date that the Defence, through the intermediary, told you that there was an ethical question that prevented them from meeting you directly? 
A.	Yes, it was on this exact date that I learned that there was a problem.  It was on this date I learned that I had to write, that there was a problem, a problem which I did not know.  
Q.	Now, Witness, a couple of details here.  How many times had you met with the Defence between December 2008 and 9th October 2009, when you were told that there was a legal or ethical issue? 
A.	Sorry?  I beg your pardon.  
Q.	Between December 2008 and 9th October 2009, how many times had you met with the Defence before they told you that there was an ethical issue that prevented them from meeting with you? 
A.	I had not met with them.  
Q.	Did you not tell the Court that you met with them in December 2008? 
A.	I understood you meant between December 2008 and October 2009.  I did not understand that.  Actually, I did not understand you well.  I thought you wanted to know whether after meeting with 
	them -- after meeting with the Defence counsel, there was another meeting before I wrote the letter was my understanding of your question but, otherwise, I met with him in December 2008. 
Q.	Yes, Witness.  And when did you become aware that the intermediary was a witness in the 
	Callixte Nzabonimana trial? 
A.	I do not recall the exact date, but it was around September 2008.  
Q.	Can you tell the Court the circumstances that you came to know about the intermediary being a witness? 
A.	Could you please repeat your question, Counsel for the Prosecution?  I apologise for wearing you out, but I have a problem with my brain -- not functioning quite normally.  It is not my fault, really.  There are times when my brain does not connect words together to make meaning out of them.  So my intention is not to tire you or to cause you any trouble.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, are you all right? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I feel a bit all right.  But when my brain is exhausted, it starts giving signs of stroke, then I start having problems of perception in my ears and in my brain.  But I don't think it is quite alarming.  But if you think that I can no longer coordinate by reflexes, my thoughts, then you will have to understand that it is the stroke that is coming when I concentrate a lot.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Are you able to continue?  We have 25 minutes to the break.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I am ready, but even the Prosecution understands my problem because I have the impression that I am putting him through a lot of trouble.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, it is your health we are more concerned with.  The Prosecutor understands your 
health condition and he is willing to repeat the question, so that should not bother you.  Just a moment.  

Witness, as you are able to continue, we will continue until the lunch break and then you'll have a rest and be better placed to continue in the afternoon.  

Prosecutor Counsel, would you kindly repeat the question.
MR. NG'ARUA:
Yes.
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, there is also water in front of you, you can feel at home.  

Yes.  My question was:  Under what circumstances did you find out that the intermediary was a 
Defence witness? 
A.	I thank you.  

	When I arrived in my country of exile, I was received by a friend of that witness.  And since the witness is a native of my commune, I felt at ease.  When he came to see me at his friend's house and I asked him if -- well, I discussed my problem with him, the desire that I had, and he told me, "Well, I have also been contacted to testify for the Defence in the trial of Callixte Nzabonimana."  That is what actually created the bond between myself and the witness, the Defence witness.  
Q.	Witness, with the Court's permission, I will ask the same paper to be brought to you and kindly write down the friend who told you that he was a witness for the Defence.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Learned Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Objection.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, can you put off your ear set, please.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
My Lords, he understands English very perfectly.  So I think it might not be useful.  So may I request that he leaves us for a few minutes as this matter is very important.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, could you ask the witness to put back on his earphones.
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam President.
(Witness exited courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
I would like the Prosecutor to clarify his question because what Mr. Mporanzi said a while ago was not the person who hosted him who said that the Defence witness who told me about the Defence witness, but it was the Defence witness who, in a conversation, revealed to him that he was a witness for the Defence.  So his question in this regard should be:  "Give me the name of the person who hosted you."  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Yes, I concur, but I don't see what is the difference.  We are asking him to write the name of that person.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, we want to understand your interest.  

Mr. Prosecutor, we want to understand your interest.  You want to find out the witness who told him that he was also going to testify in this case.  Is that the issue?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
No.  The host -- the host who informed him that he knew of a Defence witness -- sorry, of the intermediary.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
I am sorry.  But the Prosecutor has not established that Mr. Mporanzi's host knew that the 
third party -- the third person coming in was a Defence witness.  So we should not mix up things.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Sorry.  I concur.  I am asking now about the host who hosted Mr. Mporanzi in the country of refuge.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You want to find out his name, is that the case?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
That is right.  I want him to write down the name.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Can the witness be brought back in, Registry? 
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam President.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. NG'ARUA:
Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Just a moment, Counsel.  

Yes.  Sorry, Witness, these innings (sic) and outings (sic) of the courtroom are necessary, they are inconvenient, but they are necessary.  It is a required procedure.  So there is no way out of it.  You will now continue with your evidence.  

Prosecution Counsel.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Yes, Witness, I hope you have enjoyed the very short break.  Can you write on the piece of paper in front of you the name of the host in your country of refuge where you met your intermediary. 
A.	I am wondering whether I still have to sign and mention the date because I signed the first one.  
Q.	Just write next to it the word "host".  

Thank you, Witness.  
A.	I did not understand the word you mentioned.  
Q.	Yes.  The first name on that list is your intermediary; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Now, the second name is the host, your host in your country of refuge.  So write next to it, in brackets, "host".  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  

Now, Witness, when the intermediary met with you -- you have still not explained to the Court the urgency that caused you to write that letter in haste.  Can you tell us where you wrote that letter.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Objection.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, the matter of the host country of the witness might be a problem because so far we have not mentioned it in open session.  So when you say "where you were", perhaps you need to take care.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Yes.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, I do not want you to say the town or the place.  I want you to say whether it was in your house or whether it was in a hotel in the host country.  I don't need to know the town; all right?  

So for now, answer my question, the circumstances under which you say that there was insecurity and that is the cause of the haste.  Just tell us where you were when you wrote that letter.  
A.	I am sorry to disappoint you.  But for my security, I cannot provide that information.  
Q.	Yes, Witness, are you not able to tell the Court whether you were in a bus moving from one town to another, whether you were in your place of residence in the host country?  Surely, that cannot disclose identity, can it? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, we are waiting for your answer.  
THE WITNESS:
I have the impression that two things have been mixed up.  That is, as soon as I arrived in my country of asylum, the witness we are talking about came to see me.  So as soon as I arrived -- that was the first visit, then he went back to his house.  Then there is a period when the letter was written.  There is some break within those two.  When I arrived, the witness was informed by my host and he came to visit me because that was quite normal.  I have mentioned that he is a native of my commune.  

Then we discussed the issue and he went back to his house because he is not living with my host.  So at the time of the drafting of the letter almost a year had passed; so about a year.  And there the circumstances of my residence had changed.  I was no longer living with my host.  I had moved to another place.  That is why I am concerned about mentioning that new place to which I moved.  And it is in that place, that new place of residence which is different from the place of residence of the Defence witness where the letter was drafted in a hurry, quickly.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecution, we have to stop here, unfortunately, because the lunch break is approaching and we need to do some housekeeping.  So we will stop here.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
As the Court pleases.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we are taking the lunch break shortly.  You are still testifying, so do not discuss your evidence with anyone and take a good rest during this break.  So we will resume these proceedings in the afternoon and you will be informed.  

You may leave now. 
(Witness exited courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecution Counsel, we want to know where you are and where you are going.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
My Lords, I am in the host country.  And as soon as I finish the host country, I will go to matters of the statement -- two statements that the witness has given, and then I will go to Murambi and then I will put certain propositions to this witness and I will be done.  

In fact, it is very short cross-examination compared to the length of the examination-in-chief.  And we concur that we have to take this witness very gently, otherwise, it was my intention to finish this matter by close of business today.  But, by the way he is proceeding, I think it will be difficult to finish by the close of business today, but we will try.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Well, the Prosecutor told us yesterday that he will be done by 11 a.m.  Maybe we should send back 
the witness that we brought here in anticipation of the 11 a.m. testimony.  Actually, the Prosecutor told us -- gave us that information.  He did not do so to the Chamber.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, the matter is off record.  We were not aware of it.  So if there is a witness present here, we were not told and we were not aware.  That is a bit unfortunate.  

What we can say is that the witness who is in waiting should be discharged and returned to the 
safe house.  And next time this discussion should be -- the Chamber should be involved so that we can properly plan for the next witness.

Learned Counsel, we would like to urge you to finalise your cross-examination today so that we can go through the witnesses who are remaining in good time, as you know that this session closes next week.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
I will endeavour to do that.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

The proceedings are adjourned to 2:30 this afternoon.  
(Court recessed at 1301H) 
(Pages 18 to 31 by Sithembiso Moyo)











(Court resumed at 1430H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon everyone.  

The proceedings are resumed.  

Good afternoon, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You will continue with your testimony with questions from the Prosecution.  

Prosecution Counsel.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Good afternoon, Madam President, Your Honours. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
Q.	Are you feeling better now? 
A.	Yes, a little bit better.  Thank you. 
Q.	Yes.  Witness, it would be incorrect, wouldn't it, if somebody said that between you and the intermediary, there was another intermediary; is that correct? 
A.	I think that maybe you are confusing the two names I wrote on the sheet of paper sometime ago.  The first name, please take note, is the one who welcomed me, who received me and the witness who was in direct contact with the Defence. 
Q.	Yes, Witness, there was no confusion.  It would be erroneous for somebody to tell this Court that there was a series of intermediaries between the Defence and yourself; is that correct? 
A.	It's quite usual that when friends are together they talk about everything.  So when I arrived into my country of exile -- 
Q.	I have to cut you short, but I have to.  I don't mean any disrespect. I just want you to tell the Court whether there was a series of intermediaries between yourself and the Defence other than the intermediary that you have given us, please, only that? 
A.	There were no other intermediaries.  There weren't any. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, Witness, when you went to the country of refuge, why is it that you did not find it necessary to call Mr. Djibo whose number you had and tell him: "Listen, I am sorry, I lied to 
	your investigators and I wish to inform you that I no longer support the two statements that I gave you." 
A.	It was too risky for me. 
Q.	Witness, I am approaching this question because I know you are an intellectual and you have an experience in leading men.  You are a leader in Rutobwe.  So can you explain to the Court what kind of risk it would have been to you to call Djibo, the Prosecution investigator in this case and tell him:  "Look, I no longer support my two statements."  Why didn't you do that?  Can you tell the Court?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
It has been answered.  I think the Prosecutor should be requested to move on.  He said, it was too risky. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My Lords, I think now I am seeking for an explanation.  What does that mean?  I think, too risky is not an answer to this. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The question as we understand it, what risk it would have been for the witness to call Djibo?  

And Learned Counsel, we don't have the spelling of that name.
MR. NG'ARUA: 
I will provide it, My Lords. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
The question can be answered by the witness.  
THE WITNESS:
The risk I was running was that the information might be transmitted from the Tribunal to the intelligence services.  Because sometimes there was a case where a group of investigators were refused admission and I, therefore, received a visit from two people from the intelligence department who were asking me for explanations.  So that was my concern.  But I also was hoping that one day, if God gave me life, I would at any rate come here to explain -- just like you say, Counsel, I am an intellectual.  I know that intellectual honesty does have some value.  And I was intent on coming here to explain myself.  And so I was saying to myself that the part which had lost trace of me was definitely going to see me again, although I had changed position.  Nonetheless, this time around, they would be able to collect more information from me than merely through a telephone call.  I am trying to fill a gap and I also need to explain the reasons which I had used earlier.  But this was only theoretical for me because I didn't want to be unpleasantly surprised. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, I did not understand your answer.  But tell the Court, is it not true, Mr. Witness, that on the 22nd of April 2009, at about 4.47 p.m., you were using the same number that you used in Rwanda? 
A.	Did you say the 24th?  I didn't quite get the date.  24th?  
Q.	Sorry, 22nd of April 2009? 
A.	My telephone number at the time, is that what you want to know?  When I entered my country of exile, I changed my telephone number and got connected to the country's network.  But you know with a 
	sim card sometimes if you need to communicate, you can use it after insertion, but I avoided using it often because of my security. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Madam President, Djibo is spelt D-J-I-B-O.   And his full name is Moumouni Djibo.  Moumouni is M-O-U-M-O-U-N-I.  

Thank you. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Now, Witness, on the 4th -- on the 22nd of April 2009 at 4:47 p.m., Mr. Djibo made a phone call to you and spoke to you.  Is that not correct? 
A.	I no longer recall. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, which date did you say? 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
22nd of April 2009.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	And I will remind you part of what you said -- 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
I object.  Can the witness be taken out? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, can you leave the Trial Chamber.  
(Witness exited courtroom) 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The Prosecution is about to use what seems like a statement from the witness which was recorded by Djibo, which we have never received disclosure of.  So I would like maybe first, before I make my formal objection, the Prosecutor to explain in a general manner -- I see that the Prosecutor is referring to all kinds of notes and papers but that have never been disclosed to the Defence, whereas he was fully aware that that witness was coming for the Defence and he was in a very peculiar situation.  But now he directly refers to what the witness said to Djibo and we have never had the opportunity to read that -- to prepare the witness with that information and I think it is completely unfair now to take the Defence by surprise with that information.  So maybe the Prosecutor can first explain what he is using and when he is referring to -- when he is making that suggestion to the witness.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Madam President, the primary question that I have put to this witness was not objected to.  And that whether he called Djibo, whether he had a discussion with Djibo on the 22nd of April 2009 at 4:47 p.m.  My learned friend must not be deaf to that.  Now the point that he said -- his answer was that he does not remember.  So I am putting to him what he said to Djibo to see whether he remembers that.  Now that is not a statement made to the Prosecutor.  That is a conversation between him and Djibo.  As you know at that time he was a protected witness of the Prosecutor.  And what we are saying is that his explanation that he could not call Djibo and explained to him why he needed to change his coat and wear something else and withdraw his statement, was that he was under some security threat.  So clearly this is undermined by this call, which he does not remember.  So I am entitled to use memoirs that are within the Prosecutor's office under Rule 70 and put it to him that he told this and that to Djibo.  

Now this is something that the witness should have told the Defence and not the other way round. He is now a Defence witness.  There's an order that we should not talk to him after a certain period and we didn't.  So it was up to them to ask the witness and be informed as to exactly what he told Djibo.  

Now, I do not think that I am under any obligation under Rule 66 or Rule 68, to disclose that information.  And all I want to tell him is that, he told Djibo, that he was working at a school called Gashora, at the border of Rwanda and Burundi.  And that Djibo actually went there to look for him, to get from him his final word as to whether he was coming to testify for the Prosecutor or not.  So that is the context and the document that I have has his number.  And I do not think that I am compelled by any rule of the CPNR to disclose that document.  That is what I want to put to the witness and I think that it is perfectly legitimate.  And that the objection of the Defence is simply unacceptable, and it's not founded in any law or jurisprudence of this Tribunal, and should be disallowed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Defence Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The Prosecutor is trying to have it both ways here by saying that this Rule 78, protected material and that he was under no obligation to disclose it.  And now within the context of cross-examination, popping up these documents and using them for the cross-examination.  Your Honours have made very clear orders that the documents that the Prosecutor intends to use in cross-examination have to be disclosed before the cross-examination.  And I should even say that these documents should have been communicated to the Defence much earlier than 11th April 2010.  We wrote to the Prosecutor 
	and we requested to be allowed to inspect all the documents which he had pertaining to the 
	Defence witness and which may eventually be used in their cross-examination.  And we are, for the first time today, while we are half way -- approximately half way through the cross-examination of that witness, we have; what if someone says that this witness said A, B, C, that's a statement of the Defence witness.  My objection now goes even further now that I know the nature of the material that the Prosecutor intends to use.  And I would request Your Honours to prohibit the Prosecutor from using that document which the Defence has never been able to consult and never been given the opportunity to ask the witness about and to prepare the witness for his examination and cross-examination with.  And I will -- I have precedent in Bizimungu, the Prosecutor -- this Prosecutor did exactly the same thing.  He used immigration records during the cross-examination of a witness which had never been disclosed to the Prosecutor -- to the Defence prior to their use in the middle of the examination and I can circulate that decision and the -- what the Chamber did is that they excluded all the portion of the cross-examination dealing with that document and the document itself.  And this is why it is important that the Prosecutor instead of hiding his cards and preparing ambushes and traps for the witnesses, play it again frankly and openly and before embarking on the cross-examination of a witness, disclose everything and even earlier than that.  Now he had to allow the Defence to consult their documents and to see it.  I can prepare copies of the letter which we sent on 11th April which was a follow-up on another email of 24th February 2010.  And the reason why I sent this correspondence is that I was fully aware that we needed to notify the Prosecutor, that we wanted to inspect everything he had.  And I see with great confirmation that this has never been done and that the Prosecution is trying to circumvent the very well established rule of the Tribunal. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My Lords, before you rule, I would like the Chamber to have a look at the document and especially the date of that document.  And I will also give the Defence a copy of that document and then I will leave it to the Chamber.  The Chamber will see that what the counsel is saying is completely baseless, and it's not the same issue that arose in Bizimungu case where we sought to use material that was used by 
	the -- had been given by the witness to the immigration officers.  

Now that was a statement because that was a statement of the -- a signed statement of the witness.  This Chamber has said an unsigned document of that nature is not a statement.  

So with the permission of the Chamber may registry assist? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The chamber will deliberate and give a ruling.  

This is the ruling of the Trial Chamber, and it is overruling the objection for the following reasons:  The document under review does not constitute a witness statement within the meaning of -- within the meaning assigned to a statement by the jurisprudence of this Tribunal.  It's a document under Rule 70.  

Secondly; the witness has said he doesn't remember.  His memory can be refreshed and then we can get his answer and move on.  

Thirdly; we also wish to recall that this is a Defence witness and not a Prosecution witness.  So for those reasons we overrule the objection and we will allow counsel for the Prosecution to put this question to the witness.  

Could the witness be brought back, please? 
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes, Madam President.  
(Witness entered courtroom)
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Madam President, I am most obliged -- most respectful.  We will still require a copy of that document.  If the Prosecutor is making suggestions that are based on that document, and reading rapidly from it, we think the manner in which he is proposing stuff arising from that document is not completely proper.  

And there's also information which we think is very disturbing, where it is mentioned in that e-mail that as of April 2009, the Prosecutor was aware that this witness did not want to see them and did not want anything to do with them.  I think when we think of the representations that were made by the Prosecutor after that date relating to that witness, we would request a copy of that document to make submissions on it and certainly to assess whether the propositions that will be made by the Prosecutor to the witness can effectively be -- be as he intends to do so.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, this matter will be dealt with later.  Let's proceed because the witness is in Court and we cannot discuss this matter further.

So we will proceed with the testimony of the witness and revert to it afterwards.  

Prosecution, you may continue.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Can you hear me, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Yes, I can hear you, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
Q.	And, Mr. Djibo spoke to you on the 22nd of April 2009 at 4:47 p.m.  You told him that you could meet him on the 27th of April 2009, at 10 a.m., at a primary school called Gashora in Bugesera. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Gashora, My Lords, is G-A-S-H-O-R-A; and Bugesera is B-U-G-E-S-E-R-A. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, does that refresh your mind about that conversation? 
A.	As far as I am concerned, that telephone communication is not a certainty in my mind, unless I have a recording of my voice, I wouldn't be able to believe in it.  Because between the date of my arrival in my country of exile and the date you claim to be of the communication between myself and this gentleman, normally, in rules of telecommunications, if you arrive, you have to remove your Sim Card, and if 
	five months go by and you don't use it, the number is deleted from the computers.  So for me to be absolutely sure and certain about the existence of that communication, it would be necessary for that communication to have been registered and recorded, otherwise I won't believe in it. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  

	Now, Witness, you say that there were no other intermediaries between yourself and the Defence.  When the intermediary came to you, did you give him the letter directly or did you give it to somebody else to take to the Defence? 
A.	I clearly explained that the person who was the intermediary between myself and the Defence was separated by several kilometres from me, and he came to my residence to tell me that that letter 
	was required.  I wrote the letter and gave it to him.  He went with the letter.  So when you talk about intermediaries, I do not know how many intermediaries you are referring to.  I only mentioned 
	one intermediary between myself and the Defence, not several intermediaries.  So I keep getting this confusion that maybe has to be cleared. 
Q.	Okay, Witness, I think it is pretty clear.  Now, Witness, over and above the things you have told this Court, it is correct, isn't it, Witness, that you have come here today, among other things, to inform this Court that you lied and misled the Prosecutor in 2000 -- in 1998; is that correct? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, we are waiting for your answer.  
THE WITNESS:
I am sorry; I forgot the question. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA: 
Q.	I will repeat it, Mr. Witness.  And if you feel tired or you feel that you are getting a stroke, please, let the Chamber know, all right.

My question was this, "Okay, I think it is pretty clear now, Witness, over and above the things that you have told the Court, it is correct, isn't it, that you have come here to tell the Court, among other things, that you lied to the Prosecution in your statement of 1998; is that correct?"  
A.	That I had lied from which date to which date? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, the Prosecutor is referring to your statement of 1998 to the Prosecutor.  Did you lie to the Prosecution in that statement you made in 1998?  That is the question.  
THE WITNESS:
In the statement there are no doubt, some elements which cannot be taken as lies.  But there are also some elements which are total lies.  For example, when I say that I know Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana, that is true.  When I talk about him, I am talking about someone that I know very well.  But when I talk about the allegations levelled against Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana, that is a lie.  And when I report that he said X or Y, or that he behaves in a certain manner, all those are lies as well -- that is -- those are lies on my part. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, Witness, it is correct, isn't it, that you lied in that statement knowing fully well that that statement could be used in this Court, in charges against Callixte Nzabonimana in a case involving genocide; is that correct? 
A.	No, because in my plans I was thinking that if I had the opportunity I could free myself of those lies. 
Q.	But listen to my question, Witness.  It's not -- the Judges are not just listening to polemics, they are listening to facts.  Listen to the question.  When you gave that statement, you knew or had reason to know that it would be used against Callixte Nzabonimana in a case involving genocide; yes or no? 
A.	Used by the Tribunal but not by me. 
Q.	Is your answer yes or no?  I think it is something you can say, yes or no. 
A.	Actually, I find the question confusing.  Maybe I am beginning to have problems.  There are some discussions, I do not quite understand it.  When you say; "used"; by whom?  When?  Which period are you referring to?  I am somewhat disturbed by that. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Madam President, may I request the witness to leave for a few minutes. 
(Witness exited courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Madam Witness I request the witness to -- sorry.  Madam President, I think that there's no doubt in my mind now that the time allocated to me with respect to this witness may need to be elongated.  My Lords, the witness is obviously obstructing the proceedings by refusing to answer simple questions or, he is not well.  Either way, My Lords, there's need either for the witness to take a short break and then come back or that the Chamber asks him to answer the questions directly.  Because the subsidiary questions that he is asking, really, coming from a man of his understanding, education and status, can only be interpreted as interrupting.  So I think that there's a need here, and I do this in utmost respect, and I asked him to leave because of -- so that his dignity is not affronted in the face of the Court.  But obviously, if this is the way we are going to proceed, it's going to take a very long time and I may not be able to meet the deadline that has been set by the Court.

Now, the witness was asked a very simple question whether he knew that the information he was giving the Prosecutor was to be used, and he seems not to understand that question.  He subsequently has said elsewhere that he would be willing to come to court and testify against Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana.  He seems to have forgotten that.  So probably, he has a problem, health wise or he is obstructing the proceedings.  
As the Court pleases. 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
May I?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Briefly please.   
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
The Trial Chamber would recall that the Defence had informed the Prosecutor and the Trial Chamber that this witness had health problems.  So, I believe that this witness had been testifying for 
	several days, and I do not think that he would tell you directly that he is no longer in a state to testify, but I have been looking at him, physically, he seems to be having some lapses.  I think the witness is simply tired even though he doesn't want to say so.  And he doesn't -- he can't say, we should stop.  And that is why from the onset we proposed to the Prosecutor that we only deal with this witness in the mornings.  And the witness has been working for two complete days.  Two total days of hearing and an additional day.  So I think the matter here is simply that he is tired, Madam President, Your Honours.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Very briefly, My Lords.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.   
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My observation is that, he is getting breaks and, of course, he has not been working two days in a row, sitting here.  He has been going home and sleep.  But the crux of the matter is that when he was going through the same exercises for the Defence in-chief, I was very impressed.  He didn't have any lapses, he didn't have any problems, but in cross-examination, when you ask him a simple question as to what was the purport of the statement, he seems to suddenly say that he is getting a stroke or that he is tired or asking questions that he seems to understand the -- the -- what is happening here, by trying to make this look like a school debate, where you can ask questions and ask others to confuse people and delay matters.  So, I think that more than health, I think he is obstructing the proceedings. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, could we have back, the witness in Court, please.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes, Madam President. 
(Witness entered courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, can you hear the Trial Chamber?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Madam President. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, how do you feel now, Witness?  Are you ready to proceed, because if you are not, we would like to make a suggestion.  We could have a short break to allow you to recoup your energy and resume, and then have another short break before the end of the day.  So, how -- how -- what is the state of your health at this moment?  How do you feel?  
THE WITNESS:
I am tired, but what tires me might require energy at the level of my memory.  If counsel for Prosecution, in order not to tire me, could ask questions using simple and precise words that could help me, after the break, then I could see whether I can recoup some energy, take a rest before we resume.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  

Yes, Witness, we will give you a short break to allow you to recoup your energy, and we will resume these proceedings in about 20 minutes.  So you may leave now and you will be informed as to when these proceedings will resume.  

You may leave the Chamber now.  
(Witness exited courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This is what the Trial Chamber has to say about the submissions made by the parties.  The 
Trial Chamber would like to reiterate that it relies on medical reports issued by the medical unit of the Tribunal for any medical condition of any person -- for verification of any medical condition.  However, to meet the concerns of the parties that the witness maybe fatigued or tired or whatever it is, we have introduced these short breaks and we hope that they will enable the witness to rest sufficiently and to testify lucidly.  We will observe the situation as we go along, and should any matter arise, we will address it as and when it arises.  That is the ruling of the Trial Chamber.  

Yes, we would also like to urge the Prosecution to make an effort to put very simple and 
direct questions to the witness to simplify everybody's work.  

The proceedings are now adjourned to a quarter to four, a quarter to four.  
(Court recessed at 1530H)
(Pages 32 to 41 by Judith Kapatamoyo)





(Court resumed at 1545H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
The proceedings are resumed.  

Witness, good afternoon, once again.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good afternoon, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we hope that you are in a better position to proceed now.  Is that the case? 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, Madam President.  The ringing in my ears has gone down. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Well, thank God for that.  

Prosecution Counsel? 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, in your statement to the Prosecutor of August 1998,  when you made that statement, did you know that the Prosecutor would use it in this trial against Callixte Nzabonimana, which is a genocide trial? 
A.	Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution, I was very aware of that. 
Q.	Witness, I want to show you your statement with the assistance of the Registry, please.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
May I request the Registry to give the witness tab number 2, which is his statement of 
25th of August 1998, the French copy.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Registry, are you done? 
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Thank you, Counsel.  You may continue.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
I am referring to tab number 2 in the folder. 

BY MR. NG'ARUA: 
Q.	Witness, the document before you, dated 25th of August 1998; do you have it before you? 
A.	I'm sorry, Counsel for the Prosecution, my copy here is in English.  
Q.	Yes, tab number 2 is in French. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, do you have the right statement, the statement in the right language for you? 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I had a small confusion with the statements here.  Yes, I do have the document.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Counsel, you may continue. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Yes.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, does your signature appear on the first page of that document? 
A.	Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
Q.	Now, turn to page 5 of that document and you can please yourself by going through it page by page and confirming whether the statements -- whether the signatures are yours. 
A.	I have my signature on the first page and on the last page.  As for the other pages, I wonder what I'm going to do about them.  
Q.	Witness, you have your signatures on each of the pages; is that correct? 
A.	No, Counsel for the Prosecution, I don't.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
May I request registry to give me those documents and let me see.  I think the English and French have been mixed on -- we will give him another copy.  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, this copy is fine, thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution.  And I have a signature on each of the pages. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Yes.  Now turn to page number 5 which bears a K number K0058821.  And there is an attestation there.  Do you see the attestation?  On that page you have signed twice; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Can you kindly read to the Chamber the attestation to which you attested your signature on the 
24th of September 1998? 
A.	"Witness attestation:  I have fully read the present statement.  It is correct and complete to the best of my knowledge and recall.  I made it voluntarily and without any promise or threats.  I know that my statement can be used in legal proceedings before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and that I might be called to testify in public, before, first, the Trial Chamber of the Tribunal or before its Appeals Chamber.  I understand also that any false testimony may bring about legal proceedings against me before the same Tribunal."  

There's my signature, which is the 24th of September 1998.  And the whole statement is
 5 pages long.  
Q.	Yes, Witness, so you knew that this statement could be used in proceedings against Callixte Nzabonimana; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution, I knew that. 
Q.	And what you have told this Court yesterday, and what you've read here that you attested to on the 24th of September 1998, discloses that, again, you told a lie; is that correct? 
A.	You are asking me whether what I stated here in comparison to what? 
Q.	Okay, Witness.  Yesterday, you told the Chamber -- you told the Chamber that when you made this statement it was made under coercion.  Now, when you signed the attestation you say that it was not under coercion; is that correct? 
A.	That is not correct.  We need to understand coercion from the side of the regime, through the administration,  but on the side of the investigators there was no coercion.  

So, coercion was from the side of the regime that had compelled me to collaborate in confirming the false test -- in making this false testimony.  But this should not be transferred to the investigators.  So when I signed on the last page, this is what I signed.  The signature should be limited to this.  And this says that there is no threat as far as this team and the investigators that I met are concerned, the investigators I met at the maison des femmes or women's house.  I believe I have explained the situation. 
Q.	So, what you're telling the Chamber is that, since you were not coerced by the investigators of the Tribunal, that is why you say that the information you had given them had not been as a result of coercion; is that correct?  
A.	Correct.  No, no.  As for the attitude and behaviour of the investigators, it is positive; there is no threat.  But as for the contents, the contents of the statement arises from coercion, which I felt in order to be able to express or state these lies.  I do not know if I am expressing myself well or if you are understanding what I'm trying to say. 
Q.	Witness, as an intellectual and a former leader of men, you knew very well that you were under no obligation to sign that attestation; isn't it? 
A.	I signed it, as I explained.  I signed it in the manner in which I explained.  It should be understood that the investigators did not force me to do so, but I had been made to get involved, by force, in this false testimony preparation.  So I consider that coercion lies on the side of the regime and not with the investigators.  
Q.	That we understand, Witness.  The point here is this:  You were under no obligation from the Kigali government or the local administration or any other authority to sign that attestation, were you? 
A.	I had to sign it because I had given a statement which had to end with a signature.  I must admit that I found myself in a situation beyond my control, where I had to absolutely lie to save my skin; that is all. 
Q.	Witness, you have told that to us more than ten times.  The point is this:  After telling the lies you are not forced or under any obligation, either from the secret police in Kigali or the administration, to sign that attestation; were you? 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The witness has answered.  I think the Prosecutor should be requested to move on now.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we have an answer here which says -- which reads:  "I had to sign it because I had given a statement which had to end with a signature".  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Yes.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, on that page, your statement ends in two signatures; doesn't it? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	And all I'm asking you is that you were not under any obligation to put both signatures on that page.  One would have sufficed; isn't it? 
A.	On the form there were two places where I had to sign. Those places were pointed out to me, and I signed.  So I simply filled the form as I was being requested to do. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, Witness, a full month had passed from the time you actually made that statement - or, gave that statement to the investigators to the time when you signed this attestation; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, a few months had gone by. 
Q.	And, Witness, your conscience did not brother you with respect to having to sign that statement one month later; is that correct? 
A.	That did not depend upon my will -- I'm talking about the time interval -- it had to do with technical difficulties on the side of the investigators.  If they had finished on that same day, I would have signed on that same day.  But they had to wait and have the testimony typed for me to be able to sign afterwards.  
Q.	But, that is not the answer to my question.  My question was that:  During that one month, between the time you made the signature -- between the time you made the statement on 25th of August 1998, to the time you signed to the attestation of that statement, your conscience had not bothered you, had it, with respect to this? 
A.	No, that did not disturb me from sleeping because I had undertaken to accept the coercion that had been imposed upon me.  What I was hoping was that the arrest of Mr. Nzabonimana, Callixte was going to take some time or would not take place at all.  So to save time, I was going -- I was going to take the time to see what I could do with my conscience.  However, during that - those
 months -- during that one month my conscience was not disturbed because I thought that 
`	Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana will not be arrested or that his arrest would take a lot of time, because I knew where I had left him in the Congo.  
Q.	So, it was only after Callixte Nzabonimana was arrested that your conscience pricked you and you fled to your current place of refuge; is that correct? 
A.	I do not agree with you.  I was convinced that he would not be arrested.  So, right up to 2007, when I was certain that the American government had committed $US5 million -- or, had promised this amount for anyone who would provide information for the arrest of Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana, it is at that time that I started having problems with my conscience.  I was eaten up with regret because I was telling myself.  Nobody jokes with dollars, and he would certainly be betrayed -- betrayed. 
Q.	Witness, my question is still not answered by you.  My question was:  It's only after the arrest of Callixte Nzabonimana that your conscience was pricked and caused you to flee to your country of refuge; is that correct or not?  I didn't ask you about US dollars.  I asked you about your conscience. 
A.	That is not correct, because once I started getting troubled by my conscience in 2007, because I had exposed the person of Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana, physically and morally, I had those regrets, and my conscience told me that I had to absolutely remedy the damage I had caused to 
Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana by taking a brave decision to withdraw the statements that I had made.  

It took me some time to reflect on all these and take a decision to leave the country.  After reflecting, I realised that it was not possible to withdraw my statements without risking imprisonment.  So, I decided to flee, but I needed to take some time to prepare myself.  

When I had taken the decision, I was delayed by the Gacaca courts.  Six persons had solicited my testimonies in those courts, most of whom were my former employees who I did not want to abandon.  I did not want to abandon them in a cowardly manner.  So, I decided to postpone my decision.  But because I waited a bit also depended on the fact that I was telling myself that for as long as he had not yet been arrested, maybe it was not urgent for me to implement my decision.  But when he was arrested, I believe in February, February 2008, I then had to leave.  But, the number of trials that were being postponed were increasing, and because of that, at the time when Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana was arrested, I still had to defend three people before the Gacaca courts.  That is why I stayed right up to July when, again, I received a visit -- I was visited one last time by the investigators from the ICTR.  

So when the last trial took place, I had -- I was now free to implement my decision.  So, I then -- I took the decision before, in 2007, but I implemented the decision in 2008 for the reasons I have just stated.  

MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Witness, we would like to remind you to be brief and direct in answering questions put to you so that we can move forward with your testimony.  Can you try that, Witness? 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I shall try.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Counsel, you may continue.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, your fleeing Rwanda for your current place of refuge was, therefore, a calculated and well-thought-out plan by yourself, rather than as a result of a hot chase by the Rwandan authorities; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution.  I must say that right up to the time when I left Rwanda, no one was after me.  I had never been in prison.  So, up to the 12th of August I crossed the border.  When I went to testify before the Gacaca court, there was no case against me. 
Q.	Yes.  Indeed, Witness, you testified in the Gacaca courts against the state; is that not correct?  You were a defence witness.  
A.	Yes, I was a defence witness.  
Q.	And after testifying as a defence witness, in a case in which the accused was acquitted, there were no consequences against you from the Rwandan authorities; is that correct? 
A.	I decided to leave.  There was no problem.  I gave general information in my capacity as 
former bourgmestre.  
Q.	And the bourgmestre of Ruhango did not cause any trouble for you; did he? 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Ruhango?  I think that needs to be corrected.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Sorry, Rutobwe.  Thank you, My Learned Friend.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Yes, Witness.  

Counsel, switch off your mike.  

Did the bourgmestre of -- 
THE WITNESS: 
The bourgmestre, Charles Gahunde, did not pose any problem for me.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The last part of the witness's answer was not heard.  His microphone was off already.  

BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Yes.  Can you, please, repeat your whole answer so that it can be translated?  
A.	The bourgmestre, Gahunde, did not pose any problem to me with my testimonies in the Gacaca courts.  
Q.	Can you kindly tell this Court to which Gacaca case did you testify for the defence, in which the accused was acquitted?  What was the name of that case and in which Gacaca court? 
A.	Please, give me a moment to try to remember.  I will not take a long time.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes -- 
THE WITNESS: 
I remember.  I have rewound the tape.  Cyubi is C-Y-U-B-I, Jandali cellule, we also have that on the first page of my personal identification sheet.  You can read Jandali, Cyubi.  I testified there for two persons:  The first person was Kamanzi, Ildephonse, who was conseiller of the Cyubi secteur at the time when I used to be the head of the commune.  

I also testified in the same cellule, for Mr. Balihuta, Pascal.  Balihuta, I shall spell that name, B-A-L-I-H-U-T-A.  Balihuta, Pascal, who was also from the same secteur, and was a trader in the Gitarama trading centre.  

In the Giko secteur I testified for my former brigadier.  And I knew it was Giko secteur, I don't remember the cellule.  It was at the cellule office in Giko.  Giko, I believe, has been recorded before.  It is not the first time we are talking about Giko secteur.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, what is the name of the brigadier? 
THE WITNESS: 
The name of the brigadier is Nkezabera, Nicodème.  Nkezabera, we shall have to spell.  N-K-E-Z-A-B-E-R-A, Nkezabera, Nicodème.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Witness.  

Mr. Prosecutor. 
THE WITNESS: 
I am not done yet. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says the witness. 
THE WITNESS: 
I am not done. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Sorry.  
THE WITNESS: 
In the Ntonde secteur, Ntonde cellule.  I believe you also have the name Ntonde.  I testified for my former policeman, Shandaba, Joseph.  S-H-A-N-D-A -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Witness did not finish spelling the name, I believe.  
THE WITNESS: 
I also testified for someone working in the -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Madam President, could the witness please repeat the answer?  We missed the name of the locality.  

He's spelling another name. 
THE WITNESS: 
B-A-N-T-E-G-E-Y-E, Boniface.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, sorry to interrupt you, but we didn't get the full name of Joseph.  We had Shandaba, but the spelling doesn't bear that out.  What was his name?  

Then you talked about someone working in a certain place.  We didn't get the place, but you have spelt the name of the person.  

So, if you could help us with those two issues.  

What was the name of your former policeman?  Was it Shanda or -- 
THE WITNESS: 
Shandaba, Joseph.  Shandaba, Joseph. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
You did not spell it out in full.  You stopped at Shanda.  If you could re-spell that one, please.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you.  S-H-A-N-D-A-B-A, Shandaba.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Now, Bantegeye, where did he work? 
THE WITNESS: 
At the Rutobwe district court -- a court at the district level in the commune.  And in Gatovu secteur I, again, testified for my former brigadier in a case which was different from the first.  So, the two areas are different; Gatovu and Giko.  And the brigadier's name is the same, but the secteur was Gatovu, which is spelt G-A-T-O-V-U. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Are you done, Witness? 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, and how are you faring?  How do you feel? 
THE WITNESS: 
I still have some energy; I believe we can continue for a little bit.  So if the buzzing in my ears comes back again, I will inform you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Okay, thank you, Witness.  

Now, Mr. Prosecutor, the witness appears to have some papers in front of him.  They may be a distraction.  So if you could, deal with them and finalise them, or withdraw them and give them back later.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, can you just put aside the papers that I've requested the registrar to give to you.  Just put it to the far side of your bench -- of your desk.  

Witness, you also testified in the case of Damascène Ndayisaba.  Ndayisaba is N-D-A-Y-I-S-A-B-A.  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  But that was at another level, another legal level.  But it is, indeed, correct.  You're quite right. 
Q.	And this person was a former communal chairman of MDR; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that's correct, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	And after testifying in his case this person was acquitted; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution.  He was acquitted but I don't know whether it was from my testimony. 
Q.	Yes, however, Witness, it is correct, isn't it, that in all these testimonies you testified for these persons charged with having taken part in the events of 1994, you were not reprimanded by the authorities; is that correct? 
A.	In fact, I was not reprimanded but it must also be noted that these cases or trials were happening at different levels.  And in the case of Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana, my lies were quite limited. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Witness, we noticed that the name of Ndayisaba is not properly spelt.  If you could, assist us with the spelling, Ndayisaba, Damascène.  

BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness -- 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
May I assist, Madam President? 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.
MR. NG'ARUA: 
N-D-A-Y-I-S-A-B-A, Ndayisaba.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, thank you, Counsel.  You may continue.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Now, Witness, I want you to briefly turn back to your statement of 1998.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Registry, could you give him his statement in French? 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Now, I want you to read to the Court -- in the English text it will be at page 3, paragraph 3; in the French language, I believe, it will be page 3.  Do you see a line starting by saying, "As he travelled, Callixte Nzabonimana offered beer to the people at Gakondokondo?"  Do you see that, at about line 15? 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Counsel, switch off your microphone as you consult, please. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	It will be at page 3, at about line 15.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, have you identified the portion you have been requested to read? 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I have found it.  

"On his way, Callixte Nzabonimana offered beer to people at the Gakondokondo centre, in Cyubi secteur, and spoke of the current policy which was to get rid of the Tutsis.  The highlights of his sensitisation campaign are between the 10 and 12th of April 1994 in the various centres in Rutobwe.  He, therefore, intensified his campaign in this area because he knew that it was calm.  At the same time, I organised meetings to warn the local inhabitants about the intoxication campaign, but they aligned themselves, eventually, to the side of Minister Callixte Nzabonimana.  Visibly, there was an open war declared between the two of us.  He was saying that I was an -- he said to the peasants that I was a teacher without experience in politics, and he had the benefit of several years of political experience.  He -- in reference to the revolution of 1959, which began in Nyabikenke, his commune, Callixte Nzabonimana was relying on this argument to convince the people to finish, once and for all, with the Tutsis.  With these arguments taking their source from the past, he succeeded in what he wanted to do.  And, thus, I asked to the -- I asked the Tutsis of the commune to hide -- to go to hide in Kabgayi, Gitarama, because I was completely overwhelmed, having only eight policemen at my disposal in the commune.  Wherever he went, Callixte Nzabonimana assured people that
 he -- that there would be no unfortunate consequences for persons who had worked "in", inverted commas, "in" the meaning that he had advised.  He was always escorted by soldiers and he, himself, was frequently dressed in military attire."  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
And that was a free translation, Madam President, because we don't have the English copy. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Registry, we gave copies -- three sets to the booth.  Can you, please, maybe assist us because it will make the work of the interpreters easier.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Madam President, we did receive a file for all the three booths, but the copy that I have only has a French.  

My colleagues in the other booths are confirming the same.  There's no English in the files that we received earlier today.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, take note of the interpreter's request. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Yes. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, the passage that you've given, can you point out to the Court which are your lies and which are Gahunde's lies? 
A.	I'm sorry, I would like to recall that -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Counsel, your microphone is on and we can't hear the witness properly.  So, let's have one microphone on.  

Witness, can you switch on your microphone and start answering the question. 
THE WITNESS:
There's something that I wanted to specify, and that is that Gahunde did not lie, so all he did is to collect information here and there from people, and what he did was, in fact, to take them on face value and ask me to confirm them and dress them up, as it were.  So I cannot -- one cannot attribute the lies to Mr. Gahunde.  He carried out investigations, he collected information, so it's not he who did the inventing.  So it's not true when you say Gahunde had spoken untruths.  So let me continue reading, if I may.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Just pause there.  

Yes, Witness, can you point out in that paragraph of information that you've read, the information given to you by Gahunde, which you know to be lies, and the information which you have put there by your own lies? 
A.	"As he travelled, Callixte Nzabonimana offered beer to the people at Gakondokondo centre in Cyubi secteur."  That piece of information was collected by Bourgmestre Gahunde.  

And the part which comes next:  "And spoke about the new policy which was to get rid of the Tutsis."  That is my own lie.  

"His sensitisation campaign hit its peak sometime between 10 and 12 April 1994."  So that is my statement.  

"In the various centres of Rutobwe."  That is still my lie.  

"He thus intensified his campaign in this zone because he knew it was calm."  That is from me; once again, a lie.  

"At the same time, I held meetings to warn the peasant farmers of his brainwashing campaign."  It is not at the same time, but it is true that when the first victim -- that the first Tutsi victim of the genocide fell in Gatovu secteur, it is true that, upon the advice of Father Gigi, I organised small pacification meetings after that incident.  So it was a lie in so far as I was transposing what had happened later and I make it happen early -- earlier than it actually did.  

"But in the end they sided with Minister Callixte Nzabonimana."  That is a lie on my part.  

"It was obviously open war between the two of us." Once again, a lie on my part.  

"He told the peasants that I was a teacher with no experience in politics, while he had several years of political experience under his belt."  Once again, these are sentiments and words that I'm putting in his mouth.  

"He made reference to the revolution of 1959, which began in Nyabikenke, his home commune.  Callixte Nzabonimana used that argument to persuade the people to finish off the Tutsis once and for all."  That is my invention.  

"By using arguments rooted in the past he succeeded in whatever he did."  That is, once again, my lie.  

"Thus, I told the Tutsis in the commune to go hide in Kabgayi, Gitarama."  That is true.  It is true that when I came back from the Murambi meeting on the 18th, in agreement with Father Gigi, we proceeded with the evacuation of Tutsis.  But when you read this, it gives the impression that after the 12th of April, Tutsis were warned to leave.  So it wasn't around that date it;  was, rather, on the 19th, 20th or 21st, because with only eight communal policemen -- police officers at my disposal, I was overwhelmed.  It is true, that after the meeting -- after we came back from the Murambi meeting, I'm taking the Murambi meeting as a point of reference, a temporal point of reference, so it is true that after I was overwhelmed, yes that is true, with only eight communal police officers at my disposal.  So, that is something which was, indeed, true, but I was not overwhelmed between the 10th and the 12th.  I was still in control of the situation.  I could punish, I could arrest people, and use my authority fully.

1700H
THE WITNESS (continued):
"Wherever he went, Callixte Nzabonimana assured the people that there would be no negative consequences for those who worked in the sense that he meant."  So this, again, are words that I am putting in the mouth of Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana in order to dress up the allegations.  "He was always escorted by soldiers and frequently wore a military uniform himself."  That is also a lie and beefing up of reality on my part.  I believe 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone; the witness's microphone was switched off before he completed that sentence, 
Madam President.
BY MR. NG'ARUA: 
Q.	Can you complete your last sentence?  It was not heard because your microphone was off.  
A.	The last sentence is:  "He was always escorted by soldiers and frequently wore a military uniform himself.  So that was a lie on my part." 
Q.	So, Witness, is it correct that over and above the pressure that was brought to bear upon you to tell lies with respect to Callixte Nzabonimana, inciting the people, threatening to attack you and releasing the prisoners, you were carried away, and on your own volition, went further than the instructions of Gahunde and gave these lies; is that correct?  
A.	No, I didn't go further because Mr. Gahunde had told me and I have here allegations.  So you are going to help me to place them in time and space but, more specifically, you as a witness (sic) and an intellectual, you must find arguments which must be convincing and which could hold before the ICTR.  So I am going beyond the instructions given in terms of the fabrication. 
Q.	Witness, how would it have helped your statement to say that "Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana was escorted by soldiers and frequently wore a military uniform himself"? 
A.	I think that I put that in without too much reflection on the impact.  But I wanted to amplify the fact that Callixte Nzabonimana seemed to be waging a war similar to soldiers.  I can't quite get the right idea.  But I think we were going in the direction of the amplification of Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana's determination to sensitise people to the extermination of the Tutsis.  It's a mere amplification
Q.	And you want this Court to understand from this statement that you are not only a very accomplished liar, but you can lie not only about the substance, but also about the surrounding issue; is that correct? 
A.	The term used "substance" is a bit too legal and too complicated for me to understand its implications. 
Q.	Yes, I will move on to -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, you can either simplify or move on.  But I would like to bring to your notice that the break will be taken at the end and, therefore we need to -- we intend to conclude these proceedings today at quarter past five. 

MR. NG'ARUA: 
Thank you, Madam President.  I think I still have some 10 minutes to ask a few questions.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, all I'm saying is this: Over and above the specific instructions, that is, the substance, that you were instructed to lie about, you are such a good liar that you are able to even go further than that into other surrounding areas do make the main lie more believable; is that the case? 
A.	In the specific case, this is a job which took me time, because for me, it was the first homework or first work of this nature that I was assigned.  So I tried to invent things and to find arguments that I could attribute to Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana.  But let's say the qualification of being an excellent liar, I would say that is a situation that applies in particular circumstances.  But it did take me a lot of time to come up with this fabrication.  Otherwise, under normal circumstances, I'm not very good at lying.  The only thing is that this took me time.  I devoted all my time to the preparation of the statement at the time when the investigators would come to me. 
Q.	The statement that you are not a very good liar is a lie, isn't it?  Witness, how can this Court believe you when you come up with such a sophisticated lies, how can they believe you when you make another statement and give it to the Defence, a statement which is longer than this five-page statement, how would you want them to believe you? 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
That's a question for the Court, not for the witness.  I am sorry. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
I can put it to him and he can answer.  And, in any case, that was not supposed to be 
said -- sorry, My Lords.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)
MR. NG'ARUA: 
As the Court pleases. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we agree with Defence counsel that this is really a legal argument which is best addressed to the Trial Chamber at the appropriate time.  

But we would also like to remind Defence counsel to stand up in a gentle manner when he wants to intervene, seeks to be recognised and then make his intervention in future. That would be very much appreciated.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Thank you, Madam President.  I will move on.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, one last question, Counsel.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Yes.  I think it will go into a new area, because I wanted him to read another part and analyse it, but I think I can stop here, because also it will give him some time to recuperate.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, we have come to the end of your testimony for this week.  We would like to relieve you so that you can have a good rest.  We expect to finish your testimony next week.  And you may leave now, and we wish you a nice weekend.  
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Madam President.  
(Witness exited courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, Prosecution Counsel, where are you exactly?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My Lords, as we all appreciate, I am moving as fast as I can.  I hope to finish these two statements probably by the morning break tomorrow -- sorry, on Monday.  And then embark on the Murambi meeting of 18th April 1994, up to about an hour.  And, probably if the witness is not feeling too sickly, I intend to finish this cross-examination maybe by the first few minutes after lunch on Monday.  If he is better, we could even finish it a little earlier.  But to be very conservative, I think I would say a few minutes after lunch on Monday.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Learned Counsel, we hope that you are going to take the opportunity of this weekend to revisit your questions, make them more direct and simple and to conclude your cross-examination by the lunch break on Monday.  

We would like to remind you that you requested for an extension of investigations regarding certain matters which this witness testified upon, and it might very well be that we might continue with him on Thursday, for a limited period.  So we would urge you to really make sure that your cross is done by the lunch hour.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
We'll endeavour to do so, My Lords.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So, in that case, then arrangements should be made to bring the next witness by 2:30, 
Defence Counsel. 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Yes, it will be Witness T25.  We will make sure that he is around for the lunch break, Monday morning.  
And I just wanted also to indicate to Your Honours, after consultation with the lead counsel, we are breaking ranks from the opposition to the Court session between 5 and 15th July 2010.  As far as the Defence is concerned, it will be possible for us to say that.  I know that Your Honours will consider the matter of the rest of the scheduling in this trial.  I wanted to indicate that we would be available to come back between 5 and 15th July to continue.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel, for that information.  

The proceedings are adjourned to Monday morning, at 9 o'clock in the morning.
(Court adjourned at 1720H)
