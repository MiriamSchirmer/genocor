P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

This morning, we have a few matters to deal with, starting off of course with the indictment.  I would think that probably the first order of business would be to invite appearances.  

Prosecutor? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Good morning, Your Honour, and good morning to the rest of the Bench.  

Today the Prosecutor is represented by myself, Don Webster, the senior trial attorney.  We have the presence of the chief of Prosecution with us today, Mrs. Melanie Werrett.  Also joining us are assistant trial attorney Greg Lombardi, legal advisor/trial attorney Dior Sow Fall, assistant trial attorney 
Bongani Dyani, trial attorney Holo Makwaia.  Our ALOs are Tamara Cummings-John, Takeh Sendze and Sunkarie Ballah-Conteh, and we also have a number of legal interns that are with us in the Court today.  

Good morning to you all.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Prosecutor.  

For the Defence? 
MR. ROACH:
Good morning, President, and also good morning to the Judges who have joined us for this panel.  

My name is Charles Roach.  I am a member of the Ontario Bar and the Canadian Federal Court Bar.  I'm here today representing Mr. -- or Dr. Doctor Ngirumpatse.  And with me is, from the Parisian bar, my co-counsel Mr. Frederic Weyl.  I also have with me, who is in the gallery, my investigator 
	Mr. Phillip Taylor.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Roach. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Good morning, Mr. President, members of the Trial Chamber.  I'm Peter Robinson.  To my right is my client Joseph Nzirorera.  

Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Good morning, Your Honour.  My name is Dior Diagne of the Dakar bar.  I'm with my co-counsel, bar president, Mr. Sow, and we are defending Mr. Édouard Karemera's interests here.  

Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
MR. HOOPER:
On behalf of André Rwamakuba, my name is David Hooper.  I'm of the bar of England and Wales, as is my co-counsel, Andreas O'Shea.  Andreas O'Shea has been living for several years now in 
	South Africa, where he is professor of international law at the University of Kwa-Zulu-Natal.  And I'm also assisted by Ms. Seynabou Benga, who is of origin Senegalese, but of nationality Français.  And that is the team this morning.  

Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  You have noticed that we are sitting today on a panel of three judges.  On my right is Judge Emile Short, and on my left is Judge Gustave Kam.  We have been constituted as a Chamber, a Trial Chamber, a pre-Trial Chamber for the purpose of dealing with matters arising from the indictment.  

Before we commence the hearing this morning, I would just like to get an indication, for the purpose of time management mostly and not with the intention of applying a guillotine, so to speak, but could I get an indication of the duration of your presentations, bearing in mind that we've got written submissions which could facilitate a concise and focused presentation to us.  

Mr. Webster? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't think it would require more than 30 minutes for me to develop my arguments, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

For the Defence, an indication.
MR. ROACH:
Bearing in mind that you asked us to be brief and concise and to the point, Mr. President, I believe that you would find in our written materials the substance of our position, and if it had been read, we would need to say very little, so I don't believe that we will be more than a few minutes, I would think, five or ten minutes with respect to the issue of the indictment.  

I might point out that we have a situation here, you might say, two presentations from us, but I would deal with that later if it so happens to arise.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Roach. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I will need about one minute.
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I will need no more than seven minutes.
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, you have seen and read, no doubt, the motion that was submitted last night.  May I say with some trepidation, because I know, Mr. President, you had indicated that the shorter, the better, in terms of responses and motions, and we felt extremely guilty, I think, as we got to page 15 or 16 of that motion, but it does set out in detail our argument.  For that reason, I hope that I wouldn't take more than 15 or 20 minutes, at the most, to go through it and touch on the individual points.  If there are matters of particular jurisprudence that are touched upon in there, it may be that Professor or, I should say, Mr. O'Shea will be in the best position to assist the Court.  We are both prepared, in fact, to take as short as possible and provide you, I hope -- and provide you with as much assistance as you feel that we need to contribute.  

Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you think that in the -- in view of the way the presentations have been made, that the order of speeches from the Defence needs to be adjusted so that you speak first, or are you content to come up in this position?
MR. HOOPER:
I'm content to do that.  We have had a discussion between ourselves, and the first issue that probably will arise is which indictment, and coupled with that is the issue of which indictment is it applied to sever and which indictment is to be amended.  And we raise those points, I hasten to add, not in any sense of raising technicalities and avoiding the object of this morning's or today's meeting, which is to get somewhere appropriately quickly.  We are not raising the matters in that way.  We are raising the matters because we feel there is a proper way to go about this and an improper way, and if we go the latter path, there's going to be problems, perhaps, in the future.  With respect to the indictment and severance amendment, Mr. O'Shea will take that matter first, and then when we move on to the severance argument, I will deal with that as a whole, touching just on the points that are already set out before you -- I don't think there will be anything new -- but just outlining that.  And then subject to the nature of any inquiry that may come from the Bench, one or -- one of us will address the Tribunal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Yes, Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  Once again, thank you, Your Honours, and good morning.  

It is heartening to hear that we all expect this to be a rather brief series of arguments.  

I think I'm going to have to digress a bit and provide the Court with a bit of history of the indictment, in order for us to situate it in this stage of the trial.  Let me begin my summarising what is before the Court at this time.  There are three motions, actually.  The first motion in time is the motion of the 
	10th of September 2004.  That was a motion that the Prosecutor filed basically in response to the Appeals Chamber decisions of the 27th of August and the 11th of June.  It had to deal with what can be characterised as favourable rulings to Defence arguments that the last paragraph of the amended indictment of the 18th of February 2004 incorrectly pleaded joint criminal enterprise in its extended form.  So on the 10th of September, and this is before there was any decision on restarting the trial, the Prosecutor sought to amend the indictment that was then in place, unequivocally the amendment of the 18th of February 2004, to remove the language in paragraph 66, to introduce certain ministerial changes, errors in spelling and identification, and to expand the dates for certain incidents that were pleaded in that indictment.  

And, once again, I will remind the Court and the parties that this is before there was any decision from the Appeals Chamber directing us to restart the trial.  When that decision came down, and that was on the 28th of September, of course that changed the scenario a bit, and particularly after the 22nd of October decision, when the Appeals Chamber gave its reasons for asking us to restart again, it threw the object of that motion of the 10th of September into question.  Once it was clear to all the parties that we would have to restart the trial, the Prosecutor began to rethink the case and to devise a means of progressing in a manner that was expeditious and fair to all of the parties and to the trial itself.  And with that in view, we filed a motion on the 12th of November 2004.  That was a motion to sever Rwamakuba from the joint indictment against the other Accused, Ngirumpatse, Karemera and Nzirorera.  With that motion to sever, we appended an annexure, a proposed separate indictment against Rwamakuba.  So the Court was presented not only with our motion to sever Rwamakuba and ask for a separate trial, but we provided the Chamber and the parties with a view of the indictment that we would wish to proceed on in a separate trial against Rwamakuba.  

After that motion was filed, we gathered in a status conference here before the 
	Honourable Judge Byron on the 17th of November, and in response to the discussions that took place during the course of that status conference, we were advised by the Court to file what we envisaged would be a separate indictment against the remaining Accused on the joint indictment; which is to say, Karemera, Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera.  So in order to motivate or to further clarify what we expected to achieve with the severance of Rwamakuba, we filed yet another motion, and this was with the advice of the Court, setting forth what we expected to see in a separate trial against the remaining Accused on the indictment.  And that was the motion that was filed on the 19th of November 2004.  So we have three motions before us.  

The first motion that was filed is actually the last motion that is likely to be considered.  The motion that takes precedence and will set the tone and set the course for our discussions here today in the future of this case is really the severance motion that we filed against Rwamakuba, the motion of the 12th of November, so that is really the centrepiece of our attention.  Depending on how the Court rules on that motion, we will know whether we have to proceed and have a further discussion about the proposed separate indictment that was filed on the 19th of November.  So that is, briefly stated, what the Court has before it.  And what I would like to do at this point is provide the Court with a history of the indictment itself.  And when I say the indictment, it is not any particular indictment, but the history of the Prosecutor's approach to prosecuting the four persons that are before this Court today:  Édouard Karemera, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera and André Rwamakuba.  

The indictment that was originally confirmed against these four Accused was filed on the 
	29th of August 1998.  That is the beginning of this case procedurally.  That indictment was against eight Accused.  It was against Bizimana, Augustin; Nzabonimana, Callixte; Félicien Kabuga; 
	Juvénal Kajelijeli; Édouard Karemera; Mathieu Ngirumpatse; Joseph Nzirorera; and 
	André Rwamakuba.  So there were eight persons on that indictment.  That indictment itself was but a fragment of a larger instrument that the Prosecutor wanted to use to guide its prosecutions for this Tribunal.  That larger instrument was the indictment against Bagosora and 28 others that was filed in March of 1998.  I say that by way of introduction, because I would like the Court to understand that back in 1998, the Prosecutor had a very ambitious programme for moving his mandate forward in this Tribunal, relying or looking to the example of Nuremberg.  The thinking was to organise a mega trial which would not only be an opportunity to prove the guilt, the individual criminal responsibility of each Accused, but would be an opportunity for history to confront a whole series of unbelievable and incredible facts with credible evidence.  The trials were supposed to be a vehicle of documenting the history of the genocide.  It was a very ambitious project that has cut back or that has been tapered over time to where we stand before you today.  From the very ambitious project of trying to organise a huge trial, with all of the issues of the conspiracy and the interaction of the business elite, the government elite, the civilian elite, the military elite were going to be combined in one huge trial.  When that initial global indictment was rejected on jurisdictional grounds, the Prosecutor still attempted to proceed with that philosophy guiding its prosecutions.  And to that end, what was clearly a smaller indictment, but was still large, inasmuch as eight persons were accused, that was the indictment that was going to drive the case against Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Karemera, Nzirorera, Rwamakuba, the persons you have before you today.  

Back in 1999, July of 1999, which was approximately a year after the indictment was confirmed, there was another attempt on the part of the Prosecutor to organise a larger trial which would be a forum for looking at all of the issues in the genocide.  Since we were unable to proceed with Bagosora and 28 others because of jurisdictional questions, we learned from that disappointment, and we organised what we anticipated to be a joinder of three or four other cases, which was going to result in a huge trial again, but this time of 15 or 16 Accused.  What was then called the Government I case was to be joined with the Government II case, with the case against Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, the case against Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda; it was still going to be a huge trial, an ambitious undertaking, but it was still reduced in scope in relation to the original project of indicting Bagosora and 28 others in a trial of 29 persons.  That motion, as well, met with disfavour from the Trial Chamber.  At that time the cases were before Trial Chamber II, so, once again -- I believe the decision came down sometime in July of 2000 -- we were left with what was the originally-confirmed indictment against eight Accused.  

Part of that whole series of motions and deliberations included applications from the Defence.  Juvénal Kajelijeli applied for a severance; he met with success.  His case was severed.  A separate trial was organised for him, and that trial has already been adjudicated.  He was found guilty, and now it's in the appeal stages.  Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, another one of the Accused that had been anticipated to be part of a huge trial, went to trial all by himself.  He also has been found guilty; it has gone through the appeals stage, and his conviction was confirmed on appeal.  
Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda, another Accused that had been anticipated for this large trial against 15, went to trial by himself, was found guilty, and now his case is before the Appeals Chamber.  So what we have was an ambitious undertaking which was scaled back over time, and intermediate decisions were taken to try several Accused individually.  And those individual trials have gone, some of them, through the whole range of adjudications before this Tribunal because the judgements have been confirmed on appeal.  

Now, Your Honour, we find ourselves still with the indictment in our case against 
Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Édouard Karemera, André Rwamakuba and Joseph Nzirorera.  And faced with what was a grave disappointment to us and has forced us to rethink how we approach our prosecutions -- and here I refer of course to the Appeals Chamber decisions of the 
28th of September and the 22nd of October of this year -- we are in a position where we want to 
move forward but we would also like to use this opportunity to rethink how we approach our prosecutions and do it in a way that is effective, efficient, that conserves the resources, that is fair to the Accused, that is fair to the victims and fair to the process, and it is that that motivates our motions before you today, which is to sever André Rwamakuba, to proceed against him individually, and to focus our prosecutions against him, and to focus the prosecutions against the remaining three Accused and to do so in a manner that is fundamentally fair to the process and is effective and economical.  

Here is where we run into a stumbling block, however, and that is our divergent opinions about what the impact of those two Appeals Chamber decisions should be on how we move forward.  The Defence have clearly stated that their submissions, collectively and individually, is that the 
	Appeals Chamber decisions of the 28th of September and the 22nd of October vacate all judgements, all determinations made by the previous Trial Chamber, including its decision of the 13th of 
	February of 2004, which allowed us to file our amended indictment of the 18th of February.  Our position on that and our submission runs exactly counter to the Defence argument.  

We still insist that the operative instrument before this Trial Chamber is the amended indictment of the 18th of February 2004.  Our submission is that the Appeals Chamber decisions did not vacate that particular decision, that that particular decision is not tainted by an apprehension of bias, and that beyond the question of bias and beyond the characterisation of that decision, the Appeals Chamber decisions themselves did not specifically instruct this Trial Chamber or the parties that every single decision by the former Chamber would be set aside because of its ruling on the decision made by the two remaining Judges.  

If we direct our attention to the specific wording of those two Appeals Chamber decisions, and I would invite the Court to do so, when we look at the decision of the 28th of September, which basically sets forth its resolution of the issue, first of all, there is no mention of an apprehension of bias.  The decision is couched solely in terms of its assessment of an abuse of discretion.  Secondly, all it did was quash the decision of the two remaining Judges of the 16th of July.  It did not give any specific instructions to this Trial Chamber or to the parties of what was supposed to happen thereafter.  It did not characterise the previous decisions; it did not tell us that everything had to be litigated anew; it did not characterise the Trial Chamber's former decisions.  All it did was quash the decision of the two remaining Judges.  When we get to the reasoning that the Appeals Chamber provided the parties in this Trial Chamber on the 22nd of September, although there is a mention in several paragraphs that provide additional justification for its decision -- and essentially the decision is the one of the 
	28th of September -- I would offer to this Court my interpretation, which is any mention of bias was an aggravating factor that the Appeals Chamber used to further support its initial decision which is that there was abuse of discretion in deciding to continue the trial.

Let's look at the former Trial Chamber's decision of the 13th of February.  How did we get to that decision?  We got to that decision on the basis of adjudicating at least three or four major decisions.  Initially, the Prosecutor attempted to amend its indictment against these four Accused on the 
	29th of August 2003.  That was before the beginning of the trial.  That offer of amendment is substantially the same text that we have before us in the amendment of the 18th of February.  When we attempted to amend the indictment in August of 2003, the Trial Chamber ruled against us.  By its decision of the 8th of October 2003, it struck against the Prosecutor, and we ended up in 
	October of 2003 in a worse position than we were in when we started out trying to amend in August.  

The indictment that was in place prior to our request for amendment, or the indictment that was in place in August of 2003, accused each of the four Accused with 11 counts.  When we offered or attempted to amend the indictment, we wanted to remove four counts.  We wanted to change the text; we wanted to particularise our allegations; we wanted to narrow the proof at trial.  And when we got the decision from the Trial Chamber, not only were we not allowed to particularise and to narrow the case, the Trial Chamber partially granted our request, and what it meant by partially granting our request is that it removed four counts that were viable counts that we were willing to get rid of simply to move forward in a more expeditious manner.  So on the 8th of October 2003, in a weakened position in relation to where we started before we even requested an amendment, we appealed that decision.  On the 19th of December 2003, the Appeals Chamber came back and sided with the Prosecutor in contesting that decision of the Trial Chamber.  And it was on the basis of that Appeals Chamber decision on the 19th of December that we refiled a motion to amend which was ultimately granted by the Trial Chamber on the 13th of February.  

Now, when we look at the decision of the 13th of February, which allowed us to amend, I would submit to this Court that it's inconceivable to suggest that that decision is tainted by an apprehension of bias.  That decision is the direct product of instructions from the Appeals Chamber.  And in instructing the Trial Chamber, the Appeals Chamber was essentially criticising the Trial Chamber for ruling against the Prosecutor in its decision.  How can a decision that went against the Prosecutor initially be tainted with bias to the Defence?  The Trial Chamber essentially gave the Defence more than they asked for, actually, in opposing our motion, because not only did they oppose our textual amendments, they removed four counts that was viable.  So there is no way that any -- that this 
Trial Chamber or any other parties could suggest that the Trial Chamber was tainted by bias or even an apprehension of bias in adjudicating our motions to amend.  They ruled against us.  They took away more than we had -- they took things away from us as opposed to granting our application.  And it was only because the Appeals Chamber ruled against them that they reapplied the reasoning that was given to them by the Appeals Chamber and finally granted our amendment on the 13th of February.  How can that decision be tainted by an apprehension of bias?  Beyond the question of apprehension of bias, this is not the type of decision I would offer to the Court that was anticipated as falling to the wayside because the trial had to start anew.  When we read through the Appeals Chamber reasoning in its 22nd of October decision, it is focusing on the ability of the triers of fact to observe the demeanour of witnesses, so it is clearly -- my submission is that it is clear that the Appeals Chamber was focusing on the need of the Trial Chamber to observe the evidence in the trial.  So it is the evidentiary issues that are paramount when this Trial Chamber or the recomposed 
Trial Chamber goes back and looks at the prior proceedings and makes its decision of what should be conserved from the previous proceeding and what needs to be set aside.  And my submission to this Court is that what needs to be set aside are the evidentiary rulings, and not the procedural rulings and not the legal analysis in prior decisions, particularly in situations where the Appeals Chamber has stepped in and offered its reasoning and confirmed the reasoning of the Trial Chamber or imposed its reasoning in the place of the reasoning of the Trial Chamber.  

That threshold issue of which indictment is the operative instrument now is not one that we can avoid.  Because in any application to amend, the Court has to look at what is to be amended and what is it amending.  And one of the criteria for deciding whether amendment is appropriate or not are issues of the due diligence of the Prosecutor in conducting investigations, in the legal sufficiency of the pleadings, of whether the amendment is narrowing the case or broadening the case.  Those are the criteria that the Appeals Chamber gave us in its decision of the 19th of December 2003.  And in order to apply those criteria to any application of the Prosecutor to amend, we have to know what is being proposed and what it is being proposed in relation to.  So there is no way we can avoid looking at which instrument is operative, because in order for the Court to consider whether the amendment is appropriate or not, it has to look at what was there before it.  

Let's move on to the severance issue.  Because I would submit that if we look at the issue of severance and make a decision on the severance, it will inform our reasoning on every other issue, and if the Court decides the severance motion, it can then decide every subsequent motion by applying the same reasoning.  What we seek to do in severing Rwamakuba is, once again, to narrow the case against him.  Let's look at the situation.  We started out with 11 counts against Rwamakuba, 11 viable counts, because the counts we wish to remove -- we didn't remove them because we didn't have the evidence, we removed them because we wanted to streamline our prosecutions.  Starting with 11 counts, we narrowed it down to seven, and now we are prepared to narrow it down to four.  How can this be to the prejudice of the Accused, to find himself initially accused of 11 counts -- genocide, incitement, conspiracy, extermination, murder, rape, war crimes -- 11 counts starting out in the original indictment, which is where the Defence -- the Accused want to take us back, to where we now stand where we are proposing to try him only for genocide, alternatively, complicity and genocide, extermination and murder, four counts, and when you look at those four clearly, they really amount to two counts:  Genocide, complicity, in the alternative.  So if we prevail on the genocide count, there is no consideration of the complicity count, extermination and murder.  If we prevail on the extermination count, this Trial Chamber is not likely to affirm or to make a conviction on the murder count.  That is what the jurisprudence of this Tribunal tells us every time there has been proof in cases that have gone to trial and that have been confirmed on appeal, and extermination and murder were satisfied or proven by the evidence.  The Trial Chamber has only convicted on extermination, because it has characterised murder as a lesser-included offence or as covered by the extermination conviction.  So here we stand in a situation where we want to reduce 11 counts basically to two counts.  How can this prejudice the Accused?  The case has diminished significantly, not in its significance to the mandate of this Tribunal, but in our approach to it, because we have learned from the history of our own prosecutions, and our own ambitions from 1998 have been scaled back progressively over the years because we have learned from our practice.  When we look at the Cyangugu trial, the Media trial, the Butare trial, and we see how much time and effort and resources is spent proving allegations that could be effectively resolved over a period of months as opposed to over a period of years, we have learned, the Tribunal has learned, and we would urge upon this Court to take advantage of this opportunity and streamline the case so that we can complete our business here.  And we want that not because we want to obtain a strategic advantage over the Accused.  We are determined to mount fair prosecutions and effective prosecutions, and that aspect of our mandate we do not abandon.  But what we are trying to do is approach it with greater deliberation and to learn from our past practice and to draw upon the experience of this Tribunal as we move forward.  And the Appeals Chamber decision of the 22nd of October gives us an opportunity to rethink and to move forward more effectively.  And I'm asking this Court to take advantage of that opportunity.  

What are the Defence objections?  Well -- and I anticipate their arguments, because I'd like to move things ahead, so I will simply comment to the Court on the submissions that they have already made from last week and in writing.  And I would -- if we look at all of the written submissions, we notice that the three Accused from what would be the larger case, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera, and Édouard Karemera, basically line up behind the analysis offered by André Rwamakuba in opposing his severance.  So in dealing with Rwamakuba's objections, we are basically dealing with the objections of all four Accused.  And what does Rwamakuba say?  First of all, he says that the Rules do not allow us to sever because we are out of time.  It is a completely fallacious argument.  Let's look at the rules, Your Honour, because what Rwamakuba would have us do is refer ourselves to Rule 72(B)(iii), preliminary motions.  This is not a preliminary motion. 
	(Pages 1 to 11 by Leslie Todd) 




































	0945H 
MR. WEBSTER: 
	Preliminary motions are Defence motions.  There is a whole line of case law adjudicating preliminary motions, and standing for some of the propositions put forth by Rwamakuba, but those are propositions -- that is reasoning that the Appeal Chamber and the Trial Chamber have adopted to adjudicate Defence motions, not Prosecution motions.  

Look at Rule 72.  Preliminary motions are motions that contest -- we can go to the text.  They challenge jurisdiction.  The Prosecutor is not going to bring an indictment and then challenge his jurisdiction to bring the indictment.  The alleged defects in the form of the indictment, the Prosecution is not going to deliberately plead defects in form in his own indictment.  

Seeking the severance of counts joined in one indictment or seeking separate trials, that is a Defence motion at this stage.  So, time limits of Rule 72 govern Defence's applications, not Prosecutor's application.  Our motion is brought under Rule 73.  It is not explicitly stated in our motion papers, because it is implicit.  

Defence motions are preliminary motions.  Prosecution motions fall under the general rubric of      Rule 73.  And the specific rule that governs severance and separate trial is Rule 82(B).  And that is what motivates our application.  And that is clearly stated in our motion paper.  So, there is no issue of timing.  The rules do not prevent us from filing a severance motion at this time.  

Fairness issues should govern this Court's deliberation.  I'm not suggesting that the Prosecutor can be completely arbitrary.  Of course, there is a fairness issue to be decided.  But look at our situation here, going from 11 counts to, basically, what is two counts; how can that be unfair to the Accused?

Let me complete my thought with this issue of timing, because even if I am wrong in my submissions, and even if this Court is minded to apply Rule 72(B)(3), it is a completely specious argument, because what Rule 72(B) tells us to do, or what the rules govern amendment of indictment tell us to do is to offer supporting materials to the Trial Chamber in order to consider amendment.  And if we had to start all over again and file our motion to amend on the basis of the original indictment of November 2003 -- excuse me, November 2001, all of these time limits would kick in again, because we would have to serve supporting material.  And within 30 days of the service of those supporting materials, the time limitations would begin to run and we would be within the time limits of the rule, if the Court were going to apply the rule.  

Now, of course, my submission is that this rule is not applicable.  But if the Court decides that the rule is applicable, the time limit of the rule itself is going to open the door for motion to a severance the minute we file our application to amend again.  So, it is a completely specious argument that the rules prevent filing of a severance motion at this time.

Beyond the issue of timing, Rwamakuba objects saying that he is caused prejudice and that there should be some principle of estoppel that prevents the Prosecutor from requesting severance at this time.  It is a completely fallacious argument, Your Honours.  He suggests that because he anticipated a huge trial or a larger trial, to now narrow the trial prejudices him.  How is that tenable?  I mean, to accept that proposition is to accept the proposition that it is easier to defend against 11 counts than it is to defend against two counts.  

Motivating our motion to sever it is clearly stated that we are not proceeding on a conspiracy count.  The conspiracy to commit genocide is removed from the indictment.  We are not going to attempt to bring in proof of Rwamakuba's meeting and conspiring with other interim government ministers and other MRND leaders to commit genocide; that count is put to the wayside.  All of the proof that would go into that, for the most part, is dispensed with.  

We are not proceeding on joint criminal enterprise as a form of commission theory.  The entire proof of the case, if we go against Rwamakuba separately, is going to be based on his own acts and omissions.  It is entirely going to ordering, instigating, aiding and abetting, his direct participation in the crimes that are charged.  It is an extremely narrow approach to our Prosecution.  We think it is going to be an effective approach.  We are not giving the Accused a benefit necessarily, we intend to convict him of those crimes, but we are going to do so in a manner that is more straightforward, more direct, which takes less time, which is less burdensome on the witnesses, which is less burdensome on the Court.  It is simply more effective.  

What is driving us at this stage is an attempt to be effective and fair.  And it cannot be alleged that by narrowing a case from 11 counts to 2 counts and by narrowing our theory of Prosecution from conspiracy to joint criminal enterprise, to narrow direct participation that we are being unfair to the Accused, it does not make sense.  The scale is too huge.  Eleven counts conspiracy, joint criminal enterprise is two counts which are essentially focused on killings, the same evidentiary basis.  And all we want to do is show that he directly participated in committing those crimes.  How can that be unfair?  

The Defence offers several arguments or several means of illustrating how it is unfair.  What does he say?  Is that he needs time to prepare his witnesses.  Well,  that is not an issue, because even if the Defence needs more time because he anticipated a trial taking a longer period of time, the Defence case can come months after the Prosecution case is completed.  We anticipate on the base of 20 witnesses, and those witnesses were set forth in Annex C to our motion, that on the basis of those 20 witnesses we can complete our case in approximately two months, not more.  Six weeks is our estimate, but to be judicious, or to not box ourselves in, I would suggest that if we were working on a full-time basis, we can hear those 20 witnesses in two months. If we had to go to trial on the basis of 11 counts, proving 11 counts against four Accused, there is no way we can complete the segment of the trial that concerns Rwamakuba in two months.  

The scope of the trial is reduced.  It is fairer to the parties; it is fairer to the process.  And we are asking this Court to rule in our favour. 

If Rwamakuba needs more time, because in his estimation it is more difficult to defend against two counts than it is to defend against 11 counts, give him more time.  Allow us to prove our case in two months; adjourn the case, and he can come back when he is ready.  But his complaints, which I'm asking this Court not to credit, are simply not a basis to rule in his favour.  They simply do not stand up; the reasoning does not stand up. 

What is another complaint?  Well, you know, Rwamakuba likes the disclosure that he gets when he is in a larger case.  Disclosure is complete.  Disclosure was voluminous.  For all practical purposes, it is complete.  He has as much disclosure as he can possibly use, going into a one-defendant case, a case that is now focused on him is not going to deprive him of disclosure, particularly in light of the Prosecutor's offer of an electric disclosure suite that basically opens up our database to the entire Defence bar. 

Once more, the same case that we intend to mount in a separate trial of Rwamakuba, if the Court allows us to do so, is going to resurface in the context of a larger case, if the Court forces us to go to trial against four persons together.  So there will be no advantage to Rwamakuba in opposing the severance.  He is going to meet the same case.  He is going to have it in the same form.  And all it is going to do is take more time and more resources to complete.  

The last leg of their opposition has to do with the impact on the other Accused, because he is alleging that there would be undue delay caused to the case against all four of them if his case is severed.  It is completely a fallacious argument, Your Honour, because our proposal is that both cases, both separate cases remain in the same Chamber.  And if this is the Chamber that tries the case, what we would propose is that we start with the Rwamakuba case.  We do that for two months, or six weeks, or four weeks, whatever the Court determines.  And when Rwamakuba leaves, the other three Accused will take his place, and the Prosecution will continue, and the Court will continue.  
So the only persons that will possibly be inconvenienced or burdened by this procedure are the Prosecution team and the Trial Chamber. 

Evidence will come in at the same pace.  It is just a question of whether the Court is going to focus on Rwamakuba, deal with his issues, then adjourn and start up again against the other three Accused.  It is trying the case in relay in a way that is much more effective, much more economical and much fairer to the process, and has been done in other cases.

Your Honours, quite frankly, there is much more that I can say, but respecting our anticipated schedule, I will conclude -- begin to conclude my remarks now, allow the Court to hear from the Defence, and then welcome the Court to ask me questions, or to pose its difficulties with my argument to me so that I can respond to them, because the issue is too important, and it is going to determine how we conduct ourselves over the next two years. 

In conclusion --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
	Yes, in conclusion, Your Honours, my submission is essentially --
MR. PRESIDENT:
 (Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your microphone, please, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, I'm sorry.  

Before you conclude, there is just one question I wanted you to address.  We have heard your submissions.  We have been hearing your submissions on severance.  What would you expect us to do now if the application on severance is rejected?  Would the simple order rejecting severance be sufficient, or should we consider anything else at the moment, if there was a lack of success on your application?
MR. WEBSTER: 
	If the severance was rejected, it throws a wrench in the progress of the trial as we have envisioned it, because the motion to amend the indictment against Ngirumpatse, Karemera and Nzirorera hinges on success with the severance motion.  

We filed that proposed amendment on the 19th, basically, to clarify all of the issues that would arise if severance were granted, to give the Court and the parties an opportunity to see what the resulting indictment against the remaining three would be if severance was granted.  So that application to amend against the other three is really, for all practical purposes, an extension of our application to sever.  

If the Court will recall when we met on the 17th, I was opposed to filing the motion to amend at that time because my submission was that the issue of the consequential amendment was not germane to deciding the severance issue, but the Court ruled otherwise.  And we filed our motion to amend, but that falls to the wayside if severance is rejected.  And we would have to refile our application to amend against all four, you know, in order to be consistent with the Court's decision and instructions.  So, I mean, it would put us back to ground zero, and we would have to start the ball rolling all over again. 

But, Your Honours, what we would request is that in any decision, whether it grants our application to sever or, hopefully, not, but rejects it, that the Court has to give us some indication of what indictment it is looking at, what indictment it considers as a viable, operating instrument at this time, so that we have some guidance on how we should proceed in filing a further motion to amend.  And it's clarity on that point that is going to point the way forward for us.

Did you have another question, Your Honours?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, it sort of arises out of your answer. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Because there is already a pending motion for the amendment of the indictment against all four Accused.  You are saying that that motion is withdrawn?
MR. WEBSTER: 
	It is not withdrawn at this time.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But should we consider it?
MR. WEBSTER: 
	It is difficult to answer that question, because that indictment was premised on the status quo ante.  It was before the Appeal Chamber decision on the 22nd of October, that decision is what the Defence are hanging on to suggest that the indictment of the 18th of February is no longer valid.  When we filed that motion to amend on the 10th of September, it was clear that the only indictment that was governing the trial was the indictment of the 18th of February 2004.  That has been thrown into question now.  

And the Court has to address that question so that we know if our motion of the 10th of December is an appropriate way to amend or not, because that motion was premised on the 18th of February 2004 being the valid indictment, it was to amend that indictment.  And even our application today is premised on our submission, which is that the indictment that is currently in place, guiding us, is the amended indictment of the 18th of February 2004.  

And there is no way we can avoid addressing the issue of severance, or addressing the issue of moving forward without clear instructions from the Trial Chamber as to which indictment at this moment, as we speak, is depriving these Accused of their liberties.  Something has to be in place.  And we need a clear idea of what it is so we know how to approach amending it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you. 
MR. ROACH: 
	Mr. President and members of the Court, it may be advisable that the Rwamakuba team leads this matter.  And if it is your -- if you give me permission to do so, I should like to make my submissions following what we hear from the Rwamakuba team.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I had, in fact, offered an opportunity for that already.  And who is going to speak first, I am willing to hear him. 
MR. HOOPER: 
	Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  Before coming to the specific severance argument, I invite my          co-counsel, Mr. O'Shea, to address you on the particular -- on particular aspects relating to the indictment or indictments. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
	Your Honours, good morning.  I am O'Shea.  And I would just like to address, if I may, whether this application is properly brought, that is, logically the first thing in time.  And as Mr. Hooper has already indicated, we are not trying to prevent things from going forward here.  And it may be that with some judicial artfulness technicalities of these matters can be stepped over.  

But that having been said, an indictment in these international criminal tribunals has, if I may say, more of a sanctity, if I can put it that way, than it might in the jurisdiction that Mr. Hooper and I come from.  An indictment in an international criminal proceeding is a very public document.  It is a document that goes across the internet, around the world, and essentially puts in place the credibility of the whole process with regard to peace and reconciliation.  So it is an important document.  And I know that Your Honours would prefer, if at all possible, to avoid the history of this case, to avoid entering into the issues of apprehension of bias. 

And I think we can try to do that in so much as possible.  Unfortunately, it has been raised by the Prosecution.  And, at least, in relation to the indictment itself, it is almost an unavoidable issue.  I think that we, on behalf of André Rwamakuba, are not terribly concerned, after the issue of joinder or severance has been resolved, what the indictment will look like eventually, in the sense that we recognise that the jurisprudence is somewhat in favour of the Prosecution in terms of amending the indictment at an early stage of the proceeding.  That having been said, we believe that the Prosecution has, in a way, put the cart before the horse.  

The Prosecution, interestingly -- and you will see some arguments on this towards the end of our motion.  The Prosecution has, interestingly, in the case of the Rwamakuba request for a separate trial not sought leave to amend the indictment, and, at the same time, has recognised that they add a charge or a count in their proposed severed indictment. 

So it is important for us to know, in the light of that, in the light of the fact that the Prosecution are not seeking leave to amend, which indictment we are talking about.  Mr. Webster argues that in relation to the decision of the 13th of February 2004 of the Trial Chamber and where the Trial Chamber partially allows the Prosecution to amend the indictment, that there is, if I can put it in Mr. Webster's words, "No way that that can be tainted by bias." 

We have a decision from the Appeals Chamber, and the reasons were provided later, and so the first document that came through from the Appeals Chamber was, obviously, not intended to set out the full picture.  But in the reasons that are provided by the Appeals Chamber in their judgement, it is abundantly clear that there is a finding of reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the presiding judge.  There is no doubt about that in the reading of the Appeal Chamber's decision.  

We say that it necessarily and impliedly follows from that that all decisions which have been reached by that presiding judge, at least, at the very least following the moment of the event which gives rise to that apprehension, that those decisions are necessarily invalidated by a finding of apprehension of bias.  That does not mean to say that decisions cannot be resurrected by this Trial Chamber in appropriate cases, and usually by consent of the parties. We say that that is the basic effect.  

I think, I may invite Your Honours to ask yourself this question in considering that particular issue, which is plain to us but apparently not plain to the Prosecution, and put ourselves in the shoes of the reasonable man, because that is the test.  How would the reasonable man feel if a Court made a finding that there -- that his apprehension of bias on the part of a judge was correct, but then the Court said, "but some of the decisions that that judge made against you still apply"?  How would the reasonable man feel in those shoes?  And I will leave it there, because I think if you Judges ask yourselves that question, in my submission there is only one conclusion that Your Honours can reach, and that is that the indictment of November 2001 is the valid indictment.

It would have been possible to step over this question had the Prosecution put their procedural steps in a different way, but the way in which they have proceeded makes it impossible for us to avoid that question.  And if November 2001 applies -- 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. O'Shea.
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes.
JUDGE SHORT:
We will ask ourselves the question that you've just posed, but we would like you to assist us by citing any authorities for your proposition that all of the decisions by the presiding judge are necessarily invalidated here.  Do you have any authority to support that proposition?
MR. O'SHEA: 
	Well, I don't have any authority to hand, and I think that there is a reason for that, Your Honours.  Most of the authority that deals with the question of apprehension of bias are from national jurisdiction.  The only authorities that I am aware of in international jurisdictions are the cases before the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, Furundzija and the case before the special court in Sierra Leone Sesay.  

Now, in both of those cases, the kind of scenario that we are faced with here was not present.  And in national jurisdictions one is not usually faced with a situation of such a large, complex trial which starts again with a large plethora of written decisions that have to be looked at. 

That having been said, I could refer Your Honours to the Sesay decision before the special court for Sierra Leone; that was a question where the presiding judge of the Appeals Chamber had been challenged on the basis that he had written a book named, "Crimes Against Humanity," and in that book he had made comments, which could have been viewed as conclusions about the guilt of the accused in the RUF trials.  And an application was made to have Judge Robertson disqualified from that court.

Now, it is interesting the moments at which that application was made, because at the point that that application had been made the Appeals Chamber had already heard several applications in the form of preliminary motions.  For example, there had already been argument on the question of whether the Lomé amnesty applied to the RUF case before the Appeals Chamber.  And Judge Robertson had presided over that hearing.  And there had already been preliminary deliberations in relation to that.  

And what the Court did when it found that Judge Robertson must be disqualified is it re-deliberated.  It did not rely on the deliberations of Judge Robertson, but it re-deliberated.

So, in a sense, while that is a different situation from the one here, it does indicate a recognition.  And we say it is a fairly sort of obvious recognition that if there is a finding of apprehension of bias -- and in the case of Robertson it wasn't actual bias, it was apprehension of bias -- that previous deliberations should not be considered as valid.  It may be possible to get a hold of the transcripts of those proceedings before the special court, I don't know.  But while deliberations are different from decisions, I would suggest that the same principle applies.  Does that assist? 
JUDGE SHORT:
Well, we will look at the transcripts of that decision.
MR. O'SHEA: 
	Yes.
JUDGE SHORT:
And if you have any other authorities, you can furnish the Court with them.
MR. O'SHEA: 
	Yes, I don't believe -- without going back to it, I don't believe that the authority of Furundzija would assist, particularly on the particular point of previous decisions.  But what I can say is this: if one looks at the national decisions -- and I didn't come here prepared on this, but I can refer to a few.  There is a decision in the House of Lords called Gough, G-O-U-G-H.  There is a decision in the House of Lords called Pinochet.  There is an Australia decision called Webb, W-E-B-B.  There is a South African decision called The South African Rugby Union case.  

And I think that if Your Honours have regard to those various national decisions, Your Honours will find that, generally speaking, when a question of apprehension of bias has been found, the tribunal, normal speaking, needs to be reconstituted. And that was the case in the Pinochet case.  Indeed, it is the case in this case; and if it is the case, then there can be no question of a judge to which an appearance of bias attaches making any further decisions.  I would submit that that is also relevant in the consideration of how one treats past decisions.  There is a certain element of consistency in the way one needs to go about understanding the effects of apprehension of bias.  
And if it is accepted that a judge to which such an apprehension attaches can take no further part in proceedings, which was the case here where the two remaining judges had to deal with the question of retrial, then, logically, that must apply to past decisions as well.  But to any specific authority, I'm unable assist.  

The effect is that, we say, that if we are correct in that necessary presumption, then in relation to the indictment, the proposed indictments against the other three Accused, the Prosecution must seek leave to amend that indictment if they want to put forward a proposed indictment with new charges, and the same applies to our proposed indictment.  So, that is, in a sense, a technical barrier to this severance application.  And I would invite this Court to reject the application for severance on the basis that the parties have not been appraised of proper indictments, proper proposed indictments, in the sense that those proposed indictments do not accord with the valid indictment, if I can put it that way.

I would just like to deal with two other sorts of barriers to this application, if I can put it that way.  First of all, I would like to deal with the question of the time bar.  Of course, the jurisprudence -- and I won't go into this too deeply because I know that time is short, and Your Honours have the argument that we have on this, but the jurisprudence does, of course, recognise that that time bar can be waived.  And the cases that deal with that are generally cases of conflict of interests which, of course, involve a particular danger.  

If there is, indeed, as the Courts put it, extraordinary basis for seeing a conflict of interest, then it is obviously in the interest of justice to waive that time limit, and we don't dispute that.  But we have to, of course, dispute the Prosecution contention that the concept of preliminary motions is a concept that only applies to the Defence and does not apply to the Prosecution.  And in my respectful submissions, Your Honours, that would not only be illogical as a finding, but unfair, fundamentally unfair; because, of course, once the procedures specified in Rule 72 have been complied with and the 30 days begins to run, either party can raise an issue of law.  If it is an issue over joint criminal enterprise, for example, that could come from the Defence or it could come from the Prosecution.  

There is nothing in Rule 72, or the rules generally, preventing the Prosecution from bringing forward a legal motion during that 30-day period. And wouldn't it be fundamentally unfair if the same legal motion could be brought by the Prosecution at any time but could only be brought by the Defence within a prescribed time?  That surely cannot be right.  So there is a question of equality of arms which Your Honours interpret Rule 72.

But apart from that, Your Honours also have to, in my submission, have regard to the fact that in this case there has been a proper joinder.  And there has been a decision on joinder, which has been argued and decided.  And the Prosecution has never argued that we were not properly joined.  In light of the fact that we have been properly joined, fundamental fairness would suggest that the rules which apply to the party applying to severance must be the same, whether it comes from the Prosecution or whether it comes from the Defence.  

And while we recognise that that time limit can be waived for good cause, and, indeed, we also recognise that possibly the Prosecution could have reinstated themselves in 2003, that time limit has passed.  The Prosecution has not requested for leave to waive that time limit.  They have not said that -- or recognised that they need to show good cause.  And we say that in any event because we are on the eve of the trial, and because they have had so much time to deal with this that, therefore, good cause could not even be shown proprio motu, if I can put it that way.

In the decisions that deal with this question of waiver of the time limits, and Your Honours will observe that there is reference to a situation arising, a conflict of interest arising during trial, for example.  In this case the new situation which has arisen, the question of apprehension of bias and retrial, is not one that goes to the issue.  And the new situation which has arisen, which the Prosecution relies on is time.  But that, in my respectful submission, is not a new situation.  It is perhaps a progressive situation.  And it is a situation which, at the very least, in 2003, when there was another opportunity to put in preliminary motions, the situation in 2003 was essentially no different from now.

Let me just come on to a third point of barrier here and in relation to time.  When Your Honours are faced with an application for severance, in my respectful submission, Your Honours have to have something to decide.  There has to be a contentious issue before Your Honours; it has to be a matter in dispute.  Now, the Prosecution relies on interest of justice.  I won't deal with that issue because that is the issue that will be dealt with by Mr. Hooper.  But what I do say is this:  The Prosecution specifically rely upon the right of the Accused not to be tried without undue delay, and they specifically rely on the right of the Accused to a fair trial.

Now, they have not argued that a joint trial would constitute a violation of either of those rights.  They have sort of tentatively suggested, through their motion, that delay will be assisted.  But they have not taken the steps suggesting that there would be a violation of the rights of the Accused to trial without undue delay or the right to a fair trial if the Accused remained joined.  And if they are not arguing a violation of either of those rights under the rules, then what is it that Your Honours are deciding here?  

In my respectful submission, if there is to be compelling reasons in the interest of justice to sever the Accused on the basis of one of those two rights, the party alleging it must, at the very least, first argue there's been a violation, or would be a violation in joinder.  And if they haven't taken that step,        Your Honours are sort of left in this quagmire of having to decide in the context of no allegation of a violation.

	1030H
JUDGE SHORT:
Is that - is it not implied from their application for severance?  But if severance is not granted, there'll be a violation of that right by a joint trial.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Well, Your Honours -- you know, I think Your Honour raises a good point, but we're not dealing with the interpretation of a decision or a rule here; we're dealing with an argument of a party.  And if a party wishes to make an assertion or an allegation, they have to make it.  They have referred to the right to a fair trial, they have referred to the right not to be tried without undue delay, and they have said that it would assist to sever, but in my submission that is not enough for this Court to imply from that argument that the Prosecution is of the view that the Defence would have an unfair trial.  In fact, in all fairness, if it is the view of the Prosecution that we would have an unfair trial in a joint trial, they must tell us, because we're entitled to know that.  

Unless I may be of any further assistance, those are the points I wish to raise. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. O'Shea. 
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. David Hooper for Rwamakuba.  

I suppose the basic theme that runs through the written motion -- written response to the Prosecutor's motion is that this is all too much too late.  The initial matters have been dealt with, I think, wholly and adequately by Mr. O'Shea dealing with our submissions that the Prosecution are out of time, that they need to show good cause.  They don't in fact show good cause, nor do the merits of their argument sustain that, that the history of this trial and of the Prosecution management of the case places them in a particular position and responsibility.  It's almost six and a half years now since that indictment was authorised, not long after that before André Rwamakuba was transferred from Namibia to here.  

In touching on the history, it's right to remind ourselves that the Prosecution have come before the Chamber not once or twice, but I think three if not four times in order to seek joinders, wider joinders.  And they cannot be too surprised if what they've said in support of those joinders being both expeditious and in the interest of the individual Accused, those words don't necessarily come to haunt them after six and a half years.  Because of the delay and because of what has been said, because indeed of their opposition in 2000 to an application on behalf of Rwamakuba at that time for severance, at a time when he had a chance of joinder, for example, with Kamuhanda who was dealing with Gikomero, a significant aspect of his case, at a time when there was a Butare indictment in which Rwamakuba was named in 1998 and to which he could have been joined, and where he could have sat in court with others sharing his interest in respect to allegations concerning Butare, all that has been denied him by the Prosecution.  I, myself, approached the Prosecution in 2000 and suggested severance and joinder with Kamuhanda.  The application for severance in 2000, as you know or at least have heard about, but if need be we can provide the necessary documents, was based on the argument that there was a perceived conflict of interest between Rwamakuba and the other co-Accused, that that matter was decided against us by the Tribunal on the Prosecution argument supporting or raised against the argument.  

So here we are many years on down the line, and I think, as is the phrase used in the motion, on the eve of trial.  How has the situation really been said to change so compellingly recently that the Prosecution are now justified to talk about the necessity for severance in order to secure the Accuseds' position?  We submit that both by reason of the difficulties in terms of showing cause and by the position that they've assumed over the many years, they are variously - should be perceived to either have waived their -- any right they have to make such a claim or that they are stopped from making that claim.  

So we come down to this, that the Prosecution say "delay", that's their -- essentially their argument that they bring before you.  And a moment ago Mr. O'Shea touched on that in terms of -- is what they've shown, in fact, a true sufficiency of argument there in respect to that?  Have they demonstrated severances really necessary to avoid delay and, in fact, can they really have anything other than a hollow argument in respect to that quite aside from any stated interest or any stated argument or interest that they erect in terms of the interest of the Accused?  We say that's a hollow argument that they're taking and that they are not truly bringing this in the interests of the Accused, as the history hitherto demonstrates.

They touch, as we know, on the aspect of a speedier trial for the Accused, and those matters are touched on in respect of our argument.  And I don't think I need to take you in any detail to that.  Are in fact two separate trials likely to be completed, we ask, a shorter time of one and three, or is there in fact a good argument or a fair argument here that one and three equals four in all probability?  We also raise the possibility that one and three may be longer than four and that all those elements are very, very speculative.  

They argue that a separate trial would be speedier through the avoidance of superfluous cross-examination and the witnesses will be spared what they call "excessive cross-examination."  We needn't be so speculative here because we can go to the transcripts of the vacated trial and see what in fact happened, and we, in this essence, say, well, that's not borne out by any scrutiny of what actually took place.  
And they also argue that the Tribunal can continue pre-trial preparation for the three while the Rwamakuba case is under way.  And the argument, of course -- or, our counterargument to that is that that rests on the assumption that we are absolutely under starter orders and ready to go, and I'm afraid -- I'm afraid we're not.  We're not yet in the store yet.  At least, we don't consider that we can be with much to do -- and with much to do because, to a great extent, we've been placed in a situation where we have both, as advocates preparing a trial, reasonable expectations hitherto as to the time in which we have in order to discharge are heavy and, may I add, difficult responsibilities in that respect so much so that we can argue that, in fact, a joint trial here will actually start earlier than perhaps a single trial for Rwamakuba.  And though this may be the subject of contention from colleagues here today this morning, we feel that there's no reason why a joint trial couldn't start before February, subject, of course, to the availability of judiciary and space here.

We touch on the delay of -- that they talk of witnesses, but if you're going to call 80 witnesses, then you're going to have a No. 1 and a No. 80, and that's a matter of choice for the Prosecution.  So we don't feel there's any weight to be attached to that argument.  

And finally, if one looks at the Prosecution argument, they say, well, we're here to preserve the interests of the Accused in order to effect a speedier trial, i.e., that it will start earlier.  That doesn't seem to be borne out.  In fact, hearing the Prosecution this morning, one might be forgiven for saying, well, we're not here to concern ourselves so much for the interests of the Accused and of justice in terms of delay, but we're here really -- in the Prosecution's words this morning -- to rethink our Prosecution policy after six and a half years.  So, in terms of whether it's a trial that will come on earlier, or trials that can come on earlier, we say that's conjecture and not, in fact, borne out by how we see the situation in any event, with respect.  

And in respect to the question of a speedier trial, we say that that brings in its train particular difficulties for the Defence which are touched on in other aspects, in other parts of the motion.  And we saw what may be of some assistance, and that is -- and it's referred to, I think, in our paragraph 28 of the motion.  There's a reference in Archbold's International Criminal Courts Practice where they extract their editor's view that the mere fact that an accused's trial would be speedier if he or she would try to (unintelligible) is not of itself a reason for severance, quoting Nodiam Bardgy (phonetic).  And, indeed, the present situation which we find ourselves endorses, with respect, that observation.  

And finally -- or, penultimately, I should say, we come to the preference of the Accused.  Mr. President, you'll notice that, as you've noticed on the previous occasions when we've been here, that Dr. Rwamakuba is not in attendance today.  He told me he was coming today, so I was rather disappointed not to see him, but he hasn't been to Court for four years and I suppose it may be a difficult step for him to take.  But I was able to see him yesterday and obviously take instructions as to his response and to obtain -- these are difficult issues, I know you would appreciate that.  Difficult decisions have to be made by the Defence in these situations.  And his position is essentially this: that he has taken the view that since his arrest for some six months in Namibia 1995, 1996 and his being released thereafter, Mr. Goldstone (phonetic) wrote to the Namibian authorities and said they had no interest at that time in Rwamakuba, on behalf of the OTP, that since then he feels -- and this is his view, I stress -- that he's been the subject of manipulation by the Prosecution and this has caused him to be concerned and to take concerned views, including absence.  But he's still keenly interested in his case and also concerned that, through me, he conveys to you, the Judges, his keen awareness of your responsibilities and duties and in no way wants his absence today or any other day to be seen in any way as any implication raised against you.  He's concerned that he wants the truth to out, as he told me, and he asked me, "How will the Judges know the truth about me?"  He says, "I believe the severed trial is the Prosecution's short cut to try to convict me.  They've manipulated my trial", and he refers to both -- the severance motion he put in, the Kamuhanda case that he attempted to join, and the Butare case.  And he says finally, "I'm sorry, I cannot accept this manipulation by the Prosecution.  I ask the Judges to look with care at my situation."  

So it's plain in those words how he responds to this application and that's a significant matter at a so -- later stage of this case, and he feels his interests lie with not the longer trial, as my friend puts it, but the trial where the matters will be viewed, not through the narrow aperture that's being moulded by the Prosecution here but, rather, the broader picture that he can access when on this existing proposal, the proposed indictment, he still referred to as the government minister, the member of the interim government, the organiser of the Interahamwe, et cetera, et cetera. 

There is prejudice, finally, to this severance application being upheld, and I won't again go through what those matters are.  They are set out in the -- in our response, and they essentially come down to three matters.  

First of all, there will be a trial, if the Prosecution has its way, on an indictment that we do not view with confidence, reflects what the Prosecution maintain in their written motion for severance.  We do not agree that it's narrower and, there, I'm afraid, due to a breakdown of our facilities yesterday, I was not able to get to you annex A -- annex A is now available to you -- and demonstrates -- well, is in effect the indictment that we proffered to the Prosecution earlier in order to say, look, if what you're saying about severance in your motion is right, um, before we go and take instructions about it, we -- if I can use something of a colloquialism -- to be put in our motion.  Put your indictment where your mouth is, let's see it.  And that, in fact, is our interpretation of the indictment if it conformed with what the Prosecution maintain is their position, but that's been rejected, so that's filled us with even more increased anxiety as to the so-called restrictions of the indictment.  And the Prosecution say this indictment is a great benefit to Rwamakuba.  After all, we've gone from 11 counts down to four, or effectively two.  Perhaps the Prosecution should consider doing that in all its cases because all we've been confronted with for years is overloaded, wordy indictments.  And as far as Rwamakuba is concerned, if at the end of the day he's convicted on two counts, two life sentences don't make a lot of difference to six life sentences.  So his interests still need to be earnestly protected in that regard.  We still don't know the final witness list; we still don't know if an expert is to be called; what that expert evidence will go to.  So all that's tied in there in terms of our concern and the inadequacy of the Prosecution's application in this respect.  So concern about where we will be left with, and a concern that we'll be left in a no different position really in practice than we would be with the existing indictment, it's a false carrot, we say, and we're not going to bite it if we can avoid it.

And then, of course, following from that, because of the risk of a broader picture, there are of course wider issues that can, in fact, enter into -- or, will enter into a severed trial.  The Defendant for his part will also loose the opportunity of exploring issues with witnesses that he knows at the moment will be called in the joint trial which will be denied him and he can't call them as a defendant because of the situation.  An example of that is given of Kambanda, and I don't go into that in more detail, but this is a genuine reflection of the background of the preparation of the case, expectation of the defendant and his representatives to explore issues to the advantage of the Accused within a joint trial which will be denied and denied very, very late in the day, and possibly never regained, but certainly a complete frustration of expectations in that respect.  

As I say, I don't think anything I've said is new.  It's all there in our motion, which I hope assists you.  And on behalf of André Rwamakuba, we invite the Court to resist this application for severance.  Again, it is all too much and too late.  

Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Hooper.

Yes, Mr. Roach.  
MR. ROACH:
I want to take a look at the clock and see if my advocacy would be faithful to the time that I estimated, about five minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We think that we should take a break at about eleven o'clock. 

MR. ROACH:
Yes, well, I should be finished by then.  

Well, in our submission in writing, you can see the way we dealt with matters.  And it was not my intention to reiterate in my presentation to you now what we do have here in our submission.  However, with respect to the manner of the general method of proceeding, there's some difficulties that arise because, well, we have dealt and focused with what we call a severance and not the logical point, in our view, of departure should be, and that is the question of what is the effective indictment.  

Now, I will urge this Court not to get into a consideration as to whether or not the indictment of February 2004 is tainted by bias or not tainted by bias, even if my friend, Mr. Webster, is right that the ratio of the -- the decision of the Appeals Tribunal was abuse of judicial discretion.  There's no question that an element was -- or, an element of apprehension of bias, and once there is that there, there is going to be a lot of contention, and you will not find any concurrence in any thinking at all of using or salvaging anything at all from the aborted trial.  And so -- unless there was consent, I cannot see how we would not be wallowing in contention.  

Now, we were asking: is it a fact that once there's an order for a trial de novo all decisions made by the Court whose decision has been overturned for -- well, I would have thought that that would have been pretty logical because what is a trial de novo?  You start from the beginning.  And if you start from the beginning, logic tells us that everything that has to be considered relevant in the trial has to be considered by the new panel without being fettered in their discretion in any way, shape or form; your hands must be free.  And that means that if the Prosecutor wants to have certain positions which he felt helpful, he has to refile his motions and he has to make his arguments and it has to be from the beginning again.  Things have to be done correctly even though a practical way may be to make some short cuts.  We cannot do that.  

The last point I should like to make has to do with the severance, which dominated our discussion this morning so far.  And so far as severance is concerned, we associate ourselves with the position of counsel for Rwamakuba, but, in addition, where there's a real impact on our case and our defence, if there's severance, we believe that the potential is real, that there will be delay in commencing the case against the remaining three because it's the same Prosecution team, it's the same courtroom space that we're going to be using.  We say there's going to be a greater use of our resources, Defence resources, Prosecution resources, Court Management resources.  And although it should be a mathematical reality, or there should be some mathematical formula that would tell us exactly whether more time would be taken or less time would be taken by two trials, we don't have all the information to feed into that formula; for example, we don't know how many common witnesses we would be having.  We know about the specific witnesses, but we don't know about the opinion witnesses or the expert witnesses.  And we're not being given that information.  It would be difficult for us to make a decision as to whether more or less time would be taken if we had severance.  

And there's one thing that Your Honours most likely realise, and that is that there's a level of collaboration between the various Defence teams.  And we are, for example -- consider what areas of expertise, insofar as special witnesses, expert witnesses, are going to be presented, that each of our parties need to concentrate on.  And we haven't in the past made arrangements that one or other of the counsel would concentrate on a particular witness who is known to be an expert and who -- there's a great body of writing out there, and so on, and whose work we have to examine very carefully.  So it does help in carrying the load if we are (unintelligible) together in this one and single trial.  

Those are the points I should make at this point. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Roach. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, would you like me to take my minute at this time? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you have three minutes.  

I'm sorry, Mr. Weyl. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, thank you for giving me the floor.  Mr. President, Your Honours, I would like to delve up a few additional comments on behalf of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  They will be brief, my comments.  

Essentially, I will refer to the briefs that were submitted -- filed in his name, both under the separation motion, but also because you raised this issue with the Prosecutor in respect of the brief that we filed in November and October on the motion current to which he was not deferring, but the way he asked, he requested the amendment of the indictment.  I'm talking about the brief of last September.  So we will refer to the written procedure that was framed in the two motions.  I would like to make a few comments on principle that have been touched on by my colleagues.  I would like to say here that I'm one of the last witnesses of the status conference of 8 February 2002, and during which the Prosecutor had indicated that he will request for leave to amend the indictment, but that in no case he would take -- make arrangements that would delay the course of justice, that would delay commencement of the trial, or that would complicate the task of the Tribunal, that was in February 2002.  And today we have just seen what can be qualified as a disaster systematically.  And it is when the trial is about to commence that the Tribunal is submitted a request for leave to amend an indictment.  

The Prosecutor applied for leave to amend the indictment, this began in January 2004.  This began again when the Tribunal convened us to resume the proceedings on the 3rd of October.  A few days before the 3rd of October, the Prosecutor filed a new application for leave to amend the indictment no doubt in order to delay the time, to make things difficult for us, and to correct things on the basis of the difficulties that he had when he had to face it the first time around.  So we are saying that all that is sought to bring into effect was annulled by the decision of the Appeals Chamber.  

You convened us on the 12th of November.  On the 12th of November, you were asked to review a motion for separation for Mr. Rwamakuba, not for the others.  And I think we have to exercise vigilance in making sure -- in looking at what the Prosecutor files to you and which also concerns us.  And, systematically, he is doing all to force us and to force you to work in a hurry, to work under urgent conditions, and by telling you what is, for instance, the feat of your previous motion -- when you asked him what is the feat of your previous motion, he says it stays, but at the same time it is allowed, that it doesn't comply with the position of the Appeals Chamber.  So, Mr. President, whatever your decision is, if you send us back to the previous motion, we will make another application for the amendment of the indictment.  

So these are the conditions under which we've been working, and these are the conditions under which we're trying to put the Defence in the vice of the time limits that are imposed on you and that is imposed on us, and this is systematic; that is, the Prosecutor is trying to systematically put the Trial Chamber before a (unintelligible), and six years and a half later we are still at the same stage.  Six and a half years later you're being told that we of the Prosecution are not ready to submit an indictment that holds, that can enable us to work.  This is not serious.  And the (unintelligible) history, the manner in which the Prosecution is carrying on is, in my mind, has little to do with the stakes in this Tribunal.  

I will conclude, Mr. President, by making a few indications relating to the application for separation of severance.  This brings to mind a Horacio parable.  The Prosecutor has had lots of difficulties in imposing division or conflict amongst the various counsel.  And I think the idea of separating Mr. Rwamakuba's trial from the rest was in order to assort division amongst the counsel, but this hasn't worked.  He was hoping that he was going to obtain guilt on a case-by-case basis and, in this light, he's been trying to divide us, and I think that's the only reason for applying for separation and for his doing so, so late, but you will not succeed here.  This is another, you know, attempt that the Prosecutor is trying to make.  
And I will make my last comment here.  The Prosecutor has pointed out to you -- well, as far as I'm concerned, before your Court today -- he told you that if you had separation, in any case, it will be the same Chamber that will be addressing the case of the three Accused, Karemera, Nzirorera and Ngirumpatse, and that in separating Rwamakuba's case -- well, this will divide and weaken the Defence, given the solidarity that is showed (sic) proof of over the past years, and I think this will only be an apparent severance since it is still the same Trial Chamber that we're looking at the two files.  And I think this is contrary to what happened in a previous case.  

So, Mr. President, Your Honours, I think that I can be in a position to ask you not to go along the lines suggested by the Prosecutor in what seems to be today a last attempt by the Prosecutor to breed confusion in the indictment against the Accused because they were arrested some six and a half years ago.  So we cannot change things on the basis of the caprices of the Prosecutor.  And thank you for your attention.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Weyl. 

I think now it's about six minutes past 11.  Yes, we can resume at 11:30. 
(Court recessed at 1110H) 
(Pages 24 to 32 by Roxane Lane)



















(Court resumed at 1135H)
   MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I think we can resume now, Mr. Robinson.
   MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the Trial Chamber.  With respect to severance, 
Mr. Nzirorera and I prefer that the status quo be maintained.  We feel that we benefit greatly from the advocacy of Mr. Hooper, Professor O'Shea, as you have seen demonstrated here today, and so we ask that you leave us our legal bulldog to fight our case.

Thank you.
   MR. PRESIDENT:
      Thank you.
   MR. SOW:
Mr. President, Your Honours.  Mr. President, as far as severance is concerned, Karemera's Defence had sent to the registry a letter to advise you that our client, Karemera, was not able to appreciate the Prosecutor's motion, especially as he did not have the French version.  However, in the motion that the Prosecutor filed with you to amend the indictment concerning Mr. Karemera, the Prosecutor did argue about the proposition for severance.  Now, this allowed us, in the motion filed with you on the 23rd November, to also expatiate upon it.

We believe that we must recall, Mr. President, that we have a status conference and on the 
17th of November the year 2004, you yourself said, and I quote you according to the transcript of 
17th November, page 10, that was; "That one cannot have a trial without an indictment."  Hence, the first problem is to determine the existence of an acceptable indictment.  This is a prerequisite for the commencement of the trial.

You insisted so emphatically, that you will call upon the Prosecutor to review his copy on the basis of the indictment, not of the 18th of February, but of the 21st of November the year 2003 -- I am sorry, 2001.

Now, in a quest for a solution, you turned to the Defence, and you asked whether it was not possible, on the basis of the timeframe, pursuant to Rule 72, that we accepted to give up the 30-day limit and take a shorter deadline.  Now, I see this morning, that the Prosecution is sticking to his guns.

Mr. President, therefore, Your Honours, there comes a problem of proceedings, a procedural problem.  Now, my question is, the severance procedure that is within the ambit of this Chamber, isn't it too premature -- isn't it too premature?  How are we going to determine or catalyse this type of proceeding?  If you look at Rule 72 of the Rules, you will realise that severance is part of preliminary motions.  Now, the question I was asking myself was to know whether this was not a way of circumventing the powers of a sole judge that is responsible for the status conference.

Now, if you put in a motion to modify the amendment, the amendment is addressed to you, but it is the Chamber that is being requested to make an announcement thereon.  It's the Chamber that is requested to make a pronouncement so that the status conference Judge can no longer use his powers pursuant to Rule 50 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  To my mind, therefore, I would argue that one cannot talk about severance for the time being -- for the time being, because we are still at a beginning of a trial that recommences tabula rasa. Therefore, the indictment should come in, and the indictment, even if I take in the logic of the Prosecutor, who will say that he is using the indictment of the 30th of February, I believe still that he should remember that this indictment is a joinder indictment.
   MR. PRESIDENT:
      I am sorry for that.  You may proceed now.
   MR. SOW:
Most obliged, Mr. President.  So, since he is using a joint indictment that was accepted on the basis of a decision that was not called into question at the time, he cannot, unless he believes that those decisions are no longer valid, he can't run away from himself by coming in with two indictments -- separate indictments.  And, let me add that the severance procedure such as prescribed, is based on saving time and money, essentially.  Of course, there is a reduction of the number of indictments, but this doesn't satisfy Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, because Rule 48 says that even if the crimes or the charges are not the same, once they form part and parcel of the same criminal enterprise, the joinder should stay.

Now, the argument concerning the reduction of the number of charges also will fail, because it doesn't say that there must be coherence in the decisions thereof, and as far as that is concerned, there is a jurisprudence that we allude to in our motion.  I shall not dwell on it.  In other words, Mr. President, this is the equation.  What is basic?  Is it an indictment that is given to a sole judge to the Chamber to determine the basis on which the trial should continue or are we talking about giving supremacy to severance?  We believe that severance procedure, if it is accepted, will be putting us in a position in which we will no longer even be able to think that there should be an initial appearance.  These are the reasons why I am saying that it is a premature matter and the Prosecutor should be asked to go away and better prepare himself.

Now, as far as the indictment of 18th February is concerned, the preceding speakers have said so, and we have reiterated this.  A trial that starts de novo goes to square one so that the indictment of 18th February was looked into by the three Judges and the decisions of the 27th -- 28th September and 28th October, I believe, determine that the Judges were partial.  Therefore, we do not think that it is necessary.  It is quite unknown, as a matter of fact, for purposes of exigencies of impartiality, because today one established Chamber has resolved issues of partiality, or otherwise, you yourself, Your Honour, Mr. President, you are faced with the exigency of partiality or bias that must be the basis of the entire trial, and this is the reason why I believe that the only indictment that is valid and  that has not been looked into by the former judges, is the indictment of the 20th of November, the year 2001, hence the trial could be seen to be equitable, and you said so, Mr. President, the last time you sat.  But if you are relying on the 18th of February indictment, it means that there are no longer any charges.  This is what it says.  If there are no more charges, the Defence cannot use the provisions of Rule 72.  It is just as though the trial continued.  This is one thing the Prosecution is trying to do and hence the trial is no longer equitable, and as you know, the exigency of impartiality is -- buttresses an inequitable trial.   And from that vantage point, therefore, I believe that we should take it that the indictment, such as separately filed is not justifiable, is not justified, and the Prosecutor must come back with a new indictment.

Now, what are the measures to be taken to that effect?  First of all, I am praying, Mr. President, 
Your Honours, to declare severance inappropriate and to deny that motion.

Secondly, to determine that the new indictment must be based on the indictment of the month of November, the year 2001, and I pray that you give a time limit to the Prosecutor to come in with a new indictment pursuant to Rule 50, that refers to Rule 47, that allows you and gives the pass to do so.

As president of the status conference, you could have done that, but you could have noticed that the two motions were sent directly to the Chamber, and that delayed the trial, whereas you had the same power, sir, as the judge -- as a soloist judge.  I am most obliged, Mr. President. 
   MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Sow.  Mr. Sow, you submitted that if your proposition that the valid indictment was the 2001 indictment -- was accepted, it would be necessary to order the filing of a new application.  But we want to inquire whether if that submission was accepted, why couldn't the court consider this submission relative to that indictment?
   MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I indeed prayed that for as long as the indictment such as introduced was not commensurate with the decisions of the Appeal Chamber of the 28th September to 22nd October, it was a matter of the Chamber perusing that on the basis of a new application of the Prosecutor pursuant to Rule 50.  But I simply wanted to point out that if you called the status conference, it was to accelerate proceedings, so that the same judges could peruse the indictment, and the new provisions of Rule 50 gives you that leave -- that possibility and I could not understand why in spite of that, the Prosecution persists in trying to maintain indictment and directly to the Chamber which calls you to call for a meeting of the Chamber to make a decision, but since the Chambers states there is no problem for the Chamber making a pronouncement on those motions, sir.
   MR. PRESIDENT:
      Thank you very much.  
      
      Yes, Mr. Webster?
   MR. WEBSTER: 
If you would permit me, Your Honour, I would like to respond, briefly, to some of the submissions of the Defence on this issue.  I have several questions for them.
   MR. PRESIDENT:
      We are ready to hear you now.
   MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  Let me begin by saying, Your Honour, that we take us back to the 11th of November when the Court asked us for suggestions for an agenda for the status conference, and we all submitted.  At the top of my list was an indication that I had hoped that we would be able to resolve the motion to severance of our separate indictments on a consensual basis that there would be some consensus that during the course of discussion, that the Defence and the Prosecutor would get together and decide what was in the best interest of the trial.  So when we filed our motion to sever, quite frankly, I was not anticipating a contradictory debate because from our perspective, it is so clearly in the interest of the Defence to move forward in separate trials.  The issues will be narrowed both for 
Mr. Rwamakuba and for the other three.  Looking back over the history of the past year or even before, it simply seems to be in the interest of justice and in the interest of all of the parties to move forward in separate trials.  So I simply was not expecting the level of debate in opposition to our motion that we have seen today and in the motion papers.

So having said that, let me now deal with what the Defence now sees or have articulated as their opposition.  The question for the Chamber is, in spite of this objection from the Defence, is it in the interest of justice to rule against their application and to order a separate trial?  And I would persist and I would say yes, it's still in the interest of justice, Your Honour.

Responding to Mr. Hooper, I am simply repeating what I have said earlier.  Rule 72 is simply not applicable.  Rule 72 governs Defence motion, Defence preliminary motion.  The question of timing is simply not in the ball court for us today, because even if we file an amended indictment and attempted to amend the indictment of the 21st of November 2001, which is where all of the Accused are suggesting to us, the minute we file that amendment or the minute the Court issues a decision on that, it triggers the time limits of Rule 72 and we would automatically fall within the time prescription.  So, the question of timing is simply not going to help us in addressing the issue.

	1200H
MR. WEBSTER:
In terms of what --
MR. PRESIDENT:
If I may just inquire.  How do you interpret -- how do you interpret Rule 72(A)(iii)? 
MR. WEBSTER:
72(A)(iii) is the motion that the Defence would file if, after having received either the indictment or the amendment, they, in the interests of advancing their case, would suggest to the Trial Chamber that justice would be served by severing the indictment for a separate trial or  severing the counts on the indictment.  These are the Defence motions.  The operative rule under Rule 72(A)(iii) is Rule 82.  
Rule 82(B) is what is governing the issue, the issue that is before this Court.  And what Rule 72 does is tell the Defence that they have 30 days within -- after having received the supporting materials on the indictment is the window of time that is available to them to file a motion for severance.  

If we look at 72(A)(i), it's a motion that would allow the Defence to challenge jurisdiction.  The Prosecutor never needs to challenge jurisdiction of his own indictment.  72(A)(ii), to allege defects in the form of the indictment, the Prosecutor would not allege defects in form in the indictment that he has drafted.  72(A)(iii), which is where the Court directed me, this is when the Defence, or the Accused, looking at the indictment that we have filed against him, wants to suggest to the Court that he has a conflict of interest with the other co-Accused or that he was improperly joined.  It's a Defence motion.  

We get to 72(A)(iv), "Raise objections based on the refusal of a request for assignment of counsel made under Rule 45(C)," that is certainly not a Prosecution motion.  The whole schema of Rule 72 is to govern the first set of motions that would move a case forward once an indictment has been confirmed or amended.  

And, bearing that in mind, if we accept the reasoning of the Defence, what they are suggesting to us in term of its practical implications, is that once we filed another -- they are claiming that our amendment of the 18th of February 2004 is not valid, that we should re-file an amended indictment -- our motion to amend on the basis of the indictment of 21 November 2001.  If we do that, the minute the Court rules on it, all of these time periods are triggered again and it gives us, if their reading of the Rule is correct, we would have our 30 days in which to file the 82(B) motion.  We don't need Rule 72 to file that motion; we rely on Rule 73, and we rely on Rule 82(B) itself.  

And we ask the Court to rule in our favour because it is in the interests of justice to do so.  It is in the interests of a good administration of the trial.  We don't expect to obtain a strategic advantage.  All we are trying to do is organise what has come to be a very problematic litigation in the best way possible, so that the evidence comes in smoothly, so that the Defence can raise their defences in an orderly way, in a focused way, so it is actually to benefit the parties and the Chamber.  There is no strategic advantage in splitting the case in two.  It is for practical reasons because we want to do the best job possible, not simply for the Defence, but for the trial and for justice and to comport with our mandate.  

If we have witnesses coming back and forth, I mean, that's an issue for the Court as well.  What is the impact of this lengthy litigation for the witnesses that have to come here and sit through 
cross-examinations from four parties?  When effectively, to assess their credibility and the substance of their proof, it can be handled from a cross-examination from one party and a separate trial for Rwamakuba, or a cross-examination from three Accused and a separate trial for the other Accused.  So it's for purely practical reasons. 

Now, Mr. Hooper was quite accurate, and I have no trepidation in acknowledging that the Prosecutor has shifted his position between July of 2000 and November of 2004.  And we would be foolish if we didn't attempt to make a re-evaluation of how we have been working and how the Tribunal has been functioning on the basis of our historical experience of the last four years.  When we filed those motions for joinder and when we proposed an indictment against 30 people, we did so because we thought that was the best way to proceed.  We thought it was in the interests of the Tribunal, in the interests of our case, in the interests of a fair adjudication of the issues, that it would be -- present a most favourable condition for the witnesses, for witness security, et cetera, et cetera.  We made the best decision that we could with the limited knowledge that we had at the time.  But experience and history has taught us differently, and having gone through the Butare trial or being midway in the Butare trial, having completed the Cyangugu trial, having completed the Media trial, and looking how the trials of Niyitegeka and Kajelijeli and Kamuhanda have progressed rapidly and fairly in comparison to these joint accused trials, now is the opportunity for us to use the benefit of hindsight and organise ourselves in a way that is more effective.  And that's the only reason we wish to proceed in this manner. 

In terms of providing the Defence and the Court with a clear perspective of what lies ahead in two separate trials, I disagree with Mr. Roach's submission.  We went to great lengths to include in our submission of the severance motion an annex C, which listed the witnesses that would be called to testify in the Rwamakuba separate trial.  There are 20 witnesses listed there.  There are summaries of their testimony, there is the anticipated length of their testimony.  In fact, that entire submission -- and I am referring now to annex C -- is what we would intend to file in a pre-trial brief for a separate trial, and we did that deliberately so that all the parties and the Trial Chamber could see exactly what lies ahead in terms of a separate trial for Rwamakuba, so they have a clear idea, Rwamakuba and the others have a clear idea of what witnesses would be called and they have all of the disclosures for those witnesses.  

With respect to the other three Accused, it's the same situation.  We filed with court management and with the Chamber and with the parties an annex A to our submission on disclosure, and we deliberately grouped the witnesses in a way that would clearly indicate to the parties what witnesses would be called for which Accused.  And that same annex A, which everyone has, details the same witnesses in our annex C for Rwamakuba, the same 20 witnesses, and for the other three Accused, we have grouped them, witnesses against Nzirorera, witnesses primarily, primarily against Nzirorera, primarily against Ngirumpatse, primarily against Karemera, and the common witnesses.  So it's clear, the 20 witnesses for Rwamakuba that would be excised from the global listing of 80 and the remaining witnesses that we would call in the separate trial against the remaining three Accused.  So everyone knows what the terrain is ahead, and everyone is in a position to make a reasonable decision whether it's in the interests of justice to proceed on that basis or not. 

Your Honours, before I conclude, I'd like to direct the Court to just two texts, and this is just my humble invitation to the Trial Chamber to look at the Appeals Chamber decision of the 
	8th of April 2004 which responded to challenges from Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera on whether the indictment of the -- excuse me, of the 18th of February was a nullity or not.  

This goes back to an issue that was raised by the Defence right after the Trial Chamber decided our motion to amend.  The Defence's contention was that the Appeals Chamber decision of the 
	19th of December 2003 made the -- put the status of the indictment in question, nullified the previous indictment and threw the trial into conclusion, because the parties did not know what indictment governed the trial.  It's the same situation that Defence is claiming obtains right now: that there's no indictment, that there is a question on the indictment, and the Appeals Chamber responded to that application and ruled against the Defence. 

Now, it's a slightly different issue, but let's just look at how the Appeals Chamber dealt with that issue.  If we look at page 3, and their manner of responding starts with a list of items that they take into consideration, and where I'd like the Court to focus its attention is on the second to last paragraph where it says "considering."  It starts by, "Considering that the 19th of December decision did not contain any" --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. Webster, could you kindly slow down. 
MR. WEBSTER:
"Considering that the 19th of December decision did not contain any pronouncement regarding the validity of the then-operative indictment, but rather decided only that the Trial Chamber applied an incorrect analysis in dismissing the Prosecution's proposed amendments," and it goes on.  

The second to last paragraph at the end of the decision says "finding."  "Finding that the 19th of December decision did not declare the operative indictment at trial to be a nullity and did not deprive the Trial Chamber of jurisdiction to conduct the proceedings on the basis of that indictment," then it goes on make its decision.  

And the point I am making here is that the Appeals Chamber told the parties, back on the 
8th of April 2004, that when it wanted to pronounce on whether an indictment was a nullity or not, it said so explicitly, and it did not say so explicitly in its decision of the 19th of December 2003, which is why the parties should not have drawn the conclusions or made the arguments that they did when they were contesting the validity of that indictment.  And I would invite this Court to read more carefully the passages that I have just cited and look at the way the Trial Chamber addresses the issue of what its orders mean.  It did not say in its decision on the 22nd of October 2004 that all indictments -- that the indictment or all decisions of the Trial Chamber were a nullity.  It simply addressed itself to the narrow issue of whether the two remaining Judges, their decision of 16 July 2004, whether it should stand or not.  It did not address the issue of prior decisions of the Trial Chamber or the status of the indictment.  It took a very narrow view of those issues.  And I am submitting to this Court that it should adopt that perspective in looking at the Appeals Chamber decision of the 22nd of October.  

I'd also like to invite the Court to look at Rule 15 --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster.
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just for purely argumentative purposes --
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry?
MR. PRESIDENT:
I said for purely argumentative purposes, the Appeals Chamber's decision did not have an express ruling on the commencement de novo of the trial. 
MR. WEBSTER:
That's correct. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Why would we be entitled to attribute that to that decision?
MR. WEBSTER:
Because we would look at Rule 15 bis (C), Your Honour.  And if we look at that Rule, and this is -- this was the issue that they were deciding.  I'll read most of that provision, although my concern is mostly in the middle of that paragraph, but 15 bis (C) says, "If, by reason of death, illness, resignation from the Tribunal, non-re-election, non-extension of term of office, or for any other reason, a Judge is unable to continue sitting in a part-heard case for a period which is likely to be longer than of a short duration, the presiding Judge shall report to the President, who may assign another Judge to the case and order either a rehearing or continuation of the proceedings from that point."  

And the word I would like to focus on is "rehearing," because if the framers of the Rule wanted trial to start de novo and wanted to simply erase everything that proceeded trial, proceeded the moment at which the part-heard case had to continue, they could have said "trial de novo," they could have said "a new trial," they could have said -- gone on and elaborated, but they said a rehearing.  And rehearing suggests to me an evidentiary -- questions of an evidentiary nature.  

So my submission to the Court is our focus, in terms of looking at what should survive from the previous trial and what needs to be put aside, are the evidentiary rulings.  The ruling on the indictment, particularly, since it has been affirmed by the Appeals Chamber, it has generated, as has been the object of so much appellate practice already.  There are at least five or six different appellate decisions on the indictment of 18 February 2004 and on the decision of the 13th of February 2004.  It has been ratified by the Appeals Chamber.  

On the basis of those submissions, and when we look carefully at the framing of Rule 15 bis (C), and if we look at how the Appeals Chamber has addressed this issue before in other decisions, I would like to encourage this Court to make a distinction between the decision of the 13th of February 2004, which allows us to amend the indictment, and other decisions of an evidentiary nature that would necessarily have to be set aside in order for a rehearing of the case to occur. 

I don't want to lengthen these proceedings unnecessarily, because everything that I could say now in response to the Defence now, I've said already in my preliminary submission and it has been said in writing and it has been communicated to the Court in our status conferences, so I'll attempt to conclude now.  But I'd like this Court to consider the volume of appellate decisions on this very issue of the amended indictment and the way in which those decisions ratify the decision of the Trial Chamber of the 13th of February and then the language that we use to address these issues that has been provided to us by the Judges in plenary when they amended Rule 15 bis and the Appeals Chamber when it decided a previous issue that was somewhat similar so the issue that we now confront.  

The only thing I'd like to add is perhaps in part a comment or response to the question that Mr. Sow just answered which ties in with the question that the Court itself posed to me earlier today, and that is, what is the status now of the Prosecutor's motion of the 10th of September if the Court were minded to rule against us on the severance.  Now, if the severance motion is denied, and of necessity the motion to amend of the 19th of November is denied, then we come back to our application of the 10th of September, which is to amend the indictment against the four Accused, which is the indictment of the 18th of February, which is the indictment that we suggest is the operative instrument.  And once the Court is willing to acknowledge that that indictment, the amendment of the 18th of February, is a valid instrument and is currently operative, then it can rule on that motion.  If the Court decides that the indictment of the 18th of February cannot obtain, and that it is only the indictment of the 21st November 2001 that can be the focus of deliberation, our motion has to be re-filed, because we have not motivated that motion to respond, to amend, the indictment of November 2001.  And what the Appeals Chamber has already told us in its decision of 19 November 2003 is, we have to demonstrate diligence; we have to demonstrate the legal sufficiency.  The amendments to the Rule that have been introduced subsequent to that application tell us that we have to provide supporting material, and we haven't done that, because our position all along has been that there are no new charges; it's the indictment of the 18th of February that governs us, and if that's not the case, then we have to re-file our applications to amend.  So that's the practical ramification of how this Court will decide the severance motion.  

And, having said that, I again place myself at your disposal.  If there's anything ambiguous in my application, I'd appreciate this opportunity to respond to you directly so that anything I can do to assist the Court in its deliberation of the issue, I can do right here as we speak.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster. 

Well, we'd like to thank you all for the thoroughly interesting presentations on the matter at hand.  We will take the matter under further consideration, and we are anticipating that we'll be able to deliver our final ruling on this matter by the end of next week.  

Yes, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry if I have interrupted you, Mr. President.  For my part and for members of this Defence team, I will be here in Arusha next week.  I don't know how other Defence teams are situated in respect of availability, but in any event, there are matters here that quite clearly concern Rwamakuba well over the interests of others.  And so in those circumstances, I am wondering if the Court would be assisted, as it may be that we might, if the Court were in fact to set a time for next week when we could meet here -- may be an oral decision -- and hear the decision orally and perhaps address any matters that may arise from that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, are you indicating -- do I undertake -- do I understand that all the Defence teams will have a presence here next week? 
MR. HOOPER:
I can't speak for other Defence teams, but I certainly can be here.  I am unclear as to how others are situated in respect of that.  But I see, with respect, I see no reason, as they all have lead and 
co-counsel why such a facility can be arranged.  Having said that, I know Mr. Robinson has not got co-counsel, which I know Mr. O'Donnell has regularly berated him about.  I don't join that argument, and I don't know what his position is, so I don't speak for anybody else.  But I do make the obvious point that we are particularly concerned about some aspects of the decision.  And I will be here in any event.  That's the point I make.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Sow.
MR. SOW:
Yes, Mr. President.  I wanted to ask you if the status conference for tomorrow is still scheduled so that we know whether or not we need to be present.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
There's a short answer, which is yes. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  In the event you are still considering proceedings for next week, I would like to advise you that I am scheduled to be in another trial chamber for ICTY on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of next week, but would be happy to return on the following Monday, if that would be of assistance.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is anybody else willing to indicate their availability?
MR. ROACH:
I am certain that that would be possible for our team to be here sometime next week. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, regrettably, I will not able to be present next week.  We did everything possible according to the calendar that was given to us, and you know, of course, the implications of me not being here what those will be for the Trial Chamber.  Thank you, Mr. President. 

MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I simply wanted to tell you that, regrettably, we are totally unavailable next week.  With regard to the calendar or schedule that was given to us initially, there were two status conferences, for the 17th and the 24th of November.  Today is the 25th of November.  We have very difficult problems being here next week, and I just wanted to point that out to you.  Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, we wonder whether it would be -- whether it would be in good sense to schedule a hearing if only some of the Accused could be present and represented.  For the purposes of our decision delivery, it is not necessary for a hearing.  We can deliver our decision in writing.  Was there any special reason that would make a hearing necessary for your team only? 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, if the Court were moved by the Prosecution motion to order severance, then there may be matters that would be particular to this team that we would want to put before the Court.  And if there was severance ordered, then that presumably would not affect co-Accused.  And if, when we were here, if a situation arose where there were submissions that need to made in respect of this team, I can indicate that they would not conceivably affect other Accused, and I couldn't see how they would, then I would have thought in those circumstances, I would have thought no objection could possibly reasonably arise.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I --
MR. HOOPER:
From Defence, that is.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I understand that, and we will take note of that position.  And what we could do is that if that in fact was going to be the disposition of the Court, we could then include arrangements for an audience for Rwamakuba if that was in fact required by our decision. 
MR. HOOPER:
The practicalities of it are, that if that's flagged up, then it certainly may -- I'm here in any event, but it may help others -- I think Mr. O'Shea, possibly.  

But in any event, there have been particular pressures placed on this team over the last days since we've been here, which have meant that there are quite a lot of matters that we should have properly been attending to that have gone to the side.  So that would greatly assist us generally, and I hope also in the long run assist the Court.  If it happened to be the situation, as Your Honours indicated, that it may be that it be subject, of course, to Your Honours' decisions, then an opportunity for 
Your Honours, as it were, to address the situation next week.  Otherwise, it would mean us going away and perhaps having to come back and all the inconvenience that gives rise to.  So I am assisted by what Your Honour said.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will try to be as expeditious as we can.  It is unlikely that we'll be in a position to give any indication before Tuesday or Wednesday of next week.  That's the earliest possible date, I would think.
MR. HOOPER:
I am very grateful to Your Honour.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The point has just been raised, but I think we probably could discuss it tomorrow, some preliminary discussions on future scheduling, so one could identify -- get some sense as to what is possible as we make plans for the continuation of this matter.  

An agenda was circulated this morning, and I gather that a few other legal issues have arisen on which there is an interest in some further discussion.  The first issue had to do with the application of Rule 68 of the Rules, and I gather the Prosecutor had a special submission he wished to put to that.
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't know if it is a special submission, but we definitely would like to inform the Court of how we'd like to approach the amended Rule 68.  I am going to hand the floor to my associate, 
	Greg Lombardi, who will address that point, and other points that other members of the team will address as the hearing progresses. 
MR. LOMBARDI:
Good morning, Mr. President and Your Honours.  The first item on the agenda is Rule 68(A).  In the Prosecutor's view, this is directly linked to Rule 68(B) as well.  And so the issue of EDS is a bit further down on the agenda.  I will touch slightly on that in my presentation on this first matter.

67(B), going to that first, allows the Prosecutor to establish an electronic disclosure suite, and as we've indicated previously, efforts to establish that suite have been long under way and are nearing completion.  It's our view that, once established, and once the Defence has access to this suite, that this will put the Prosecutor into substantial compliance with Rule 68(A).  And that is because the material that falls within the definition of 68(A) is but a subset of material that will be in the EDS.  

68(B) talks about collections of relevant material, and that is a much broader category than the material that's referenced in 68(A), which has been defined as material which, in the actual knowledge of the Prosecutor, may suggest innocence or mitigate guilt or affect the credibility of Prosecution evidence.  And I would point out also, in this context, that in fact the material that would be in the EDS will be in fact broader that what 68(B) even requires, because 68(B) speaks of irrelevant material, and in fact the Prosecutor's intention is to put all material in various classes that are going to be in the EDS without regard to whether they are particularly relevant to any one case.  So it's going to be essentially an open file system with some limitations, which I will address presently. 

Even if this system is -- or when this system is in fact implemented, this will not equal compliance with Rule 68(A), and that is because, first of all, while the vast majority of the OTP archives will be in the EDS, they will not all be there.  In particular, Rule 70 material will not be included in the EDS.  And so under Rule 68(A), the Prosecutor will still be obligated to search that material for material that falls within the definition of 68(A).  And I would also point out, probably transcripts of prior testimony will not be in the EDS, and so it will be the responsibility of the Prosecutor to search -- or to make available those transcripts.  

We know from the Appeals Chamber's recent judgement in Blaskic that we are supposed to pay particular attention to the situation arising when the same witness testifies in different trials.  So we are still under an obligation to undertake those efforts.  

And, secondly, if the Prosecutor has actual knowledge that some material may suggest innocence or may affect credibility, we must disclose that under Rule 68(A).  We cannot simply say, "Well, it's in the EDS, and it up to the Defence to go search it out."  If we have actual knowledge that there is a particular document that falls within the definition of 68(A), we must disclose it to them, even if it is in the EDS.  And so, in our view, that interpretation gives meaning to the phrase in Rule 68(B) that it operates, quote, without prejudice to paragraph A.  

Now, the Prosecutor continues to be obligated to disclose under Rule 68(A) only that which it has in its possession.  We're not required, and as Your Honour, Mr. President, was involved in the recent decision in Simba where this was made clear, we're not required to pursue every possible avenue of investigation into a witness's credibility on behalf of the Defence.  For example, if we are aware that there is potentially Rule 68 material in possession of a third party, we are not, under Rule 68(A), by its definition, obligated to get it.  

However, as was noted in that decision, we can become obligated by a Trial Chamber order to go search out that material, using our best of efforts.  For example, with respect to Rwandan TVs, and we were in fact previously obligated to do that in this case.  

And also I would point out that Trial Chamber II has made a similar observation in Bizimungu on a number of occasions, but most recently last week, in which it was stated that we are not obligated to search for materials not in our possession, but that if the Defence has specific knowledge that a particular document exists, and it's not in the Prosecutor's possession, and we are in a better position to get a hold of that material, and they have attempted to get a hold of that material and cannot, then we should use our best efforts, under Rule 68(A), to obtain that material and disclose it to them. 

Now, our interpretation of Rule 68 is consonant with the purpose of amending the Rule, which is to facilitate, in our view, the Prosecutor's compliance with the obligation to disclose exculpatory evidence, given the volume of material that we have in our archives.  

Now, with respect to Rule 68(A) and the change in language that has occurred in that Rule, from what the Rule used to require, there was a discussion of this by counsel for Rwamakuba in one of our earlier working sessions.  The Prosecutor's view is that 68(A) is in fact a narrower definition, when they talk about actual knowledge, that this is a narrower definition of what we're required to disclose than the previous Rule, but that that in itself does not violate the principle that this Rule cannot be interpreted to the detriment of the Accused, because, in our view, you have to look at Rule 68 as a whole, the regime as a whole.  And, in fact, under the new regime the Accused is going to get more disclosure.  The Accused is going to get access, in fact, to a whole range of information that goes beyond what Rule 68 requires.  In practice, they're going to be able to search through that material and to gather more -- in their view, I am sure, more exculpatory evidence than they would have been provided under the former Rule.  So, in effect -- and they're going to find more useful information too, because, if the Prosecutor is complying with Rule 68, the Prosecutor is going to be complying with Rule 68 based on its understanding of the Defence case and its understanding of what is exculpatory to the Defence.  And for obvious reasons, the Defence may not be completely forthcoming about what its case is, and so therefore the material that we would be searching for may not be exactly what the Defence really would find useful.  By using the EDS, they're going to be able to search through the entire body of Prosecution evidence that's there, use their own definition of what is exculpatory, and they're going to be able to get information that's much more useful to them. 

Now, with particular respect to the issue that was raised by counsel for Nzirorera on a couple of occasions, as dealing with disagreements as to what is exculpatory, what falls within the category of Rule 68, our submission is that if there is a particular disagreement, then his remedy is to bring a motion.  And he's already indicated that he would do that.  And there's ample jurisprudence, most recently laid out in the Appeals Chamber's judgement in Blaskic in July as to what he has to do in order to prevail on such a motion.  

So, I can't address -- or I wouldn't address those particular concerns today over disputes as to the scope of disclosure because he hasn't made his motion yet, and if and when he does make that motion, then we would respond to those particular issues. 

That would be my submission for the moment, Mr. President.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Are there any responses? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President and members of the Trial Chamber.  When we discussed this with 
Mr. O'Donnell in our working session, we had categorised this issue as one in which we have to litigate, but now I am not so sure.  The particular problem that we addressed was our request, which has now been longstanding for over a year and a half, that the Prosecutor search his database with respect to his witnesses and that whenever he finds information given by one person contradicting that of one of his witnesses, he had to disclose that information to us, because we believe that that affected the credibility of the witness under Rule 68, and the Prosecutor has maintained that he didn't have to do that and didn't do it.  And so we had none of that material, with the exception of Rule -- with the exception of two witnesses who were handled by a different Prosecutor.  

However, the emergence of the electronic data system, I think will solve that problem to our satisfaction.  If all of the witness statements are put on the electronic data system, even in redacted form, we can ourselves conduct such a search, which, in my view, is even better than having the Prosecutor do it, and so I think that the electronic data system, and once all of the witness statements are loaded on it, will provide the solution for this legal issue of the extent of the Prosecutor's obligation under Rule 68.  

The problem is time, because we don't want to start the trial until we have all that information, so it can be used in our opening statement, in our investigation, and of course during the 
	cross-examination of the witnesses.  And so I leave that problem of time to the wisdom of the 
	Trial Chamber.  But I think that the emergence of the electronic data system provides a system to the legal issue under Rule 68 that was discussed at our working session.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, for -- sorry. 
MR. ROACH:
Yes.  We are very pleased with that development of the EDS.  The fact that information was not being sent to all parties, including co-counsel and counsel who may live in different parts of the world, was a serious problem for our team, and now that we presumably are going to be having access, no matter where we are on the face of the planet, to get information in disclosure, it would certainly put an end to a serious problem that we had in terms of having documentation and hard copy, or even on CDs distributed to the parties.  So we are pleased about this.  And we are just eager now to know about the steps to get this thing in operation so that, as my friend pointed out, the time constraints that we have would be well met.  Thanks.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  For our part, we have been engaged in what we see as a battle for disclosure for certainly the last 18 months, and indeed before that.  If the Chamber is being asked today to make -- and I don't believe it is, but if it were to be asked today to make some -- to give some assistance as to the interpretation of the new Rule, we would raise a doubt as to whether that would really be helpful.  That is to say, seeking to find a rule, hypothetically, as it were, and we'd invite the Court not in fact to go down that path, but only to deal with interpretation as and when a situation arises that demands it.

	1245H
MR. HOOPER:
And any other matter which raises the electronic suite, we would like to reserve judgment on that.  It's pregnant with problems as far as we can see, and as I understand it, it will not be accessible anywhere else but here, and it won't contain witness statements, but that isn't a matter in my submission, that need trouble or engage the Chamber today, but I can see that it is going to be a problem that will need to be addressed as it has been already sought by Mr. O'Donnell in our discussions.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  I think that covers the items 31 and 34 on the agenda.  The next item that was listed for discussion is described as documents to be disclosed under Rule 66(A) of the Rules.  

Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I am going invite my associate Mr. Bongani Dyani to come up to the podium and he will address that issue. 
MR. DYANI:
Mr. President, Your Honours, I greet you.  One of the issues that arose during one of our working sessions was an issue of whether does the Prosecutor have an obligation to disclose emails, letters, or other correspondences from Prosecution witnesses.  

I would like to start addressing this issue by referring to Rule 66, that is the obligations of the -- disclosure obligations of the Prosecutor under this rule.  Under this rule, the material that is supposed to be disclosed by the Prosecution to the Defence are "the copies of supporting material which accompanied the indictment when confirmation was sought, as well as prior statements obtained by the Prosecutor from the Accused." 

Secondly, it is the copies of statements of all witnesses whom the Prosecutor intends to call to testify at trial.  Thirdly, at Defence's request, the Prosecutor shall permit the Defence to inspect any books, documents, photographs and tangible objects in the Prosecutor's custody, which are material to the preparation of the Defence case or are intended for use by the Prosecution as evidence at trial.  

Now, for this Chamber to decide as to whether these are documents that the Defence actually seeks the Prosecutor to disclose, the Chamber had to decide as to whether these documents -- is the Prosecutor obliged under Rule 66 to disclose these documents to the Defence?  To arrive at that conclusion, the Chamber had to decide whether these documents are actually witness written statements.  If these documents are witness written statements, then the Prosecution is obliged to disclose these documents.  But, if these documents are not witness written statements, then the Prosecution is not obliged to disclose these documents.  

It is the Prosecution's submission that he is under no obligation to disclose these documents as this is not Rule 66 material, but material which, in terms of Rule 70, is not subject to disclosure.  In accordance with Rule 66(A) (ii), the Prosecution shall make available to the Defence copies of the statements of all witnesses whom the Prosecutor intends to call to testify at trial.  

The Appeals Chamber in Blaskic emphasised that the usual meaning of witness statements in trial proceedings is an account of a person's knowledge of a crime which is recorded through due to procedure of an investigation into a crime.  

Now, Your Honours, can we say that emails, letters and other correspondence between the Prosecution and Prosecution witnesses is an account of a person's knowledge of a crime which is recorded through due to procedure of an investigation into a crime?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Wouldn't that depend on the content of the correspondence?
MR. DYANI:
Yes, I am coming to that, My Lord. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Or you have a long speech prepared for us? 
MR. DYANI:
I am coming to that, My Lord.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, I am asking you seriously.  I mean, do you intend to make a very lengthy presentation on this matter?
MR. DYANI:
(Microphone not activated) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The last comment did not come through the microphone, I am sorry, Your Honours -- comment from Prosecution. 
MR. DYANI:
The last comment was, I will be through with this within two minutes.  

It is the Prosecution's submission, Your Worship, that the definition of the witness statement in the Blaskic case should be read in conjunction with the Niyitegeka judgment, where the Appeals Chamber distinguished between records that contained questions put to a witness and the answers thereto from internal documents prepared by a party, which are not subject to disclosure under Rule 70.   It is my submission, Your Honours, that this judgment should be read together.  

Now, coming to the emails, correspondence and letters between Prosecution and Prosecution witnesses, these are merely correspondence which are just meant to facilitate the process of the witnesses coming to testify in this trial.  They have got nothing whatsoever in relation to an account by a witness about his knowledge of crimes which had been committed by an accused. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it possible to make that assertion without reading the correspondence?
MR. DYANI:
Your Honours, if these materials were to be said to be material maybe under Rule 68, then the Prosecution has the discretion of making a determination whether that is a disclosable material or not.  

And, Your Honours, the Appeals Chamber had held that -- in Brdjanin held that the Trial Chamber cannot interfere with this discretion.  So we make a discretion that this material is not a disclosable material, and this Chamber cannot interfere with that discretion in terms of Rule 68.  

Your Honours, in terms of these emails and letters, there is no question which is put to a witness and there is no answer from that witness.  In terms of the Niyitegeka judgment, therefore, these correspondences do not fall under either Rule 66 or Rule 68. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Dyani, you did not seem to understand the question I had asked you.  You see, my question really was this:  If something is defined as correspondence, emails, that definition indicates that it does not contain information about the trial and you can make that assertion without reading the material.  Is that your submission?
MR. DYANI:
No, Your Honours, that is not my submission.  But my submission is that that material is protected under Rule 70 and -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, No.  But, my question is this:  If when you read the material, it contains information about statements given, what is the status of that material even if it is in emails or in correspondence?
MR. DYANI:
I get your question now, Your Honour.  In that event, Your Worship, if reading through that correspondence there is material which is exculpatory then as Prosecution, you are obliged to disclose that information to the Defence.  But as it is now --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Don't you think you need to modify your formulation somewhat to accommodate what comes out?  
MR. DYANI:
During the correspondence between the Prosecution and Prosecution witnesses, either in emails or letters, if in the process there is exculpatory material, then that information will be disclosed to the Defence, but as it is now, we don't have such information. 
JUDGE SHORT:
And what if the information in the correspondence is supplemental to the statements already made by the witness?
MR. DYANI:
In terms of Rule 67(D) then that information will be disclosed to the Defence.  As it is now, we don't have such information.  That concludes my presentation, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, with respect to this point, this arises in the context of two ex parte confidential filings that were made by the Prosecutor with respect to its witnesses.  One involved an email sent by a witness complaining about the conduct of investigations by Mr. Nzirorera's Defence team, and the other a statement made by a witness to an investigator in a third country indicating that he refused to meet with the counsel for Mr. Nzirorera, myself.  

It is our position that we would like disclosure of those correspondences and statements for purposes of our cross-examination of those witnesses, and I think the Rule amply provides for us to have that.  I think the operative rule is Rule 66(B), which allows us to have inspection of any books, documents, and these emails and statements are documents which are material to the preparation of the Defence.  And these are material to the preparation of the Defence because they provide further, if you will, for cross-examination as to the bias, fear or attitude of the witness before the witness comes to testify against Mr. Nzirorera.  And so, we believe that it is the type of material that we should at least be afforded inspection of under Rule 66(B), and that the Trial Chamber need not engage in the question of whether this constitutes the statement which would have to be looked at as a case-by-case, document-by-document basis.  

I would further point out that this is not a matter under the Rules -- that falls under the Rule 70 exception to disclosure.  Rule 70(A) says that, "Notwithstanding the provisions of Rule 66 and 67, reports, memoranda or other internal documents prepared by a party, its assistants or representatives in connection with the investigation or preparation of the case, are not subject to disclosure or notification under the aforementioned provisions."  A statement coming from a witness is not prepared by a party, its assistants or representatives, and, therefore, it does not fall within the exclusion of 
Rule 70(A).  That is my submission on this issue.  Thank you. 
MR. ROACH:
Mr. President and Members of the Panel, it should not be easy for the Prosecutor to escape the supervisory role and power of this Court.  If, for example, as has been said there is a document in which the Prosecutor claims to have privilege, a privilege which or discretion which cannot be interfered with by this Chamber, it would be, to my mind, something that would be unusual and this Chamber should have an opportunity to see what it is that is being claimed as beyond the reach of any decision that this Court might make.  So a procedure, maybe a practice procedure, could be developed in which if the Defence knows of a particular document that is claimed to be privileged by the Prosecutor, then this Chamber could be apprised of that, but through a motion, and the matter could be brought to you and give you an opportunity to look at the material and make a decision as to whether or not it could be useful in fairness to an accused person.
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honours, I hope that there is not going to be any ruling at the end of this.  For our part, we don't feel that we really need to go into the legal argument on the interpretation of these rules right now.  We will no doubt at some point put in a motion for disclosure or we will put in a motion for disclosure, and we will consider that carefully before we put it in.  And I suspect that Your Honours are not going to give any rulings at the end of all these discussions, but in that light, we won't enter into the legal argument, but if Your Honours are minded to think about making rulings in the abstract, then please let us know. 
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, I wish to draw your attention to the use of Rule 66 of which we have regularly been a victim in the former trial.  I do know that in this regard we felt that the time limits proscribed in Rule 66 were never respected essentially, and we also felt, Your Honours, that the Prosecution was proceeding by ambush.  It would be important for the new trial to have it ensured that the time limits proscribed by Rule 66(A) are adhered to strictly, and, in my view, it is only in so doing that the trial would proceed lawfully.  And I do hope that the Trial Chamber will ensure that there is strict compliance with the provisions of Rule 66(A), in particular.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Dyani, do you have any comments in response to Mr. Robinson's raising Rule 66(B) as a basis for having access to inspection of the documents he has requested? 

MR. DYANI:
My response to that, Your Honour, will be that these documents do not fall under Rule 66(B).
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have the Rule there? 
MR. DYANI:
Yes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the adjective which limits the documents?  
MR. DYANI:
According to this rule, Your Honour, the Defence may require to inspect books, documents, photographs and tangible objects in its custody.  The argument of the Prosecution is that these documents are not disclosable material because they are protected in terms of Rule 70(A). 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Rule?
MR. DYANI:
They are protected --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you read Rule 70(A).
MR. DYANI:
I read the rule, Your Honour.  "Notwithstanding the provisions of Rule 66 and 67, reports, memoranda or other internal documents prepared by either party, its assistants or representatives in connection with the investigation or preparation of the case are not subject to disclosure or notification under the aforementioned provisions."
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would you say that that Rule could apply to a correspondence written by a witness who was not a party or assistant or representative? 
MR. DYANI:
I consider them protected under internal documents, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But at the time relevant, who prepares the document?  Does the Rule apply to documents prepared by anybody or only by a particular class of people?  
MR. DYANI:
Your Worship, here we are dealing with a correspondence between the Office of the Prosecutor and a witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no.  Mr. Robinson raised a question about a letter prepared by a witness and sent to the office, and I was wondering under which of these categories that person would fall. 
MR. DYANI:
Although, Your Honours, I still maintain that Rule 70 is applicable here, but at  the same time, 
Your Honours, the letters referred to by Mr. Robinson and -- what we have in our possession is a letter -- an email from Witness LAC and a correspondence. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Dyani, I was not attempting to make a specific ruling, but I was just trying to understand the legal basis upon which you are making your submission.  My question is a very simple one.  You see, the rule that you read to me suggested that for the documents to have the protection of Rule 70 they must be prepared by a particular group of persons, and my question was, was that letter prepared by one of the groups protected by Rule 70?
MR. DYANI:
No, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, on what basis then would you say that Rule 70 applies? 
MR. DYANI:
Arguably, Your Honour, it would be Rule 70(B) because this --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you read it?
MR. DYANI:
"If the Prosecutor is in possession of information which has been provided to him upon a confidential basis and which has been used solely for the purpose of generating new evidence, that initial information and its origin shall be disclosed."
MR. PRESIDENT:
 -- shall not.
MR. DYANI:
-- "shall not be disclosed by the Prosecutor without consent of the person or entity providing initial information and shall, in any event, not be given in evidence without prior disclosure to the Accused." 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Obviously, Mr. Dyani, I don't think there is any point in carrying on this discussion any further.  The third point and I think the last point under this heading was the issue relating to experts to be called by the Prosecution.

Is there, Mr. Prosecutor, anything like that?  I am not so sure. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I think some of these agenda items, Your Honour, were really in response to Defence requests and issues that were in controversy during our working sessions.  Perhaps the best way to proceed is to allow the Defence to express their discontent and then we can respond to that.  But if you would permit me, I would like to make just one further comment to supplement the submission of my associate in that.  It is in direct response to Mr. Robinson's complaint because he is addressing two specific items.  It is not a speculative issue for the Court to decide.  I think he mentioned specifically a document that was submitted as part of our motion practice in regard to Witness T.  That document is before the Court.  We filed it with the Court, but we didn't file it with the Accused, and we did that because we thought it was protected by our special protective measures for Witness G and 
Witness T.  But if the Court thinks that this is the type of information the Court is to overrule us because you will have the documents although you will do so over our objections and has bearing on the preparation of the Defence.  

When we look at Rule 66, there is a qualification to what we have to provide inspection for, and it says material to the preparation of the Defence, and that's a determination for the Prosecutor to make in the first instance.  There is Appellate jurisprudence on that.  I think it comes from Blaskic.  We'll decide if we think it is material.  If they counter that initial determination, then they can file a motion, and I am presuming that Mr. Robinson is doing just that because I have stated categorically that we are not disclosing it unless the Trial Chamber forces us to do so.

The second item is an email which I handed up to the Court last Wednesday when we were in a status conference, and it concerns allegations by a witness who was not identified at the time, but it was Witness ALC, that he felt insecure because of the way Defence investigations were proceeding; they were disclosing his identity.  And Mr. Robinson claims that that email, without having read it, is somehow material to his preparation of his defence, and that's a determination that this Court can make because this Court has a copy of that email.  So we defer to your judgment on the issue, but we maintain our position that neither one of those two communications should be disclosed to the Defence. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, my only comment on that is that I am -- I would hope that we would not have to rule on disputes which could be resolved between the parties, and I would expect that if there were answers which should be reached on a perusal of the rules, that it would only be in really -- matters where there were -- was a basis for a bona fide disagreement that you we have to rule.  So I would trust that in matters which are not of such complexity, that the matters will be resolved between counsel on the matter.  I would expect that.
MR. WEBSTER:
With all due respect, Your Honour, for us the issue is not complex, there is no complexity to it.  These are not materials that we are inclined to disclose.  Mr. Robinson seems to think that they are.  It is his complaint and his motion.  We are simply responding to it.  We will provide extensive disclosure.  We have just finished a discussion when we talk about opening up the entire OTP database to the Defence.  We are not inclined to hold anything back.  We are not trying to play games with the Defence or keep information from them, but there is a consideration for witness security and witness's own apprehension or his own sense of security in his person, and these -- every witness I have spoken to, one of the first questions they raised is, "Is my identity going to be disclosed?"  "Will I be protected?"  And whether there is a real threat to them or not, they experience trepidation, and in view of keeping the witness's mind at ease, I don't think it is appropriate to have them subject to cross-examination on bits and pieces of correspondence that have nothing to do with the material issue in this case and nothing to do with witness credibility.  And having said that, I maintain opposition.  We are not disclosing it, but if the Trial Chamber is minded to disagree with that submission, the 
Trial Chamber already has these two specific correspondences and can disclose them to 
Mr. Robinson. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have any comments on the issue of expert witnesses?
MR. WEBSTER:
Perhaps it would be a bit faster to have Mr. Robinson voice his concern and then Mr. Dyani can response to that. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, I am happy to do so.  This issue also arose in our working session and it involves the application of Rule 94 bis.  The problem is that, starting in May or March of 2002, the Prosecutor indicated that the experts who would be called would be preparing their reports shortly and that it would be disclosed when it was prepared.  Since then we have come to the point where the Prosecutor apparently takes the position that it need not ask its witnesses to prepare reports until some time shortly before they testify, which is expected to be at the end of what is maybe a 
two-and-half-year trial.  And, therefore, in the meantime, we are left with thousands of pages of their prior testimony, their reports in other cases, their articles and writings, without any knowledge of what would be the subject of their expert testimony at our trial. 

Now, Rule 94 bis provides that the full statements of any expert witness called by a party shall be disclosed to the opposing party as early as possible and shall be filed with the Trial Chamber not less than 21 days prior to the date on which the expert is expected to testify.  

The Prosecution appears to interpret that as meaning that as long as they filed the record 21 days before the expert is going to testify, there are in compliance with this Rule.  What we are asking is that a deadline be set by the Trial Chamber for the preparation of these reports by the expert witnesses.  They have no deadlines and so they are simply working on other matters and they are not preparing their reports.  As a result, large amounts of money is being spent by this Tribunal, by Defence teams trying to get ready to anticipate what these experts will be testifying about, trying to get our own experts and basically shooting in the dark on this matter.  We think this problem can be solved by some administration of Rule 94 bis by the Trial Chamber, and that would be useful not only to the parties, but to avoid any delays in the future when the experts finally come and testify.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, why did you think that this is a matter suitable for Rule 94 bis rather than the pre-trial conference?  Isn't that something that would normally be addressed in the pre-trial conference under Rule 73 bis (B)(vi)?
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, it certainly is appropriate for discussion at the pre-trial conference.  We were asked in connection with the working session to identify all disclosure disputes and this is one of them, and to me the sooner it is resolved the better, but certainly it is appropriate for the pre-trial conference. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you wish to comment on anything, Mr. Dyani?  
MR. DYANI:
I would suggest that we leave this one for the trial conference, Your Worship.  I think that it can be amicably resolved.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Now, there are just a couple of matters which are described as non-legal issues, and I gather that really they are all raised by Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
I am not entirely sure what those were, but just --
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question of the bundle of exhibits and witness statements of Prosecution, the exhibit bundles and disclosure of maps.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, those are all matters that obviously go to assisting the appropriate presentation of a case and the response of the parties to the case, generally facilitating the conduct of the case, and perhaps I need say no more about it now.  

Similarly, the issue of experts has been raised, if I can just revert to that, and is a matter that obviously merits attention.  We have got a status conference of sorts, whatever tomorrow; there may be others.  We had a pre-trial conference in the vacated trial, but it was on the day before the trial started.  So there is a degree of wariness perhaps on our part.  It's easier to deal with these matters appropriately at the appropriate time before the trial.  I raise no further matters about it.  But, yes, I am quite keen on exhibit bundles and on even statement bundles, and I know at a status conference that was held, presided over by Judge Williams previous to the vacated trial starting, he also expressed, as I recall, a keen interest in that, but nothing came of it.  But perhaps between us we might able to advance that if the Court feels it is appropriate.  

Coming though to the question of expert evidence, it is of particular pertinence to the severance motion, is that inasmuch as evidence in the extent of evidence is relevant to your considerations, there may be a potential handicap both to the Defence in its submissions and to the Chamber in its considerations.  If we don't know the extent the Prosecution is indicating his evidence is going to go, and one particular gap in this is that there is no indication even if an expert witness would be called in a severed trial, but as the Prosecution made that point yesterday or the day before, but more particularly --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, why shouldn't the conclusion be drawn that the witness list submitted contained all the witnesses intended to be called?  
MR. HOOPER:
Because the Prosecution have indicated that they intend or may call an expert witness and an investigator, and that's been their declared intention.  So left with that, and leaving aside the investigator at the moment, who is used really as a hanger to hang photographs and the like on the maps, and the rest of it is we are led to believe still leaves at large, this question of the experts.  Now, if an expert is to be called, and the Prosecution have indicated that one will or might be, then what is that evidence? Which expert is it to be and what are the particular issues that the Crown is seeking to introduce before the Chamber in that evidence, because these experts, the Chamber will appreciate, can sometimes range over a very vague territory indeed, and insofar again as we make that point in our motion, that the extent of the evidence to come and the full extent of the Prosecution case is uncertain, then that reflects of that position.  So that's the point that we seek to make in respect of that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  I think I'd probably better bring our session today to an end.  It is now 1:24.  I don't think that the matters scheduled for tomorrow are likely very lengthy and perhaps this discussion can be concluded at that stage.  So I think it might be appropriate to adjourn our session now and resume tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock.
