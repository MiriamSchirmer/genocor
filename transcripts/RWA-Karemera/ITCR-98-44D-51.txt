P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registry, could you call the case. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, and Judge Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Thursday, 24th March 2005, for a Status Conference in the matter of the Prosecutor vs. Karemera et al., Case Number ICTR-97-44-I.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Appearances, please.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Good morning, Your Honours.  The Prosecution is represented by Don Webster, Gregory Lombardi, Iain Morley, Dior Fall, Sunkarie Balla-Conteh, and Takeh Sendze.  Thank you. 
MR. WEYL:
Your Honour, I am Frederick Weyl, co-counsel for Ngirumpatse, who is next to me.  
MS. DIAGNE:
Good morning, Your Honour, Dior Diagne.  I am assisted by Felix Sow.  We are here for the defence of the interests of Karemera.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Good morning, Mr. President and Judge Kam.  I am Peter Robinson for Joseph Nzirorera, and I am assisted by Leopold Nsengiyumva, my legal assistant.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think that we're going to have a very abbreviated status conference, partly because the space, the courtroom space, has been allocated to another trial and we are going to have to vacate it for that purpose.  But for an additional reason, and during the Rwamakuba status conference, we agreed on a trial schedule which will permit the commencement of the Rwamakuba hearing on the 6th of June, and it will continue until the court recess.  That means that the Karemera trial could begin at the commencement of the December term, and the day that we are thinking of is the -- I think it's the 
5th of September.  Yes, Monday, the 5th the September, and we'd like to run it for a period of eight weeks.  The reason for that is that we think that if we did that, the rest of the term would be used for the completion of the Rwamakuba hearing and then -- so we would have one-eight week session in Karemera between now and Christmastime.  That would seem to be the most appropriate.  Of course, it's not as yet cast in stone, but that's the schedule that seems to be emerging at the moment.  Are there any comments?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, that's fine with Mr. Nzirorera's team. 

MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, for Mr. Ngirumpatse, that would be fine as well.  
MS. DIAGNE:
Your Honour, I simply wanted an explanation.  You are proposing the 5th of September for the beginning of the trial?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  The preliminary matters will be built towards that date, but if we could agree on that as a -- it eases up the speed with which the preliminary matters need to be conducted.  Once we got that established as a reasonable target date, it takes into account a number of issues which were raised, and it gives an opportunity for the Defence team for Ngirumpatse to be properly constituted.  That is one of the major issues that we can settle.  
MS. FALL:
Very well.  The Karemera team would go along with that, Your Honour.  
MR. WEBSTER:
The proposed start date is fine by the Prosecution, but I am curious -- I would like a clarification, however.  The Court mentioned eight weeks, which would take us up to the 28th of October.  Am I to understand that we then spend the next six weeks on the Rwamakuba defence case, or is there some flexibility with that?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We anticipated that that would give sufficient time, subject to unexpected developments.  
MR. WEBSTER:
That would be fine.  It's impossible to say how long the Defence case for Rwamakuba would take.  I was thinking, or hoping, that it would be less time, and that we would be able to hear more of Karemera, but the schedule the Court suggests is fine for us. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There's still an opportunity for an adjustment, I think, and we would have more information about that when the Prosecutor closes its case in the matter.  At that stage, the Rwamakuba team would be able to be more accurate in their forecasts.

Mr. Webster, in this environment, what would be an appropriate date for the filing of pre-trial briefs and ancillary documents?  We had originally thought of the 3rd of June, but if we are going to start in September, would it be appropriate to give a bit more leeway or would you still wish to comply with the 3rd of June deadline?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I would prefer that the Court set a later deadline with the understanding that the Prosecution will make every effort to file before the deadline. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
What's the date you would suggest?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I suggested in my memo the 13th of June. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thirteenth of June. 
MR. WEBSTER:
But with the understanding that the motion schedule that I had anticipated would factor in.  We've -- I suppose we'll go into that later, but if the Defence files their motions in two weeks and there is a Prosecution response and a Court decision fairly shortly thereafter, then we'll have the time we need in order to finalise the pre-trial brief.  If the Defence takes a much longer period of time to file and we file later and the Court renders its decision later, then that puts us in a bit of a bind, so it certainly -- those are really my concerns. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What I am thinking is this.  We are going to be starting the Rwamakuba hearing, so the Chamber will itself be occupied in terms of addressing these issues.  Now, in terms of another response to the pre-trial motions, I'm wondering whether it would -- if we would readjust our schedules so that the pre-trial filings would take place around the end of June.  That will give everybody sufficient time.  It will give the Defence an opportunity to file any documents or motions they wish to file before the beginning of September.  And we could build towards the pre-trial conference on the Friday before the 5th of September.  Would that be a suitable time, or do you think that the pre-trial conference should take place a bit earlier than that?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I do think the pre-trial conference should take place earlier than the Friday before, because anything that can be -- I'm sure that there would be many things -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would the Monday before be an appropriate time?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I think it would. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Monday. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we'll schedule the pre-trial conference for one week before the 5th of September. 
MR. ROBINSON:
It would be optimum to do it even further apart, but depending on the constraints, but I think it would be better to do it even two weeks before. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Two weeks is what you recommend?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I do, but maybe that would require some adjustment of the start date of the trial.  I don't know.  Two weeks would be optimum; one week would be satisfactory. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor.  
MR. WEBSTER:
We're flexible on that point.  The 22nd would be fine.  The 29th is fine as well.  I think it makes more sense to do it on the 22nd.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you think that for the trial, if the effectiveness of the trial commencement time, a two-week time limit is better?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Two weeks would be fine, would be appropriate, and it would be more workable.  I think the budgetary aspect is probably what would weigh in because I'm assuming that the Defence would come and arrive and remain until the trial begins.  If that's the way it's going to work out, then the 22nd makes much more sense because we'll have more time to address any problematic issues.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honour's microphone.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What we're trying to do now, gentlemen, if we dealt with the pre-trial issues, the filing of the pre-trial briefs, the statements of admissions, the statements of contested matters, the -- if these things were dealt with in June, at the end of June, then the actual pre-trial conference's importance in terms of assisting trial preparations would be reduced because there would be enough time to address any issues that could impact upon the readiness for trial.  So what we are thinking of is -- what we are doing now is making these sorts of orders that would normally be made at the pre-trial conference; we are making them today, so we'll be directing the time for the filing of the pre-trial brief and the related documents.  And those should be filed, we think, by the end of June, which would give everybody adequate opportunity to make trial preparations.  

So I would not think -- that's why I thought that an abbreviated time between the former conference and the trial date was more appropriate.  I don't know if --  
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Your Honour.  Frederick Weyl.  I am completely in agreement with what you have just said.  I believe that if there should not be any problem, then the pre-trial conference could be brought nearer to the trial.  If there are going to be problems, and the indications of Mr. Webster make me feel that we may perhaps separate the two by 15 days, that would worry me, because if there are going to be problems, 15 days would not be sufficient at all.  But I would prefer the solution you are suggesting, that the pre-trial conference be held at the beginning of June or end of June, beginning of July, to determine that there is no problem and then we can proceed to the commencement of the trial without any problems and probably have all the time needed to resolve any problems that may have arisen.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
A point of correction.  I wasn't proposing that we actually meet at the end of June, but that all the documents were filed and became available to all the parties.  It would have much the same effect, and it would enable the identification of any matters of controversy and give adequate time to deal with any problems that may arise.  So it wasn't an actual meeting but the delivery of the full documentation to the trial.  So that's acceptable.  

What I would like to do in that case, it means a slight adjustment to the scheduling order we had initially prepared, and I would just like to have our staff redo it in a more precise manner and then we'll deliver the scheduling order later today.

In the meantime, I think I should put on the record that the informal working sessions that were held earlier this week between the parties turned out to be quite fruitful and that, in my view, it does not seem that the majority of the issues that had been raised remain contentious.  

In terms of our preparation for trial and the records for the proceedings -- it may be relevant even for the pre-trial issues, we wanted to direct that motions that are filed are brief and well structured.  

On translation issues, this is a crucial matter for the proper administration of the case.  We're encouraging the parties to cooperate with each other and to use the practical tools provided by the Tribunal to reduce the impact of translation and delay.  

Now, in view of the matters that had been raised in our working sessions, I should recall that the Prosecution is considered bilingual and there is a jurisprudence to that effect from the 
Appeals Chamber.  And I would therefore invite the Prosecutor to use its best efforts to reduce the impact of translations in these proceedings, which could be done, for example, by filing responses in French where there are Francophone teams and in English to the motions filed by the Anglophone teams.  That might be a method of reducing time, reducing delay issues.  

In communications with the Chamber, we would like to recall that any official communication to the attention of the Chamber must be filed through the Court Management Section, not through the trial coordinator.  

And the Chamber requests that the parties would file electronic versions of documents, where existing, along with hard copies of the file.  

I would like to make an order on the time limits to file replies under Rule 73(E).  Except where it is otherwise decided by the Chamber, any responding party to a motion instructed to file any reply no later than five days.  The replying party to the said reply shall file any reply no later than five days.  

The scheduling order, which we intended to have the format of an oral order, will be prepared and circulated later today.  

We have, I think, come to the end of the mandatory issues for our status conference, but are there any other issues which anybody thinks is required to be addressed before we adjourn our session?  
MR. WEBSTER:
This morning we served on CMS for distribution to the parties a memorandum, an explanatory memorandum, with an index of the supporting materials that were provided to the Trial Chamber to deliberate on the motion to amend.  In addition to that index, we also provided one statement, which is the only statement that our records do not reflect prior service on the Defence.  So by our internal memoranda, the Defence have every bit of material that was served on the Court in order to decide the motion to amend which would then trigger the time limit of Rule 72.  So the 30-day period would start from now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
From today?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  I'd invited the Defence to raise any objections that they would have because the index was there.  Unfortunately, we're meeting earlier than we anticipated.  We only served this memo earlier this morning, so I'm sure they haven't received it yet.  But I simply wanted to place that on the record.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I don't mean to belabour these proceedings -- I know we're under time pressure -- but I did want to say that I did receive that memorandum, and I do have some objections in that I also want to receive any filings that were made with the Trial Chamber in connection with the supplemental supporting materials.  So if there is any memorandum or any proceeding that was given ex parte to the Trial Chamber, I think that should unsealed and disclosed to the Defence.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is that -- is there any -- 

MR. WEBSTER:
I can explain.  On one or two occasions, there was an inquiry made from the Trial Chamber for additional supporting materials.  We provided those materials.  There must have been some way of recording those communications.  And I believe what Mr. Robinson is asking for is any covering memoranda that accompanied the witness statement that was provided at a later time.  Our submission on that issue is that the covering memoranda is not supporting material; any argument that would be contained in those covering memoranda is not supporting material; the supporting material is the statements themselves that would be used to assess the, you know, whether there's a prima facia case on the basis of the evidence that we submitted.  

If we put ourselves in the perspective of a confirming judge, when an indictment is initially confirmed, none of the discussion that goes on between the prosecutor and the confirming judge is recorded and served on the defence.  The only thing that is served on the defence is the witness statements themselves or the documents themselves.  

And the Rule 50 amendment is simply introducing that procedure to a motion to amend.  So while there's nothing compromising in those memoranda, as a point of principle, we're not obligated to disclose it, and we elect not to.  If the Court orders otherwise, that is in its discretion.  But we have complied with our obligation and I believe that addresses the issue.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, perhaps I'll file a written motion to that for disclosure of that.  We can deal with that in that way, given the time limitations, unless you want to hear argument on it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Not now.  We don't have time to discuss it now.  

Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I thank you.  I had three observations to make.  The first is on the index I went through.  I'm sorry to say -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could I invite you -- what I would like to suggest with regard to the index and the CD-ROM issues, could those discussions be followed up with the trial coordinator outside of this formal status conference session?  
MR. WEYL:
It was simply a remark concerning the objections that the Prosecutor made.  It is on the communication he made.  He did ask for the severance of Rwamakuba's trial.  The document he gave us is very burdensome and continues to contain witnesses in conjunction with Rwamakuba, in conjunction, that would be clear later on.  If there is severance, there should be severance of documents as well and should contain one column for Rwamakuba and another column concerning the three other Accused and (unintelligible) certain number of names concerning Rwamakuba. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, we had discussed this issue in the Rwamakuba status conference, so I think it would be reasonable and it would be effective if it was followed up with the trial coordinator and the Prosecutor after the status conference is closed.  I think it is possible that there would be a satisfactory answer to the inquiry you have raised.  

Are there any other issues?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I just wanted to respond partially to Mr. Weyl.  I think there's -- well, I may be misunderstanding him, but what we served, with the memorandum that I mentioned this morning, was the index itself that accompanied the supporting materials.  I believe that's our obligation if we want to demonstrate what materials were handed up to the Court.  So the index that includes Rwamakuba is there because that's what the Court received to decide both the severance issue and the amendment issue.  So it really is contrary to his interests to have partial disclosure on that point.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yeah. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't think there is a controversial or contentious issue here.  It's a matter which you can discuss with Mr. Weyl and with our trial coordinator outside of this session. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  No problem.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I have a problem in that this courtroom is required for another trial now.  So I would like to close our session, unless there is something that is extremely important that needs to be addressed before we do so.  That being the case, I would like to close our session.  

Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL:
I am confused, Your Honour.  I thought there was a burning issue before all the other problems.  I had some exchanges yesterday with the Defence section that appeared to be fraught with some difficulties concerning the function of our team, which are three in number.  I believe that there was a misunderstanding that the Defence section -- I was told that in default of his replacement, Mr. Roach would remain lead counsel.  I think there was a misinterpretation of the decision, but I believe that it is up to me to assume the defence of Ngirumpatse whilst we seek a replacement.  That may have been a misunderstanding.  

A second misunderstanding is relative to the fact that today there is a legal assistant appointed for the team, who is Mr. Bangoura, and for reasons that the Chamber would understand and that are inherent to the difficulties of Mr. Ngirumpatse and his lead counsel, it would be opportune that Mr. Bangoura continues to serve as legal assistant.  The Chamber might wish to help me, with the good offices of the Defence section, so that if this misunderstanding were to persist, the Court would understand my need to have a temporary legal assistant apart -- who is not Mr. Bangoura. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Weyl.  These are matters which, I think, have also been taken up between the Chamber and the DCDMS.  But I suppose it would be appropriate to put on record an expression of concern that the Chamber has that the DCDMS use its best officers to ensure that the Defence teams are fully constituted quickly, that they are bilingual, as a whole.  I think it is important that the Defence teams all have bilingual capacity, particularly in regard to the issue of translation matters, and that they are allowed to work without hindrance in all proper investigations with a view to the attainment of the start of dates that we have decided on today.  

DCDMS, please, is there anything you wish to say at this stage, the DCDMS?  
MS. N'GUM:
Thank you, Your Lordship.  The misunderstanding, as stated by Mr. Weyl, came because of 
Article 20(A), the directive on the assignment of Defence counsel, Your Lordship, which reads -- I don't know whether you want me to read it or -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.
MS. N'GUM:
So it was my understanding that, according to Article 20(A), lead counsel remains so until his replacement.  So this is the misunderstanding that he's talking about. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Has the misunderstanding been resolved?  
MS. N'GUM:
Well, he didn't come back to me, so if he comes back to me we can discuss it again.  

And the second problem relating to the legal assistant is that the legal assistant's contract is valid until June 2005, and, Your Lordship, unless we receive a good reason why the legal assistant's contract should be terminated, we would not like to go into litigation relating to termination of contract for someone for no good reason.  So if he puts it in writing, the DCDMS will take it into consideration, but we are prepared to help him as soon as possible.  Because he was also talking about the investigator and said, according to him, because they were working with Mr. Roach, he doesn't think that he can work with them, and I didn't think that that was a good reason for somebody to be -- to have their contract terminated, Your Lordship.  

However, if he puts in writing what he wants to say regarding the work that those -- the legal assistant and the investigator are doing or not doing, then we'll take that into consideration, Your Lordship.  

And we would also like to emphasise that matters relating to the administration of the DCDMS, we would appreciate it very much if counsel would use the appellate procedures that are provided.  If DCDMS does not accept an application that is made by lead counsel or co-counsel for -- in this case, for the changing of his legal assistant or investigator, which I would like to put on record has not happened yet, that was just an conversation -- the appellate procedure is for him to appeal to the Deputy Registrar; from there to the Registrar and then to the President of the Tribunal, before burdening the Trial Chamber with administrative issues, Your Lordship.  We would request all counsel to follow that procedure, Your Lordship. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I would like to make a comment on your last remark.  You see, the appellate procedure cannot be followed if there's no decision.  And as far as I have understood, one of the complaints is that it takes too long to get a decision, and that is why the matter has come before me.  We are interested in having these matters resolved because it may affect the conduct of the trial.  But I think I appreciate the other comments that you have made, and we hope that the matters will be resolved as effectively as possible.
MS. N'GUM:
Thank you, Your Lordship.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I have to close our session now.  
(Court adjourned at 1220H)
