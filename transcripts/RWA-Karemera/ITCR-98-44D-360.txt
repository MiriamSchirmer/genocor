P R O C E E D I N G S 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everyone.  

The proceedings are resumed.  

Before we make our ruling, could we have the appearances of the parties for the record starting with the Prosecution, please.  
MS. MAPOSA:  
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  The Prosecution bar is composed of the following:  Mr. Paul Ng'arua, senior trial attorney, will be joining us shortly; Simba Mawere, 
assistant trial attorney; Diana Karanja, associate legal officer; Ephrem Mutashya, language assistant; Déogratias Mugalama, intern; and myself, Memory Maposa, appear as counsel.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.  

Defence, please.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Good morning, Your Honours.  

Now the Defence is made up of Philippe Larochelle, Nathalie Leblanc, the Accused, two investigators, Fernand Batard and Célestin Kagango.  And my name is Mr. Vincent Courcelle-Labrousse.  I am very sorry for not having been able to join you until now.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
We would like to welcome you back, Learned Counsel.  

Before the witness is brought in, this is the ruling of the Trial Chamber with regard to permission to vary the list of witnesses to allow T150 to testify on certain paragraphs of the indictment.  

On 7th October 2010 the Defence filed a motion requesting permission to vary a list of witnesses and for reconsideration of earlier decisions pertaining to the scope of Defence witness testimony pursuant to Rule 73 ter (E).  In particular, the Defence requested that the Trial Chamber reconsider its decision of 4th June 2010 limiting the scope of the testimony of Defence Witness T150, and on 14th July denying reconsideration or leave to appeal the 4th June 2010 decision.  

In support for its request for reconsideration the Defence notes that Defence Witnesses T36 and T37 have opted not to testify in this trial and explains that T150 is in a position to testify on issues that these witnesses would have addressed.  

Following a decision granting an extension of time to respond, the Prosecution filed a response on 15th October 2010 objecting to the Defence motion.  Pointing to Defence proofing charts, the Prosecution submits that the Defence already has sufficient witnesses scheduled to testify to all the allegations in the indictment.  

In this oral decision, the Trial Chamber will only consider the issues related to the scope of the testimony of Defence Witness T150.  A written decision will follow in due course addressing these and other issues.  

The Trial Chamber accepts that the decision of Witness -- the decisions of Witnesses T36 and T37 not to testify in this trial constitutes a new circumstance warranting reconsideration of the Trial Chamber's earlier decisions on the scope of the testimony of Defence Witness T150.  

The Trial Chamber notes that in any informal communication sent after the close of yesterday's session, the Defence clarified that it would like to have Witness T150 testify on indictment paragraphs 16, 19, and 21, in addition to paragraph 53.  

The Trial Chamber notes that according to the Defence proofing charts available, Defence Witnesses T36 and T37 were scheduled to testify with respect to indictment paragraphs 16 and 19, but not indictment paragraph 21.  Therefore, the Trial Chamber will allow the defence, Witness T150, to testify with respect to indictment paragraph 16 and 19 in addition to paragraph 53.  

The Defence has not demonstrated that a new circumstance has arisen warranting reconsideration of the Trial Chamber's earlier decisions with respect to paragraph 21.  

That is the ruling of the Trial Chamber.  

Defence, is the witness here and are you ready to proceed with his testimony? 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Yes, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Registry, could you arrange for the witness to be brought into the courtroom after the curtains have been drawn.  

Registry, what would be the number of this witness? 
MR. MATEMANGA: 
Twenty-nine. 
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, Witness.  We welcome you to these proceedings.  

Can you hear the Trial Chamber? 
THE WITNESS: 
I can hear you very well.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Witness.  Now, kindly switch off your microphone and remember to leave it switched off when you're not speaking as we proceed with your testimony.  

Registrar, could you administer the solemn declaration to the witness, please.  
(Declaration made by Witness T150 in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, once again we would like to give you a briefing on how your testimony will unfold today and on subsequent days until we come to the end.  We would like to remind you to switch on and off your microphone depending on whether you are speaking or not.  Do not leave your microphone open as it will interfere with the recording and the interpretation of your evidence, as well as its understanding.  And we would also like to know what language you will be using during your testimony, is it Kinyarwanda or French, or English? 
THE WITNESS: 
I would express myself in Kinyarwanda.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
There is a small technical problem which you can assist us overcome if you are testifying in Kinyarwanda by waiting for the question to be interpreted to you and pausing for a few minutes before you start speaking; if you can count from one to three before you start answering, that will enable those who are listening to you in Kinyarwanda, including the accused person, to get your answer in full.  It will also enable the interpreters and the recorders and ourselves to understand your answer for fully.  So, kindly remember to pause after hearing the question, before you begin answering.  

Now, on the procedures that obtain here, you are a Defence witness and, therefore, they will lead your evidence-in-chief.  And the Defence team is seated on your left hand.  They will ask you questions to lead your evidence-in-chief.  

When they are done, the Prosecution, which is seated on your right below the translation booths, will also be entitled to ask you questions and you have to answer all questions put to you briefly and directly.  Do not beat about the bush as this wastes Court's time.  Answer all questions put to you, and if you have not understood a question ask for it to be clarified or repeated.  

Your answers should be given a courteous manner and, likewise, the counsels who are putting questions to are you obliged to be courteous to you.  

We will be conducting your testimony in both open and closed sessions.  Because you are a protected witness it may happen that the questions that are to be put to you may identify you.  In that case, we will order for the recording of your evidence in a closed session to prevent your identity being disclosed.  This is a decision that lies entirely with the Trial Chamber.  

If there is no threat to your identity, we will ask that your testimony be taken in open session.  And while we are in open session the public will be allowed to attend and they may get hold of the record that may be made of it.  So, you have to be careful while we're in open session not to disclose your identity or give any information that might lead to its disclosure.  You will be warned every time we will be moving in and out of an open session, so that you can act accordingly.  

I forgot to say that the Judges may ask you questions at any time during the proceedings, so you should be prepared for that eventuality.  

Witness, we would now like to know if you have understood our instructions to you before you begin your testimony.  
THE WITNESS: 
That is fine.  I have understood you very well.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Witness.  

We would now like to hand you over to the Defence, and to observe that we are in open session.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Thank you, Madam President. 
WITNESS T150, 
first having been duly sworn, 
testified as follows: 
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Q.	Witness, we will give you -- or, rather, you certainly have there on the table before you a document which is your personal identification sheet.  Can you read that document, or -- are there -- where you have your particulars? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So, you have on that sheet your name and first name on that document, you also have your date of birth.  By the way, Witness, do you read French? 
A.	(Microphone not activated) 
Q.	We did not hear you; your microphone was not turned on.  
A.	I see a few notes here in Kinyarwanda on the sheet.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Maybe we may have to ask for one of the interpreters from the Kinyarwanda booth to help the witness to read through the document so that we can move a bit faster.  Is that possible? 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Could we have one of the personnel in the Kinyarwanda booth come down to assist the witness, please. 
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Q.	Good.  Witness, the document that was just read to you, can you confirm whether the information contained therein is accurate? 
A.	Yes, the information here is accurate.  
Q.	Well and good.  Do you have a pen? 
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	Please, sign the document and append the date on the document.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The witness says he has a pen.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Q.	You signed.  Good.  After signing at the date as well -- and today is the 19th of October 2010.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
In that case, I would sub -- ask that this document be admitted as proof.  It should be 205 (sic) and placed under seal. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Prosecution?  
MS. MAPOSA:  
No objection, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
The personal identification sheet of this witness is admitted as an exhibit for the Defence, under seal, and it is Defence Exhibit No. --
MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 105. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
-- D. 105, under seal, because it contains the personal particulars of this witness, who is a protected witness.  
(Exhibit No. D. 105 admitted, under seal) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Thank you, Madam President.  

My examination-in-chief would be in two phases:  The first would be in closed session, since we'd be raising and discussing the identity of the witness.  And secondly, I would have wider questions, more open questions, which would not warrant us moving into closed session.  And then the third phase we will be going into closed session, again, since I will touch on issues that may reveal the identity of the witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Registry, could you arrange for a closed session.  

Members of the public you have to leave now.  We are moving into a closed session for reasons given by learned counsel for the Defence to protect the witness.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 7 to 10] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 1 to 6 by Eleanor Bastian)
















 MS. BEN SALIMO: 
      We are now in open session, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, we are now in open session.  Don't give any information that may lead to your identity.  If you have any problem with any question, let the Trial Chamber know.  

Learned Counsel, you may proceed.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Q.	Witness, I shall ask you some questions now.  

Witness, would you be able to tell us -- and I'm referring to 1994, the answers which you provide should fall within 1994.  As far as you recollect, how much time did it require to go from the commune office in Nyabikenke to the préfecture office in Gitarama? 
A.	I would say that during the dry season it would take about one hour to cover that distance.  
Q.	You are talking about the dry season.  And during the rainy season, do you have another estimate for that period? 
A.	During the rainy season it would require between one hour and 30 minutes and two hours, because sometimes the road is slippery.  
Q.	Witness, when you give this estimate, what type of vehicle were you driving?  

I could rephrase the question.  

These estimates of the time that it took to cover the distance could be respected (sic) with what type of vehicle? 
A.	When I came up with that estimate I was referring to someone who would be driving a pickup truck.  
Q.	Was that the type of vehicle which you had at the commune in 1994? 
A.	*************************************************. 
Q.	Was it an off-road vehicle? 
A.	Yes, it was a 4x4.  
Q.	Still talking about distances covered, still in 1994.  And according to your estimates, how much time would it take to go from the Nyabikenke commune office right up to Kigali, Kigali centre? 
A.	During the dry season that distance could be covered in two hours.  
Q.	And in the rainy season? 
A.	In the rainy season the distance could be covered in three hours, but sometimes when the road was slippery it could take right up to four hours.  
Q.	One small clarification, Witness.  Still talking about 1994, could you tell us at what time you had the dry season in Rwanda? 
A.	Normally, the rainy season runs from April to May.  
Q.	Is it still the same today? 
A.	Yes, it is still the same situation today. 
Q.	Let's go back to 1994.  The times that you gave us to cover those distances, do they refer to one itinerary to go from the Nyabikenke commune office to Kigali?  Were there several possible routes? 
A.	There were three routes. 
Q.	And which of those three routes was the shortest?  Was it the one you were referring to? 
A.	The shortest route was the one from the commune office through Bwayu (sic), Kayumbu, Gaperi, Kigali.  That was the road I was referring to a while ago when I came up with those estimates. 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Rutobwe is R-U-T-O-B-W-E.  Gaperi is number 2 on the spelling list.  Kayumbu is number 6.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Q.	You answered, but not quite the question I put to you.  I wanted to know whether the route you referred to when talking about 1994 was the shortest. 
A.	Yes, it was the shortest route, and that road was used by vehicles in 1994. 
Q.	Still talking about this route, but today in 2010, was the condition of the road from the commune office in Nyabikenke and Gaperi -- has the condition of that road changed? 
A.	In 1994, that road was not as good as it is today.  
Q.	My question has to do with today.  Today in 2010, are there other roads that could connect the Nyabikenke commune office and Kigali faster than in 1994? 
A.	Yes, there is another route which can be used.  One can pass by Kamonyi, Gacurabwenge, Kayenzi, Bakokwe and, finally, you get to the commune office.  But in 1994, this road was impassable; the road could not be used by vehicles.  But today, that road has been rehabilitated and vehicles can easily ply the road. 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Kamonyi is spelt K-A-M-O-N-Y-I; Gacurabwenge is spelt G-A-C-U-R-A-B-W-E-N-G-E; Bakokwe B-A-K-O-K-W-E; Kayenzi K-A-Y-E-N-Z-I. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel. 
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Q.	Witness, let us talk about some other distance in 1994.  To get from Kigali centre to Gasenyi, Gasenyi in Nyabikenke, how much time would it take?  I am referring to the secteur -- or, rather, the Gikina secteur, the Gasenyi trading centre.  So let me rephrase my question.

In 1994 you are at the Kigali centre and you are driving in a car heading to the Gikina secteur at the Gikina (sic) trading centre; how much time would it take you? 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Learned Counsel, before the witness answers.  

Is it Gikina trading centre?  Or Gikina secteur?  Or the Gasenyi trading centre?  The question is confused about those names.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Yes, indeed.  I'm talking about the Gasenyi trading centre, G-A-S-E-N-Y-I, which is located in the Kigina secteur, K-I-G-I-N-A. 
MS. MAPOSA:  
Madam President, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, the witness is present. 
MS. MAPOSA:  
I would request the witness be taken out briefly. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, we have an issue to discuss with counsel, the standard procedure here is that we discuss these issues in the absence of the witness.  We may request you on several occasions to leave the courtroom to enable us to carry out this exercise and we pray for your understanding.  Would you leave now, after the curtains have been drawn?
(Witness exited courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Counsel.  
MS. MAPOSA:  
Madam President, Your Honours, we have an objection to make in respect to the line of the questioning that Defence counsel is now adopting.  Initially, we thought that the Defence counsel just wanted to have the witness enlighten the Trial Chamber on some general distances but it appears, as we go on, we are actually getting into more depth of specific distances between locations which are subject of the indictment, an issue that the Prosecutor gave no notice of, that this witness is going to really get into details.  

I'm sure Your Honours know that Gasenyi is covered in the indictment, and this is the previous question that the Defence counsel has just asked the witness.  And we actually are objecting to that line of questioning now because we do not have notice that this witness is coming to this Court to really go into depth concerning distances between locations that are covered in the indictment.  

Yes, we do acknowledge that this witness is a driver, and ******************************************, but we've no notice that he's actually coming to tell the Court in much depth about specific distances, Your Honours.  And we are thus requesting the Trial Chamber to disallow this line of questioning as it is now getting into much depth which we are not prepared for, to cross-examine the witness on.  

These are our objections, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.  

Defence Counsel.  
(Pages 11 to 14 by Eleanor Bastian)





























1045H 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Madam President, you must have observed that in the statement dated 12th February 2010, signed by the witness, the issue of the distances is clearly addressed in paragraphs 29, 30, 31, 32 of the statement.  With specific questions, estimates are provided.  I am, therefore, falling in line with the line of questions that was put on notice to the Prosecutor through this very detailed statement that was disclosed to them.  

The obligation to disclose does not require me to give the Prosecution a list of all the questions that are going to be put to the witness in court.  The notice provided by this statement are the issues that the witness could address.  

Secondly, as Madam Prosecutor is rightly saying, the witness **********************************.  And, furthermore********************, who better than him is to tell us how much time it would take to cover distances in 1994 and even today because ********************************************  

Thirdly, the locations I have mentioned are locations concerned by the indictment and even the paragraphs which you specifically -- or, rather, paragraphs which specifically concern 
Callixte Nzabonimana, particularly paragraph 16, because the events of paragraph 16 took place in the Kigina secteur.  I, therefore, believe that it is not useless the role of the witness here.  

It is necessary for him to give an account of the time it would take to cover those distances in 1994, to go from Kigali centre to Kigina secteur, this very large commune in Nyabikenke, which I shouldn't remind you covers more than 40 kilometres from the north to the south.  I am, therefore, requesting that that objection be overruled.  
MS. MAPOSA:
Madam President, Your Honours, like I said, we did not object when general issues about distances were being led because they are covered here.  If that issue of Kigina and Gasenyi was considered important by the Defence, they were going to include it in the statement as they have done with other distances here, Your Honours.  This is our objection.  So we insist that if this line of questioning can be disallowed, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Learned Counsel, our difficulty is that we have not been able to find a statement.  So we are not able to decide exactly what the content of the statement is.  We have the statements which were forwarded to us, but we don't see the statement of this witness.  
Does any of the parties have a copy? 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Yes, Madam President.  I have several copies.  They have numbers from the registry, which means they were filed.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  Which paragraph? 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Paragraphs 29, 30, 31 and 32, the last two pages.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

This is the ruling of the Trial Chamber:  The Trial Chamber has had the benefit of looking at paragraphs 16 and 19 of the indictment as well as the statements -- the statement that was disclosed by the Defence to the Prosecution.  It has also taken into account its own ruling made earlier this morning, and it is of the view that while some of the questions are covered by the statement disclosed, the specific question goes beyond the purview of that statement.  We will allow this answer to be made, but we will not allow the Defence Counsel to develop this area further.  And we would like to remind the Defence to live within the statement and the paragraphs that we have clearly pointed to in our decision.  

Can we have back the witness in court, Registry.  

After this question we will take the break and continue when we resume later.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, can you hear the Trial Chamber? 
THE WITNESS:
Very well.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You will continue with your testimony.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Witness, I will repeat the question I put to you a few minutes ago.  Please be attentive, Witness.  

Can you tell us -- and we are still in 1994.  Can you tell the Trial Chamber what season -- how much time it would take to go by car from the Kigali centre to the Gasenyi trading centre within the Kigina secteur in Nyabikenke? 
A.	That was a distance that could be covered in four or five hours because that was the rainy season.  
Q.	We are on the same question.  And if you allow me just further clarifications because -- Witness, when you say "four to five hours because we were in the rainy season", can you be more precise.  Is it 
	four hours in the dry season and then five hours in the rainy season?  What do you mean exactly?  Can you be more precise, please.
A.	During the dry season that distance could be covered in four hours, while in the rainy season, it would take you five hours.  
Q.	Fine.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you.  We will take the morning break now.  

Witness, you are still testifying, so do not discuss your evidence with anyone.  You will be informed as to when the trial will resume.  

The proceedings are adjourned to 11:45.  
(Court recessed from 1109H to 1145H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, once again.  The proceedings are resumed.  

Learned Counsel, we are still in open session.  Are we going to stay here? 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Madam President, I would be addressing very specific questions which will definitely identify the witness.  So I request that we go into a closed session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, can we go into a closed session.  And the public should leave at this moment and the reasons are those outlined by learned counsel.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [page 18 to 52] was extracted and filed under separate cover as the session was heard in camera) 
(Pages 15 to 17 by Sithembiso Moyo)











MR. MATEMANGA: 
We are in open session now. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Registry.

Witness T150, we have now come to the end of your testimony.  We thank you for coming to enlighten the Chamber about the events of 1994 in your area.  We will have an opportunity at a later stage to consider your evidence alongside all of the evidence that has been given and that will be given in this trial.  We will then come up with a verdict.  We thank you, once again, and you may now leave.

Wait until the curtains have been drawn before you can move.

You may move, Witness.  We wish you a safe journey home.
THE WITNESS:
Madam President, would you kindly authorise me to say hello to Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness.  If he doesn't object, the registry will arrange an appropriate time for you to say hello.  But you may leave now.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you very much.  
(Witness excused) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Defence Counsel, your next witness.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Madam President, as you asked me with a sense of humour, unfortunately -- and please.  This is not to our advantage in any way because any day of hearing that is lost may never be recovered.  

You are very aware, Madam, that we ran into some difficulties at the last minute to get some witnesses for this session.  And so, unfortunately -- well, this is what I just witnessed myself, and I don't think it's going to be very interesting.

But unfortunately, we do not have any witness to bring here to call this afternoon or even tomorrow. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  This then marks the end of this session, and the Trial Chamber would like to make these remarks, and we will give an opportunity to the parties to say anything they want to say before we adjourn finally this case.

We have observed that there have been hitches in this session, some beyond the control of the parties but some within their control.  So we would like to urge them that, when we next meet, those hitches which are made by the parties should be avoided completely.

With that said, we would like to thank each one of you, the parties and your teams, for your contribution towards the successful conclusion of this session.  We would like to make special mention of lead counsel and co-counsel for both teams, their supporting staff.  

We would like to mention registry staff -- particularly courtroom officers, interpreters, recorders, witness protection personnel, security personnel, technicians, and all those others behind the scenes who have played a role in this session.   

We can't forget our own, that is, Chamber staff.  We would like to thank them for their contribution individually and collectively in supporting the Trial Chamber, and we hope that the team spirit will continue.

As already mentioned, we hope to see a smoother session next time.  And those are the observations we would like to make at this moment.  And before we send everybody off, we would like to know whether the parties have any matters to raise with the Trial Chamber before we say the final word.

Prosecution?  
MS. MAPOSA: 
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  The Prosecution has one request regarding the next session, Your Honours, that if the Defence can be urged to give us the vetting order of the next session in good time so that we can have time to prepare for the next session, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We do recall that last time you agreed on the time and informed us, before we adjourned, that this order of appearance would be ready at a specific date.  Has that been explored by the parties?  
MS. MAPOSA: 
Not yet, Madam President.  But if you can just encourage us to agree as we did last time, I'm sure we can do the same as well like we did last time. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Madam President, we will certainly find an alternative, but we will make sure that the entire time that is gathered here in Arusha since the session was supposed to close on Thursday evening -- we will take advantage of this to hold a meeting ahead of the next session.  We will do all we can to contact the witnesses whom we would like to get over here.

And you certainly are aware that we run into many problems with many witnesses.  And so the question that we would be facing would be whether these witnesses are witnesses who will never come out here because each time there is some reason for their not travelling.

And so we will come up with a list of witnesses very quickly, as quickly as possible, and which we will communicate to the Prosecutor.  I don't think there is any worry to nurse concerning the date when we would forward these to the Prosecution, when we would be able to bring these in the next four months.  
MS. MAPOSA: 
Yes.  And, Madam President, Your Honours, in view of these difficulties that are envisaged by the Defence, the Prosecution thinks that it would be quite helpful if the Chamber can give us some time frames when we can have the vetting order because it appears they are facing some difficulties which may even, you know, put us at a disadvantage at the end of the day.  If we can have some time frames from Your Honours, it would be very helpful for us. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, you are the one who is going to do the investigations.  When would be the ideal time, before the start of the trial, for you to receive this information and also to enable witness protection to make the necessary preparations?  
MS. MAPOSA: 
Thank you, Madam President.  Let me just consult with my colleagues.  Just a minute.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Whatever the case, Madam President, Your Honours, the Prosecution knows the witnesses that are already envisaged to appear.  It is obvious that the witnesses who did not come out here this time -- we will do all we can to get them to come here because they are witnesses who are very important for us.  

The others we announced a long time ago -- there could be some variation.  But of course, some witnesses who have not been able or who were not willing to come during the session -- they may say no definitely.  And so the purpose of the meeting that we are going to hold and the time that we need ahead of us would be to be able to go back and contact these persons and see whether, one way or the other, we can get them to come over.
In other words, what I am saying is the Prosecution has the entire list of names.  It has all the witnesses except those that we may find -- we come across now such that any elements for adjustments for the next session are certainly going to be very, very lame or flimsy. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  The last point on this issue, Counsel.  
MS. MAPOSA: 
Yes.  Madam President, Your Honours, it is true that we have a list of names.  But I'm sure, as this session has shown, we may have a list, but we may actually expend our resources and time on people who may not even be appearing to testify, and this really makes it necessary for us to be informed timeously because it appears the uncertainty that the Defence is currently in makes it difficult even for the Prosecution, Your Honours, to plan.   

We are suggesting, Madam President, that if the Defence can be given time to confirm with their witnesses, those who would be appearing -- maybe a month will do.  If they can give us the list, the vetting order, say at the end of November, Your Honours, that would also give us enough time to make our investigations and to prepare. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Defence, end of November?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Fifteenth December.  
MS. MAPOSA: 
Madam President, we all know that 15th December we will actually be getting into the festive season, and it would be very difficult for us.  If we can have it at least before and we make sure that we do some work before the festive season, after the festive season, we also come back to it.  It will be really helpful, Your Honours.  We leave it to Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence.  Last point.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
I find that the Prosecution starts festivities a bit too early.  Fifteenth December?  Madam President, that is about 20 (sic) days before Christmas holidays.  I know we have a lot of shopping to do at that time.  But to me I think that would be leaving us at least some time to do some work. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Counsel, we take the opportunity to remind you that it is recess here from mid-December for all the Chambers.  So learned counsel for the Prosecution might have that in mind perhaps.  So could we agree on the first week of December?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Tenth December.  
MS. MAPOSA: 
That's okay, Madam President, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  That is the latest date the information should be in for all the parties.

Anything else?  All the parties?  
MS. MAPOSA: 
Nothing, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right, then.  We've already made some of the remarks that we intended to make.  And as we are not likely to see many of you before the end of the year and the end-of-the-year festivities which it appears the parties are looking forward to already, we would like to wish you a happy and joyous festive season in December and a happy new year 2011.

This matter is now adjourned to the 28th of February 2011.  
(Court adjourned at 1625H)
