P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If I could begin by taking care of a few housekeeping matters, it should only take a few minutes.  

This is in regard to the exhibits for BTH, which I've already discussed with the Defence teams, and I think that we're in agreement, for the most part.

The first thing I'd like to do is give to the registry a copy of the printout of the first item. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are we in open session?  Yes, we are in open session.  Fine, we are in open session.  
MR. WEBSTER:
The first thing I'd like to do is give to the registry some documents that should be either admitted in evidence or marked for identification.  

The first item is the first document in the bundle that was circulated.  It's the transcript of the interview of BTH of the 8th of February 2008.  There was some discussion of this.  Mr. Robinson had admitted the three separate transcripts from three separate tapes as Defence exhibits.  As the witness clarified in his testimony, Mr. Déo Mbuto was present.  He provided the interpretation during that interview.  And then when we received the transcripts they seemed fairly inadequate to me, so I asked Mr. Mbuto to go over it and to listen more carefully and try to get more of what was actually said onto the page, which he did.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, please slow down a little bit.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  I was trying to push things ahead quickly because we have a lot to get through, but I see that --
MR. PRESIDENT:
But it's causing other problems in the recording process.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  So I just want to clarify what this document is.  It's an enhanced transcription.  In red there are indications of what was actually said on the tape that did not make it onto the transcription that we received from the language section.  And after that I asked Mr. Mbuto to go over it again and to enhance the interpretation that he, himself, handled on the 8th of February by translating more fully what the witness was saying, and those indications are in blue.  

The Defence objects to the admission of this as an exhibit.  So I am offering it as a document marked for identification.  That way the Chamber can compare it to what -- can find what I read to the witness because that's the document I was referring to, and then at a later stage, I may file a separate motion to admit it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Mr. Webster, we will mark it for identification.  But we thought we should indicate to you that we're not going to read it while that is its status.  If it's not in evidence, we're not going to read it.  So we'll mark it for identification, and you'll have an opportunity to move it into evidence --
MR. WEBSTER:
At a later time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If a proper basis for admission is made.  So we will mark it for identification at this stage, but I just wanted to clarify that point.  
MR. WEBSTER:
This would be IP. 7.  
(IP. 7 [marked for identification])
MR. WEBSTER:
The second document is the list of 26 names.  This was the expanded list, which was only -- which I shared with the parties in the Chamber.  It includes the pseudonyms and some other information about the 26 people that were discussed.  The previous exhibit that contained these 26 names was marked P. 299.  What I am suggesting is that we indicate that formal list as 299A and that this one would be designated 299B, and that they both be under seal.  
(Exhibit No. P. 299B admitted under seal)
MR. WEBSTER:
The third document is the text of the organic law of 30 August 1996.  During my examination of BTH, I read Article 6(B) into the record.  And we have agreed that the entire text of that legislation should be introduced, and that would be P. 304, the law of 1996.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
	Exhibit No. P. 304 admitted)
MR. WEBSTER:
The third item -- actually, the fourth, excuse me, is the legislation that was introduced on the 15th of March 2001.  It's the Gacaca law of the 26th of January 2001.  We have all agreed that the entire text would go in.  So that would be P. 305.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
MR. WEBSTER:
All of the remaining documents that I'd like to have identified -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We're not actually doing anything more than raising a question.  Why do we need to admit laws into evidence? 
MR. WEBSTER:
We've done that in the past.  I'm just following what we have done in the past, Your Honour.  There are at least two or three other exhibits of similar legislation.  Two pieces were introduced by the Ngirumpatse team.  Something else was introduced by Karemera.  I referred to it during my examination of the witness.  So simply for ease of access in the record it's being admitted.  It's not entirely necessary, but that's what we've done since the beginning of the trial, so I am simply following our own tradition.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I didn't like the word "tradition."  
MR. WEBSTER:
Precedent.  I'm following our own -- but, quite frankly, sometimes it's difficult to find these different pieces of legislation.  It took me quite awhile to locate this when I was looking for it.  So to have it all in one place in our exhibit list is not a bad thing.  It's all translated in all three languages.  It shouldn't be a problem.  

The other documents, I don't think it's necessary for me to read them because there are at least twelve documents.  I have discussed this with the Defence teams.  They won't be admitted in evidence.  They will be marked for identification.  

IP-008 would be the statement of the 20th of October 2006 from Janvier Bayingana.  That need not be under seal.  But all of the other IP documents, which would be IP. 9 through IP. 23, should be under seal.  
(IP. 8 marked for identification)
MR. WEBSTER:
IP. 9 to IP. 23 are the witness statements that I read portions of from the various witnesses that we referred to during BTH's examination.  Everything is clearly identified on this document, this listing here, which I discussed with each of the three Defence teams.  So I will just hand this to Mr. Issa and then he can find the information in the bundle that was circulated earlier.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification.
	(IP. 9 to 23 marked for identification)
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, excuse me.  I am objecting to that.  That was not the subject of any agreement with Mr. Webster.  
This is linked to whether the Prosecution will really intend or produce these witnesses.  And I think it's very improper for the Prosecution to use the witness statements of third parties who they don't intend to call as witnesses.  So I think that this is linked to the next problem that we need to face as to whether the Prosecution's motion to vary its witness list will be granted.  And I'd ask you to defer your decision, and perhaps we can admit those statements which -- for those witnesses who you grant to add to the witness list because it would be useful then that they can refer to them when they testify.  But if the people are not coming as witnesses, these documents should never have been before the Trial Chamber.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, simply for the clarity of the record, the documents have to be identified.  That's the only way we'll be able to find them if there's an objection to the reference to them on the trial record.  Otherwise, how would the Trial Chamber or an Appeal Chamber be able to locate this information?  Simply marking it for identification does not make it an exhibit in the trial.  It's simply identifying the document on the trial record so that we have a means of finding it if we need to.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, Mr. Webster.  It's not necessary to address this further on this issue.  

Just to clarify the position, Mr. Robinson, while they are marked for identification, they are not part of the evidence and we're not going to read them.  But we accept Mr. Webster's point, that marking them for identification makes it easier to deal with them if he succeeds in his application, because if he did, then we wouldn't know which documents were being referred to.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Then, in terms of the Prosecution motion to vary its witness list, I think that should be the next order of business, since the discussion that Mr. Robinson wants to have about starting the Defence case is contingent on that issue.  So that's what I'd like to address now.  

The decisive issue for us, Your Honours, is not whether the Prosecution case is open now as I speak to you or closed now as I speak to you.  All of the parties in the Chamber have differing views on whether the case is open or closed.  My recollection is that when we gathered on the 5th of December 2007 in a status conference, the Chamber had stated that the case would be -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, could we remind Counsel to please take his -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Sorry -- that the case would be considered closed once the Chamber had finalised its decision on the pending motion to admit certain exhibits.  That decision was rendered on the 25th of January 2008.  So it had always been our understanding that that was the date of the closure of the Prosecution case.  But that's not a decisive element for this application.  

This Chamber has already adjudicated a motion under Rule 98 bis.  That motion comes at the conclusion of Prosecution evidence.  It reviewed the Prosecution evidence in deciding that motion.  It did not make any exclusive reference to any of the three witnesses who have been testifying over the past week.  There is nothing inconsistent with moving ahead and considering the Prosecution case closed prior to hearing the conclusion of the cross-examinations of those three witnesses.  So we do not view setting a specific date as the closure of the Prosecution case as a decisive factor in how this Chamber will address our current application to vary the witness list.  

We are presented with a very unique circumstance.  When I read the texts of Rule 73 bis or Rule 73 ter or Rule 98 bis, it's not clear to me how the rules view our present circumstance when a situation of flux, but it's one that the Trial Chamber has been able to deal with and seems perfectly capable of dealing with and has dealt with effectively up to this point.  

What we are confronted with now is a situation that was unforeseen back in December of 2007 when we addressed the beginning of the Defence case.  Witness BTH provided certain information to the Bicamumpaka defence team on the 8th of February 2008.  The Prosecution was represented in that meeting between Witness BTH and a Defence team in another case.  As a result of that meeting, the defence of Joseph Nzirorera filed a motion to recall BTH for additional cross-examination.  That motion was granted by this Chamber on the 12th of March, I believe, which is what led us to hear testimony from BTH over the past week or so.  

It would appear that BTH has changed his position radically, drastically.  He's affected the balance of evidence in the Prosecution case.  Whether we consider that case closed or open, his testimony over the past week would provide ample justification for an application to reopen the Prosecution case and to present additional evidence.  There is no way that the Prosecution could have foreseen that one of its key witnesses would do a complete about-face and now start providing information or evidence that's favourable to the accused and renounce his former testimony upon which the Prosecution relied to convict Joseph Nzirorera.  

It's completely unforeseen.  It's a new circumstance.  It's taken us all by surprise.  And I think the Chamber commented earlier this morning that itself was surprised and taken aback by this recent development.  

So in light of that recent development, the Prosecution makes its application to add witnesses in order to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.  This Chamber is empowered with discretion to grant such an application.  It's in the interest of justice to do so.  We have a heavy burden of proof, and in order to meet it, we need evidence that would convince this Chamber beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of Joseph Nzirorera.  And it is our contention that we will need the testimony from three additional witnesses to do that.  

We would like to add witnesses -- or to reinstate, rather, Witnesses GBV, GBG and GDG.  These are three witnesses that were previously on the list of Prosecution witnesses.  The disclosure for these witnesses is complete.  These witnesses have no connection -- or, it was our understanding that they have no connection -- or, that they have no criminal antecedents in Rwanda, that it would not be a problem with trying to locate Gacaca documents or Rwandan judicial records.  

Witness GBV and GBG testified in the first Karemera trial.  The Defence is already familiar with their evidence.  They have already been cross-examined by the Defence in the first Karemera trial.  Their evidence corroborates the portions of BTH's evidence on which we wish to rely.  Their evidence also corroborates evidence from GBU and from GAV and from ANU, the three other Prosecution witnesses that have already testified about events in Ruhengeri.  

It is our submission that it is in the interest of justice that this Trial Chamber hear the evidence of these three additional witnesses as Prosecution evidence-in-chief upon which it can rely to determine the guilt or innocence of Joseph Nzirorera.

There are other witnesses that we have listed that we used -- whose witness statements we used to confront BTH.  Those other witnesses -- and they are all contained on the list of 26 persons that we reviewed earlier today with Witness BTH -- would be potential rebuttal witnesses.  And I wish to draw a distinction between the witnesses that we seek to add to our witness list as providing Prosecution evidence-in-chief from those we would wish to call as rebuttal witnesses after the Defence presents its case.  

My understanding of the jurisprudence is that rebuttal witnesses do not provide evidence-in-chief to convict.  They provide evidence to rebut a development in the evidence that was adduced by the Defence, and that's exactly what has happened over the past three or four days here.  

Witness BTH, who appeared for the Prosecution in June of 2006, returned last week and continued his evidence this week and essentially provided Defence evidence.  The Defence adopted that witness as their own.  He became entirely hostile to the Prosecution to the point where he is virtually a Defence witness and we have entered the Defence phase of the trial through his evidence.  
He is not simply saying that his testimony or his prior testimony is untrue.  He is saying and adopting the Defence position that there is a conspiracy afoot in Rwanda to influence the testimony of witnesses here in Arusha.  And his evidence goes far beyond simply denying the accuracy or the reliability of what he told us back in June of 2006.   He is, for all intents and purposes now, a Defence witness.  The Defence used him to elicit additional information to advance their Defence case, which is that Prosecution witnesses across the board cannot be relied upon.  

So clearly we have entered the Defence phase of the trial.  BTH's evidence was essentially Defence evidence.  We wish to rebut that evidence.  We do not need to do that now.  We can do that at the conclusion of the Defence presentation of their case.  That is the order of presentation of evidence anticipated by Rule 85.  And we would like to be consistent with the rules on that point.  

So our current application is that this Chamber allow us to call three additional witnesses.  I spoke to two of these witnesses last week in Rwanda.  One of them has confirmed his availability to come and testify.  I did not broach the issue of actually testifying with the second witness, but I know his whereabouts and how to find him and his availability.  The third witness I have not spoken to, but I think he can be easily located.

	1749H 
MR. WEBSTER:
The timing of their testimony is something that would be determined by the discretion of this Court.  It would not have to precede the calling of Karemera's witnesses.  This is, essentially, an application driven by the exceptional circumstance, and the unexpected circumstance of BTH's recantation and the nature and content of his recantation.  It need not destruct the flow of evidence in this trial.  
	We can continue by hearing Karemera's witnesses.  And when Karemera has finished calling his witnesses, we can hear these three witnesses for the Prosecution and continue with the progression of evidence in this trial.  

We make this application not to be destructive, not to slow things down, but to promote the interest of justice, a fair adjudication of the very important issues that we have to resolve in this trail.  And it's in that spirit that I offer this application.  

We all have laboured together over the last three years.  This case virtually started nine years ago.  I would offer my thought to the Court that it is inconceivable that we should put on hold nine years of work, three years -- almost three years of work on the Prosecution case, and push aside these 
three witnesses simply because it appears to be inconvenient to do so.  Hearing three additional witnesses will not disrupt the flow of evidence in this trial.  We are not insisting upon hearing them now.  They can be heard weeks from now.  We can continue with the programme, or the order of witness appearance that this Chamber has suggested in its recent decision.  But, it would certainly be a disservice to the work that we're doing in this Tribunal if we allowed one witness, Witness BTH, to disrupt the presentation of Prosecution evidence in this case.  

So, that's my application.  Where the rebuttal witnesses are concerned, we need not address that issue now.  That's an issue to be addressed at the conclusion of Defence evidence.  It's unlikely that I will attempt -- or, that we will attempt to call all nine witnesses to provide rebuttal evidence.  That will be a strategic decision to be made at the conclusion of Defence evidence.  But, where Prosecution evidence-in-chief is concerned, there are three additional witnesses that we would like to have appear before this Tribunal, and there is ample grounds in the light of BTH's unexpected recantation that it would be in the interest of justice to hear these three additional witnesses.  

So, that's my application.  And when Mr. Robinson or the other teams respond to that, then I will continue and address the issues that are raised -- or, which may be more pertinent to moving ahead with the Karemera Defence case.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I didn't know, actually, until I heard from Mr. Webster which 
Three witnesses -- which witnesses he wants to add.  I haven't reviewed their statements.  I think this is very difficult to handle as an oral submission because there is criteria that the Prosecution has to satisfy to be allowed to vary its witness lists, including diligence and other things like that.  So, I think that really this motion has to be made in writing, and we have to be given time to respond in writing.  

But, I would like to say, in terms of whether we can move forward, that it's our position -- and we're very clear about this -- that the Prosecution case has not yet closed.  And you can't simply, by judicial fiat, declare that black is white.  The Prosecution case will close when the cross-examination of Prosecution witnesses are completed.  

Now, the sequence was that during my cross-examination -- that by the beginning of my cross-examination of Witness BDW, the Trial Chamber determined that that cross-examination was unable to be completed during the December session because the judicial records of the witness had just arrived.  And it appeared that other judicial records were also out there that had not yet been produced.  And so, you ruled that the Prosecution case would be closed once you decided the motion for admission of evidence, subject to the conclusion of the cross-examination of Witness BDW, which has not yet happened.  

In the meantime, there were motions made to re-call two witnesses, which you granted, and those witnesses have been re-called during the Prosecution case, and so that all of the evidence given by Witness BTH still took place during the Prosecution case.  And it's our submission that the Prosecution can't call rebuttal witnesses after the Defence has rested when the evidence it wishes to rebut came during the Prosecution's case.  

So, if Mr. Webster doesn't want to move to vary his witness list by adding those people he now thinks he can call on rebuttal, he can make that decision, but I'm putting him on notice that it would be our position that it would be improper for any of those witnesses to be heard in the rebuttal case, and that if he truly wants to bring them, he needs to bring them now as part of his motion to vary the witness list. 

We completely object to proceeding with the Defence case before the Prosecution case is closed.  We know of no precedent in either this Tribunal, the ICTY, the Special Tribunal for Sierra Leone, which has required the Defence to answer a case which is not yet complete.  And we don't think that the Trial Chamber has the power to order that.  And, therefore, we ask that the Defence case not commence until witness BDW's cross-examination has conclude, until any pending motion to vary the Prosecution's witness list has been disposed of.  

Thank you.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I would like to support the arguments outlined by my learned friend, Counsel Robinson, because the Prosecutor, as you know, is basing himself on Rule 85 of the 
	Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  And this rule refers to the production of evidence on the part of the Prosecutor, and these are, therefore -- this is, therefore, Prosecution evidence we're talking about.  And in order to circumvent the difficulty, he talked about rebuttal witnesses.  So I'd like him to show me precisely where in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence there is mention made of rebuttal witnesses. 

So, I think that the true issue today lies with the fact that the Prosecutor realises that BTH's testimony seriously affects the entire system of evidence -- and I repeat, the entire system of evidence.   

And I must admit that I have been a lawyer for 27 years now, and this is the very first time that I have seen in a trial where we can see only too well that the witness -- witnesses have been provided false testimony, and the Prosecutor has not even thought about withdrawing his indictment.  And I understand only too well why today he would like to call further witnesses, because he knows only too well that what BTH has said not only concerns Mr. Joseph Nzirorera, but the entire system of evidence.  

And you will have noted, Mr. President, Your Honours, that in order to counter what BTH has said, we have gone to seek the person who recruited the witnesses in order to try and contradict what that witness said.  However, there is a problem.  We are administering justice here, and I think we should act in good faith.  My sentiment today is that the Prosecutor has, in some form, helped what we would call here false testimony, because I have been shocked when the witness said that the Prosecutor called him his friend.  

This is all very revealing.  And I think that what we should do here, Mr. President, in order to maintain the integrity of the trial itself is to have a true investigation led on the subject so that we can find out precisely how the Prosecutor has managed to come up with such witnesses, because he does have an obligation to provide us with all exculpatory evidence, and not produce witnesses which, for the most part, are those who are either being prosecuted or who are detainees in Rwanda, and who are, therefore, under constraint of some sort or another.  

So, I believe that the Defence case cannot commence until the Prosecutor has not finished his case.  And, secondly, he needs to be accompanied, because we do not want him to bring further witnesses who are going to provide further false testimony.  And this is why, Mr. President, if you grant this motion of the Prosecution, this would presuppose, therefore, that he finish his case entirely and that he close it, and that parallelly (sic) there'd be a serious investigation left to find out exactly under what circumstances these witnesses come here to testify.  

And, I thank you.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I would like to fully support what has just been said.  And I would like to say that we have had the experience of an amended indictment according to experience and, of course, over the last ten years, the list of appearance is adapted to the various Defence cases.  And we have had a situation that has evolved according to the obstacles that the Prosecution has come up against.  

Now we're talking about closing the Prosecution case when he deems fit.  And now there seems to be witnesses on his list who will then appear to corroborate evidence of prior witnesses.  And it seems to that there -- seems to be here a two-speed trial, one speed for the Defence and one speed for the Prosecution, and the trial also where the Prosecutor has free scope to have appear witnesses who he has brought out of lists -- or, order of appearances that were announced five years ago and that he gave up on, and with a view to really avoiding or circumventing the obstacles that he comes up against.  

A case is either open or closed.  Is his case open or closed?  And if it is still open, then the Defence case cannot commence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We decided to take time to consider this decision.  We don't accept Mr. Robinson's proposal of ordering that the submissions be made in writing.  We think that the arguments that you have, have been advanced, and we will consider them and make a decision as soon as we can.  

Mr. Webster, you said you had another point that you wanted to argue?  
MR. WEBSTER:
	Yes, and this is returning to the issue of how we position ourselves on Monday.  Now, I've received 	the Chamber's four decisions.  It seems to me that there are two that affect how we proceed on 	Monday.  The decision ordonnance relative à la présentation des -- of the - the order concerning 
	the -- Karemera's presentation of evidence where there are 15 witnesses listed in the order and the 	Chamber has given us some guidance as to the time.  
	
	And my enquiry -- now it's an enquiry; it's really not a submission anymore because the Chamber has 	clarified some issues -- is that:  Are we to understand, definitively, that this is the final Karemera 	witness list and that there are no other witnesses to be called?  That's what is implied in the 	Chamber's decision, but I'd like some clarity on that specific point, because Madam Diagne --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster.  Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is -- your putting the question like that is very provocative, because I remember that we had to do a lot of work with you to get you to describe anything as your final witness list.  Now, we have made an order as that; that is the witness list.  And we have indicated in our order that if the party wishes to, they have to make an application for their variation.  But, we have a witness list, and that's a witness list that exists in the trial now.  And the case is going to proceed on that witness list, unless there is another order.  But, you can't ask us to make a statement which prevents us from making another order if it's in the interest of justice requirement.  But, right now, that is the witness list that binds the case until or unless there is any subsequent ruling.

1810H   
MR. WEBSTER:
That's the only clarification I was seeking, Your Honour.  So, you've actually answered the question I was asking.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Thank you.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
I am sorry, Mr. President, to be on my feet at the same time as my learned friend.  I think, at this point in time, and this is a suggestion, Mr. Webster sought a clarification and he said that he has had that clarification.  

Now, with regard to Karemera's team, which is directly concerned, this adds to our confusion.  I would like to propose a method to the Trial Chamber so that we can be able to move forward.  In view of 
what -- what you have said is not totally clear and I -- we would like to respectfully request some clarification because if we are to seek authorisation to vary our witness list, as -- and if you deem that we should repeat the exercise, then Karemera's team will respectfully request you, Mr. President and Your Honours, to guide us and to show us the path to take, because we have to ask for this at this point of the procedure, because we filed a list for varying the witness list on the basis of Rule 73 ter. And right now, at this point, we are in the dark, and I am submitting this application for and on behalf of my client, Mr. Édouard Karemera.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I am not sure if I completely understand Madam Diagne's application because it seems to me that the Chamber has just clarified the very issue that we both raised.  But I'll allow the Chamber to respond to her, and perhaps when that happens, I will have a greater understanding of where we stand.  But I am simply relying on what the Chamber just said in response to my enquiry which is that these (inaudible) are the witnesses that we will deal with for the Karemera Defence case, as of now.  

If you look at witness number one -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, the reason why I answer it the way I did is that the Karemera Defence team had made an application to vary the witness list in relation to some 65 witnesses, and we dismissed the application because it did not provide the information that we thought was necessary for us to exercise our discretion.  And in that motion, I think that we explained -- I hope we explained sufficiently clearly the reason why we took that decision, and I think that we indicated that they were at liberty to make an application.  So we know that if they are serious that they will be asking for a variation.  We don't know what our decision will be, but I expect that they will provide the kind of information that will enable us to make a decision.  And I thought that was apparent from the way in which their application was made and the way in which we responded to it.  

Now, what Ms. Diagne is saying now is that she still doesn't fully understand what it is we expect to get from her.  So I will just give her a brief indication.  I don't think that it is our role to provide legal advice, and it's not in that spirit that I want to make these remarks, but I think that it is in the interest of the overall conclusion of the trial to provide a little information which may assist in the overall management of the trial.  So I would like to attempt to say a word or two which may assist in relieving the problems that she had just referred to.  

And the basic point, Madam Diagne, is that you had made an application for an order for protection, and we had given you liberty to withhold the identifying information of your witnesses until 30 days before the commencement of this trial session.  Now, that 30-day period has elapsed and you are obligated at this stage to provide identifying information of any person who is going to be a witness.  So we cannot adjudicate on an issue of expansion of your witness list unless that information is provided, among other things.  

Now, our -- our order specifically advised that the presentation of such information can be dealt with confidentially so that the identification will not be made public, and when we receive the information, the Chamber will then determine whether, and in what way the information could be shared with the Prosecutor or the other parties in the case.  

So, if it is, in fact, your intention to call any additional witnesses, you will have to provide the adequate information, as I had indicated, and the Chamber will then consider the application.  And I thought that that was already clear in the way in which the decision was expressed.  But I don't know if that provides the clarification that you sought. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, thank you for your clarification, which is very useful.  I would also like to tell you and reassure the Bench that I am not ashamed when I receive legal advice from experienced experts in law.  But I will also like to say, Mr. President, that the confusion still remains, because Karemera's team considers that the Trial Chamber is the body which has the required information, and we are aware that the Trial Chamber is making sure that the Prosecution will not have access to confidential information without the proper time -- outside the proper -- the required time.  And with the spectacle which we have witnessed in the last few days on the part of Prosecution witnesses, as well as acts on the part of the Prosecutor, has made us -- all these things have made us believe that there is some information which should remain confidential, on the part of the Defence.  Of course, the 
Trial Chamber has to have access to all the information.  And we, Karemera's Defence team, we've done everything to see to it that such information was available and accessible to the Trial Chamber.  
The decision which you referred to, which we went through during the 15 minutes break, also states somewhere -- states somewhere that the Trial Chamber has assured Ngirumpatse's and Nzirorera's Defence teams that a scenario of --  involving disclosure of such information is something that can be envisaged.  And, at this point, Mr. President, I would like to recall why at no point did Mr. Karemera's Defence -- did not benefit from this kind of protection, which is a basic protection, which should be extended to its evidence, and also ensure the integrity of the procedure.  

Mr. President, when I say that this information has been submitted to you, I believe that I am right.  I think that, in my opinion -- and I think that I am right here as well -- I think that the Trial Chamber has all the information concerning the list of my 65 witnesses, and that is why I thought that I should seek some clarification from you.  And that is why, Mr. President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are not joking.  We are pretty serious and we are trying to do our best and to be fair to everybody.  I just told you that we don't have the information.  Now, if you send it to us, and -- could you indicate to us when and how it was sent so we can make an investigation?   Because if you sent it, well, then, we will deal with it.  So if you can give some information as to how and when it was sent, we will check and address that very quickly.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I would like to say and reassure you that I am not joking.  This is too serious a case for me to joke, and I would not like the Trial Chamber to think that I am making humour out of this.  And it is not at all fitting for me to make humour of such a situation.  Now, I do not think that I should do so now.  

My professional conscience does not allow me to say how I sent to you the information relevant to my witnesses.  I have no secrets with my Defence teams here, because they are capable of saying that they do have access to my data.  But I cannot say this before the Prosecutor, because if you allow the other teams to communicate ex -- or, disclose ex parte information with reference to their witnesses, I believe that I should also be able to benefit from the same treatment.  

And I will tell you, Mr. President, because it is in my habit to say, that I am not making fun of the situation, and -- nor am I inventing things, and I can prove to you exactly how I sent this information to you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Diagne-Mbaye, you don't have to speak anymore.  We will check.  We will check again.

1825H 
MR. PRESIDENT (continued): 
I am sorry, Ms. Diagne.  I misunderstood you.  Your complaint was that you didn't know before this current order that you could have filed information ex parte.  Is that what you are saying?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
The translation I just heard means absolutely nothing to me, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  There is a little bit of -- apparently, on the Bench, we heard slightly -- or, we understood slightly different things during your last presentation, and I just wanted to clarify what you were saying.  Is it that you are saying that you did send information to the Trial Chamber, information which we didn't notice, which requires us to go and look again to see if we received it, or are you saying that you did not send it because you didn't know you could have sent it confidentially?  So we didn't understand what -- what we -- there is a little bit of doubt as to what you actually said.  So, could you clarify?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, I said that the information was disclosed -- has already been disclosed.  And, Mr. President, I would like to recall that you publicly took the decision here, in the presence of WVSS, and always in the presence of a representative of the Trial Chamber, that we should work together on all the information referring or relevant to our witnesses. 

Now, Mr. President, when the entirety of my team attended this meeting with WVSS, with 
two representatives of the Trial Chamber, do you believe, Mr. President, that today I can consider that the Trial Chamber does not have any information on my witnesses?  
MR. PRESIDENT:   
I understand what you are saying now.  Give us one moment, please.  

Ms. Diagne, we now gather the issue to which you are referring, and I suppose the easiest way to respond is to explain to you that communications to the registry, or to a section of the registry, is not 
the -- does not satisfy the issue of communicating to the Trial Chamber.  So we now understand the reference to which you mean, but it is necessary to file that information. 

Now, it was our intention to grant you permission to file it in a manner which protected the identity from being revealed to the public.  We also intend that in relation to those potential witnesses, in respect of which no protection order has already been granted because the application is pending or is being made at this late stage, we intended that in the application process, that the identifying information could be filed ex parte, so that the Chamber, after considering whether protection is made, or that we can decide whether and on what terms disclosure should be granted to the Prosecutor.  But such an application needs to be filed with the Chamber, through CMS.  

And we have -- I thought that we had specifically indicated that it could be filed in a manner that the public does not have access to it, and that the Prosecutor does not have access to it, except as we might order. 

Now, if that has not been clear in the decision that we already made, we make that order now, because that is what we expect to occur. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President -- Mr. Prosecutor, I have not finished clarifying my point.  

Mr. President, I believe that, indeed, the error comes from there.  This opportunity had never been offered to us in the past, and we had tried to see, or ascertain what the best way was to reach that result without disclosing, but we didn't have a specific order from the Trial Chamber itself.  And this is the first time that this is expressly said in a decision.  And this concerns the teams of Mr. Nzirorera and Mr. Ngirumpaste.  And that is the specification or clarification that Mr. Karemera's team would like to bring to the Trial Chamber.  

We are taking note of your order, and we shall comply with it immediately, because that is also our way of dealing with things. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Well, Your Honour, I'm a bit confused by the conversation because this is something that does not involve the Prosecution at all.  And I don't quite understand, and maybe the Chamber could extend us the same indulgence in terms of explaining matters a bit.  But it seems to me that Ms. Diagne is 
simply -- is given permission to file an ex parte witness protection motion when this Chamber has already decided her witness protection motion.  So, procedurally, I'm at a loss to understand what is happening. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, the problem is this, right:  The Chamber -- the Trial Chamber has run into a lot of difficulties in managing the commencement of the Prosecution case -- managing the commencement of the Defence case because of problems occurring towards the end of the Prosecution case.  And the problems have occurred to such an extent that we are now going to have to adjudicate on the issue as to whether the Prosecution case is closed or not.  So we feel that it is necessary for us to exercise aggressive management strategies to ensure that there is not inordinate delay or damage to what we consider is proper progress of the trial. 

Now, we have observed that the Karemera Defence team made attempts to get protection orders for their witness -- or, some of their witnesses very late.  And we have made our adjudication in relation to the information that they have actually provided.  

We also noticed that they -- that they had given notice of an intention to call additional witnesses in relation to which no orders have been made. 

Now, the Chamber could do one of two things.  We could sit back and wait and allow the trial process to be delayed, or we can try to see in what way we can ensure that the management issues, which are necessary to propel the case forward, are addressed.  And we have attempted to do that. 

The issue with the commencement of the Karemera Defence case requires making orders to guarantee that the witnesses that they require start, and we want them to start next week.  And we don't want there to be a delay in the flow of witnesses.  And we have made the orders which we think will facilitate that process. 

Now, in general, applications for protection are filed ex parte, and the Chamber would exercise discretion in determining whether, and under what circumstances identifying information is provided to the other party.  So we didn't think it was necessary to wait for an application to make such an order when we want to have the matter progressed as quickly as possible.  It's the -- and so we have decided, on our own initiative, to indicate to the Defence that that is how they could proceed. 

We have made it clear to them that no protection order will include a provision authorising -- authorising withholding of identifying information, unless exceptional -- disclosure to the parties in the trial, the withholding of identifying information, unless special reasons are given.  And I think that's clear in our decision. 

But we think that they have to be protected from exposing to the public the identifying information of the witnesses whom the application is applied for, and they have to be protected from exposing that information to the Prosecution. 

If the witnesses are going to get protection, the Prosecution should not have that information until we have made an order restricting the way in which they can manage that information.  So what we have, and what we have ordered, is to facilitate moving forward in that manner. 

MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I respect the Court's concern for moving the case ahead.  We all share that concern.  
My concern is being able to confront these witnesses when they are brought.  And if we don't have identifying information, we won't be able to do so.  In application -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you hear what I just said?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I heard you.  I didn't understand everything. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, let me explain something.  I just explained that the protection order -- we explained in our decision that because of the time, the fact that 30 days has already elapsed from the commencement of the Defence case, no protection order will include the right to withhold identifying information from the Prosecution, unless special cause is shown.  

There might be a reason why anonymity should be granted.  We don't know it yet.  But they have the opportunity to ask and to try to persuade the Chamber. 

The normal protection order that is granted, which is to withhold identifying information until 21 or 
30 days before the commencement of the case, that particular order cannot be applicable, because the Defence case is starting already.  But we still have to provide basic protection to the witnesses in the manner in which I had explained. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
All right.  I'm simply bringing to the Court's attention that in several applications - or, several submissions, I should say, the Prosecution conceded that in order to expedite matters, the Defence should be accorded provisional protective measures.  So keeping the information from the public is not a problem for us because that's what will allow the wheels to move forward, but what concerns us is having an opportunity to investigate these witnesses.  And we cannot do that effectively without knowing who they are.  

The summaries that Maître Diagne has provided with us -- has provided to us are wholly inadequate.  Of the 15 witnesses, or so, that are listed, probably only two have adequate summaries, by any reasonable standard. 

For the first witness, LLK, a witness that we learned of for the first time on the 14th of April, just three days ago, the summary is wholly inadequate.  We don't know what this witness is going to say.  If this is the witness that is brought on Monday, or on Tuesday, we will hear the witness's direct-examination, but the Prosecution is simply not ready to cross-examine this witness.  
We learned who this witness is for the first time three days ago.  The summary doesn't tell us anything.  There is no witness statement.  There is no disclosure.  It does not make -- it's not reasonable to think that there is some sort of equality between the Defence and the Prosecution, given the volume of disclosure that we've had to make far in advance of the commencement of the trial.  Witness statements, judicial records, pre-trial brief that goes into details, these are practical issues.  And I can understand, it's frustrating.  It's frustrating for us, as well.  But simply devising a means for the Defence to provide information to the Chamber ex parte is not going to solve the problem, because when the witness gets here, we will not be ready to confront the witness.  So the Chamber has to devise another means. 

We suggested that the Defence be granted provisional protective measures so that information need not be shared with the public, but certainly the Prosecution should be able to know who the witnesses are and what they are going to say.  So we -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, it's obvious that you don't understand English properly.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Is it a question of understanding English?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It sound so to me. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
No, because this Court has consistently insisted that there should be a level of decorum, and that should apply for the Bench as well.  I have never accused anyone of not understanding English. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, I have just said something in English, and you are pretending as though I didn't say what I said.  So there must be a question of comprehension involved here. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
There is a question of -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Unless it's a question of rudeness. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Rudeness on my part?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, of course.  That's what I am saying. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay, well --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I suggested that it might be a question of comprehension.  If it's not a question of comprehension, 
then it's a question of rudeness.  

I just said a few minutes ago that we had made in our order, a copy of which you have got, unfortunately, it's in French, but I said in English that we expressly ordered that none of the protective measures granted would include an order of withholding identifying information from the Prosecution, unless special reasons were given. 

Now, I have just said that again in plain English and with an attitude.  Now, do you understand me?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
That point has never been in dispute.  What is of concern to us is, in several applications we have indicated that there is not enough information for us to effectively confront the witness, so that's what I'm bringing to the Court's attention.  So when we resume on Monday or Tuesday with the first witness, the question for us will be:  Can we hear his direct evidence and then postpone the cross-examination?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, Mr. Webster, you will have to make an application.  You can't just come and tell the Court that you are not going to cross-examine.  This is a matter which has happened very often in the Prosecution case.  On each occasion an application has been made, and we have made a decision that the interest of justice required.  So if that situation develops, we would expect that you would make an application; we would consider the issue; and if the interest of justice requires a postponement of your cross-examination, you will be granted.  

Now, that also is stated in our order, because in our order you had specifically requested that the proceedings be postponed for this purpose, and we specifically stated in the order that we didn't think that the proceedings should be postponed for that reason because there were other remedies which we could grant to alleviate the situation.  And you have had ample experience where the remedy of postponement of cross-examination is an option which the Trial Chamber has exercised from time to time. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Well, that's understood, and it's clear that we will have the opportunity to make that application on Monday, or Tuesday, or whenever the Defence's case begins.  But my understanding of the purpose of this status conference was to anticipate difficulties, and it's in that spirit that I put the issue before the Chamber because I thought we were trying to strategise to make everything that goes on next week more productive.  So that's why I made that comment.  Not for you to resolve the issue on the spot now, but this is an issue that's going to arise next week, and I thought it was my responsibility to bring that before the Chamber as a precautionary measure. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's now quarter to seven.  
Yes, Mr. Weyl?  

We are going to have to adjourn now because it's just too late.  The question is, do we continue tomorrow morning?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, that was my concern because I am really confused.  As I am travelling tonight, I would like to be excused, but after saying two words regarding our concerns.  Firstly, the seriousness of the decisions which have been taken leads me to consult my late counsel because we need to consult all members of the team of Mathieu Ngirumpaste. 
(Pages 16 to 22 by Joe Reynosa)




























1845H 
MR. WEYL (continued): 
The second one -- my second comment concerns our perception of the situation when there is a delay on disclosure on the part of the Prosecutor during the Prosecution case.  We heard in each and every session the issue of 30 days being raised because the Prosecutor disclosed material only 30 days prior to the commencement of session, and it concerned groups of witnesses session after session after session.  So I think 30 days concerns (microphones overlapping) -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)...Mr. Weyl, can I -- I'm sorry to cut you across because we understand -- I understand the point that you're making, and we took that into consideration when they were considering what to do.  

Now, it is true that when the case first started, the protection orders included the provision of making the disclosure only 30 days before the trial session.  But in reality, that -- that order was bypassed by circumstances, and the -- we did not find it necessary to intervene, because, in general, all the disclosure was made in relation to the witnesses who are testifying at the time our trial had commenced.  So the Defence did have ample information.  

The problem was that the information provided by the Prosecutor was not complete.  And we have had to, from time to time, make special provision to deal with the incompleteness of the disclosure.  But, in a general sense, the basic disclosure for all witnesses had been provided several years before the witnesses testified.  So we do not think that we have done anything in this order which is unequal between the parties.  We think that what we -- the order we have made is fair, it's taken the interest of the Accused into account, and we think it has imposed a regime which is not dissimilar to the regime which we had managed when the Prosecution case was in progress.  So that is how we looked at it, and I think that that's an explanation which I think arises from the question which you are -- which you are raising.  

Unfortunately, we are obliged to close our session now.  There are rules requiring -- requiring the security issues which make it -- I think we are already past the stage of permissible sessions, and we are going to have to close now.  

We are going to continue tomorrow morning early.  If -- 
MR. MORLEY: 
I'm sorry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley?  
MR. MORLEY: 
If we're continuing tomorrow morning, I'll sit down.  I just wanted to give everybody notice as quickly as I have had it of what's happened in Gitarama.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.
MR. MORLEY:
If I may, I can tell Your Honours and my learned friends opposite that the news from Gitarama is that the BDW letter cannot be found in the Gitarama material which has been archived from Kibuye prison.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Morley.  

Now, it is possible that we have, in fact, touched on all of the issues that need to be addressed, and what seems to be outstanding is our ruling on the Prosecution application to amend his witness list to call three additional witnesses.  Our decision on that would impact on the totality of what's going to happen next week.  

So I think that we probably could adjourn our proceedings now until Monday morning.  And, in the meantime, we will try to communicate our decision electronically.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
So my understanding is that we'll resume with BDW on Monday morning first thing and then proceed into the first Defence witness?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I just said that whether we proceed with the Defence witness or not next week may be affected by the decision we make on your application, which we have not decided as yet.  Now, we will try to decide as quickly as we can and communicate it electronically.  And that decision would contain some directions as to how we will proceed next week.  We don't know yet what our decision would be, but we expect to give some directions when we make our decision, and we will try to communicate it electronically before Monday.  Is that clear?  Good.  

We take the adjournment now until Monday morning.
