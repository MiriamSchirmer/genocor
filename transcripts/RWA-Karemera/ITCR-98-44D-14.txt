MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session.  Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.  

Counsel for the Prosecution, could you please provide information to the Chamber regarding the health situation of Witness GVB? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Good morning, Your Honours.  This morning I spoke with Jacqueline Crawford of WVSS and I asked about GVB's health.  She informed me that he got medication for his malaria, that he would be able to come to court, and I asked her to remain on hold, that I would give her a call at around eleven o'clock this morning and tell her whether GVB should be produced for mid-day.  I can call her before 11:00, if the Court instructs me to do so, and have him brought a little bit earlier.  But according to her, he can come to court.  But my agreement with her is to contact her by telephone by around eleven o'clock.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well then.  Thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution.  You'll inform us in due course. 

Counsel Robinson had made an oral motion for review of our 7 October 2003 decision setting a deadline for the disclosure of the identity of witnesses, at the latest 21, days prior to commencement of the session at which the said witnesses would appear.  The said motion requested the Chamber to extend the deadline from 21 days to 30 days.  

Counsel for the Prosecution, do you have any objection to that motion by Counsel Robinson? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, Your Honour.  I think that the Court's previous decision that provided a time limit of 21 days was appropriate under the circumstances.  The fundamental issue for us is not one of the logistics of providing disclosure to the Defence; it's for the security and the safety of the witnesses.  That is still a concern.  And my suggestion is that the Court maintain its previous order and that only 21 days be allowed for the disclosure of the identity of witnesses.  

Having said that, however, I understand Mr. Robinson's concern, and the Prosecution team would be willing to provide the disclosure of the identity 30 days ahead of time, as he suggests, preferably at the end of the previous court session, where there is only a month between sessions.  We would do that on a consensual basis, as opposed to having the Court order us to do it, and I suggest that we do it on a consensual basis because, in some instances, there is more of a concern for witness security than others.  

For example, when we have a detained witness who is brought to us from the prison system in Rwanda, that's the type of witness that needs extra protection.  So, for example, if we were talking about Witness GBU or GAP, witnesses that are detained in Rwanda, those are the types of witnesses that we would not want to disclose their information 30 days ahead of time, and in those instances we would not want the Court to disturb its previous decision.  But for witnesses who aren't particularly sensitive or who are not as sensitive as some of those other witnesses, we would voluntarily provide the disclosure at the end of the previous trial session, or 30 days before the beginning of the next trial session, which I believe is Mr. Robinson's application.  

So, for the record, the Office of the Prosecutor opposes that application but, of course, we defer to the Trial Chamber's judgement on the issue.  Our concern is fundamentally for the witnesses' security, and different categories of witnesses present different categories of risk, and that's really our concern.  

I remind the Court of the incident that preceded this trial session, where witnesses independent of 
Mr. Robinson's volition felt intimidated simply by his request to speak to them.  I do understand that there are a number of witnesses who are now reluctant to testify because word has been circulating that they may have been speaking to the Tribunal.  That's an inevitable consequence of investigators asking about them, and that's really our concern.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution. 

Counsel Robinson, do you have anything to say? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Very briefly, Madam President.  We're only speaking of a difference of nine days here.  The problem is that, as you've noticed, you've scheduled the sessions for 30-day intervals, and if we leave Arusha without having the material, then we don't have enough time between sessions to meet with the client, take instructions about the new material, to send our investigators out to do the work.  So when you balance the additional nine days against the need to actually be prepared for the session without disrupting the sessions because we haven't been able to work with the disclosure, I think the correct balance would be to give the additional nine days and to order that the material be provided to us at the last -- by the last day of each session.  

I also wanted to make an order -- an application this morning for an order with respect to the second session.  It doesn't deal with the unredacted statements, but it deals with the list of witnesses for the second session who are to be called.  And my application is that you order the Prosecutor to provide a list by Wednesday, the 10th of December, and that would be a list of all of the witnesses to be called in the second session, which appears to be about eight weeks in duration, and in the Prosecutor's best effort to indicate the order in which those witnesses would be called.  
The reason I ask for that is because we have to organise ourselves here in the Defence before we disperse from Arusha, so we need to know who the witnesses are going to be.  We can accumulate the redacted statements that we already have from these witnesses.  We can divide the work among the team.  My co-counsel will come for certain witnesses and will not be here for others, and that's a saving of funds for the Tribunal.  So we need to know who is coming and when they're coming before this session ends so that we can properly prepare ourselves to be ready for the next session.  

And my final request in that regard is that you order the parties to meet with the senior legal officer, Mr. O'Donnell, at three o'clock on next Friday, the 12th of December, so that we can have the same process that we had before the first session, to iron out the details of missing disclosure and other problems, which I think was very useful for everyone in enabling this session to go as smoothly as it is with respect to witnesses.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Counsel Robinson.  

Yes, Prosecutor.
MR. WEBSTER:
That seems reasonable to me under the circumstances.  I would, however, have preferred to provide the final list to the Defence on Thursday, and then we could have a meeting.  I would prefer to have the meeting on Thursday evening as opposed to Friday, but if we delivered the list of materials on Thursday morning and met at the end of the court session or after we conclude our business on Thursday, I think that would be more convenient, personally, for us.  There are a number of issues, for reasons that are internal to the OTP.  But in every other respect, I think it's a reasonable suggestion that the parties meet to work out the modalities of disclosure and the details of disclosure for the next court session.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution.

The Chamber takes note of the remarks of the Prosecutor.  We will subsequently in the day inform you of the date and the time of the informal meeting that will be held here between the parties.  We need to, first of all, contact the jurist who will chair that meeting.  For now, we will deliver our decision on Mr. Robinson's motion. 

The Chamber was seized on the 27th of November 2003 of an oral motion by Mr. Robinson, lead counsel of Mr. Nzirorera, for review of the decision taken by the Chamber on the 7th of October 2003 ordering the Prosecutor to disclose the identity of witnesses who would be called at trial, at the latest, 21 days before commencement of the session during which the said witness would testify. 
Counsel Robinson requests the Chamber to order the Prosecutor to fulfil its obligations at the end of each session; that is, 30 days prior to the session at which the witness is supposed to testify.  This would enable the Defence teams to consult with their clients before leaving Arusha and organising their investigations.  

The Chamber has considered the practical issues raised by Mr. Robinson and is of the opinion that they are well founded.  Bearing in mind the lack of formal opposition from the Prosecutor, the Chamber invites the Prosecutor to disclose to Defence the identity of witnesses to testify 30 days before the commencement of the session at which the witnesses would testify, except in exceptional cases that would be referred to the Chamber in advance. 

That is the decision of the Chamber, and we are of the opinion that during that informal meeting, in view of the fact that there will be a break that will be a little more than 30 days, the parties will reach a consensus as regards the list of witnesses.  That problem would also be resolved because the Prosecutor is ready to provide that list on Thursday morning; that is, the list of witnesses requested by Counsel Robinson. 

We shall now continue the cross-examination of the witness.  A minute, please. 

We have been informed that Mr. O'Donnell is ready to meet the parties either on Thursday or on Friday, provided the meeting is held during working hours and that the meeting doesn't extend beyond 6:00 p.m.  So you could contact him to fix a date and a time for the meeting. 

Before we proceed, we would like to state that we have taken a decision, with a view to managing our time more judicially in this trial.  We would therefore advise that cross-examination should not last longer than examination-in-chief.  We can tolerate a slight extension of the time, but it should not last twice the time in examination-in-chief.  This will be valid for both parties; that is, for the tendering of Prosecution evidence and also the tendering of Defence evidence.  

We shall now give the floor to -- we shall now give the floor to Counsel Hooper, who was 
cross-examining the witness. 

Counsel Hooper, we ask that you should take all necessary measures to complete your 
cross-examination in two hours, at the most. 
MR. HOOPER:
Am I to understand, Madam President, that's two hours from now, from half past 9:00?  It is.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, that is it. 
MR. HOOPER:
May I say that I'm unaware of any national or international practice that so limits cross-examination?  May I say that if this Court is concerned with ascertaining the truth, then I will need longer than the time that is being allocated to me this morning?  May I also observe that that decision has been taken without the least judicial inquiry into what the matters are that I have available to me to put to this witness?  In other words, this is a decision that appears to have been taken, frankly, blind.  I'm very concerned about this departure from practice.  We will be seeking, in writing, a certification of appeal because this is quite plainly a matter that strikes root and branch at the very basis of a fair trial, at the very basis, in fact, of a defendant being able to effectively participate in a process which is founded, as it is here, on an adversarial system and arises, in my submission, from a total misconception by the Court of the function, role and nature of cross-examination. 

I say also that I will not be able to put matters to this witness that are necessary to put.  I mention also that the Prosecution, in effect, have as long as they need with a witness.  I mention also that 
cross-examination is a different species of taking a witness through evidence.  The Court should be aware that an examination-in-chief is essentially a recital of fact, and, indeed, in this Court a practice is tolerated, as it is in the United States but nowhere else, where the witness is effectively teed up, that is, rehearsed, before the witness comes into Court, by the Prosecution.  Then there's a recital of evidence.  

In this case, Madam President, there are 11 Prosecution statements made by this witness as part of the evidence.  She may not have referred to it, but it's there, and it's evidence to which I necessarily need to respond. 

I noticed yesterday, Madam President, that you said to me that there hadn't appeared to have been many questions arising as by way of cross-examination out of the evidence in-chief.  It struck me as a misconception of what cross-examination was.  I think if you look at the record, there are very few questions that were not, in fact, arising directly from cross-examination (sic). 

Secondly, there's the issue of credibility.  This is the principal role of the adversarial system, when one, in fact, is confronted with a witness.  I have to address that. 

Thirdly, for a witness to say that "X murdered Y" takes but a sentence.  It takes a lot more than that to, in fact, unravel and get, I hope -

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, please, you are speaking too fast and the stenographers are unable to note down all what you're saying.  I also believe that all this is not very relevant, so please try to be brief and concise and speak a bit slowly. 
MR. HOOPER:
I won't repeat what I said.  I'm unaware -- I'll try and speak more slowly.  I'm not aware what was lost by the speed with which I was speaking.  I won't repeat what I said.  But I am, Madam President, deeply concerned at this introduction of a practice which --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, please don't go over all what you have said.  You may continue, but all I said was that you should slow down a little and be a little more brief. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I think I've covered, I hope, the principal points of my concern about this novel practice, and I merely comment this.  There's an irony here, because I was making inquiries last night; if I was in another trial chamber, perhaps Government II, as I could easily be, I suspect I wouldn't be subject to this restraint, to this guillotine.  It's a strange reflection that, in fact --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I believe you've already given your reasons.  You are referring to Chamber II.  Here we are in Chamber III.  The decisions we take are founded on Rules of Evidence and Procedure of the Tribunal.  We are not deviating from those Rules.  We shall deliver our ruling, and we shall find out whether you can obtain certification for appeal.  We shall consider your motion.  

We are losing time here now.  Please proceed to cross-examination of the witness.  

I would like to point out to you that the statements that you have mentioned were requested by you, and they were provided to you, particularly the eleventh statement, but as far as I know, those statements were not tendered in -- have not been tendered in evidence so far, and it is the duty of the Chamber to rule on what has been stated here during these hearings and not on documents which have not been tendered in evidence so far, at least.  So, please, I would recommend that you concentrate on what has been said during this session in your cross-examination.  We thank you, Counsel, and you may proceed. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you.  May I just add that I had spoken to my Brother Counsel here and I asked them, before you peremptorily, in fact, introduced this rule without consultation with any of us, whether, in fact, in the circumstances in which we found ourselves today, knowing that I was, in fact, possibly facing some restriction, whether if, in fact, I dealt with all the matters extensively with this witness, they would be minded to take up Court time by further questions.  And they told me, to that, no, they wouldn't, that that won't necessarily be the position if, in fact, I am guillotined, which is what is happening, and I think that's -- so, in other words, the Bar here is seeking to save time.  

This is, obviously, principally a witness relating to me, but others have a right to cross-examine, and they defer to me and in circumstances, that is, where I can put all the matters that are necessary. 

I don't know where I stand now.  Is it two hours absolute?  Am I going to get to 25 to 11:00 and -- 25 to 12:00, is it?  No, half past 10:00, half past 11:00 -- 25 to 12, half past 11:00, and then find myself engaging in further argument, making further requests to the Tribunal, when perhaps I may have other matters that need to be put?  And these aren't light matters.  

One matter I didn't raise, which I can perhaps briefly touch on, is this:  I did ask for severance in this case.  It's because I'm not severed that I feel I'm being subjected to this whipping on because of the anxiety the Tribunal has with two ad litem Judges to finish the job in hand in time with four defendants, and if I had not, in fact, been joined, if I had been severed, I cannot conceive of a reasonable tribunal interfering with a principal witness making allegations of murder and heinous crime in this hospital, interfering with my right to present the case, which is all I'm asking to do.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Roach, very briefly, please, because we are wasting a lot of time with all that has been said.
MR. ROACH:
Yes.  I hope I'm not wasting time, and I will be brief.  But I have my own concerns.  I desperately want to see this trial move smoothly along, and I know because of the novelty of this Tribunal and the historical position that we are in on this continent with this kind of case, that we should try to avoid making any serious errors.  For that reason, I should like to invite the panel, before making decisions of the nature that was made with respect to the length of time and the proportionality between 
cross-examination and examination-in-chief, to consult with counsel, with Defence as well as the others, so that we could have our experience, which I know you would value, bearing on the matter.  

Now, the Procrustean approach of putting the Defence -- or the Prosecution, for that matter, when their turn comes for cross-examination -- in a situation where we are bound by time without the factors of relevancy, the factor of probative value, and the factors of repetition and prolixity, without those factors being woven into such a decision, the decision is necessarily arbitrary.  

This decision of fixing a definite time for cross-examination is, to my experience of more than 42 years as a barrister in three different jurisdictions -- admittedly all common law -- I have never seen.  It's always related to the cogency of the issues of probative value and relevancy.  Now, the other thing that we have to take in mind is there are all kinds of technical problems:  witnesses' 
non-responsiveness, objections, and other unforeseen eventualities which have to be taken into consideration.  So I would urge that this Court has other ways of controlling its process without setting times, disregarding relevancy and probative value.  And I should like to encourage my friends here on the Defence side to be as cooperative as possible with your rulings and your -- whenever you implore us not to be repetitive or to raise questions outside of the bounds of cross-examination -- of examination-in-chief, possibly with the exception of credibility questions.  I should like to encourage -- and I'm pretty sure that we are responsible enough to govern ourselves accordingly. 

So I would conclude by saying we should like, in future, to have an opportunity, before decisions are made of such great importance, to have an opportunity to present a Defence point of view and so that you might have the benefit of our feelings and our experience.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Roach.  Please bear in mind that we are sensitive to all the issues you have raised, and if we didn't take these positions at the beginning of this trial, it was precisely because we took into consideration the issues you've raised.  But in view of the fact that we've observed some excesses in cross-examination, for example, if a witness is examined for one and a half hours and Defence requests an entire day for cross-examination, we are entitled to be concerned with the continuation of this trial, and that is why we've been setting time limits for cross-examination, and we've stated that we will proceed on a case-by-case basis.  We usually give a time frame but we don't mean to stick to it strictly.  

What we are trying to say is that Defence counsel should take the necessary measures to proceed and to use time judicially.  We have taken this decision, and we will be taking into consideration not only interruptions in the course of cross-examination as well as objections, but would also take into consideration all other matters -- other hitches that tend to reduce the time allotted for 
cross-examination.  All these will be taken into consideration by the Chamber.  I hope you'll find this reassuring.  We'd also like the proceedings to go on in a peaceful atmosphere and that they will continue without any hitches.  I thank you.  

Regarding, of course, counsel who would like to cross-examine the witness or speak after Counsel Hooper, may do so. 

Counsel Hooper, we said yesterday that you would have two hours to cross-examine the witness.  Please proceed. 
MR. HOOPER:
Is that two hours from now, Madam President?  It is.  I see a nod.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, from now on, you have two hours.
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.   
WITNESS CEA,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Which should be a little more reassurance for you, Madam Witness.  Can I come, Madam Witness, to the hospital?  You were dealing with that yesterday, and I want to come to -- because it was perhaps not entirely clear -- what happened when you arrived there.  Is it right that you went to see Gatera and found him in the open area by paediatrics and surgery?  Is that where you found him?
A.	Thank you.  Yesterday, I stated that I entered the surgery ward and that is where I met him.
Q.	So he was inside the surgery itself, inside the surgery ward itself?
A.	No, he was not inside the surgery ward, but he was very close to it, near the entrance to the ward.
Q.	Was he inside or outside?
A.	He was inside the building.
Q.	Was he with anyone?
A.	Inside the building were nurses who were providing health care to patients.  There were also other workers of the hospital who were in charge of cleaning the hospital.
Q.	When you went up, you asked him for help; was that the position?
A.	Yes, that was the case.
Q.	And his response was to hit your brother with an axe; is that right?
A.	Yes, that is what he did. 
Q.	You saw that?
A.	Yes, I saw that because I was with him.
Q.	And your brother fell to the ground, and what happened then?
MS. MAKWAIA:
Madam President, sorry to interrupt.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution.
MS. MAKWAIA:
I have the impression counsel is simply rehashing the evidence-in-chief.  Now, as he very well knows, the object of a cross-examination is to impeach the witness through contradictions or omissions, but if he's simply going to rehash the evidence in-chief, then I don't know where that will lead us.
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you, I don't really need instructions.  Thank you.  I know what I'm doing and why I'm doing it. 

BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	What happened then, please?
A.	What happened subsequently was that my brother was killed.
Q.	I understood you to say yesterday that you left, you didn't see him die; you left, but you saw his body being put in a vehicle later that day.  Was that the position?
A.	Counsel, to say that my brother died does not mean that -- actually, he was taken away with other bodies and thrown inside a mass grave that had been dug up -- that had been dug for that purpose. 
Q.	I understand what you say, but I'm just confirming what you said yesterday was that he was taken away that day.  Is that right?  And that was something you saw, was it?
A.	Yes, I witnessed it.
Q.	Did you see the vehicle that his body was put on?
A.	The vehicle on which they loaded the bodies of other Tutsis, other refugees, is the same vehicle where my brother's body was placed.
Q.	Did you see that vehicle?
A.	Yes, I told you that I know the vehicle.  It was a red pickup.
Q.	Was yesterday the first time you mentioned or described the vehicle as a red pickup?
A.	No, it wasn't the first time that I described the vehicle.
Q.	Now, over the next days -- you stayed a week in the hospital.  Where did you hide?
A.	I stayed in the hospital buildings.  There was a tarpaulin somewhere where there were refugees.
Q.	Did you eat at all when you were in the hospital?
A.	No, I didn't eat.
Q.	You didn't eat for a week?
A.	Yes, I didn't eat for a week.
Q.	Where were your children?
A.	At home.
Q.	Who with?
A.	Where we were living.
Q.	But who were they with?
A.	With my parents.
Q.	And how old were the children?
A.	One child was born in 1991; another one in 1992; and a third in 1993.
Q.	So they were two years and one year because, of course, you'd lost one child.  So the two youngest, I take it, were the children, the babies, with your parents; is that right?
A.	That child was killed later. 
Q.	How long were you at the hospital before you saw Dr. Rwamakuba?
A.	I saw him one day after I arrived at the hospital.
Q.	You said yesterday after two days.  Is that wrong?
A.	Yesterday, I said that as soon as I'd arrived at the hospital where my brother was killed, I went to live under a plastic tarpaulin with other refugees, and then, one day later, I saw Rwamakuba. 
Q.	So that would be the next -- the day after you arrived at the hospital.  When you saw Dr. Rwamakuba, by then, of course, your brother had died, was dead, and his body had been taken away.  That was your situation, was it?
A.	Yes, I saw him after my brother's death.
Q.	And you told us yesterday that he was introduced to you and the rest of the refugees by Dr. Gatera.  Rwamakuba was introduced by Dr. Gatera; is that right?
A.	I did not say that he introduced me individually.  He brought him to where other Tutsi refugees were, and he presented him to all the Tutsi refugees there.
Q.	And how did he present him?  What did he say?
A.	In the following terms:  "We are happy to see you here at the university hospital, Mr. Rwamakuba, but I would like to point out to you that all these people here are refugees who have sought refuge here, and we are happy that you have come to our rescue."  I think it's something like that, the way he presented him. 
Q.	And he described him as Mr. Rwamakuba, did he?
A.	Yes.
Q.	How did you come to know he was a doctor?
A.	Personally, I didn't understand that he was a medical doctor, but subsequently, inasmuch as 
Dr. Gatera said that he was his colleague, I asked someone called Kayetankore, Boniface, who told me that Rwamakuba was also a doctor, but I personally didn't know that.
  THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I will spell the name Kayetankore:  K-A-Y-E-T-A-N-K-O-R-E. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	When did you have that conversation with Boniface? 
A.	Even if Boniface was a hospital employee, he was a Tutsi and targeted by the attacks, and subsequently he hid, just as did all the other Tutsi.  
(Pages 1 to 11 by Karen Holm-Porter)










	1000H
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	When did you have the conversation with Boniface?
A.	I think I must have asked the question a bit later. 
Q.	During your time in hospital?
A.	Yes, while I was at the hospital.
Q.	You stayed with Boniface, yes?  Can you describe Dr. Rwamakuba?
A.	Yesterday, when you asked me if you showed me his photograph, I answered that I couldn't identify him, because, at the time, it was not easy to look closely at someone who was committing criminal acts.  I saw Rwamakuba when he was coming to kill people at the hospital, but I didn't have time to see his stature.  I saw him when he was loading people on a vehicle to kill them, but I couldn't scrutinise him attentively.
Q.	But you saw him about five times over those days according to your evidence?  That's right, isn't it?  Can I ask you, what time of day was it that you first saw Rwamakuba?
A.	I told you that you can't ask me questions about times or dates, because no one had a watch.  Normally you can pay attention to the time when one is in a peaceful situation.
Q.	What was it, morning or midday or evening?  Can you remember?
A.	He would often move around the plastic tarpaulins where the Tutsi were, when he would take Tutsis and to kill them.  And it was raining.  So I can't tell you whether it was morning, noon or night.  It depended on the time he turned up.  He would come in the morning; he would come back in the evening.
Q.	When you told us yesterday that all - -  I mean to ask you this, the words that you said Dr. Gatare said in introducing Mr. Rwamakuba, were those things you heard yourself or was it something you heard from other people? 
A.	I personally heard those things, because I was among the refugees being spoken to.
Q.	Is it right that yesterday was the first time you told anyone, that Dr. Rwamakuba had been introduced to the people by Dr. Gatare?
A.	Yes, it was the first time here before the Trial Chamber, but I think I mentioned it to the investigators who came to question me about Rwamakuba.
Q.	We've no record of that.  Is that true?
A.	What I have just said?  I don't know if it was written in the statement, but I know that I said it.  I wouldn't come and invent that in this Trial Chamber.
Q.	Did you know when you were in the hospital that Dr. Rwamakuba was, in fact, a minister in the government? 
A.	No.  I, I never was aware of that.  I learnt that he was a minister when I came to investigate him, because we were asked questions about Minister Rwamakuba.  But before that, I did not know that he was a minister.
Q.	The next day, so that would be day three on your account today.  You saw Rwamakuba come back, and he asked for identity cards, and Tutsis selected, were put in the red pickup truck.  Is that the position?
A.	He came to ask people to show their identity cards. Those who didn't have an identity card were loaded on a pickup to be killed.  Some were killed on the spot, and their bodies thrown into the pickup.  Others were put there and taken to be killed later. 
Q.	(Microphone not activated)
A.	Yes, I was there. I saw all of that.
Q.	Wasn't it dangerous to be there seeing things not hiding somewhere else in the hospital?
A.	I told you that there were Tutsis under that plastic tarpaulin.  Among them there, some were wounded and I was with them, I didn't hide anywhere else, I was still there.
Q.	And where was that?
A.	You are asking me where the plastic tarpaulin was set up?  The plastic tarpaulin was set up between the surgery, the paediatric unit, the surgical theatre and ORL and it is paediatric unit
Q.	Of a day after that, it should be day four of being in the hospital; you said you saw Rwamakuba coming out of the operating room.  I take it you won't be able to help us as to what time of the day that was; will you?
A.	Counsel, you continue asking me questions about time, and I tell you we had no watches.  We see them - - we saw them, we saw them coming and we saw them go, but we didn't know what time it was because we didn't wear a watch.
Q.	Was it day or night?
A.	It was in the daytime.
Q.	He had a list, you said in evidence, of medical students and doctors.  How did you know what the list was?
A.	When he stepped out, he had.  I did -- he had the list in his hand, but I didn't read it to know what the names were, but he gave instructions to the hospital employees because all the hospital employees who were there only - - merely killed - - were merely killing all the refugees.  So he asked them to go and look in the wards because there were medical students, who were hidden there, and he asked them to go and search everywhere, and he said that there were Tutsi doctors also at the hospital that had to be killed.
Q.	So you saw a piece of paper but you didn't know what was on it.  That is the position; is it?
A.	He had a piece of paper in his hands and he was giving instructions to the nurses and other hospital employees but I didn't read what was written on the list, but I heard him say what he said.
Q.	Do you know who the names of any of the nurses or hospital employees?
A.	There were many employees.  Some don't work anymore.  Others have run away.  Others are in prison.  They were very numerous, but all those who were employed in the hospital at least the Hutu helped the doctors to kill.
Q.	But you can't name any who were there that day first or know their names or try to find out their names while you were there?
A.	For example, there was a lady who was supervising the nurses.  She is in prison.  She would withdraw the intravenous from the patients and her name was Scholastic Mumukabandora, Scholastica.  
Q.	(Microphone not activated) ... nurses or workers there that day when this order was given, or other days involving Rwamakuba, can you name anyone there who received these orders?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you help us by spelling out these proper names? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mukabandora, M-U-K-A-B-A-N-D-O-R-A, Scholastic. This lady is in prison.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Yes, let me move on.  On the next day, so this would be day five or six.  You saw them, I think that was reference to Gatera and Rwamakuba, come out of the maternity ward having just found on board two students; is that correct?
A.	It was three students.
Q.	Was it?  All right, three students.  Where were you, inside or outside?
A.	I was outside next to the maternity ward very near the surgical unit.
Q.	The surgical unit, is that a surgical unit for maternity?
A.	No.  It was an operating theatre where wounded people were operated on, but who have been admitted.
Q.	So was that in the main surgical block or a different a block?
A.	I was with my back to the surgical unit facing the maternity ward.
Q.	Did you see with your own eyes these students killed?
A.	Yes, I saw it with my own eyes.
Q.	And where did they fall when they were killed?  Is it inside or outside?
A.	They were taken out from the maternity ward, and killed outside between the maternity and the surgery and the surgical operating theatre block.
Q.	I thought you said yesterday that they were killed in the corridor; is that right?
A.	Yes.  They were taken out and in front of the door of the maternity ward.  So the maternity ward and the operating theatre are on the same passageway, and they were there in that passage way.
Q.	And was yesterday the first time you have told anyone of that incident in this Court?
A.	Yes, this was the first time I gave that testimony to this Tribunal, here in this Trial Chamber.
Q.	You haven't given it to anyone else, have you?  That's the first time in ten years that you have ever mentioned that; is that right?
A.	I think I also mentioned it to the investigators who came to question me about Rwamakuba.   

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry.  Could you - - because I had omitted to close my microphone - - can you repeat? 
MR. HOOPER:
I was just putting to the witness that account.  It wasn't correct. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	You next saw Rwamakuba the next day, so this will be day six, or maybe seven, even, when he came out of surgery.  The first ward he appears to have been there nearly every day that you were there for that week?
A.	I saw him on different days, but perhaps and perhaps, other people saw him on other days, but he was always there.
Q.	But you can't even describe him?
A.	But I told you I wasn't concerned with knowing or being able to identify his physiognomy in view of what he was doing, he was merciless.  He did not need to be identified in the circumstances at the time.
Q.	Do you remember how he was dressed?
A.	I have stated as to the clothes he was wearing, he was wearing overalls and boots.  It was a jacket and trousers, but I did not pay attention to the colour of the overalls.  You must try to understand me. If this man had come to give a message of calm, I could have easily identified him, describe his physiognomy, as well as, what he was wearing.  But in the circumstances obtaining, how can you expect me to describe how he was dressed and his physiognomy?
Q.	On that day when he came out of the surgery, you told us that he was ordering employees to take people out, the wounded, to the roadblock where the soldiers - - the wounded soldiers were, the soldiers in wheel chairs.  Did you ever see that roadblock yourself?
A.	Yes.  I was an eye witness of that.
Q.	Well, did you see the roadblock?  Where was it in relation to the hospital and ESO?  Let me put it this way: How far would you say that roadblock was from the hospital entrance?  That is where the director's office is and the administration offices of the hospital that you know very well?  How far from that point was the roadblock?
A.	Yesterday, I had said that from the hospital building, if you head towards the roadblock without going to the Non, NCO school, if you walk very slowly, very slowly, it takes you five minutes, but I think if you had to do it quickly, walking quickly, it would take you three minutes and if you were on a vehicle, it wouldn't take a minute.
Q.	Five hundred metres, is it?
A.	I didn't measure the distance.  I don't know if the distance would approximate what you stated, because I didn't measure it. I expressed the distance in terms of minutes. 
Q.	You expressed it very well for the reasons we know.  Now, tell me this; you know where the ESO used to be?  It's no longer there; is it?   Where, in relation to the entrance to the ESO which is now, I think a place for the re-training of soldiers, the main entrance there, where was the barrier in relation to the main entrance there to what was then the ESO and is now the place where retired soldiers are retrained?  Where was the barrier?
A.	The ESO school had two gates.  There is the gate above facing the hospital and another gate facing the road heading towards where the roadblock was.  It wouldn't take long to walk to the roadblock.  It was a very small distance.  I think that you couldn't even say the roadblock was 
15 paces from there.
Q.	Fifteen paces from where?
A.	Fifteen paces from the NCO gate which is not the gate facing the university hospital, I am talking of the main gate, that is near the Crossroads.  When you go out through that gate - --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, please, wait until the interpretation is finished.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You must make a short pause, yes.
MR. HOOPER:
I am sorry.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Did you go to the barrier yourself?  I suppose, it would have been unwise to do so, but did you go?
A.	What for?  I passed by the roadblock but I never went to stay there.
Q.	You passed by the roadblock, when was that?
A.	I was passing.  I passed by that roadblock. 
Q.	But why?
A.	I left the hospital to return to where I had been before.
Q.	Oh, to go back to Sahera?
A.	Yes.
Q.	But you don't need to go that way; do you?
A.	It was one of the ways one could go.
Q.	But it was the most dangerous way to go, wasn't it?
A.	All ways were dangerous during the massacres.  It is thanks to Mighty God that we managed to get through.  All ways were dangerous.
Q.	Did the soldiers speak you?  Did they know that you are a Tutsi?
A.	Maybe, they did know it, but my hour had not yet come.  That also goes, that is why in any case, I am a survivor whereas I am a Tutsi.
Q.	Did you speak to the soldiers there, for example?  Did they question you?
A.	They were about to ask me questions, but at that moment, other people were brought to them to be killed.  So I seized the opportunity to get out of that place.
Q.	I am leaving, I have got many more questions to ask you, but I am leaving this subject now because of the time restraints on me.  And I barely dealt with the detail, but I must observe the rule here, that has been imposed on me.  
Now, I want to turn now to the statements that you have made, and I am going to deal with these as quickly as I can.  The Judges have the statements, but it's my job to put these differences, excuse me, it's my job and duty to put some of these differences to you.  I am not going to put all of them to you because I won't have time I am going to put some of them to you.

In your first statement to investigators dated the 19 of November '97 where you described yourself as farmer, which I referred to you yesterday, is a statement that concerns the events in April, and in that statement, and I refer to page 1, and I am looking at the English version that which I think is the signed version.  And I am not in a position to put a statement to you properly as I should be able to do, because there is no Kinyarwanda.  

But when these statements are taken, they are read to you, aren't they?  And you have a chance to change things.  Is that right; isn't it?  So when you make a statement, Madam Witness, you tell your story.  Afterwards, after it has been written down, it's read back to you, and you get the opportunity to change anything that isn't right.  That's correct.  Is it not; it's yes or no?
A.	No.  I could answer your question briefly. I met many people who questioned me on several aspects of the 1994 massacres.  At times, the investigators did not come back to meet me while others did, but I had promised that on every occasion whenever I observed an error in my statements, they could come back and see me so that I could correct such errors.  I, therefore, do not know what you mean when you say you cannot read the statement to me.  I am here to testify in regard to my statement, and I am ready to clarify any doubts in my statement.
Q.	Well, all right.  Can you clarify this one.  You say in this statement, and I make a précis of it that on the 22nd of April, you went to a known killer, whose name was (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), and put yourself under his protection, and then lived in a house that was provided to you, and that at a later date, on the 5th of May, you gave a specific date again, you suffered an indignity at the hands of a man called Shalom Ntahobali.  So, there is the 22nd of April, there is the 5th of May, when do you go to the hospital?  Can you answer that, please?
A.	I will respond very briefly.  It maybe that the investigators who took down my statement, they did not properly write out what I said.

When I went to see (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), it was to ask him whether he could do something for me, and I told you that after the 19th, we went to Kabakobwa.  (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) did nothing for me instantly.  But with regard to Shalom, I said he arrived in the month of May.  He met me when I returned to that area.  Shalom was not resident in that area, in (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) house, but I went to (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) house to ask for his assistance.  But, I did not stay in his house, and that was when I left with the others.  
As for Shalom, I stated that he came in the month of May.
Q.	It is obvious, Madam Witness, looking at the statement that you speak here of going to see (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) on the 22nd, of his providing you with a house, of you staying in this house during the day.  And then a day arrives when you are attacked by Shalom at (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) house, nothing about the hospital, that's right, isn't it?
A.	But you are dealing with another statement, and that is the second statement.  I made another statement relating to the hospital.  I am answering questions that are put to me.  Please allow me to express myself.  I made mention of Shalom and made mention of the hospital but you are mixing up everything.  I answered questions that were put to me.  I could not have spoken about the hospital whereas no questions were put to me regarding the hospital.
Q.	Now, Shalom who, on the 5th of May subjected you to a grave indignity, you say in this statement that you did not know him?  Is that correct that he was a man that you knew later?
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours,.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
	Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution?
MS. MAKWAIA:
Yes, Your Honours, would counsel be allowed to cite statements to you before reading that?
MR. HOOPER:
I have taken the point.
MS. MAKWAIA:
And even for - - even for the 22nd Your Honour, it says, vers Le 22 avril. It doesn't say Le 22 avril.
MR. HOOPER:
I quite accept that.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	On or about the 22nd of April 1994, on a day which I think is the 5th of May.  The question, I am asking you say here --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The dates are indeed not very precise.  It was always on or about.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Or a day which I think was the 5th of May, but it's right as you said there that you did not know Shalom at that time.  Is that correct?
A.	I stated that that was the first time he was coming to Sahera, S-E-H-A-R-E. 
Q.	The question I have asked:  Did you know Shalom before then?
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
	Please, Counsel, during examination-in-chief, no mention was made of Shalom.  Could you, therefore, proceed to other questions, please?
MR. HOOPER: 
	It goes to credit. I hope I am not going to ask any question that isn't relevant and appropriate.  This goes to credit, the reasons you will see.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes,  but we are dealing with very painful experiences for this witness, and it is not appropriate to remind him (sic) of these tragic experiences he (sic) injured.  That is why I suggested that you should avoid referring to Shalom. 
THE WITNESS: 
	Madam President, I thank you.  But, please, I hope you bear with me.  If he has questions regarding Shalom, he could ask me then.  But for me now, I believe he is trying to distract me and to stifle me with grief.  And in so doing to make me forget why I really came here.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I have asked one question, and I will pass on, but one question was, before the 5th of May, did you know Shalom; yes or no, please?
A.	I used to hear people talking about him because he lived in Butare town.
Q.	Now, further on in this statement, you said that during the genocide, and this is towards the end, you managed to hide your babies in a big pot in the bush; is that right?
A.	Yes, that is correct, and that was at a time when I returned to the place where I had been before.  That is after having left the hospital.
Q.	So those - - these two babies stayed in the pot all day, did they, and all night?
A.	Yes, they stayed in there, in the earthen pot and by God's Grace they managed to survive.
Q.	Isn't it the case that your babies were being looked after by you and by somebody else, another lady who carried one of your babies on her back throughout this time?  Isn't that the truth of it?
A.	No.
Q.	And that you never went to the hospital at all; isn't that the truth of it?
A.	I never said that I never went to the hospital.  I went to the hospital.   Moreover, in my statements, I spoke not only about a hospital, I said in my statement that I went to the hospital, and I went on to say that I returned to Sahera.
Q.	(Microphone not activated) ... statement which the first statement you mentioned Rwamakuba.  You stated the 15th January 1998, and by this time you started making statements, haven't you in respect of Dr. Gatera and Dr. Kaguruka also?  It's correct; isn't it?
MS. MAKWAIA: 
	Your Honours, can counsel be specific, statements to whom?  The ICTR or Rwandan authorities?
MR. HOOPER:
I don't know what the ICTR have been provided.  I have seen very little.  But I am talking of the Rwandan authorities. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Is that right?
A.	I don't know the statement to which you are referring. 
Q.	I will come to that in a moment.  Let's just look at this statement.  It's a very short statement.  It's only two small paragraphs and it's full of allegations:  "In 1994", it starts, "I stayed at Butare hospital with my wounded sister for a week."  Is that true?  Is any part of that true?
A.	No.  That is not true.  You are referring to four weeks.  That is not true.  I didn't stay for four weeks in my statement.
Q.	Yes, no, for a week, sorry, one month that is okay - - you stayed there for a week but the point being you went with your wounded sister, not your wounded brother; is that right?
A.	That was the point I asked that it should rectified. I wanted to talk about my brother and not my sister.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution?
MS. MAKWAIA:
Yes, Your Honours, in the French version she said, "ma belle soeur". So there could have been errors in translations.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Yes, I will come to that.  Which is the authoritative version here?  It's the French, isn't it?  That the one that is signed?
A.	If you read my statements, clearly, you would notice that the name mentioned is that of a man, that is a boy, a male person.
Q.	 - - statement, just says, "I stayed at Butare hospital with my wounded sister."  It was my wounded sister and in the French version, "ma belle soeur".  What is the name of your belle soeur, by the way?
A.	The person who stayed with me at that place was my brother.  It was not my sister-in-law.  I am here to clarify that doubt, to make that correction in my statement.
Q.	You go on to say, "The government was based in Gitarama, but Rwamakuba often came to Butare."  So by the time you made this statement, how did you know that Rwamakuba was a minister in the government which is the reference, isn't it?  How did you know that?
MS. MAKWAIA:
No, Your Honours, that is not correct. The statement says and I am going to read it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution.
MS. MAKWAIA:
"The government was based in Gitarama but Rwamakuba came often."  It doesn't say the government was based in Gitarama and minister Rwamakuba came often.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	You say you saw them in the statement kill Tutsi doctors with their bare hands.  Who were the Tutsi doctors that they killed with their bare hands? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, have you taken note of the correction made by the Prosecutor than tit didn't talk of Minister Rwamakuba.
MR. HOOPER:
You can see what it says, Madam President.  You can provide it with the statements, I am charging through this.  I don't want to, I would much rather dwell and take appropriate time, but I have to hurry.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Which Tutsi doctors did you see them kill with your bare hands?
A.	I stated to you that I saw them holding a list containing names of Tutsi doctors and students.  But at the time of my arrival, it was said that a certain Claude had been killed.  But I didn't state that I saw him being killed.  At the time when I arrived people were saying that the said Claude had just been killed.  He was a Tutsi working at university hospital.
Q.	He is close to alive?
A.	He died.
Q.	He is not the Claude who works at CHK in Kigali?
A.	No.
Q.	Did you see, Andre Rwamakuba, kill a doctor with his bare hands; yes or no?
A.	I stated that I saw him killing students with his own hands by hitting them with an axe.  And as regards to that doctor, I stated that at the time of my arrival, people were saying that a doctor has just been killed and hey were busy looking for other people.
Q.	Your next statement is the 17th of March 1998.  And in it, you say that you saw Kanyabashi, and this I believe is the Kabuga meeting you referred to yesterday, and this is a statement made four years after the events that you saw him on the 23rd of April 1994.  Is that correct that you saw him on the 23rd of April 1994 before being sent to Kabakobwa hill?  Is that right or is it wrong?
A.	I stated to you that Kanyabashi came to see us after the 19th in Kabuga area which is situated in Sahera.
Q.	Just answer the question:  You say in this statement made four years afterwards and after careful recollection on your part then that you saw him on the 23rd of April.  Was that, were you trying to get the date right when you said that?
A.	I would request that you should read my statement carefully and to see what I stated clearly, what that the person was doing and where I saw him.  Please don't only give me the date, but give all other details as well.
Q.	But I do not have time to do that, Madam Witness. I am asking whether when you gave that date you were doing your best to get it right.  Were you?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution?
MS. MAKWAIA:
Can counsel tell us the page number that he is reading from?  That would be very helpful.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, it is not in the English and it s not in the French.  It has been left out.  It's in the handwritten French version if you care to look at it?  Why it's been left out, I don't' know.  But if you look at the handwritten French version, you will see that it says, "I saw Kanyabashi on the 23rd of April."  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Interpreters translation.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q. We will catch up with that later.  Perhaps take my word for it at the moment.  Is that right? 
MS. MAKWAIA: 
     I don't want to take counsel's word for it, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Couldn't you ask the question?
MR. HOOPER:
It's page 2, handwritten French, 5, 7, 8.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Can we've a look at it, Your Honours? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is necessary to give a copy to the other party and to the Bench as well so that we many follow because we don't have that document. 
MR. HOOPER:
We will move from this point.  That is from this gentleman here, so that Madam President could be shown it first.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Mr. Ramadhani, can I please have a look after Their Honours?
MR. HOOPER:
And this is a Prosecution statement. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will seize this opportunity to have a break to -- and could you please therefore use the time to do photocopies of this document and hand them over to the other party?

The Court is adjourned. 

MR. HOOPER:
This is a Prosecution document. It is their document.  It's not my document.
MS. MAKWAIA:  
We still want to see it, Your Honours.  We are not disputing anything yet.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Then please reproduce this document and hand it over to the parties, the interpreters and the Bench.  When we will resume all of us will look at the document.  

The session is adjourned.  
	(Court recessed at 1100H) 
(Pages 12 to 23 by Petrus Chijarira))



























	(Court resumed at 1125H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber is now resuming the hearing.  

Counsel Hooper, you have the document?  Very well.  Counsel Hooper. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, before counsel proceeds, I would like the copies to be distributed to you of this witness's statement of the 17th March 1998, manuscript in French.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could you please repeat, Counsel, there was a glitch in the French booth. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Roach. 
MR. ROACH:
Thank you, Madam President.  You might notice that my client, Dr. Ngirumpatse, is not present.  He had a medical appointment to keep, and he has no objection for the matter being proceeded with in his absence.  I am here to represent him. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Roach.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel Hooper, excuse me, this is the English booth.  The document was not entered on the record in French.  

Could Counsel for Prosecution repeat what she said about the witness statement?  It is not on the record.  There was a problem with the French booth. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
I am repeating because it was missed by the French booth.  This is the statement of this witness of the 17th March 1998.  It is a manuscript statement.  It is in French, Your Honours.  That is what I have just distributed to you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, so we see.  

Counsel Hooper, you pray proceed.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I made the point about the 23rd of April.  The two other points I would seek to make in respect to this statement, Madam Witness, is this:  You state in it that -- and I won't repeat the details -- that all of May you were effectively a prisoner of (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), and that all of June you were confined to a small house belonging to someone called Emmanuel, who had been murdered in Akaniga secteur, 
A-K-A-N-I-G-A, and you had a watchman overlooking you; is that right?  Is that where you were in May and June? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We did not hear the witness, the translation.  The witness did not have a microphone.
Madam Witness, please, can you repeat? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
I wasn't (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) prisoner.  I said that I was staying with those important Hutu as their servant.  I did all their housework, and they did anything with me that they wanted to.  You must understand what I mean by that.  You know what people did with women at that time. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Hooper, we are in open session, please be cautious that the questions you put to the witness does not reveal her identity. 
MR. HOOPER:
Indeed.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And, Madam Witness, we are all, believe me, sensitive to the indignities that were inflicted on you.  I don't dispute that at all.  But the point being that in May, you were, as it were, under the protection then of -- that's quite the wrong word, I know, but it's the word you have used -- of (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), and in June confined to the shall house in Akaniga.  That is correct, is it not, according to your account? 
A.	That house belonged to a Tutsi who had been killed in Akaniga commune.  My house was destroyed.  And those people who had put me into that house to do what they wanted with me -- and those were the people who were protecting me, the conseiller and many others. 
Q.	I simply make this point which I think you will appreciate, and that is, that in May you were in one place, all of May, and in June you were in another place.  That is correct, is it not?  According to your account, that's correct, is it not? 
A.	No.  No, that house was the one I lived in.  I only went to (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) to do what he wanted, whenever he needed me.  So I always lived in that house, but I would go wherever I was brought for their purposes. 
Q.	And just dealing with the date that appears there, of course, we don't forget that yesterday you told us that after being at Kabuga, you moved to the hill, Kabakobwa, and you were there up to four days.  Now --
A.	I said between two to four days. 
Q.	Your statement RO4 deals with the broadcast which I dealt with yesterday, and I don't dwell with that, and you quote quite specific dates there and indeed the time, 3 p.m., in the afternoon.  

And then we come to your statement RO5, which is quite a long statement, and I must deal with it extremely quickly.  You refer there to having made a statement about Rwamakuba, and you say it's not accurately recorded and must now be -- 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Can we please get the correct citation, the year the statement was made?  And we can't just refer to your statement RO5.  Can we just get the correct citation?   
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	The 7th of February, 01 and this statement concerns -- it says of the 12th -- and you repeat there events -- I am not going to go through them. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, can you repeat which statement, because we didn't actually get that.
MR. HOOPER:
Number five.  I got it as RO5.  I hope that is in your bundle as five.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Well, unfortunately, the Prosecution doesn't have that precise bundle that he created for 
Your Honours.  It would be better if he gave the dates when the statements were taken, so we don't confuse the record. 
MR. HOOPER:
As I have said, this is the 7th of February of 01, RO5. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And at the bottom of that statement -- I am sorry to revisit it -- you refer to the death of your brother, which was a terrible event.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, for the record, can we get the page number when counsel is referring to the statement, otherwise we are just lost. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	(Overlapping microphones)....anything to take up time.  This is the bottom of page 1 of the English version and it is about one-third down in the French version, and you talk about your brother being struck and you say, "I remained in the hospital."  Let me read the entire sentence.  "My brother did not die there," and then, "I remained in the hospital, taking care of him, for about two days before he died."  "I remained in the hospital to care for him for about two days, then he died."  That is a different story, Isn't it, the one you have told this Court?  And that is the question:  That is a different story to the one that you have told this Court about your very brother or sister, whatever?
A.	I don't see any difference whatsoever to say that I remained there and that he didn't die right away.  That corresponds to what I said. 
Q.	You remained there looking after him?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel was speaking at the same time as the witness, and the both cannot be heard to the microphone.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can I just put it again in its context?  "I remained in the hospital taking care of him for about two days before he died."  It is very plain what you are saying, isn't it? 
A.	In Kinyarwanda, when you take care of someone who has not yet died, you say you take care of them.  When you are caring for them that is what we say.  That is how we say it in our language.  I said it in Kinyarwanda, but I wasn't giving him care.  What I want to say is that at that time he had not yet died up until the time that he was taken away to be finished off.  So I was not taking care of him as such as in a hospital sense. 
Q.	Right.  Now, you said at the beginning of this statement that the previous statement is to be -- let me get the correct word in English -- must now be ignored.  And you then speak of Rwamakuba, top of page 2 in the English version, and immediately after the reference to the brother in the French version that I have just alluded to, you make no mention in this statement of Rwamakuba killing anyone with his hands or anything, like killing anyone himself.  That's correct, isn't it? 
A.	I said on several occasions that there were several acts, incriminating acts, committed by several persons.  I made several different statements, several different statements, acts committed by different persons.  Perhaps I mentioned Rwamakuba in passing as I was being asked a question about someone else, but I wasn't going to mention everything that I knew; it wasn't asked of me. 
Q.	You mentioned and there is reference to Dr. Kageruka and an incident involving someone called Chantell, who while she was having her baby, was abandoned by Dr. Kageruka, who was the doctor who had the responsibility for her.  And you say that you personally saw Chantell at the hospital; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.
Q.	You also refer to a man called Viyane Karenzi -- 
MR. HOOPER:
This is a midpoint really, if you found it, Madam President, it is about a full paragraph below the reference to Rwamakuba, the first reference. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	 -- who you say was a man from Sahera, who was on a drip, but doctors from the surgery department came when he couldn't produce an ID card; he was removed from the bed and he was killed.  It's another incident that you witnessed; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that was my statement.  That person was taken away with the other persons to be killed.
Q.	And you also refer again to this statement to Shalom, who you described here, "a student called Shalom, who I knew before as the son of Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, who was minister of gender".  Do you remember saying that in your statement? 
A.	(No response)
Q.	And I am jumping through the statements.  I am missing out statements in relevant matters to my case, but just briefly go to statement 9, which is a police statement dated the 5th December 2001, and disclosure code RO9, and this deals with Karenzi again.  

The Prosecution have come back to you and asked you details.  You say: "I personally witnessed his killing during the 22nd and the 30th of April".  Just pausing there, were the dates then much clearer in your memory than they are today?  You had difficulty with dates, didn't you?  But in all these statements, you seem to be quite quick with dates.  Was your memory of dates better then or whatever? 
A.	It was an approximation.  I don't know the exact date. 
Q.	You said here he was killed near the surgical department by a group of doctors.  I remember clearly, you say clearly their names; Gatera, Kageruka, it is misspelt as a "G", it should be "K" as we heard yesterday, and Munyamana.  These doctors were both medical officers.  They killed him using small axes.  And is that something you witnessed? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the evidence [page 28, line 21, to page 30, line 36] has been extracted and filed under seal) 























































































BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, did you give evidence to the judicial police in the case of Twagirayezu?  Yes or no? 
A.	I saw no authorities from the judicial police in my country who asked me questions in the framework of that investigation, no. 
Q.	Were you ever asked questions about Twagirayezu in your country, Dr. Twagirayezu?  Yes or no?
A.	The last time I heard news about Dr. Twagirayezu, I heard that he was in prison.
Q.	Yes or no, please? 
A.	Nobody sought me out at home.  When the authorities need us, they summon us to the court. 
Q.	Did you claim financial compensation for the death of your brother, ***************, the selfsame man that was hit by Gatera?  Did you claim compensation against Dr. Twagirayezu for his death?  Yes, or No?  Or are you aware of any claim on your behalf having been made, yes or no, either one of those questions, please? 
A.	I explained to you that I testified in the Gatera case and that he was the one who killed my brother.  You know how trials go in Rwanda, and you know how it is dealt with in Rwanda as regards financial compensation.
Q.	Did you claim or have claimed on your behalf for your brother, *********death against 
Dr. Twagirayezu?  Yes or no? 
A.	Well, I will try to answer you.  I am not the one suing for damages.  It is the tribunal which is suing.  It is the public prosecutor, who on behalf of the victim, would ask for damages.  He was working at the university that the prosecutor -- it is from the university that the prosecutor asked for compensation.  I am not the one who lodged the complaint. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did you make an allegation that concerned Dr. Twagirayezu being involved in your brother's death?  Yes or no? 
A.	I did not say that he was the one responsible for my brother's death, because my brother died like all the other Tutsi.  All I am saying is that Gatera was present, but I know that he is the one who killed him. 
Q.	Did you claim that Twagirayezu called for someone to remove your brother from the hospital when he was still alive?  Yes or no? 
A.	I gave evidence as regards to events which occurred at the hospital and the evidence was based on the questions put to me.  I was answering questions asked by the staff of the tribunal, the investigators of the tribunal. 
(Pages 24 to 31 by Sithembiso Moyo)








	1200H 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Did you make an allegation that Twagirayezu played a part in your brother's death by removing him from the hospital; yes or no?
A.	You are trying to confuse me.  I admit that I gave evidence against Twagirayezu because I saw him at the site, but I specified that it is Gatera who hit my brother with an axe. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think we can move on to something else.  The witness has adequately answered those questions, questions relating to Dr. Twagirayezu.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	One last question, may I put?  Did you allege that it was Dr. Twagirayezu who, in fact, killed Vianney Koyenzi with an axe, not the three doctors you've named in the other statement?
A.	I testified that he took the drip away from him and had him sent out of the hospital, and that he killed him.  Yes, I gave that evidence.
Q.	********, did you attend an anniversary ceremony in Butare relating to the events in Sehera and Butare?
A.	*********?  I do not remember that anniversary ceremony.
Q.	Do you remember a ceremony that was open by the bourgmestre then, *****for the commune of **********(phonetic) in Butare, and in which you spoke about what had happened during the genocide?  Do you remember that -- do you remember doing that, madam?
A.	You are trying to confuse me.  It was not in ****** but, rather, in 1994.  It was the first -- when there was a celebration of the Hutu victory.
Q.	Did you mean the Tutsi victory?   Sorry, madam, I just want to take you back.  *****, do you remember those television cameras there or a video camera, and someone took an image of it all, and you spoke?  You spoke at great length about terrible things that had happened to you at that place.
A.	It was not a celebration.  It was the burial of the bones of victims.  Perhaps that is what you are talking about.  It was at that -- on that occasion that I took the floor -- that I spoke.
Q.	It was an internment ceremony of the bones of people who had been murdered and you spoke very movingly, perhaps it should be said, at great length about what had happened to you.  You remember that now, don't you?  

Do you remember saying about Sehera and what happened there, that you were there from the very 
-- from the beginning: "I was there from the beginning to the end of the war in Sehera".  Do you remember saying that, right at the beginning of your long oration?
A.	Well, you are talking about a speech which I allegedly made during the internment ceremony, whereas here no reference is made to that event.  Please, can't you move on to something else because this issue has nothing to do with what we are doing here.  Do not bring to mind -- do not bring to my mind these events.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I think you should stop questioning on those lines, especially as they could lead to the witness's identity being revealed.
MR. HOOPER:
I'd like to have a closed session, then, if that's necessary.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We would like to remind you that you have five more minutes.  Is that the last question that you have to ask this witness? 
MR. HOOPER:
More than the last question because I'm really at the beginning of cross-examination; I'm not at the middle and not at the end.  But if you give me five more minutes, then I will attempt to put some questions in that time.  Yes. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	You see, madam, throughout this speech, this moving and terrible account, you make mention of being in Sehera during the time you tell us were at the hospital.  You make no mention of being at the hospital at all, and I suggest you never were at the hospital and that's right, isn't it?  And I'm sorry you are upset.
A.	I told you that I was in hospital.  I have no reason to lie.  I do not personally know Rwamakuba.  He hasn't done anything bad to me.  I have no reason to decide to incriminate him.  So, please stop saying that I'm lying.  Perhaps you have the right to make that assertion, but all I'll request you to do is that do not remind me of the events of the month of April.
Q.	Well, I'm sorry about that.  Did you also give evidence --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, please talk about what was said here, particularly during the examination-in-chief to bring your cross-examination of this witness to an end.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Did you give evidence in the case of Dr. Kageruka in Rwanda, and did you there give a different account again of events that you've described to this Court over the last day or two?  So I can end then with one final attempt of getting to the truth of what -- of what is concerning the Court. 
A.	No, no, wait for me to answer your question first.  I gave evidence in the Kageruka -- evidence before a military court.  I answered the questions which had been put to me.  A witness answers questions depending on what is -- has been asked, you cannot add what you were not asked for.
Q.	I'm sorry, could I just ask you to look at this document?
MS. MAKWAIA:
May I see the document first, please.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Kindly show the document to the Prosecution.
MR. HOOPER:
This is a transcript of this witness's testimony in the Kageruka case which I say is significantly different to the account that she has given before this Court.
THE WITNESS:
If you would allow me I would like to tell you that this document being presented to me is of doubtful origin.  I know that the Kageruka trial took place in a military Tribunal and I wonder whether he has access to the case file of that tribunal.  And that is why I have doubts as to this document, especially as the document to me, is irrelevant.  Therefore, I do not recognise the document.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	That's a very clever answer, and suggest you may know a bit more than you may appear to know because we have had the gravest difficulty getting these documents from the -- from within your country.  You are quite right about that.  We've been obstructed in getting them. But there it is, and if you can have a look at it you might be able to confirm that is indeed what it is. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, please. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Can the witness be shown the document?  And, Your Honours, we still have the same objection we had with respect to the first document.  If counsel wants to introduce it unto the record he should produce the authors of the record for authentication purposes, otherwise, he should mark it for identification.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Do you recognise that document as a document that you signed, Madam Witness?
A.	No, I do not recognise the document.
Q.	Were you present -- and this will take me to my remaining minutes --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness says she does not recognise this document.  We will make the same comment as earlier on.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Did Shalom Ntahobali, who is the man that drove your brother to his death, have you made that allegation? 
A.	I've never said that.  I said that he was put into a vehicle and taken away.
Q.	Did you ever describe the vehicle as a vehicle with a double cabin, and that he was taken by Shalom Ntahobali; yes or no?
A.	I said that it was a red pick-up truck.
Q.	And did you ever hear the witness, Chantal, give her evidence in the Kageruka case, where she said that she had her baby in June; did you hear that?
A.	Yes, I have heard that testimony.
Q.	So when you, in fact, witnessed this incident with Dr. Kageruka, that wasn't June, was it?  And that was Chantal, wasn't it?
A.	I said that Chantal underwent that suffering and that she came to give evidence in the Kageruka trial.  At the time she was explaining what Kageruka had done to her.
Q.	Did you make a false allegation about a man called ******that led to a contempt action in this Court?  Did you say that *******was troubling you, was with you, came to you in Rwanda?
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, that's completely out of the scope of the examination-in-chief.  I have not made one objection with regard to that.  Counsel has been given wide, wide leeway.
MR. HOOPER:
This is nothing to do with the evidence in chief, and everything to do with credibility.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That's indeed correct, we told you earlier that you should concentrate on the examination-in-chief and conclude your cross-examination.  So please do not raise matters which arose outside of the courtroom.  And kindly conclude the examination-in-chief (sic) of the witness, Counsel.
THE WITNESS: 
Madam President, he is raising the ****** problem so that I should be identified.  He is asking me questions which may confuse me so that I would answer in a manner as to reveal my identity.  I do not see any other reasons for such questions.
MR. HOOPER:
That's not my intention.  I have -- madam --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel. 
MR. HOOPER:
I have done my best to compress a lot of matters into the very limited time that I was provided, and I'm making an application for an extension of the time in order to make it -- my time here effective, in my submission, for the ascertainment of the truth.  That's the function that I am seeking to discharge here.
MR. MARTEL:
Madam President, if you would allow me, please.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Martel. 
MR. MARTEL:
I am also entitled to cross-examine the witness, but I waive my right to the cross-examination and I would accede my time to Mr. Hooper.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, please, as concerns the witness, GBV, can the witness be called now, or do you still have problems regarding his health?
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I have not spoken to him directly, but I understand he is in the waiting room.  So whenever we conclude with Witness CEA, and we are ready for the next witness, the Office of the Prosecutor can proceed.  I'll suggest that we simply move ahead, we place him on the stand and then he can answer for himself.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Roach. 
MR. ROACH:
Thank you, Madam President and members of the Court.  

I have no questions for this witness, as such, because this witness does not, in a way, directly relate to my client.  However, because of the nature of the charges, that of conspiracy and joint criminal enterprise over tones, it does concern me very much that we make no errors in this particular portion of the trial, and that is with respect to the cross-examination.  

I had an opportunity to speak with -- with all counsel really, with respect to Mr. Hooper's cross-examination, and we have agreed that we will withhold any questions at all concerning our interests and so and on, accede our time to Mr. Hooper because of the tremendous amount of investigations he has done and information that he has had, which we thought would be helpful to this Court, engaging in credibility in particular.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, we notice that you have been cross-examining this witness for more than four hours now.  However, in view of what your colleagues have just said, we would allow you to continue the cross-examination, but we would ask you once more, that you should limit yourself to the examination-in-chief, matters arising there from, so that we should be able to finish at 1:30 at the very latest because the other witness is waiting.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  Thank you, Madam President.  

Just give me -- can you just give me one moment. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper, you may proceed.
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you, madam.  
Madam President, if I have got another half an hour left to me, my -- I think my choice would be to go to the files that I have been referring to.  My second choice would be to go to the statements that I have touched on, the 11 statements and, then, yes, I'd very much like to deal with matters relating to the events that she maintains that she saw at the hospital.  

I understand what I'm being asked to do, is to abandon the various matters arising from those investigations which you are now aware of obviously, of taking place, the various court hearings and other statements made by her, and to also really let go of the issue of the inconsistencies in the 
11 statements and to clarify her position in respect to some of them.  And that therefore I'm effectively, as I understand it, left to deal with the evidence she gave yesterday in chief.  I think that's -- that's a fair resume of my situation at the moment -- or it's a resume I make, whether it's a fair one or not, but that I'm not to touch those matters relating to credibility; I'm to go to the issue of what she says she saw, the factual issues.  Is that right, Madam President?  I would be assisted.  I don't want to appear to be rather than follow your request.  I mean -- I mean that frankly, I don't want to --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You were in charge of organising your own cross-examination, Counsel, but now we are just asking you to respect the Rules.  The Rules ask that you cross-examine by limiting yourself to matters raised in examination-in-chief.  But for four hours you've been dealing with credibility issues.  As such, we request that you move back to matters limiting yourself only to issues raised during examination-in-chief.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I have spent about an hour on credibility this morning, and the first hour was spent on issues arising from examination-in-chief yesterday.  So to say four hours is misconstruing.  In fact, what -- how this cross-examination is being conducted, in terms of organising my cross-examination, I've been extremely affected by the manner in which I have been constrained, and the Court should be brought to recognise that.  

It seems to me, with respect, that it's almost as if we are addressing these issues across a significant divide, perhaps because we come from such different systems, but I find it difficult, frankly, to understand how it is that this Court cannot see that in a case where allegations of this kind are being made, that the issue of credibility of prior inconsistency is not equally important as, in fact, reviewing the evidence that's given.  It seems to me, with respect, that the function of cross-examination here is not understood.  And I'm sorry to say that, but --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	We perfectly understand the meaning of cross-examination, and it is not up to you to tell us what a cross-examination is.  

Counsel, we have been in several trials.  We have listened to many examinations-in-chief and cross-examinations.  We've given you so much latitude without interrupting you in your cross-examination of this witness.  

The examination-in-chief was one and a half hours long; you've been going on for four hours now.  We believe that you should, as an officer of this Court and a professional, hold yourself back and take into account the judicial economy; this is costing money as well.  Counsel, therefore, make an attempt to re-orient your cross-examination, but please don't say that we are trying to stop you from questioning this witness.  We are even letting you ask this witness questions about issues that don't even concern your client, Counsel.
MR. HOOPER:
Very well, thank you. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, can I return to your position in the hospital as you have described to us.  And you maintain that you were there for one week, and you hadn't eaten, of course, in that time.  Did you ever go out of the hospital other than when you went to go back to Sehera, as you have explained to us today, did you ever leave the hospital on any other occasion?
A.	No, I did not leave the hospital on any other occasion.
Q.	You never left, say, to look for food or anything like that?
A.	No, sir, I couldn't find food.
Q.	I have already asked you, but I will return to it, about André Rwamakuba.  And you say, well, you are unable to describe him at all about his size, his build, or anything like that.  Is that so?
A.	Yes, that is what I told you.
Q.	And did you know -- I mean, did you notice, for example, was he a man who wore glasses or anything like that?
A.	No, I paid no attention to those things.
Q.	Did he have hair?  Was he -- or was he a bald man?
A.	He was not bald, but nor did I really pay attention as to what his face looked like.  I couldn't tell whether or not he had hair.
Q.	Has anyone ever asked you to describe him before today?
A.	No.  I was asked questions to that effect only here, before this Court.
Q.	So, to confirm, you are saying that in all the time that people have been coming to you and talking about him no one's ever said, "Well, can you describe him to us, what he looks like?"; no one ever said that to you?
A.	The person who tried to ask me such questions, I would have answered those questions in the same manner that I answered them for you, Counsel.
Q.	May I ask you this: Has anyone from the Prosecution ever asked you if you've ever given evidence in other countries?  Has that ever been asked of you?
A.	Counsel, do you mean the Prosecutor of this Tribunal --
Q.	Yes.
A.	-- or other prosecutors in other jurisdictions?
Q.	No, this Prosecutor.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Counsel, your response was not heard.  Could you repeat that.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	This Prosecutor.
A.	They didn't ask me questions.  They only asked me if I had ever appeared before the international criminal tribunal.
Q.	Now, you refer to André Rwamakuba giving instructions to the drivers to drop off the people at the commune.  Was that day or night that it happened?
A.	I said that he would show up and give orders to the hospital employees who loaded the Tutsi refugees at the hospital into vehicles to bring them to Nyange to kill them.  This was during the day.  I was an eyewitness of this.
Q.	I may have misheard you but I though you said -- my note reads that Dr. Gatera and Rwamakuba were giving instructions to the drivers to drop off the people at the commune.  The word was -- that the word was "drivers".  It may be that my note is at fault, but just tell us: do you remember if he was talking to the drivers or as you've just said, just to the workers who were about?
A.	I said that Gatera and Rwamakuba gave the hospital employees orders to load those people onto vehicles, those people, and to bring them to Nyange so that they could be killed.
Q.	I'm sorry to dwell on this just for complete safety sake.  It's not your -- it is not your evidence that he gave instructions to drivers, then; is that right?
A.	I said that he gave instructions to the hospital employees.
Q.	Did you ever see Rwamakuba wear a white medical coat?
A.	No, I never made mention of such a thing.
Q.	While you were in the hospital, did you ever meet any of the other ladies who work with you who you know -- who were discussed yesterday, who are also to be witnesses in this case, did you ever meet them during the time you were there in '94?
A.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the evidence [lines 31 and 32] has been extracted and filed under seal)
Q.	I understand that, but you never set eyes on them during your week in the hospital, hiding?
A.	I saw them but I did not know them at that time.
Q.	(By order of the Court, this [portion of the evidence [line 35 to 37] has been extracted and filed under seal)
A.

Q.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the evidence [lines 1 to 3] has been extracted and filed under seal)
A.	When you would look at a person, you could identify their face.  There are others you cannot identify because there were so many of us, and we didn't have enough time, certainly not enough time to chat.
Q.	No, but I am asking about when you went back to the hospital to work later and you saw some of the faces, recognised some of the faces of these people.  Did you discuss with them what had happened?  Did you talk about what had happened during your time in the hospital with them?
A.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the evidence [lines 11 to 13] has been extracted and filed under seal)

Q.	Yeah, well, let me just put simply.  Have you since meeting them again, have you sat down with one or two of them and spoken about what happened there, discussed it with them?  That's all I ask.
A.	It's not really a good conversation, but when it is necessary for me to speak about the atrocities of 1994, we always talk about it.
Q.	And this name that you say you heard at the hospital, this name, Rwamakuba, was that something you remembered back when you were in the hospital in '94?  Is that something that stayed with you in your memory amongst all these terrible things that was happening?
A.	I didn't only remember Rwamakuba, I also remembered the others who were working with him.
Q.	I asked you yesterday, and I'd just ask you one more time; you may have thought about it overnight.  Can you help us as to who it was who took a first statement from you about these matters; when that was and who it was?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel's microphone, please.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Can Counsel Hooper be a bit more specific, in the ICTR or in Rwanda? 
MR. HOOPER:
Anywhere.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can you remember the first time you were asked to make any -- any statement about it, about what happened in the hospital and, particularly, about Rwamakuba?
A.	I told you that we were questioned, questioned by human rights activists.  They didn't give me their contact information.  I don't know their names.
Q.	And finally this: Did you have your ID with you at the hospital?
A.	I did not show my identity card because with "Tutsi" written on it, you would be killed.  So I threw it away.  It was completely worthless at that point.
Q.	Yes, I understand.  How often were you asked to produce it or to show it to people while you were at the hospital?
A.	Each time that they would come to ask for identity cards.  But I didn't have mine, just like many others didn't.  The whole time that I was at the hospital, I was always asked to show my identity card.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, I have no other questions.  Madam Witness, thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
I also thank you, Counsel.  I also thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness. 

Counsel for the Prosecution, do you have any re-examination for this witness? 
MS. MAKWAIA:
I have just one question, Your Honours.  
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Madam Witness, has the testimony you've given the Court been truthful, to the best of your recollection?
A.	Yes.  My statements were well received and trials were -- have been decided on the basis of them.
Q.	And has the test -- the testimony that you've given this Court, yesterday and today, has that been truthful, to the best of your recollection, Witness?
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  The testimony that I gave is truthful; it reflects the truth.  And the each time the Tribunal needs me, know that I'm available to come to testify before the Tribunal, just as I did yesterday and as I am doing right now today.  Thank you. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Thank you, Witness CEA.  

I have an application to make, Your Honours, with regard to names that were uttered by counsel during his cross-examination that, for example, the name of her brother, the name of a certain person who protected this witness at a certain point in 1994, and the area of her current occupation, Your Honours, the Prosecution requests that these identifying names be deleted from the public record.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, all information that may identify this witness shall be stricken from the record, especially information about the name of her father, persons who protected this witness, and also information regarding this witness's profession. 
We had planned to finish at 2 p.m.  Counsel Robinson, will you need much time for the cross-examination of Witness GBV -- GBB.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Robinson, about how much time will you need?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
GBG; intepreter's correction.
MR. ROBINSON:
I think we are all speaking of GBV, and with respect to that witness, I don't think I can give you an accurate gauge of time because of the possibility for interruptions and deliberations by the Trial Chamber, but I will tell you that the Prosecutor took an entire day and one hour with that witness.  And I took approximately one hour with that witness.  So under the rules that you are applying, I think that it would be reasonable to expect that I would be a full day with that witness, but I would certainly not try to extend the time simply to use up an equal amount of time, but I -- that's the best I can say at this point.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We have the following proposals to make: We would like to adjourn now and take up proceedings again at 2:30 with Witness GBV.  At that time, Counsel Robinson may begin his cross-examination of that witness.  We will sit up until 5 p.m., and if by that time we have not finished, we will recommence Monday morning.  We are sorry, we wanted to adjourn at 2 p.m. until Monday, but given the length of the discussions, if we want to respect our calendar obligations, we were obligated to sit this afternoon.  

We are sorry, once again, especially for the interpreters and the court reporters.  We are sorry about the fact that we are going to sit this afternoon.  This is something that was not planned.  

No objection?  We adjourn till 2:30 this afternoon.  

Counsel Martel? 
MR. MARTEL:
Yes, thank you, Madam President.  Yesterday, I made an application concerning the health of my client.  It's partially been applied.  My client has received medicine but still has not received any indications or directions about the use of said medicine.  He doesn't know how often he has to take it; every hour, every two hours et cetera.  Apparently, at noon, some measures were taken to deal with these issues. 
Second thing, would it be possible for my client to eat his lunch in this room and not in the basement of this room, because the basement in this room makes him sick, it gives him allergy attack.  Is that possible?  If he is not allowed this, I'm sure he'll have another attack and we'll be back to the same situation.  Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We'll ask the registry to find out and see what can be done.  

The proceedings stand adjourned.  We resume at 2:30 p.m.
	(Court adjourned at 1304H)
	(Pages 32 to 43 by Gifty C. Harding)





























	(Court resumed at 1440H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are called to order.  Counsel for the Prosecution, is your witness present? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I didn't check on him before entering the courtroom.  But when we left I did speak to WVSS and I asked them to return him to the courtroom for 2:30, so I would imagine that he is in the waiting room.  I'm sure if the registry goes to check in the waiting room, they'll find him there.
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President, before we move on to the next witness, may I just raise one very brief matter.  Madam President --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President, you will recall that there was a folder of documents produced -- not exhibits -- being statements one to ten, to which was added an eleventh, and I'd ask that those be exhibited all together as D. 1, Prosecution statements.  

The second matter is this.  There were three documents produced to Witness CEA, which he did not recognise and which were not in evidence in terms of their contents, and I accept that.  That I would submit that they do need to be exhibited as documents that were produced to the witness that -- documents to which she was referred to her signature, and that these were the documents, or photocopies of documents, which occupied that part of the record of the Court.  

Now, the reason for that is that they need to be exhibited because they need to be, as it were, in the custody of the Court, or copies of them do, because in the future there may be, for example, a handwriting expert or some such who may be coming along to assist the Court further in respect of them, and there would need to be some formal record of those documents, being the particular documents that were produced and, of course, those signatures, being the particular signatures that in fact the witness declined to recognise.  

So for those reasons, I would ask for those two matters to be exhibited:  D. 1, being the statements, which would be referred to rather quickly, but can at a later stage be more closely attended to, and the three documents that, as I say, don't speak of their contents but speak as objects.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, you have the floor. 
MS. MAKWAIA.
	Thank you, Madam President.  I'll start with the first request, to tender onto the record the eleven or ten statements of Witness CEA.  Your Honours, I object to tendering onto the record in a wholesale manner statements given by this witness.  The relevant portions that counsel deemed were inconsistent to her evidence or to other statements were put to the witness, and the witness gave her explanation.  We can't just now throw onto the record all the statements of this witness, Your Honour.  So I make that objection.  We object to all the statements being entered onto the record. 

On the second question, Your Honours, we had already submitted to you earlier today that if counsel wanted to mark for identification the purported proceedings of this witness in Rwanda, he should be allowed to do so until such a time that persons who could authenticate the documents were produced before Your Honours and the necessary foundation was laid before they were produced as part of the record. 

Further to that, Your Honour, when it was put to this witness about these documents, no particular page was put to her attention as to her signature.  But in principle, we are objecting to the entering onto the record of these proceedings, or purported recordings of the proceedings, that this witness attended to in Rwanda.  And we would recommend, if counsel wants them to form part of the record, they be marked for identification only, and not as exhibits in this stage.  Thank you.    
MR. HOOPER:
First of all --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper, could you please be brief. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, certainly.  In respect of the bundle of statements, I'd ask that they all go in, because we would be relying on discrepancies there.  Because of the time constraints, I wasn't able to deal with all the matters with the witness, but they appear on the face of the record and speak for themselves.  And in due course, the Court will be able to give them such weight as it thinks appropriate.  

In respect of the second matter, as I say, effectively, I'm not asking the statements be put in to speak.  They are hearsay.  At least I know that is not necessarily a restraint on the Court.  I am merely asking that they be submitted as objects, that on those objects there were markings which the witness was asked to recognise, and she was led to them, and she didn't do so.  And in future, that will be relevant because the Court will need to know what it was that was put in today.  So in a way, I repeat myself, but those are my submissions.  I hope appropriate ones.  Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecutor.  Do you want to add something?
MS. MAKWAIA.
	Just very briefly, Madam President, thank you.  Counsel knows very well, Your Honours, that if you don't put an issue to a witness so the witness is afforded the opportunity to explain that discrepancy or omission, then he's not allowed to enter the statement onto the record.  If he's done certain references, and as he claims he wasn't given time to do other indications onto the record, then it's our submission that he should not be allowed to enter statements or omissions that he deems omissions or discrepancies of the witness's evidence and her written statements onto the record without affording the witness the opportunity to explain the so-called occasions. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, at the very most, I'd submit it goes to weight, and no more.  We may need to recall the witness in due course, but I hope that's not necessary. 

	Madam President, I'm sorry to take up more time, but I just briefly refer to Rule 89 governing -- which you will be well aware of -- which entitles the Chamber to admit any relevant evidence which it deems to have probative value.  It is strange to have the Prosecution say that they object to their own statements.  They are plainly probative as constituting statements made by the witness, and they are signed by her.  I don't think the Prosecution in any way raise any objection to that.  And they were each and every one referred to in the course of her testimony and so should automatically become exhibited. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we will admit the documents that have been provided and verified by the Prosecutor, namely, documents one to ten, or eleven.  I think eleven, because there is a last statement that was tendered.  But we would assess the probative value of the statements.  We would take mainly into account what was said here in the courtroom.  

As concerns your second request, we have already dismissed it, and we explained -- we explained what you can do for those documents to be admitted into evidence. 

Counsel for the Prosecutor, were you able to find out if Witness GBV is available, is here?
MR. WEBSTER:
The witness is here.  If the representative of the registry would call him, I'm sure that he would enter the courtroom.  

May I have a point of clarification, Your Honour?  I'm not sure if I understood the Trial Chamber in your last statement.  When you said you were admitting Prosecutor's 1 to 11, are you referring to the exhibits that were entered earlier or are you referring to the witness statements that Mr. Hooper handed up to the Court?  I'm not sure clear on that.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If fact, we are referring to the witness statements.  First of all, there were ten statements, and subsequently you gave us another statement, an eleventh statement.
MR. WEBSTER:
You are stating that those statements are being admitted into evidence now? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are saying that we are admitting those documents and that we are going to rule on their probative value. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Could I simply indicate for the record the opposition of the Office of the Prosecutor to admitting these statements into evidence.  First of all, only two of those statements concern the Accused in this case.  I believe there's a statement from 1997 and another statement from 2001 or 19 -- there are only two statements that mention -- that go into -- three, actually, that deal with Mr. Rwamakuba.  All the other statements are basically provided to the Defence for impeachment purposes, and on that basis, I would submit that it is not appropriate for them to be received into evidence.  

All of these statements were given to the Bench.  The Trial Chamber has copies of these statements that were made available to them for purposes of administering this case.  But in terms of evidence that should be considered in any sort of deliberation in this case, we would accept -- or submit that the Trial Chamber should direct itself to the oral testimony of the witness, the statements that the witness made here in this Trial Chamber.  I believe that's the import of Rule 90 concerning testimony of witnesses.  The witness's prior statements are all hearsay.  They are only admissible to the extent that they are contradictions between the prior statement brought to bear or are indicated to the Trial Chamber.  So at least eight of those witness statements are hearsay, not within any exception to the hearsay rule.  

Now, I understand that hearsay is admissible or any evidence is admissible if it has probative value, but I would maintain that those other eight statements do not have probative value for the purposes of determining the guilt or lack of guilt for Mr. Rwamakuba.  They are simply for purposes of impeachment, and it would be inappropriate for them to be received in evidence. 

Furthermore, the witness clarified all of the alleged contradictions between the statements and her oral testimony.  Every question that was put to her by Mr. Hooper she placed in context.  So on that basis, I would oppose admitting any of those statements into evidence.  The Court has copies of the evidence that it can consult during the course of the trial.  But at the conclusion of the trial, when there is a deliberation on the evidence, those statements should not be included.  

But I'm ready to proceed with the next witness, and I would assume that the Court will deliberate and let us know --
MR. HOOPER:
The Court has made a ruling, actually, Mr. Webster. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have made our ruling and we said that we will assess the probative value of the said documents, and that we would take into account what was said here in this courtroom.  We specified that, Prosecutor. 
MR. MARTEL:
Madam President, has the number of the exhibit been stated?  Is it D. 1?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
D. 1.
MR. MARTEL:
Merci. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Witness, Witness GBV.
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Not translated)
THE WITNESS:
I'm fine.  I can answer questions if I'm not made to get tired too much.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  If you have any problem, please bring it to our attention. 

Mr. Robinson, you may proceed with the cross-examination.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President. 
WITNESS GBV
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GBV, I want to direct your attention to the first meeting in Ruhengeri stadium in 1993, where you claim that Mr. Nzirorera was present.  If I recall correctly, you said that this meeting was sometime after the RPF attack in March 1993.  My question to you is, can you tell us approximately how long after that attack did this meeting take place?
A.	I replied that the meeting took place shortly after the attack.
Q.	And you have told us that you knew of two prefects of Ruhengeri, a Mr. Zigiranyiranzo and a 
Mr. Zabaguranyeza (phonetic).  Can you tell us who was the prefect at the meeting in Ruhengeri, at the first meeting you attended in 1993 at the stadium?
A.	I do not remember exactly, but Zigiranyiranzo was certainly not préfet.  He was replaced by Zabaguranyeza, but I'm not quite sure that it was Zabaguranyeza who was head of the préfecture.  What I'm sure is that Zigiranyiranzo was no longer préfet.
Q.	And you have testified that the préfet was present at this meeting, correct?
A.	That is what I said.
Q.	And so can you remember who was the prefect that you saw at this meeting?
A.	I said that the préfet was present, but I did not mention his name.
Q.	So can you please now mention his name?
A.	I saw the préfet.  I explained to you that Zigiranyiranzo was no longer préfet, but I am not sure whether it was Zabaguranyeza who was préfet.  But I remember that a préfet was present, without being able to tell you over the years who exactly was the préfet. 
Q.	At the time of this meeting in 1993, was Mr. Kajelijeli the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune?
A.	He was no longer bourgmestre.
Q.	And what did you understand the position that Mr. Nzirorera held at this time?
A.	He was the secretary-general of the MRND.
Q.	Are you sure about that?
A.	I know that he was secretary-general of the MRND.  If he had not yet become secretary-general during the period of concern to us, I cannot make any commitment in that regard.  But I know that for some time he was secretary-general of the MRND.
Q.	Do you recall how he was introduced at this meeting?
A.	I do not remember all that was said during the meeting.  I told you that I was present, but I do not remember all that was said.  Even if the meeting had taken place only yesterday, I would not be able to tell you all that was said therein. 
Q.	And so I take it from that answer that you do not recall how Mr. Nzirorera was introduced at that meeting. 
A.	Yes, indeed that's correct.
Q.	Can you recall any of the other speakers at that meeting besides Mr. Nzirorera?
A.	As I have already stated, I remember Nzirorera and the préfet, but there were other people whose names I do not remember.
Q.	Did the president of the MRND for Ruhengeri préfecture speak at this meeting?
A.	It is certain that he did.  It was an MRND meeting.  He must have taken the floor, but I cannot tell you who exactly it was. 
Q.	So you have no recollection in your mind's eye to seeing the president of the MRND speak at this meeting, correct?
A.	I'm saying that people made speeches in turn, and there were many speeches.  But I do not remember all those who spoke.  What I said is that I am certain that Nzirorera and the préfet took the floor because they were practically the only persons that I knew.
Q.	Is it a fair summary of your evidence, Witness GBV, that at this meeting among all the people in the stadium, the only people you can identify as being present by name is yourself, Kajelijeli and Nzirorera; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And you were the -- you were the deputy to the responsible of your cellule, correct?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	Now, you spoke of a second meeting that took place in 1993.  Do you recall such a meeting?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	Are you sure that there was a second meeting in 1993 at the préfectural level of the MRND in Ruhengeri?
A.	Yes, I confirm that.
Q.	Then can you tell us why, when you were questioned at the trial of Juvénal Kajelijeli, and you were asked -- and this is on page 94, line 25, "Did you attend any meetings yourself at the préfectural level?"  And you answered, "I attended one meeting at the préfectural level, once when the population were urged to do so, and, as I told you, it is an order."  And you were asked, "Can you tell us when that was?"  And you said, "I do not recall either the month or the date."  

If there were indeed two meetings that you claim to have attended, why did you give this testimony in Mr. Kajelijeli's trial?
A.	You have just read the passages.  You read, but my head is not a computer; I cannot remember or recall all that happened in my life.  Therefore, do not be surprised that I gave you the answer that I did. 
Q.	Well, can you tell us why in November of 1993 or December 2003 you are now recalling a meeting that you didn't recall in July 2001?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecutor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
He can refer to the testimony before the Kajelijeli trial, but if we look at the witness's statement, it clearly states in his statement of -- the first witness statement that he made, that he attended two meetings.  So the question needs to be reformulated.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, that is for re-examination.  I'm entitled to conduct my cross-examination as I see fit.  If there is something inconsistent with the sworn testimony that Mr. Webster wishes to bring to the attention of the Court, he can do that during his re-examination.  But that's not a proper objection. 
MR. WEBSTER:
My objection was to the form of the question.  If you are bringing out inconsistencies in a prior statement, be specific, direct yourself to the trial transcript.  The witness has previously stated in a previous witness statement two meetings.  So be specific in your question.  That's my objection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, can you reformulate your question, please. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GBV, in 1998, when you were interviewed by the ICTR, you told them that there were two meetings at the préfectural level in Ruhengeri that you attended.  In July 2001, when you came to this building to give sworn testimony, you told the Court under oath that there was one.  Now, in December 2003, you have testified again under oath in this Trial Chamber that there were two.  Can you explain to the Trial Chamber why your answers have changed with time?
A.	If I testified that I attended two meetings, and if you are aware of other meetings apart from the two that I attended, well, you are the one saying so.  I do recall -- I'm aware of only two meetings.
Q.	Why was it that you were only aware of one meeting when you testified in 2001?
A.	I told you that I mentioned two meetings.  Perhaps you want to tell me that there were several meetings, or that there was no meeting at all.  What -- if it be your opinion, that is your opinion.  I believe I have given my answer.
Q.	Witness, I'm actually using your words.  In 2001 you said you attended one meeting, and in 2003 you said you attended two meetings.  Those are your words, not mine.  So please can you explain that?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I apologise for the interruption, Your Honour.  Unfortunately, the transcript that I have is missing one page, and I would appreciate it if I could just look at pages 93 and 94 from Mr. Robinson's set of transcripts before we continue with the questioning.  

Unfortunately, in the duplication of my set of transcripts, two pages were not copied, and those are the two pages that we are referring to now.  

So, once again, I apologise for the interruption, but if I can just look at those two pages before we proceed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, of course.  Mr. Robinson.  

Registrar, can you kindly get the document from the Defence counsel to give it to the Prosecutor?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, while he's reading, can I continue with my questions, or do you prefer that I wait? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may continue.  We will come back to the previous matter. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, can you tell us approximately how long after the first meeting that you claim to have attended in 1993 did this second meeting take place?
A.	I don't remember.
Q.	Can you tell us the time of year in 1993 when the second meeting took place?
A.	If I tell you that I do not remember, it means that I neither recall -- I recall neither the month nor the date.  I remember the year, of course, but not the dates (sic) nor the months.
Q.	And how is it that you are able to remember the year without remembering the month?  Maybe this meeting was in 1994; is that possible?
A.	I could give you an example.  When you meet me where I was housed, you could recognise me without remembering my name, even though I must have already told you my name.  This could happen.
Q.	So you are unable to be of any assistance to the Trial Chamber as to when in 1993 the second meeting took place?  Is that fair?
A.	All I am saying is that the two meetings took place in 1993.  I cannot give you more information in that regard, unless you can prompt my memory otherwise. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
In relation to the death of President Habyarimana, did the meeting took place one year after or a few months after that death?  Can you give us some specifics?  Before, rather, before the death, was it one year before or a few months before the death of the president?
THE WITNESS:
It was before the death of the President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I know it was before the death of the president.  But my question is whether you can tell us if it was one year before the death or six months before.  If you can, tell us, but if you cannot, you can also tell us you cannot.
THE WITNESS:
The president died in April 1994, and my testimony is that the said meetings took place in 1993.  But I am unable to give you the month. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, please, can you collect the document from the Prosecutor.  

Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I would simply request that if Defence counsel wants to bring out a contradiction from a previous statement, including a trial transcript, if he would formulate the question as, "Witness, do you recall being asked this question?"  And read the question, and giving this answer, and read the answer, because Mr. Robinson's characterisations tend to deform the witness's previous statements.  So just on a question of form, any inconsistency in a prior statement should be read into the record, please. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President.  I accept that.  I will go ahead and do that right now. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, with respect to your testimony on the 4th of July 2001 in the case of Kajelijeli, were you asked the following question and did you give the following answer.  Question: "Did you attend any meetings yourself at the préfectural level?"  Answer: "I attended one meeting at the préfectural level, once, when the population were urged to do so and, as I told you, it is an order."  Question:  "Can you tell us when that was?"  Answer:  "I do not recall either the month or the date."  

Was that your testimony in Kajelijeli trial on the 4th of July 2001?
A.	If you are reading from a written statement, then I must have said that, but I don't remember saying it.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, at this time I would like to offer into evidence as exhibit DNZ-3, pages 94 and 95 of the transcript, the official transcript of the trial of Prosecutor v. Juvénal Kajelijeli, No. ICTR 98-44A, from the transcript of 4 July 2001.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor.
MR. WEBSTER:
As long as we are admitting into evidence the full contents of both pages, I have no objection, Your Honour.  The questions previous to those posed by Mr. Robinson go into details of when the witness saw Mr. Nzirorera on two prior occasions.  So as long as we are looking at the entire contents of page 94 and 95, the Prosecution has no objection. 
MR. ROBINSON:
And, Madam President, that is exactly what I propose to offer as the exhibit.  The entire document is pages 94 and 95.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Ninety-three and 94 or 94 and 95, Counsel?
MR. ROBINSON:
Ninety-four and 95. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well. 
	Very well, the two pages from the transcripts, this witness's testimony in the Kajelijeli trial, are admitted as Defence Exhibit DNZ-3
	(Exhibit No. DNZ-3 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.  And at some point, it is not necessary right now, I would like to receive a copy of that exhibit, as I just parted with my only copy. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GBV, with respect to this second meeting, was it also held at the Ruhengeri stadium and filled with many people?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And can you give us the name of any person who attended this meeting besides yourself?
A.	I don't remember anyone except for Nzirorera and Kajelijeli.
(Pages 44 to 54 by S Eboe-Osuji)























1530H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GBV, I will put it to you that both Mr. Nzirorera and Mr. Kajelijeli contend that this meeting never took place.  Is there anyone who can verify that this meeting took place, besides yourself?
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting to the form of that question, Your Honour. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I believe I'm entitled to put my case to the witness so that later, when you hear testimony from Mr. Nzirorera and Mr. Kajelijeli, which I believe you will, that this will have been fairly put to the witness. 
MR. WEBSTER:
When Mr. Nzirorera testifies, then he can put on the trial record when he thinks the meeting took place or didn't take place, but it should not -- counsel should not testify on behalf of his client in that respect.  My objection is to the form of your question. 

You should not testify for your client.  You can ask the witness, "Was there a meeting?  Did the meeting take place?"  But you should not say, "Mr. Nzirorera says and Mr. Kajelijeli says there was no meeting.  What do you say?"  That's improper. 

That's the substance of my objection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Objection sustained. 

Counsel, can you please reformulate your question.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Is there anyone who can verify that this meeting took place, besides you? 
A.	Well, since I didn't know that I would be asked who was at such and such a meeting, I didn't pay attention.  I didn't try to find out who would be able to confirm in the future what I was going to say.  But no, I don't remember or I can't recall anyone who can confirm that, Counsel.
Q.	Witness, the stadium in Ruhengeri is a great distance from your home in the Mukingo commune.  Can you remember with whom you set out to attend this meeting?
A.	Yes.  The way you asked the question now puts me in a position where I'm able to talk about someone who was with me.  I remember, for example, that I took the trip with the former chairman of the Interahamwe in my secteur.
Q.	And are we speaking of the second meeting or the first meeting or both? 
A.	It was for one of the meetings, but I can't say whether it was the first or second.  It was for one of them, however.
Q.	And did this man attend the meeting with you? 
A.	Absolutely.
Q.	And are we speaking of the man (By order of the Court this name has been extracted and filed under seal)? 
A.	Listen, why are you mentioning that name?  I wasn't going to bring up that name.  Why are you doing that?  I think it's a bit delicate -- a delicate issue to bring up that name.  You must understand, these are for safety reasons that I don't want to do this.  But yes, that is the person. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I think that the witness is correct.  Let's please strike that name from the record. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, so that it does remain somewhere in the record, may it simply be struck from the public record and maintained in the record of these proceedings?  Or else may the witness be asked to write that name on a piece of paper so we do have some record of it that we can refer to later? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Perhaps we can ask the registry to make some sort of notation on a Court exhibit so that we can identify the person that the witness has just mentioned.  I have no objection to documenting the name somewhere for the Court and for the parties, but it should be stricken from the public record. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Registry, please hand a sheet of paper to the witness. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I will move the admission of this exhibit as DNZ. 4. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Presumably, this will be under seal.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The document on which the witness has written down the name of the person that accompanied him to a meeting is tendered, admitted and marked as DNZ. 4, the next Defence exhibit.  And this exhibit shall be placed under seal. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President. 
 (Exhibit No. DNZ. 4 admitted, under seal)

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GBV, do you know the place known as Gisesero in Mukingo commune?
A.	I know of no such place called Gisesero or Gasesero (phonetic).  Perhaps you mispronounced it.  Can you ask your client to tell you what exactly the word in Kinyarwanda is?  Because I don't know of that place. 
Q.	I'm told the place is pronounced Gisesero and I'll spell it, G-I-S-E-S-E-R-O. 
A.	No.  It's pronounced Gisesero, yes.  I know that place, Counsel.
Q.	And on that place, is there a field where people play football? 
A.	Yes, there is.
Q.	And is the place near the office of the commune but on the other side of the tarmac road? 
A.	Absolutely.
Q.	Now, in 1992 or 1993, did you ever attend any MRND meetings on that -- at that place? 
A.	The MRND meetings in which I participated were just behind the communal office, on a narrower field that is located there.
Q.	Have you ever attended -- well, have you ever heard of an MRND meeting being held at Gisesero? 
A.	I no longer recall.
Q.	And have you ever heard of a meeting of the commune officials with the general population being held at Gisesero?
A.	I told you that I didn't hear about that.
Q.	And did you ever hear of a meeting in Gisesero in which students were taken out of the primary schools, during the school day, and brought to this place, along with the general population, to hear speeches by the bourgmestre and Mr. Nzirorera? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting.  The witness has already answered the questions about Gisesero twice, Your Honour. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I think that's -- I can reformulate my question and make it a little bit more directed at what I'm looking for.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Please do so. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, did you ever hear of any occasion in which students were taken out of their schools to attend an MRND meeting?
A.	I only know about the demonstrations that took place on the roads, but the other things I'm not aware of.
Q.	Now, just on a different topic for a moment, when you testified, did you say that it was your understanding that the people from the Munyemvano compound had fled to Busogo parish and that that was the place where they had been killed?  
A.	Well, some were killed at Munyemvano's.  Others were killed at the parish.  The others had escaped and were running away, and they had arrived at that place.
Q.	And what was your information as to the number of people who were killed at Munyemvano's compound?
A.	I don't know their numbers.
Q.	Now, can you just tell us, if you know, in which secteur is the Rukoro cellule? 
A.	Counsel, can you please repeat that question?  I have not completely understood.
Q.	Do you know in which secteur the Rukoro cellule is located? 
A.	I know that Rukoro cellule is in Busogo secteur.
Q.	Now, did you ever see Mr. Nzirorera distribute weapons? 
A.	No.  I heard people to whom he distributed weapons talk about it, but personally I never saw that.
Q.	Did you ever see Mr. Nzirorera in possession of a weapon? 
A.	No.
Q.	Did you ever see a vehicle of the ministry of public works being used by the Interahamwe?
A.	I remember a truck which was driven by Barageza (phonetic), a tipper truck.  It belonged to the brother-in-law of Habyarimana.  That truck was known.
Q.	Was that a truck of the ministry of public works? 
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And was that used by the Interahamwe?
A.	In which year are you referring to, Counsel? 
Q.	In 1992, 1993 or 1994. 
A.	No.  I did not see Interahamwe in that truck.  It was a truck that brought road -- that transported road materials, but I never saw Interahamwe on board.
Q.	And did you ever see that truck parked in front of the Isimbi pharmacy when Interahamwe were present? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Could we have a bit more precision here, if he could give us the year or the time or put it in context, please? 
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm relating this to the testimony of Witness BGB, and I'm trying to recall, myself, but I'll ask for 1992.
MR. WEBSTER:
That's where I have a problem, though, because this is a cross-examination of GBV; this is not cross-examination of GBG.  Cross-examination is supposed to concern this witness's examination-in-chief.  You've gone beyond this witness's examination-in-chief on a number of points.  I haven't objected, but now you're fishing for information through this witness, and I'm objecting to that.  If you want to ask him about the truck that he described earlier, if he's ever seen that truck before, parked in front of Isimbi house, that's fine, but tell us the month, the year; put it in context.  And if you would please stay within the confines of this witness's testimony. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I will add some dates to my question, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
One moment, Counsel. 

Counsel Robinson, please put questions to the witness which relate to his examination-in-chief.  Please establish a link with his examination-in-chief, because we have gone a bit astray.  We are a bit lost.
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well, Madam President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, you testified that you saw Mr. Nzirorera in Mukingo commune with greater frequency in the year 1993 than you had seen him in 1992 or 1991.  Am I stating your testimony correctly? 
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And is it true that after the RPF attack in February-March, 1993, travel was difficult between Ruhengeri and Kigali? 
A.	I don't know how the roads were.  Because I went there when I went to Kigali, there was no problem as such.
Q.	Didn't the RPF control part of the road between Kigali and Ruhengeri after February of 1993? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting to that question, Your Honour.  First of all, it's way beyond the witness's direct examination.  There is no foundation for it. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Can you rephrase your question, especially since it's a leading question as well? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Madam President, unless I'm mistaken, I'm allowed to ask leading questions on cross-examination, I believe. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I would disagree with that.  He can ask leading questions about the substance of the witness's previous testimony.  When you go into new areas, you have to ask a direct -- a direct question.  You're going into a new area; you're asking the witness about the road between Kigali and Ruhengeri.  The witness didn't testify to anything about that.  You're asking the witness about RPF troops in Kigali and blocking the road.  Nothing was offered in that respect on direct examination.  If you're going into those areas, you should ask a simple, direct question, not a leading question.  And even those questions are impermissible.  They are beyond the scope of the direct examination.  It's improper. 

But on either one of those two grounds -- it being beyond cross-examination or it being improper in form -- I object.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Objection sustained. 

Counsel, please move on. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GBV, is it true that when the MRND was the unique party, the préfet was also the head of MRND in the préfecture? 
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And the bourgmestre was the head of the MRND in the commune, correct? 
A.	That is correct.  It was the same all the way down to the level of the cellule.
Q.	But in the multiparty system, that was no longer true, right? 
A.	It was no longer the case.
Q.	And a person could no longer be bourgmestre and president of the MRND in the commune, correct? 
A.	Correct.
Q.	And can you tell me when the multiparty system came into effect?
A.	I believe it was in 1992.
Q.	And when it came into effect, in fact, new people were selected for the MRND positions, correct? 
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And is it true that throughout Rwanda there were Tutsis who were members of the MRND in the multiparty system? 
A.	Those who were members of the MRND were natives of Ruhengeri and Gisenyi because it was practically a single party in those areas.  But I can't tell you what happened in other areas because I didn't live in those other areas.
Q.	So are you not aware that the MRND had members who were Tutsis?
A.	I am saying that in Ruhengeri and Gisenyi, as I said, whether or not you wanted to be so, you had to be a member of the MRND.  Now, I didn't know what the prevailing situation was in other préfectures.
Q.	I want to ask you some questions about the place you called the Byangabo bar.  Can you tell us who was the owner of this bar?  
A.	The owner of that bar was (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).  He was*********************.
Q.	And it's true, is it not, that he died in 1993? 
A.	Yes.  I believe he died that year, because during the massacres of '94, he was no longer alive.
Q.	Now, do you recall whether or not Mr. Nzirorera was present at his bar for the ceremony regarding his burial, when he -- after he died? 
A.	I was not present during the burial.  We didn't live in the same region, the same area.
Q.	I'm speaking of an event that actually -- a ceremony that actually occurred at the Byangabo bar after his death.  Were you present or did you notice such a ceremony taking place? 
A.	We lived in different secteurs.  I never witnessed that.  I didn't go there.
Q.	In any event, you saw Mr. Nzirorera at the Byangabo bar, correct, at sometime? 
A.	I saw him in the company of Interahamwe on their way from Kigali, and I saw him buying them drinks.
Q.	And it was not only the Interahamwe that Mr. Nzirorera bought drinks for; is that correct? 
A.	It's different when he bought drinks for Interahamwe or for regular members of the population.  Those are different events.  As far as the population goes, I wasn't able to go where they were.  There were important people in the country.  I went during their legislative campaign event, but I couldn't get close to him.  He was an important personality.
Q.	I believe you testified during your direct examination that it was common for Mr. Nzirorera, when he arrived in his home commune of Mukingo, to attract a lot of people to where he was, correct? 
A.	That is correct.  People wanted to receive something from him.
Q.	And he was accustomed to buying drinks for people, whether they were members of the Interahamwe or not, correct? 
A.	Well, there were times where he bought drinks for Interahamwe and times that he met with members of the population, or people in his family, or others who came to see him, to ask him for work.
Q.	And would he buy drinks for members of the population as well? 
A.	Sometimes.  Sometimes the members of his family.  But I don't understand why you're asking me the same question.  I've answered it on several occasions, Counsel.
MR. ROBINSON:
I'll move on.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, perhaps you could move on to another question.  He's already answered this one several times.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Was it customary, when Mr. Nzirorera came back to Mukingo, for people to ask him to solve their social problems, such as if they did not have enough money for school fees? 
A.	All I know is that people came to see him to ask for work.
Q.	Did you ever go to see Mr. Nzirorera when he was in Mukingo commune? 
A.	The question is not at all clear.  Can you repeat it, please? 
Q.	Have you, yourself, ever had a face-to-face conversation with Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	You can ask him that.  He doesn't know me.  We've never had a conversation.
Q.	Now, directing your attention to another building in Mukingo, the Isimbi building, have you ever been inside that building? 
A.	Yes.  I entered there.
Q.	Can you tell the Trial Chamber what was inside that building? 
A.	There were medicines.  It was a pharmacy.  There was a telephone, a public telephone, and we went there whenever we wanted to call people over the phone.
Q.	And is that true for the years 1992, 1993 and 1994? 
A.	From the period that preceded Habyarimana's death, that house was there.
Q.	And were there any other businesses in that house, besides the pharmacy? 
A.	I do not know if some other business was done there.  All I remember is a telephone booth, as well as a pharmacy.
Q.	Do you know whether the office of the MRND for Mukingo was located in this building? 
A.	I don't remember that.  I don't even remember the office -- seeing the office of the MRND in Mukingo commune.  I only know the MRND office in Ruhengeri town.
Q.	Do you know whether there was an office of the Interahamwe in the Isimbi building? 
A.	I have just answered that question.  I said that I do not know if there was some other business carried out in that building.  I told you that there was only a telephone booth, as well as medicine.  In fact, you are wasting time if you ask me other questions in this regard.
Q.	Did you see the Interahamwe gathering at the Isimbi building? 
A.	I saw the Interahamwe at the Byangabo bar in Nzirorera's house when he came to the commune or when there was a meeting.  As I told you, I was not often at that place because I lived a little bit far away from that area.  Of course, I had to take care of other matters at my house.
Q.	Do you recall ever seeing the Interahamwe gathered near the Isimbi building? 
A.	If I stop answering your questions, do not be surprised, because I have answered that question. 
Q.	So the answer is no? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, can you move on to another question?  It is true that he has answered that question. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm not sure I know the answer, but I will leave the record as it is. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Can you tell us if you ever saw any military training by the Interahamwe in the Byangabo centre area? 
A.	I talked of the place where the Interahamwe underwent military training.  I mentioned two places in Mukingo commune.  I was not able to specify the places because the Interahamwe did not want to show the places to the people, and the said Interahamwe did their training in the Gishwati forest, but I do not know other places where the Interahamwe underwent military training. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you please spell the name of the forest that you just mentioned? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Gishwati.  Gishwati is spelt as follows:  G-I-S-H-W-A-T-I, Gishwati.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may continue, Counsel.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Did you ever see any military training of the Interahamwe on the premises of the commune office of Mukingo?
A.	I said that the Interahamwe did their training in two places, which I cannot specify.  They also did more training at Gishwati forest.  That was my answer to the question.
Q.	Did you ever see them training in any public place in Mukingo where they could be observed by the public? 
A.	I know that the Interahamwe did military training, and I heard people say -- for example, people in Uganda said that they did training, that they were training.  But I am not able to show you or tell you where they trained.  I heard people say that the Interahamwe were undergoing military training, but I do not know where they underwent the military training.
Q.	To your knowledge, was there any military training taking place within the commune of Mukingo? 
A.	Are you talking about military training given to the national army, or are you talking about something else? 
Q.	I'm talking about training in the use of weapons, for example.  Did any such training take place within Mukingo commune, to your knowledge? 
A.	It is the same training that I talked about earlier on.  The Interahamwe were taught to use guns, to shoot guns, and they were given military training.
Q.	And was any of that military training within the commune of Mukingo? 
A.	Yes.  The training took place in Mukingo commune.  I have told you that on several occasions.
Q.	And can you tell us where within the commune of Mukingo this training took place, and how you know? 
A.	I have given you an example of Uganda.  One could hear over the radio that those who were opposed to the regime were being given military training, but nobody could specify where.  I told you that I heard it said that such training was being given in Mukingo, but I cannot be specific as to where the training was given.  I did not have access to the training.  I could not see the training going on. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, may the witness be shown an exhibit which I'm going to mark -- ask be marked as Exhibit DNZ No. 5? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution.
MR. WEBSTER:
(Previous translation continued) ... Interahamwe? 
MR. ROBINSON:
I think the Interahamwe is probably best described by the witness, so I'll put some questions to the witness. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, do you see that exhibit that's been placed in front of you by the registrar? 
A.	Yes.  I see it. 
Q.	Is that the clothing that you have described as having been worn by the Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON:
At this time, Madam President, I would move for the admission of Exhibit DNZ. 5.  But I would ask that it be left with the witness because I'm going to ask him some questions about it. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, any objection? 
MR. WEBSTER:
With the qualification that -- I'm sorry, I didn't hear everything that Mr. Robinson -- excuse me, it's hard to hear and speak at the same time with the earphones.  I missed a bit of what Mr. Robinson said.  It's being introduced for what purpose, please? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, that is being introduced to show what the Interahamwe uniform looked like, according to this witness, similarly as the Prosecution's video clip was introduced for the same purpose. 
MR. WEBSTER:
If we are asking the witness to identify the fabric and he identifies it as the MRND fabric that was used to make Interahamwe uniforms, no problem.  The witness will identify it, and you can proceed on that basis.  If that's the proviso, there is no objection. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I think the witness has already done that, but would you like me to ask some further questions on that point? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GBV, the fabric, the clothing that you have in front of you, is that the same fabric that you described as the uniform of the Interahamwe?
A.	It seems to me that it is the same type of fabric used by the Interahamwe.  In fact, the Interahamwe clothing is similar to what I have before me, unless you brought some fabric which is slightly different. 
MR. ROBINSON:
So Madam President, I will again ask that Exhibit DNZ. 5 be admitted. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The Trial Chamber admits, as a Defence Exhibit, fabric which we mark as DNZ. 5, of some attire sewn out of some fabric, and that exhibit is marked as DNZ. 5. 
 (Exhibit No. DNZ. 5 admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And Witness GBV, is this fabric what you've described as kitenge?
A.	Yes.  It is kitenge, but in general, it was fabric that was used for sewing the MRND uniform.
Q.	And in fact, you see the letters "MRND" on the fabric itself? 
A.	That's correct.
Q.	And what else is written on the fabric? 
A.	I can see "7th Congress."  I do not know what else.  I can also see the figure 7.  I can see letters E and C.  I do not know what this represents.  Maybe "congress" or something like that.
Q.	And do you also see on the fabric words denoting the 15th anniversary of the MRND and the year 1990? 
A.	Even if those inscriptions appear on the fabric, I cannot accept that, because since 1975 -- perhaps it would be necessary for me to be more precise in my calculation.  I do not know whether the MRND had existed for 15 years since its inception.  In any case, this has to be verified.  Yes.  I think it was, indeed, 15 years.
Q.	And on the fabric itself that is before you, you see the inscription,  "15th anniversary, MRND, 1990," correct?
A.	Yes.  I can see the inscription.  I do not know if the fabric was manufactured for the purpose of the anniversary, but that was the fabric that was used to sew the MRND uniform.
Q.	And from 1975 to 1990, that was the period when the MRND was the unique party, correct? 
A.	That's correct.
Q.	Now, this -- this clothing, or this fabric, could be worn by anyone in the population, correct?  
A.	I did not see anyone else wear it except the Interahamwe. 
Q.	And was this the fabric that the Interahamwe was wearing in Byangabo centre on the 7th of April 1994? 
A.	Yes, that's correct.
Q.	And directing your attention to the 7th of April 1994, you told us you arrived at the Byangabo centre early that morning, correct? 
A.	That's correct.
Q.	And you were already present in Byangabo centre when you observed a vehicle driven by Mr. Kajelijeli arrive there, correct? 
A.	That's correct.
Q.	And can you again tell us the time, approximately, you believe that Mr. Kajelijeli arrived in Byangabo centre on the morning of the 7th of April 1994? 
A.	He arrived there in the morning.  I do not remember the exact time.
Q.	Do you recall, in your statement of July 1998, that you said that this was about eight o'clock in the morning? 
A.	It's a long time when I gave that testimony.  It is impossible for me to remember all the details.  From 1994 to date, about ten years have elapsed.  From 1998 to date, other years have elapsed.  So it is impossible for me to remember all the details that I gave, unless you read them out to me, in which case I could confirm that I said so or I didn't say so.
Q.	Do you recall when you left your house on the morning of 7 April 1994, was it light or dark? 
A.	I got up very early in the morning, but it was already daylight. 
Q.	When you saw Kajelijeli arrive in his vehicle at the Byangabo centre, was the vehicle coming from the direction of Nkuli or the direction of Ruhengeri town? 
A.	If you remember what I told the Prosecutor yesterday, I testified that I was in a crowd, and I did not see the direction from which the vehicle arrived. 
Q.	Did you see Mr. Nzirorera any time on the 7th of April 1994? 
A.	Please kindly repeat the question.  I did not quite understand what you said.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, if you need a break, you may say so.  Do you have water?  Do you have water -- you have water before you.  You could drink.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have water before me.  But the water will only refresh my throat, but it would not take away the fatigue. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you still need -- do you still need more time, a lot of time? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, it is envisaged that we will hear you up to 5 p.m.  In other words, we should finish with you for this afternoon by 5 p.m.  Do you think you can bear with us again for another 30 minutes? 
(Pages 55 to 66 by Mark Porter)





	1630H
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  If we do not go beyond the 30 minutes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Mr. Robinson, you may continue up to 5 p.m. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, am I to understand that I will be able to continue my cross-examination on Monday?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we ask you to proceed, but please try to be precise and concise so that we do not keep this witness here for too long, because he is ill.
MR. ROBINSON:
I understand that, and I think I've been doing pretty well today, but I just want to know if I have to rush through and fit everything in 30 minutes, or can I take my time and continue?  Because I don't think I can finish in 30 minutes at all with the material I have, and Mr. Roach also is going to be questioning this witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are aware of that, Counsel.  You have 30 minutes, but you may continue on Monday, and 
	Mr. Roach may also ask his questions.  But what we are asking of you now is to do your utmost so that we do not keep this witness for too long on Monday, because he's not well. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President; I understand. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	I think the question that I'd asked you, Witness GVB, is whether you had seen Mr. Nzirorera on the 7th of April 1994, at any time. 
A.	I didn't see him.
Q.	Did you see him at any time in April of 1994?
A.	I explained that, during that month characterised by massacres, I couldn't show myself.  I'm the only one who knows where I was; nobody else knows. 
Q.	Now directing your attention to the 7th of April, while you were in the Byangabo centre, did you see Colonel Setako there?
A.	On that date, the people that I saw, I've already mentioned them.  You observed what I said, and you realize that I did not mention Setako.  I did not see him on that date of 7th April.
Q.	And did you see Colonel Augustin Bizimungu on 7 April in Byangabo centre?
A.	No, I didn't see him.  Perhaps he arrived after my departure, but I can only say what I saw.
Q.	Did you see Casimir Bizimungu anywhere in the Byangabo area on 7 April?
A.	Nor did I see him, no.
Q.	And did you see any military personal near Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house on the morning of 7 April?
A.	Since Nzirorera's mother lived behind the Byangabo stores, and since I was in a position only to see what was going on at the Byangabo centre, I was not able to see what was happening at his mother's house, so I don't know whether or not there were soldiers there in that area. 
Q.	Did you see any soldiers either coming or going to that area?
A.	No, I did not.
Q.	You testified that on the morning of the 7th of April, in Byangabo centre, you observed a man named Rukara being killed; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I stated that.
Q.	And can you tell us how far away from this incident, the place where Rukara was killed, you were?
A.	There was about 30 metres between the place where I was and the place where he was put to death.
Q.	And could you see it clearly from your distance?
A.	Yes, I saw everything.
Q.	And can you tell us, where was Mr. Kajelijeli at the time Rukara was killed?
A.	Kajelijeli was at home, at his house.  Rukara lived close to Kajelijeli's place.  There was only two houses between their two houses.  Rukara was chased down and killed in a puddle of water in front of another pharmacy, Isimbi pharmacy, and Kajelijeli was behind the attackers.
Q.	So he was outside of his house; is that correct?
A.	Which house?  That of Rukara? 
Q.	I'm sorry, that's my fault because my question was too vague.  At the time Rukara was killed, Kajelijeli was not inside his house, correct?
A.	No, they stayed outside.  You could see them outside.  There was a gathering outside, and I could see how Rukara was running and he was being chased down by the assailants.  And I saw how they killed him.
Q.	And it's your testimony that Mr. Kajelijeli was present at that time when Rukara was killed, yes?
A.	Yes, he was present.
Q.	Are you sure about that?
A.	I confirm that.  He was only killed after Kajelijeli's arrival. 
Q.	And was he killed by this man you have named as Michel Niyagaba?
A.	He was the one who was holding the machete in his hand, but he wasn't alone.  Many other people were around and lots of them were hitting him, but he was the one who had the weapon in his hand. 
Q.	Now, did you see the councillor of Busogo secteur, Assiel Ndisetse, on the scene as well?
A.	No, I didn't see him there.
Q.	Did you see anyone try to intervene to stop the killing of Rukara?
A.	As I watched that scene, I made myself scarce.
Q.	And while you were watching the scene, did you see anyone try to stop the killing of Rukara?
A.	I saw nothing of that sort. 
Q.	Witness GVB, you are currently in the same place here in Arusha with another witness with the pseudonym GBE; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Have you discussed with him the events of the morning of the 7th of April 1994 at Byangabo centre?
A.	No, we didn't discuss that subject.  He's made his own statements.  I'm making my own.  We were prepared differently, and you will find that our testimonies are different, and that will prove to you that we did not discuss this subject.
Q.	And how is it that you know your testimonies are different on this point?
A.	I am saying that because I'm relating what I was able to observe.  If he says what he was able to see, it's possible maybe for our testimony to be corroborating.  That would be a good thing.  But if our testimony isn't similar, it won't be a big deal because each one of us saw what we saw.  I cannot ask him questions because I want to avoid being influenced by what he says.  Each one of us has to keep in mind what we observed ourselves, what we saw ourselves, and testify on the basis of that only -- only that personal experience.
Q.	Witness GVB, let me ask you to comment on the testimony of Witness GBE given on the 9th of July, 2001, at page 78, line 14.  I'm going to read it to you:  "And at the meantime, still that same morning, I saw Michel, the person that I had referred to -- "
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Is Counsel about to ask this witness to characterise the statement of another witness?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Robinson, do you have a response? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President, I am going to confront him with the inconsistent testimony of another witness and give him the opportunity to explain his testimony in light of that information, and I will elicit that testimony from the other witness.  But first I wish to give him the opportunity to explain any discrepancies.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution.
MR. WEBSTER:
First of all, the question is improper, and even if we can proceed on that basis, GBE has not testified in this Court yet.  I don't understand this mode of questioning, but it's objectionable.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Objection sustained.  

Counsel, can you move on to another issue?
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I would like to have placed before the witness a copy of his own witness statement, dated the 30th and 31st of July 1998.  I think I will ask the French version of this statement to be placed before him, and that is registry number 2223 bis, and the first page of the statement has the 
K-number K0140901. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, I have placed before you what I represent to be your statement of 30 July 1998 and 31 July 1998, and I would ask you to take a look at that statement and tell us whether it is, in fact, the statement that you gave to the ICTR on those days. 
A.	Well, I can see that details concerning my identity are on the first page, but I don't see a signature, but I must say that it is -- yes, it is indeed my statement.
Q.	And is there not a signature on the bottom left-hand corner of the first page?
A.	No, I don't see one.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I'm not quite sure what we're doing here.  If the witness has made a statement that counsel wants to bring out as inconsistent, then the specific statement should be put to him, but to put his entire witness statement before him and ask him to identify it, I don't quite understand what we're trying to accomplish.  

Furthermore, I don't think this witness has testified that he understands and reads French or English, so even in terms of identifying the statement, he's referring to the identifying information on the first page.  And if Mr. Robinson clarifies exactly what he's trying to accomplish, I'd appreciate it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Robinson, the witness said that he did not see his signature on the first page, and in the French version, there is no signature.  I don't know if you have a signature on the document you have before you.  Counsel, can you tell us which page you want to examine? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  Actually, Madam President, I believe that the signature is on the English version, so I would like to have the English version shown to the witness so that we can establish, first of all, that this is his statement, and then I will move on to a specific paragraph in the statement that I wish to examine him on with respect to the death of Rukara. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, do you see your signature on the statement that is now before you? 
A.	Yes, and I can even see my signature.
Q.	And so can you confirm that that is, in fact, the statement that you made to the ICTR when they interviewed you in July 1998?
A.	Yes, I recognise this statement.
Q.	Are you able to read French so that you can read a particular paragraph to yourself if I direct you to that paragraph? 
A.	No, I don't know French.  Even if I was able to read it, I would have great difficulty understanding it. 
Q.	Then I will read to you the contents of your statement with respect to the events at Byangabo on 7 April 1994.  But before I do, let me ask you, do you know whether or not, when you were interviewed by the ICTR in 1998, you told them that you had witnessed the death of Rukara?
A.	I don't remember.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, given the fact that you have these statements, I don't know whether you -- I propose to read a paragraph on the top of page 5 of the French version, the first full paragraph, but if the Trial Chamber wishes me to simply refer the Trial Chamber to that paragraph and not read it, I can do that as well. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Excuse me, are you referring to page 5 of the English or the French, Mr. Robinson? 
MR. ROBINSON:
I was referring to the French.  Actually, excuse me, it's page 6 of the French, page 5 of the English, I'm sorry.  It's the first full paragraph on page 6 of the French and the very top paragraph on page 5 for the English.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
First paragraph you wish to read on page 6 in the French version? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm going to read from your statement, Witness GBV, and I'm going to ask you whether or not you mentioned the death of Rukara when you spoke to the ICTR.  What your statement says is, Specifically as to Kajelijeli, Juvenal, I can remember seeing him on 7 April 1994 at the marketplace at Byangabo business centre, mentioned above, in the company of Baheza, Estras.  This was about eight o'clock in the morning.  At that time I saw a large number of other men with Kajelijeli and Baheza.  I was close enough to hear Kajelijeli say to the men, 'Habyarimana has been killed.  Go home and put on your uniform.  We have work to do.'  This is what he said, to my memory.  I was about 30 metres away and I heard it.  The men apparently lived close by because they returned within about 15 minutes, and I saw that they were now dressed in the Interahamwe uniform I have already described.  I am sure it was the same group of men to whom the order had been given by Kajelijeli.  I should add that Kajelijeli and Baheza were not themselves in the Interahamwe uniform.  

"Additionally, by the time the first group of men had returned in their uniforms, a larger number of people had gathered at the marketplace.  Some of these were also dressed in the Interahamwe uniform.  I also saw various weapons being carried; weapons were carried not just by those in uniform but by others as well.  The weapons I saw included spears, pangas, machetes, clubs with nails on top, hand grenades, and rifles, types FAL, L-4 and Lee-Enfield.  Both Kajelijeli and Baheza were carrying L-4s.  I also saw three vehicles, two of which I would describe as camionnettes, one a Toyota Stout and another, a Toyota Hilux.  The other vehicle was a Mazda sedan.  The Mazda sedan, I recognised as the vehicle which used to be owned by that that (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), the brother of Nzirorera, whom I mentioned above.  He was the one who used to be the chief of the CDR."
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, do you intend to continue to read the entire document?  He won't remember, after you read all of this, what was said, it's so long. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I just want to ask him, now that I've read this portion about the events occurring on the morning of the 7th, whether it's true that he never mentioned witnessing the death of Rukara when he was interviewed by the ICTR. 
THE WITNESS:
In the Kajelijeli trial, that question was put to me, but Kajelijeli killed many people.  Some of them were not mentioned in this statement.  It's impossible to give you an exhaustive list of Kajelijeli's victims.  I forgot to mention Rukara, but there are many others.  He killed many other people.  The mention of Rukara during the interviews with investigators, or not mentioning that name, doesn't exclude him from having been the author of that crime -- or the perpetrator of that crime, rather.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, it's five o'clock.  Perhaps we will adjourn now and we will recommence as planned, Monday morning.  Thanks to everyone.  

Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution, you have a remark?
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I believe it was yesterday Mr. Robinson made an objection based on testimony that came from the witness under my -- when I was conducting a direct examination.  It had to do with events in 1991, and he had also made an oral application for certification.  He mentioned three cases -- he mentioned a ruling in the Bagosora case.  I've looked at that decision.  

I've also found two subsequent decisions in the Bagosora case that are on point to the issue that he raised that I'd like to argue before the Court, if the Court is still deliberating on his application for certification.  It does not have to be done now, but I just wanted to bring it to the Court's attention and to let the Defence know that I'd like an opportunity to raise that issue again before the Trial Chamber, if the Trial Chamber thinks it would be helpful to have further discussion on that point.  Because there is case law subsequent to the decision cited by Mr. Robinson, and even with respect to the decision that he cited, I don't think it stands for the propositions that he mentioned when he first raised the issue yesterday.  

And then before we close this session, forgive me if I return to a question that we've already dealt with, but I'm concerned still with the 10 or 11 statements that were entered into the record for Witness RO, and I'm requesting that the Trial Chamber put those under seal if it's receiving them in evidence.  

If we mark them as a Defence exhibit, they enter the public record, and I'm asking the Court to simply place them under seal if it's going to admit them in evidence.  Thank you.  Because they do contain a lot of identifying information, and details of the crimes that may be embarrassing to the victim.  Thank you. 
MR. O'SHEA:
No objection on that, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  DNZ 1 -- D. 1, rather.
MR. O'SHEA:
DR. 1.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
DR. 1 is placed under seal.  DR. 1, that is Defence Exhibit for Rwamakuba 1, placed under seal. 
(Exhibit No. DR. 1 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, do you want to say something? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  Madam President.  May I trouble you for one moment just to ask who will be the next witness that we should be prepared for on Monday after GVB?  And secondly, I would like to ask the Trial Chamber for the Trial Chamber's assistance to my client, and perhaps the other detainees, with one matter, and that is that they are only allowed to call their families during the week during the regular business hours, from the UNDF, that being Monday through Friday, apparently, 9:00 to 5:00 or something like that, and so as a result they have not been able to call their families because of the schedule of the trial.  And I would ask that the Trial Chamber could assist in having UNDF allow them to make such a call over the weekend, in light of the hours that we've been sitting.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Have you -- you have not filed any application with the registry.  I believe this can be resolved.  This could be resolved with the registry. 
Counsel for the Prosecution, can you tell us who the next witness is after GVB? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, Your Honour.  After GVB, we will hear testimony from Witness RJ.  After RJ, we will hear testimony from GIO.  And after GIO, we will hear testimony from HF, I believe it is.  It's the same order of witnesses that we had established beforehand.  And then we will make a later determination whether we will hear testimony from GBE.  If we do, he will be the last witness for this Court session.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution, for that information.  

Yes, Mr. Roach. 
MR. ROACH:
Yes, Madam President and members of the Court.  I've had an opportunity to consult with members of the Defence over here, as well as the Prosecutor, and we have determined that it would be best for us if we can meet with Mr. O'Donnell at 11:30 on Friday next.  And I wanted to see if we could clear that time with the Court.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The Trial Chamber is of the view that that is agreeable, Friday, 11:30 a.m., a meeting between the parties and Mr. O'Donnell.  So we will not sit on Friday morning.  Very well. 

Witness, we thank you for the effort you have made.  Monday morning, you will appear here for the continuation of the cross-examination.  Try to rest, and we hope that you will be well on Monday for the rest of the cross-examination. 

Mr. Martel. 
MR. MARTEL:
You said we will not be sitting on Friday morning, but I believe we would not be sitting on Friday afternoon either.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We think that we should have finished by Thursday, so in fact we will not sit at all on Friday. 
MR. MARTEL:
Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Have a nice weekend, and see you on Monday.  Thank you.  The proceedings stand adjourned. (Court adjourned at 1710H)
