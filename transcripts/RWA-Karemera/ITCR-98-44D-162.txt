MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, you understand the significance of going into open session.  It means that the -- this aspect of your testimony, the public will have access to it.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness indicates assent.  
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we are in open session.  If you think that your answer to any question will reveal your identity to the public, please inform the Trial Chamber before you respond, and try to be responsive.  Do you understand? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness indicates assent.  
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know Mr. Nzirorera's occupation during 1993 and 1994? 
A.	He lived in Kigali.  As to his occupation, I don't know.  But I know that he lived in Kigali.  
Q.	Was Nzirorera a member of a political party? 
A.	Yes.  He was a member of the MRND. 
Q.	Do you recall what Mr. Nzirorera's status with the MRND party was in 1993 and the beginning of 1994? 
A.	I heard that he was a top leader in Kigali in the MRND.  As to his status, well, I couldn't put such a question to him.  
Q.	Can you tell us whether Joseph Nzirorera had a particular status in Ruhengeri during the period 1993 and the beginning of 1994? 
A.	Yes, he was a top leader.  He was the one who directed or governed all the MRND members in Ruhengeri.
Q.	You say he was one of the top leaders in Ruhengeri.  Who were the other top leaders in Ruhengeri? 
A.	In the MRND there was a former préfet, Zigiranyirazo.  There was also Basile Nzanana, Kajelijeli, Baheza.  The others that I knew belonged to the CDR party.  
MS. VISSER:
For the record, Kajelijeli is number 38 on the list, and Baheza is number 4 on the list.  
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, was Nzirorera influential in your community in Mukingo? 
A.	He was considered like a king.  Just as Queen Elizabeth is highly considered in her country, he was considered a king in Byangabo. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you've mentioned some other top leaders in Ruhengeri.  Who was the leader of those top leaders? 
A.	Zigiranyirazo. 
Q.	Did Nzirorera meet with the other leaders that you've mentioned, as far as you recall? 
A.	He would summon them and go to his house -- his mother's house, and that's where he would meet them. 
Q.	How do you know that? 
A.	At one point he called them, and he was at his mother's house.  And he also called us at one point.  He asked us to go and tear down the MDR and PL flags, and he was having a drink with those people at his mother's residence.  And we obeyed.  We went and fetched for him, and brought back to him, the flags of those two parties.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, I will come back to this incident later on.  Now I want to ask you some more.  

I asked you how do you know; you explained now one occasion.  Can you explain how you knew about the other occasions.  
A.	On other occasions I would see him go into his mother's house when I was at Byangabo.  And once the meeting was over, those people would go home.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, now I want to direct your attention to the rally in Ruhengeri in which the president, Habyarimana, gave his speech.  You've mentioned that before.  Do you recall this rally? 
A.	I remember. 
Q.	Do you remember when this rally took place? 
A.	I remember the year.  It was in 1992, towards the end of 1992. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you participate in that rally? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What was your role? 
A.	I was a mere Interahamwe.  I had no particular role in that meeting -- in that rally. 
Q.	Do you recall who made speeches? 
A.	I remember Habyarimana spoke, but someone else, another man, spoke, but I can't remember his name. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know what the general thrust was of those speeches? 
A.	Habyarimana said that when he would come down he'd be accompanied by his Interahamwe.  He said that the Inkotanyi had taken positions among the volcanos and were preparing to attack.  He was in Ruhengeri.  And when he said he would come down with Interahamwe, he meant that he would go to Kigali.  And arriving, he said he didn't want to pass without saying hello but added that if anything happened he'd go down with his Interahamwe.  
Q.	Can you try to explain what it is he went down -- or, he would go down with the Interahamwe?  Can you try to explain that to the Court? 
A.	To my mind, it meant to kill the Tutsi because the Tutsi had attacked.  A few days before, some Tutsi were arrested and were called accomplices.  Some of those people had been killed.  Some of them had been imprisoned, and members of the community were also killed.  
Q.	What was your conception of this speech given by Habyarimana?  What did you think about it? 
A.	As far as I'm concerned, it was bang in line of what we were doing.  We'd been looking for the Tutsi for several days and killing them, and I understand it as being smack-dab in the middle of the line we were heading along.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you mentioned that you participated as an Interahamwe.  Who were the other participants of this rally? 
A.	There were also members of the CDR present at that rally.  
Q.	Was Mr. Nzirorera there? 
A.	He was not there. 
Q.	Can you give us an estimation of the amount of people that were there at the rally? 
A.	There were numerous people taking part.  Interahamwe had also come from Kigali with a view to taking part in the rally, at least five busloads.  There were also CDR members from Ruhengeri.  There were Interahamwe members from Ruhengeri.  Everybody came to take part in that rally.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Before you've confirmed that you were an Interahamwe, and I would like to ask you now some questions about the Interahamwe in general and about the training you received as a member of the Interahamwe.  

Before I proceed to cover your personal experience, I want to ask you some general questions.  What are the Interahamwe? 
A.	I am not in a position to explain to you the meaning of the word, but I know that there are some people who are in a position to do so.  In brief, there are people who work together, and that is the meaning of that word, i.e., people have come together with a view to working together. 
Q.	Did they belong to any political party? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Which party? 
A.	The MRND. 
Q.	What is the connection between the MRND and the Interahamwe, according to your knowledge? 
A.	It is more or less the same thing, the MRND and the Interahamwe.  You're talking about the link between the two.  Well, I would say that it is one and the same thing.  It's practically the same entity.  
Q.	So everybody who was an MRND member was an Interahamwe member as well? 
A.	Some people had been selected to become Interahamwe.  The members of the MRND could provide members of the Interahamwe with information as to where to find people.  To my mind, there is no distinction between MRND and Interahamwe.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, what was the Interahamwe movement created for, as far as you can remember? 
A.	Are you asking me why the Interahamwe was set up?  Well, it was with a view to killing the Tutsis. 
Q.	In your view, what was the ethnic composition of the Interahamwe? 
A.	They were Hutus. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, now I want to direct your attention to the Interahamwe in your region in Mukingo.  When was the Interahamwe created in Mukingo? 
A.	I believe that the movement was set up before Habyarimana went to Ruhengeri. 
Q.	Do you recall who was responsible -- or, who were responsible for the creation of the Interahamwe in your area? 
A.	In fact, we were a youth movement.  Kajelijeli asked us to come and asked us who our leaders were.  He then asked us to elect our leaders.  I believe that that was at the beginning of 1992, in the first few months of 1992. 

As regards the leader who set up the Interahamwe, it was Nzirorera who promised us uniforms, kitenge, when he found us in a place where we were being trained in weapons handling. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I will come to that last point that you mentioned later on.  I now want to go on about the creation of the Interahamwe in your area.  

You mentioned that Kajelijeli asked you, the Interahamwe, to come with leaders.  Were you there?  Did you hear that yourself? 
A.	Yes, I was there.  He asked us to elect leaders to our group, and that is what we did.  And we then gave the names of our leaders.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you give me the names of the leaders? 
A.	The first was Dusabimana and then Niyigaba, Michel.  The third was Noel; Habyarimana, Bagabo; the fifth was Alexis Rukundo. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you mentioned a Dusabimana.  Is that the name as Dusabimana? 
A.	It was, indeed, Dusabimana.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Number 16 on the spelling list.
BY MS. VISSER:  
Q.	Did you call that person sometimes by another name? 
A.	At a given moment in time, I referred to him as a sergeant, Dusabe, Sergeant Dusabe. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You mentioned these were the leaders of the Interahamwe in your region.  Did they have a special task in their leadership? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you explain to the Court who was doing what? 
A.	Niyigaba, Michel -- Michel Niyigaba was the president of the Interahamwe.  
MS. VISSER:
That is number 61 on the spelling list. 
THE WITNESS:
The vice-president was Dusabimana, but, in practice, it was Dusabimana who behaved like -- like the president of the Interahamwe.  As regards the secretary, it was Ndayisaba, Noel; Noel Ndayisaba. 

MS. VISSER:
For the record -- for the record, that is number 59 on the spelling list.  
THE WITNESS:
The treasurer was Habyarimana.  Alexis Rukundo came to replace Dusabimana in view of the fact that Dusabimana was not often available.  So he then came to occupy the post of vice-president.
BY MS. VISSER:  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  

Is it correct that you received your orders and instructions from these leaders?  
A.	Yes, those leaders were the ones to give us instructions. 
Q.	Do you know from whom they got their instructions? 
A.	I cannot tell you, but the fact of the matter is that he would give us instructions.  And when we asked them whence they came, he said it was the leaders, that is, their leaders, who had given them those instructions.  So we would ask no further questions on the subject. 
Q.	You now talk about -- 
A.	(Microphones overlapping)...and when we committed acts and we were not prosecuted, we realised that they had also received instructions from their respective leaders.  
Q.	You mentioned a person who gave you instructions.  Which is that person? 
A.	It was Juvénal Kajelijeli who gave us instructions. 

Are you referring to the person who gave instructions to our leaders, or are you referring to the person who gave us instructions? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Asks the witness. 
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	I want to know both, but I asked you of your leaders, who gave you the instruction.  
A.	It was Dusabimana who gave us instructions, but he also received instructions from Kajelijeli. 
Q.	How do you know that Dusabimana received instructions from Kajelijeli? 
A.	Dusabimana told us that he received instructions from Kajelijeli, but I was not in his company when he went to see Kajelijeli.  However, he was the one who told us that he did, indeed, receive instructions from Kajelijeli. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, how could someone who did not know a person personally come to know that that person was an Interahamwe? 
A.	Could you please repeat your question, Counsel.  I did not quite grasp it. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, how could someone who did not know a person personally come to know that that person was an Interahamwe? 
A.	The Interahamwe of Mukingo had identity cards, or cards.  So anybody who was not a holder of such a card, I could not say was a member of the Interahamwe, as such.  The Interahamwe had cards, membership cards, belonging to the MRND, but I could also say that the Interahamwe had MRND membership cards bearing their photo. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, was there any characteristic dress for the Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes, there was. 
Q.	Can you describe that dress to us.  
A.	The Interahamwe wore kitenge fabrics, that is, a shirt and trousers of the same colour.
Q.	Which colour was that? 
A.	It was a multicoloured fabric.  I'm not quite sure whether I could provide you with all the colours.  I think there's a bit of white, green, yellow, red.  Those are the only colours that I can remember, but, as I say, it was a multicoloured fabric. 
Q.	From this point on, I want to focus more on your position as an Interahamwe.  Did you have an Interahamwe identity card? 
A.	Yes, I did have an Interahamwe membership card. 
Q.	Who gave you this Interahamwe membership card? 
A.	The Interahamwe membership cards were issued to us during our military training.  Nzirorera came and promised that we would receive uniforms and Interahamwe membership cards.  When at a later stage those kitenge uniforms were delivered to him, then he came and gave them to us.  And then he told us that our membership cards had been given to Kajelijeli, who was going to affix a stamp to them and then distribute them to us.  And once Kajelijeli had affixed said stamp, they were then distributed to us. 
Q.	Do I understand you correct, that you said that Nzirorera gave the cards to Kajelijeli who thereafter distributed them to the Interahamwe?  Is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you wear a uniform? 
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	Who gave you the uniform? 
A.	Yes. 

Nzirorera.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you call Nzirorera an Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes, I would.  When you help a thief, it means that you, yourself, are a thief.  Had he not distributed the uniforms to us, if he had not distributed that damned uniform to us, we would not have been able to commit the acts that we did, indeed, commit. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you recall any meetings that you, as a member of the Interahamwe, participated in in which Nzirorera took place (sic) as well prior to April 1994? 
A.	He asked for our leaders to come, and one day he asked for us to come and to take down the flags belonging to other political parties in Mukingo. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you've mentioned an incident concerning tearing down flags.  Can you tell me when that incident took place? 
A.	That took place when we were still part of the MRND youth movement.  That is when he came from Kigali, arrived in Mukingo, and went past the MDR flag and past the flag of the PSD in Yaoundé (phonetic), and he was informed that there were other flags in Kabere (phonetic), and that is when he gave us the instructions to go and tear down all those flags.  That was in around the month of January 1992.  And during that period, we were in the midst of organising military training. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you say "he."  I assume with -- when you mention "he" that you mean Mr. Nzirorera.  Is that a correct assumption? 
A.	Yes, it was, indeed, Nzirorera who asked us to come.  
Q.	Where did the meeting take place? 
A.	At his mother's home. 
Q.	Do you recall who participated in this meeting? 
A.	Yes.  Other people did, indeed, take part.  Niyoyita, who was conseiller -- in fact, no, it was Conseiller Nditetse -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Corrects the witness. 
THE WITNESS:
-- there was also Niyoyita, Jean Damascene; there was Baheza.  There was Karorero, who was chief warrant officer; and Nyabusore, who was the director of the ISAE in Busogo.  And that is when he took the hand of Jean Damascene Niyohita (sic), that is, Nzirorera took his hand, that of 
Jean Damascene Niyoyita, and -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, says the Kinyarwanda booth, the witness did not define precisely what he did after that.  
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I want to slow you down a little bit.
MS. VISSER:
First, I will, for the record, mention the names that you've mentioned, the ones that are on the spelling list.  Baheza is number 4 on the spelling list.  Karorero is number 40 on the spelling list.  Nyabusore is number 69 on the spelling list, and number 33 is ISAE. 
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you went a little bit too fast for me.  I want to go back.  You said first that Nzirorera came from Kigali and he asked you to tear down the flags of other parties.  That happened during that meeting; is that correct? 
A.	He gave us that order when we were at his mother's residence.  
Q.	You mentioned some of the participants of that meeting.  Were there as well other Interahamwe members that participated in that meeting? 
A.	There were, indeed.  
Q.	Can you name us some of the key participants? 
A.	There was Michel Niyigaba, who was the president of the Interahamwe; there was Dusabimana -- that was Sergeant Dusabimana, that is.  There was Habyarimana, Bagabo.  Noel was also there, Musafiri, Barebereho -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Number 8 on the list.  
THE WITNESS:
-- Ndagije (phonetic), who was the son of Bambare, and he was also present; Bimenyimana (phonetic), son of Sebigore (phonetic), was also there.
BY MS. VISSER:  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  

After that meeting, what did happen? 
A.	After the meeting, when we were told to go and tear down the flags of the other political parties, we told him that it was getting late.  It was towards the end of the day, and we told him we couldn't go that same day and we asked for a vehicle to do it.  

He told his driver, one Gikozi (phonetic), asking him to go to his -- to Bonamimana (phonetic), his brother-in-law, to bring back Nzirorera's vehicle. 
Q.	The person that said this was Mr. Nzirorera; is that correct?  You referred to him as "he."  
A.	Yes, it's him I'm talking about. 
Q.	What happened afterwards? 
A.	His driver went to fetch the car -- the vehicle, and Gikozi, the driver, with one other driver, Kinamba -- Kinamba took Nzirorera's vehicle, and we went with that vehicle to go and tear down the flags.  We went to Kabere (phonetic), and we killed someone, beat him to death.  We took his party card.  We went to -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I didn't get the name of the place where they went.
THE WITNESS:
-- and we tore down the PSD flag.  And the sergeant, the son of Bagaze (phonetic), we took him and we handed him over to Nzirorera.  

As regards the flag, which was in the Ayze (phonetic) district area, when we got there, we found policemen, and we were not able to tear down the flag.  We went back to Nzirorera, who gave us 40,000 francs as a -- a recompense, as a reward.  I remember we spent the night at the bar drinking.

BY MS. VISSER:  
Q.	Mr. Witness, after the attack and the tearing down of the flags, did you report back to Nzirorera? 
A.	Yes.  We went back to Nzirorera's mother's residence, and we handed over the flags we had torn down, and he rewarded us with the sum of 40,000 francs.  
Q.	You mentioned previously as well that you killed someone -- someone by beating that person.  Did you report on that as well to Nzirorera? 
A.	We reported it to him.  We told him that we beat them badly, but we didn't say that the person died.  
Q.	What was Nzirorera's reaction? 
A.	He was happy.  He and Setako were pleased.  He rewarded us with those 40,000 francs, and we went off.  
Q.	The second time that you went to Nzirorera's house, who were present when you arrived back? 
A.	You mean when we returned to Nzirorera's mother's house after having torn down the flags?  
Q.	Yes, that is what I mean.  
A.	We returned to Nzirorera's mother's residence and found the same people we had left in the living room of Nzirorera's mother's residence.  They were having a drink. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you recall other occasions in which you, as an Interahamwe, met with Nzirorera? 
A.	On another occasion, I remember that we met Nzirorera when we were undergoing military training at Rukingo (phonetic) commune.  He arrived.  He came to see, and he took the group of his younger brother, Nsabimana, and provided cards and the uniform to his younger brother, Nsabimana's group.  I remember also another occasion when he was reestablishing Kajelijeli in his position as a leader.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  We will come back to both of the events.  

Mr. Witness, earlier on you mentioned that part of the task of the Interahamwe was hunting down the Tutsis; is that correct? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness indicates assent.  
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	Can you describe -- describe for me a situation that you remember that hunting down the Tutsis took place in which you participated.  
A.	Personally speaking, I recall that in our capacity as Interahamwe in 1992; it was after the military training.  We were informed that the Tutsi were the accomplices of the Inyenzi, who were attacking Rwanda.  So we went to Rwankeri and to Busogo to hunt down the Tutsi because it was said that the Tutsi were hiding Inkotanyi.  

And when we got there, we found that the gendarme had evacuated all the Tutsi to the ISAE -- ISAE in Busogo.  So not having any Tutsi, we went on the Byangabo road and found that the Tutsi had been evacuated to the ISAE in Busogo, the ISAE.  We couldn't do anything, so we went back to Byariabo (sic).  And sometime later there was an Inkotanyi who fired a shot near Nzirorera's brother's house.  The Inkotanyi returned to near Muhabura Radio and said that people should not be surprised to have heard a gunshot near Nzirorera younger brother's house (sic) and that, in fact, the Inkotanyi wanted to show that they were present in the neighbourhood.  And we were told that, since the gunshot had been heard near Nsabimana's house, Nzirorera's younger brother, it was necessary for us to go into action and, therefore, to hunt down the Tutsi on that occasion again.  We went hunting for Tutsi but could not find any.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, do I understand you correct that you describe now two separate occasions? 
A.	Yes, yes. 
Q.	I want to go back to the first occasion you've mentioned.  Who gave you the instructions? 
A.	On the first occasion -- first occasion, it was Dusabe, in his capacity as president, who told us it was necessary -- necessary to go hunting the Tutsi.  
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)...do you know -- do you know from who Dusabimana got his instructions? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Dusabimana gave you the instructions and to the other Interahamwe; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did you report back to someone about the results of your action? 
A.	It was Dusabimana who would report to other people.  He was our leader.  He was the one who would give reports. 
Q.	Do you know to who he reported? 
A.	No. 
Q.	The second event, you said that was about a gunshot close to a house and that thereafter an attack took place.  Who gave the instruction? 
A.	He called us, and we gathered at the house Nzirorera had given us, and he told us that over Radio Muhabura the Tutsi had said that they were present in the neighbourhood and gave us the order to go and hunt Tutsi again.  
Q.	(Microphone not activated)...who is this person?
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Thank you, Mr. (Microphones overlapping).  
A.	Are you referring to Dusabimana? 
Q.	I asked you to whom you referred, but I assumed that it was Dusabimana, and you confirmed that assumption.  

You mentioned as well to us that you gathered in a house that was given by Nzirorera; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	He gave that house to the Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes.  He gave us that house to use as an office. 
Q.	What was the name of this house? 
A.	Isimbi Rya Busogo. 
MS. VISSER:
That is number 34 on the spelling list.  
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	Can you explain the Court (sic) the location of this house? 
A.	That house is in Byangabo, but, in fact, it is in Rwankeri secteur, the other side of the road from Nzirorera's mother's residence.  When you are at Nzirorera's mother's residence, the house is about 20 metres away.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  

You said that you got the instruction in that house, ISAE house.  What happened after you got the instructions? 
A.	We went to the place shown and found no accomplices.  We went to the place we were supposed to go.  We found no accomplices and were obliged to return -- rather, we were obliged to turn back.  
Q.	When you came back, did you report on what had happened? 
A.	Well, as to any reporting, Dusabimana was still with us.  If he reported to the people who had evacuated the Tutsi, I don't know.  I did not follow closely this business of reporting or not reporting, since there were also some Tutsi who had been arrested by the authorities and those Tutsi had been evacuated.  
Q.	When you say there were some Tutsi arrested by the authorities, the authorities, who do you mean? 
A.	Captain Hasengineza and Kajelijeli -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I forgot those names, sorry.  
THE WITNESS:
-- they had taken some Tutsi who -- who were heads of households. 
MS. VISSER:
For the record, it's number 27 on the spelling list, and Kajelijeli, number 38 on the spelling list.  
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you said that they arrested some heads of the household.  Do you recall which heads of the households they arrested? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I'm going to object to this as being incidents which are outside the scope of the indictment.  And I don't know if it's being offered for background and context, but if it is, I think we've heard enough background and context, and the expeditious nature of the trial would be advanced by not hearing any more of it.  

MS. VISSER:
I would like to respond to this, that I think it is relevant to the case.  And the witness is giving an example of the actions that took place, and I would like to proceed the way I proceed.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, if I could just draw the distinction between actions of the authorities and actions of the Interahamwe and MRND, and I've let it go.  We've talked about some things in the Interahamwe that were outside of the indictment, but I think that the line should be drawn when they start talking about the actions of the communal authorities on this military (sic). 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We uphold the objection.  
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, what are the Virunga Force, Amahindure? 
MS. VISSER:
That is number 1 on the spelling list. 
THE WITNESS:
That were -- they were Interahamwe that were being trained.
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	What was the objective of the Amahindure? 
A.	When the Interahamwe were trained, they were told that they would ensure civil defence and protect the local population.  But it is not -- that is not how things happened.  It was the same people who were trained who killed the members of the local population.  
Q.	What is, according to your knowledge, the distinction between the Amahindure and Interahamwe? 
A.	In fact, the Interahamwe who went through the training were called Amahindure. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you recall when the Amahindure was created?
A.	It was about the middle of 1992. 
Q.	Who were the founders of the Amahindure? 
A.	It was General Bizimungu who created the Amahindure, with Karorero and Bizabarimana.  Kajelijeli was also present when that -- when it was created. 
Q.	How do you know? 
A.	We were present.  We were told that it was Bizimungu who had brought firearms to Ruhehe hill, Ruhehe hill. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, a spelling list would be assisted -- would be helpful. 
MS. VISSER:
Number 80 on the spelling list. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the earlier names?  
MS. VISSER:
Bizimungu is not on the spelling list.  Karorero is on the spelling list on number 40.  Kajelijeli is on the spelling list, number 38. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  There was one other name that I actually didn't catch myself.  It was something like Bizabarimana, Biziyeryimana (sic), something like that.  Maybe the witness can clarify.  
MS. VISSER:
That is number 12 on the list. 
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you mention a name Bizabarimana as well? 
A.	Yes, that's it, Major Bizabarimana, Bizabarimana.  
Q.	So you were there when the Amahindure was created; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, in the beginning, at the ceremony of creation of the group; that is correct.  But later when they were trained, I was not present -- when they were undergoing training, I was not present.  
Q.	Were you a member of the Amahindure as well? 
A.	Yes, I was one -- a member of the group that underwent the training.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, now I want to direct your attention to the training you received as an Interahamwe.  Did you get --

MR. PRESIDENT:
You may continue.  
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I want to direct your attention to the training that you received as an Interahamwe.  Did you get any training? 
A.	Yes, I did. 
Q.	What kind of training did you receive? 
A.	I learned how to handle weapons.  I learned how to use grenades, and I was instructed in other military exercises, such as raids, and also how to man a roadblock. 
Q.	Do you recall when this training took place? 
A.	That was before we received our uniforms.  I believe that during the months of the year 1992, that is, towards the middle of the year -- 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)...Mr. Witness -- Mr. Witness, where did the training take place? 
A.	At Mukingo communal office. 
Q.	Could the public -- could the public see your training, or was it hidden from the public? 
A.	When we went there in the morning, the population could see us.  But as regards the training, as such, well, that took place in some woods off the beaten track, and, as a result, the population could not see that training going on.  
Q.	Who gave the training? 
A.	Soldiers, reservists, that is, were the ones who provided the training, or they were also sometimes still active soldiers, Karorero, for example, who was chief warrant officer, and he was based at 
	Mukamira camp.  
MS. VISSER:
For the record, Karorero is number 40 on the list, Mukamira camp is number 53 on the list.

Q.	How long did your training last? 
A.	I believe that the training lasted for two months. 
Q.	Besides you, how many people were being trained?  Can you give us an estimation? 
A.	They were numerous.  They came from Gitaga (phonetic), from Busogo, and from Nyabirere (phonetic).  So people from Rwinzovu came with a view to receiving military training.  
MS. VISSER:
Rwinzovu is number 86 on the spelling list, for the record. 
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I asked you to give an estimation.  You are not able to give an estimation? 
A.	It is difficult for me to provide an approximation.  It was approximately 300. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, did any dignitaries participate or attend these meetings -- these trainings? 
A.	During the training Kajelijeli would come to see Habyarimana, and Nzirorera would also come. 
Q.	For the record, the name that you mentioned second, is that Habyaberere?  Is that correct? 
A.	I just said that the leaders came to the training ground.  There was Kajelijeli, Bizabarimana.  They would come, and Nzirorera also came.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  

You mentioned that Nzirorera came and attended the training.  Did he address the group? 
A.	He came at a time when we were receiving training.  There was a group of 50 young people, and it was his brother, that is, Sergeant Dusabe, who was giving us that training.  He promised us kitenge uniforms and also Interahamwe membership cards. 
Q.	Did he keep his promise? 
A.	Yes.  He distributed the uniforms to us in Rukaro at his residence.  As regards the Interahamwe cards, well, he gave them to Kajelijeli, who then distributed them to the Interahamwe.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you get any additional training? 
A.	In fact, I told you that we were initially told how to use grenades and firearms, and then we were trained in tactics, notably, how to organise a raid, how to check vehicles at roadblocks, et cetera, et cetera.  We were also instructed in different techniques that one can use in order to capture somebody, notably via an ambush, for example.  
Q.	How long did this training last, or is this training in -- comprised into the training that you've already mentioned before? 
A.	No.  That stage of training lasted for one month.  
Q.	And does this training take place immediately after your general training? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Who gave this training? 
A.	It was Karorero, the chief warrant officer; Corporal Ndagije (phonetic); and Musafiri; and Noel.  All those people were the ones to provide us with training.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you provided us with a lot of names.  Can you please restate them slowly.  
A.	The first was the chief warrant officer, Karorero.  The second was Sergeant Dusabimana.  He was the brother of Nzirorera.  The third was Corporal Bihamimana (phonetic).  He was the son of -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm afraid the interpreter did not catch that. 
THE WITNESS;

BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you talk about Noel, is that Noel Ndayisabye? 
A.	That was Ndayisabye, Noel.  
MS. VISSER:
Can the Kinyarwanda booth help us with the spelling?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
You spell that N-D-A-Y-I-S-A-B-Y-E. 
MS. VISSER:
(Microphones overlapping)...okay.  That is number 59 on the spelling list.
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you've mentioned earlier that you received your uniform from Mr. Nzirorera at his residence in Rukaro.  Did Nzirorera himself give you the uniform? 
A.	It was he, himself.  He was at home in front of his residence.  
Q.	Did he address the group? 
A.	He'd summoned us through his brother, Dusabe.  And when we arrived at that place, he gave us the uniforms and also told us that cards had been given to Kajelijeli, who would, in turn, give them to the Interahamwe.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  

After your training was finished, did you, as Interahamwe, keep coming together? 
A.	Yes.  We would meet him at the house called Isimbi Rya Busogo at Byangabo. 
Q.	How often would you meet there? 
A.	Four times a week.  In the mornings we'd meet there.  
Q.	Do you recall what time in the morning? 
A.	Up about 6.  By 7 we'd already be gathered together there at that house. 
Q.	What would you do there? 
A.	We would hold meetings there, and the people responsible would tell us what had happened in their meetings, and we'd discuss the activities of the group. 
Q.	The leaders of the group would tell about their meetings.  Can you explain something more about their meetings, with whom they met? 
A.	Our leaders would come and tell us, "Well, we attended an MRND meeting and we were asked to do this or that."  And they told us that they'd met Kajelijeli and the others.  As far as I was concerned, when I heard that, whereas I did not see those leaders, I was satisfied with whatever Dusabe told us.  And if he told us he met -- he'd met the leaders, I had confidence in what he told me.

A.	Yes, it was clear to us.  We were told the enemy was the Tutsi, and I saw it clearly in the course of an incident where Gasahani, Segahwege and Bukumba were brought.  And those people never came back.  However, on the contrary, they were killed.

A.	At Byangabo and, more specifically, at the house that Nzirorera had given us, the house named 
	Isimbi Rya Busogo. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:

BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, why did you go there? 
A.	I went to the marketplace while thinking, in any case, they will be giving us work to do, once you've been given a card and a uniform, since Habyarimana was dead.  I went to that place while thinking that necessary -- of necessity they would be giving us work to do. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you refer to "work to do," what do you mean by that? 
A.	I have told you that we were already hunting Tutsi before, because we were told that the Tutsi was the enemy.  And it's along those lines when we went to that place, we expected -- we thought that we would necessarily be hunting for the Tutsi that had killed Habyarimana because that is what was being said. 
Q.	Do you recall what time you got at Isimbi house? 
A.	I left my house at 5:30, and I arrived at Isimbi house a few minutes before 6.

A.	It was Dusabe who told us what was said at the meeting held at his place.  He told us that at the meeting it was decided to go and kill Tutsi -- the Tutsi. 
Q.	Did Dusabe or Dusabimana participate in that meeting? 
A.	All those people found him at home.  He was at his mother's house, so I think he must have been there. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you recall what happened after the meeting took place?  
A.	As to what occurred, Dusabe came to find us at Isimbi house and told us that the meeting had decided that we should go and kill the Tutsi, inasmuch as it was the Tutsi who had shot down the president's plane.  We answered that we had no materiel.  He answered by saying that Bizabarimana had undertaken to provide us with the necessary materiel.

Bizabarimana is number 12 on the spelling list.

Some Tutsi had fled.  They were armed with bows and arrows and machetes.

Q.	Mr. Witness, did you receive a gun? 
A.	I was given grenades.  
Q.	What happened after the group of Interahamwe were armed and you got a grenade? 
A.	Those who were armed with rifles started shooting at the Tutsis, the ones who were throwing stones at us, and the ones who were using bows and arrows to fire arrows at us.  And those of us who were in the possession of grenades threw them into different houses, where we killed all the Tutsis who were in -- inside those houses.  Some survivors fled to the convent.  

At approximately 3 p.m., somebody came to inform us that some Tutsis had taken refuge at the convent.  It was Bikete, Kajelijeli's brother, who was a teacher, who gave us that information.  Then the Interahamwe went to the convent.  And when I was on the way, I saw that a cow had ended up in a pond, and that is how I stopped my journey to Busogo and I took care of the cow.  In fact, I put an end to its days.  
Q.	What did you do after killing the cow?  
A.	I then took the meat home, and on the way, I came across*************, who was in the company of two children, and I then went to a place where*************************************, killed that specific person and their children.

Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  After this person with the two children was being killed, what did you do? 
A.	After *************and the two children were killed, the group that had gone to the convent came back, and we came across them in the market.  We were told that in Rubare there were Tutsis who had resisted and who were hiding inside their homes and who were armed with bows and arrows.  We went to that location in a vehicle.  So, the Interahamwe went there in a vehicle, and they reached said location when the sun was setting.  We could do nothing, so we went back the way we had come and we spent the night near the Petrorwanda petrol station.  And on the next morning, we went back to Nyabirehe, so that is to Rubare. 
Q.	Mr. Witness -- Mr. Witness, you mentioned Rubare.  In which location in Rubare?

The corporal from Bigogwe had brought some fuel with him, and he poured this fuel over the straw home and the house burnt.  Then, when one of the Tutsis fired or shot at -- using his bow and arrow -- shot at Noel using his bow and arrow...

A.	After that, the fuel was poured over the house that was then set alight.  And we went to check in another house, and we noted that there were people hiding in the fake ceiling.  We also poured fuel there and we set the building alight.  When we noted that people were falling from the false ceiling, we then left. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you said "we" set it afire.  Did anyone give you the order?  
A.	When Kajelijeli and Bambonye ordered us to kill even fetuses that were still in the bellies of their mother, then the person whose name I mentioned took that fuel and poured it over Kizungu's house, and that is how we came to set those buildings alight.  
MS. VISSER: 
For the record, Bambonye is number 7 on the list, Kajelijeli 38.  
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, those attacks on the 7th and on the 8th of April, can you estimate how many people were killed? 
A.	There were numerous victims, approximately 300 people, in fact, more than 300 people. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, now I want to direct your attention to the court of appeal attack.  Can you explain the Court when this attack took place?  An approximation is good enough.  
A.	The attack took place between the 12th and the 14th.  
Q.	Who committed the attack? 
A.	The Interahamwe from Mukingo committed the attack, but they had been called as reinforcements to the Ruhengeri Interahamwe.  
Q.	Who gave the order to the Interahamwe of Mukingo to attack the court of appeal? 
A.	It was Kajelijeli, Baheza, and Karorero, the chief warrant officer, who ordered the Interahamwe to launch those attacks. 
MS. VISSER: 
For the record number, Kajelijeli is 38 on the list, Karorero number 40 on the list, and Baheza number 4 on the list.  
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, who gave the order to the Interahamwe from Ruhengeri, as far as you recall? 
A.	We were told that it was Bizimungu. 
Q.	Who told you that? 
A.	It was the president of the Ruhengeri Interahamwe by the name of Gapeli. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you said that you got the orders as the Interahamwe from Mukingo from Kajelijeli, Karorero, Baheza.  Where did you receive those orders? 
A.	We were at the Petrorwanda petrol station in Baheza.  That is where we received orders. 
Q.	Can you recall what order was made to you and the other Interahamwe? 
A.	The Interahamwe from Ruhengeri came to see us.  We refused.  They then went to speak to Baheza and Kajelijeli, and we were called to the Petrorwanda petrol station, and we were asked to go and help the others in Ruhengeri.  We had to go and help the Ruhengeri Interahamwe to take care of those Tutsi at the court of appeal.  It was Kajelijeli and his group who gave us that order. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, after this order, did you, as the Interahamwe of Mukingo, go to the court of appeal? 
A.	After that order, we told them we didn't have the necessary materiels.  The warrant officer told us he had those materiels at his house and told us we could use them.  So we went off in a vehicle to collect other members of the CDR who were at Gervais' house in Mukamira. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, what is Gervais' surname? 
A.	He was a businessman who worked in Mukamira.  I don't know his other name. 
Q.	And it is not Musafiri, Gervais, the Interahamwe, that you are referring to?  
A.	Musafiri was the son of Rusahira (phonetic).  He was not a leader.  I'm talking of Gervais, who was a big businessman based in Mukamira, president of the CDR in Mukamira. 
Q.	Thank you for your explanation, Mr. Witness.  

After you passed by there, what happened?  
A.	When we arrived there, the warrant officer gave me three grenades, M26 -- two M26 and one Chinese type.  It was Kajelijeli who bought fuel.  We went down to Byangabo.  We stopped there.  Other people got on board our vehicle. 
Q.	You mentioned other people got on board.  Is that other Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes.  Interahamwe got in our vehicle when we stopped at Byangabo. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, thereafter, you went in that vehicle to the court of appeal; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What weapons were used in the attack? 
A.	Kalashnikov, R4s, grenades, machetes, and small hatchets -- small hoes. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Correction, small hoes.  
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	When you arrived at the court of appeal, how -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Isn't this covered by fact 61?  
MS. VISSER: 
That is correct.  
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, the Interahamwe from Mukingo that were participating in this attack, were those Interahamwe the same Interahamwe that participated as well in the meetings at Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house? 
A.	They were Interahamwe who had taken part in a meeting at the house Nzirorera had given us.  They are the Interahamwe who went on the attack against the court of appeals.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, after the attack of the court of appeal, did you hear any radio announcement about this attack? 
A.	Yes, I heard a communiqué, an announcement about it. 
Q.	What was the content of that announcement? 
A.	They announced that "The (unintelligible) Inyenzi killed our people at the appeals court."  That's what they announced -- the communiqué stated. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, this is in contradiction with the event how you described it; is that correct? 
A.	You're saying I said what?
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I say the content of the radio broadcast was different than the content of your testimony; is that correct? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why does the witness have to answer that?  
MS. VISSER: 
Mr. President, I can go further.  

BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you've just mentioned that there was a broadcast that it was the Tutsi that killed Interahamwe.  Why would it be broadcast in that way, to your knowledge?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Objection, Mr. President.  That calls for speculation.  I don't think he had any relationship with 
Radio Rwanda that he could answer that question.  
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I will move on.  After the attack of the court of appeal, what did you do? 
A.	After the attack on the appeals court, Rukara told us that Bizimungu (unintelligible) was with his aunt who was in the Ibereshi neighbourhood, and we went to kill her, and it was Noel who shot her to death. 
MS. VISSER: 
For the record, Rukara is number 81 on the list.  Ibereshi is not on the spelling list.  
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you mentioned that Noeli killed this woman.  When you say Noeli, what is his surname? 
A.	Ndayisaba, Noel Ndayisaba. 
MS. VISSER: 
Number 59 on the spelling list.  
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, after the killing of this aunt of Rukara, what happened afterwards to you? 
A.	They gave us 25,000 francs.  The money wasn't given to me personally, but when we got to the brigade, the gendarmes stopped us.  I was with************************.  I was also with 
	*****************.  And they detained us.  They locked us up at the brigade, the police station. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you're talking about two things.  I first want to ask you something more about the money that was given to you.  Who gave that money? 
A.	A short man we met in Ruhengeri.  He's the one who gave us that money. 
Q.	Do you know why the money was given to you? 
A.	He gave us that money at a roadblock that was right next to the SGB petrol station.  He was told us that it was as a reward the money was given to us and we should share it with the Ruhengeri Interahamwe. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, a reward for what? 
A.	He gave us that money because we'd just gotten rid of the Tutsi that had been taken to the appeals court for him, according to what he said. 
Q.	The second fact that you were talking about, was that a gendarme who stopped you; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  The gendarme stopped us.  We were a group of ********individuals. 
Q.	What happened after they stopped you? 
A.	They jailed us.  **********of us were locked up because the driver was allowed to leave. 
Q.	Did they give you a reason for your arrest? 
A.	They didn't say anything. 
Q.	You mentioned that three people were -- got arrested:  you and two other people.  Can you name those two other people? 
A.	The second person was*******************************************************************. 
MS. VISSER: 
******************************************************is not on the spelling list. 
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you said that you were arrested.  Who arrested you?  
A.	It was gendarme. 
Q.	Where did he take you? 
A.	To the brigade, the police station. 
Q.	And upon arrival at the police station, were you told why you were arrested? 
A.	Once we had arrived at the police station, we were put in a cell and, at that time, Dusabe arrived.  When he arrived, he asked the gendarme to release us, and they refused.  He went off and after a while came back and then we were released and went home.  
MS. VISSER: 
For the record, Dusabe is number 16 on the spelling list.  
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you mentioned that Dusabe or Dusabimana left for a while and came back and you were released.  What did he do?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, before this question is answered, which I understood the witness is being asked to speculate on or to testify about what Dusabimana did outside of his presence, and I want to make an objection to this on a number of grounds.  First of -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)...of order, Mr. Robinson.  My note of the actual question is "What did you do"?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  Then I have no problem with that question.  
THE WITNESS:
Dusabe came, obtained our release and we went off.  As far as I'm concerned, I didn't do anything special.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, apparently the English transcript is different to the French transcript.  My note of your question was, "Mr. Witness, you mentioned that Dusabe or Dusabimana left for a while, came back and you were released.  What did you do?"  At that stage, Mr. Robinson interrupted.  But I gather that in the French something else came out.  What was your question?  

MS. VISSER: 
Mr. President, I will rephrase the question.  
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, did Dusabe -- one moment. 

Mr. Witness, did there come a time that you learned what Dusabimana did when he left you?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President, this is what I was trying to get at by my objection.  And this is -- I have a rather broad objection to this.  This is opening an area which is not included in the indictment in addition to calling for some speculation and also very unreliable hearsay, since the only person who is the -- the declarant is deceased, so I don't know how much you want me to elaborate, but this is an area where we don't think it should be enquired into. 
MS. VISSER: 
I want to make a comment that hearsay is admissible and that it's all a question of the weight that is given to the hearsay evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The rules specifically say that hearsay is admissible.  We're going to have to assess its weight in due course.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, perhaps we could ask the Kinyarwandan booth not interpret these remarks that I'm going to make.  My objection is broader than that, and I'd rather not have the witness -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you ask the witness to remove his headset as well.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, the testimony that I anticipate to be elicited at this juncture is that Dusabimana claimed that he contacted Mr. Nzirorera, who had telephoned the people to get -- get these -- these people who attacked the court of appeals released, and it's our position that that's a material fact that should have been in the indictment.  It is in the witness summary for Witness GBU, but nevertheless, we feel that that is a form of -- essentially a form of liability, since there's no evidence that Mr. Nzirorera ordered the attack of any participation or involvement in it.  So what the Prosecutor is trying to do by this evidence is to make Mr. Nzirorera liable for -- as almost an accessory after the fact to this.  And I don't think that -- if they were trying to do that, they shouldn't -- that should have simply left it to the small sentence in a witness statement but should have been a material fact that was pled in the indictment.  So that's in addition to my argument that the hearsay comes from a deceased person who is alleged to have participated in many killings and can hardly be described as reliable, given the testimony about him that you've heard.  Thank you.  

MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I would suggest that that's a rather formalistic -- formalistic objection.  This witness testified in the first Karemera trial.  This evidence is not new to Mr. Robinson.  He gave the same evidence the first time that he testified.  It's in the witness summary for the pre-trial brief.  The Defence have been on notice of this particular fact and this aspect of the witness's testimony for years.  So, this is not a question of unfairly surprising the Defence or not giving them adequate notice. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, we had -- at the beginning of the session we had indicated the information which would be required by the Court in response to objections of this nature.  Now you sandwiched in this, as a comment, that it was in the pre-trial brief.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, which Mr. Robinson himself acknowledged.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
So it's -- it is clearly part of the theory of our case, and it was -- adequate notice was given to the Defence.  With respect to the -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The only other thing you have to comment on, then, is the issue, is it a material fact?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I would not suggest that it's a material fact, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson has suggested that.  Do you have a comment?
MR. WEBSTER: 
That this is the evidence that we're using to prove the broad allegation that Nzirorera is responsible for the court -- for the court of appeal's attack.  The attack is pleaded in the indictment.  In the caption of the charge it mentions not only 6.3 liability, but 6.1 aiding and abetting.  To me it's clearly covered. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Unintelligible).  The objection is overruled. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I don't want to belabour this, but I would like to correct something 
Mr. Webster said.  At the first trial, this evidence was excluded by the previous Trial Chamber because they ruled that we did not have adequate notice of it, and the evidence was stricken.  Thereafter, the Prosecutor amended its indictment but did not choose to include this allegation in the amended indictment.  They did put it in the last second of the second-to-last paragraph of the witness summary appended to the pre-trial brief.  That's the actual state of the fact and the notice. 

MR. WEBSTER: 
I don't think that changes my response at all, Your Honour.  I'd have to go back and look at the record in terms of whether this portion of the witness's testimony was excluded or not, because I don't have a clear recollection of that.  But even if that's the case, my argument still stands.  It's still the Defence had been on notice.  They have heard this testimony before.  It's pleaded in the indictment to the extent that the indictment pleads aiding and abetting.  This incident is squarely pleaded in the indictment, which was not the case, I don't think, during the first trial when we were working with the other indictment.  So my submission to the Court is that we've adequately given the Defence notice.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are going to take lunch now, but, Mr. Robinson, the (unintelligible) of our ruling has to do with the inclusion of this in the pre-trial brief in support of the allegation of the attack and the indictment and we think the rules are satisfied by that. 

We take the luncheon break now.  
(Court recessed at 1230H) 
(Pages 22 to 35 by Sherri Knox)






















(Court resumed at 1410H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  

You may continue. 
MS. VISSER:
Good afternoon.  Mr. President, I expect that I need one more hour this afternoon for the examination-in-chief. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, this morning you testified about your arrest; do you recall that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You mentioned to the Court that Dusabe came; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know how Dusabe knew where you were? 
A.	He told us that he had been informed by the driver who had been released, and he had known that we had been arrested and detained. 
Q.	Dusabe or Dusabimana tried to free you; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	He did not succeed and he left you for 20 minutes; is that correct?
A.	Yes, it is. 
Q.	Did he tell you what he was going to do in those 20 minutes? 
A.	No, he did not tell us, but he told us that he would come back in a few moments, and we saw him come back. 
Q.	Did there come a time that you got to know what he did during those 20ish minutes? 
A.	After he had secured our release, he told us that he had phoned Nzirorera.  And it was Nzirorera who had ordered that we be released. 
Q.	How long did you have to stay in gaol in total? 
A.	We stayed there for about one hour. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you just told me that Dusabimana told you that he had phoned Nzirorera.  When did he say that to you?  Was it on the same day?  Was it much later?  Give us an estimation. 
A.	He gave us that information a day after our release.  But at the time we were leaving the brigade, he said that it was out of the question that we would spend the night in the brigade. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Moving on to a different subject:  After the start of the genocide in April 1994, did you see or meet Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	I saw Nzirorera during the swearing-in of Juvénal Kajelijeli.  And at that time he said Kajelijeli had done well by way of work.  So, it was a proper move to swear him in his new position. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you remember when this event took place? 
A.	That ceremony took place after the end of the genocide.  It was somewhere in the month of May, or mid-May 1994. 
Q.	Where did the event take place? 
A.	The ceremony took place at Bisesero -- Gisesero. 
MS. VISSER:
For the record, Gisesero is number 24 on the spelling list. 
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you mentioned to us previously that the meeting took place in mid-May.  How do you know that it was mid-may? 
A.	I say so because about two months afterwards we went away on exile. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know who organised the event? 
A.	We were requested to go to the Gisesero stadium.  Apart from me seeing Nzirorera placing the scarf on Kajelijeli, at that time he was in the company of someone else.  I can't really tell you who organised that ceremony. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you say "we were requested".  By whom were you requested to go to Gisesero? 
A.	Dusabe was also an Interahamwe, was the one who asked us to go to Gisesero. 
Q.	Do you know from whom he got his orders? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have now explained to me who requested you, but you mentioned as well "we were requested", who was the "we"? 
A.	We were the Interahamwe of Mukingo. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have mentioned in the beginning of your testimony, the leaders of the youth, the leaders of the Interahamwe; were all of those leaders at that event? 
A.	Yes, they were present at that ceremony. 
Q.	Do you recall how many Interahamwe in total were present? 
A.	There were lots of them.  Some of them had also come from Gataraga.  I think we were about 
	200 Interahamwe; of course, that is just an estimate. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you describe to the Court what happened during this gathering and in chronological order, please? 
A.	When Nzirorera came we danced.  We had wooden rifles and we also staged a march passed.  Mr. Nzirorera went to the podium.  He was in the company of another person, whose name I do not know.  And he said the following things:  "This man has been relieved of his duties.  Now we are coming to swear him in again into his position." 
Q.	Mr. Witness -- 
A.	Okay, we sung the song which belonged to Rachel, who was a Tutsi. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you mentioned that Nzirorera spoke and that he said this man was relieved of his duties.  When you are saying "this man", who did Nzirorera refer to? 
A.	He was referring to Kajelijeli.  He said that man had been relieved of his duties as bourgmestre.  And then at that time following his actions in Mukingo, he would be sworn in into that position again. 
Q.	When you talk about "his actions in Mukingo", what do you mean by those actions in Mukingo? 
A.	The killings we had perpetrated.  So actually he was being rewarded for the killings we had perpetrated. 
Q.	What happened after this speech of Nzirorera? 
A.	The person accompanying him also spoke.  And in his speech he said someone like Kajelijeli had to be restated -- reinstated in his position on account of his actions.  However, I don't know that person.  After the ceremony, Nzirorera and his group went up and we sought to know from Dusabe whether we were not entitled to something to drink.  He went to his mother's residence and he came back with money, which he used to buy drinks for us. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The name of the lady was Nyizamakuba. 
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you said he went to his house.  Who do you mean with "he"? 
A.	Dusabe. 
Q.	On that meeting that took place, where the Interahamwe paraded, did Nzirorera address the Interahamwe? 
A.	Nzirorera congratulated us.  He said we deserved a reward.  So, we were given that song belonging to the Tutsi lady.  We were promised money, and we were told that those who would not contribute would face the consequences.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It was not a song, correction from the interpreter, it was the field or a farm. 
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, did Mr. Nzirorera explain why you got the reward? 
A.	Nzirorera said we had worked well and that we had carried out some commendable actions.  By killing the Tutsis we had done something good. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you mentioned as well something about a field of Rachel.  Can you explain to the Court what you meant with the field of Rachel? 
A.	What I mean is that that lady in question was a Tutsi.  Now, their farm lands had been confiscated.  So, it was a piece of farm land the Interahamwe grew cabbage or maize on the field. 
MS. VISSER:
For clarification for the record, this is a Tutsi woman named Rachel, and it is not the Rachel that is mentioned in the spelling list under number 76. 
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, who was the one in charge of the distribution of the land? 
A.	Kajelijeli was the one in charge.  Niyoyita, Jean Damascene, was also responsible for distribution.  There were also some policemen, but it was Nzirorera who had to request that we be given that piece of land. 
MS. VISSER:
For the record, Niyoyita is number 63 on the spelling list. 
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	After this distribution of the land did something else happen, or was that the end of the meeting? 
A.	They carried on going about their everyday business, whereas, we talked to Dusabimana, asking to get us something to drink.  Dusabimana then went to his mother's home, came back with some money and brought us something to drink. 
Q.	Did Dusabemana tell you where the money came from? 
A.	He said that it was a way of recompensing us, and that Nzirorera was the one who had stomped up that recompense, that he had asked for us to be brought drinks and for us to talk at that location. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I will now come to a more general question.  Mr. Witness, what are the Bagogwe? 
A.	The Bagogwe are Tutsis. 
Q.	Can you explain to the Court some more?  Were they a specific group of Tutsi or living in a specific area; are you able to explain a little bit? 
A.	The Bagogwe people lived in Bigogwe, close to the military camp.  There was also a place that was commonly known as the Bigogwe rocks. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I come now to my final line of questions.  On the 7th of April, Joyce was raped.  Were you present at this rape? 
A.	She was raped in Rudatinya's residence.  I was standing close to an electric pylon that was located in the surrounding area. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you see who the perpetrators were? 
A.	Yes, I did. 
Q.	Who were the perpetrators? 
A.	It was Mbonankira, Gapfogo, who was an Interahamwe.  He was the son of Semicucu.  The other person was Nteziyaremye, who was the son of Bihemu. 
MS. VISSER:
The name of the first perpetrator on the list is number 19.  
BY MS. VISSER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you mentioned that those perpetrators were Interahamwe.  Were they at the meetings that took place at Nzirorera's mother's house when Nzirorera addressed the Interahamwe? 
A.	Are you talking about the occasion when he asked us to go and tear down the flags, or are you referring to the other occasion on which the kitenge uniforms were distributed?  Whatever the case may be, those people were present on those two occasion. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness, for that elaborate answer; I was mentioning, as well, both occasions.  
MS. VISSER:
This is the end of my examination-in-chief.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Madam Prosecutor.  I commend you on the saving of time in the published estimate of your examination-in-chief.  Thank you very much.  

Now, Mr. Witness, you are going to have to answer questions from counsel representing the three Accused persons.  I am not sure who is going first.  Mr. Robinson, counsel for Nzirorera, will be the first person who will be examining you.  And you now have to answer his questions.

Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

And at this time, if the registry could distribute my exhibits.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	All right, Witness GBU, (Kinyarwanda spoken). 
A.	News is good. 
Q.	Witness GBU, it is true, is it not, that you have discussed these events that you testified to at this trial on many occasions with people in Rwanda, the authorities, with the Office of the Prosecutor, and at gacaca, and at other trials at this Tribunal, correct? 
A.	Yes, I have discussed that. 
Q.	And I have collected what you have said on each of those occasions.  And we are going to go over them to see whether or not what you have said in the past is consistent with what you have said at this trial.

Now, can you tell us approximately when were you arrested when you returned from exile?  
A.	I was arrested in the month of March, in 1997. 
Q.	And do you recall that on the**************************, you met with a police inspector in Mukingo by the name of Rukira, that is R-U-K-I-R-A, Muhisea, M-U-H-I-S-E-A.  And he put some question to you concerning these events? 
A.	Yes, I understand. 
Q.	And I'm reading from the statement that was taken by Mr. Rukira.  And it says that he asked you what were the circumstances of Rukara's death.  And your answer was, "I know nothing about that."  Is that what you told Rukara back in 1997? 
A.	I responded by saying that because of the time when I was arrested, I did not admit to any crimes, so I did not want to appear guilty at the time.  I was doing everything in my power in order to deny. 
Q.	And at the end of this statement when you put your thumb print, it says that, "I swear that the deposition is sincere."  So, when you took that oath and you swore that the deposition was sincere, you were, in fact, not telling the truth, correct? 
A.	Yes, by appending my thumb print I knew that it was not the truth because I did not admit to the facts.  What I wanted to do, in fact, was disassociate myself entirely from those events. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I would ask that the first document in my bundle of exhibits, the statement of ***************, be admitted as D. NZ243A for the Kinyarwanda, B for the French and C for the English. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit Nos. D. NZ243A, D. NZ243B and D. NZ243C admitted under seal) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I expect -- well, I will object to the admission of the statement.  I assume the Court is going to overrule the objection, but I would like to preserve it.  At some point towards the end of the Prosecution evidence, it is quite likely that the Office of the Prosecution will file a motion to request that the Court exclude evidence, based on the way it was taken under Rule 95.  If you look at, I believe I have made a similar application in the past, but Rule 95 is a provision for the exclusion of evidence on the grounds by the means by which it was obtained.  

This witness in his direct examination mentioned being hit several times by Rukira during the course of the questioning.  And we will have other witnesses from Ruhengeri and we'll lay a foundation for the proposition that statements taken under circumstances that are inherently coercive are unreliable and should be excluded.  So, I make that objection now so that it is timely.  And we will follow up on this through other witnesses towards the end of the case. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is noted. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness GBU, do you recall on the *********************you appeared at the Ruhengeri tribunal of first instance in front of a man named Appolinaire, that is A-P-P-O-L-I-N-A-I-R-E, Kayitavu,                  K-A-Y-I-T-A-V-U- Mpumuro, M-P-U-M-U-R-O.  And I'm referring to document 2 in my bundle of exhibits, in which he too put questions to you concerning these events.  
A.	Those people also questioned me on the subject of those events. 
Q.	And among the things that you told them -- did you tell them that you had stayed indoors for a whole week following Habyarimana's death? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Let me read from the text of your questions and answers with the prosecutor in Ruhengeri on the    *********************.  And I'm going to tell what you are recorded as having said, and you can tell me whether that is accurate.  The question was:  "You are accused with other Interahamwe of killing Rukara, Rusiyani" -- that is R-U-S-I-Y-A-N-I -- "Kaboyi" -- that is number 37 on the spelling list" -- and a man who had come from Gisenyi for a training course at the ISAE, and for participating in the killings which took place in Busogo." 

And you are recorded as having answered:  "I did not kill anybody at that location.  I know Rukara and Rusinyani, they lived at Byangabo, but I do not know the circumstances of their death.  As regards the young man from Gisenyi, I do not know him.  

We heard on radio that people were to stay home following Habyarimana's death.  I stayed indoors for a whole week and then went to the market, to the house of ********************************************** ***************-- "and there I heard people saying that Rukara and Rusinyani had died.  They did not mention the killers."  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, a little slowly, please. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Sorry.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	"They did not mention the killers."  Did you say that? 
A.	I would like to say the following, before pleading guilty I did not want anything to transpire in my responses that I was involved in any way whatsoever in those murders, and that is why I responded in such a manner. 
Q.	Okay.  And then you are also recorded as having said that the soldiers were about to kill you too because you were Tutsi.  Did you claim to be a Tutsi in order to get yourself out of this problem? 
A.	Yes, indeed, that is what I said. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I would ask that the document number 2 in my packet, the ***************  statement, be admitted as Exhibit 244 -- D. NZ244, again with A being Kinyarwanda, B French and C in English.  And all of these documents should be admitted under seal because they reveal the identity of the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal.  And that applies to the previous exhibits as well. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ244A, D. NZ244B and D. NZ244C admitted, under seal)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness GBU, I have a record of your having appeared on the ********************1997 at the court of first instance and being asked -- or being explained the law concerning your right to submit to the confession and guilty plea procedure.  And it is indicated in this record that at that time, and this is the *******************1997 that you said you did not wish to resort to the confession and guilty plea procedure; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is, indeed, the case.  I did not resort to the confession and guilty plea procedure because I did not recognise the fact that I had committed those crimes. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
And Mr. President, if that document can be admitted as D. NZ245A, B and C, under seal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ245A and D. NZ245B admitted, under seal)
MR. ROBINSON: 
Actually, Mr. President, I don't have a record of a French version of that document, so at this time I would just offer the Kinyarwanda as A and the English as B. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, can you assist with the French version? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
We can look for it.  I assume that we don't have it if Mr. Robinson didn't include it in his bundle, but we will look and if we have it, we will certainly make it available to the Court. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness GBU, I have a record of your appearing before what is called an examining council or a chamber du conseil on the *******************1997, with some other people, and those people being **************************************************************************************************************, in which you were being asked about whether you had participated in the killing of the family of*********** *********************************************************.  Do you remember appearing before the examining counsel concerning those killings? 
A.	Well, when exactly is that question supposed to have been asked of me?  Are you saying that it was the examining council that put that question to me?  
Q.	I'm saying that you appeared before the examining council, as far as I have my record, and that it was the prosecuting officer who participated and either -- I'm not sure if the prosecuting officer or the judge put that question to you, but someone at that proceeding put the question to you.  Do you recall that? 
A.	I do not remember. 

MR. WEBSTER:  
Now that Mr. Robinson has paused a bit, let me just say for the record, the document that we referred to just a moment ago, D. NZ245, is actually a French language document.  So, we have it in both languages now.  It was not Kinyarwanda. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. Webster. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What did the registry get?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I believe they got one French and one English. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you.  

Madam Registrar. 
MS. KOUO:
French and English, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The numbering, that can be B and C or -- 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, D. NZ245A and B; A for French, B for English. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
MR. ROBINSON: 
And, Mr. President, if the witness could be shown the Kinyarwanda version of the document number 4 in my packet of exhibits.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness GBU, I understand that you are not able to read, but I want to direct your attention to the last page and see if you see your name as one of the signatories there.  Do you see your name there on the last page? 
A.	I would request that I be shown where my name is written because I know neither how to read nor write. 
Q.	Okay.  Well, if you could look on the last page of that, there are three pages in front of you, and you go to the very last page.  Do you have the last page? 
A.	I suppose you are referring to the third page, Counsel. 
Q.	That is correct.  And right in the middle of that page on the left-hand side, there is a name and a signature.  It is the very first one where there is a name and underneath there looks like a signature.  Do you see that? 
A.	Yes, I can see the first name.  Yes, there it is. 
Q.	That is yours, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Okay.  So, within this document it is recorded that you were asked whether or not you knew the people who killed the family of*************************, and you said you did not know them.  Was that true?   
A.	Are you saying that I said that I did not know them?  Well, I said that I did not know them during the period where I had not yet resorted to the confession and guilty plea procedure because I did not want to associate myself with any of those crimes. 
Q.	Okay, and then at the same proceeding after you were questioned, there were some questions of Rukundo.  And he also said he didn't know who had killed the family of*************************.  And he said, "I was in hiding too as they wanted to kill me too."  Was that statement by Alexis Rukundo true; was he in hiding on the 7th of April? 
A.	Well, he expressed himself by saying that -- well, at the time he did not recognise that he had committed those crimes, and he did not see where the interest lay for him in resorting to the confession and guilty plea procedure.  In fact, he was forced to take part in the killings during the genocide in view of the fact that his mother was a Tutsi. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I would ask that this chamber of council document, which is in French, be marked as D. NZ246.  And I've also provided the translation into English, but it is one from our Defence team rather than from the translation section.  So I think, perhaps, we can wait for the official translation before admitting the English version.  So, I would ask that this be D. NZ246, solely, at this point under seal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D.NZ246 admitted, under seal) 
MR. WEBSTER: 
And this is the Kinyarwanda text.  I believe Mr. Robinson identified it as being French, but it is Kinyarwanda. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
That is correct, I'm sorry, it is Kinyarwanda.  I'm sorry. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, I want to ask you now whether or not on the *************************you appeared before a man named********************************************************************************************************, an officer of the prosecution department assigned to the court of first instance in Ruhengeri; did you appear before that gentleman and answer his questions on the******************? 
A.	I know that I was summoned by the deputy to the prosecutor, but I cannot remember the exact date. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I could show the witness the Kinyarwanda document, but, perhaps, it would be easier if I didn't deal with the date and just dealt with the substance.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, let me ask you whether or not you recall when you were questioned by the Prosecutor authorities, you denied having any knowledge of court of appeals killings.  
A.	Indeed, I initially denied everything.  I had to deny everything because I did not want to be indicted. 
Q.	And this record of interview indicates that you were asked:  "What can you say to prove that you did not go and kill people at the court of appeal?"  And I'm reading from the bottom of page 1 now on to the top of page 2.  And he said:  "There are some people that even saw you board a vehicle," to which you responded, "You are free to investigate in the place where I come from, in our cellule, and interview that ************************************************************************************************, who at the time were with me in the cellule."  And then you went on to tell them that they should ask****************** ******************************************************************.  

Now, when you gave them those names, had you made an agreement with those people beforehand that they would help you get out of prison by lying for you? 
A.	I have given those people's names because I knew full well that they would not betray me.  You have to understand that one of those two people is my uncle, and the two others are half brothers.  So, in order to clear my name, one of those people came and saw me when I was in prison.  I asked him to go and speak to the others so as to help me get out of that situation. 
Q.	So, would you agree that not only did you make false statements to the authorities, but you conspired with other people to make false statements to the authorities as well? 
A.	Counsel, since I am telling you that I was trying to clear myself out of the situation -- 
Q.	I understand that, but I want -- it is important for the Trial Chamber to know the lengths to which you would go to do that.  So would you agree that you conspired with these other people so that all of you could tell false stories to the authorities? 
A.	I told you that when I was speaking to my half brother I told him that he had to help me; they had to help me for me to get out of prison.  So he had to go and talk to those people so that they could help me get out of that situation. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I would offer the ******************statement, which is number 5 in my packet, as D. NZ247A for Kinyarwanda, B for French and C for English, under seal. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ247A, D. NZ247B and D. NZ247C admitted, under seal) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness GBU, when you were arrested in your home, were you beaten by soldiers who came to arrest you? 
A.	Yes, when those soldiers came to my home, the first thing they did was to beat me up seriously before they took me to the prison. 
Q.	And then during the time that you were in prison, were you beaten by police inspectors and officers from the prosecutor's office? 
A.	When I was in the commune gaol, it was Mr. *********who beat me up.  He blamed me for killing Tutsis, and he said I would suffer the consequences for my acts. 
Q.	When you were here last time in Mr. Nzirorera's trial, you testified that you had been beaten over    2,000 times with a club, and that is on page 6 of the testimony of the 21st of April 2004; was that true? 
A.	What I am telling you is that when I was at my home, I received more than 1,000 blows of the clubs.  And when I was taken to the prison, I was beaten over 1,500 times.  
Q.	And despite all of these beatings for two years, up until your confession of the**************************, you continued to deny any involvement in the massacres, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, the next document we are going to look at, which is number 6 in my packet, is the confession of the*************************.  And I think you have testified a little bit about that already in this trial.  And you told us that it was written by Michel Niyigaba for you; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And what made you decide to make a confession in***************? 
A.	Some members of the government came to the prison and told us that whoever decided to resort to the guilty plea and confession procedure would benefit from penal relief, that is why I decided to go by the confession and guilty plea proceeding. 
Q.	That is so you would get out of prison sooner, correct? 
A.	When I prepared this document I was seeking the forgiveness of the victims, and I wanted to be at peace with myself.  It is not like I wanted to be released, that was not my objective. 
Q.	When you were questioned about this confession at our last trial on the 21st of April 2004, at page 6, you said that you started to tell the truth because you wanted to get a lesser sentence, was that true? 
A.	I did not know that I would be released or that my sentence would be lessened.  I simply wanted to have a clear conscience. 
Q.	Well, when you testified before the ICTR Trial Chamber here in this case in 2004, and you said that you started to tell the truth because you wanted to get a lesser sentence, was that testimony accurate? 
A.	When I decided to adopt the confession and guilty plea procedure, I wanted my sentence to be lessened.  So to answer your question, what I said on that date was correct. 
Q.	Okay, thank you, Witness GBU.  Now, in the second paragraph of your guilty plea and confession, which is directed to the public prosecution, it says:  "Sir, this request comes from the bottom of my heart."  Now, was that true or was that just some kind of sales job? 
A.	When I said it came from the bottom of my heart, I was referring to what Michel had written.  I knew that Michel had not said the truth.  But I was ready to say everything regarding what had happened. 
Q.	Looking at this document, let's see if we can determine which is truth and which is not.  The first thing you said was, "I admit going to Byangabo in the morning of the 7th of April 1994.  I found many people there discussing the death of Rukara and his elder brother, which had just occurred.  Now, was that true when you got to Byangabo, had Rukira and his elder brother already been killed? 
A.	No, they had not yet been killed. 
Q.	So, why did you make a false statement about that in your confession? 
A.	But the person who wrote that is the one who committed the crime, namely, Michel Niyigaba. 
Q.	So, is it your testimony that you were trying to protect him when you said that you arrived after Rukara had been killed? 
A.	Counsel, honestly, I don't understand you when you say I was seeking to protect that person. 
Q.	I'm trying to understand why you said in your confession that Rukara had already been killed when you arrived in Byangabo; why did you say that? 
A.	The person who wrote down this document is the one who committed that crime.  I'm not the one who told him to mention that when I arrived at Byangabo, Rukara had already been killed. 
Q.	But what confuses me is that the next sentence of your confession says Rukara was killed by       Michel Niyigaba.  So what was the point of extricating yourself from being a witness to the death of Rukara if in the very next sentence you said that Rukara was killed by Michel Niyigaba? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry, but from what I recall of the witness's last response, he did not say what is indicated on the document is what he said.  In fact, he said that the document was written by Niyigaba and he didn't know the content.  So to suggest to him now that there is a contradiction is not being fair to the witness, because the witness has not acknowledged making that statement. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Well, Witness GBU, did you, in fact, include in your confession the statement that you had found many people there discussing the death of Rukara and his elder brother, which had just occurred?  Was that included in your statement? 
A.	No, that is not what I said.  It was what Michel wrote down. 
Q.	Now, it goes on to say that:  "A soldier arrived immediately and asked 'are you still here or have you finished?  Don't you know where the enemy is?'"  Did that really happen; is that true? 
A.	When Michel Niyigaba wrote this guilty plea, he simply wanted it to corroborate what he had said so that it would be considered as being the truth.  I am not the one who told him to write down the issues you are raising now. 
Q.	Now, you have told us that he read the statement back to you, correct? 
A.	Yes, he read the document, and I made him understand that what he wrote down was not what I had told him.  And his answer was that he wanted my guilty plea to be consonant (sic) with his. 
Q.	And did you agree to do that? 
A.	Given that he said he wanted my guilty plea to be consistent with his own, I did not oppose that.  I signed the document, and the document was sent to the prosecution department.  And he even asked me not to show that document to anyone whatsoever for it to be read out to me, so I immediately went to hand the document over. 
Q.	So, even when you made your confession it wasn't true, was it? 
A.	This guilty plea was not complete. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I would ask that the guilty plea document, which is number 6 in my packet, be admitted under seal as D. NZ248, A for the French and B for the English. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ248A and D. NZ248B admitted, under seal)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GBU, the next document that we have in your file is a confession and request to the -- and request for forgiveness to the state that was submitted by you just eight days later, on the                         *******************************.  Do you recall having submitted a second confession and request for forgiveness on the ***********************in which you listed a lot of names of people who collaborated with you in the attack in Rudatinya's house?  And Rudtinya is number 78 on the spelling list.  
A.	Yes, this is the document written by Michel. 
Q.	So Michel Niyigaba wrote two documents for you as part of your confession? 
A.	No, only one. 
Q.	Now, in this document it is indicated -- there are a lot of people who are listed as having collaborated with you in the attack launched against Rudatinya's house; it starts with Dusabimana, Musafiri, and there are some 29 names.  And I noticed that it did not include the name of Alexis Rukundo, and I'm wondering if you could tell us if you were trying to protect Alexis Rukundo during this process, so that he would be able to be free? 
A.	I did not try to protect Alexis Rukundo.  I mentioned him, but at that time he was actually a driver. 
Q.	Did Rukundo -- was he among those who were present during the attack against Rudatinya's house? 
A.	Yes, I think he was there. 
Q.	And do you have any explanation for why his name does not appear among the 29 people who you have listed? 
A.	Perhaps I forgot to mention his name. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I would ask that the document, number 7 in my packet of exhibits, the guilty plea of the 10th of February 1999, be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ249, A for Kinyarwanda, B for French and C for English, under seal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ249A, D. NZ249B and D. NZ249C admitted, under seal)
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, before I go on to the next document, would you like to take your break at this time?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, this is convenient. 

We will take the mid-afternoon recess now. 
(Court recessed at 1530H)
(Pages 36 to 50 by Donna M. Lewis)























(Court resumed at 1555H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  You may continue, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GBU, I'm going to ask you about the next document in our series, which is number 8 in the packet.  And it is a record and transcription of the time that you made a confession and a plea of guilty on the ************************before a woman by the name of Gaudence -- that's G-A-U-D-E-N-C-E -- Mukebwamanzi -- M-U-K-E-B-W-A-M-A-N-Z-I -- at the Ruhengeri tribunal of the first instance.  Do you recall that after you had submit -- submitted the documents written for you by Michel Niyigaba that you were brought to a woman from the Prosecution department who questioned you about your confession? 
A.	I remember that I was, indeed, asked to appear before that person.  
Q.	And they wrote down the answers to the questions that they'd asked you, and the first question they'd asked you was to give the names of your co-perpetrators, those who were currently in prison and those who were at large.  And the ones that you -- the names that you gave of those who were in prison were ******************************************************************************************************************** *****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************. 

Now, can you tell us, first of all, did you have some conscious effort to avoid incriminating some people who were with you in prison? 
A.	To my mind, I do not believe that you have mentioned all the names.  I believe that I mentioned names in that confession.  
Q.	I've read out all the names that were listed as people who were currently in prison, and then there were a number of names that you gave for people who are at large, which I have not read.  But my question to you is whether or not you were trying to protect any people who had not yet confessed in the prison.  
A.	No, I did not intend to protect anyone.  
Q.	And can -- do you have any explanation for why you didn't mention Alexis Rukundo among the co-perpetrators that were in prison? 
A.	I mentioned Rukundo's name before the judges.  I don't know whether that name was, indeed, mentioned because what I said was not read to me.  
Q.	Well, we don't have it listed here, so that's as far as I can take it.  

Now, also in this questioning and answer in**************************, you were asked what was the name of the person you killed, and you gave the name **************-- which is number 36 on the spelling list.  And then you were asked, "Who else did you kill?"  And you said, "That is the only person I killed."  

And I note that in this confession you made no mention of participating in the killing of the Tutsi who you encountered and turned over to the CDR lady with his two children, and you made no mention of participating in the killing of some 300 Tutsis at the court of appeal, and you made no mention of the killing of*********************, also in Ruhengeri town, after the court of appeals.  Can you tell us why you didn't -- since you were wanting to make a full confession, why didn't you mention having participated in those acts? 
A.	Regarding the events at the court of appeal, I gave explanations in the Prosecution department.  Regarding the incident concerning ****************(sic) children, I said that I met them after slaughtering the cow, which had been referred to previously.  Now you are saying that there is no mention of the fact that I killed*************, but I could not say that I had killed her, whereas she had been killed by Noel. 
Q.	How old were the children that you tied up on the 7th of April and delivered to the woman known as CDR? 
A.	They were very young.  In fact, too young.  
Q.	Can you tell us, were they younger than primary school age? 
A.	Perhaps they were in second or third year of primary school at that time. 
Q.	And was it a boy or a girl?  Or, what was the sex of the children? 
A.	They were two young boys and that man. 
Q.	And so you tied up those boys and you took them to the house and you stood there while they were killed, correct? 
A.	They were killed there and then with the use of small, used hoes.  After that, I left. 
Q.	And would you agree that you are responsible for their deaths, among the others? 
A.	Yes, I acknowledge my responsibility.  That is why I made it known to the Rwandan state, and I begged the forgiveness of the Rwandan state for that.  Initially ************had asked me not to mention it, but subsequently I decided to mention my role in it. 
Q.	And how did you feel when you were standing there watching these children hacked to death? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Sorry, I object to that question.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I'm -- I'm going into the sincerity of the various confessions and statements he's made to the authorities.  He keeps telling them that these are from the bottom of his heart, but he seems to neglect to mention some important events, including a very horrific murder of two children. 
MR. WEBSTER:
How he felt when he made a confession is one thing.  How he felt in the moment of the crime is quite another.  And I don't -- and my suggestion to the Court is that the latter question is not relevant and it should not be put to the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  Mr. Robinson, it is not necessary to go into his feelings -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- to make your point on credibility. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GBU, there were children inside the court of appeals when you participated in the attack, correct? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  There were women carrying their children on their backs.  They were also their parents. 
Q.	And did you hate Tutsis so much that you were willing to kill children? 
A.	This is what you should remember:  Kajelijeli had told us, "You should go and kill those Tutsis, even the fetuses who are still in their mother's bellies."  So I did not have any modicum of mercy or pity for those people because those officials had given us the orders. 
Q.	And was it your intention to carry out the orders of Kajelijeli no matter how bad those orders might have been? 
A.	Well, as I told you, Nzirorera came, gave orders.  We implemented the orders, and we brought back to him the flags which he wanted to get.  Now, regarding Kajelijeli's orders, we implemented the orders, but I did not know where those orders had come from.  
Q.	But is that how you take responsibility for the killing of small children, to say that you were simply following orders? 
A.	Counsel, at that time I was not being prosecuted by anybody.  Now, when you are going to kill those children, since I knew that I was not being prosecuted and since I had been given orders, I had to kill them.  I couldn't spare them.  
Q.	And when you were asked about the killings that you participated in during the genocide, your response has -- has consistently been that you were following orders, correct? 
A.	Absolutely. 
Q.	And do you think that that's taking a full measure of responsibility for what you, yourself, were responsible for? 
A.	What I am saying is as follows:  You give me a sword to go and attack someone.  When I come back, I will brief the person who had given me the sword to go and kill.  If he doesn't punish me, he doesn't sanction me, then you should understand that the one who gave me the order has a responsibility. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would ask that the record and transcript of the confession and plea of guilty on the***************************, which is number 8 in my packet, be admitted under seal as 
Exhibit D. NZ250.  And for this document we have French, which would be A; and English, B; and Kinyarwanda, C. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ250A, D. NZ250B, and D. NZ250C admitted, under seal) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness GBU, the next event that we have in our chronology is an interview that you gave with the Office of the Prosecutor on the ********************at the prison in Ruhengeri.  Do you recall the Prosecutors coming -- or, the investigators for the Office of the Prosecutor coming to talk to you at that time? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	And did you tell them the truth? 
A.	I told them the truth.  But when they came back, they read out to me the statement I had given, and I realised that there were certain mistakes in it.  So I asked them to delete certain portions of that statement.  
Q.	And did they do that? 
A.	Those mistakes were not corrected.  
Q.	But it's your testimony at this trial that the investigators read the statement back to you, and -- after the interview they read the statement back to you; is that correct? 
A.	They wrote down my statement and went and typed the statement in Kigali.  When they came back, I realised that there are -- made some additions; some words which I had not mentioned were added.  ********of us had been interviewed.  Michel Niyigaba was also interviewed.  He said that in his interview he had mentioned all names excepting Kajelijeli and Nzirorera. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the Kinyarwanda interpreters say they have lost the witness.  If he could repeat what he said. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you're speaking too fast for the interpreters to interpret everything you say.  So, please, you have to repeat what you said and slow down.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I thank you.  

The investigators of the Prosecutor came to interview us as part of the investigations, which investigations concerned Kajelijeli, Nzirorera, Bizimungu, and Setako.  We were********************** **************************************************************************************************************************************; and myself.  

The first person to be interviewed was Michel Niyigaba.  When he was asked questions regarding those people, he said he knew nothing about them.  When he came out, he told us that investigations were being conducted on those officials whose names I had mentioned and that we were to say nothing about them.  

So, it was my turn.  I was summoned.  When I went inside, I answered their questions.  My answers were recorded in writing.  They were taking down handwritten notes.  Thereafter, they went and typed my statement in Kigali.  When they came back, my statement was read out to me so that I could sign it, which is what I did.  Thereafter, I told them that there were certain statements ascribed to me, which statements I had not made.  So they told me that they would be back.  Then I told them that it was not necessary for them to come back because I could sign the statement.  But at once they returned, they had to delete those statements which had been ascribed to me.  

Why did I tell them that?  You see, ***********had prevented me from saying anything regarding those officials.  Yet, at that time infiltrators were attacking from the Congo.  So I was concerned because I thought those infiltrators could also attack my family.  You see, I did not want Michel to know that I had given a statement to the international criminal tribunal because he had forbidden me from doing so. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GBU, your testimony that the investigator read the statement back to you and you asked him to make corrections is completely at odds with your testimony that you gave in this trial on the 
	21st of April 2004, in which you said at no time was this statement ever read to you after the interview of the*******************.  Can you explain that?  And that's at page 4 of the transcript.  
A.	Well, I put it that way because this statement was shown to me during my testimony, and I said that those people did not subsequently come back to me to read out my statement to me for me to ascertain that the portions which had to be deleted had, indeed, been deleted.  
Q.	Now, did you tell the truth to the investigators when they interviewed you on the*******************? 
A.	Yes, I told them the truth, save for certain errors which I had spotted but which were not deleted from the statement. 
Q.	And did you tell them about Kajelijeli, or did you say nothing about Kajelijeli? 
A.	No, I told them about Kajelijeli. 
Q.	Now, let's look at some of the things that you told them about Kajelijeli.  In your statement you talked about hearing the news of President Habyarimana's death on RTLM radio during the night of 6th April and that the next day you defied the radio communiqués "forbidding us from leaving our homes.  And I went to the market to find out if I could work.  **********************************." 
Was that true?  Did you go on the morning of the 7th to Byangabo to find out if you could work? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	But didn't you just testify this -- today that you went to Byangabo because you expected you would be needed to kill Tutsis? 
A.	You should remember that I first told you that I went to Byangabo to see whether we would be given some work to do.  But once we were called from the house which had been placed at our disposal by Nzirorera, it was at that time that we were told to go and kill Tutsis.  
Q.	So when you left your house that morning of the 7th, were you intending to *******************at the market or intending to kill Tutsis, when you left your house? 
A.	Given that around that time Tutsis were being hunted down, because we had been told that, indeed, they were the bad guys, well, that day I did not think that I was going to carry out my routine duties as a **********. 
Q.	Now, your statement goes on to say that "I met Kajelijeli there at Byangabo market.  He was with Bambonye, Karorero, and Nyabusore, the director of ISAE.  They summoned the MRND youth."  

Is that correct?  Is that what happened? 
A.	Kajelijeli was accompanied by Bambonye.  They were returning from a meeting which had taken place in the home of Nzirorera's mother. 
Q.	And you, yourself, never went to Nzirorera's mother's house that day, correct? 
A.	I did not tell you that I was at Nzirorera's mother's home.  I said I was in the house which had been placed at our disposal by Nzirorera.  That is where the Interahamwe were working. 
Q.	Now, you went on to say in this statement, "Although I was not a member of the MRND youth wing, I decided to remain with the group."  

Was that true? 
A.	No, that is not what I told them.  I told them I was a member of the -- of the Interahamwe, which was the youth wing of the MRND.  It was, indeed, for this reason that I told you there were certain parts of my statement which had been omitted, and in certain areas of my statements what I said had been mixed up.  
Q.	Now, the next thing that you are quoted as saying is that "We went into Kajelijeli's house."  

Was that true? 
A.	Yes, in Kajelijeli's bar. 
Q.	You went inside the bar? 
A.	Yes, inside the bar.  The others were outside that bar.  
Q.	But you were inside? 
A.	Yes, we were inside.  
Q.	Now, the statement that "We had to take revenge.  Tutsis are to be exterminated, including those in their mother's womb," when you testified at Kajelijeli's trial, you testified that that statement was made by Kajelijeli.  But in your statement of the*********************, you say the statement was made by Bambonye -- that's number 7 on the spelling list -- which was it? 
A.	No, Kajelijeli was the one to say that, but Bambonye repeated the same thing.  However, it was Kajelijeli who initially quoted those words. 
Q.	So as you were in Kajelijeli's bar, are you telling us that Kajelijeli said, "You have to take revenge and exterminate the Tutsis, including those in the mother's womb," and then Bambonye said, "You have to take revenge and exterminate the Tutsis, including those in the mother's womb."  

Was that how they were talking that day, like parrots? 
A.	You know, Kajelijeli said the following:  He said, "Kill those people, including those in their mother's wombs."  And Bambonye repeated, "Yes, kill those, including those in their mother's wombs." 
Q.	Now, you went on to say that after the meeting you had gone to the houses of the Tutsis in your secteur and that you had left without weapons, but later Kajelijeli sent a pickup truck carrying weapons to the home of Buhire, B-U-H-I-R-E, the responsable of the cellule for Busogo.  "We unloaded the weapons, and Kalashnikovs were distributed to those who had received the training."  

Was that true? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And you tell us that you have received training by the 7th of April 1994, correct? 
A.	That is correct.  I had already received training.  
Q.	And was a Kalashnikov distributed to you? 
A.	No.  I was given grenades.  
Q.	And it says here that "Personally, I had brought a cudgel from home."  

Was that correct? 
A.	Yes, I did indeed have a cudgel. 
Q.	And at the time of that first page of the statement, it goes on to talk about the meeting in 1993 that President Habyarimana held at the stadium in Ruhengeri.  You're recorded as having told the investigators that "He told the people that day that the day he died they should avenge him."  

Did President Habyarimana say that in Ruhengeri at the stadium? 
A.	This is what President Habyarimana said:  He said that when he came to be killed, the Interahamwe should avenge him.  And he was standing there in the presence of the Interahamwe. 
Q.	And you heard that yourself? 
A.	Yes, I was there.  
Q.	Well, Witness GBU, I will represent to you that there is in evidence produced by the Prosecution a complete videotape of the Ruhengeri meeting of the 15th of November 1992, and nowhere in the speech of President Habyarimana does he ever say anything about people avenging him after he died.  What do you have to say to that? 
A.	I would like to say that I heard him say with my own ears that he would be killed, and he said that the Interahamwe should avenge him, that is, that they should be -- that they should be killed with him.  
Q.	Witness GBU, if you were a judge, what would you believe, a videotape of the speech or the testimony of someone like you? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Sorry, I object to that question, on two grounds, actually.  On the most obvious grounds, I'm not even going to go into.  But, you know, I've made similar comments before.  Mr. Robinson refers frequently to this tape as if it's a complete record of what transpired in Ruhengeri, and I've always responded that we have never adopted that position.  The tape is -- the tape speaks for itself.  Nowhere on the tape, or coming from the Prosecution side, is there a representation that everything that Habyarimana did or said is recorded on tape.  

So I think the questions should be put to a -- to the witness in a way that lays additional foundation, if he wants to -- if Mr. Robinson wants to suggest that the only words that Habyarimana spoke are those that are recorded on the tape.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, is it the Prosecution's case that President Habyarimana said that his death should be avenged if he died?  If that's their case, then we can meet that case.  But if it's not, then I think Mr. Webster ought to be a little more forthright.  Because you see on that tape the president arriving.  You see him speaking.  You see him leaving.  And it's incongruous to me to suggest, as a responsible officer of the Court, that somehow that that can be reconciled with the testimony of this witness.  So is that the case that we have to meet, that President Habyarimana on the 15th of November 1992 said that he -- if he died that the Interahamwe should avenge his death?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry, Mr. Robinson asked a question of the witness.  The witness responded, and we simply have to deal with his evidence.  If the Defence wants to challenge the witness, it can do so, but it's not the Prosecution position of every -- you know, it's not our case to describe everything that was said on that day by President Habyarimana.  

In this trial we've already had testimony from another witness who gave evidence of other things that were being said, not by Habyarimana but by Ngirumpatse.  So the issue is the same.  There's no representation that the tape captures everything that was said by every person that participated in that event.  And I think if the Court looks at the tape, we'll all observe that there are cuts in the tape. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Webster, that's a matter on which evidence has to be given.  We will be paying attention to the evidence in due course. 
MR. WEBSTER:
All right. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, there's no point making closing arguments at this stage.  

And the real question -- the real point, Mr. Robinson, is you can't really expect the witness to put himself in our position.  So the question really could not be asked in the way you asked it.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GBU, going back to your statement of the *******************about the Ruhengeri meeting, you said that at the meeting Préfet Basile started to sensitise the youths by reiterating the president's earlier message.  Was that true? 
A.	Yes, when he spoke, he addressed the youth movement with a view to sensitising them to the fact that there were Interahamwe who would meet at Ruhengeri.  And that is what he said when he got up to speak.  
Q.	Well, you see, Witness GBU, first of all, we have, again on the videotape, Basile is nowhere ever seen.  Secondly, I represent to you that Basile was a member of the MDR party and would not have attended a rally of the MRND party.  And, third, I represent to you that Basile was not even made the préfet of Ruhengeri until the 17th of April 1994 after the genocide had started.  Now, would you like to comment on that? 
A.	I am talking to you as somebody who was in Ruhengeri.  When you start to make such comments, I wonder what you are basing your affirmations upon, in view of the fact that you were not in Ruhengeri during that period. 
Q.	Well, Witness GBU, let's just start with something I think is simple.  I'd like to have document called -- the parties' attention to document number 30 in a supplemental exhibit packet that I provided this morning.  I don't know if that's been distributed yet, but, if it hasn't been, perhaps it can be.  Or if it has been, if you could direct your attention to number 30.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And, Mr. President, I would represent that this is a radio broadcast of the 18th of April 1994.  And with the permission of the Trial Chamber, I would like to have my legal assistant read a brief portion of this broadcast to the witness and get his comment.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, could you give a little bit more information?  It's a broadcast from which radio?  
MR. ROBINSON:
It's a broadcast from Radio Rwanda. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Radio Rwanda, uh-huh. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I assume we're going to hear something in Kinyarwanda, but I don't have the -- the additional disclosure.  And if that could be made available to me, I'd appreciate it. 
MR. ROBINSON:
If Mr. Issa could make those exhibits available to everyone, I'd appreciate that.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, the document was indeed distributed to us.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And, Mr. President, I am proposing to have my assistant read the last paragraph on the page that ends in the K -- the 578.  And just -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
On your list it's number -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thirty. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thirty.  
MR. ROBINSON:
So, Witness GBU, we're going to read to you something in Kinyarwanda that was broadcast on Radio Rwanda on the 18th of April 1994, and I'd like you to listen to that, and then I'm going to ask you a question about it.  
MR. NSENGIYUMVA:
"Communiqué on the part of the Rwandan government:  This day, the 17th of the month of the year 1994, the council of ministers convened a meeting chaired by the prime minister, his excellency, 
Jean Kambanda, and on the agenda was the problem to do with the administration of the country.  The council of ministers noted that in such a difficult situation préfets should be appointed to those préfectures that do not have any, that is, Kigali, Byumba, Ruhengeri, and Gisenyi.  

"After listening to the suggestions of the various party representatives, part of the government, the government then decided to appoint the following to the post of préfet:  To Kigali, François Karera was appointed to Byumba préfecture; Elias Nyirimbibi, to Ruhengeri; Monsieur Basile Nsabyumugisha; and Charles Zirimwabagabo was appointed préfet to Gisenyi préfecture."  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And maybe those names should be spelt.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you.  

François Karera, spelled K-A-R-E-R-A; Elias Nyirimbibi, N-Y-I-R-I-M-B-I-B-I; Basile, B-A-S-I-L-L-E (sic); Nsabyumugisha, N-S-A-B-Y-U-M-U-G-I-S-H-A; and Charles Zirimwabagabo, Z-I-R-I-M-W-A-B-A-G-A-B-O.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, having just heard, Witness GBU, a portion of a broadcast in April 1994 on Radio Rwanda, do you still maintain that Basile was the préfet in Ruhengeri at the time of President Habyarimana's speech in 1992? 
A.	I would like to say that, in fact, the préfet and the sous-préfet were at the same level.  Why was it that Kambanda appointed him to the post of préfet?  I know very well that Kambanda had distributed weapons for the Tutsi to be killed.  So why was it that he came to decide to appoint Basile to the post of préfet of Ruhengeri?  It was because there were interests in play.  You said it was because he was a member of the MDR party.  Did you come across this piece of information in the excerpt that we have just read from?  
Q.	No, Witness, there's nothing in the excerpt about identifying which party he's from.  But it does make it clear that he's being appointed in April 1994, and, therefore, he could not be the préfet in 1992.  Would you agree with that? 
A.	Counsel, I would like to request that you tell me where you gleaned that information, i.e., that that person was a member of the MDR party.  Where did you obtain that information from?  
Q.	Well, Witness GBU, for your information, I obtained that directly from Basile in the prison in Ruhengeri.  
A.	That is why I told you that the officials did not actually admit to be guilty of the crimes that were committed in 1994.  He will not admit to guilt for those crimes.  
Q.	And so you're telling me that he was an MRND member but now he's pretending to be MDR so that he wouldn't be held responsible?  Is that what you're saying? 
A.	Counsel, listen carefully to what I'm saying to you.  What I am saying is that the officials that you are defending do not want to admit guilt for the crimes that they have committed.  They always try to dissociate themselves from the party that they had joined in order to say that they were members of the MDR and rid themselves of responsibility.  I know that he was a member of the MDR party.  Are you saying that Kambanda, like the other officials, was a member of the MDR?  Well, when he appointed Basile to that post, he wanted to appoint somebody who had already and always collaborated with him.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would ask that the excerpt of the broadcast of the 18th of April 1994 be admitted as D. NZ251. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ251 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, going back to your statement of the ***************-- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Sorry to interrupt, but just a point of clarification.  At some point back, and I'm just addressing this as a matter of -- of procedure, the Court expressed some concern about the proliferation of documents in our record.  And I'd like to use this as an example, because Mr. Robinson had us listen to the portion of the transcript that he found to be probative, or interesting, for this case.  It's on the record.  It was read into the record.  What is the point now of putting in the entire broadcast?  

I'm not opposing it, per se.  I don't know what's in it because it's all in Kinyarwanda, and it goes on for at least five or six pages.  But just as a -- on the issue of procedure, how should we conduct ourselves?  We've only heard one paragraph of a six-page transcript, and I don't even know what's in the remainder of the transcript.  So wouldn't it be more efficient simply to rely on the record, since we have it in French and English, which the Court understands and the parties understand and nobody understands, other than the Accused, the Kinyarwanda text, which is what we have as an exhibit here? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We had made an arrangement with the language unit for the translation of documents which are -- will be required for our deliberations.  I presume that that would also require the establishment of (unintelligible).  

You know, I would have thought that from your perspective it would have been more interesting for the context to be analysed (inaudible) just being on the record rather than just have one paragraph of it. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm not objecting to it, Your Honour.  I'm simply bringing it to the Court's attention because I'm also concerned about the proliferation of documents on the record.  And this is a seven-page document that we would have to translate in order to get the one paragraph that Mr. Robinson is interested in.  So I'm not opposing it, but I'm bringing it to the Court's attention so that we can do things in a way that's efficient.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I don't mind if they just want to admit the one paragraph that was read as part of the exhibit, but I'm trying to produce these exhibits as a whole as opposed to cutting and pasting them.  I think that's a fairer way to proceed.  But if Mr. Webster wants to simply admit a portion of the exhibit, I don't have any problem with that.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness GBU, now I want to ask you about something else in that -- that was in your statement of the********************.  And you're talking about the training, and you said that "Kajelijeli often -- often observed our training exercises and would extort -- exhort us --" that's E-X-H-O-R-T -- "saying, 'Train quickly so you can go to the front.'"  

Was that true? 
A.	Kajelijeli was in the company of the chief warrant officer, Karorero, and another gentleman.  And he said that they would have to go through a training exercise that was called civilian defence.  I'm not a specialist of training, but when one talks of civilian defence, I understand that one is going about defending members of the population.  So we were told that such training was necessary and that then people should go to the front.  I know that those who did go into the front received military training in military camps and not at the (French spoken) of the commune, the commune headquarters. 
Q.	Was it your understanding that the purpose of the training that you were undergoing was to prepare you to go to the front if that was necessary? 
A.	I thought that we were being provided with the military training in order to be able to exterminate an ethnic group because, when I analyse everything that was said to us when we were called and told to go and exterminate the Tutsis, I noted that this also went hand in hand with the training that we were given during that period.  And during that period we did not have uniforms.  We were not soldiers, and so we could not be expected to go to the front.  
(Pages 51 to 63 by Ann Burum)




















1700H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So was it your testimony that while you were being trained you believed that the Interahamwe were being trained to kill Tutsis?  
A.	When we were provided with that training, I knew only too well that it was with a view to killing Tutsis, but at the time we were asked to go and kill Tutsis and that was -- that is what we did.  
Q.	Witness GBU, that's the complete opposite of testimony that you gave in this very same trial on the 20th of April 2004 at page 42 and again, the next day, on the 21st of April 2004 at page 7, when you testified that it was on the morning of the 7th of April 1994 that you first learned that the Interahamwe had been trained to kill Tutsis.  Now, can you explain to us why you're giving testimony that is completely contradictory to itself? 
A.	Are you saying that on the 7th of April I gave training for Tutsis to be killed?  Well, I didn't quite understand your question.  Kindly repeat it, sir. 
Q.	Okay.  I'm -- I'm sorry about that.  This is my question:  Today you're telling us that while you were being trained, you knew that you were being trained to kill Tutsis.  But when you testified in the very same trial two years ago, you said that you didn't know that you were being trained to kill Tutsis and that you only learned about the killing of Tutsis on the 7th of April when you were asked to kill them.  So can you tell us how you -- how you can give two completely contradictory statements about the same thing? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Before the witness answers, could I have the reference for the transcript on the 20th of April, please?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
It's page 42.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
And I will look at page 42, but when I looked at the transcript on the 21st, my reading of that transcript is not -- does not conform to the way the question is being put to the witness.  I'll look at the next -- the other page and see, but I would ask Mr. Robinson to reconsider how he is phrasing the question.
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I think I'll just take a minute and I'll call up the page of the transcript so I can be exactly accurate. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
And we have three pairs of the eyes looking for the reference on page 43, and none of us can find it for the transcripts on -- of the 20th.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I did find it.  It's at page 41.  I'm sorry.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And on line 30 I asked you, "So was it on the morning of 7 of April 1994 that you first learned that the Interahamwe were trained to kill Tutsis?"  And your answer was, "Yes, quite so."  So having now heard the question and the answer, can you explain to us why you've given testimony today that is the opposite of what you said in 2004? 
A.	Please remember the way you put the question to me.  You asked me as follows:  "What, according to you, was the objective of the military training?"  I wonder if you will remember the question.  Now, when I think over things, I understand that I was trained to kill Tutsis, and I also told you about the civil defence programme, which was a system designed to protect the population.  Well, we did not protect the population.  
Q.	Witness GBU, at the time you were undergoing the training prior to the 7th of April 1994, did you believe that you were being trained to exterminate the Tutsis or did you believe that you were being trained to go to the front?  
A.	I told you that when we were being trained, we were told that it was part of a civil defence drive.  I really don't know whether you understand what I'm saying.  Now, that much talked about civil defence did not protect the population.  Rather, it was a contrary.  It was what was referred to at the time as 
	Virunga Force.  Well, the civil defence did not protect the population as it was being said.  Rather, in connection with that programme, people were killed.  

Now, when I was being trained, when I was being taught weapons handling, I was not told that I would be going to the front.  At the end of the training, I was told that I would be protecting the population. 
Q.	In your statement of the 7th of May 1999 you state Kajelijeli often observed our training exercises and would exhort us saying, "Train quickly so you can go to the front."  Was that what was said at the time?  
A.	I would like to make this request to the president.  Regarding the events of 1990 and 1992, I cannot remember them.  They happened a long time ago.  Well, as for Mr. Robinson, he has all the literature at his disposal.  He spends the whole night consulting the literature.  Now, when I say Kajelijeli asked us to go and receive training, very rapidly, we thought we would join the army, but that did not happen.  
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness GBU.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I would offer the witness statement from the Office of the Prosecutor dated the *****************as Exhibit D. NZ252, A for the French and B for the English, under seal.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ252A and D. NZ252B admitted, under seal) 

MR. WEBSTER: 
Are we also going to be exhibiting the two pages from the previous trial transcript, the page 41 from the 20th of April and page 7 from the 21st of April?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Actually, Mr. President, I was planning on going back when I have some time and collecting the inconsistent statements that are being in the transcripts, so I was going to offer those, but I'm not -- I don't have hard copies here now to do that.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness GBU, while I was staying up all night last night, I dug out a statement of the 
	*******************that you made to an Appolinaire Kiyatavu -- that's A-P-P-O-L-I-N-A-I-R-E, and then Kiyatavu is K-I-Y-A-T-A-V-U -- a member of the prosecution department of the Ruhengeri tribunal of first instance.  And this was a proceeding which took place on the ******************in which they were questioning you about your confession, and they recorded your answers to the questions and then you put your signature.  Do you recall that? 
A.	I don't remember that.  It happened a long time ago, so I can't remember that. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I'm going to ask if the Kinyarwanda record of -- this is exhibit number 10 in my bundle, can be shown to the witness.  

If you could show him the very last page, and there's a name written above the -- above the -- there's a signature and a name written above the signature and then above that there's another name written.  I wonder if you could point that out to him and see if he could understand. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GBU, what's been handed to you is a document in Kinyarwandan concerning an appearance of a person with your name on the **********************before the prosecution department in Ruhengeri, and it lists the names of your parents and the year of your birth and then it goes on and asks some questions and answers.  And then on the very last page there's your name and then underneath that is the signature of the person taking your statement.  And on the other pages there are some thumbprints that were affixed to the document.  So, looking at that document, are you able to tell us whether or not that's a record of a document that pertains to you?  
A.	You are doing that deliberately, Counsel.  I have told you I don't know how to read, I don't know how to write.  Now, when you show me documents without asking someone who knows how to read to assist me, I don't really know what you are up to. 
Q.	Okay.  Let's see if we could get Mr. Issa to assist you.  If Mr. Issa could come over to me and I'll show him the place where he can point to the witness.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
On the very last page, if you could direct his attention to that line.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness GBU, did you see your name at the place that was pointed out to you by the registry? 
A.	He has shown me a name below which name there is a signature, and further above there is a typed sentence. 
Q.	And are you able to recognise your name on that document? 
A.	Yes, on top of the signature. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I would offer what's been exhibit -- number 10 in my packet as 
Exhibit D. NZ253, A for French, B for English, and C for Kinyarwanda.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  Is this to be under seal?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ253A, D. NZ253B and D. NZ253C admitted, under seal) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness GBU, during this confession procedure in****************************, did you still intend to tell the whole truth about what you had done?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And anywhere in this confession did you mention your participation in the murders of the two children and the person who you delivered to the woman named CDR? 
A.	Well, if you want to put questions to me regarding this document, unless you read out any of the portions which you are interested in to me, I won't be able to answer you because I am not familiar with the content of this document. 
Q.	Did you have any intention to not admit to the killing of those two children or your participation in the killing of those two children when you were making your confessions in 1999? 
A.	I have told you that if it was not mentioned in my confessions, then it was because of Michel Niyigaba, who said there was someone else who had recognised and acknowledged having murdered those people.  So he's the one who did not want to mention my responsibility in the killing of those three people. 
Q.	But in this document you were actually appearing live before a prosecutor.  It wasn't a -- you weren't writing some document that you were submitting to the authorities.  This was questions and answers.  You were by yourself.  You were not with Michel Niyigaba.  Why did you conceal your participation in the killing of those three people? 
A.	Listen, I explained this at some point in time.  I cannot remember the dates.  All what I know is that I had given explanations about this to the prosecution department, but I'm unable to give the date when I did so.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  The next document I want to ask you about is number 28 in our supplemental package of exhibits.  And it's a record of proceedings on the ******************* before the chamber of conseil in which a large number of people were brought before them and asked whether or not they wished to make confessions or to plead not guilty.  And according to this document, on 
	page K0377067, you were one of the people who were brought there, along with************************* *****************************************************************.  

Now, it indicates that you were going to be providing additional confessions after that date.  Was this part of your procedure that you were going through in the Ruhengeri court to continue to provide information to them as you were going along?  Did you have the intention -- that's not a very clear question, but did you have the intention to continue to provide information to the authorities, bit by bit, as you were going along in the procedure?  
A.	Let me tell you this:  Given the time when these events occurred, it is possible that one may not remember some of the incidents.  But from the moment when I decided to resort to the guilty plea and confession procedure, I had resolved to say all what I knew. 
Q.	And is that what you told the chamber of conseil when you appeared before them in**********, that you would tell them all what you knew in the future? 
A.	You are asking me questions regarding things which I said in******.  Now, on account of the time lapse, it is difficult for me to remember those things.  Seven years is not nothing.  I cannot remember those things I said. 
Q.	Okay.  That's understandable.  Do you recall appearing with *****************-- that's number 60 on the spelling list -- *****************************-- which is number 63 on the spelling list -- and all the people who were charged in the case arising out of the killings in Busogo, do you recall appearing before the chamber of conseil with all those people and affirming that -- 
A.	I remember that appearance, but I cannot remember when it happened. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I would ask that my document number 28, which is a handwritten record in Kinyarwanda of the chairman of council proceedings on the ***********************be admitted under seal as D. NZ254.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ254 admitted, under seal) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Just before, one clarification, why is this particular exhibit coming into the record?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, actually, I'm trying to complete the chronology of all this witness's appearances before the Rwandan courts.  It's not a particularly significant document.  In the past, Mr. Webster has asked me to include documents such as not guilty pleas or guilty pleas, so I was trying to be complete.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness GBU, turning to the next document, which is number 11 in my packet, on the 
	*****************************, it's been written that you appeared again before this prosecutor 
	Appolinaire Kiyatavu Mpumuro, K-A-Y-I-T-A-V-U (sic), M-P-U-M-U-R-O, and that you were asked on the second page of this document:  "Would you know if Michel Niyigaba took part in the attack on the convent?"  And your answer was, "No, he did not.  I found him at" -- B-I-N-A-G-A -- "and everyone was saying that he had not taken part in the attack."  Was that a truthful statement on your part? 
A.	You mentioned to Binaga, but I don't know what you are referring to when you mention Binaga. 
Q.	That's the way it's written, but it's possible that it's meant to be said Byangabo.  Let's assume, just sticking to the question of whether he took part in the attack of the convent and you said no, was that true? 
A.	No, sir.  Let's understand one another.  There is a difference between Binaga and Byangabo. 
Q.	Okay, forget about Binaga and Byangabo.  The point is when you were asked if Michel Niyigaba had taken part in the attack on the convent, you said no.  Was that a true answer? 
A.	What I meant was that I could not know that he had taken part in that attack, because personally I did not participate in the attack against the convent. 
Q.	And you said, "Everybody was saying that he had not taken part in the attack."  Was that true?  After the attack in Busogo, was everybody saying that Michel Niyigaba had not taken part in that attack?  
A.	There is something I would like to know.  Regarding Michel Niyigaba's participation in the attack at Busogo, what is really the relevance of that attack?  I never said that Michel Niyigaba had gone to Busogo to kill people who had sought refuge at the convent.  I never said that.  I said the Interahamwe had gone there.  I never said Niyigaba had gone there.  Now, on what basis is Defence counsel putting that question to me?  
Q.	Well, Witness GBU, I'm suggesting to you that as of the*******************, you were still lying to the authorities in Rwanda, even though you were claiming to make full confessions to the -- from the bottom of your heart.  Do you have any comment to that?  
A.	I have nothing to tell you in that connection because at that time I had not yet mentioned *************** death, as well as the death of the two children.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, is this a convenient time?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  If I could just offer this document of the***************************, which is number 11 in my packet, as D. NZ255, A through C and under seal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ255A, D. NZ255B and D. NZ255C admitted, under seal) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Now is a convenient time, yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We take the adjournment now.  You resume your testimony tomorrow.  I am telling you, Mr. Witness, as a reminder to the information already communicated to you, that during this or any adjournment of the hearing while you are in evidence, you should not discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  

We take the adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1731H)
