MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:  
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III is now sitting in open session today, Friday, 9th September 2005, for the pre-trial conference in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al.  Thank you.   
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.

MR. ROBINSON:  
Good morning, Mr. President, members of the Trial Chamber.  I am Peter Robinson, representing Joseph Nzirorera.  I am assisted by the legal assistant Jean-Paul Temehagali, by intern Russell Hopkins, and by our new intern, who I would like to introduce to the Trial Chamber, 
Gina Mensa-Datse from Ghana.  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
This is a continuation of the pre-trial conference that we started last week.  Perhaps I can start it off by delivering three oral decisions which we thought might be important to address at this time.  

Now, the first one has to do with the Prosecutor's submission in purported compliance with our decision of 10th August 2005. Our decision is:  On the 8th of August 2005, the Chamber ordered the Prosecution to indicate which paragraphs of the 2001 indictment corresponds to paragraghs 40, 59, 63 sub paragraghs 2, 66, 68 and 69 of the amended indictment.  After reviewing the supplementary information filed by the Prosecution on 
10th August 2005, the Chamber is satisfied that a prima facie case exists with respect to paragraghs 59, 63, sub paragraghs 2, 66, 68 and 69 of the current amended indictment.  Concerning paragragh 40 of the amended indictment, the Defence for Nzirorera claimed that it is not supported by any material provided by the Prosecution and should therefore be stricken from the amended indictment, or modified to delete the allegation that Mr. Nzirorera participated in the meeting described therein.

Now, the Chamber recalls that the purpose of reviewing supporting material provided to obtain leave to amend the indictment is to ensure that the Prosecution has shown sufficient grounds to indict the Accused with the charges as amended without going into any specific evaluation of the culpability of the Accused.  In the present case, the Chamber is of the view that the objection raised by the Defence is an evidentiary matter that should be addressed at a later stage.  The Chamber is satisfied that a prima facie case has been established with respect to paragragh 40 of the amended indictment.  That concludes the first ruling we have.  

The second ruling is on the Karemera motion for extension of time filed on the 29th of July 2005, and the decision is as follows:  In a motion on 29th July 2005, the Defence for Karemera moves the Court to order that the time limit to file a reply will start running from the filing of the translation into French of all the documents in the present case.  The Chamber recalls that according to Article 20 of the Statutes of the Tribunal and established jurisprudence, the Accused is entitled to be provided with the indictment, the supporting material and all evidentiary material, which would be used in the adjudicating process in a language he understands.  There is no entitlement to have all documents in the case translated.  

In the instant proceedings, the Chamber has previously considered on a case-by-case basis, and a specific request made, whether it was appropriate to grant an extension of time for the Defence to be served with a French translation of documents.  The Chamber is of the view that other means like the interpretation in Court or the use of the bilingual resources among the Defence team may be used to guarantee and enhance the rights of the Accused.  
In the light of the rights of the Accused to understand the charges against him, but also his right to be tried without undue delay, the Chamber considers that it is not appropriate to grant an automatic extension of time as sought by the Defence in this motion, and so, the motion is therefore dismissed.  

The third ruling is on the Karemera motion for extension of time, filed on 7th September 2005.  Now, in a motion filed on 7th September 2005, the Defence for Karemera requests the Chamber to allow it to make its observations on the amended indictment only when it will be served with a French version on the Chamber's decision of 5th August 2005 on the defects in the form of the indictment.  Now, the Chamber notes that on the 31st of August 2005, the Defence was served with a French version of the amended indictment following the Chamber's decision of 5th August 2005.  Therefore, both the Defence and the Accused were in a position to examine the charges against the Accused.  The Chamber is aware of the fact that the Defence team is currently assisted by a bilingual assistant whose task is mainly to provide translation of documents.  Now, I would like to comment that it is unusual for a Chamber to hear observations and motions from the Defence after the filing of the amended indictment, pursuant to the Trial Chamber's decision.  What we have allowed here is an exceptional opportunity for the parties to do that.  We, therefore, reject the oral motion for extension of time filed by Karemera. 

Now, we have in two -- we have indicated that we will hear today submissions by Nzirorera and Ngirumpatse, and the Prosecutor, on observations regarding the amended indictment.  And in that context, we have decided to also hear Karemera, if he wishes to avail himself of the opportunity to present his observations at this time.  So during the course of this pre-trial conference, there will be an opportunity to present observations, if you wish to do so. 

I've just been reminded that the Nzirorera and Ngirumpatse have submitted their observations in writing, and so what was being allowed today was for the Prosecutor to submit his response orally.  But we would allow Karemera to present his observations orally, if you wish to do so. 

Now, the second item on our order for business was to allow the Prosecutor to present his arguments -- or present his observations with respect to the amended indictment, and in response to the Ngirumpatse motion and the Nzirorera objections that have been filed before the Chamber.  

Now, I don't know, Mr. Sow, if you wish to be heard on this item of the agenda, and if you do, whether you will like to make your observations before the Prosecutor replies.  
MR. SOW:  
Most obliged, Your Honour.  

Your Honour, of course, I would have liked to make my observations, but as we have indicated to you, we were not able to take cognisance of your decision of the 5th August 2005, which is still in English.  Let me also say that our assistant has just been informed this morning that the program of work of the assistant had been granted only for this morning, only this morning that we received this decision.  Other (inaudible) condition, it is not possible for me to raise any observation at this time, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much for that indication.  

Mr. Prosecutor, are you ready? 
MR. WEBSTER:   
Yes, we are, Your Honour.  In relation to the indictment, I'm going to ask my colleague, 
Gregory Lombardi, to take the floor and he will respond to the Defence's objections and observations.   
MR. LOMBARDI:   
Good morning.  

First, I make the observation that there were two scheduling orders issued in relation to these motions: The first in response to Ngirumpatse's motion, which required us to file a written response by yesterday, and then, a subsequent order, as you know, in response to Nzirorera's motion, that led to the oral argument here this morning.  The Prosecutor had already prepared his written response in compliance with the first order, and we filed that written response yesterday in French.   And so, unless there are particular questions from the Chamber as to that motion, we would rely upon our written response to Ngirumpatse, and this morning address orally, only Nzirorera's motion.   

As a further preliminary matter, the Prosecutor observes that the Defence has not specified under what rule it is proceeding, either Rule 72 or Rule 73 with this motion.  We would interpret this as a preliminary motion under Rule 72 for alleging further defects in the form of the indictment filed on the 24th of August.  With respect to Nzirorera's motion, he alleges, essentially two things:  One, that the Prosecutor has impermissibly added new charges to the indictment, and also that the indictment failed -- or that the indictment fails to comply with the order and that it is -- continues to be vague in certain respects and requires more specificity.  

As to the first issue, the Prosecutor submits that he has not added any new charges.  According to the Appeals Chamber in Muvunyi, a decision that Nzirorera cited in his papers, a charge is defined as "a legal provision infringed, whilst acts and omissions of the Accused had given rise to that alleged infringement are the material facts," and that it is an easy distinction to draw  Thus in that Muvunyi decision where the charge was the attack at university hospital, the Appeals Chamber held that the allegations specifying the Accused's means of participation in that attack were, in fact, material facts and not new charges.  Muvunyi found new charges where there were new events alleged in which the Accused was involved through some mode of participation.  And of the seven facts or the seven allegations of new charges in that decision, it found only two were, in fact, new charges.  The others were considered to be material facts, and one of the big distinctions in that decision was also the idea that the -- the fact that the new charges were cleared in a general section and were not linked to any particular charge in the indictment. 

So while it's true that entirely new facts or situations can be considered to be a new charge, even if the actual counts themselves are not modified.  That is not what has happened in this case.  In this case, the indictment has been amended at the direction of the Chamber in response to a motion for defect in form by adding new detail, and by further specifying material facts.  The charges have not changed at all.  There are no new allegations.  The JCE allegation remains identical.  The purpose of the joint criminal enterprise is the same, the means by which the Accused participated in that joint criminal enterprise is the same, and, as are the charges: conspiracy to commit genocide, directing public incitement to commit genocide, et cetera.  There is no change there.  What has been modified at the Trial Chamber's direction are the individuals through which the Accused either co-participated in the joint criminal enterprise at paragragh 6, and their subordinates in paragragh 18.  Under Muvunyi, the Prosecutor submits that these additions do not amount to new charges, but amount to further details specifying the murder participation, or giving further detail on the mode of participation in the indictment.  

The Prosecutor also submits that the addition of the word Akazu in paragraph 6, does not expand Nzirorera's potential liability at all, in fact, the word Akazu is merely descriptive.  The Prosecutor would not make -- if the word Akazu was removed from that allegation, the Prosecutor would not remove any individual's name as is specified there, the indictment would read exactly the same.  All the individuals there listed in paragragh 6 would remain because Akazu is not a separate group, it is merely a descriptive term applied to other individuals who fall within the other categories listed there, and so as a factual matter, nothing will change.  It is simply to give the Defence further notice that some individuals would be referred to both as businessmen, for example, and as members of Akazu, or as military leaders and as members of Akazu.  So nothing is added.  It is just further clarification.  

In the same way, the amendments to paragragh 18 do not constitute new charges.  They are clarifying the identity of subordinates.  Nzirorera takes issue with the way in which paragragh 18 was reorganised in response to the Trial Chamber's decision.  There are no new categories of people put into the indictment.  The fact that Nzirorera and the other Accused were in control of MRND party leaders at all levels of government is the central feature of the case.  If you read the indictment from February 2005, that fact is made explicit when you read the indictment as a whole, which, of course, we are required to do.  What has happened in paragragh 18 in response to the Trial Chamber's decision is simply that that coordination and that control is made explicit in that paragragh, and that's what the Prosecutor interpreted the decision to require.  

In the same way, the reference to the Amahindure is nothing new.  The Accused's control of the Interahamwe was, in fact, pleaded in the February indictment, and there is a specific allegation, in fact, in the February indictment to the Amahindure being a subset of the Interahamwe.  That is found at paragragh 62.5 of the February indictment.  So again, what has changed here is that that is simply made explicit in paragragh 18 in response to the Trial Chamber's direction that that paragragh be made more clear.  

Finally, as I have noted, we have already responded to Ngirumpatse's contention with respect to paragragh 24.8, and that did not constitute new charges either.  So, in summary, the Prosecutor submits that no new charges have been added, and since no new charges have been added, Rule 50 does not apply at all, and that point is made clear in the Krnojelac decision from 20th May of 1999. 

With respect to the second issue, the conformity of the indictment with the Trial Chamber's decision, the Prosecutor submits that the indictment is, in fact, in conformity.  Nzirorera takes issue with the amendment made to paragragh 24.8.  That paragragh -- the Trial Chamber gave us, the Prosecutor, direction to amend that paragragh, because it is said that it was ambiguous to refer to several meetings, but to give details as to one meeting, and that it was ambiguous because it was unclear whether evidence will be adduced on only one meeting or more than one.  The purpose of the amendment was to clarify that the Prosecutor will adduce evidence on several meetings, and, therefore, that was put in the indictment, that there were several meetings that took place.  

Now, as stated in the amendment, the Prosecutor is unable to specify the dates of each of these meetings, and, therefore, in conformity with other aspects of the decision, it is stated that it was unable to be specific.  It gave the time frame 1993 and 1994.  

Finally, with respect to the allegations of elaboration on command responsibility and on responsibility for the attack on the Ruhengeri court of appeals in paragragh 62.12, Nzirorera is correct that there were no modifications made to the indictment in those respects.  The Prosecutor submits that he is not able to further elaborate on those particular aspects to the indictment, and that the indictment in those respects is sufficiently pleaded as it is.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Lombardi.   

Does counsel for Ngirumpatse wish to make a response? 
MR. WEYL:  
Mr. President, very briefly.  I would like to thank you for giving us the floor.  I also wish to say. simply, the Chamber has taken note of its decision of August and stated that the amended indictment of 
24th August 2005 does not correspond to its decision when the Chamber requested the Prosecutor to remove among -- other people from the indictment.  This is something which cannot be reintroduced in another way by going around the difficulty by saying that we are including names in a longer list.  The decision did emanate from the Chamber and it will note that the amended indictment is not in conformity with its directions and, therefore, we would request that we be allowed another motion, because the response provided by the Prosecutor is only sidestepping the issue and we believe that the Chamber will grant that request for a motion to be filed.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I would like to be heard briefly in reply.  

Our point is with respect to new charges.  There had been new subordinates or co-members of the joint criminal enterprise, whose conduct Mr. Nzirorera is now legally responsible for under the indictment of 24th August 2005, that he was not responsible for under the previous indictment.  Probably the clearest example of that is in paragragh 18 when a whole category of MRND officials have been added to the list of subordinates.  We also interpret the addition of the group Akazu and the group Amahindure to add new subordinates.  The Prosecutor said it is just descriptive of existing people who are listed, and I think it is the burden of the Prosecutor to be clear about that, and the indictment is not clear on that point.  It is clear that a whole host of MRND officials on the préfectural level all the way down to the cellule, have now been added as subordinates of the Accused -- subordinate. 

The Kajelijeli decision on the Prosecutor's motion to correct the indictment rendered on the 25th January 2001, is directly on point.  In that case, the Trial Chamber held that there were certain paragraghs that added new charges, and, therefore, new initial appearance, new preliminary motions were necessary.  Among the paragraghs that the Trial Chamber held constituted a new charge, which was paragragh 4.3 of the proposed amended indictment, in the original indictment, it had been alleged that Mr. Kajelijeli, as the bourgmestre, had authority over civil servants posted in his commune and the civilian population.  The amended indictment alleged that he had authority over the members of the police communal and the gendarmerie.  The Trial Chamber held that those new allegations adding different subordinates to that of Mr. Kajelijeli constituted new charges through which Rule 50(B) applied, if that case is directly on point.  

With respect to the appeals decision in the Muvunyi case, we believe also that the instances in which the Appeals Chamber found that new charges were laid against Colonel Muvunyi are analogous to the situation here.  In those two situations, the personal involvement of the Accused in the events had not been alleged in the original indictment, but were alleged in the amended indictment, and the Appeals Chamber said that, "That provides new charges because it now makes the Accused liable for conduct for which he was not previously liable."  We think the same situation occurs here where crimes committed by MRND presence at these various levels will not previously have been events to which Mr. Nzirorera has liability, but under the current indictment are now events for which he incurs liability.  And so, we ask -- this is a motion under Rule 73, it's actually in opposition to the Prosecutor's implied request for leave to file this amended indictment.  We ask that the Court deny leave to file the amended indictment, because it is not in conformity with your order.    

Your order asked them to make things more specific, not to expand allegations against the Accused at this late stage.  And similarly, we believe that in paragragh 18 and 62.12, where the Prosecutor did not obey the Trial Chamber's order, made no changes to the indictment despite specific orders to do so, they did not comply with the order of 5th August and they should be ordered to do so, and the relief that we are seeking is for the Trial Chamber to direct the Prosecutor to file an indictment that conforms in all respects to the decision of 5th August.  Thank you.

1000H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Lombardi, before we actually consider our ruling on this matter, there are two matters arising which we would just like to ask you about.  You have said that with regard to paragraph 62 60.12 -- 62.12, that no information was provided as required.  Why was that?  Is it that you don't have information, or is there some other reason?  
MR. LOMBARDI: 
Yes.  The -- no further information was provided because, upon review, the Prosecutor is unable to be any more specific than it already was.  The allegation that is pled there is that Nzirorera is responsible for ordering that attack and that there were other individuals involved, and that is as specific as we could be. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, is that -- if that is as specific as you can be, should the allegation remain in the indictment?  
MR. LOMBARDI: 
In the Prosecutor's -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you have no other information, why should the allegation remain?  
MR. LOMBARDI: 
In the Prosecutor's submission, it should remain in the indictment.  The Trial Chamber found, in fact, in its decision that the allegation was adequately pled.  I believe I can quote from the decision.  And with respect to the mode of liability, I believe it is sufficient under the pleading principles that govern the pleading of mode of liability for that particular allegation. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  And then with regard to paragraph 24.8, you made the comment that the Prosecutor will adduce evidence on several meetings but is unable to specify the date on each meeting, as requested by our order.  Why are you unable to do that?  Is it that you don't have information, or is there some other reason why you can't do it?  
MR. LOMBARDI: 
The -- the reason that we are unable to be specific as to the dates of meeting is because the witnesses who will testify to these particular events cannot give us a particular date.  And there is -- there are a number of meetings.  They occurred over a -- a -- a period of time in 1993 and in 1994, and we cannot specify exactly when they occurred during that window of time, and so we pled in -- in the way that we did for that reason.  And we specified that we were unable to be more specific in the indictment. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We think we will consider this a bit -- there was something else you wanted to add, Mr. -- 
MR. LOMBARDI: 
No.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll rise shortly and consider -- consider our ruling on this matter. 

Now, the next item on our order of business today relates to the pre-trial Defence brief for Karemera.  In a letter of 8th September 2005 addressed to the presiding Judge in the current proceedings, the Defence for Karemera claims that pursuant to the Chamber's decision of 12th July 2005, it is entitled to file a pre -- a Defence pre-trial brief within one month from the filing of the translation of the amended indictment.  

Now, the Chamber could note first that pursuant to Rule 73 bis (f) under the rules, there is no right for the Defence to file a pre-trial brief, and the Chamber did not order that.  

Secondly, in the decision of 12th July 2005, considering that the Defence for Nzirorera had indicated its intention to file a pre-trial brief and the particular situation of the Defence of Ngirumpatse, who had new counsel, the Defence (sic) considered that it was appropriate to grant additional time for all Defence teams to file any pre-trial brief if they wished to do so.  While the Chamber specified that this filing should take place no later than 12th August 2005, the Chamber did not make an order granting one month to reply. 

Now, we are -- we have considered the -- the motions that we have had before us, and we expect that at the beginning of the next week, Monday or Tuesday, that we will be able to deliver all decisions relating to the indictment and the commencement of trial.  In the meantime, I think I should announce that the indications are that we will be expecting trial to commence on the 19th of September, so it would be appropriate for appropriate preparatory steps to be made to that end. 

Now, what we'd like to do now is to rise for a short while to consider our ruling, unless there are any other issues which anybody thinks should be raised at this point in time. 

Mr. Prosecutor, is there anything you wish to -- to raise at this time?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
That depends, Your Honour, on what the Court expects to do when it comes from its recess.  Are there -- do we have an agenda that we're going to go through?  If I was aware of the agenda for your return, then my concerns would be addressed in the context of the agenda.  But I don't really know what we're going to do after you announce your decisions after the brief recess.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I -- there were -- there were two issues which had been raised by -- by counsel at its informal discussions with the Trial Chamber team, and that had to do with the policy with regard to motions and the policy with regard to the admission of exhibits.  We had not decided on a final position on either of these matters.  We, of course, would like to encourage -- encourage the parties to submit oral submissions where that is possible.  We do not feel that we should set aside a special day for motions.  In fact, we don't see any reason why there should be so many motions that would require any such arrangement. 

With regard to the admission of exhibits, again, we didn't think that it was appropriate at this stage to make a final order, but the thinking that we have at the moment is that the normal method for marking exhibits should be using P plus a number for the Prosecution exhibits and either D for the Defence or another acronym to identify which defendant plus a number for the Defence exhibits, and that they should be numbered in the order of their admission.  But it's ordered that -- that is possibly how we think it's -- likely will - will be ruled on. 

So those were the only other issues that we had on our -- on our -- on our list of matters to be dealt with today.  I don't know if there is any other issues. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Well, in that case, there are additional issues that I would like to address.  

Number one, I'm concerned about the courtroom that we're going to be using for the trial.  I would hope and it would be welcome news if I was to learn that we would settle for the trial in this very courtroom, because I notice that it's well equipped, it has computer facilities and video recording capacities which courtroom 4 does not have, and I would be very disappointed if I -- if it would be -- if it were to be confirmed that we were going to be in courtroom 4 for three years trying a case of this complexity.  We have a number of video clips that will be shown to witnesses on a regular basis.  For the last week or so, we've put in a good number of hours with the EDP unit and our own evidence unit to try to equip that courtroom so that we could show our exhibits in a way that was efficient, and we're encountering difficulties.  So I would bear upon the Court to perhaps intervene with the registry to see if we could be transferred to a courtroom that was more appropriate for a case of this size and complexity and length. 

It's also an issue for the successful completion of this trial.  The Court and the parties will recall that we started this case back in November of 2003, and one of the issues that arose when we were trying to continue the case, after a Judge removed herself, was whether the testimony of witnesses had been recorded.  Because that was an issue for ruling on a 15 bis application or a motion under Rule 15.  And I'm concerned for a case of this length, and in interests of the integrity of the Chamber as it would be composed for the trial, that all testimony of witnesses be audio and video recorded, and courtroom 4 does not have that capacity, and I'm wondering if this Trial Chamber has made advance -- has made arrangements to anticipate that problem.  I think every witness should be recorded so that we don't encounter the type of difficulties that we faced last year. 

So that's just on the question of logistics and administrative arrangements. 

Practically speaking, in terms of -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can I assure you that the Court shares your sentiments.  I can assure you that our Chamber shares those sentiments, but we also have to apply for courtrooms.  We don't decide which court we have.  But I can assure you that we're making every effort to -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I just wanted to indicate to the Court that the Prosecutor's willing to fight on the side of the -- of justice and the Trial Chamber on that issue, because we -- I think, I understand Mr. Nzirorera or Mr. Robinson will agree, since it was at his insistence that this issue came up before, recording of all witness testimony.  

But that's just one issue, Your Honour.  Another practical issue that we're facing is problems of witness management.  I think the Court is aware that we're still trying to work out the logistics for testimony from Witnesses G and T from The Hague.  The Court has already indicated that it will be delivering decisions early next week.  I would expect that one of those decisions concerns our pending application for special protective measures for Witnesses G and T.  And we're in a very difficult position now moving forward and planning for the beginning of trial without knowing where we stand with respect to those two witnesses.  Our chief of Prosecution is currently in The Hague.  He is dealing with the logistical arrangements that need to put in place in order to take that testimony, and we can't plan effectively to -- to provide the Defence with an order -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Catherine.  

Mr. Webster, I should remind you that probably this discussion should be cut short at this stage because we are in open session. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I was aware of that, Your Honour.  I don't think I've said anything that cannot be discussed -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, one of your applications was that no matter concerning this should be discussed except in closed session.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.

MR. PRESIDENT:
That was your application. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay.  Yes, it was.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But I can assure you it's been considered, and the decision will be forthcoming. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Right.  The problem with that, though, is that in order for us to provide the Defence with an order of witness testimony, we have to get -- we have to have some clarity on what witnesses will be available and how they will be made available to the Court.  So that's a concern that, I think, needs to be addressed at another meeting or another way of the -- bringing the parties and the Chamber together before we actually start with the openings.  

There's another matter that concerns us.  It's an internal OTP matter, but I bring it to the Court's attention simply because it has an impact on how we start the trial.  And that is, our first witness who is anticipated to be our investigator, Mr. Upel -- excuse me, Mr. Upendra Baghel, was called away on an emergency basis two days ago, and we had anticipated his presence here in Arusha for the next two weeks, and he's not here now.  And he expects to be back in Arusha by next weekend, which places us in a difficult position to start on Monday.  And I think -- or I'm suggesting to the Court that a more appropriate start date would be Wednesday, the 21st, because he would be back in time to prepare adequately in time to begin the trial on Wednesday.  So I would bear upon the Court to consider a start date of Wednesday, of 21st, as opposed to Monday, the 19th. 

We do have witnesses present here in -- in Arusha, factual witnesses.  I had indicated to the Defence earlier that Witness GOB we had anticipated for the beginning of session will only be available towards the end of the session.  But on the issue of witness testimony and the logistics of arranging for the testimony of witnesses, my suggestion is that the parties gather again before the opening in order to resolve those issues because we cannot resolve them without clear instructions from the Trial Chamber concerning a few of the pending motions. 

I think -- I think those are my concerns.  I'm aware that Mr. Robinson had a number of disclosure issues that he wanted to raise that we could not raise in our informal meetings.  If those are going to be issues for stating the trial, I suggest that we deal with them now.  I mean, a few of them are contained in some of the pending motions, but my recollection is that not all of them are in -- are in the pending motions.  So I would like to address as many issues as possible this morning before we -- we break up, and I would invite the other parties to put all pending issues on the table now so that we can deal with them effectively.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President.  First, I would like to state for the record that we do request that all testimony be video recorded, and I see that -- I believe that that's a desire of everyone.  

Secondly, I agree with Mr. Webster that there was a need for another session before the trial commences.  I expect to have motions that would logically follow from the Trial Chamber's rulings on matters contained in the indictment, and those motions may include exclusion of evidence of witnesses in the -- who are expected to testify in the first session for failure to comply with disclosure rules.  And until we see what the ruling is on the indictment, I don't think it's appropriate for me to raise those issues now.  So I would ask that the Trial Chamber consider scheduling a further pre-trial conference for some time after it's rendered its decisions on the pending motions. 

With respect to disclosure issues, there are disclosure issues that are contentious between the parties, particularly transcripts that OTP says should be provided by court management and court management says should be provided by OTP and the consequence of which we don't have, which now has escalated to 21 witnesses.  But it's also possible that those witnesses won't be coming to testify if you dismiss Count 5.  So I think it's best to wait for a ruling on the motions before we discuss any further matters with respect to disclosure issues.  

So I have nothing further other than those matters.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.  

Any other Defence team has anything to say at this time?  
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President.  For the Defence of Mr. Ngirumpatse, I would, first of all, underscore the fact that failure is not customary.  We are generally opposed to such submissions, but we wish to underscore the fact that we should be addressed in French and in English.  I would like to thank the Prosecutor for having done this, and I wish that he continues in that line.  

With regard to the proposals made today, yes, the trial that we are undergoing should be held in a chamber as this -- a courtroom as this, and we wouldn't wish our Chamber to take place in the basements, as it were.  And we would wish that the Chamber deploys all necessary efforts to ensure that we can have this courtroom.  

With regard to the witnesses to be heard in the first session, the Prosecutor is saying that he is in a difficult situation because it is -- he is not aware of the rulings that the Chamber will have for special protection for certain witnesses.  I think that if the Prosecutor is in a difficult situation, then the Defence situation would be worse than that still.  We need to adapt to the fact that if we are to be sharing our tasks within the teams, the Defence teams, the difficulties the Prosecutor is encountering is even worse for us.  So we would go along with the proposal that the 21st of September be considered for the commencement of trial.  We have considered several dates from the 1st of September -- the 5th of September, and I would say that, with the image of an aircraft which is going to take off, we need to look at what is ready for take-off and what is not.  I think we need to go along in this manner and not say that we are going to start trial every two days and so on.  And I think we would select a date which we will not go back on.  I think if we were to consider the 26th of September, that would be more lucid, given the difficulties that are still being faced by the Prosecutor.  He is saying the 21st.  Maybe the Prosecutor, as commander on board, should consider that we need the extended time to ensure that our checklist is correct and fully met so that you don't risk coming back to the airport just a little bit after you have taken off.  

Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MR. SOW: 
Thank you very much, Mr. President.  Mr. President, I simply wish to say that I believe that what will enable us to determine how to move would be the decisions that you will be rendering.  You have indicated that at the latest by Tuesday we shall have the rulings on all the decisions, and this would enable us to decide that after your decisions are rendered, we would need to have another meeting, another conference, so that we can have a better look at the future.  I think that it is your decisions who -- which will determine how we will move, and I think we should stick to that, Your -- Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 

We propose a short recess at this stage.  
(Court recessed from 1029H to 1051H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, during the recess we decided that we should schedule the continuance of this pre-trial conference for Wednesday of next week at 2:30 p.m., that is, Wednesday, the 14th of September, at 2:30.  I think that that should give us an opportunity to finally dispose of all the pending issues and deal with the other matters which were raised this morning, as far as we're able to do so. 

We will take time to consider our ruling with regard to the matters raised in the motions concerning the observations on the indictment. 

Unless there are any other issues, I think we should close our session now.  Does anybody have any -- 

Then we adjourn our conference to Wednesday, the 14th of September, at 2:30 p.m.
(Court adjourned at 1055H)
