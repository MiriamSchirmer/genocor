(Witness entered courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
 Good afternoon, everybody.

Madam registrar, would you open the proceedings, please?
MS. KOUO:
Yes, Mr. President.  Thank you.

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short and Judge Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, the 15th of November 2006, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor v. Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.

Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The appearances are the same.
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  Actually, I would like to welcome back our intern, Nikki Palmer, who was in South Africa for the last 10 days, and she was selected to be a Rhodes Scholar while she was there, and she will be going to Oxford next fall.  So I want to welcome her back and congratulate her.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Well, welcome back, and congratulations.  I thought you were replaced, but I now see the Nzirorera team has two interns.

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
There are just two housekeeping matters to deal with before we start your -- or, allow Mr. Robinson to continue his examination of you.

We would just like to state that we did receive translations of the document supplied by the witness to us.  And we are going to give a ruling during the course of this afternoon.

The second issue is to enquire from the witness: did you have an opportunity to look at the video -- at the tape?
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Actually, I was able to able to look at the tape with keen attention.  I noticed that, as a matter of fact, I had mistook Nzirorera for someone else, but that does not mean, as Defence counsel claims, that I said Nzirorera had made a speech on that occasion.  By the way, I would like to tell you that I was able to observe the people -- or, the person whom I had mistaken for Nzirorera.  And, as I said in my statement to the Prosecutor, whenever there was a political rally, I always went to the rally to ensure the security of the party members.  So, since I was not present when the rally started at the place where I was when members of the MRND matter were introduced -- I heard that it was in Ruhengeri.  So when that person was introduced, I thought it was Nzirorera.  That is what I was able to see this morning.  All this is just to tell you that I have noticed that it was not Nzirorera as I had earlier thought.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Well, we are now going to allow you to continue your testimony.  I remind you that are you are under the same oath to tell the truth, and Mr. Robinson will continue his examination now.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, I'd also like to inform you that we are yet to have received the original letter sent by this witness concerning his security, that you ordered disclosed to us yesterday, as well as the transcript of the broadcast.  So, we are still not -- we don't have that, but I'll continue my cross-examination until you make your ruling, and perhaps the registry can make enquiries in the meantime to see that we get that, because I'll need that before the cross-examination is concluded.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have noted your comments, Mr. Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you very much, Mr. President.
WITNESS HH,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness HH, (no interpretation).
A.	I'm fine, Counsel.
Q.	Witness HH, I appreciate your looking at the video this morning.  I don't understand exactly your comments, however, because the way I understood it, you had said yesterday that Nzirorera made a speech on the occasion of that meeting, and then today you've come in and said that "That does not mean that I said Nzirorera made a speech."  So can we start off by agreeing that yesterday when you testified about the Ruhengeri meeting you did, indeed, claim that Mr. Nzirorera had made a speech; is that not correct?
A.	I said I saw him, but I did not say that he spoke -- or, that he made a speech.  Now, if you have any proof, then you can show it.  I did not say that he spoke.  I said he was present, so I'm not changing anything to what I said yesterday.
Q.	Witness, what you said yesterday, I'll submit to you -- we have a transcript of what you said yesterday.  Do you see that -- these people on the side of the Judges, whenever you are talking in court, they are taking down the exactly what you say.  And I submit to you that what you said yesterday was clearly that not only was Mr. Nzirorera present, but he made a speech.  And so, the Trial Chamber will review the transcript and review what you've said and they can compare whether you are continuing to tell stories, in contradiction to evidence that's already before it.  And I won't argue that point with you, but I tell you that --
A.	You are right, sir.  The Judges are going to look at what was said yesterday, and I also believe that they will examine my prior statements.  You are saying that I said yesterday that Nzirorera spoke.  Now, if you are saying such a thing, then, perhaps, you may have seen it in some document somewhere.
Q.	Well, Witness HH, I think we all heard it yesterday.  That's your problem, and, once again, you have been caught in a fantasy.  You told us he was in Ruhengeri, but you didn't know we had the tape.  Now you know we have the tape and you are caught.  Now you are telling us today that you didn't say he made a speech, but we have the transcript and, once again, you're caught.

And I want to remind you, Witness HH, you took an oath when you testified here to tell the truth, and you are skating very close to a crime called false testimony, which can be prosecuted by this Tribunal.  I think you need to know that because your testimony is becoming very, very seriously problematic for you, and I just want you to know that before I continue.  Do you understand?
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I request that those types of instructions be given to the witness by the Court, not by Defence counsel.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, Mr. Robinson is counsel only, in this case.

You wanted me to tell you something, Mr. Robinson?  What I was thinking was that I hadn't intended to say anything more than I said; I thought I had said enough.  But you cannot really sound as though you are speaking on behalf of the Court when you speak to a witness in that manner.
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well, I understand, Mr. President.  If you will just give me a moment; I want to look up a rule.

Mr. President, at this time I would ask the Trial Chamber to advise the witness, in light of the answers that he has given to questions concerning the Ruhengeri meeting, of the penalties of perjury in this Tribunal so that any further testimony can be, if necessary, addressed by -- under Rule 77.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we don't think that the situation warrants us to give a warning at this stage.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if I could just -- so, I can make myself clear -- I had a little difficulty finding the correct rule.  But Rule 91(A) says that a Chamber, proprio motu or at the request of a party, may warn a witness of the duty to tell the truth and the consequences that may result from a failure to do so.  And so I'm making that request to you under Rule 91(A) in light of the clear contradiction between the witness's own testimony and the irrefutable evidence from the video, as well as from our own transcript.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We understood what you are requesting and we declined to exercise our discretion at this stage.  We don't think the matter had reached a stage it was warranted to say that to the witness.  I may give an indication of a certain stage of conclusion, which we have not reached as yet.
MR. ROBINSON:
I have --
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's what I should have -- I could have been more explicit and said all that, but I thought that just saying that was sufficient.
MR. ROBINSON:
I -- it was more my fault.  I, myself, was concerned that I hadn't cited you to the rule, and I don't want it to be later said that I didn't give you an adequate opportunity to make a ruling in my favour.  So, I've done that and we can move on.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness HH, we are going to talk about some other meetings.  We will start with the one in Gisenyi that you have testified about in your direct examination.  You recall that you testified that you attended a rally of the MRND at Umuganda stadium and that you placed the time of that between the RPF attack in February 1993 and the death of President Ndadaye in October 1993; is that correct?
A.	That's right, Counsel, but you remember when I said that, I told you it was an estimation.
Q.	I understand that, Witness HH, and I'm going to help you try and make the best estimate of when this rally that you claim to have attended occurred.  Do you recall who was the secretary general of the MRND at the time of this rally?
A.	I think Mathieu Ngirumpatse was the holder of that position during the period when that Gisenyi rally took place.
Q.	And would you agree, then, that that would place the rally sometime before July of 1993?
A.	Yeah, but as I just told you, the year was correct, but I was not sure about the month.  It was an estimation.
Q.	Yes, I understand that and I don't fault you for that at all, but I'm just trying to be clear that now that you realise that Ngirumpatse was secretary general we can deduce from that, can we not, that this meeting took place before July 1993?
A.	What I said was that the meeting in question took place in 1993.  I think what is of importance is to know that the meeting took place, indeed.
Q.	Well, can we agree that Mr. Ngirumpatse was elected president and Mr. Nzirorera was elected secretary general at the MRND congress in Amahoro stadium in July of 1993?
A.	Yes, I think it was at that period.
Q.	Thank you, Witness HH.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, may the witness be directed to remove his headphones for a minute?  I would like to make an application to the Trial Chamber.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, could you remove your headphone, please?
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, you may recall that during the Prosecution's examination of the witness on this subject, I made a motion to exclude evidence concerning this meeting in which I can tender that it was not a meeting that had been alleged in the indictment.  I believe it's paragraph 25.2 which alleges a meeting in Gisenyi on the 27th of October 1993, but the state of the evidence as elicited by Mr. Webster was that the meeting took place sometime, perhaps as late as the day of the death of President Ndadaye, which was on the 23rd of October 1993, and given that state of the record, the Trial Chamber ruled that the evidence was not to be excluded.

However, now we have received different information showing that the meeting, in fact, took place before July of 1993, and so we are not talking about the same meeting that is plead in the indictment, and there are no other meetings in Gisenyi that are plead in the indictment, and I -- instead of going through all my questions concerning this meeting -- or, before going through all my questions regarding this meeting, I would ask that you exclude this evidence for not having been in the indictment or the pre-trial brief.  Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I suggest that this motion is still quite premature and it's quite off track.  My understanding is that the witness is referring to the same meeting that was pleaded in the indictment.  All of the witnesses that we have for this particular meeting described it in very specific terms, describe it in the same terms as this witness has described it.  This witness has repeatedly stated that he cannot provide dates for certain events, and even in his last two or three responses he reluctantly conceded to Mr. Robinson that Ngirumpatse was secretary general at the time the rally took place.  It was after repeated questions that he moved in that direction, but it's clear from his testimony, and this Court should be able to see it already, that this witness states that he does not know when in 1993 this rally took place.  And if Mr. Robinson wants to make this application at a later time, after he has elicited details of the rally -- or, the witness's recollection of the rally, then maybe at this point the Court could consider the motion.  But at this stage there's not even enough on the record for the Court to make a determination.  And it's my contention -- or, the Prosecution contention that this witness is talking about the very same meeting that is pleaded in the indictment.  When we pleaded that meeting -- pleaded the date of that meeting, it was clearly stated in the indictment that it was "on or about" the 27th of October.  No one knows for sure the exact date of that rally.  What we do know is that it took place in 1993 and that the military authorities were present.  That's how we distinguish that rally from other MRND rallies.  So, I suggest that Mr. Robinson's motion be denied.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you wish to respond?
MR. ROBINSON:
No, Mr. President, I think you have all the elements necessary.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, it's too early for us to make a finding of fact that would permit us to make the ruling to which you are -- for which you are applying.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I will ask some questions about the meeting then.  Can the witness be signalled to put the headphones ...

Thank you.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness HH, thank you very much for accommodating us.  Now, I am going to ask some questions about that meeting at Umuganda stadium.  First of all, did you escort anyone from Kigali to that meeting?
A.	I went to that rally in my capacity as an Interahamwe and for purposes of security, ensuring security.  So, I did not accompany one figure of authority or another.  We went there to ensure the security of our members, the safety of our members.
Q.	Witness HH, I am going to read to you from the statement of the 11th of November that you made to the Office of the Prosecutor and, in particular, I am going to read from page 10 of the English version, the fifth paragraph from the top, and you've told us that this statement is true.  You told us this several times, to pay close attention to your statements after the -- after the******************, so we are doing that now.  And this is what you said then to the Office of the Prosecutor: "I also provided escort to Ngirumpatse, Karemera and Casimir Bizimungu in 1993 to a rally in Gisenyi."  Now, did you make such a statement in November 2004?
A.	I have just heard the extract, but since I tell you that I was in charge of ensuring the security of our members and those leaders were present at the meeting, and I was -- meeting -- or, rally, and as I was responsible for the security of the participants, how can you think that I was not also responsible for ensuring the security of those leaders who attended?
Q.	Now, Witness, you are not answering my question, because this is not talking about ensuring security.  Now, first of all, I'm asking you: did you make the statement in November 2004 to the Prosecution that "I also provided escort to Ngirumpatse, Karemera and Casimir Bizimungu in 1993 to a rally in Gisenyi"?  Did you make that statement to the Prosecution in November 2004?
A.	You have a written text before you, but since you are putting a question to me, I must answer the question, as put, and if I am allowed to do so, I should like to explain myself in more detail, because I note that when you put questions, most of the time it was -- it sounds like a threat.  It sounds menacing.  You say each time that I'm speaking untruths, telling lies, but I should like to be allowed to provide proof, according to which you, yourself, are telling lies, speaking untruths.  The problem is that when you put questions to me, you are -- it sounds menacing, you are proffering threats, and I would ask the President to be allowed to show -- to prove that you, yourself, are speaking untruths.
Q.	Witness, I have just asked you about something that you said in the past so any untruths are yours, not mine.  I'm just repeating your words.  And you haven't answered the question.  So, it's very simple, I asked you if you -- if you, yourself, had said in November 2004 that "I also provided escort to Ngirumpatse, Karemera and Casimir Bizimungu in 1993 to a rally in Gisenyi".  Now, did you say that or not.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before the witness answers, I would just like to say something to him.  Mr. Witness --
THE WITNESS:
I'm listening to you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- everybody in the Chamber has their own function.  Now, one of the functions of the Judges here is to ensure that there is fairness to everybody in our Chamber.  That means fairness to the persons who are on trial.  It also means fairness to the witnesses.  And so, we will be ensuring that counsel does not ask questions which are improper and not permitted by the rules, and we will ensure that that doesn't happen.

Now, in relation to the questions that he has put to you, those that he has put up to you up now are permitted and you can answer them without feeling that you are being threatened or intimidated in any way.  As I mentioned to you earlier, one of the duties of counsel is to try to test the witness, who is giving testimony, to assist the Court in determining the extent to which we can rely on the witness's testimony.

Now, the remarks that counsel makes, other than questions, you should not pay much attention to that, and I would ask him to refrain or limit the types of remarks that he makes.  But you should be content, yourself, with trying to understand what is the question that he is asking you, and to respond as best as you can to it.

Do you understand?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, I indeed understand, and I thank you.  Perhaps at one point in the trial, I shall ask to be authorised to say something as to what the -- what counsel is saying, but I have understood.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, Mr. Robinson, you have made the witness feel that he is being threatened.  That's his perception.  It's really not part of cross-examination to do that, and if you would restructure your approach to some extent, we'd appreciate it.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I'll do that, Mr. President.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Witness, if you want to say something, you can say it now.  It's no problem.  If you have something you would like to say, go ahead and say it; we are listening.
A.	Thank you.  As I have just said, you used some terms that make me think that you are threatening me.  You're always repeating that I'm telling lies.  Myself, I tell you that practically everything you say are lies.  Since -- your colleagues, your fellow counsel, that preceded you also told me that I was telling lies and when I tell you that we were told to draw up lists of Tutsi who had sent that children to join the ranks of the RPF-Inkotanyi, when I tell you that we drew up lists of opponents of the MRND party and we sent those lists to MRND headquarters, you, yourself, and counsel that preceded you tried to demonstrate before this Trial Chamber that I was lying.

I have narrated what Ngirumpatse said in Ruhengeri.  Check what he said at that rally.  If you consider what he said -- analyse what he said first, before saying that I am telling lies.  I'm telling you events I lived through, of which I was an eyewitness.  You continue saying that I'm telling lies.  I would ask you to, please, stop considering me as a liar, because I'm speaking of things of which I was an eyewitness, and I know that I will, one day, have the opportunity to explain myself.  I have proof.  So, take a look at what Mathieu Ngirumpatse said in Ruhengeri, and I think you'll stop being hostile towards me once you have analysed what he said.
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness HH.  We have heard what you've said, and now I go back to my question: did you on the 3rd -- 11th of November 2004, tell the Office of the Prosecutor, "I also provided escort to Ngirumpatse, Karemera and Casimir Bizimungu in 1993 to a rally in Gisenyi"?
A.	Thank you.  I made statements to OTP people and they wrote down what I had said.  So, I cited those top leaders, and I remember that Casimir Bizimungu also stopped in Ruhengeri, never went beyond Ruhengeri.  I said that we had found some members.  We came -- we found them on our way back on the road.  Casimir Bizimungu never arrived in Gisenyi because we found him in -- on our way back from Gisenyi.  And I must also repeat that I was in charge of the security -- the safety of the members.
Q.	So, then, do we agree that the statement that the OTP recorded, where it says that you claim to have provided escort to Ngirumpatse, Karemera and Casimir Bizimungu in 1993 to a rally in Gisenyi -- that statement is not correct; is that what you are saying?
A.	I repeat: I was in charge of security, the close protection of the figures of authority in the party, as well as the security of the members, in general.  I mentioned the name of those top politicians because there was the party chairman, the party president, and other people -- leading people were in the convoy, so it's normal that I should have mentioned their names.
Q.	Well, are you now telling us, then, that you travelled in convoy from Kigali to Gisenyi with Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Édouard Karemera and Casimir Bizimungu?
A.	Among the responsibilities I had -- moreover, I arrived in Gisenyi and returned to Ruhengeri.  So, I gave the names of the top headers in my party in the statement I made to the OTP people, because among my responsibilities was the protection of the party members, whether at the meeting or on the way there or back, so that's why I made that statement.
Q.	I'm trying to understand, Witness, what actually happened.  So, you've told us originally that you did not provide an escort to any of the dignitaries of the MRND when you travelled from Kigali to Gisenyi.  And then I asked you if you had claimed to have provided an escort to Ngirumpatse, Karemera and Casimir Bizimungu to this rally, and now from -- what I understand you're saying, is that you said that, yes, you did make that statement to the Prosecution, but you meant that you provided security at the meeting and you didn't really travel with them from Kigali.  Is that what you are trying to tell us now?
A.	No.  I'm trying to explain things in general.  I named the three top party leaders, and I know that I ensured their security.  It was part of my responsibilities, and they knew that I was entrusted with their security.  So, I was part of the escort that had to ensure the security of our members, so I mentioned their names because they were leaders in our party, and I told you that when I arrived in Gisenyi, I turned back and went to Ruhengeri, also.
Q.	Okay.  Well, Witness, I think we have taken that as far as we can take it and it will be up to the Trial Chamber whether that prior statement is indicative of -- of lack of credibility or whether it's indicative of some other explanation.  And so, I want to ask you now -- turning away from that statement and recalling your memory of this event, if you could tell us with whom you travelled to Gisenyi.
A.	Like whom?  I was with my colleagues in the Interahamwe.  We were supposed to ensure security on the way and, once there, at the stadium.  Whom else do you want me to mention?  Do you want me to give you a list of all our members?  There were many of them.  They were very numerous.  So, I gave the names of those authorities because they were heading our party.
Q.	Well, who was in your vehicle as you travelled from Kigali to Gisenyi?
A.	My vehicle was driven by*****************************************.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
No. 86.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And who else was in the vehicle besides you and**************************?
A.	There were other Interahamwe in my vehicle.  I don't remember their names.
Q.	Were there other secteur presidents of the Interahamwe from Kigali who travelled with you in other vehicles to this rally?
A.	Yes, there were various presidents from various secteurs and we travelled in various vehicles.  My vehicle -- in my vehicle there was*****************, another Interahamwe, lower echelon.  It was a double-cabin Hilux.
Q.	And can you give us the name of other Interahamwe secteur presidents who attended this rally in Gisenyi, besides yourself and*****************************?
A.	I remember the president from Mwendo secteur.  That's the only one I can remember on the spur of the moment.
Q.	Do you remember his name?
A.	Whom are you speaking of, Counsel?  I didn't quite grasp your question.  I didn't comprehend.
Q.	I thought that you had said you travelled with someone from Mwendo secteur, and I didn't hear you mention that person's name, so I was asking what is the name of the Interahamwe president from Mwendo secteur with whom you travelled.
A.	Mahembe.
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  I don't think that came through on the translation.
A.	That was his name, Mahembe.
Q.	Thank you very much.  Now, were any members of the national committee of the Interahamwe present at this rally in Gisenyi?
A.	Well, yes, there must have been.
Q.	And which ones did you see?
A.	Well, I can only say that they were there.  I remember that when we were on the point of leaving, we were sharing out the vehicles.  I saw them.  It was a long time ago, but I remember that the first vice-president -- vice-chairman was there when we were discussing who should sit in which vehicle, and Phénéas Ruhumuliza was there when we were organising the travelling arrangements, the trip.
MR. ROBINSON:
And Phénéas Ruhumuliza is No. 93 on the spelling list.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Was Georges Rutaganda at that rally?
A.	I have just said that they were present, especially at the point of departure.  I saw them.  We didn't go in one vehicle of course, because many of them had their own vehicles.
Q.	Did you see Ephrem Nkezabera at this rally?
MR. ROBINSON:
That's No. 77 on the spelling list.
THE WITNESS:
I don't remember very well.  It was a long time ago.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, can you tell us, the authorities present -- well, first of all, were there any ministers who attended this meeting?
A.	As to ministers, there were plenty of them from the MRND -- in the MRND.  You want me to name them?  But I do remember that when I returned to Ruhengeri I saw Casimir.  He was settling a problem -- trying to settle a problem, because a vehicle had broken down on the way and he was trying to find a solution to that problem.  As to ministers, there were plenty in the MRND and they, of course, had to attend the rally.

1530H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Was the minister of the interior, Faustin Munyaseza, present?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
That's number 67 on the spelling list. 
THE WITNESS:
I don't remember. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Was Augustin Ngirabatware present?  Ngirabatware is spelled the same way as number 75 on the spelling list, although it's a different person.  
A.	The meeting was taking place at his home town, so he had to be there to receive VIPs.  Furthermore, he was an MRND member. 
Q.	Now, do you know an individual named Michel Bagaragaza, B-A-G-A-R-A-Z-A -- actually, I don't think I did spell that right.  It's B-A-R-A-G-A-Z-A -- excuse me.  B-A-R-A-G-A -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, the interpreters can help you, B-A-G-A-R-A-G-A-Z-A.  Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Do you know such a person? 
A.	Yes, I believe I know him.  I saw him on two occasions.  You see, it all happened a long time ago, but I remember that all those personalities were present. 
Q.	So was Michel Bagaragaza present at this rally in Gisenyi; is that your testimony?  
A.	Let me repeat and insist on this point:  It happened a long time ago.  It's not at all easy for me to remember all those who were present. 
Q.	Witness HH, it's not -- it's not an offence.  If you don't remember, you can just say "I don't remember."  So, we know it happened a long time ago, but we just need to know the answer to the question.  Do you remember, was Bagaragaza there or not?  
A.	I don't remember. 
Q.	What about the minister of defence, was he present?  
A.	I also don't remember, but all what I know is that he was an MRND militant. 
Q.	And who are you speaking of? 
A.	I am referring to the defence minister who hailed from Byumba.  I think his name was Bizimana.  He had once been a préfet of Byumba.  I think that's the one. 
Q.	Now, Witness HH, I want to ask you about the authorities of the MRND at the national level who were present at this meeting.  

MR. ROBINSON: 
Before I do, though, Mr. President, I was going a little bit late because we started late, but would you like to take a break now or do you want to take a break at a later time?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't know if anybody else needs to have the break right now, but we are thinking we could take a short break at 4:00.  Okay.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, can you tell us, then, Witness HH, the names of the leaders of the MRND at the national level who you personally saw at this rally in Gisenyi? 
A.	You want to know from me the names of the senior national leaders of the party.  What I would like to tell you is that those events occurred a long -- very long time ago.  I can't remember the names of the personalities in attendance at that rally.  It happened a very long time ago, and you ought to remember that age is taking its toll on me.  So, at my age, it's not easy to remember things. 
Q.	Witness HH, can we agree, then, that you are not able to say that Mr. Nzirorera attended this rally? 
A.	Well, given that nothing prevented Nzirorera from being there, and if there was nothing which made him to be absent, then he must have attended the meeting. 
Q.	Now, Witness, that answer is not correct -- that's not an answer to my question.  I asked you what you saw.  I'm not asking you to be some expert witness about what's supposed -- what's supposed to happen.  So, I'm asking you to understand my question and give me a straight answer.  Did you see Nzirorera at that rally in Gisenyi in 1993?  
A.	No, I don't remember, so I don't know whether or not he was there. 
Q.	Did you see Édouard Karemera at that rally in Gisenyi in 1993? 
A.	I think Karemera was present. 
Q.	Did you see Mathieu Ngirumpatse at that rally in 1993 in Gisenyi? 
A.	I think Mathieu Ngirumpatse was also present. 
Q.	Did you see Ferdinand Kabagema at that rally in Gisenyi in 1993?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
That's number 31 on the spelling list. 
THE WITNESS:
At that time, Kabagema was ill, so I do not think he would have been able to attend that meeting.  He was ill.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, in your statement to the Prosecution in November 2004, you claimed that Ngirumpatse, Karemera, and Kabagema made speeches at that rally.  Now, can you explain to us why you're giving two different answers to the same question? 
A.	I am certain that the MRND president for Gisenyi spoke.  Yes, indeed, I'm certain about that. 
Q.	But my question to you was why you said in 2004 that Kabagema spoke, and you've told us today that he was not present.  
A.	I am saying so because I now remember that at that time Kabagema was ill.  Yes, I do think so.  It's been a long time since I was interviewed. 
Q.	So, you're telling us now that your statement to the Prosecution was not accurate on that point; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, it is now that I start forgetting some answers, so after my interview with the Prosecutor, there are certain things which I've forgotten. 
Q.	Now, what military authorities, if any, did you see at this rally in Gisenyi in 1993?  
A.	As far as I can remember, there was a military authority, but who was in mufti; that is, Nsengiyumva.  But there was also Bagosora.  I remember that those two persons were present. 
Q.	So, your testimony is that at this rally in Gisenyi, you personally saw Colonel Bagosora and 
	Colonel Anatole Nsengiyumva; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I saw them. 
Q.	And did any of them address the rally? 
A.	I no longer remember. 
Q.	And, Witness HH, I'll put it to you that at the time you claim this rally took place, which is sometime before July of 1993, Colonel Anatole Nsengiyumva had not yet been assigned or taken up his duties in Gisenyi.  Do you have any comment to make to that?  
A.	But, Counsel, I simply told you that when I saw him, he was in civilian attire, he was in mufti.  I did not tell you that he was in military attire or that he was in Gisenyi for some particular purpose or because he had been appointed there. 
Q.	Witness HH, given that you were concerned with security at this meeting, did you learn of any incident where a person had been injured in connection with this meeting, seriously injured? 
A.	Counsel, if you had been closely following me, earlier on, I said that when I went to Gisenyi, I had to return to Ruhengeri.  In other words, you ought to not put questions to me regarding all what happened in Gisenyi on that day.  Furthermore, as I've always said, all those events occurred a long time ago. 
Q.	So you have no recollection of any incident of a person being injured in connection with the rally in Gisenyi; is that correct? 
A.	Indeed, I no longer recollect. 
Q.	Now, I'd like to turn your attention to a rally that took place at Nyamirambo stadium after the death of President Ndadaye in October 1993, a rally at which Froduald Karamira -- K-A-R-A-M-I-R-A, it's 
	number 42 on the spelling list -- made a speech in which he used the word "power" several times.  Did you attend that rally? 
A.	Counsel, could you give specifics regarding that rally?  I remember two rallies, so if you could be more specific, then we would be able to understand one another.  I remember a rally in which Mugenzi participated when he had just espoused the power ideas.  

As I am telling you, I remember that rally because, if you remember what I said when I started my testimony, it was not easy for me to sit down and listen to the speeches made on account of my assignment.  I simply remember that Mugenzi spoke. 
Q.	The rally I -- 
A.	Yes, I remember that Mugenzi spoke. 
Q.	The rally I'm speaking of may be a different rally, because, to my knowledge, Mr. Mugenzi was not present at the one that I'm speaking of.  So I'm speaking of a rally that took place on the 
	23rd of October 1993 at Nyamirambo stadium.  It was a rally that was made in connection with a march where people made a demonstration or march to Nyamirambo stadium in connection with the death of the president of Burundi.  

And at that rally, there were speeches made by members of MDR party, particularly, 
Froduald Karamira.  And I'm wondering whether or not -- and in that speech he, at the end, said, 
"MDR Power," and the crowd cheered, "MRND Power," and the crowd cheered, "PSD Power," and the crowd cheered, et cetera.  So, that's the meeting I'm referring to.  Did you attend that meeting? 
A.	Counsel, you just said MDR Power, PSD Power, but I didn't hear you say MRND Power, so how do you think I could have attended such a rally, if it was not a rally organised by the MRND?  You didn't mention MRND Power.  If it was a rally organised by the MRND, I would have attended it.  So, I wasn't there.  
Q.	Well, in fact, I did mention MRND Power.  Perhaps you didn't receive that in the translation.  And it was a rally that was organised by a number of political parties and principally MDR but also included some MRND.  But if you say you weren't there, I'll accept that, but I don't want you to be misled, because, in fact, there was MRND participation in that rally.  So, is it your testimony that you did not attend this rally? 
A.	Perhaps, Counsel, I misconstrued you, because earlier on I heard -- or I thought I heard two political parties mentioned, and you did not mention MRND, which means that I did not attend that meeting.  Earlier on, I told you that if you were referring to the rally which Mugenzi attended and during which he made a speech regarding Ndadaye's death, then I grant you that I attended that rally.  
Q.	Well, it appears, Witness, from your answer that you did not attend the rally in October 1993, and perhaps you did attend the rally on the 16th of January 1994, at which Mr. Mugenzi spoke.  But, in any event, I'm going to move on and ask you some questions about another subject, which is military training. 

Now, you've told us that you yourself received some military training at the office -- or at the building owned by Kabuga, Félicien; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, it is. 
Q.	And that was in the year 1993, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And do you remember who was the secretary-general of the MRND at the time you received that training? 
A.	Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	And how many times did you go for training? 
A.	I don't remember all the training sessions which were organised, but what I know is that training was discontinued following an incident which occurred.  Let me, however, state that the training was for ************************************************************.  
Q.	And how often -- how many times did you go to the training before it was discontinued? 
A.	We were more than ten participating in the training, but we went in in turns, and when we got inside, we would meet two people.  Personally, I went there more than three times. 
Q.	And what did you learn at this training? 
A.	Firstly, we were taught to dismantle and reassemble a firearm.  We were also taught how to fire a weapon. 
Q.	And who had invited you to this training? 
A.	Turatsinze had invited us to that training. 
Q.	And what did he tell you was the reason why you should be trained to handle a firearm? 
A.	We were told to go and attend that training because we had been informed of RPF people who had infiltrated the country already with the design to eliminate certain MRND party members.  
Q.	And were you being trained, then, to provide protection for MRND officials? 
A.	Yes, that was the type of training we received.  In fact, before we got the information from Turatsinze, Mathieu Ngirumpatse had already told us so at Ruhengeri.  He had told us that there were certain MRND party members who were on RPF lists who had been earmarked for elimination by RPF. 
Q.	Okay.  Now, there came a time when you sent others for military training at some places outside Kigali, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And that was later in 1993, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And was that after the signing of the Arusha Accords, which called for the placement of an RPF battalion in Kigali? 
A.	That is what was being said.  Yes, indeed, it was said that talks were ongoing.  I don't know if an agreement was signed, but that is what we were told at a meeting which took place at party headquarters.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse himself told us about it.  He said an RPF battalion had to come. 
Q.	And who was it that told you to select people to go for military training? 
A.	During a meeting**************************, we agreed on that.  And then the following day, we invited Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  He attended that meeting and told us we had to handle the matter cautiously and also make sure those choosing to attend the training were people who could be trusted to keep secrets.  Mathieu himself told us that we had to study the conduct of those people.  But we invited him after the meeting, which had decided on that, had taken place.  It was necessary for Mathieu to come and approve it.  
Q.	Now, these people who were going for this military training, was it your understanding that they were being trained to provide protection for MRND officials like you were trained, or were they being trained to fight against the RPF in the event that hostilities resumed? 
A.	At that time, the urgent matter to handle was to get people who could provide safety and security of party members whose names were on an RPF list and who had been earmarked for elimination.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse himself told us that while we were in Ruhengeri.  He told us that it would be easier because the defence ministry was headed by MRND.  We got that information in 1992 from Mathieu Ngirumpatse during the rally which had taken place in Ruhengeri. 
Q.	And so, was it your understanding that the military training that took place outside of Kigali was to train people who could also be deployed to protect MRND officials?  
A.	Yes, that was being said.  It was said that it was necessary to train lots of young people who, when necessary, would support members of the army, because the enemy had infiltrated the country.  That was being said before the RPF battalion arrived into the country.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, would you like to take our break at this time?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think so.  We take a short recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1603H to 1633H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before the examination continues, we have an oral decision which we wish to deliver. 

Yesterday, the Chamber received a letter from Witness HH following the Chamber's request, as a result of a question from Defence counsel for Nzirorera concerning certain information provided by the witness to judicial authorities.  Since this letter was written in Kinyarwanda by the witness, the registry was requested to provide the Chamber with a translation of that letter in the working languages of the Tribunal as soon as possible.  The Chamber appreciates the speediness with which the registry responded to this urgent request. 

The Chamber is of the view that any disclosure of the content of this document may prejudice the security and safety of the witness, as well as of his family, and that it is not appropriate that this document be disclosed to any party in the current proceedings or any other proceedings before the Tribunal, unless otherwise decided by the Chamber. 
The Chamber is satisfied that this measure, necessitated by exceptional circumstances, and taken pursuant to Rule 75 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, is consistent with the rights of the Accused.  The Chamber, therefore, requests the registry to archive this letter and its translation under seal and as highly confidential, to be accessible to the Chamber exclusively. 

This is our oral decision.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson and Mr. Witness, we think that the witness could be asked to provide Rwandan judicial -- could be maybe asked about information provided to Rwandan judicial authorities.  Now, with the proviso, though, that the witness should be at liberty to indicate that such communication could jeopardise his security or security and safety of his family.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But the question could be reformulated in regard to the information to Rwandan judicial authorities.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Very well.  Mr. President, you indicated yesterday that you thought that the witness had provided some sort of list in response to my question.  Is that not the case?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I was looking at a document in a language I cannot read. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I realise that.  If that is the case, I was going to ask maybe that part of the document can be disclosed, but if it's not the case, then I understand.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  So, Witness HH, we're going to take this matter very slowly and carefully, and we're going to try to accomplish what needs to be accomplished without compromising your security.  

So, you recall that yesterday you were asked to provide a list of the instances in which you were interviewed by Rwandan judicial authorities, including the approximate date and the name of the person in whose dossier or file you were being questioned.  And, apparently, you didn't do that exactly per our instructions, so now we're going to try to accomplish that.  
MR. ROBINSON:
So, I'd ask that the registry be asked to give the witness a piece of paper.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And together and very slowly we're going to compile this information in a way in which it's accessible to us but not to the public.  Do you understand? 
A.	Before a piece of paper is given to me, I must say that I am satisfied with the manner in which the presiding Judge of this Chamber has just responded to my query.  

Now, concerning other documents you are asking me to prepare, I am not ready to give them to him.  If the President just responded to my wish, I don't see why I have to be requested once again to prepare other documents.  So I can't understand why the attorney is asking me, once again, to prepare some other document.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we are -- I thought you had -- I thought you were listening to me as well.  What we had authorised was something a bit different to what happened yesterday.  We authorised the -- you see, the -- your judicial records -- your Rwandan judicial records are material which is admissible before the Trial Chamber.  

Now, I understood that what the counsel was asking you about was about, not your own judicial records, but about the files of other persons in respect of whom you had been -- you had provided information.  Now, we had thought that that question, information you gave to the judicial authorities, could be asked of you, but we also specified that you could indicate whether giving any of that information would jeopardise your security or the security of your family.  

So we did authorise the question, and, if you like, I could ask the question of you, that in relation to the information provided about other people to the judicial authorities of Rwanda, except as I have mentioned, if there are any such cases that would jeopardise your security if you would reveal that information. 

The point is you can express yourself orally as well.  You don't have to write it down.  
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Mr. President.  If you are asking me to say it orally that I passed through this place or I passed through this other place, well, I think that is easy.  I can comply with the orders of the Chamber.  So I can tell you that I met with the authorities of the Kigali prosecution department.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question involved a bit more than that.  You met the authorities of the Kigali prosecution department.  Could you give an indication of how many times and the occasions when that occurred?  
THE WITNESS:
More than once.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have an idea -- can you give us an idea of the time frame, the dates when that occurred?  
THE WITNESS:
I didn't note the dates.  I can't remember the dates. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you inform us of the persons about whom you were questioned?  
THE WITNESS:
They asked me questions regarding my conduct.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Witness. 

Mr. Robinson, you can continue.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you for that effort, Mr. President.  I think I have to go a little further, as you might be able to understand.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness HH, what I would like you to do is think about the very first time that you met with the authorities -- Rwandan judicial authorities about a case other than your own case, and when you're thinking about that, maybe you could tell us approximately what year that was, the very first time that the authorities questioned you about someone else's case, not your own.  
A.	Counsel, what I would like to ask you is that you better put questions to me regarding the matter which is of concern to us now.  Perhaps you may also ask me questions regarding my trial in Rwanda.  But regarding testimonies in other trials, I have told you that I cannot answer them.  However, I acknowledge that I had met with Rwandan authorities, but I am not going to divulge to you the contents of our discussions, more so because I have told you that I want it to be kept a secret.  But you yourself, when you don't want me to be privy to something, you ask me to take off my headsets.  So now I do have certain things I don't want you to hear. 
(Pages 12 to 20 by Sherri Knox)












1645H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	That is fair enough, Witness.  If I took off my headset would you advise the Trial Chamber of the cases in which you provided information?  I'm happy to take off my headset; I can read the transcript later.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, the witness's response is quite clear; I think we should move on.  Quite frankly, this procedure takes a lot of time.  I voiced concern about it.  It is not appropriate to conduct investigations during the witness's examination.  We do this with every witness.  And this witness has just demonstrated that he is a bit more assertive than others, but all witnesses express discomfort with this portion of Mr. Robinson's cross-examination.  And I think the Court should take note of that.  And my suggestion is that we move on to substantive matters.  

There are other ways -- well, I don't want to take the Court's time with more commentary, but I think we can come back to this issue at another time when a witness is not on the stand. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, you know the history of our efforts to obtain from Rwandan judicial authorities the material that this Trial Chamber has held is very important to witness credibility, and the efforts we have made to ask the Prosecutor to obtain this information.  And we now know that this information is not in the hands of the Defence, as it should be.  And we know that the Rwandan government takes the position that they are not going to provide any of this information to the Trial Chamber, despite binding orders that have been issued, without specific information that would allow it to locate those records.  And it is in that context that I am asking these questions.  And I have no other way of obtaining this information.  

And so I'm going to ask the witness again, now that he has heard my explanation, to tell us the first time, approximately what year he was contacted by Rwandan judicial authorities and asked questions about another case other than his own.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We think that the answers the witness has given conformed to the advice that I have given -- the Chamber had given him.  Although the word -- the words "safety" and "security" were not included in his answer, we are satisfied that these answers related to those issues.  And we have decided that in the interest of his security, and the security of his family, that the witness should not be compelled to make those disclosures.

Now, we were concerned also about the issue of fairness to the Accused and to the interest that they might have had in probing the extent to which the Prosecutor has discharged their disclosure obligations.  And that was, in fact, the issue that we had that caused us some concern.  But we think that, as we had said earlier, that the decision that we have taken is not inconsistent with the rights of the Accused.  And we are satisfied that this would be the proper way to exercise our discretion at this time with regard to these questions.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President, may the witness be asked to take off his headphones, because I would like to make a motion at this time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, well, I should add that the witness has agreed to answer questions related to his own judicial records and to information provided in relation to the Accused in the trial, in this trial; we have noted that.  

Now, Mr. Witness, you have been asked to remove your headset for communications to which you should not be privy. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, the situation that we now find ourselves in is that the         Trial Chamber has ruled on several occasions in the past that prior statements of witnesses to the authorities in Rwanda are important materials for the trial, not only for the Defence but for the 
Trial Chamber itself, in assessing the witness's credibility.  And by the ruling that you have now made, you are denying both us and yourselves access to this information.  And I would remind you that the Appeals Chamber in the Musema case has held that the rights of the Accused are the first consideration, and the need to protect victims and witnesses is a secondary one. 

And so I think you have to go further to try to find a solution to how this information, which you have acknowledged is extremely relevant and important to the fairness of the trial, can be obtained at the same time as the witness's interest can be maintained.  And I have some suggestions for you in terms of the motion. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
On a point of correction, you see, we have not acknowledged that the particular information from the question you asked is relevant.  We have -- we have actually concerned -- considered the -- we have considered that it was -- we didn't really want to get into the discussion of relevance, but that was a major issue that we were discussing.  And we are not satisfied that it is relevant. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Then perhaps I could put some more questions to the witness about the content of those statements, then we can determine what events he has discussed so you can make a determination as to whether the material he discussed on those occasions is relevant to the events that he has given testimony at this trial.  Would you like me to do that?  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, that is the enquiry that we wanted -- we thought that there was enough information for us to decide.  We did not want to allow further interrogation of this witness on relation to enquiries made into other people's cases.  You see, the statements you made concerning the Accused, the statement he made concerning himself, we will permit full enquiry into those.  And I think we will explain that to the witness in due course. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
But the problem is, Mr. President, for example, he may well have made statements concerning sending people for military training or not; about distributing weapons to Interahamwe --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that is his case. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, that can be made in the case of a subordinate or a superior, of lots of people.  There were hundreds of people he claims were involved in those.  That is not necessarily his case or the Accused.  So, the question is -- you can't say something is irrelevant if it wasn't mentioned in his own case or in the case of the three Accused.  There are many things that are relevant to his direct testimony.  He's covered a span of events from 1992 to 1994.  And for you -- you can't conclude that those things are not relevant and at the same time prohibit me from enquiring to try to demonstrate that they are.  

But the problem is that you are creating two problems for -- number one, he doesn't want to give the information to me.  So what you are doing is you are sanctioning this witness deciding who he wants to give the information to and who he doesn't; that is wrong.  Maybe Mr. Nzirorera should have another lawyer who would be more palatable to the witness so he could have the information that he needs to have a fair trial.  I don't think we want to set that kind of precedent. 

Secondly, maybe there are other alternatives to try to obtain this information without simply denying us, stopping us stone cold.  For example, maybe the Trial Chamber could take the information from the witness and transmit it to the judicial authorities in Rwanda and shepherd that request so that the records that we are entitled to can be provided without me having knowledge of what the witness has exactly said in his communication to the Trial Chamber.  I don't like that, but that certainly is a measure that can be taken rather then stopping us completely short of obtaining information that is relevant to his credibility.  And the fact is that what the Trial Chamber has done is closed the door on us obtaining relevant information.

Now, another thing you can do is you can order the Rwanda judicial authorities to search their records for any statements made by this witness to them in other dossiers.  You are not -- you haven't been willing to do that; so you've blocked that door for us.  So you are telling us that you want to be -- you are considering the rights of the Accused, but there are many alternatives in which you can balance the rights of the Accused against the obstinate refusal of this witness to give the information while I am present and listening.  And I think that this is a real error on the part of the Trial Chamber, and it is seriously affecting the fair trial rights of Mr. Nzirorera.  

So, I am making a motion that you consider alternative ways of obtaining this information and having it provided to the Defence.  Thank you.  
(Pages 21 to 24 by Donna M. Lewis)






























1715H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Before I get to, you know, my response to Mr. Robinson, I was actually a bit concerned about the latter portion of the Court's comments before Mr. Robinson made his motion in terms of the Prosecutor -- the Prosecutor's discharge of his disclosure obligations.  So I was wondering if the Court could clarify what its concerns were to that effect so I could respond with respect to Mr. Robinson.  

With respect to this witness, we've made efforts for the last three years to obtain his judicial records in Rwanda.  I have a memorandum prepared by the senior legal advisor in Kigali which documents the number of times that he went personally to the Rwandan ministry of justice to -- to get files from this witness.  Our efforts started in 2003, I believe.  Even as of last week, the Prosecutor himself undertook a mission to Rwanda and spoke personally to the prosecutor general there about our request for the judicial records of this witness and his statements in other cases.  There's a letter to that effect of the 3rd of November, where this witness is specifically mentioned.  

We make another request in order to obtain any statements that he has made in any other case.  So I'm not quite sure what the Chamber was alluding to, but in terms of our efforts to secure every possible record from this witness, we have made best efforts in every regard to provide this Chamber and the -- the Defence with -- with those -- those materials. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but, Mr. Webster, I can clarify what I said.  I didn't think it was an allusion.  We -- we are concerned that the Prosecutor will discharge the obligations to make full disclosure.  And although you have expressed your -- your -- you've made applications to curtail the cross-examination of witnesses on their prior judicial records, we have permitted the cross-examination on that issue as a means of allowing the Defence to probe the extent to which the disclosure obligations were -- were discharged.  Now, what we are saying is that, in relation to this particular question that we asked, we considered whether that was an issue which should have affected the -- our -- our ruling on this matter.  

Now, you have provided information which we did not have, and if you are saying now that you have made -- you have an ongoing enquiry into obtaining the records about which Mr. Robinson is enquiring, maybe you can assist in settling this problem by giving information about the enquiries that you have been making, the results of those enquiries, and -- and then we can see whether anything further is required, whether the assistance of the Chamber is required or any further steps are -- would be required.  And that would, in fact, address at least a major part of the concerns that counsel has been raising.  
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.  I would think that by Monday morning I can provide the Court with copies of a letter that was delivered to Rwandan authorities and a trail of email correspondence, where we've tried to follow up on this matter in particular.  So we've discharged our very best efforts in terms of trying to find this particular bit of information for the Defence and for the -- the needs of this -- the examination of this witness.  

But beyond that -- we'll do that, Your Honour, but I'm also -- I would also draw to the Court's attention the jurisprudence of this Tribunal that -- the most recent articulation of it that I have found is in the Bagosora trial.  I think it's a decision of the 6th of October of this year, where it repeats decisions of the Appeals Chamber, that the Prosecutor is not under an obligation to search out materials that we do not have.  

We have made all the efforts that we can make in order to obtain these materials.  If they are not forthcoming, that should not prevent us from going forward with the examination of this witness.  The Defence does not have an absolute right to every statement this witness has made in any location.  We make our effort -- our very best efforts to locate it, but if these statements are not forthcoming, that should not prevent us from going forward with this witness -- this witness's examination.  So that's really our concern.  We do the best that we can, but ultimately the wheels of justice have to turn, and this should not be an impediment to taking the type of testimony from this witness that this Court would find probative on the issues that we address in this trial.  

So I'll follow the Court's instructions.  We have done what we can.  I will produce documentation of the latest efforts in -- in -- in that regard.  But I take note of the hour, and we've spent the last 30 minutes or so on this one issue, and we haven't -- Mr. Robinson hasn't even begun to use the materials that have already been disclosed from the Rwandan authorities in regard to this witness.  

We've already disclosed at least a dozen Rwandan -- Rwandan judicial records in regard to this witness, and I haven't heard a single one being used to cross-examine him.  So on the one hand I understand the interest of the Defence and their right to seek out this material, but, as a practical matter, how helpful is it for us to pursue this red herring, which is documents in Rwanda that the Defence hardly uses once they arrive in his possession?  

We've gone through this exercise with a number of other witnesses and have gone through delays of this nature with a number of other witnesses.  And if the Court reflects on how that material has ultimately been used in this trial, I think that we'd all come to the realisation that it has not been very helpful in terms of moving the proceedings forward.  

So that's my concern.  We make our best efforts.  I'll provide the documentation to the Chamber, and I hope that will allow us to move forward.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow beat you to it, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm sorry. 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I merely wish to -- to take -- speak in support of Counsel Robinson's request because the Rwandan judicial records are indispensable for the defendants to be able to test the witness's credibility.  If problems of protection or the witness's safety are raised, what prevents us hearing him in a closed session?  We need to know what he has stated so that the Chamber can know what it is and weigh it.  Nothing prevents us from going into closed section -- session if problems of the witness's safety arise. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, without wishing to prolong the debate, which I have been following since yesterday, I reserve the possibility to speak at one point, or I can clearly formulate my position in the face of the refusal of this witness to answer the questions which are -- albeit very simple, that are put to him.  

It is not my judicial culture, this practice of examination-in-chief and cross-examination, which is why I have waited before speaking.  And I am quite troubled that, in the face of the answers given to this problem, it is the fairness that the Accused must find (unintelligible) the manner in which the proceedings proceed, which is, on the one hand, rendered difficult and, secondly, it is intolerable that a lawyer does his work, but then we say that the lawyer is doing his work very badly, in a tendentious manner.  

My learned friend and colleague, Counsel Robinson, has recalled the importance there is for us, the significance, and you, yourself, have acknowledged that, Mr. President, to have this -- these materials from Rwanda concerning the Prosecutor's witness.  And we cannot go on avoiding the subject by targeting the work of the lawyers as though it was they who had to answer the questions.  The role of each one here is well defined, and you have explained what it is.  

So this is the thought I should like to bring to this debate so that we might find a way of moving forward whilst preserving the fairness guaranteed to the Accused in their trials -- in their respective trials. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I won't prolong the debate, given the hour, so I think it's a big problem.  I think there are other motions that will have to follow from this if we're not able to make progress, and I think at this point I would ask you to rule on my motion to find alternative means to give us this information while protecting the rights of this witness.  I ask you to rule on that before we have to go forward. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, there has been -- an interim step has been taken.  The Prosecutor has indicated that he has been doing just that.  And he has undertaken to provide information to the Chamber so that we can examine the steps that he has taken, and then we will see what was needed from that.  It may very well be that the Court may make the sort of order that you have proposed.  But, in the circumstances, what the Prosecutor said, it seemed reasonable to inspect the steps that have already been taken before making another step.  

You see, we had not been aware from the Chamber that it has been established that there has been any -- any breach of prosecutorial obligations of disclosure in this case.  That is part of the issue that we have considered.  We are aware of the disclosures of the Rwandan judicial records of this witness, and there is -- and so we have seen the disclosures in that regard.  

Now -- but I think that's enough said for now, but -- but I think that we have made an interim order -- an interim ruling on the request that you have made by asking the Prosecutor to show information -- to inform us of the steps taken to get information that he says he has taken.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I think to be clear, the Prosecutor has already informed you of many, many steps that he has taken in -- to obtain the records of this particular witness.  And I think you have -- if you look through the filings that have already been made -- extensive memorandum by a gentleman named Mohammed Ayat, legal officer in Kigali, who, in fact, had this very file of the witness in his hand.  And when he -- it was promised that he would be given that file -- the copies of that file, and then it disappeared.  And the Rwandan authorities have told him that they can't find those records anymore.  And that's been going on, I think, for over a year.  

So the problem is not with the Prosecutor in this particular instance.  The problem is with the Rwandan authorities.  And what you -- what hasn't been addressed is that you've created a -- a impossible situation where the Rwandan -- you won't compel the Rwandan authorities to produce the records, and you won't compel the witness to give the information the Rwandan authorities are requiring in order to produce them.  

So you put a complete -- instead of providing all of the facilities necessary for the ascertainment of the truth and the assistance of the Defence, which is required by the statute, you've set up a complete roadblock to obtaining the information.  And I'm asking you to unclog the roadblock by one or two -- of two means:  Insist that the witness provide the information, even to the Trial Chamber, confidentially, if necessary, so you can get the records for us; or, order the Rwandan government to provide the records with the description that they have and make the kind of effort that they seem to have not been willing to make.  

And you have the power to do both of those things, and you're -- you're doing none of them.  That's my problem.  And it's not the problem of the Prosecutor.  I think the Prosecutor in this instance has done what he could to get these records.  And Mr. Webster's also acknowledged that there are records that they clearly don't have for this witness, that haven't been provided by the Rwandan government.  

So waiting for the Prosecutor is not solving our problem.  And I've asked that you make a ruling because I don't want to go forward until this issue is resolved because there's other problems that I see in connection with my cross-examination that are going to ensue if we don't have some relief.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  We will take the adjournment now.  

We'll take the adjournment now, the -- and resume tomorrow morning.  
(Court adjourned at 1735H)
