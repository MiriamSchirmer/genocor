P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Good morning everyone.  

The Trial Chamber recalls that the Prosecution case was closed yesterday.  And it is holding a 
status conference in accordance with Rule 65 bis of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  

We will begin in open session and we will go in and out of this session, depending on what matter is being addressed.  

May we now have the appearance of the parties, please.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
May it please the Court.  The appearance for the Prosecutor is as before.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.  

Defence? 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  The Defence team is composed today by 
Philippe Larochelle; Nathalie Leblanc; Erik Sullivan; Célestin Kagango; Élise Le Gall; 
Vincent Larochelle, and myself, lead counsel, Vincent Courcelle-Labrousse.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.  

We have been informed by the registry that a witness -- a protected witness who has a request is around.  We, therefore, wish to begin with that issue, so that the witness doesn't have too long to wait.  If the registry could arrange to bring the witness in, and also arrange to go in closed session for that reason, because the discussion might disclose the identity of the witness.  

Members of the public, we regret you have to leave now.  We will not take long in this closed session.  You can always come back when we revert to the open session. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 2 to 9] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

MR. MWAMASANGULA:
We are in open session, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Thank you, Registry.  

Witness Protection Officer, we still need you around, at least until the next item has been disposed of.  And we also have a further query regarding the matter we have discussed.  After that, we will let you know when you can leave.  If you could bear with us.  

Yes.  The Trial Chamber would like to begin with -- by addressing -- the Trial Chamber wishes to begin by making the following observations.  

On the 26th of March 2010, the Trial Chamber issued a decision termed, "Consolidated Decision on Prosecutor's Second and Third Motions to Compel Defence to comply with Trial Chamber Decision of 3rd February 2010".  In paragraph 21 of that decision, the Trial Chamber recalls that it ordered the striking out of the following witnesses:  T75; T152; T130; T23; Suzanne Thomson and Fernand Batard from the list of prospective Defence witnesses for lack of identifying information.  The Trial Chamber further noted that if the Defence wanted to pursue the issue of the inclusion of these witnesses on its list, it had to raise this through a formal motion.  

Now, the Trial Chamber observes that some of the witnesses that it ordered to be struck out are included on a list of 44 witnesses, actual and potential witnesses.  

Now, in this respect, the Trial Chamber wishes to further observe that the Defence was ordered to file within five days, which were to expire on the 31st of March, a revised and significantly reduced witness list that is proportionate and commensurate to that of the Prosecution and does not exceed 
30 witnesses.  It also ordered the criterion that should be followed in filing the personal identification sheets of each of these witnesses.  The Trial Chamber notes that the provisions of this decision have not been followed by the Defence and it would like an explanation from the Defence in this regard.  

Defence Counsel? 
 
But maybe before that, the Prosecution, if it has any submissions in this regard, it could make the submissions so that the Defence responds once on this matter.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Madam President, we'll not make a submission at this point.  

MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Prosecution.  

Defence Counsel? 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Madam President, with regard to the case of Suzanne Thomson and Fernand Batard, we have taken due note of your decision -- or your ruling, in that there was a lack of a simple, formal element.  This is an identification sheet which needed to be included for the Defence witnesses.  In order to remedy this shortcoming -- this initial shortcoming, as such that the restriction ordered by the Chamber which was not a restriction on the merit given the witnesses themselves, but this was due to the fact that the identification sheets were not annexed and the remedy has been effected.  

We did not understand your ruling to mean that it was necessary to submit to Your Chamber a 
formal motion, whereas, we have complied implicitly with your ruling, so that we have included in the list of Defence witnesses the 30 that you have allowed us to present.  At the moment, these are people who the Defence believes that, in the interests of justice, they must testify within the framework of this trial.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Counsel, that is one leg of what we wanted an explanation about.  There is the list of 
44 witnesses.  We would like an explanation on that one as well.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Very well, Madam President, Your Honours.  

You have made a ruling regarding the number of witnesses the Trial Chamber thought, at the time when it was rendering that decision, to be appropriate to allow the Defence to present within the framework of the Prosecution of Callixte Nzabonimana.  The Chamber is aware that this decision was following a motion for review and certification.  

In a few words, these motions have been discussed verbally with the Prosecutor.  Initially, at trial the Prosecutor accused -- alleged that Callixte Nzabonimana was responsible for 58 allegations or offences and each allegation might require that we determine to know whether Callixte Nzabonimana in the same sequence of one day was in several places -- several different places at the same time.  The indictment was the amended indictment of October 2008.  For one year we have been working on these 58 criminal allegations.  

And to speak to you about the past, I need to say that some of these allegations were quite considerable in their nature because if Callixte Nzabonimana was alleged to have participated in 
1991, 1992, 1993 and 1994 during the genocide, attended political meetings of national scope in Rwanda with various political leaders, these are allegations which were unilaterally and magically abandoned or set aside without any explanation by the Prosecutor of the Tribunal in the space of 
one year.  

Your Honours, the mere fact of being accused of a criminal offence, which can be qualified as genocide or crimes against humanity, this is something which is extremely serious for an individual.  And the mere fact of setting aside those allegations would justify that the Office of the Prosecutor, if you're dealing with responsible persons, to explain why, after having submitted to you an indictment accusing a person of 50 plus allegations, they are abandoned suddenly.  Eleven are abandoned, including matters dealing with important meetings, according to the Prosecutor.  

And to bring a poor historical parallel, I don't know, it has been said that maybe Callixte Nzabonimana was at the Yalta conference and he had said such-and-such things and he was being accused.  And then later on the Prosecutor says that we are setting aside those allegations but we're not told why the 
Prosecutor of the Tribunal has included these 11 allegations.  And it seems like we are dealing with profit and loss, because in the -- we are dealing with Callixte Nzabonimana as being a 
préfet of Gitarama.  

Today, there are 47 criminal allegations.  Today there are 47 criminal allegations which are still being maintained by the Prosecution in the indictment.  In other words, at the time -- as we speak, 
Mr. Ng'arua is still accusing Callixte Nzabonimana of having committed 47 offences which can each be identified and qualified as genocide and crimes against humanity.  The Prosecutor has not set aside the allegations he made.  So for us it is obvious that a man who is to be prosecuted for the most 
serious crimes -- of crimes in the order of crimes, and this is before an International Tribunal, the Prosecution must, as a minimum, present -- the Accused must present at least one witness for each of the allegations.  I have 47 different dates, at different places and times where I am accused of having done such-and-such a thing.  

You cannot deprive an accused of the possibility to present at least one witness for each of these allegations.  You have reduced our ability to present witnesses to 30 witnesses, whereas, the 
47 allegations are maintained in the indictment. 
(Pages 10 to 12 by Rebecca McCoy) 





1115H 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE (continued): 
The logical reason is quite -- reasoning would be quite simple.  In other words, there are 17 allegations for which we will be unable to present witnesses, because the Prosecutor is maintaining these allegations in his indictment.  He has not, for the time being, said to you that I am setting aside 
such-and-such an allegation.  He has not done that.  

And if we were to come back to the balance between an allegation and a witness, the Defence would go as far as even supporting the fact that we need to have a congruous proportionality, because it would, therefore, presume that each of the witnesses to be presented will be able at the same scene which -- or, an incident which took place during one day, but maybe also in two different places.  
This would mean that each Defence witness will be able to be an omniscient witness, who will be able to answer to the fullness of having been a witness to the totality of the events entailed in the allegations against the Accused.

The problem, Madam President, Your Honours, is that contrary to the Prosecution, the Defence cannot have omniscient, and all knowing witnesses who know everything, who have seen everything, and which is able to follow the Accused like a fly on a horse throughout the day that horse is travelling or at various times during the day, such as is implied by the Prosecution.  We cannot have the possibility of being able to demonstrate our innocence, demonstrate that we are not guilty of the allegations that are drawn up in a unilateral manner by the Prosecution.  We would not be able to prove our 
evidence -- corroborate our evidence, not only factually speaking, but we also have to corroborate our evidence in respect of the credibility of Prosecution witnesses, whom we intend to reduce to nothing, because in our evidence we are going not only to demonstrate that Callixte Nzabonimana was not in Nyabikenke at the time when he was accused of having been there.  We are going to demonstrate to you that each of the Prosecution witnesses are false witnesses, witnesses that are providing 
false testimony, because, despite their status, they were prepared either in Nyabikenke or 
Rwandan prisons, and a preparation which is destined as the Rwandan minister of justice is continually 
showing -- telling that we have to provide good witnesses and that if you don't believe the minister, the witness is there to tell you.  And he is saying that the Tribunal is only a legal or judicial theatre.  

So, we have the right to fully defend ourselves against all allegations made by the Prosecution and limiting the number of Defence witnesses to 30, you are depriving us of that right.  Let me give you an example -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So, we are sorry to interrupt you, but the question we asked was a simple one.  We are aware that you have filed a motion to address that issue, which the Trial Chamber is considering.  What we want to know is why you went against the specific orders of the Chamber which were clear and unambiguous.  That is all we ask.  We are addressing that motion and if it is made out, we will make the necessary orders.  You are aware that that motion has been filed.

The proper course of action for any counsel to take is normally -- and this is also demanded by courtesy and court decorum -- is to comply with the orders of the Trial Chamber.  And after you have complied with the orders of the Trial Chamber, then you can put your case and the Trial Chamber can listen.  But flouting court orders does not assist in advancing these proceedings.  That is the point we want to make. 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Madam President, I am here to defend a man who is running the risk of life imprisonment.  So I am trying to be cautious as much as is possible with the Chamber, but my rules -- the rules of my profession require that I tell you what I have to tell you.  

With regard to the list of 44 witnesses, we have provided a list which includes a part which is in bold letters and which corresponds to the list of 30 witnesses that the Chamber has asked us to comply with.  So you have that list of the 30 witnesses and we have in non-bold lettering, included 14 other witnesses whom we would wish the Chamber to allow us to present.  So, the list is a list which, of its reading at face value, has a mixed bag of witnesses.  We have the 30 witnesses which you have allowed us to present, and that is the part in bold on our list.  And the part which is in normal letters are the 
14 witnesses that we wish to add.  

Now, to be able to make maximum use of the Chamber's work and time, we have tried to provide a kind of schedule which is one that is modifiable, depending on your ruling.  If you are saying, "No, Counsel", we are going to maintain and stick to the 30 witnesses," well, we will have the 30 witnesses who appear in bold letters.  But if you finally provide us the 44 witnesses that we are asking you to present, you already have in hand the schedule that we are proposing.  So, please do not consider this as a discourtesy on our part.  But we have tried to show to the Tribunal what we are proposing -- that what we are proposing is possible, given the organisation of the sessions -- and should be even more so possible because the week that we were supposed to have a break in the last week of April, has been removed, and this clearly demonstrates that we have time enough to present these witnesses.  

So, it is only by anticipation and not pre-empting what you would be saying -- but we are trying to show that we would be able to organise ourselves in this manner and that it is possible.  Let me just indicate to you in relation to another trial in the Kalimanzira case, where the Defence was given a similar 
time frame or even a shorter time frame, the Accused only had 17 allegations and he was able to present 43 witnesses -- 43 witnesses.  So 17 allegations and 47 witnesses.  
Today, I am having a former minister of Rwanda and my client has been accused -- has been charged with 47 allegations, and I am only allowed to present 30 witnesses. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

This is the ruling of the Trial Chamber on this matter:  The Trial Chamber's orders in paragraphs 21 and the orders that followed were very clear and specific, and the Trial Chamber regrets that counsel could not understand them as such.  That order, the Trial Chamber would like to reiterate, stands.  

If Defence counsel is minded to adjust its list to include the people who were struck off from the list or include any others, then it must raise a formal motion, and not in an oblique fashion, the way it has been done by filing the list and given the explanations that it has made.  The motion must be filed with proper justifications for inclusion of the witnesses and the Trial Chamber will make its decision accordingly.  

In future, the Trial Chamber would like to say that it expects full compliance with its orders, as this saves court time.  The order, as it stands in paragraph 21 of that decision of 26 March 2010, and the orders that were made, stand.  Therefore, the list of witnesses which is valid, according to the Chamber, excludes the witnesses who were struck off and any others who may be -- have been added without the sanction of the Chamber.  That is the ruling of the Trial Chamber.  

The Trial Chamber will now move on to the proofing chart which was filed by the Defence.  The 
Trial Chamber has noted that this proofing chart contains a list of 154 witnesses, and it has been difficult for the Chamber to understand what this proofing chart is all about.  

Defence counsel -- and before perhaps you make any submissions, if the Prosecution has any 
matter -- any matter to submit in this regard, it should do so, but we would also like to hear 
Defence counsel on this matter.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Madam President, I would request that the Prosecutor submit after the Defence counsel, because the matter is really in the Defence counsel's court.  And if there is anything to respond to, we request the indulgence that we respond to after the Defence counsel has made its submissions.  As the Court pleases.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay, Defence Counsel. 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
That proofing chart, Madam President, Your Honours, is to indicate to you the witnesses who will be available and necessary at best to be able to counter the 47 criminal allegations made against 
Callixte Nzabonimana. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, our order was to submit a proofing chart regarding those witnesses who were allowed to testify.  So we are baffled by the number of the witnesses who appear there, and we cannot make head and tail of this chart. Therefore, no assistance has been rendered to the Chamber in this regard.  

Prosecution.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My Lords, we completely agree with the Chamber.  We were also baffled by that proofing chart.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel. 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
I do not quite understand your question.  You have the list -- the chart of 157 or so witnesses detailing the allegations made by the Prosecution, facts on which the witnesses might be coming to testify, allegations that would be contradicted by the witnesses, the time we shall need for each of these witnesses, the 30 witnesses, now 28, that the Trial Chamber has granted us are, of course, in that list, but in advance and to facilitate the job of the Prosecutor, because we also disclosed the 
witness statements when they gave the statements.  The Trial Chamber has all the Defence witnesses who will be willing to come and testify on which subject in particular and against which 
Prosecution witness.  I believe this is an extremely useful working tool both for the Trial Chamber, as well as for the Prosecution. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Defence Counsel.  

This is the decision of the Trial Chamber with regard to the matter of the proofing chart:  The 
Trial Chamber recalls its decision made in the pre-trial conference -- pre-Defence conference held on the 5th of March 2010, in which it urged the Defence to reduce its witness list.  

The Trial Chamber also further recalls its decision of 26th March 2010, in which it ordered the Defence to file a witness list containing no more than 30 witnesses.  

The Trial Chamber would like -- therefore, like to direct the Defence to file a revised proofing chart with names and pseudonyms of witnesses, who met the requirements of the 26th of March 2010 decision by the end of business tomorrow, the 15th of April 2010.  And the proofing chart should include only those witnesses who meet the requirements stated in that decision, in terms of all the requirements stated in that decision, paragraph 21 and the order thereof.  

The next issue the Trial Chamber would like to broach is the issue of disclosure.  Prosecution -- maybe before we hear from the Prosecution, from our own reading of the material so far disclosed, the 
Trial Chamber notices that 22 of the witnesses are missing birth dates.  One witness has no year of birth at all and there are no explanations given for these omissions.   

If the Prosecution would like to submit now or prefer to hear -- for the Trial Chamber to hear from the Defence first, it should so indicate now.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My Lords, we would like first the Defence to give its position and we respond. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Sorry, Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
It would appear to me that these issues had been reviewed, Madam President.  If the witnesses have a known date of birth, which is not always the case, but we shall verify that, but we believe that all those lists had been revised with the new information that we have. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Prosecution Counsel. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Just request a minute to consult. 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
After some more information, let me tell the Trial Chamber that we revised the list depending on the information that we have available to us. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Thank you, Counsel.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My Lords, when we looked at the issue of disclosures, we found that it was fairly complicated and we'd request, My Lords, that you give us until close of business tomorrow to file with all the parties, including the Court, all the problems we have found with regard to your previous ruling about the details that should be given in the revised -- in the -- in the list of -- of disclosures.  If the Court can indulge us, we'll be able to do that and make a comprehensive list of these matters.  As the Court pleases.  

MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
I would like to say something.  We have understood that we do not have much time.  So we would like to start our case as soon as possible.  I am somewhat surprised that the Prosecutor is raising a problem, the scope of which he doesn't understand.  We disclosed -- we've made disclosures.  If he had any problem with identity, we were willing -- we were available, we would have enlightened him if he had any problems with the identities of any of the witnesses.  So I do not see what justifies the fact that he is not ready today to present any problems he has.  Some of our witnesses are already here.  We accepted that there should be no interruption between the Prosecution case and the Defence case.  Two witnesses appeared during the period that was allocated for the Defence.  So the Prosecution's requests are making us lose time when it comes to our own appearances of our own witnesses.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Thank you, Counsel.  But so that we are clear on how we are going to proceed in the future on all sides -- or, let's wait for each other to finish whatever we are doing before we address each other.  

So, the Trial Chamber was deliberating, and it will now continue to deliberate and issue a ruling on -- in this regard, unless the Prosecution has anything more to say.  

Defence Counsel, you came in while we were still deliberating, and it would have been preferred if you had waited until we finished.  

Prosecution, do you have anything further to say, because we want to make our decision now?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
We have made an index of further PIS forms that had not been properly done.  The first one was with respect to T113.  We found that in that -- in that PI -- in that PIS, we do not have a date of birth and we did not have an address in 1994.  

Now, with respect to T -- with respect to T7, we do not have details of parents -- the parents' details and we do not have a secteur of birth.  

Now, with respect to -- with respect to T34 -- with respect to T34, there is no place of birth, there is no cellule of birth.  

And with respect to T33, there is no cellule and no address in 1994.  

With respect to T36, there is no place of birth, no cellule of birth and no address or cellule of -- of 
1994 cellule.  

Again, with respect to T31, there is no cellule of birth, and this is something that the witness can easily give to the Defence.  That was denied us.  

And with respect to T6, there are no details of parents, and with respect to place of birth, no cellule, 
no secteur and no commune of birth.  

My Lords, we acknowledged that we had many problems with the list, and I still think that there is 
time -- there is need for us to refine this list even further.  We already have a tentative -- we already have a tentative list.  And we just want again to go back to Chambers and double-check because there are problems and complicated problems, and then we can even give it to our learned friend and Chambers even earlier than we had earlier proposed so that it can be of better assistance to 
my learned friend about this thing.  

Now, we are not trying to delay trial, as my learned friend was saying, but really, there were issues with respect to this PIS that we need to very quickly refine.  But we do have a tentative list of the problems that -- that appear on the -- on the list and we will just request for a bit more time to refine it and send it to Chambers.  As the Court pleases.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel, briefly, please.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
I have control -- after looking at one of the lists, I have the impression that the Prosecutor is working on the one that was sent to him on the 31st of March, and that list has already been revised.  That is why 
I am somewhat surprised that since the 31st of March, if there were any problems, he did not inform us about them.  

I would also like to add that the name of the father and mother were not in your order -- were not required by you.  So, we would like the Prosecutor to verify the right list.  If he is working well, he should look at the right list and not the revised list that we sent to him on the 31st of March or before.  I believe all had been revised and that is why these elements were sent some 15 days ago.  I'm surprised and it's a pity that he is only raising this matter now.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Yes, like the Defence, the Trial Chamber is surprised that the Prosecution is not ready with the information that it considers not complete.  

The Trial Chamber is also of the view that this trial should not be delayed because of these problems.  We expect the Prosecution to be more diligent in future with regard to these issues, more so, as we announced in advance that we would be holding this status conference and it was clear that the trial would commence immediately after the close of the Defence (sic) case.  

What we would like to know from the Prosecution, have they failed to investigate any witness by reason of any lack of information?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Yes, My Lords, Witness T40 -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Maybe -- sorry to interrupt, but we expect you to be raising issues about the witnesses who are on the list in accordance with our order of 26th March. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Yes.  That's the one, My Lord, Yes.   

Witness T40, that is the only one that we are having a problem as a result of lack of disclosure of particulars. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And when is this witness scheduled to testify?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
This witness is scheduled to testify as number 10 between 19th and 23rd of April 2010. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence Counsel. 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Madam President, the Prosecutor must be specific.  He is saying that there is a problem, why?  We are looking at the list, if he has a general problem, that's another thing.  But we must know the reason for the problem he is having. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecution. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My Lords, the -- the -- the problems that we were having with the investigation of this thing are merely general, and it's a question of having not had sufficient time to investigate this particular witness.  

We have other problems with the investigation, but they do not relate to the question that you have asked.  I'm sure that you will give us an opportunity to address that matter later after your question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, the question we want to resolve is:  Has the failure or alleged failure of giving information by the Defence incapacitated you in any way by your investigation?  That is what we want to find out.  And if so, with respect of which witness and how. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
The only problem we have is with T40, and it's with respect to -- we didn't get a date of birth.  And in that cellule, we found at least three persons and of different age with the same name.  So, 
My Lords, that was the only problem with that one.  But it's more of a general nature, because we do have the -- the place of birth, but not the date of birth. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecutor.  

Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Madam President, Your Honours, we have disclosed to the Prosecution on the 22nd of February the statement of that witness.  He has his date of birth thereon, and he is very easily identifiable.  So I don't think there is any practical difficulty whatsoever.  We know where he lives, we know where he was born and his name.  All this is quite simple.  But I don't think that is the reality of the problem the Prosecutor seems to be having. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution, do you know who this witness is? 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My Lords, I do concede that the problem we are having with this witness is of a general nature, rather than a specific nature that the Defence can help us with.  But when we received the PIS initially, it did not have that detail.  So, subsequently, we have now gotten the -- the statement, and I think the problem will be resolved in the course of time.  This cannot delay us from -- from proceeding with the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

In this regard, then we will leave the rest of the problems to be dealt with by the parties, which should link communication channels open between themselves, and if there is any problem, the Trial Chamber can always be apprised.   We want -- yes.
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Madam President, we have a problem with that, in the sense that the other problem I wanted to mention to you with respect to delay in investigation arises out of a technicality, really, that the Defence have sprang on us.  

Now, in the previous order and list of appearance that was filed by the Defence on the 12th of March, has been one of the documents that we have been using to prioritise the investigation of witnesses.  Now, that list was given to us on the 12th of March, and it showed a certain order of appearance of witnesses, starting with T24, CMAO, T6, et cetera.  

Now, subsequently, we have now been given a list which is now going as the revised list of appearance, which does not reflect the order of appearance that was initially communicated to us, and upon which we had started acting.  So that is the difficulty in the investigation that this sort of thing springs upon us.  

Now that the Defence counsel have been asked to file a revised pre-proofing chart, we would implore the Court to insist on the proofing chart to reflect the 30 witnesses, as appears in the revised order of appearance, so as not to cause any further confusion and delay, because we prioritise within the short time we had, our investigations twice now, first, with the one of 12th of March, and, subsequently, we have now been following the list of order of appearance of 9th of April 2010.  

And now we were even shocked when my learned friend stood up a few -- a short while ago and said that he was going to further revise this list.  We want the Chamber to order the Defence to stick now to this list of the -- of the 9th of April 2010, with only one exception.  

We would request that the witness number 5 on that list, who I cannot mention because we are in 
open session, to be deferred to a later date because, previously, that witness was supposed to appear in week three, and her pseudonym is T59.  She was supposed to have appeared in the initial list in 
week three as witness number 32.  So, we'd request that rather than rely on the good offices of our both parties to communicate, that clearly, Defence counsel be held to that -- to that order.  This will facilitate that our investigations which are still ongoing to be meaningful.   As the Court pleases. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecution counsel.  

Defence Counsel. 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Madam President, Your Honours, I think that the Chamber is quite aware of Rule 73 bis of the 
Rules of Procedure and Evidence -- I beg your pardon, 73 ter, Ngirabatware.  In that trial, the Chamber reminded that the Defence could modify its witness list and that the Prosecutor could, indeed, modify or vary its list of witnesses and order of appearance without having to require a specific ruling by the Chamber before it presents its evidence.  And this is exactly the same situation in which we find ourselves today.  

Also the appearance order, which we had initially envisaged and which was later amended, did not constitute significant -- substantive amendment, but it take -- took into account several factors, the 
first point of which is, we needed not to sit in the third week, from the 23rd to the 29th April.  Therefore, we readopted ourselves immediately when, on Monday, we were provided with that information.  

Furthermore, and let me remind the Chamber that at this time in Rwanda, we are in the full thrust of the celebration of genocide and that this disturbed quite significantly the travel of witnesses, because various administrations are more or less paralysed throughout the week.  So for us to obtain papers from the Rwandan administration is a complicated process.

1215H 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE (continued): 
Furthermore, some witnesses -- as this was the case for the Prosecution, but the difference for him was that his evidence had already started -- he had already started presenting his witnesses.  So, for some witnesses who are in Rwanda or elsewhere, there are last-minute adjustments necessary due mainly to the commemoration in Rwanda, or for personal reasons the order of appearance had to be changed.  And this is why, indeed, we had to amend, but not substantively, our list, because we respected the initial order, given the fact that we were following some kind of logic in our presentation of witnesses.  We try as best we can to maintain that order so that the presentation of witnesses can follow a historical or chronological order, as far as is possible.  So, I don't see the Prosecution's problem concerning their investigations.  

As for the Prosecution, the Prosecution has been investigating for a period of 14 years in this case.  So he's in a better position than we are.  He has a greater striking force than we do.  That is the 
first point.  And then the second point is that, as provided and ordered by the Chamber, we provided all the information necessary for the Prosecution investigations.  So I don't see any reason -- I don't really see the submission being made by the Prosecution.  

The Defence evidence has not begun and the list is there providing the order of appearance, following the witnesses who are here, so that we do not lose time.  Please, we also note that there are witnesses from Europe who are also present.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Learned Counsel, if we may ask:  You filed a revised order of appearance of witnesses on the 9th of April 2010; is this the order of appearance that is being followed? 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Madam President, we had been obliged to slightly adjust ourselves, given the order of appearance, and this was because of changes in the scheduling which had occurred.  So, this order of appearance will be not substantially, but it will be the same witnesses who will be appearing in the first week, depending on their arrival, but the order will be slightly, slightly different. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Learned Counsel, the Prosecution needs to know, obviously because it has to investigate, but the Trial Chamber also needs to know.  So what is your order of appearance for this first week?  We want to have the order at least for the first three weeks of the appearance of witnesses.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Yes, I'm going to provide you with that -- or, I can submit it to you later.  Do you want me to provide a listing now? 

MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Well, we are scheduled to commence the Defence case this afternoon.  Yes, so we need to have this list as soon as possible.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
All right.  We will begin this afternoon with T5, followed by T6, followed by T19 -- T9. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Corrects counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
T9, followed by T19, 1-9, T59 and T33.  There you are for this week, Madam President.  

The second week, T24, T31, T27, T40, T57.  

The third week, which will only last three days, from my understanding, T25, T34, T71.  This will be it for the three weeks.  We have only placed three witnesses for the third mini week so that we can compensate for the -- any gaps that may have occurred in the previous weeks.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Defence Counsel.  

Prosecution. 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
I'm sorry, Your Honour.  Let me add that we have made amendments, because T19 and T53 and T33 were for the first week, and they have not arrived as yet.  Oh, they arrived this morning.  We had wanted to have them at the beginning of the week, but they arrived late, given the commemoration of the genocide, as I've already stated. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, thank you, Defence Counsel.  

Prosecution. 
MR. NG'ARUA:  
Sorry.  We had requested T59 to be moved to a subsequent date.  If they could do that, it would be appreciated. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Prosecution, we want to understand your submissions.  The order of appearance, as it appears, is okay for you except for the witness, T59, whom you would prefer to be moved to another date. 
MR. NG'ARUA:  
As the Court pleases.  That is what we want.  That was our previous submission to the Court.  

MADAM PRESIDENT:  
Yes.  And now, given that we have just one day and a few hours left of this week, in any event, he might not testify.  He's not likely to testify this week.  Would this give you sufficient time?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
No, I'm afraid not.  We would request this witness to be -- if the best position would have been in the third week to enable us to -- to carry out some investigation.  Next week would be too soon.  We had requested they be brought to the third week.  

As the Court pleases. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Defence Counsel, you have heard the request of the Prosecution.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
No, we cannot accept that request.  The Prosecutor has all the information regarding this witness, and he had them at the same time as all the other witnesses.  And this witness has only this week, this time, for he or she to be able to travel.  And the Prosecutor has no satisfactory reason for his request, that this witness be stood to later.  He's only asked this today.  The witness has arrived today, and it is absolutely necessary that he appear in court as scheduled.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Prosecution. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
But the witness had been scheduled for the third week, that's what we're saying.  And if, for instance, the Defence had listened to the Court's order and filed their list of 30 witnesses at the appropriate time, this confusion would not allow.  It can be seen as a strategy to overwhelm the Prosecutor with too many witnesses in a short time, and that is the problem we are having.  So, the order of call of these witnesses is as important as we have indicated it to be.  We recall very well and the Defence was very particular about the change of any witnesses during the Prosecution's phase of the trial.  Now, we are raising a specific issue and I think they should be able to accommodate us and at least bring this witness at least to the end of next week, if that is -- at the earliest, because they had previously indicated, and when we see a document from the Defence saying that in the first week so and so would be called and in the second week so and so would be called, we hold them to it with due respect, My Lords, and hope that is what they will do.  However, if there are some difficulties, we're willing to accept that and, in respect to this witness, at least call him towards the end of 
next week to allow us to do reasonable work.  As the Court pleases.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.  

Yes, very briefly, Learned Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Yes, let me remind the Prosecutor that he -- there has been only one witness who was set for later, and this was because the Prosecutor did not provide us with the necessary elements for disclosure.  So, that was the only postponement that had been allowed.  And let me recall that, initially, that witness was scheduled for Monday next week, and this is because -- and it was because he was not going to be able to be appearing next week that we have brought him forward to this week.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Maybe, as we await some information from our team, Defence Counsel, this witness was supposed to appear by Monday of next week, by which list?  Is it the order of appearance of 9th April? 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Yes, yes.  Let me -- let me just check on that, Madam President.  Is this the 9th of April? 
 
Yes, 9th of April, Madam President.  

On the 9th of April list, the witness was number 5 for that week -- this week -- cette semaine, this week.  And that was also the same in the list of 44 that we submitted on the 6th of April.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, this will be the ruling of the Trial Chamber:  The Trial Chamber notes from the revised order of appearance filed on the 9th of April that this witness was scheduled to testify this week.  However, as the Trial Chamber has already noted, this is not going to be possible in the light of the fact that we have one day and a few hours left, which makes it a reality that this witness will testify next week.  Given the problems that the Defence has outlined regarding the securing of this witness, we believe that the Prosecution can, between now and next week, when this witness testifies, do its best to finalise its investigations as it has had due notice of this since 9th April.  This witness will, therefore, testify next week, in accordance with the list which has been given to us -- the order of appearance that has just been given to us by the Defence.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
As the Court pleases. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Witness Protection Officer, we are really very sorry that we've kept you here for this long, but the problem has been that we wanted you to enlighten us on the problems that you faced in securing the attendance of these witnesses, if at all, and we also wanted the Prosecution to give us a clarification, because on our own we had a problem with a witness, T179 -- T179.  

First of all, is he still on the list?  And does the Prosecution have anything to say about this, which the witness protection might assist us to resolve?  We will hear from the witness protection officer.  Maybe, let's hear from the Prosecution first, before the officer responds, and then he will leave after that.  

We apologise, Witness Protection Officer.  

Prosecution, do you have any submissions to make with regard to this witness, 179?  And perhaps before you respond, Defence Counsel, is he on the list? 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
On the list of the 28th?  No, not for the time being.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
All right.  Then, in that case, we don't need to discuss this matter.  

Yes, Officer, any problems regarding the securing and attendance of witnesses?  And if you think we should go into closed session, please let us know.  
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:  
Madam President, Your Honours, I believe, as far as we are concerned, the most important issue has been resolved.  However, I would like to draw your attention to a specific matter.  Witness T6 -- and this is to corroborate what the Defence said a while ago concerning the constraints of the witnesses, the constraints of our section and also the constraints of the Defence.  If you allow me to repeat the expression, the witness has professional constraints and because of that can only be in Arusha during the time lapse authorised.  And beyond that time, he says he will not be able to continue to be here.  And that is why I needed to clarify the Chamber on this point.  As for T -- I think T59 has been extensively discussed, so I will not come back to that; the constraints are almost the same.  As for the problems related to general functioning, operations, it would be useful that when, in the course of the trial, some realities change -- I'm trying to slow down because of the interpretation -- we should be informed in time, because there are some problems that arise which do not necessarily concern the Trial Chamber, but may concern the Trial Chamber later.  

We encounter some problems related to the country of residence of some witnesses who -- which insist on deadlines related to their own internal procedures.  I would like to insist on this fact because there are some witnesses on the list, at least two of them, which would have to testify through video conference.  If this were to be the case, we would be imploring the Trial Chamber to inform us in good time, particularly since at least one of these witnesses has serious difficulties travelling.  That is what I have to say at this point.  Thank you very much, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Officer.  Yes, thank you, Officer.  We -- we are sorry for having detained you for so long, but we also hope that you have benefited from the deliberations that have taken place here.  The parties and the Trial Chamber have taken note of what you have said, and we'll do everything possible to ease your work.  You may now leave us.  Thank you.

And before we forget to emphasise this point, we shall not have a break, as we had earlier envisaged.  We'll continue with this trial without a break.  Yes, we would only like to add that the break was tentative, and the evolution of time has proved that we don't need this break.  So, we will not take it, and the parties should take this matter seriously.  

We have a few more points to raise before we end this conference.  Any comments on exhibits, Prosecution? 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
None, My Lords.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Okay, then.  The Trial Chamber notes that disclosure with regard to exhibits is okay.  

The next issue we'd like to broach is pending motions.  The Trial Chamber is working around the clock to ensure that all decisions are issued in due course.  We have two questions for the Defence by way of winding up.  First of all, we would like to know from you -- we recall -- we seem to recall that you made an opening statement at the beginning of the trial.  Do you want to comment on this matter, Defence Counsel? 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Yes, Madam President, but if you would allow, I would like to do that when we resume, just before the witness, this afternoon, starts.  I would like to have a small opening statement before the Defence case begins.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Counsel, noted.  Yes, we also note that in the decision we made on the 8th of April, we scheduled the alibi witnesses to testify at -- during the last weeks of the Defence case.  We do notice that Counsel has given us a new list.  Does this list include alibi witnesses?  What is the position with regard to these witnesses? 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Madam President, your decision of last Friday, I believe, posed a problem as for the alibi witnesses that we have now.  Since we still have not been able to ask, we're still waiting for the execution of your decision, or order by France.  We have a few alibi witnesses, T5, T6, T9.  These are witnesses who are coming to testify on the presence of Nzabonimana in the French embassy.  

I would say that these witnesses were already on the plane when you rendered your ruling.  Two of them are coming from Europe.  Postponing them to the end of the Defence case would present a major difficulty for me, particularly since, as things stand now, I do not see the need.  These are witnesses who are coming to testify to that fact.  What is important to us is that we be able, because we've been looking for one year -- we had to wait for the Security Council decision on this issue.  We are waiting for witnesses from the French embassy, functionaries of the French government who are working at the French embassy.  

So the problem today causes us a prejudice.  If they don't have these people, this would cause us a problem.  A member of the Security Council contributed to the Tribunal.  They have refused to cooperate with us.  They are not really cooperating with us.  So, here, we can only come up with some incomplete defence of alibi.  But, however, we have some witnesses who would be coming to testify on the fact that Callixte Nzabonimana was at the French embassy and not in Nyabikenke. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.  Yes, thank you, Defence Counsel.  

These are the observations of the Trial Chamber:  The Defence has presented an order of appearance of witnesses, which includes alibi witnesses.  The Prosecution has already accepted these and, since this is the case, these witnesses will be presented in accordance with this order of appearance.  

Any other issue that the parties want to raise before we close this conference?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Your Honours, I'm doing this with a view to maybe save a further motion to be presented to the Trial Chamber.  You ruled earlier that we had to move by way of a formal motion to reinstate Mr. Fernand Batard and Madam Suzanne Thomson, which are now the two witnesses that were excluded by your order of the decision that you rendered in March.  The only two remaining witnesses are Fernand Batard and Suzanne Thomson.  

We have -- when we included them in the list of 30 witnesses, or 44 as you wish to call it, we provided the Chamber and the Prosecutor with all the personal identification sheets that was included -- that was required by the Trial Chamber.  We did not hear any objection from the Prosecutor that they were prejudiced in their investigations, or that they did not have enough time to prepare.  

The reason I'm trying to vent that issue now before you is that Madam Thomson's contract, by the Registry, has been approved, and this is a long process that needs some time to do, and because, of course, a report needs to be filed three weeks before she testifies, as per Rule 94 bis.  She works -- well, you are working on our motions day and night, I could say, with a view to finalise that report.  

So the submission I would kindly request is to confirm that we can, indeed, have these two witnesses included in our list of 30 witnesses.  And why I would kindly and respectfully request you to reconsider your decision is the way I am reading the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, and particularly Rule 73 bis and Rule 73 ter (E), which clearly states that it is only once the party's evidence has started that the concerned party needs to move by way of a motion and show good cause to change the list of witnesses.  

And this interpretation was confirmed by you, Madam President, and, yourself, Judge Rajohnson, in two decisions that were rendered in the Ngirabatware case where a similar situation, but with regards to the Prosecutor, arose.  And the Prosecutor simply added a witness to its list before the beginning of the presentation of its case, and the Defence objected to that.  And Your Honours, in that decision, reminded the Defence that the Prosecutor was at liberty to change its list of witnesses before its case has started, at will.  And I will read that passage from that decision.  It's paragraph 55 in the decision of 12th June.  And it reads as follows: 

"Lastly, with respect to the Defence allegation that the Prosecution added a witness to its proposed witness list without seeking leave --"  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Could counsel please slow down, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
"Lastly, with respect to the Defence allegation that the Prosecution added a witness to its proposed witness list without seeking leave to vary its witness list, the Chamber reminds the Defence that Rule 73 bis (E) requires the Prosecutor to seek leave to amend its witness list from the Chamber after the start of trial."  

Not before.  And I would kindly ask you to apply a similar reasoning to the Defence.  I think there's a saying that goes as follows:  What's good for the goose is good for the gander.  And I would kindly ask Your Honours simply to avoid -- we have witnesses that are in town and we need to concentrate on preparing those witnesses.  And I'm sure Your Honours will agree that we should file less motions.  And I would kindly request you to reconsider your earlier decision and simply to accept that Mr. Batard and Madam Thomson figures on our list of 30 witnesses which has been repeatedly disclosed to both the Prosecutor and the Chamber without any sort of objection from the Prosecutor.  

And I would conclude by maybe apologising for not completely -- having completely well figured out the way the decision was rendered.  We honestly understood it as meaning that, provided we were submitting the personal identification sheets for those witnesses, it was okay to include them in our list of 30 witnesses.  And it is on the basis of that misunderstanding that we worked.  I thank you, Your Honours.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Madam President, we did not want to stand up and object because this is a status conference in the first place, but the Court has a ruling of 26th March 2010 which the Court has also confirmed today, that excludes those two persons for reasons very clearly stated in paragraph 21.  

Now, if my learned friend, during this status conference, is arguing a motion for review or reconsideration, I think he's out of order, and his submissions must be dismissed.

I think this is a matter that is completely decided, and the horse has bolted.  There were certain things that they were supposed to do, which they did not do even after reminder.  And, consequently, those witnesses were ordered to be removed from the list.  

Now, I think that is the position that we are in.  I don't think this is the right forum to argue a motion for reconsideration or review, particularly when the Court has, again, reminded them that the position of the ruling of 26th March 2010 holds.  So, I think if he needs to come to court, he knows the route and the method, and this is not the place to do it. 

My Lords, I therefore request that that submission be disregarded as out of order, and that it is -- in any event, involves a substantive motion in order to have a reconsideration of that matter.  As the Court pleases.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, any reply?  Very brief.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Thirty seconds.  

Your Honours have already ruled on that.  When I made an oral motion for reconsideration earlier on, you confirmed that it was possible to do it orally, in this Court, when the cross-examination of one of the witnesses was suspended.  But, in any case, I did not see the Prosecutor bring any prejudice if we include those two witnesses.  I am just trying to make the most efficient use of this courtroom.  We are still before -- and at the time when these witnesses were added, we were way before the commencement of the Defence case.  And, therefore, I would kindly request that the list of 30 witnesses, which has been repeatedly brought before this Court, be maintained as such.  

I thank you for your attention, Your Honours.  

MADAM PRESIDENT: 
This will be the ruling of the Trial Chamber on this issue:  The Trial Chamber does not want to reinterpret a clear order it made on the 26th of March 2010, and which it has reiterated today.  The Trial Chamber still considers that the Defence is following an inappropriate procedure.  The procedure to be followed was clearly pointed out:  The Defence has to file a motion to vary the witness list.  We were prepared to entertain that oral motion in these proceedings, but it's late now, so the Defence will have to file a written motion for the variation of the witness list, fully justifying the motion it has filed, and the Trial Chamber will act accordingly.  That is the ruling of the Trial Chamber.  The motion for reconsideration is accordingly dismissed.  

Do we have any other matter from any party? 

Yes, we regret that this status conference has taken this long, but it was necessary to enable us to proceed smoothly after this.  This is what the Trial Chamber proposes to do:  We will break for lunch shortly and resume this trial at 4 o'clock.  We believe that 4 o'clock will enable the Defence to prepare itself and also the Trial Chamber to render a pending decision bearing on the protection of a witness.  Accordingly, these proceedings are adjourned to 4 o'clock this afternoon.  
(Court adjourned at 1305H)
