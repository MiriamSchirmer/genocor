P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.  The Trial Chamber would like to welcome you back to these proceedings, which will be brief this time around.  

Could we have the appearances of the parties, for the record, please, beginning with the Prosecution. 
MR. MAWERE: 
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  

The Prosecution team is led by Mr. Paul Ng'arua, senior trial attorney; and also has as its members, Memory Maposa, Appeals counsel; Diana Karanja, associate legal officer; Éfrem Mutashya, 
language assistant; three interns, Jamet, Marion, Catherine Gibson and Godwin Manyiga, and myself, 
Simba Mawere, assistant trial attorney.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Learned Counsel.  If we may enquire, are all these interns old ones or do we have any new ones?  
MR. MAWERE: 
There is a new intern, Catherine Gibson.  She came when we were just about to close the last session.  And she is just behind me. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, we just wanted to remind you about the average position of the Trial Chamber, that we would like everybody who comes on any team, anyone, to be introduced, so that we get to know the people we are working with.   

We would like to welcome the new intern to the Prosecution team and to this Trial Chamber.  

Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  

The Defence team, this morning, is made up of Nathalie Leblanc, Callixte Nzabonimana, myself, Vincent Courcelle-Labrousse, and our interns are Ms. Anja Kortenaar, who was here in the last session, Ms. Judith Khelifa, whom I will ask to stand up to be recognised, who has just joined our team.  And, lastly, Mr. Charles Brozille, who was here last time and he will be joining us in court very soon, and an intern who was here last time.  He is called Erick Sullivan.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Learned Counsel.  We would also like to welcome the new interns to the Defence team and to the Trial Chamber.  

Learned Counsel, before we proceed with the witness on the stand, we would like to know whether the order of appearance that you filed is the current order that would be followed. 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Yes, Madam President, the order of appearance would be respected.  We have a problem with the 
last witness, T95.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, unfortunately, the witness is in Court, and we don't really want to have any elaborations made in his presence.  Maybe at an appropriate time, you will let the Chamber know what the problem is.  

So, Counsel, which witness is this one? 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
T64. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  We would now like to give a briefing to the witness before you begin your examination-in-chief.  

Witness, D. 64, is that correct?  T64?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
That is correct, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness T64, we welcome you to the Trial Chamber. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is my pseudonym. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, we would like to welcome you to the Trial Chamber and to give you a briefing in order to make your testimony smooth.  

The first thing we would like you to learn is to switch on and off your microphone.  Switch on when you are speaking and switch it off when you are done.  Thank you.  If you leave it on and there is another microphone open, the proceedings are interrupted because the interpreters and recorders and the 
Trial Chamber cannot clearly hear your testimony.  And it is important that we hear and understand it and that the interpreters and court recorders do their work accurately.   So, please remember that point as it is important.  

We would like also to give you an appraisal of the procedures which obtained here.  
Registry, could you pull the curtains a bit, the curtain in the left side.  Pull it a bit forward.  
Yes, thank you.  

So, Witness, now that you have learned to switch on and off your microphone, these other procedures which will -- will follow.  

You will be led in your evidence in-chief by the Defence team, which is seated on your left.  When they have done with asking you questions, the Prosecution side, which is on your right, will also ask you questions.  The Prosecution is seated below the translation booth on your right.  

The Judges are entitled to ask you questions at any time during the proceedings, should they consider that any matter requires clarification.  We require you to answer all questions put to you, and if a question is not clear to you, you may seek clarification from the counsel who has put the question to you or the Trial Chamber, if it is one which has put the question to you.  

We also require you to be brief and direct in your narration.  We don't want you to undertake long narrations because they are difficult.  They make the work of the interpreting and recording your evidence very difficult.  

So, answer briefly and directly, the question.  Evasive answers are not going to assist the 
Trial Chamber to quickly conclude your testimony.  So keep this in mind as we go along.   We also require you to be courteous to all the counsel and the parties and anybody else present in this courtroom.  Likewise, we require everybody present here to be courteous to you. 

If a question that has been put to you is improper, the Trial Chamber will say so.  You should not refuse to answer a question because you consider it improper.  You are a protected witness and, therefore, these proceedings will be conducted in both the open and closed sessions.  It is the Trial Chamber to decide whether you will give your testimony in open session or in closed session.  

In an open session like the one we are in at the moment, the public will be entitled to attend and to obtain a record of such a session.  Therefore, when we are in open session, be careful not to mention any names or places which may identify you.  Should counsel consider that the information that you are about to give will disclose your identity, we'll ask the public to leave and conduct the proceedings in a closed session.  And when we are in closed session, feel free to give any information even if it may identify you, as the public would be excluded from such a session and the record made at that level will not be made public.  These are the simple procedures.  

Yes, Witness, will you be testifying in Kinyarwanda?  Is that the case? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I will be using Kinyarwanda. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, in that case, we require you count -- to observe a brief pause before you begin answering the question, after you have switched on your microphone, make a brief pause, count up -- from one to three, and this is to enable you -- to enable the Accused to follow your testimony in Kinyarwanda.  If you do not observe that pause, the answers to him and to the interpreters will not be clear.  And so, before you begin to answer, count one, two, three, and then begin speaking after you have switched on your microphone. 

We believe that if you follow these simple procedures and listen carefully to the questions put to you, we will quickly come to the end of your testimony.  And we would now like to hand you over to the Defence team, which will lead your evidence in-chief.  

Defence Counsel.  

Thank you, Registry.  

Witness, can you stand up to take the solemn declaration, first. 
(Declaration made by Witness T64 in Kinyarwanda) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel. 
WITNESS T64, 
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	Now, Witness, I would like you to remember what the President told you.  When you are answering my question, try to count one, two, three, internally before you start answering, because there is the issue of overlapping of microphones, and so the Kinyarwanda interpretation comes late in our microphone.  So if you don't pause, we will not be able to hear you.  
A.	I've properly understood you, Counsel. 
Q.	You have before you a personal identification sheet, and I may ask one of the interpreters to help you read that sheet because I understand that you can't read French? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could we have one of the Kinyarwanda interpreters come down to assist the witness, please.  

And, Witness, we are in open session, so do not mention any information that may identify you.  If you have a question relating to this information, ask the Trial Chamber first before you can speak about it.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, for now, there is just one interpreter in the Kinyarwanda booth.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We don't appear to have a choice.  We'll just wait for him to go back before we begin again.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the text has been read to the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel. 
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Now, then, Witness, the interpreter has read out your identification sheet to you.  Do you have any corrections to make on the points that have been read out to you? 
A.	The information contained on this sheet is correct. 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
I would, therefore, request that this personal information sheet be admitted in evidence.  This is a protected witness.  I'm sorry. 
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Witness, do you have a pen on you?  If you do have one, please sign the personal identification sheet and including the date of today, the 5th of July 2010.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution, do you have any objection to the tendering of this personal identification sheet as an exhibit?  
MR. MAWERE: 
We have no objection, Madam President, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, perhaps, Registry, show the Prosecution also the signed copy. 
MR. MAWERE: 
We've actually been shown the signed copy, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay, then, so which exhibit would this be, Registry?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 40. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
The personal identification of this witness is entered as Defence Exhibit 40. 
(Exhibit No. D. 40 admitted) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Very well.  Madam President, Your Honours, I am very sorry, once again, for the public, since we are going to discuss a very specific area, and since the evidence will dwell exclusively on that area, I am obliged to seek a closed session at this time.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, could you arrange for a closed session.

Members of the public, we regret that you have to leave at this moment because the matters that are going to be discussed may identify the witness who is a protected witness.  We, therefore, request you to leave now. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 7 to 60] was extracted and filed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
