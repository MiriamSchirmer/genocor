Cross-examination by Mr. Roach (continued)	5






P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The session is called to order.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  I believe, now that we have finished viewing the six CDs, we are going to be able to continue with the proceedings. 

Mr. Roach, are you able to continue with the cross-examination of this witness?  You have the floor. 
MR. ROACH:
I believe my friend has something to say before I do. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.  I hadn't seen you on your feet.  Please go ahead. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.  I just have two matters that are very brief. 

First, I just wish to inform you that I still do not have the statements of GFA.  You were advised yesterday afternoon in Court that they would be available, by the Prosecution.  I went to Mr. Webster's office yesterday.  They were being processed.  At the end of the day yesterday, they had still not been processed and I still have not received them, although I understand they are in the process of being distributed by the registry.  I just want you to be aware of that so that when it comes my turn to 
	cross-examine, you will understand when I ask for an adjournment. 

Secondly, I would like to present an oral motion pursuant to Article 28 of the Statute for a request to be issued by the Trial Chamber for cooperation to the government of France, and specifically I'm asking that the Trial Chamber request the government of France to provide to the Defence copies -- a full and complete copy of the report of the investigation into the assassination of 
	President Juvénal Habyarimana and others, conducted by Judge Jean-Louis Bruguière.  

	I had made, on the 8th of December, a request to the government of France in writing requesting this material, and I asked the registry to transmit that to the French authorities, which they have done, and I have a series of written annexes which I would ask the registry to accept and to file, that show the transmission of my request to the registry and my request to the government of France, and there is a letter from the registry that was on the 30th of December.  The embassy of France acknowledged receipt of the letter and requested the -- a copy of my request, which had not been attached to the letter by the registry, by mistake, and the registry has now since informed me they promptly sent my request to the government of France as of January of 2004.  And we have not received any response to our informal efforts to obtain this document, and so I'm asking that, pursuant to Article 28, the Trial Chamber request the government of France to cooperate by providing this material. 

I would not want to make a detailed argument on this motion but simply to say that, pursuant to Article 28, there are three criteria:  one, that efforts be made informally to obtain the documents, which I have done; second, that the request be specific and not too broad, and it's limited to one report so I believe it meets that criteria; and, third, that it be relevant to an issue in the case, and this is an issue which I believe is something that is very strongly contested between the Prosecution and the Defence and we've expressed this position in previous pleadings, that we believe that it's highly relevant who was responsible for the assassination of President Habyarimana, and it's relevant to whether there was a plan, as alleged by the Prosecutor, or not.  And we would seek the assistance of the Trial Chamber in obtaining this evidence so that we could use it during our case, when it's our turn to present evidence. 

I also note that today is the 10th anniversary of that event, in which President Habyarimana and the other head of state, as well as those who accompanied them, were killed, and I'd ask the Trial Chamber to observe a moment of silence in their memory because of that tragic event. 

Thank you very much. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson. 

Counsel for the Prosecution, you have the floor.
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Your Honour.  First of all, I'd like to correct the record.  I believe, when we parted yesterday, I stated quite clearly that the statements that are in question, the eight statements in Kinyarwanda, would be available in my office.  I invited the Defence to come and pick them up informally, if they didn't want to wait for CMS.  Mr. Robinson came to my office directly after we recessed yesterday, when, of course, the statements were not ready at that time, but I did give him and his associate my mobile phone number and asked them to call me at the end of the day.  Neither of them did so.  The statements are ready. 

I'm completely shocked, really, to hear him allege that he hasn't received the statements.  I was in this courtroom when my assistant walked over to the Defence side of the room and gave him and Mr. Roach copies of the statements.  So it's ridiculous to suggest that he does not have a copy of it.  It's disingenuous and it's simply -- it's a deliberate falsehood.  The statements had been filed with CMS, or will be filed with CMS.  They will make their way to the rest of the Defence in due course, but he is actually in possession of those statements as we speak now. 

As for his application to request cooperation from the government of France, this is a motion that was made at least once or twice before.  There was a motion to -- for cooperation to the United States, to Germany, to Belgium, and I believe France was among the countries for which this request was made.  The Court has already ruled on that motion.  My recollection is that the Court has ruled on this issue at least three times before.  This Court has already found that the circumstances of the crash of the airplane are not relevant to the determination of issues in this trial.  And on that basis, I would urge this Court to deny the Defence application and to reprimand the Defence.  This is the -- must be at least the fourth or fifth time that the same motion is coming before this Court.  This issue has been decided -- not once, but at least two or three times in this case.  And it's really a waste of our time to go into issues that are redundant. 

The issue of the Kinyarwanda statements did not need to be raised.  The issue of the request for cooperation did not need to be raised.  And maybe this Court needs to put aside a day for all of Mr. Robinson's oral motions so that we can go directly into the witness testimony.  If -- it may be appropriate to sit on Fridays and just take Fridays to hear all of these motions that cause us so much disruption during the course of the witness's testimony. 

I could be more expansive in my responses, but I really would urge the Court to proceed with the continued cross-examination by Mr. Roach, and on that basis I will conclude my remarks at this point. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, if I could just ask Mr. Webster to confer with --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	Please, wait for us to give you the floor.  We still have not done so. 

Yes, Mr. Roach? 
MR. ROACH:
Yes, Madam President, I should like to join in the request of Mr. Robinson with respect to the Judge -- the obtaining of Judge Bruguière's report.  But the reason I rise is my friend, the Prosecutor, has said that you've already ruled, if I understand what he's saying correctly, that this matter of the president's death is not relevant in this case.  He used the word it's not a matter that should be imported into this case.  It seems that, to me, that this is quite important from our perspective, and if your decision is going to involve the relevancy of the incident on the 6th of April, ten years ago today, if that is going to be one of the decisions you are going to make now, I think you ought to give us full opportunity to express why we believe that that is important in this case and why it should be admitted into evidence.  

What I'm referring to specifically would be the circumstances of the assassination of President Habyarimana.  It has been described as an incident that triggered what followed on the ensuing days.  And I do not want to take any more time than to say that if you are going to make any such ruling with respect to the admissibility of that evidence, we should like an opportunity to fully address it.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
In order to avoid lengthening the debates, the discussions, we are requesting you to kindly file your grounds for your motives -- for your motions in writing and then we shall render a ruling at the appropriate moment. 

Mr. Roach, you have the floor for continuation of cross-examination of the witness. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President, may I just be heard for one moment? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we have allowed you to put anything you want to say to us in writing, because we want at least to conclude the cross-examination of this witness.  Please send us anything you have to say in writing. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Roach, you have the floor. 
MR. ROACH:
Yes, Madam President.  I'm seeking some direction here because I have some difficulty in completing my cross-examination.  The difficulty I have is that certain statements made by this witness were presented to us just at about 10 minutes past twelve today, and these statements are in Kinyarwanda, and I should like to have an opportunity to peruse these statements with my client before I complete my cross-examination.  I am advised that the statements are quite at variance with the testimony that is given in Court by this witness. 

The other difficulty I have, Madam President, is that I have had an opportunity not just to hear this witness but also to read and review his testimony with respect to the meeting at Ruhengeri.  In particular, his testimony with respect to the speeches of my client and three other major speakers appear to be quite different to what the witness says.  The witness has attributed certain utterances to President Habyarimana, to my client and to others, which appear to me to be quite at variance with what we have seen and what we've heard in the translations as we viewed the video -- or the CDs.  But I do not have a transcript or I do not have the text before us so that I can confront the witness with those areas where his recollection and his relation of what was said is quite different to what's on the tapes themselves. 

Now, it is important for me, from my perspective, that the words and the context of the words said by at least two of those on the tapes, the president, President Habyarimana, and also my client, it's important for me to go over those words very carefully because it appears that those words are going to be -- or are potentially the words that are going to be used by the Prosecution as part of its case to show that there was some intention to plan or to incite a genocide. 

I want to have those before I complete my cross-examination of this witness.  So those are two aspects of what we need. 

Now, I want to say that it appears that the exercise that was gone through in listening to these CDs is going to at least take a lot of burden off of you because we are able to distil certain areas to complement my friend's areas, and my colleague, Mr. Weyl, has compiled about ten or 12 minutes of footage that we should like to emphasise or we should like the Court to view, if you will permit that.  And this would be to avoid getting into a lot of time examining the videos. 

So those are my submissions and the difficulty I have in completing my cross-examination.  I just summarise by saying I need to have the text of the speeches, and I need to have some assistance, and my client can give me this assistance -- just one moment, please -- in translating the Kinyarwandan statements that I have received only a few moments ago. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Roach, we have taken due note of the difficulties that you are encountering arising from the information you provided; namely, that you have just received statements in Kinyarwanda and also from what Mr. Weyl has taken from the viewing of the videos.  We believe that the transcripts will be available shortly, so you'll be able to examine them, and we ourselves will also be able to do the same, to see whether the Chamber needs to see some of the CDs in question. 

Yesterday when we adjourned, you were saying that you needed at least another two hours for two points on which you wanted to question this witness.  So we are requesting you now to continue with your cross-examination on matters which do not touch on these matters you brought up just now.  We can deal with the rest when we come to them. 
MR. ROACH:
Thank you, Madam President.  In that event, I will just reserve with respect to the Ruhengeri meeting, and I will continue some points that I have.
WITNESS GFA,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROACH: 
Q.	Now, good morning, Witness. 
A.	Good afternoon.
Q.	Yes.  You told us -- yes.  Time flies, Witness.  I was still in the morning, but maybe I should say "bonjour" and that covers morning and afternoon. 

Now, you told us that you and others fled Ruhengeri and you went to the Congo; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Yes.  And when -- did your family leave with you? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Yes.  And did your mother and father go with you? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	And do you have siblings?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And did they go with you as well? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, you told us that while in --
A.	Except one, except one of my brothers.  Only one of my brothers.
Q.	One of your brothers stayed behind? 
A.	Yes.  He fled to another area.  He fled towards Byumba because he had been previously in Kigali.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, could you kindly wait for a pause between the question and the answer?  
THE WITNESS:
He fled into the zone which was occupied by the Inkotanyi.
BY MR. ROACH: 
Q.	I see.  And he was a supporter of the Inkotanyi?
A.	No.  He was a small child.  He was living in Remera, and when the Inkotanyi came to evacuate people, it was my sister, she was still quite young, so she therefore left with my mother towards the area occupied by the Inkotanyi.
Q.	I see.  Now, you told us that you arrived in Goma; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	And you told us that you saw Mr. Nzirorera in the Congo; is that correct?
A.	Yes, quite so.
Q.	And you fled with military personnel, correct?
A.	Everyone fled, be they soldiers or civilians.  We were all on the way to exile.
Q.	Now, you went to a particular camp, and in that camp you told us that you saw Mr. Nzirorera with military uniform on, and with soldiers; is that correct? 
A.	No.  I didn't say that he was in a camp.  I said that I saw him in Goma, where I was living, and where he, Nzirorera himself, was living.
Q.	I see.  So were you in a camp after you left and arrived in the Congo? 
A.	No.  I never went to live in a camp.
Q.	So you lived in the city; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  I was living in the town of Goma, together with my relatives and other members of my family.
Q.	And how long was it that -- before you returned to Rwanda? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can Counsel Roach repeat that question, please? 
BY MR. ROACH: 
Q.	How long was it before you returned to Rwanda? 
A.	My parents spent two weeks in exile, whereas I spent one month in exile.
Q.	So you returned in August of 1994? 
A.	Yes.  It was towards the end of August 1994.
Q.	Yes.  Now, the place that you stayed when you were in the Congo, was that a place for refugees? 
A.	I stated that I was living with relatives.  We had relatives in Goma, in the Congo, and we were sheltered by them.
Q.	Oh, yes.  Very well.  And when you came back to the Congo, it was on your own -- from the Congo, I should say, was that on your own volition or were you forced to leave? 
A.	I went back home of my own volition.
Q.	And in your view, was it safe then to go back?  The circumstances that caused you to leave no longer existed? 
A.	I went back to Rwanda because my parents had gone back to Rwanda and had done so for two weeks already.  So I wanted to join my parents.  And furthermore, I wasn't in my country.  I felt like going back home.
Q.	So did you go back to your house? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	And sometime later, you were arrested.  When were you arrested? 
A.	I was arrested on the 1st of April 1995.
Q.	So between August of 1994 and April of 1995, did you go about your regular life?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	I see. 
A.	Just like any other inhabitant.
Q.	Were you in hiding at any time after you returned to Rwanda? 
A.	No.  I never went into hiding.
Q.	Why were you arrested? 
A.	I was arrested because of the genocide.  I was accused of having participated in the genocide.
Q.	And when you were arrested, where were you taken? 
A.	To the gendarmerie camp or -- in Ruhengeri.
Q.	And between 1995 and the present time, could you tell us what prisons you were in? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecutor? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm simply concerned about disclosing the witness's identity, Your Honour.  If we are going to go close to the circumstances of his arrest, where he was detained and those types of details, maybe we should do it in closed session. 
MR. ROACH:
May I ask the witness a question? 
BY MR. ROACH: 
Q.	Witness, before you answer my question that I put to you, may I ask you -- you told us that you were 
	-- where you were taken.  Now, was it known by the neighbourhood where you come from that you were arrested? 
A.	I was not outside the country for me to be able to know that.
Q.	Can you -- can you say -- or you don't know -- if your neighbours knew that you were arrested? 
A.	It's impossible to know.  At the time of arrest, it's not possible to know if people outside the country are aware.
Q.	I am not talking about people outside the country.  I'm talking about your neighbours, the people who lived in your cellule, the people who were next-door neighbours to you.  Did they know of your arrest? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, please.  How can the witness know if all of his neighbours were aware?  Isn't that speculation? 
MR. ROACH:
No, it's not speculation.  He may know.  He may have been arrested in the marketplace.  He may have been arrested in broad daylight with people observing.  I wanted to know if it was a -- if he knows.  He can either say yes, he knows, or no, he doesn't know if his neighbours knew that he was arrested.  So I ask that I be allowed to put the question to him as to whether his neighbours knew that he was arrested. 
THE WITNESS:
It is for that reason that I responded to you that I don't know.
BY MR. ROACH: 
Q.	Yes. 
A.	Because I was inside, in prison.  I have nothing to add, Counsel.
Q.	Yes.  You can tell us you don't know right away, if you don't know.  I'll be satisfied with that answer. 

Now, did any other members of your family get arrested, as far as you know? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecutor? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm concerned with this line of questioning, Your Honour.  So I'm objecting on that basis. 
MR. ROACH:
May I respond? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may respond to the objection, Mr. Roach, yes, of course. 
MR. ROACH:
Yes.  This line of questioning that I have now, this question, the ensuing several questions, all have to do with credibility and motivation of the witness insofar as his testimony that he's giving, which we will be challenging.  I could be more explicit, if my friend wants to, but they have to do with credibility. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I hesitate to object because I don't want to interrupt your cross-examination, but the types of questions you're asking are going to come closer and closer to the personal circumstances of this witness, and the witness has already expressed concerns about revealing his identity.  I mean, we went -- we've gone into a number of areas already which really should have been inquired into in closed session.  So I mean, if this line of questioning is so important on issues of credibility, let's go into closed session and you can ask the questions that you need to ask directly.  My only concern is about disclosing the witness's identity and doing this as quickly as possible. 
MR. ROACH:
I pray that the Court allow me to ask my question as to whether his -- I'm asking the question of whether his family knew that he was arrested, and also whether other members of his family were arrested. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, we've asked about who his mother is, who his father is, where he was living in Goma, how many brothers and sisters he had, was his family together, were they apart, where they came from, when they fled.  These are all questions that point to the identify of the witness.  That's the concern.  He's coming from a small community.  That should be obvious to us all. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Roach, the Chamber is of the opinion that some of these questions may reveal the witness's identity.  If the witness answers your question, for example, regarding whether or not his parents were aware of his arrest, that is fine, but asking which members of the family were arrested, for example, may reveal his identity.  So we are asking you to be cautious, if we rest in open session, in not asking questions that may reveal the identity of this witness, who is a protected witness. 
MR. ROACH:
Thank you for directions, Madam Chairman. 
BY MR. ROACH: 
Q.	Now, I'd like to ask you, Witness, about some of your colleagues, whose names you mentioned.  Do you recall you said you went out with a number of members of the Interahamwe on certain missions?  And I want to ask you if those persons or any of those persons were arrested.  Do you know? 
A.	Yes.  Some were arrested. 
Q.	And were these persons arrested at the same time as you were, or around the same time? 
A.	No.  Each was arrested individually.  It was not at the same time.
Q.	Yes.  And at any time, were you in detention together with any of these persons who you had done acts of murder and other violence with? 
A.	Yes.  There are some.
Q.	I see.  Is there anyone in Rwanda that you are afraid of? 
A.	Yes.  I can mention the names, if you so wish.
Q.	Are these persons persons who might harm you? 
A.	In Kinyarwanda, it is said that man is the worst of animals.  Nzirorera has relatives in our home and elsewhere -- in my home area and elsewhere.  You are the one who is contributing to the fact that we are placed in danger when you ask these kinds of questions.  I'm sure that Nzirorera's relatives in Belgium have been looking for members of my family.  Anything can happen to me.  I can even be poisoned.  He has relatives everywhere.  And this is why I'm telling you this.
Q.	But Mr. Nzirorera would know your identity, wouldn't he?  Does he know you, in other words? 
A.	He knows me far too well, too well.  Here we are in this courtroom, we are discussing, and what is surprising me is that the information is filtering to the outside and this kind of information is obtained, and I don't know how it is happening, and I think you are the one who is contributing to this, with these kinds of questions that you are asking.  It would -- I think -- I came here to testify about Nzirorera and not on myself. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I believe that this exchange does indeed prove that we are moving away from the essence of the matter at hand.  Maybe you need to review the questions that you are putting to the witness in order to avoid this kind of spillover.
BY MR. ROACH: 
Q.	Witness, isn't it correct that, in Rwanda, you appeared before various justice personnel or court personnel? 
A.	I was arrested by an institution, but I don't see where you're going with that.  I would beg you not to ask me questions concerning myself, my life and my trial.  Rather, ask me questions pertaining to this ongoing trial.  All I can say to you is that I did not appear before various courts. 
Q.	But you did make statements to various prosecutors; isn't that correct? 
A.	I know that I gave testimony, that I was questioned about the charges against me.  I don't know who at this time has those documents, but I do acknowledge that I did make testimony, that I did give testimony.
Q.	And did you give any testimony under declaration or oath? 
A.	Yes, the deposition I'm making here and now.  The procedure in place in Rwanda is known.  You can find out about that.  When you are being questioned, there is no solemn declaration to be made.  You only make such an oath when you're in trial.
Q.	Have you been able to review any of the statements that are attributed to you? 
A.	Yes.  I re-read some of my statements; not all of them, however.
Q.	And in particular, there were some statements in Kinyarwanda that were sent, we understand, from Rwanda, which purport to be witness statements of yours.  Did you see those statements?  
A.	I saw some statements.  There is others that I have not seen.  If you don't show them to me, I don't know which ones you have.
Q.	Yes.  But of those statements that you did see, were they authentic?  Were they your statements? 
A.	Yes.  I was able to verify the authenticity of some of those.
Q.	Were there some statements that you could not verify the authenticity of? 
A.	All of those that I did see are my own.
Q.	Now, you can verify these statements as being authentic, but can you also vouch that the contents of the statements are true? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting to the form, Your Honour.  We are talking about multiple statements.  I would request Counsel to break it down and talk about the statements he made to the ICTR, the statements that he made in Rwanda.  We are all aware that there are at least ten, 12 statements that this witness made.  The question is too broad.  So if he could particularise that, I would request that.  
MR. ROACH:
I could do that, Madam President, but I do not want to do that because --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  If you could be more precise, if you want to do that, that's very well.  So you want to move on to another question? 
MR. ROACH:
No.  I want to ask him generally, because I do not want to take the time at this point to go into individual statements, but I just want to know if the witness has any difficulty with any statements, and then, if he does have difficulty with any statements, then we can move to more particulars. 

So I request that I be allowed to ask the witness, who said that all the statements he saw were authentic, but I'm now asking him with respect to the contents of the statements he saw, is he satisfied that all the statements are correctly -- or the statements of fact in them are true and correct.  If he has a problem, then I would go through the tendentious business of going through statement by statement, but I don't want to do that because that eats into the amount of time that I have.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I think -- I'm gratified to hear that Mr. Roach is concerned about the time, but for the accuracy of the record, I think it would be more appropriate to go statement by statement.  First of all, we don't even know how many statements we are talking about.  The witness was asked a blanket question about statements.  We don't know how many are from the ICTR, how many were in Rwanda, how many are confessions, how many are in other cases.  We haven't even put to this witness what statements he's making, in what context, on what subject, and so on and so forth.  So on this point, I think it's a reasonable expenditure of time to go statement by statement and identify it to the witness and show it to the witness, if need be. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Roach, the Chamber prefers the other solution, even if it takes time, going statement by statement. 
MR. ROACH:
Yes, one moment. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very briefly, Mr. Robinson.  It's Mr. Roach who is cross-examining this witness. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I would like to repeat that I don't have the statements.  

Mr. Webster, I think, owes me an apology for saying that I had them.  So I don't have these statements.  If we are going to deal with these statements, I would like to be provided with a copy of them so I could follow along.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I thought Mr. Roach said that those statements came to him today at noon.  Did you not receive them at the same time as Mr. Roach? 
MR. ROBINSON:
I did not receive them at the same time.  Only -- apparently, the case manager only brought two copies of the statements, and when I asked her for one, she said it was necessary for her to give one to Mr. Roach and one to Mr. Hooper.  So I wish Mr. Webster would clarify that as well because he's making me look like I'm a liar, and in fact I'm telling you exactly what the situation is.
MR. WEBSTER:
Just a point of clarification.  I had requested that the statements be distributed directly to Mr. Robinson and to Mr. Roach since they were the two attorneys concerned with cross-examining this witness, but there may have been a mix-up in communication.  So I do have two additional sets which would I like to hand over to the registry and have them deliver directly to those two counsel who have not received them.  So perhaps I did mistake -- misspeak but it was not -- it was with good intention.  My directions were for the statements to be delivered to you.  I saw the case manager go across the courtroom, and I assumed that you had received the statements. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  I think that the statements are being handed out to other counsel.  They have the documents now and we may proceed.  If some have not yet received the documents, please address the registry, who will hand those documents over to you. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you have another problem, Counsel?
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Madam President, I don't have another problem.  It's the same problem.  I want to protest.  The Prosecutor cannot choose amongst the Defence teams, only giving two of the statements to two amongst all of them.  These documents must be communicated disclosed to all of us.  This must be denounced, and denounced before you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Counsel.  You have denounced that, and we are in the process of giving documents to each of the Defence teams.  As such, we may proceed now. 

Counsel Roach, you have the floor. 
MR. ROACH:
Thank you.  I want to advise the Court that I might have to make a revision of the time that I estimated, because these statements that have been just delivered to us -- is it okay?  May I proceed? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Counsel. 
MR. ROACH:
Yes.  These statements that have just been proceeded -- produced to us have not been as yet digested by myself, and, as I said before, and to go through the statements in detail, I will have to defer that until I can consult with someone who speaks Kinyarwanda and who can help me with them. 

But I have a few other questions that I can deal with and come back to those statements later. 
BY MR. ROACH: 
Q.	So, Witness, you told us that you were arrested in April 1995 and you were in custody until when?  When were you released? 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm assuming that there is some grounds of relevance.  I mean, Mr. Robinson had expressed a concern about going into the credibility of the witness.  I have no objection to exploring the credibility of the witness, but if we are going to go into the circumstances of his detention, when he was released, and those types of details, those are things that will reveal his identity.  So I request that we take those questions in closed session. 
MR. ROACH:
I could ask that question a different way, if you would allow me to proceed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you cannot ask that question.  There is a problem with it regarding the witness's identity, but if you can put a question to the witness that will not reveal his identity, you may proceed with that. 
BY MR. ROACH: 
Q.	Witness, isn't it true that, in Rwanda, there is no witness protection, and all the statements that you made and so on, you had no identity protection?  Isn't that correct, when you were in Rwanda? 
A.	If you're saying that I gave my testimony officially, I wouldn't be given the pseudonym I was given.  If, in Rwanda, I gave my statement in public, you're saying that even now I should do the same in public. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Roach, at this stage, we are going to stop the proceedings.  We are going to stop because we -- another trial will be taking place in the same courtroom.  We will start tomorrow at nine o'clock. 

Very well.  We do have a decision to render and also a correction to make, this after the witness is escorted out of the courtroom. 
	(Witness stood down)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We want to make a correction regarding the problem of the report of Judge Bruguière.  We have a decision.  It was Mr. Robinson that filed the motion.  He was asking the -- for the report of Judge Bruguière and all of the annexes and supporting materials regarding the motion -- or, rather, the investigation into Habyarimana's assassination.  The decisions made by the Chamber was that the Defence did not demonstrate the relevance of the assassination of Habyarimana on 6 April 1994 and the persons with him.  Consequently, as we said earlier, Counsel Robinson, if he maintains his motion, must show us a -- file a written document explaining the grounds of his motion, must file that with the Chamber. 

As regards a motion, an oral motion, filed by Counsel Robinson, the Chamber would like to render its decision.  As regards the motion for certification of appeal of 1st April, 2004, against the decision authorising part of Witness GFA's testimony to be held in camera, the Chamber points out that it has the discretionary power to decide if it shall sit in camera or in open session.  The Chamber is only obligated to make public the reasons of its decision to sit in camera.  The Chamber repeated in open session what it had said in closed session, that that decision was rendered in order to ensure the protection and security of the witness and was made in the interests of justice, under 
	Rule 79(A)(ii) and (iii) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 

Consequently the Chamber is of the opinion that a decision based on such grounds does not involve an issue that would significantly affect the fair and expeditious conduct of the proceedings  or the outcome of the trial, and the resolution of that issue will not materially advance the proceedings.  Consequently the Chamber denies the motion for certification of appeal. 

We thank you all.  We wish you a good afternoon, and these proceedings are adjourned until tomorrow morning at nine o'clock. 
	(Court adjourned at 1325H)
