P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Short, and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Wednesday, the 19th of October, 2005, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera, et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  

Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Registrar.  We can note the appearances are the same.  
MS. TALON:
Good morning, Mr. President.  This is The Hague.  We have no sound in French.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
There's a problem with the French translation which is being tested now.  
MR. FRY:
Excuse me, The Hague, this is Arusha.  I've just been informed that we can hear, in Arusha in the courtroom, French on channel 3, and I'd like to now -- I can see that the French booth is talking.  Can you hear the French booth properly?  
MR. LOMBARDI:
No.  
MR. FRY:
Can you see if by checking another channel, for example, your channel 3, if you can hear the French booth properly?  
MR. LOMBARDI:
We have only two channels, and on both on them we cannot hear French.  

Oh, wait now.  
MR. FRY:
So you're still not hearing anything that's said from the French booth; is that correct?  
MS. TALON:
That's fine now.  We can hear you now.  Okay.  That's very good.  Thank you very much.  It's fine now.  It's fine now.  We can hear you now very well.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you.  

We seem now ready, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, before beginning with Witness G, I just want to note that we received this morning the disclosure of the memorandum from the president to yourself with respect to the witness Mbonyunkiza, as well as the response from the victim witness section to the letter of Mr. Mbonyunkiza, but we haven't received the letter of Mr. Mbonyunkiza, which actually was what I had requested be disclosed to us.  So I don't know if that was intentional on the Trial Chamber's part or if there was -- but in any event, I would renew my request for disclosure of the letter of the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, as you noticed, my order was implemented as I had made it, but we'll reconsider the issue.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you very much, Mr. President.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If I could just comment briefly, Your Honour.  I recall making a similar comment when Mr. Robinson first raised this issue, and I'd simply like to restate for the record that our position is that disclosure of the letter is entirely discretionary of the Court.  If the Court makes a determination that it's not relevant to these proceedings, my request would be that it not be disclosed to any of the parties.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
WITNESS G, 
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, good morning.  Can you hear me?  
MS. TALON:
Witness G is putting on his headphones now.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Good morning, Witness G.  
A.	Good morning.  
Q.	You look very chic today.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I'll ask The Hague if they have received this morning a fax of two documents from Arusha to be used with this witness.  

MS. TALON:
No.  We have not received anything.  Which fax number did you use, Counsel?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  I'm going to ask Mr. Fry to respond to that.  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  The registry received a telephone number from Mr. Koffi Afande in The Hague yesterday, and this morning about 9:00 we sent the faxes to that number.  But it's possible that they're still in the process of being transmitted, but I know we've already sent them, so thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Mr. President, if you could direct the registry in The Hague to make some enquiries and to try to locate those documents, I can move on to other topics in the meantime.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sure that will be done as a matter of a routine.  But in the event it is necessary, I request that every effort is made to obtain access to the documents as quickly as possible.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I would like the contents of tab 164 to be placed in front of the witness.  

Mr. President, yesterday we began offering -- I believe it was admitted -- D. NZ23A, B, and C from tab 164, and these contain speeches of President Théodore Sindikubwabo and Prime Minister Jean Kambanda on the 11th of April.  

And for the witness's benefit, if he could be directed to look at page K0260674, which is the French translation of those speeches, and it begins on page 12 of the French transcript.  And for those following in English, it would be page K033133 (sic), and in Kinyarwanda, it would begin on page K0144211.  And these three documents are, again, excerpts from tab 164.  And if Mr. Fry can confirm that those -- that Exhibit 23A through C has already been admitted; is that correct?  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, I admitted the Gikongoro speech on that number, and I'm not sure if he'd like to replace the Gikongoro speech with this one.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Actually, I think you admitted the Gikongoro speech as D. NZ20, and the replacement of the Gikongoro speech will come later once they receive the fax.  But has D. NZ23 been admitted?  
MR. FRY:
Just a moment.  Let me check.  

Yes, Your Honour, I have it as admitted, A, B and C. 

MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Thank you very much.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness G, do you have in front of you the French version beginning with the speech of President Sindikubwabo?  

Witness G, looking at the page that has the K-number K0260674 on the bottom -- it's page 12, and on the bottom of that page there starts a speech of President Sindikubwabo.  Do you have that?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  Now, it's not a long speech, so I'm just going to read it, and then I'll ask you some questions about it.  So, "Fellow Rwandans, your government was put in place only two days ago, and it has started functioning" --  
MR. ROBINSON:
Judge Short, you look -- are you confused?  Am I in the wrong place?  This is on the English K0330133.  It starts at the very top, "Speaker Théodore Sindikubwabo, president of the republic."  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So "Fellow Rwandans, your government was put in place only two days ago, and it has started functioning.  You listened to the message that the speaker of the Conseil national pour développpement national assembly addressed to Rwandans on 8 April when he informed them of the decision taken by the leaders of the parties in the transitional government after the death of the head of state and by the prime minister, for the formulation of another government so that our country will not remain at an impasse.  

"You were told that for this to be possible, especially as the broad-based transitional institutions had not yet been put in place, you were told that for the formation of the government, it was necessary to abide by the provisions of Article 42 of the constitution of 10 June 1991.  We have abided by the law.  The speaker of the national assembly provisionally replaces the late president of the republic, his excellency, Major-General Juvénal Habyarimana.  You have been told the rest of the story.  

"What we would like to underscore in this message is to inform, once again, all Rwandans and the international community, especially the countries with which we have friendly relations, that the main reason why we put in place this government with well-defined objectives is to restore and maintain peace and security throughout the country.  This peace and security began to be trampled underfoot, especially in Kigali town as a result of the pain and anger felt by Rwandans when their enemy rendered them orphans.  

"Rwandans, inhabitants of Rwanda, we, ourselves, value this primordial objective.  That is why in the government council's meeting that we led today and in the council of ministers meeting led by the prime minister yesterday, 9 April, this objective of restoring and maintaining the security of the people and their property was our priority.  All directives have been given on this issue.  All ways and means of achieving this objective are being sought, and we are resolutely determined to achieve this objective without delay, so that government's other objectives can also be achieved subsequently, particularly with regard to negotiations with RPF and the thorny issue of hunger decimating the population in several regions of the country.  

"All inhabitants of Rwanda, what is your contribution?  What do we want from you?  Your contribution is to know that none whatsoever has the right to tamper with the life of his or her neighbour or appropriate his or her possessions or damage them.  That is why orders and directives have been given to security officers, at all levels, to be more vigilant so that anyone caught in the commission of such criminal acts will be punished exemplary.  Therefore -- everyone is, therefore, urged to keep the peace.  Unauthorised roadblocks should be dismantled forthwith.  Small groups of bandits and other criminals, whose only aim is to fish in troubled water, should be dismantled.  Everyone should show the law enforcement officer where they think the criminals could be hiding.  Thus, if we stand together in unity, peace and order, then unity, peace and order will be restored shortly, so that we could go about other business that has been abandoned for some time now.  

"Rwandans, inhabitants of Rwanda, we thank, once again, those whose conduct has been irreproachable in these difficult times and ask them to continue along that line.  We disapprove of and publicly condemn those who have encroached the rights of others or still harbour such criminal plans.  We publicly thank, once again, our armed forces.  To all of you who have a grateful heart and are peace-loving, we ask you to help us thank them, for as we told you on 9 April, after the investiture of the government, if the armed forces officers had not met to take the necessary decisions in order to protect their country and the people, unrest would have taken a different turn, and stopping it would have been problematic.  

"Fellow Rwandans, inhabitants of Rwanda, we always support the very laudable objectives that the government aims to achieve in the shortest possible time.  That is why we are asking you again for your support, which we hope to obtain from most of you.  That is why we are asking you, once again, to support your government by abiding by the rules and directives you have received from the various administrative bodies.  Thus, the peace and benefits that go with it, which we wish for you, will come from you.  Long live."  

Now, Witness G, could the president of Rwanda have been any more clear in his instructions to the population to stop the killing?  
A.	Counsel, I do not know whether you have the audio cassettes of RTLM from the 7th to late April 1994.  At the time the president was delivering that speech, he was asking the population to ensure security and peace.  The RTLM was inciting the population to kill.  And I wonder why -- because they were in a position -- they had the power to shut down that radio station -- why didn't they do so?  Now, what was said was the contrary of what was being broadcast on the RTLM.  So the population was there, and everybody had their radiosets, and they would listen to the radio.  So what I can say is that the Radio des Mille Collines was like a Bible.  Everybody listened to the radio and followed and obeyed what the RTLM was broadcasting to the population.  I, therefore, do not understand why they allowed the radio station to continue to have influence on the population and to incite the population to kill.  That is what I can say.  Well, all is fair and good.  The speeches are very good, but the reality was also there.  Thank you.  
Q.	So, Witness G, in answer to my question, would you agree that the president, in his message at least, could not have been more clear as to his instructions to the population to stop the killing?  
A.	I told you that the speech was a good one.  It was very clear.  
Q.	And it was broadcast on RTLM, was it not?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And I know you keep coming back to RTLM, but the people who were in charge, or allegedly in charge of RTLM, they've been tried and found guilty -- and you testified at their trial -- but now we're trying to determine the individual responsibility of other people.  So it's not so useful to keep coming back to RTLM.  But in any event, I would like you to now look in the same tab to the address of President (sic) Kambanda which follows on page K0260677.  That's the French.  And for the Kinyarwandan, it starts on page K0144215; and for the English, it starts on K033134.  This is a long speech.  So it's going to be not productive for me to read it in its entirety.  Instead I'm going to ask you some questions about it.  So it may be necessary for you to have a look at the transcript as we're going through this.  

First of all, does it appear to you that this was a speech that was made after the meeting that President (sic) Kambanda had convened with the prefects from all over Rwanda?  
A.	I can see Prime Minister Jean Kambanda's speech, but I am not aware of the circumstances under which he made the speech.  If what you're saying is true, we can move on. 
Q.	Well, I would just like you to be able to look through the speech a little bit more, and perhaps you could see that he is reporting about what is going on in the different préfectures later on in the speech.  Maybe you could just look ahead in the speech and see if it appears that he is speaking of the different préfectures and makes reference even to -- he doesn't know what prevented the préfet of Butare from coming to the meeting.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, if I might comment briefly, excuse me for interrupting, but yesterday evening, I had a conversation with Mr. Robinson and we raised the issue of going through exhibits and how we could expedite matters and smooth the administration of the admission of exhibits.  And that discussion was not very fruitful, but one of the points that I made to Mr. Robinson yesterday was that I would appreciate if some foundation was led from the witness before we move to an exhibit and putting an exhibit in evidence and reading directly from the exhibit.  

So this line of questioning, for example, I think it would be preferable for Mr. Robinson to ask the witness, does he have any independent recollection of speeches by Jean Kambanda, and if the witness does not, then he can direct him to the transcript.  But if we continue in this fashion, it's going to lengthen the period of re-examination because we're going to go over the issue of foundation for these various exhibits.  And as a matter of form, I'm asking the Court to instruct the Defence counsel to lay the proper foundation before we actually move to the exhibit.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, we did have the discussion that Mr. Webster alluded to, and I was going to work towards that with other documents, but since this document has already been admitted, I felt that I was free to refer to its text without going back and laying any foundation, but if you feel it's useful, I can do that.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I wasn't sure about this document being admitted because yesterday I understood that only one segment of the speech -- of the entire transcript was admitted.  I don't believe that was the segment where Jean Kambanda was speaking, but I -- Mr. Robinson can correct me on that point.  But we did not put the entire transcript in evidence.  It was -- what I remember is the excerpt from Ngirumpatse going into evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Fry?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if I could clarify that, the excerpt from Ngirumpatse came in as Exhibit D. NZ22, and then D. NZ23 is this -- these pages -- groups of pages of K-numbers which included the speeches of Sindikubwabo and Kambanda.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Fry, could you comment on that?  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, I believe that's correct.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  If the document's admitted, you don't need to lay foundation again.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness G, I'm going to ask you to direct your attention to the bottom of page 18 of this, the French version of this transcript.  Do you see the reference there to Butare?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And does it appear to you that -- or does that refresh your memory that this may -- this speech by President (sic) Kambanda followed a meeting of the préfets in Kigali?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And in this speech, does Prime Minister Kambanda say that the minister of justice was requested to have the prosecutors resume their work -- resume their work and punish those who were responsible for making troubles and disorders?  And I'm referring now to the bottom of page 18; and for the English, I was looking at page 11 -- page 11, the third paragraph from the bottom.  
A.	I don't see any reference to the minister of justice on page 18.  
Q.	Could you look on page 16, at the bottom, the second paragraph from the bottom.  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And then does he also later on in the document ask the préfets to call security meetings to calm the minds of the population; and to request that the bourgmestres organise meetings in their communes; and that heads of departments should also organise meetings to calm the population?  For the English, that would be at the bottom of page 12, and for the French -- the French, it should be somewhere on page 19, I believe.  

And, Witness G, if you look down to the third paragraph on page 19 in the French, I think that's what I'm referring to.  
A.	Yes, I've located it.  
Q.	Okay.  And then also does President (sic) Kambanda -- Prime Minister Kambanda, excuse me, go on a few paragraphs later that -- to say that -- actually, I'm going to read now from two paragraphs after where we've just been -- that -- or the next paragraph, he said, "They should explain what happened" -- this is at the top of page 13 of the English.  

"They should explain what happened, that the death of the head of state, the unrest that took place in Kigali town, and the resumption of hostilities by the Inkotanyi should not incite the Rwandans to attack one another.  They should make them understand that there are three ethnic groups in the country, namely, the Hutus, the Tutsis, and the Twas, and several regions; and that these ethnic groups and regions are components of the nation; and that no one should exclude the other from the country; and that they should tell them to avoid anything that can divide them, behaviour based on jealousy that has been observed during the attacks and lootings.  In reality, one cannot say that it was only the properties of such and such ethnic groups that were looted.  For anyone who had property, be they Hutus, Tutsis, or Twas, could be victims regardless of their ethnic group, but because he or she had something more than the others.  

"So I can, therefore, conclude that jealousy can divide the people.  They should avoid whatever divides people like jealousy, regional segregation, but especially ethnic segregation because that is what seems to have prevailed for some time now.  And people should avoid taking the law in their hands and know that the armed forces are there, that the law and the authorities are in place."  

So was that the message from President (sic) Kambanda on the 11th of April broadcast to the public?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And was that message consistent with the message you were trying to deliver to the secteurs when you made your tour on the 10th?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness G.  And now I'm going to ask that you be shown document number 24 from the bundle that was faxed to The Hague which is a speech of President Sindikubwabo on the 13th of April 1994.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, we have the speech only in French.  We do not have it in English.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, first of all, if I could ask you if you recall having heard this speech before.  
A.	I'm not sure which speech.  I would have to glance over the speech to be able to tell you whether or not I heard it or not.  
Q.	Okay.  Well, I'm going to ask that the French interpreter booth read this speech out.  It's not very long.  And then I'll ask you some questions about it.  
MR. ROBINSON:
So may that be done, Mr. President?  I'm not capable of reading this.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Could you hold on a second?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, what is concerning us, as just a general proposition, we think that -- but this is something which is likely to happen from time to time, and it will save a lot of time if the witness had an opportunity to get these documents the day before coming into court at least.  So that we don't take up this time in the courtroom for him to review and refresh his memory.  And we hope that -- we anticipate that this is going to happen over and over during this trial with several witnesses, and we're wasting a lot of time.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I agree, Mr. President.  I don't have any problem with that, and, in fact, when I tried to ask the witness to look at these during a break, he didn't seem to want to do that, but if you order that the witness be given access to the documents that I've faxed to The Hague and order him to review those during either breaks or overnight, I have no problem with that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Well -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, if I may, I have additional concerns, however.  The Court has referred to the document as refreshing the witness's recollection, and the witness has never stated that he heard the speech in the first place, to have his recollection refreshed.  And my concern is a lot of these documents and these speeches are going in wholesale -- whole scale, and there's no foundation for it.  The proper foundation for it has not been laid.  I'm not suggesting that this should never come into evidence.  We've included it in our exhibit bundles, but I think it would be a fairer procedure if it came into evidence in what I hesitate to say is a more correct way.  If Mr. Robinson asks the witness, "Do you recall President Sindikubwabo making speeches during the course of the events?  How many times did he make speeches?  Which ones do you remember?  Do you remember a speech he made on the 13th of April" for example, and so on and so forth.  And then we'd all have some sense of what the witness remembers and can inform this Court of his own recollection and what we're feeding to him by giving him these transcripts and having him read them into the record.  

So, I mean, it's a procedural point, and I think I'm objecting to the form that this cross-examination has taken.  All of these doc- -- all of these speeches are coming in when Mr. Robinson can read the speeches and answer his own questions, because that's essentially what he's doing.  He's having the witness re-read something that he's giving him, and we don't know what the witness heard and how the witness positions, evaluates this speech in the context of all of the speeches that he heard on the radio.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson -- Mr. Webster, what we were addressing was allowing the witness to see documents which are going to be used in cross-examination before the cross-examination takes place, because we have been having to waste a lot of time while the witness looks at these documents in court.  And we think it would save time if he had a chance to see the documents before he came into court, and that is really what we were addressing, not necessarily something to happen right now, but as a process to save time.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I understand that, Your Honour, and I -- I -- I -- I understand the reasoning behind the Court's suggestion, but my concern is still that we have no way of knowing if the witness remembers these speeches at all.  We don't know what the witness heard.  Now, these speeches exist.  We have transcripts of them, but this is not the way that this information should be placed before the Court.  We don't know -- the witness has never testified that he heard anything over the radio other than calls to incite the population to violence.  When has this witness ever said that he heard Sindikubwabo make any speech on the radio?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, the proposition that you have put forward is consistent with what our view of the situation was.  During the examination-in-chief of this witness, however, Mr. Rapp put forward a proposition which seems consistent with what Mr. Robinson is doing now, and because at that time Mr. Robinson had supported him, we accepted that that was the provisional -- the position at these Tribunals.  Now the matter has been raised again.  What we propose is to allow Mr. Robinson to proceed in this way, but we will review the situation ourselves and come up with our own idea as to what the law requires and let you know in due course.  

Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  Thank you, Mr. President.  And, Mr. President, if I could just indicate that I think one thing that would be very helpful, one thing that I'm not able to do -- I try -- I make every effort to meet with these witnesses before they give their testimony, and if I had been able to, this could have gone a lot smoother.  And the Prosecution is able to meet with these very same witnesses, and Mr. Rapp did a wonderful job of moving through his direct examination.  So I think that that has to be taken into consideration in deciding how the Defence can proceed with a witness that he hasn't met.  But in any event I'm going to ask Witness G to put his headphones back on now.  Let us know when he's ready.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Witness G, I see you're already in place.  So let me ask you, have you had a chance, while we've been on break, to take a look at the speech of the 13th of April 1994, from President Sindikubwabo?  
A.	Yes, I have.  
Q.	And are you able to recall whether or not you heard this speech broadcast before?  
A.	You know, I've heard many speeches by Dr. Sindikubwabo, but all the speeches seem similar, so that now I have also learned things from other speeches you've shown me.  So I don't know what you want to ask me of this particular speech.  It's up to you to decide what you want from me.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you, Witness G.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I'm not quite sure whether to offer this as an exhibit for admission or identification.  Normally, in the past we've been proceeding where these documents can be admitted, but there seems to be some inconsistency in the Prosecution's position on that.  So I guess what I would like to do is first try and offer this as D. NZ25 for admission, and then if not, I'll offer it for identification.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
 (Exhibit No. D.NZ25 admitted) 

MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G -- 
A.	Counsel?  Counsel, all these speeches that you have shown me are beautiful speeches that were made.  I do hope that you will have the opportunity to show me other speeches which they made during other opportunities which were speeches inciting the inhabitants, and they do exist, speeches by the prime minister and by the president of the republic.  I thank you.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you, Witness G.  And just to assure you that we are going to come to some other speeches, and also as part of this process, the Prosecution will have the chance to question you when I'm finished, and anything that they feel will assist them, they can ask you as well.  So be assured that it's not necessary for you to advocate on that point and that the Prosecutor is capable of doing that.  

But if we could turn to the speech of the 13th of April, can you tell me that -- does President Sindikubwabo indicate that they would do everything possible so that murders and theft end definitely in all of Rwanda; and does he call for the international humanitarian organisations to come to Rwanda to assist those in need; and call for a spirit of tolerance between Rwandans and to end feelings of suspicion?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Now, I'm going to ask you if you could look at Exhibit D -- well, at the next document number 25 in my packet that was faxed to The Hague, which is a speech of the next day, the 14th.  
A.	One moment, please.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, while that document is being retrieved in The Hague, I would offer this as Exhibit D. NZ26, that being the speech of President Sindikubwabo on the 14th of April.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
 (Exhibit No. D. NZ26 admitted) 
MR. WEBSTER:
On this issue, Your Honour, I'm simply relying on the guidance from the Court from five or ten minutes ago, but note for the record my continuing objection to this manner of proceeding, but we'll wait for the Court to revisit this issue, and we can address it globally for how we proceed in the future.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, Mr. Webster, if you have a serious objection, other than a procedural objection, it can be admitted for identification.  We thought that the issue was really procedural rather than (unintelligible).  So that's how I see it at the moment.  That's why I proposed to proceed in this manner until we re-visit it more fully.  
MR. WEBSTER:
It's procedural to the extent that having these documents come into evidence at some point is not a problem.  We've -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I understand you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Right. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we will be looking at it, and we will -- we will have a definitive position very shortly.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  Just to clarify, my objection or my concern is the way the questioning is structured, and I would prefer that there be some foundation, that we put this in context, that the witness be asked how many speeches he heard, and so on and so forth, the proper foundation be laid before we admit it into evidence.  But the fact of it coming into evidence is not a problem.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We understand that.  So we will address that shortly.  

You may proceed, Mr. Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President:
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Witness G, do you have in front of you now the speech of President Sindikubwabo on the 14th of April 1994?  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	And can you just take a minute to review it?  It's not a very long speech.  It's one page and one quarter.  And then let me know when you're finished.  

Witness G, have you had an opportunity to read the speech of the 14th?  
A.	Yes.  And I am saying that I believe I heard this being said in the speeches made by President Sindikubwabo.  
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness G.  And in this speech, does he ask people to forget about any hatred, anger, or revenge; and say that if you attack when you're being attacked, you are attacking yourself; and asking the people to stay vigilant so that no one is unjustly treated; and to denounce to the army or to any authorised people in charge of security those who try to take advantage of the troubles?  
A.	Yes, he does say that.  
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness G.  And now I would ask that you be shown the next document in our packet that was faxed to the Hague, which is number 26, a speech on the 17th of April by President Sindikubwabo.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And, Mr. President, at this time, I would ask that this document be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ27.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
 (Exhibit No. D. NZ27 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Witness G, when this document is in front of you -- again, it's only a page and a quarter, so I would like you to read it to yourself and then let us know when you're ready.  
A.	Yes, I have read the text.  
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness G.  And is it true that on the 17th of April 1994, President Sindikubwabo condemned some group of criminals who do not abide by their instructions; and asked that they be punished exemplary; and said that the government cannot tolerate people who kill and steal while they are working for peace; and those who are tarnishing the image of the country before the international community; and did he ask all administrative organs, including the prosecution and the courts, to stand as one and stop this behaviour; and did he warn any civil servants who might be taking part in these scandalous acts that they would never be pardoned in any way; and that they would be punished as a lesson to anyone who thinks of killing or stealing; and did he warn people that while they are distracted killing each other, the enemy will be accomplishing his programme; and that crime must be uprooted from the population?  Was that part of President Sindikubwabo's speech on the 17th of April?  
A.	What I'd like to say is that I cannot confirm that I heard this speech, but hearing what you have just read, I can confirm that this is what is, indeed, on this paper, but I cannot confirm that I heard this particular speech, because I heard many speeches, and I wouldn't be able to specify on what day I heard which speech and what was the content thereof.  And that's what I can say for the time being.  
Q.	Okay.  Fair enough.  Thank you very much.  Now, I'd like to move to the next day, 18th of April, and I'm going to ask that you be shown number 27 in the package that was faxed to The Hague, and this has two versions of the speech.  One is in Kinyarwandan, and one is in French.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And, Mr. President, I would offer as D. NZ28A, the Kinyarwandan version, and 28B, the French version.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
 (Exhibit No. D. NZ28A and D. NZ28B admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Witness, whatever you're more comfortable working with, either the French or the Kinyarwandan, feel free to review that text.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Before we move on, could I make an enquiry of where the -- the translation and the transcription of this particular speech came from?  Because this is -- if we're talking about the same speech, this is something that we have an official translation and transcription from our language section, and we have the original audio tape.  Maybe Mr. Robinson can begin -- if the witness can take his headphones off, Mr. Robinson can clarify that for us before we continue.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I believe these are also translations that came from the language section, but what we could do, on exhibit 20 that was admitted yesterday, was -- also was the language-section transcript of this -- this speech in Gikongoro on the 18th of April.  And they're basically the same, but if Mr. Webster feels more comfortable, we could go back to Exhibit 20, show it to the witness, and we could work from that.
MR. WEBSTER:
My preference --
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, Mr. Robinson, it's not only preference.  We need -- if we're going to admit a translation, it still has to be authenticated.  So are you acting on the basis that the translations you're tendering came from the language unit?  
MR. ROBINSON:
That's correct.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So if the language-unit translation is Exhibit 20, there's no need to put another exhibit with the same information.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  That's -- that's fine.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And just for purposes of clarification, I don't mean to dispute Mr. Robinson's directly, but what I have in front of me as his document 27 has no K-number on it, which to me is an indication that it's not coming from the language section, because any language-section translation goes into the evidence unit, it gets a K-number -- gets a K- -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, Mr. Robinson has withdrawn that. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And he's relying on Exhibit D. NZ20. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that correct, Mr. Robinson?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, that's fine.  

And now I'm going to ask the people in The Hague to take item 16 from the package of information that was faxed to The Hague and put that before the witness in place of what has just been placed in front of the witness.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I believe The Hague is saying "One minute, please." 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, while they're getting that document, I just think to double-check, so I think we should all make sure that the record reflects that -- 
MS. TALON:
We have found the document.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you very much.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Witness, if you could please read the -- to yourself, the speech of President Sindikubwabo, beginning on the bottom of the first page, continuing on the second page, and then also it continues on the third and fourth pages.
MR. ROBINSON:  
And Mr. President, while he's doing that, I just want to confirm now, so that our records are correct, that D. NZ20 is the speech of the 18th of April, not the 8th of April, which originally it had been admitted as by mistake.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, the speech of the 8th of April, which exhibit number is that?  
MR. ROBINSON:
The speech of the 8th of April has been faxed to The Hague, and once it's received, it will be given a new number.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that's the -- the language -- the official translation?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  
MS. TALON:
The Hague has received the document number 18, which we didn't have yesterday.  We received it today.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Thank you very much.  And there should have been one other speech that came with document 18 to be used later today.  

Could the witness be given his headphones, please?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I've just read it.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness G.  And does this appear to be remarks made by President Sindikubwabo at a security meeting in Gikongoro préfecture?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And during this speech, did he say that each person should be the gendarme of his neighbour; and that gendarmes are for maintaining order and peace; and that the population must assist them in this task; that nobody should believe it is not his business; that everybody should be merciful towards his neighbour and resist anger in favour of national interests; and that everybody should master his temper and chase out the spirit of revenge?  Did he say those things in Gikongoro?  
A.	Yes, he said those things in Gikongoro. 
(Pages 1 to 17 by Wendy Molnar)




















     1130H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Thank you.  Now, perhaps you could be given document number 18, which has just been faxed to The Hague.
MR. ROBINSON:
	And for the benefit of the Trial Chamber, we are going backwards to some extent because this is a document that did not come through clearly on the fax yesterday, and this is a speech of 10 April by President Sindikubwabo.  And I would ask at this time that this speech be admitted as D. NZ28.  It is found at tab 161 of the Prosecutor's exhibits, at page K0337683.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
 (Exhibit No. D. NZ28 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Again, this is a relatively short speech, Witness G, so when you have document 18 in front of you, if you could read the portion beginning on page 7 and continuing on page 8 where President Sindikubwabo made a speech? 
A.	It is very difficult for me to read the document.  It is not legible. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you, Witness G.  
MR. ROBINSON:
In that instance then, I am going to ask, since the speech is not very long, is if the French booth can read the speech, and then it can be translated into English.
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible)
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, I was asking -- the witness had said that the copy is not legible. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Again?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  And so I'm asking that the French -- it's not a long speech, so I'm asking the French booth to read the speech, and then we -- I'll also hear it again in English. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honours, it would be appropriate for us to have some time to prepare ourselves for this exercise and also to have a repeat by Mr. Robinson of the K-numbers so that we can locate the document.  Thank you. 

MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, let me repeat the K-numbers.  It's K0337683 and K0337684.  It's contained in my number 18 in the documents faxed to The Hague.  It's also in tab 161 at page 7. 
MS. TALON:  
Mr. President, would you like us to take a break now while we try to sort out these documents, the numbers?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It may be practical to take a short break now. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if I could ask in The Hague that the other document is received, which is the speech of the 8th of April, that it can be shown to the witness, so that when we come back, he could have read that document, as well as if they have a legible copy of document 18, he could be looking at that as well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can do that, and if there's any special assistance that you are going to need from the language booth. 
MS. TALON:  
Mr. President, sir, from The Hague.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we're hearing you.  
MS. TALON:
Mr. President, document 18, which we received this morning, is as illegible as the one of yesterday.  But the document of the 8th of April, we have that speech of the 8th of April, that speech we can read and we can show it to the witness.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would ask the witness to read that document during the break and ask that the document with number 18, we can have the language -- the French booth read it out after the break, and I will see that they have a copy of it right away, if they don't already have it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you very much.  In those circumstances we think it makes sense to take the break now.  So we will rise for a short recess.  
(Court recessed from 1140H to 1208H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I think -- is everything -- all systems are ready to go now?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, they are. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. ROBINSON:
If we could begin by having the -- first of all, Witness G, are you having your headphones on?  Yes, I can see you, okay.  Thank you.  

Now, we are going to start by having the interpreters here in Arusha read the text of Exhibit D. NZ28, which is the speech of President Sindikubwabo on 10 April.  So can we commence with that, please?  Thank you.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"The president of the republic, Théodore Sindikubwabo, message of the president of the republic to all Rwandans.  Rwandans, inhabitants of Rwanda.  Your government was set up just about two days ago, but it has already begun its activities.  You have listened to the message from the president of the national council for development to Rwandans, relating to the decision setting up a new government, taken by leaders of political parties participating in the transition government after the death of the head of state and the prime minister.  We, ourselves, support this government.  That is why the council of ministers meeting, which we chaired today, and the cabinet meeting chaired by the prime minister yesterday, the 9th of April, focused on the objective of restoring peace and ensuring the security of persons and their property.  

All directives have been issued, and, always, a means of achieving these objectives are being sought.  We are determined to quickly achieve these objectives, so that the other objectives of government may also be reached, particularly negotiations with the RPF, as well as settling the serious problem of hunger that the various regions of the country are facing.  

What do we expect as your contribution?  Your contribution is to understand that no one whosoever has the right to tamper with the life of his neighbour, to appropriate his possessions or to damage them.  That is why directives were given to security officers at all levels to be more vigilant and to mete out exemplary punishment to anybody involved in such criminal acts.  We -- everyone must be a peacekeeper.  Unauthorised roadblocks must be disbanded.  Unauthorised roadblocks should be dismantled, and small groups of bandits and other criminals, whose aim is to fish in troubled waters, should be disbanded.  Everyone should identify to law enforcement officers any areas where criminals may be hiding.  In so doing, if we all stand together, peace and tranquility will be restored promptly and we will be able to focus on other businesses that seem to be abandoned for now.  

Rwandans, inhabitants of Rwanda, once again, we thank all those who behaved properly in these difficult times and we urge them to continue along the same lines.  We condemn, and once again disapprove, of those who attacked their neighbours and who still harbour such ill feelings.  

Once again, we want to publicly thank our armed forces, and to all those who are grateful and peace-loving, we call on you to join us in thanking them.  As we told you on the 9th of April, after the setting up of the government, had the officials of the armed forces not met to take all measures to defend the country and its people, the disturbances would have taken another turn and would have been difficult to bring to check. 

Rwandans and inhabitants of Rwanda, once again, we welcome the noble objectives and urgent objectives that the government is determined to achieve.  That is why, once again, we seek your support and hope that most of you will support us.  We urge you to support your government by respecting the laws and directives issued by all levels of the administration.  In so doing, you will be peace-builders and would also participate in the proceeds of such a process.  That is why we wish you long life." 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you very much for the interpreters for that.  That was excellent.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, during that speech President Sindikubwabo, on the 10th of April, asked that unauthorised roadblocks be disbanded.  Were, in fact, those roadblocks disbanded? 
A.	No, they were not dismantled. 
Q.	And he asked that people not harm their neighbour or their property on the 10th of April, but, in fact, people continued to kill and to loot after the 10th of April, correct? 
A.	Yes.  I do confirm that. 
Q.	And that included members of the population, as well as members of the youth wings of all the political parties, correct? 
A.	And soldiers as well. 
Q.	Yes, that's correct.  Now, have you had a chance to look at President Sindikubwabo's speech from the 8th of April as well, which is a document that was faxed this morning to The Hague? 
A.	Yes, I've read that speech. 
Q.	Mr. President, at this time I would offer this document, which is Exhibit D. NZ29, and I have copies that -- this has not been distributed previously, so I would ask that copies be distributed to -- I have given it to the Prosecutor, but I don't believe the Chambers have this as yet.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
 (Exhibit No. D. NZ29 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  Again, Mr. President, we have this only in French.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And I'll ask you, Witness G, in the speech of the 8th of April 1994, did President Sindikubwabo announce that the new government had been given three tasks? 
A.	Indeed. 
Q.	And the first task had been to quickly restore security to Rwandans and their properties; the second task to continue negotiation with the RPF; to install broad-based transitional government institutions in less than three -- than six weeks; and number three, to find a solution to the problem of hunger for those displaced by the war, is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And did he also call upon the Rwandan people to stay calm and to refrain from attempting to kill others, and to respect their properties? 
A.	Yes, that's correct. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you, Witness G, and we can put that document aside.  Now, I want to -- we've covered speeches going up to the 18th of April, and I now want to go back and talk about your activities in the period from the 12th of April up to the 18th.  So can you tell us, first of all, on the 12th of April, did you leave Kigali? 
A.	Yes, on the 12th of April I left Kigali. 
Q.	And you went to Butare, correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And on your way out of Kigali, or on your way from the place you were leaving to go to Butare, did you have to pass many roadblocks? 
A.	Only within Kigali.  Once outside of Kigali, I didn't have to go through any roadblock all the way up to Butare. 
Q.	And in those roadblocks in Kigali, were you able to pass through them because you had a military escort? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, was there a roadblock in an area as you were leaving Kigali, in the secteur that was -- well, was there a roadblock that was controlled by a person named Joseph Setiba? 
A.	Yes, there was a roadblock at Gitikinyoni, yes. 
Q.	And was Joseph Setiba a leader of a secteur of -- a leader of the Interahamwe from a secteur in Kigali or an area of Kigali? 
A.	To be honest with you, I only knew Joseph Setiba during the war.  Prior to that I did not know him.  He was introduced to me as chief of the Interahamwe in the secteur, I believe, Gitikinyoni.
Q.	And it's true, is it not, that this Joseph Setiba was very powerful during the period after 6 April 1994? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And were you aware that even other members of the -- even members of the Interahamwe national committee, on some occasions, had to give him money in order to let people pass through the roadblock that he controlled? 
A.	I'm not aware of that.  What I do know about that roadblock is that, to get through it, to get on to the other side, it was very difficult.  I have friends who lost their lives at that roadblock. 
Q.	Did you ever hear that number 3, on the Exhibit P. 9, had to pay Mr. Setiba in order to get some people to be able to cross through that roadblock? 
A.	Frankly, I was not aware of that. 
Q.	Was it true after 6 April that some people who held lower positions of authority, or even no position of authority, before 6 April, became more powerful than even their superiors? 
A.	Did you say before or after the 6th of April?
Q.	After the 6th of April.
A.	After the 6th of April I could see that there was no rule of law.  There was no authority.  It was mayhem.  Those who wanted to kill would not be prosecuted or sought by the gendarmerie.  It was the rule of the jungle. 
Q.	And as a result, were people like Joseph Setiba more powerful than, let's say, people on the list of numbers 1 through 5 on P. 9? 
A.	I know that Setiba was very powerful at that time.  Some members of the committee could not give orders to people like that. 
Q.	And was that also true in the military, as far as you observed?  Were there soldiers who had lower rank but yet were more powerful than their superiors? 
A.	Yes.  I could see that, but it also depended on which region you were from.  A corporal couldn't give orders to a colonel, for example.  It depended on the region too. 
Q.	And was the same also true for civilian authorities; were there some people who were, let's say, at the level of conseiller that had more power than the bourgmestre in a particular commune? 
A.	Yes.  I told you it was the law of the jungle in Rwanda.  There was no authority.  Everyone considered themselves a chief.  You at times would risk your life for things like that. 
Q.	Now, after you arrived in Butare on the evening of the 12th of April, did there come a time when you traveled for the day to Gisenyi? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you remember approximately which day that was? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Was it before the speech of President Sindikubwabo in Butare on the 19th of April? 
A.	No, after. 
Q.	Were the telephones working between Butare and Gitarama or any of the other préfectures as of, let's say, the 16th of April? 
A.	No.
	(Pages 18 to 23 by Jennifer Spring)


1230H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	 And were there any mobile telephones in those days, I am speaking of cell phones? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now on the 19th of April, you told us that you attended the speech of President Sindikubwabo, and you could hear that speech from outside; do you recall that? 
A.	I do recall that. 
Q.	And you told us that you understood that, President Sindikubwabo was using the word "work" to mean that people should begin the killing in Butare, correct? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	Now, we have now seen all of the speeches of President Sindikubwabo from the 8th of April, all the way to the day before this meeting on the 18th of April in Gikongoro and it's true, isn't it that he consistently was asking people to stop killing? 
A.	I will answer it this way:  Counsel, President Sindikubwabo came to Butare to swear in Préfet Nsabimana on the 19th of April that was during the day.  On that same day, he made that speech to tell the people that they should not attack one another.  

But on that same night, the 19th of April, after he made that speech, he went to Gisagara - - home.  And in Gisagara, there were killings.  And then they started killings throughout the préfecture of Butare.  Before that speech, I was in Butare.  I didn't see any killings in Butare.  After he made his speech, there were killings in Butare.  
Q. 	So did he show up to incite or did he really come to tell the population not to carry out killings?  
A. 	It's up to you to make that judgment call. 
Q.	I want to ask you to look at Document Number 28 that was faxed to The Hague and I was hoping to play a video of an interview with President Sindikubwabo, the transcript of which is contained in Document No. 28 in French.  And I am informed by the Prosecution that the list as of the last of the break, they were unable play any videos because of a technical problem, and I wonder if somebody from the Prosecution can tell me if that is still the case. 
MR. MORLEY: 
I understand Mr. Sendze has made an effort to link his computer to the system and he still has technical problems, we apologise. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I am going to see if I can just work with transcripts and then move forward. 
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	So, Witness G, if you could look at the document that has been placed in front of you with Item No. 28, which is a transcript of an interview of President Sindikubwabo, conducted while he was in exile, but while he was still alive.   And I hope to show you the actual video of this interview, but I am not able to do that at this time.  So I will ask you accept just for the purposes of my question that this is in fact what President Sindikubwabo has said.  Could you read that to yourself first?
A.	There are some parts that are illegible, but I was able to read the first and last paragraph.  I should tell you that he gave this interview whilst in Bukavu. 
Q.	Yes, that's correct.  And I am going, I think I can just ask you about the last paragraph so perhaps the copy that you have could be sufficient for our purposes.  But first of all, I would ask that it be admitted as D. NZ30. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, I am relying on the Court's instructions from early this morning, but I would still like to know when and where this, if Mr. Robinson can tell us this, when this interview took place and under what circumstances before we actually admit it? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, thank you Mr. Webster. This is an interview that is captured on KV000252B video.    It's a video tape of a news agency that contains many interviews with people about the Rwandan events of 1994 and I am not exactly sure of the name of the news agency, there were four news agencies that interviewed various personalities and Mr. Sendze, and I watched this video and confirm that this transcript was in fact on the video.  So, that is the information I can give you, I hope that is sufficient.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Not quite because I did watch the video myself as well, and my curiosity is when the interviews took place.  If you were able to determine that, and I would note that the video actually, the portion that deals with Sindikubwabo goes on for at least another minute or so.  So, all we captured here is Sindikubwabo's speech not the commentary that follows it, and not the speech, not the excerpts of the speech from Butare on the 19th is also included in that same documentary.  But my curiosity really is when and we can have established a date and approximate time. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
	Mr. President, it's my understanding that this interview took place in late 1994, but I don't have any more information than that. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could you ask the witness? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
It's a good idea.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	Witness G, do you happen to know approximately when President Sindikubwabo was interviewed in Bukavu that's reflected in this transcript? 
A.	The interview was given in 1994 after we left Rwanda in July.  Some members of the government lived in Ngoma.  President Sindikubwabo lived in Bukavu.  I was in Bukavu when this interview took place.  I was there at that time. 
Q.	Would that have been some time in the calendar year of 1994 either from July through December? 
A.	Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON:
So, Mr.  President, thank you for that suggestion and I may now ask the D. NZ30 be admitted. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D.NZ30 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:  
Q.	And, Witness G, is it true that when he was asked what he meant by the word, "Gukora" or to "work" in his speech in  Butare on the 19th of April 1994,  President Sindikubwabo said that he did not mean that people should kill, but that they should go back to their habitual occupations and continue those occupations? 
A.	Let me tell you, during that time Gukora meant to attack the enemy.  During that time the enemy were Tutsis or members of the RPF. 
Q.	I understand that that is how you understood it, but I am asking now what President Sindikubwabo explained during this interview?  So, can you tell us what President Sindikubwabo said he meant when he used the word Gukora in April 19th of 1994 in Butare? 
A.	Counsel, we all have a copy of this.  He is explaining his meaning of Gukora.  "Do your work.  Tend to your usual business".  That's all. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness G.  Now, do you know what it was that changed between the 18th of April 1994 when President Sindikubwabo was telling the people of Gikongoro to maintain order and peace and the 19th of April 1994 when he was telling the people in Butare to work? 
A.	I told you that the killings began in Butare or the same evening of the 19th of April 1994. 
Q.	Do you know of any contact that any member of the MRND executive committee had with 
	President Sindikubwabo between the 18th of April 1994 and the 19th of April 1994? 
A.	18th and 19th, no. 
Q.	Now, I want to ask that the next document be placed in front of you which comes from tab 169 and this is the speech of Prime Minister Kambanda on the 19th of April 1994 in Butare.  So you can be given 
	Tab 169, and within tab 169, there are three languages for President Kambanda's speech.  The French is found at K0273561, and that is on page 8 of the transcript.  The English is found on page K0273598.  And that is on page 7 of the English transcript.  And the Kinyarwandan is found at pages K0168571, and that on page 7 of the Kinyarwanda transcript.  So perhaps, if the witness could have the French portion of tab 169 placed before him.  And at this time, Mr. President, I would ask that these documents be admitted, the Kinyarwanda as D. NZ31A, the French as D. NZ31B and the English as D. NZ31C.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted. 

MR. ROBINSON: 
	Thank you, Mr. President. 
(Exhibit Nos. D. NZ31A, D. NZ31B, and D. NZ31C admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, Witness G, it looks like you have the document in front of you and I am going to ask you to go through President Kambanda's speech with me.  So if you, could look at the second page of the French translation which is page 9, and I am going to ask you to look at - well, first of all, just looking at -- 
A.	Could you, please, Counsel, indicate the K number for the French document.
Q.	Yes, thank you, Witness G.  That is K0273561.  Witness TG, you have the speech because we are trying to go through it together? 
A.	Yes, I finally have it.  
Q.	Do you?
A.	Yes, I have it. 
Q.	Now, looking on the page number 9, does it seem that the president - - I see that the prime minister is reviewing the events that have occurred in Rwanda over the past two weeks beginning with the death of the president of the republic, and then the unrest which occurred afterwards in which among others; the Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana was killed? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Does he recount also that the Inkotanyi from the CND building left the building and attacked the Rwandans, presidential guard's camp in Kimihurura?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then does he go on to explain about how the armed forces set up a crisis committee and then on the following pages how the president of the republic was chosen by the leaders of the MRND party? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then does he recount and I am looking now on about page 12 of the French, and page 10 of the English that pursuant to the constitution, they asked the MRND to propose a candidate for the prime and that he was appointed? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then does he go on to say what the three tasks were to the new government -- given to the new government.  I am looking on page 13 of the French and 10 and 11 of the English and those three tasks being the same three that we heard earlier from the speech of President Sindikubwabo? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And does he also indicate it and this is now on page 13 of the last paragraph that after the government was set up on the on the 9th, the cabinet immediately met in order to take some urgent measures with a view to restoring  security? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And that one of those measures requested the armed forces to do their best to thwart acts of insecurity be they by undisciplined soldiers or by ordinary citizens? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then turning to page 14, does he also call, say that one of the objectives and this is at the bottom of page 11 of the English of the government is to make sure that negotiations are resumed that the war is stopped and broad-based transitional institutions that includes the RPF are set up? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And looking now on page 15, does he recount and this is on the first full second full page, does he recount that we send another message to political party leaders and this is at the bottom of page 12 of the English with the unrest and violence prevailing in Kigali town, we believe that they could play an important role in stopping the killings.  That is why we asked them to contribute our efforts in order to reduce the scale of the killings by asking the members of their parties to stop killing people, and looting in order to put an end to the violence.  And then he goes on to say, I am able to tell you that the political party leaders responded as soon as they were able to because they met, I think on the 11th and took some measures in order to restore security. They called on the members of the political parties to ensure their own security without bothering their neighbours and their brothers and to avoid anything that may divide Rwandans such as ethnicity regionalism, jealousy or any other cause.  Do you recall -- do you see where President Kambanda said those things? 
A.	Yes, I do follow you. 
Q.	And, did he also say, going on to page 16 that in the message, we also ask the population to avoid turning against one another.  This is page 14 of the English at the top and starting, "Violence on ethnic or regional grounds, as I said earlier or any factors that usually bring divisions among Rwandans and that we want the bourgmestres, the conseillers, and even the cellule leaders to be informed of the content of that message," and that is ending on the top of page 17 of the French.  Do you see that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then turning to the top of page 18, and this is page 15 of the English, did the Prime Minister Kambanda say that they would be asking the bourgmestres to do what hey could in order to first ensure the security of the population and second secondly to defend the country's sovereignty and then goes on to say that means that they have to protect - - excuse me - - that they have to prevent the members of the population from turning against one another bearing in mind that we are fighting against the RPF? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So, would it be fair to say that President Kambanda was not, encouraging, excuse me, Prime Minister Kambanda was not encouraging the population to go out and kill Tutsis when he spoke on the 19th of April in Butare? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, I would like to turn to another exhibit which is number 30 in the materials that were sent to the Hague -- 
A.	Please, Counsel, Counsel, this speech was delivered on the 19th of April and on the same day, there were killings in Butare.  The most important people of the country were natives of Butare.  So, I think this is only a smoke screen because killings followed.  Well, maybe we should leave it at that. 
Q.	Well, Witness G, this trial is to determine who was responsible for the killings and so that is why we are asking you who said what and what happened afterwards so that the Trial Chamber can make those determinations.  So we are hiding the fact that killings took place in Butare.  It's not being denied.  But we are trying to understand who is behind that.  But if you could now turn to Exhibit No. 30 -- 
A.	Okay. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
And, Mr. President Exhibit No. 30 from my list of documents sent to The Hague is a speech of President Kambanda given on the 22nd of April, from Prime Minister Kambanda, it's 22nd of April 1994 as broadcast on Radio Rwanda and we only have the Kinyarwandan version.  I would ask that this be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ32. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ32 admitted)  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness G, do you have that in front of you? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	So what I would like to do is ask you to read to yourself, beginning on page 25 which is the second page of the translation, continuing until the middle of the last page, page 28.  If you could read that to yourself, then I am going to ask you some questions about what Prime Minister Kambanda said on 
	the 22nd of April. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Finished. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have just finished reading through.
BY MR. ROBINSON:  
Q.	Thank you very much Witness G.  It's true is it not that in the speech President Kambanda, excuse me, Prime Minister Kambanda said that the enemy we are fighting against is not a Tutsi, you are living with and who has nothing to do with RPF activities.  And he asked people not to be divided by regional or religious differences or to harm someone who had property that you coveted, and he said that the enemy is those making war fighting against the country.  He asked the population, "Please don't go and kill your neighbour.  Different ethnicities should not be a reason to burn his property.  And do not allow refugees in your homes if they have weapons and that security should check refugees to make sure there is none of the enemy among them.  And he asked the leaders of the political parties to convince their members not to attack innocent refugees who have nothing to do with the enemy; as to attack them is the worst crime. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
Mr. President, would counsel, please slow down for the benefit of the French booth.  Thank you. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, I am very sorry about that.
BY MR. ROBINSON:  
Q.	Mr. Kambanda was asking leaders of the political parties to convince their members not to attract innocent refugees who have nothing do with the enemy as to attack them is the worst crime.  And he asked that patrols be established and roadblocks set up to stop the infiltration by the enemy and the ID, the identification papers should be checked and people should be asked where they are going or coming from.  And the people should let them go if they comply. And if they hesitate people should take them to the authorities, but do not mistake a common inhabitant and not make confrontations on ethnicity or regionalism as this is the goal of the enemy.  And he did repeat that the enemy is not your neighbour who has nothing to do with the RPF, and that we should continue with our culture of assisting each other, and he asked the population to avoid attacking your neighbour or confronting one another.    Did he say those things on the 22nd of April 1994?  Excuse me; I think there was a translation error.  So the French people, I think the French booth got the date wrong.  So let me ask you again with these so that there is no confusion:  Did, the president -- do Prime Minister Kambanda say those things on the 22nd of April 1994?  
A.	Yes, he said those things, but Counsel, let me tell you: That the population was confused. We have these very elaborate speeches that were made by the MRND officials and authorities on one hand, and then on their hand, there is radio which threatening the population.  You have Kenton at the RTLM and that, and then you have what Kambanda said.  You would remember that in 1959 or `60, people went to seek refuge in churches, and they want and saw what had happened and they left.  Now they have come back to attack us.  Now, I think those churches were secret places and you need not pay attention to the churches any more. Attack then within the churches.  And so you see the people were confused or officials were delivering some wonderful speeches, but the radio would say what had they say subsequently making comments and detailing out what the authorities had spoken.  So well, to answer your question, yes, that is what he said in his speech.  Yes, indeed that is what he said in his speech. 
Q.	Okay, I think your point is well understood.  Now, if we could go on and you could look at the next document which point in Tab 92 of the Prosecutor's binders and it is Item 31 of in the document which was went to Hague. And it's on Kinyarwandan version of this.  It's a communiqué by the MRND signed by Mr. Nzirorera and Karemera on the 23rd of April 1994 and at this time I would like to offer this document as Exhibit D. NZ33.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ33 admitted) 
MR. WEBSTER: 
If I could enquire from the record if Mr. Robinson can tell us where that record originated? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President, as far as I know this document originated with the -- well it came to us from the Office of the Prosecutor and it has -- there is a K number from the Office of the Prosecutor.  It's signed by Mr. Nzirorera and Mr. Karemera, and I represent to you that they affirm that these are in fact their signatures, but where the Prosecutor got the document from, I don't know. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Perhaps I could half-way in that respect.  The K number indicates that it was recovered from Mr. Karemera's seizures when he was arrested.  This is one of the documents that he had in his possession at the time of his arrest. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you very much, Mr. Webster, I was unaware that this could be helpful

Mr. President, because this is a statement by the accused, I would like -- about almost two pages to have this read in its integrity rather than paragraphing it, and I would ask that the Kinyarwandan interpreter be requested to read this document so that the Trial Chamber has the full appreciation of it. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What is your estimation of duration of reading?
MR. ROBINSON:   
I was thinking no more than five minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So -- 
MR. ROBINSON: 
So, when the Kinyarwandan Interpreter is ready if he could begin reading this document and 
Witness G, if you have it in front of you, you can follow along this row.  Thank you. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Mr. President, this document is in Kinyarwanda and for purposes of interpretation, we would need, rather, the witness says he has the document.  So we do defer to the Court.  But if the Kinyarwanda booth has read this document, they would probably have to read it sight translated into French so that we can interpret into English.  So would need some time to prepare for that, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Would it be - are suggesting that the witness read the document which means it would translated simultaneously. 
Mr. Interpreter?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
It would be best Mr. President for the Kinyarwanda booth to sight translate the document into French and then we can interpret it from the English booth into English.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, I don't see any problem with that because the two languages of our Tribunal are French and English. 
MR. MORLEY: 
They are certainly, Your Honour.  But technically, I think the document has to be read in is form and translated simultaneously.  What is being proposed is that in its present form is not read.  It's interpreted as it were by reading the Kinyarwandan in the mind of the interpreter you can articulate French translation so that technically what -- the witness read the document or preferably the Kinyarwanda speaker who was within the translation booth read the document so that it is simultaneously translated into French.  The only difference which arises there is that the Kinyarwandan interpreter probably interprets direct into French.  So she would be the person doing the translation of the document as some. 
MR. PRESIDENT:   
That is the problem as far as I got it.  I don't understand why it was not acceptable for the witness to read it in Kinyarwanda so that there could be simultaneous interpretation. 
MR. MORLEY: 
	That would be the best option.  I am not objecting to that, I am just saying that a sight reading by the interpreter into French is probably not taken into account.  So that if the witness is invited to read the document to tell Mr. Robinson, may I ask that he read it slowly because that may help everyone. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Would that a procedure which facilitates interpretation?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Yes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay, thank you very much.  Mr. Witness, we are going to invite you to read the document slowly so that it can be simultaneously translated into the other languages of the Tribunal.  
THE WITNESS: 
May I begin?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. 
THE WITNESS:
Senior officials of the MRND having examined the situation reigning in the entire country be it on the political level, or the battle field, believe that it is necessary to tell the members of their party the following:  Officials of the MRND congratulate the Rwandan armed forces for their bravery and their devotion that hey have demonstrated on the battle field.  Party officials also invite all Rwandans particularly members of the MRND party to redouble their efforts in support of the armed forces.  MRND leaders request all members of the party to do more, to support all government or actions so as to restore security and peace throughout the territory of this country.  MRND leaders congratulate the youth wing of the MRND party also known as the Interahamwe as well as members of the national Interahamwe committee for their cooperation with the population with a view to support the national armed forces in order to face the enemy who is persistent in pursuing its goals.  Those goals and exterminations of our Rwandans. The RPF criminal objectives as well as its terrorist actions must not discourage our youths.  They must therefore continue to safeguard security by making sure peace and tranquility reign among all Rwandan citizens.  Therefore presence of enemies must be detected and their action must fail everywhere where they are located in Rwanda.  However, that process should not serve as pretext to attack or mistreat innocent people, innocent people who have nothing to do with this war.  Their actions therefore must aim to restore security throughout the country.  Senior officials of the MRND request the national committee of the Interahamwe to closely follow some of the actions carried out by certain Interahamwe.  Some seem to fail in their responsibilities.  Normally their responsibilities are to look for peace and keep security for Rwandans.  In the same line, senior officials of the MRND party has all members of thee MRND party in particular, the Interahamwe to remain steadfast in their objectives for peace and unity, which objectives were set up by the father of our nation. Senior officials of the MRND take advantage of this opportunity to publicly denounce all criminals who pass themselves as Interahamwe.  Those officials request the Interahamwe to identify those persons, those persons who not seek peace, those persons who want to blame their crimes on the Interahamwe.  Senior officials of the MRND are requesting all the people who are concerned of peace to denounce the activities of any person that cause harm to lives of their neighbour.  Any persons wish to act in their personal interest in this troubling situation should also be denounced.  Here we are referring to all those people who have stolen the property of others.  Taking advantage of this war situation, the war which was provoked by Inyenzi, Inkotanyi.  MRND officials request and all Rwandans not to attack one another as they are victims of an attack coming from somewhere else.  We ask them not destroy their property or the property of their neighbours.  The enemy who has attacked Rwanda is well-known.  That is the enemy we must face and by doing that we shall achieve ultimate victory.  Those who aggress  innocent members of the population because of their ethnicity or in order to loot their property, however, they be even if turns out they are members of our party, must be denounced. We condemn their behaviour and we inform the -- authorities that they must stop them, put an end to their actions.  Shameful actions which tarnish the image of our country.  Peace be with you, done at Kigali 23 April, 1994.  On behalf of the MRND Joseph Nzirorera national secretary, Counsel Edouard Karemera, first vice president. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness G.  Witness G; were you aware of this -- communiqué 1994? 
A.	I don't believe that have ever heard this communiqué.  Perhaps it was announced, I just may not have been listening.
Q.	I am going to ask you to look at the next document in my -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, 1:35, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Very well, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we should take the luncheon break now and resume at the usual time. 
(Court adjourned at 1335H)
(Pages 24 to 34 by Petrus Chijarira)



























(Court resumed at 1540H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.  I think we can resume. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness G. 
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness G, I am going to be asking next that you be shown Document No. 32 on the list of documents faxed to The Hague which is a Radio transcript of a communiqué issued by the national committee of the Interahamwe on the 25th of April l994.  And while that's being located for you, I would offer it as Exhibit D. NZ34? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ34 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, do you have that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And looking at the first paragraph of the first page, and then continuing on until the middle of the second page, does that appear to you to be a communiqué that was issued on behalf of the national committee of the Interahamwe? 
A.	I believe I heard this communiqué. 
Q.	And it is signed or issued in the names of Nos. 1 and 3 on Exhibit P. 9? 
A.	Yes, No. 1 and No. 3. 
Q.	And does it indicate that the leadership of the Interahamwe had met with the préfet of Kigali and the chief of staff of the Rwandan Army as well as the gendarmerie? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And does it call on the members of the Interahamwe to do certain things? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And on the second page, are there four things listed that are calling on the Interahamwe members to do? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And could you tell us what those four things are? 
A.	First off all, they are asking that the human being be respected.  Acts of violence must come to an end and secondly, those who are suspect and are arrested at roadblocks or in houses must be taken to the commune authorities -- commune or préfectural authorities.  No. 3, the verification of documents or checking of documents at roadblocks must be done in such a manner which is clear and in respect of discipline.  No. 4, the action -- actions for assistance provided by the Red Cross facilitates the work of the Red Cross and other humanitarian organisations to make their work easier, providing assistance to the wounded by taking them to hospitals.  These organisations should carry out their activities without any distinction regarding the people in any way whatsoever.  And this was a communiqué from the committee of the Interahamwe, and it was requesting that these activities be carried out in order to bring back or restore peace and the security.  And this document is signed by No. 3 and No. 1 -- number 1 and No. 3. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  And, Witness G, did you agree with these objectives? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, if you could be shown document No. 33, on my list of documents sent to The Hague? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, this is also a communiqué of the MRND.  It's dated the 27th of April l994, and it's signed by Mr. Karemera, and from the K-number.  On the top -- it appears that it was probably also taken from -- seized from his property when he was arrested.  Mr. Webster can correct me if I am wrong about that.  And I would ask that this communiqué be marked as D. NZ35, and admitted into evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ35 admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	And Witness G, this is relatively short, and I will ask you for your assistance, if you could slowly read this document so that we can understand its contents in English and French.  Thank you.  I mean for you to read it aloud.  
A.	"Communiqué issued by the MRND party.  Fellow Rwandans, Dear party members, I am expressing my greetings to you once again, wishing you peace and unity.  It is peace and unity which once again will enable us to carry out the development tasks which we need to accomplish so much.  

Dear party members, as the leadership of our party has always asked you, the officials of your party are once again calling upon you to work towards the attainment of this objective.  In other words, the objectives of peace and unity.  We are making this request of you, hoping that you will always be exemplarily in your actions, in respect to the pursuit of efforts being made to restore security in your respective neighbourhoods in the shortest time possible.  We thank you the MRND Interahamwe for having properly understood the message given to them.  On the 26th of April l994, we also wish to thank the national Interahamwe committee which has not hesitated in propagating these instructions.  This committee has not failed to issue orders such that the youths of the party are shown the policy to follow during these difficult times.  
However, everything has not gone as successfully as we would have hoped.  According to the reports reaching us, we are being informed that certain individuals are using the clothing and insignia of the MRND party in order to commit reprehensible acts by committing killings or looting.  

Once again, we denounce the actions carried out by these individuals, and are requesting the Interahamwe to arrest such individuals or show them -- point them out to the security forces or the forces of law and order.  

Dear party members, in the message we delivered to you on the 25th of April l994, we asked all the officials of the MRND at all levels to lead the way and work together with one another in order to seek ways and means of putting an end to the killings and looting which are being carried out in our country.  We urgently urge the MRND officials at préfectoral level to implement these instructions forthwith.  We also request you to contact the authorities and give them your support, in order to implement the government programme.  Inter alia the government has decided to go down to the ground and visit all the préfectures.  During that tour, the members of government will examine together with the members of the population, ways and means of restoring peace and security without any further ado.  

Peace be with you.  Done in Kigali on the 27th of April l994.  For and on behalf of the MRND, 
Counsel Edward Karemera, Vice Chairman. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness G.  And if you can just go back to the document for one second.  I believe there was there was a translation error on the date in the fourth paragraph.  Is that date, 23rd of April l994? 
A.	In the last paragraph it's the 25th of April. 
Q.	And then two paragraphs above that, is the date the 23rd of April? 
A.	The two dates featuring in this communiqué, in the third paragraph, I see 26th April 1994, and in the last paragraph I see 25th of April l994. 
Q.	Okay, looking at the third paragraph, maybe I am seeing 23rd of April, but can you, maybe there's something about the copy that makes it difficult.  Can you look at that more closely and tell me if it's the 23rd or the 26th? 
A.	I think the 23rd of April. 
Q.	Okay, thank you, very much, Witness G.  Now, I want you now to return to your movements after the 19th of April.  You told us you attended the ceremony in Butare on the 19th of April, and then later you returned to Kigali.  So, can you give us approximately the time that you returned to Kigali, about how many days after the 19th? 
A.	I returned for the first time to Kigali on the 23rd, 24th, or 25th, there about. 
Q.	And did you make any trips to Gisenyi before then from Butare? 
A.	No, before the 25th of April, no. 
Q.	When you travelled from Butare to Kigali, did you have any kind of escort? 
A.	From Butare to Kigali, no. 
Q.	Were there any other Interahamwe travelling with you? 
A.	No. 
Q.	So, you just drove by -- did you just drive by yourself?  I will repeat my question.  Did you just drive by yourself? 
A.	The first time when I went to Kigali I was with one of my cousins.  We were in his vehicle. 
Q.	And during that first trip from Butare to Kigali, did you stop in Gitarama and speak with No. 9? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And did No. 9, tell you that the Interahamwe were now fighting the RPF in Kigali, and they had stopped killing Tutsis? 
A.	No.  He informed me that the Interahamwe were being sent to the war-front because in Kigali there were no more killings that were going on.  The killings had practically stopped in Kigali. 
Q.	And in fact, when you arrived in Kigali, did you observe that the Interahamwe were now participating in the war efforts? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And when you went to the residence and bar of No. 6, did you notice that the Interahamwe were all wearing military uniforms? 
A.	Yes, many Interahamwe were wearing military uniforms. 
Q.	And did No. 6 inform you that they had rocket launchers and they were now starting to attack the RPF positions? 
A.	I don't remember that. 
Q.	And during your first visit to Kigali when you met -- when you were present during an address by Colonel Bagosora?  Is it true that he also said that it was necessary to have no more massacres because now it was just war? 
A.	I do believe he said that. 
Q.	And did he also say that even if there were Tutsis left in Kigali, they were insignificant, and it was necessary to focus on the war? 
A.	I don't remember.  But I think I heard him say that, "Now, that the killings have come to a halt, we must focus on the war.  The killings had stopped in Kigali." 
Q.	Now, I am going to direct your attention to another document in my list of documents faxed to 
	The Hague, and that is No. 35.  And if you could be shown document 35 which has the words 
	"Afriqué Centralé" at the top and Prosecution Exhibit 474.  This is an interview with No. 1, published in Afriqué Centralé.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
And at this time, Mr. President, I would offer this as Exhibit D. NZ36. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ36 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have the document. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And if you could read it briefly -- oh, have you seen this document before? 
A.	This is the first time. 
Q.	If you can take a minute to look at the documents, and my question at the end, after you have read it will be, whether or not, No. I number was making public statements indicating that the Interahamwe were fight side by side with the army? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
If I could invite Mr. Robinson to tell us a bit more about this document before the witness continues his answer.  What is it?  Where is it from?  An approximate date and so on and so forth? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, thank you, Mr. President, I will do that.  The document that states as indicated, "A story from 
	13th of May in Kigali by the AFP news agency.  And it was Prosecution Exhibit 474 in the Nahimana trial.  And, I believe that my source of this document was from the registry or perhaps -- I believe it was from the registry, but I am not positive exactly. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness G, when you read through this document, if you could tell us whether or not No. 1 is indicating that the Interahamwe are fighting side by side with the army? 
A.	Counsel, this document is extremely difficult to read and I don't want to make anything up.  I am having difficulty reading it.  It's not very legible. 
Q.	Okay, I appreciate.  I am sorry about that.  I am going to ask the assistance of the French booth, if they can read one paragraph from this document and that paragraph is contained on the left-hand side of the first page.  It's the third paragraph from the bottom, and it says; it begins with "Nous avons", and if the French interpreters can read that one paragraph, I will appreciate that? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"We took weapons from the enemy and the army gave us weapons to ensure the civil defence, explains 
Robert Kajuga stating that the massacres were not organised by his movement." 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	 Witness G, now if you could be shown document No. 36 from the package of material faxed to 
	The Hague. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
And Mr. President, this is from a transcript of a radio broadcast, Radio Rwanda, on the 15th of 
	May l994, in which No. 1 is being interviewed by a correspondent from Radio France International.  And I will offer this document as D. NZ37. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The source of the document? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
It's from the Prosecution, and it's of transcripts of Radio Rwanda, cassette No. 981.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the K number?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
K0283902. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ37 admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	Witness G, if you could read this document to yourself, it is very brief. 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And could you tell us what No. 1 is saying about the role of the Interahamwe during this interview? 
A.	He is saying that the Interahamwe are there to assist the army.  And that if they are disturbing the army, and the army asked them to move, they will move.  He also explains that there are places of secteurs where the army cannot go, and the RPF would attack that area, and the Interahamwe would defend it.  He is explaining that they are trying to assist the army on the battle front. 
Q.	And is that consistent with your own observations of what was going on in Kigali, in late April and 
	May of l994? 
A.	Yes.  When I arrived in Kigali during my first visit, at one point when I was at No. 6's place, I was told by No. 6 that they are going to send people to the front.  Those people were sent, in fact, to reinforce the army. 
Q.	Now, also during your first visit to Kigali, I understand that there was a meeting of the Interahamwe committee with General Dallaire, in which the issue of evacuating people from the Mills Coline Hotel was discussed.  Is that correct? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	And as I understand it, the Interahamwe committee was in favour of assisting in those evacuations, assuming that evacuations of people in the RPF zone could also take place, correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And, I would like you now to take a look at document No. 38 in the group of documents that I have sent to you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
And at this time, Mr. President, I would like to offer this document.  This is an interview with 
Mathieu Ngirumpatse on the radio.  And it's K number 0149986.  It's the 18th of May l994.  And I would ask that this be admitted as D. NZ38. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ38A admitted)
MR. ROBINSON: 
May it please be admitted, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh yes, I thought I said it earlier. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I am sorry, maybe I didn't hear.  
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q. 	Witness G, I just want to direct your attention to the very first page of this document where 
Mr. Ngirumpatse is speaking.  And I would like you to read that to yourself, just that one paragraph above the 5.1 minutes.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
While the witness is reading the document, perhaps Mr. Robinson, can indicate the date of the transmission according to his record. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  That would be the 18th of May l994. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, also if you could just look on the second page under 6.9 minutes, a small paragraph where 
	Mr. Ngirumpatse is speaking. 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And, is it correct that Mr. Ngirumpatse was urging -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
If I could ask one other point of clarification, I apologise.   And perhaps, Mr. Robinson could indicate whether this is being transmitted from Kigali, or from Gisenyi or where in Rwanda, the speech is being delivered. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I am afraid I don't know the answer to that question. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, in this interview with Mr. Ngirumpatse, is it true that he is encouraging that people at the Hotel Mills Colline be allowed to be evacuated? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And as far as you know, they were successfully evacuated, corrected? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, I also want to ask you some other question about your time in Kigali.  And actually, these bits of questions will cover all of your three visits to Kigali.  During that period, any of the three visits, did you go to the area near the Canadian embassy in Kigali? 
A.	No. 
Q.	The Canadian embassy was located in an area that was not far from the home of number -- item No. 8 on P. 8.  Correct? 
A.	Yes, even close to my office.  The place I worked was so close. 
Q.	And I thought that I had understood that one -- that at least in one of your trips to Kigali, you had gone to retrieve some items from the residence of No. 8 on P. 8? 
A.	Yes, I went there. 
Q.	And were there any officers of the presidential guard located at that residence when you returned in any of your three trips to Kigali? 
A.	Those presidential guard elements were there at the house working as guards well before the 
	6th of April l994. 
Q.	Yes, I understand that.  And then when you returned to Kigali after the 6th of April, were there any of the presidential guards still at that location? 
A.	There were two. 
Q.	And could you tell us their names if you know? 
A.	Frankly, I didn't know their names.  I could recognise their faces. 
Q.	Do you know whether any one of them had anything to do with the roadblock in that area, after the 6th of April? 
A.	I don't know who set up that roadblock.  The fact remains that when I went back to Kigali in April l994, there was a roadblock.  It was on the road leading from the US embassy.  But that person's home was not right on that road where the roadblock was.  The roadblock was manned by guards from around that area.  More specifically, the roadblock was located just next to the house of Mr. Ambroise Mulindangabo (phonetic), who was, at that point in time, minister of planning. 
Q.	Were you aware of any roadblocks on a street called Rue de Kageri?  And I represent to you that I believe that's the name of the street on which Bank Alpine (phonetic) and the Canadian embassy was located? 
A.	If that's the name, yes, I know that one.  
Q.	And where there roadblocks on that road after 6th of April? 
A.	I know about the roadblock that I explained, but I don't know if there was another one set up.  I don't know if there was another roadblock on that particular road. 
Q.	And did you have any information of a roadblock being located near the Canada embassy? 
A.	To tell you the truth, I didn't go all the way to the Canadian embassy.  I went to No. 8's house on 
	Exhibit 8.  I went inside the building and I walked in.  And then I went back. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you, very much, Witness G.  Now, turning to the times after you had gone to Kigali and returned to Butare, there came a time when you took some trips to Gisenyi, correct? 
A.	Yes, at one point, I went to Gisenyi. 
Q.	Was there a time that you made a day trip to Gisenyi with a friend and returned to Butare the same day? 
A.	That would have been impossible.  I went to Gisenyi and I spent two nights there, no more. 
Q.	Now, when you travelled to Gisenyi, you have told us before that that was in the second half of June.  Correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And between your last trip to Kigali and your first trip to -- and your trip to Gisenyi, were you involved in the drafting or signing of any communiqués issued by the organisation in P. 9? 
A.	Which Exhibit P. 9?
Q.	I was asking you if you were involved in any communiqué issued by the organisation that is listed at the top of Exhibit P. 9? 
A.	I don't recall. 
Q.	I am going to ask that you be shown document No. 37, from the list of documents that were sent to 
	The Hague? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
And at this time, Mr. President, I would offer this exhibit as D. NZ39.  This is an excerpt from 
	RTLM cassette No. 0111 provided by the Prosecution, bearing K-number, K0140212. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ39 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And Witness G, I would like you to read this page, this first half of it and then I am going to ask you some questions about it when you finish.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
If I can just inquire, if Mr. Robinson is putting this forward as a broadcast on a specific date, if he can give us a date.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, thank you, Mr. Webster.  This was on the 14th of June l994. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, do you know anything about this communiqué? 
A.	I know that, at that time, Robert was in Butare.  My mother was in Butare for some treatment, and he was visited by a number of people including Sekiba (phonetic) and some other heads of secteurs.  I believe that Nzabanderura André had a problem in Kigali.  Now, when Robert left Kigali -- when he left Kigali, he left behind all documents and stamps belonging to the association to -- or left with Mr. Nzabanderura.  So, number 6, on P. 9, had asked Nzabanderura to hand over all those documents and stamps to him.  And the other didn't want to give the documents to No. 6.  So, No. 6 used a weapon to get the weapons (sic) from him.  So Nzabanderura purportedly gave back or handed back all the documents and stamps of the organisation to No. 6.  So when they came, they visited No. 1 and also reported about the threats from No. 6.  Now, as far as the communiqué is concerned, I do not remember that we drafted, signed and sent a communiqué to the RTLM.  I have no recollection of that. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, correction from the interpreters.  There was no reference of "mother" at the beginning of his answer.  We heard "mother" instead of "Robert".  So, it's Robert, that was mentioned at the beginning of his answer.  Thank you, sir. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And Witness G, can you just tell us, what is the text of the communiqué in the first two paragraphs of this page above the list of names? 
A.	Do you want me to read it?  
Q.	If you can summarise it that would be better. 
A.	The communiqué called on the Interahamwe of the MRND, in Kigali-town and Kigali-rural, and those in other préfectures to return to their secteurs by the latest, on 24th June l994, and await further instructions.  He also calls on them to bring along the tools they had received.  The committee noted that some honest Interahamwe continued to behave properly at the battle front as they assist the Rwandan Army.  He therefore avails himself of the opportunity to extend special thanks to them and calls on them to continue to be brave.  The communiqué is signed by those listed below.  No. 1, Nzabanderura, Tharcisse, No. 5 and Mr. Sekibeya (phonetic) Joseph - Seribasi (phonetic) Joseph.
Q.	And did you agree with the content of this communiqué or do you agree with -- at the time was this also your sentiments? 
A.	No, (sic) I approve of the contents of the communiqué.

1642H 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'm now going to start to ask him about some other topic.  Would this be a decent time to take a break, or would you like me to continue?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
In terms of overall prospects, what -- how much more time do you think you have?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I think I may be very close to finishing by the end of the day today.  Although I don't expect I will actually be able to finish.  There's one -- I wanted to play the -- some portions of the Petit Kigali video and ask some questions, and I'm told that that's not available, but I think I'll be very close to finishing before the end.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you.  We can take the mid-afternoon recess.  

Yes, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  Just one housekeeping matter, and we wouldn't have to raise it when we come back.  It's in regard to one of the exhibits that was entered.  I'm referring to D. NZ38, and I believe Mr. Robinson made available the French and the Kinyarwanda transcripts.  It goes back and forth between the two languages, but there is an English translation that we have in our exhibit folder, and I'll indicate that it can be found at tab 185.  And the specific portions that Mr. Robinson entered as D. NZ38 can be found at K numbers K0344590 to K0344605. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, would you like to exhibit that as -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I would.  Perhaps the document that I used in French and Kinyarwanda can be 38A and those K-numbers can be 38B. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, I make the (inaudible).  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ38B admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take the recess now. 
(Court recessed from 1645H to 1705H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are now ready to proceed.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, directing your attention to your travels in the second half of June, from Butare to Gisenyi, is it correct that you were given a Pajero jeep to drive by the préfet of Butare?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And who was the owner of this jeep?  
A.	According to the log book, the jeep belonged to a non-governmental organisation which was French, and its registration mark started with "IT," which means temporary import.  
Q.	And when you travelled to Gisenyi, did you have an escort?  
A.	When I went to Gisenyi, the driver who was driving that jeep was a member of the bodyguard team for number 1 under P. 9.  
Q.	And were you accompanied by any other Interahamwe?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	How many Interahamwe were in your party?  
A.	I think there were three.  
Q.	And were they armed?  
A.	I think only one of them was armed.  
Q.	And were you armed at any time that you were in Gisenyi?  
A.	Myself, no.  
Q.	Now, I want to direct your attention to the time when Robert Kajuga was evacuated to Gisenyi.  Were you armed at all during that time?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Now, in Gisenyi, did you know a person by the name of Omar Serushago?  
A.	Yes, I knew him.  
Q.	And what was your understanding of his function within the Interahamwe, if any?  
A.	I did not know him as -- in Gisenyi as an Interahamwe, because when I went to Gisenyi to see the members of the executive and the -- of the Interahamwe and the Interahamwe members.  I didn't see him.  
Q.	So how did you know him then?  
A.	Well, I knew him from long ago, even before the establishment of the Interahamwe.  I knew him as someone in Gisenyi, and this was through a great friend of mine who was a native of Gisenyi.  
Q.	And was -- what was Mr. Serushago's occupation, as far as you know?  
A.	I told you that he was a businessman.  That's all I know about him.  
Q.	Was he a money changer?  
A.	Yes.  Yes, he did that as well.  
Q.	And to your knowledge, did he have any position within the Interahamwe in Gisenyi?  
A.	As far as I know, no.  
Q.	To your knowledge, was he a trustworthy person?  
A.	You know, he wasn't really my friend.  I didn't have any business with him as such.  I saw him, as you say, as a money changer in Gisenyi.  That's all.  I didn't have any occasion to be of -- to have any particular interest in him.  
Q.	Do you know when he was ever -- do you know if he was ever present in the hotel room where Robert Kajuga was staying in Gisenyi when you were there?  
A.	To my knowledge, when I went to see number 1 in his room at the Meridien Hotel, I didn't see that Serushago.  
Q.	Now, I'm going to read you a small portion of the testimony of Omar Serushago, on the 26th of November of the year 2000 in the trial of Ferdinand Nahimana, Hasa Ngezi (phonetic) and Jean Bosco Barayagwiza, and this is at page 47, on line 1.  He says that he saw you in a room visiting Kajuga, and this is what he said.  He said, "His escort comprised several people.  I recognised two of them, a person called *********(phonetic) and another one called ********(phonetic)."  

And then he was asked the question:  "Was Witness G in a uniform on that particular occasion?"  

And he answered:  "No?"  

And then he was asked:  "Was he armed on that occasion?"  

And he answered:  "Yes, he was armed."  

Now, is that testimony accurate as far as you're concerned?  
A.	The testimony is not true.  
Q.	And, Witness G, I'll tell you that it's my -- it's our case that we agree with you, and, in fact, we believe this person is a pathological liar.  But I want to ask you about one other thing he said about you so that we can confirm the same.  

Now, he was asked -- this is also on the 26th of November 2000, at page 49, line 11.  This is Mr. Serushago being questioned, and he was asked:  "Going back to the events before the 6th of April, had you ever met Witness G in Kigali before that date?"  

And his answer was:  "Yes, I saw him."  

And then he was asked:  "And was that on several occasions or many occasions or just once or twice?"  

And he says:  "I saw him on many occasions."  

And then he was asked:  "Did Witness G tell you, on the occasions when you and he met, that he was planning to kill Tutsis because they were Tutsis?"  

And this answer was:  "I'll answer you the way you would want me to.  You'd understand that he was involved in the preparation of the genocide, and in that sense, he killed.  He really killed."  

The next question:  "The question I want answered is whether he ever told you that he wanted to kill Tutsis because they were Tutsis.  

"Answer:  Yes.  He intended to kill the Tutsis, because within the framework of the preparation of the genocide, there was only one enemy, the Inyenzis, the Tutsis.  

"Question:  Mr. Serushago, did Witness G and you ever discuss this matter between the two of you?  Yes or no?  

"Answer:  Within the framework of the preparation of the genocide, we talked about it during all -- all the meetings which were held."  

And then there was a question from the president of the Trial Chamber:  "Now, during these meetings, did you ever hear Witness G say that he would like to kill Tutsi as Tutsi?"  

And Serushago answered:  "That is correct, Mr. President."  
MR. WEBSTER:
I have one concern, Your Honour.  It's a matter of fairness in procedure, because we had agreed amongst the parties that we would have reciprocal disclosure in this case, and I noticed nowhere on Mr. Robinson's list is there any reference to transcripts from -- from the person that he's referring to.  And I'm a bit at a loss because I can't read what Mr. Robinson is reading, and I can't see what comes before it or what comes after it.  And I would have preferred, and it would be much more fair, if he had indicated that.  He wouldn't have to copy it necessarily, but at least let us know where he's going to refer to in these transcripts so I can be familiar with it as he's reading it to the witness.  So I mean that's my concern, and if the Court could give us some guidance on this so that this awkward situation for us doesn't -- is not -- there's no recurrence of it.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I think that's fair, Mr. President.  I didn't intend on using this as an exhibit, and so I didn't call the Prosecutor's attention to it.  I would say that this is testimony they have available.  In fact, they disclosed it to us, but I can understand that Mr. Webster may not have it in the courtroom.  So in the future, I will make an effort to alert him to portions of a transcript that I would refer him to.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal)
MR. ROBINSON:
(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal)  
JUDGE SHORT:
And Mr. Robinson, speaking for myself also, where you are going to refer to previous transcripts, I'd appreciate it if you can provide the Bench with copies because I would want to follow you when you are referring the witness to particular portions of the transcripts.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I can do that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm just wondering if we need to redact any part of this because -- in fact, your answer to me probably should be redacted because it provides a method of identifying Witness G. 
MR. ROBINSON:
That's a good point, Mr. President.  I think we should redact that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar. 
MR. FRY:
So noted, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So my question and then the answer.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, I just want to ask you if, having heard this testimony, what Mr. Serushago said is accurate?  
A.	This is totally false.  
Q.	And I would point out again, Witness G, that it is our case also that this is totally false.  So please don't feel defensive about that at all.  

Now, I thought I heard you say that you were tired while the others were speaking.  Are you able to continue?  
A.	No, I was saying you are tired.  
Q.	Oh, you're right about that.  
A.	I was saying that you were the one who was tired.  
Q.	You're absolutely right about that, but I will go on.  Now, if we could now turn to the month of July 1994.  Is it true that you left Gisenyi and spent an evening in Gikongoro and then spent some time in Cyangugu?  
A.	Yes, that's true.  
Q.	And as the war progressed and the people were leaving Rwanda, you, yourself, went into exile at the beginning of July -- or perhaps in the middle of July; correct?  
A.	Yes, that's correct.  
Q.	And is it true that you intermittently crossed back into Rwanda up through August of 1994?  
A.	Came back to Rwanda?  
Q.	Yes.  When you were in -- 
A.	In August 1994?  Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.  Yes, I would come back in from time to time because there was no border.  I think it was Operation Turquoise at that point in time.  
Q.	And for -- after August of 1994, through January of 1995, were you in Zaire with your family?  
A.	Yes, that's correct.  
Q.	And then were you actually in refugee camps there?  
A.	I was living in Bukavu town. 
Q.	And would you say that after spending your time in Bukavu and seeing the people suffering at refugee camps, that you became somewhat disillusioned about what had gone on in Rwanda earlier in 1994?  
A.	Although I was living in Bukavu, I had friends, relatives, and friends (sic) living in the refugee camps, and it wasn't very far from the refugee camps.  Be it the refugee camps in Goma or Bukavu, I went into those camps quite frequently.  
Q.	And the conditions in those refugee catches were horrible, weren't they?  
A.	Yes, that's true.  
Q.	And did you find it offensive that the leaders of Rwanda were, in fact, moving their families to other African countries and Europe while people were suffering in the refugee camps at Bukavu and Goma?  
A.	I would like to tell you that those people were not happy to stay in Bukavu.  Some of them wanted to go back to Rwanda, and they wanted to go back, and there were some of them who were killed because of that.  They were held hostage in the refugee camps in Bukavu.  Let me give you an example.  At the time when Rwanda was changing its money from the old to the new notes, people had millions in the refugee camps, and what did the leaders say to the people in the refugee camps?  They said, "No, you stay with this money; you cannot go back to Rwanda to change this money; you will be able to do so when you go back to Rwanda."  And some of the people began to cultivate fields in Bukavu and Goma.  In order to encourage them to continue that cultivation, they held rallies -- Kambanda and Sindikubwabo -- and they told the people, "Why are you going to cultivate the fields whereas in a month or two, you will have to be going back home?  You will not have time to harvest."  And this, in my view, was holding the population hostage.  
Q.	And so was it fair to say that when you were approached by the Office of the Prosecutor in 1996, and asked to cooperate, that these thoughts affected your decision to cooperate against those who had been in power in Rwanda in 1994?  
A.	Let me tell you, they invited me the first time around, and they asked me to help them understand what had happened in Rwanda, because this was a beginning for them, and they didn't know how to start.  And there was no one to tell them anything.  And somebody had told them that I was around.  That person was sent -- that person was sent to fetch me.  So when I reached there, there were no negotiations.  They asked me if I knew anything about Rwanda.  They knew that I was within an organisation, and they asked me questions, and I said that these are people who want to learn the truth.  So I said to myself, I'll tell them the truth.  I'm going to use this because there were people who were still languishing in the camps in Goma and Bukavu who were suffering and wanted to go back home.  I had this opportunity.  I had these people who wanted to know the truth, and I agreed to tell them the truth.

      1730H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And in addition to providing them with your knowledge of past events, did you also agree to collaborate with them in their ongoing investigations? 
MR. WEBSTER:
On this point, Your Honour, I'm not sure how far we're going with this line of questioning, but we are getting into an area that should be in closed session.  It's not simply a matter of protecting this witness's identity, but the investigative procedures of the Office of the Prosecutor.  Now, originally it was proposed that this entire session be in closed session, and Mr. Robinson quite aptly or deftly used some abhorrent internal communications to generate what we now have, a session that's completely open, which I think is good and in the public interest.  But when we move closer and closer to the investigative procedures of our office and this witness's identity, I think that the Court should consider the option of directing that this line of questioning take place in a closed session. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'm going to be very general about this and I am not going to ask any questions which would reveal this witness's identity in any way, and I'm not going to ask any questions that get into the details of the Prosecutor's operations, but I think it's definitely a matter of public interest and should be part of the public record.  The background of this witness's cooperation with the Prosecutor and the benefits that he's received from that as part of his overall credibility.  It can be done without compromising the identity of the witness or any details of the Prosecution's methods, and I'm proposing to do it that way.  If you see that I'm not doing it, then I think at that point you could consider closed session, but I believe that I can accomplish that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We think closed session is premature at this stage, but we will be attentive and see how you proceed, Mr. Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness G, is it true that in addition to providing the Prosecution with knowledge of past events, you also agreed to collaborate with them in their ongoing investigations? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And for that collaboration, you were paid more than (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) in cash by the Prosecution, correct? 
A.	And the document was under seal, so maybe you can go into it in closed session. 
Q.	I'm not asking you any of -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, the information listing the amount of the payments which was filed during the examination in-chief was filed under seal.  We have, in fact, ruled that the nature of the benefits was relevant, but the quantum was not.  We want to strike the term (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) and redact it. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, maybe we could revisit this issue, and I would ask the witness take his headphones off while we do that.  Can it be confirmed in The Hague that the witness doesn't have his headphones on?  Okay, I can see that it's confirmed. 

Mr. President, with respect to this, when the document was tendered under seal, we objected and I believe Mr. Rapp said that it could be possibly revisited, the necessity of this being under seal.  So, first of all, perhaps this would be a good time to revisit that.  My intention, since this document lists the date and the amounts of payments, I thought that it would be possible that perhaps someone could take this information and deduce something about the identity of this witness, and so I wasn't planning on asking that this witness -- that this document be unsealed, but I was planning to ask the witness the amount of -- the total amount of benefits as an alternative which I think is even more relevant.  And it seems to me that, first of all, the total amount of benefits that a witness has received is very relevant to the issues of bias of the witness and the witness's credibility.  For all we know, it could be $100, and I think that these amounts do not in any way identify the witness.  There is absolutely no way anybody could take from the amount of benefits he has received, that information, and identify who this witness is.  So I see no link between disclosure of the amount, and the identity of the witness. 

Now, with respect to relevance, I think this is a very important point that the amount of benefits received by a witness is relevant to the witness's credibility, directly relevant, and so I am asking that I be allowed to ask this question and have it answered. 
MR. WEBSTER:
If I could just respond briefly.  There is no dispute that this is a line of enquiry that Mr. Robinson is entitled to go into.  The question is whether it should take place in an open session or a closed session.  We are not objecting at this point to the relevance of the question; it is a question of how we should proceed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  You see, this matter was addressed to some extent in the examination in-chief, and so we think that there's a topic which can be addressed in cross-examination.  The interest, we think, should be preserved in terms of the relationship between what you can do in open session and in closed session.  We feel that details as to the actual amounts, be it the quantum of the sums, is a matter which you need to address in closed session if you intend to go into it.  But you can enquire as to the purposes of the commencement, what the general -- the general nature of the benefits that were received.  But if you intend to cross-examine on the specific amounts that were paid, we think that should be dealt with in closed session. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I didn't intend to cross-examine on specific amounts that were paid on specific occasions, but I would like to cross-examine on the total, or at least a range, so that I think that this is a matter of public interest that can't possibly lead to the identification of the witness's identity.  And so if we are only discussing whether this should be in closed or open session, if you look under Rule 78 and 79 about what can be the reasons for a closed session, it seems to me that there has to be some kind of a showing that they would lead to the identity -- the disclosure of the identity of the witness or some other finding in the interests of justice.  So the question that I just asked, and the amount that I referenced, cannot in any way be said to lead to the disclosure of the identity of this witness, and it is a matter of great public interest.  So by requiring me to do it in closed session, I feel that we are accomplishing nothing in terms of the identity of the witness and losing some value in terms of the transparency of the Tribunal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but Mr. Robinson, I don't have the exhibit before me, but I suspect that the figure that you put is the figure that was already in evidence. 
MR. ROBINSON:
That's actually not true. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I don't know. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I have the document if you'd like to see it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, I don't need to see it.  The question is that -- you are now putting something that is different to what was in evidence as challenging the accuracy of the account that has been put in evidence?
MR. ROBINSON:
No, actually, what I've done, what's in evidence contains dates and times -- dates and amounts, and what I have done is totalled them and given them an approximate figure. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but that's what I'm saying.  So the information that you are now trying to elicit in this way is already on the record under seal. 
MR. ROBINSON:
That's correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's the point.  But, no, you are now, through this question, putting information which is under seal in open session.  Is there anything you can ask questions about it, without the detail of the amount?  If you wish to go into the detail of the amount, that's a matter which we have already put under seal, and you said you are not opposing that exactly, and we think that is what should be -- the confidentiality of that is the only thing we feel we should preserve at this stage. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Let me see if I can do it that way.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G --
MR. ROBINSON:  
	Could he please be asked to put his headphones back on?  
MS. TALON:
Mr. President, the witness has put on his headset. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, in terms of the amount of cash that you have been paid by the Prosecution for your cooperation with them, is it fair to say that that is in the tens of thousands of dollars? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's the same question. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'm not revealing any of the amounts that you have said is under seal.  I'm getting a range.  I don't see how that can identify this witness in any way, or even refer to the document that's under seal.  Otherwise there's no way in the public record to know whether this witness received $10 or a million dollars.  That's an important element that has nothing to do with his identity. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we made another provisional order.  I think it would be better to proceed without -- again, we are looking at the time, we had better move into closed session now for this section of the cross-examination, and I think that might be the best way to proceed now. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I would like to put some other questions to the witness in open session and come back to this in closed session when I go into the other topics that I was going to ask for a closed session in.  But I would like to also ask about other, in general, not specific amounts, but of other benefits this witness has received in open session. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, is it true that the cost of your relocation for you and your family was paid by the Prosecution? 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I am now on my feet, and I'm remembering the last series of questions which were conducted by Mr. Rapp, which Your Honour may remember were in a leading form.  Your Honour may remember that Mr. Rapp led the witness on an aspect of his current circumstances, and Your Honour may remember that the evidence which then went on the record is that with regard to his present circumstances and how he got to be where he is now, is something that he is not permitted to answer any questions about.  Your Honour may remember that that is a function of his present circumstance. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But he can be cross-examined about that, if he can answer in cross-examination, that issue. 
MR. MORLEY:
Well, first of all, arguably not in open session, but secondly, Your Honour will recall that, without opposition from the Defence, this position was led from the witness, rather than being something that he was asked about.  In other words, it seemed to be placed before the Court, that this is an area that the enquiries by the Tribunal - and I use the word perhaps inelegantly - debarred. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, how much more time do you have?
MR. ROBINSON:
Perhaps about one hour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
One hour.  Okay, it's five to six.  We'd better take the adjournment now.  

Mr. Witness, it's approaching 6 o'clock and we have decided to take the recess at this time.  I remind you, as I have done on previous occasions, not to discuss the case or your testimony during this or in any other adjournment.  
THE WITNESS:  
	Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are now excused and you may leave. 
MR. WEBSTER:
One small item.  I have been asked by my colleagues at The Hague to inform the Court that when we excuse the witness at the end of the day, the technicians immediately start to dismantle their connection, and the lawyers up there feel disconnected because they would like to hear if anything else is going on.  So I was asked to convey to the Court, if you could provide some instruction that the connection should remain in place until we've completed our -- all of our business, not just excusing the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  I wasn't aware that (inaudible) I thought that would have been an automatic result of our continuation.  If it is necessary, I would direct that the transcription remains until we actually adjourn.  

We have one small matter to do.  We have decided to, once again, vary the scheduling order for the cross-examination of Witness GFJ, and we postpone that to commence on Friday morning at 8.45.  

Are there any other matters?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  I would like to be heard a little bit more about this issue of how much we can go into the witness's situation in light of the objections that he has -- the witness is expressing.  And I think it's a very important issue, and it's going to go beyond this one question that I've asked, and if it's not convenient to do it now, perhaps we could convene a little earlier than 10 o'clock tomorrow morning and discuss that.  But whatever your preference is, I have a little bit more I'd like to say about that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much time do you think it's going to take?
MR. ROBINSON:
My remarks will just take a few minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are proposing to commence at 9.30 in the morning.  

Mr. Webster?
MR. WEBSTER:
Nothing further from us.  We will be here at 9.30.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will start at 9.30 tomorrow morning. 
MS. TALON:
Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Registrar?  
MS. TALON:
We may need an order to the effect that the technicians be present for 8.30 The Hague time in order to follow tomorrow morning's proceedings. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We do not think that we should make that order.  There is a legal issue.  Counsel are present here who can manage it, and we don't have enough information to determine whether it is reasonable for us to make that order as far as The Hague is concerned.  I don't think that the integrity of the proceedings here will be adversely affected if the connection is not made, and so we decline to make the order. 
MS. TALON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  We are not sure if the technicians will be ready at 8 or available at 8.30 tomorrow morning.  Nevertheless, we will contact Mr. Afande to see what, if anything, can be done.  That is all we can say from The Hague, Mr. President.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, just for clarification, we have not ordered The Hague to be online tomorrow.  If it can be done, well, then, that would be a matter that you initiate at that end.  But we are satisfied that the integrity of these proceedings will not be adversely affected if the connections are not in place, and we will be proceeding whether or not you are online.  We will make certain that any decisions taken will be communicated to you. 
MS. TALON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Duly noted. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We will take the adjournment now.
MS. TALON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
(Court adjourned at 1805H)
