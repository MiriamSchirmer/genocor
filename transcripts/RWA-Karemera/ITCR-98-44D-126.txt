P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:  
Thank you, Mr. President.

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal of Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short, and Judge Gberbao Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Friday, the 16th of June 2006, for a continuation in the trial in the matter of the 
Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

The appearances are the same? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Actually, Mr. President, I would like to introduce the Trial Chamber to a new intern, who has just joined our team.  She's sitting to our very left.  Her name is Brittan Heller, that's 
B-R-I -- B-R-I-T-T-A-N, H-E-L-L-E-R, and she's also from the United States. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Welcome to the Tribunal, and I hope you have a good tour of duty while you are here.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How are you? 
THE WITNESS:
I think things got worse; I feel some pain in my stomach, but I will try to hang in there.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we are sitting today until 12:30; it's a half day today and we will see how things go.  

Mr. Robinson will continue with the examination.  I remind you that you remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
Mr. President, the first thing I would like to do is to introduce three transcripts that were referred to during the examination on the day before yesterday.  The first one would be the page 2 of the transcript of 31 January 2006 from the Ndindiliyimana case.  And I would offer that as Exhibit D. NZ151, and copies have been given to the registry and to Mr. Webster.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ151 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
The second is at page 13 from the first trial of this case on the 8th of April 2004, and I would ask that it be admitted as D. NZ152. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ152 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
And the third is page 39 from the transcript of this case on the 30th of March 2004, which I would ask be admitted as D. NZ153. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ153 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
WITNESS BTH,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness B --
MR. WEBSTER:
Just on a matter of housekeeping:  It would be helpful if Mr. Robinson would also give us the 
French text of these transcripts - or, any document that he's using because the record would be complete; I think we're losing track of keeping a bilingual record of all these exhibits.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, that's a good idea.  When I finish my cross-examination, I'll go back and print out French pages for all of these transcripts also.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, Witness BTH (Kinyarwanda spoken) 
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	I'm actually going to try to finish my cross-examination today, speed up a little bit, so we'll see how we do.  But if at any time you don't feel that you can continue or you don't understand my question, just let me know, because we -- even though we want to finish today, we also want it to be accurate.  

Now, I'm going to take you back to the 7th of April 1994, and you told us that you had gone briefly to Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house from Haguma's tea shop and you had remained there for a short time and then you returned to the teashop; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And then after that, Dusabimana had come to the Byangabo centre and had told the people there that it was necessary to kill the Tutsis and sent for Rukara as the first one to be killed; correct? 
A.	Yes, correct.  
Q.	And you told us that Rukara was killed in Byangabo centre and that a lot of people had gathered; correct? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And did you witness the murder of Rukara yourself personally? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Was the conseiller, Assiel Ndisetse, present when Rukara was killed?  
MR. ROBINSON:
And that's number 61 on the spelling list.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And did he do anything either to intervene to try to stop the killing or to encourage the killing? 
A.	He was at that location having a discussion with other persons and I did not seek to find out what they were talking about and what he was doing.  
Q.	Did it appear to you from his activities on the 7th of April that he was encouraging the killing or trying to dissuade people from killing?  
A.	I never had any discussion with him.  
Q.	Now, can you tell us where you went after Rukara was killed in Byangabo centre, where was the first place that you went? 
A.	We went up towards Lucien's house; however, in the meantime there was a footpath which went through Lucien's house towards our home.  So before we went to Muhinde's, I went home first -- that is, to my home and then we went on to Samvura's family home.  
Q.	So did you go to your home to get your gun? 
A.	Yes, I went home, collected my firearm.  
Q.	How did Michele get his firearm? 
A.	Yes, I collected my firearm.  
Q.	And did Michel Niyigaba also collect his firearm? 
A.	I did not have a firearm -- he did not have a firearm when we went up.  He sent someone later on to go and fetch his firearm.  
Q.	So did he accompany you to your house when you got your gun? 
A.	No.  
Q.	After you got your gun, did you proceed to the place where Lucien lived? 
A.	We had already gone past Lucien's house and we went on another path along the way.  
Q.	So did you get your gun after Lucien had been killed? 
A.	No, as a matter of fact, by the time I arrived the killers were already in his home.  I did not go into his home.  I simply went up along with the others.  
Q.	Okay, so after Rukara was killed then, you went to your home, you got your gun, and you rejoined the others at Lucien's -- in the area of Lucien's house; is that correct? 
A.	No, after the death of Rukara we went up towards Lucien's home.  The killers entered his home and killed him.  Then I went to my home, collected my firearm, and on my way back I met the killers who had already killed Lucien and we went up together.  
Q.	And how long was it that you were separated from the others?  How much time did it take to go get your gun and rejoin them? 
A.	A few minutes.  You see, the two homes are close to each other, so maybe some five minutes.  But if one used the short cut it would take less than five minutes.  
Q.	Now, when you rejoined the killers and started going up towards Samvura's house, can you tell us who it was that you rejoined?  Who -- who -- name -- name us some of the people who were going towards Samvura's house with you? 
A.	I can mention, among others, François Dusabimana; Michel Niyigaba; Saidi Gakuru; 
	Abdul Karim Gato; Jean-Damascène Habyarimana, alias Bagabo; Nteziyaremye, Rugumire; 
	Célestin Mbonankira, alias caporal; Gatama; Rwerekana; Sebunani; Iyamuremye; Jean-Bosco Ndyambaje alias Kadodozi and others whose names I no longer remember.  There was also one Théoneste Mwambutsa; Jean-Pierre Félix Ndayambage; Théogène Nsengimana; Noël Ndayisaba; Kinamba; and there was a young girl known as Zefa; and Épimaque Nshizirungu; Pierre-Celestin Kwitonda; Combero.  In fact, there were many people.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And Mr. President, most of those names are on the spelling list, but to the extent that they're not, we can supply the spellings.  I won't take the time now to do that.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Can you tell us if Kajelijeli was among the people that went up to Samvura's property with you? 
A.	No, he was not with us.
Q.	And can you tell us approximately what time of day it was when you went up to Samvura -- when you first went up to Samvura's property after the death of Lucien? 
A.	Between 8 and 9 a.m.  All those incidents occurred in the morning.  
Q.	Okay, thank you.  Now, when you got to the Samvura property, just to orientate the Trial Chamber, basically you are heading across the street -- across the road from where the -- from the side of the road where Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house is and you're heading in the direction -- it seems to be north; correct? 
A.	We left the main road and went up on the road leading to the national volcanoes or volcanic park.  
Q.	So if you're on the main road travelling towards Gisenyi, you went to the right; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  If one were going towards Gisenyi, the road would be to the right.  
Q.	Now, at the property of Samvura and the other Tutsis in that area, did you fire your gun? 
A.	Yes, some people were killed by bullets, others by grenades, and various methods were used in the killings.  
Q.	And I want to focus on what you particularly as an individual did at that location.  Did you fire your gun? 
A.	Yes, I did fire my gun at some point.  But at the very beginning, we threw stones and it all depended on the location at which the victims were. 
Q.	And during the course of the -- and that area where you were, that's part of the cellule of Rwankeli; is that correct? 
A.	It was, in fact, in two cellules.  As you go up towards the Busogo parish, to your left lies Busogo cellule and to your right Rwankeli cellule.  But all of those are within one secteur. 
Q.	And when you were going up and you were in the area where Tutsis were being killed, how many Tutsis did you personally kill with your gun? 
A.	In Rwankeli cellule we found six Tutsis at one location and I personally killed three of them with my firearm.  But given that all those six people were at the same location, I confess having played a role in their killings.  
Q.	And of the three people, who died from bullets fired by your gun, how many of them were women and how many of them were men? 
A.	There were men and women, two women and one young man.  
Q.	Now, do you remember when you testified at the first trial in this case, on the 8th of April 2004, you testified that you had personally killed five people:  Three men and two women?  Do you recall that? 
A.	Yes, I was accused of having killed those people, and a child was later added to that number -- adding up to six.  Well, I have already explained that I had to agree to having killed those six people.  But I personally killed three people and I have confessed -- given that I was present to the killing of the six people.  
Q.	When you testified at the first trial, you were asked how many people you had personally killed from your weapon, and you told us there were five.  Not -- you weren't asked what you were accused of, but what you did.  Now, can you explain to us why you gave that testimony during the first trial? 
A.	There is no difference between what I said when I came here for the first time and what I have just told you.  When people are killed in your presence, you are expected to confess having played a role or having participated in the killing.  By the way, I was present when those persons were being killed, so I cannot claim that I was in church or that I was attending a wedding.  
Q.	I'm going to read to you from your testimony from the first trial, this is on the 8th of April 2004, and it's at page 50.  And it was a question from the President of the Trial Chamber, Judge Vaz.  She said:  

"Mr. Witness, can you please tell us approximately how many people you killed?"

And your answer was, "About five."  

And then I asked you, "Witness (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover) of the five people that you killed at Rudatinya's compound area, how many of them were women?" 

And you said, "Two".  

And I asked you, "And how many were children?" 

And you said:  "There was no child among the five; the three others were two adult men and one young man."
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before the witness answers, the witness's pseudonym is BHT -- is BTH.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I redact the reference to the other pseudonym. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Can you tell us, Witness BTH, why have you reduced the amount of people that you personally killed from the first trial to this trial?  
A.	I did not reduce the number of people I killed.  I told you that I was accused of having killed those people.  So if one participated in some killings and people were killed and that one personally killed some of them, one is generally accused of having killed all the ten persons who died.  So that is what happens in Rwanda.  

In the course of that attack, my testimony was that five people were killed and I had forgotten to mention one child who was also present, making a total of five persons.  So I went to Rwankeli.  I was part of that attack; I participated in it.  Six persons were killed and, therefore, I cannot deny having been involved in those killings.  I did not kill all these persons myself, but I confess having played a role in the killing of those persons.  Now, whether I killed two or three persons, what really matters is that I played a role in the killings.  
Q.	Did Michel Niyigaba also kill some people at that location? 
A.	Yes, he killed some.  
Q.	And how long were you at that location before you proceeded to the next location? 
A.	I didn't check what time it was by my watch, but I would say about two hours.  We had to fight them and we ended up killing them and this took about two hours.  
Q.	And where did you go after those two hours? 
A.	We went towards the Busoga parish, but we did not get to the parish -- to the Busoga parish.  We stopped at Mumabanga. 
Q.	And was it the same group of people who was with you at Mumabunga? 
A.	I did not mention all the names of the persons who were with me.  I only mentioned the names which I could remember.  
Q.	But did those same people -- 
A.	I do recall that we went to Samvura's house and to Muhinde's house -- that is the whole group.  
Q.	And did that whole group then continue along to Mumabunga? 
A.	Some of them remained on the road.  The group was a big group and were spread here and there.  Tutsis living in Mumabanga all lived along the roadside.  
Q.	Was Michel Niyigaba with you when you went to Mumabanga? 
A.	Yes, I'm sure he was with us.  
Q.	And at Mumabunga was that the place where the person named Ingabire was killed? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And then after the killing in Mumabunga, did you proceed to Busoga parish? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Now, with respect to this individual, Ingabire, were you aware that he was the son of a woman by the name of Kiberwa? 
A.	Yes, I was personally aware of that and I believe that my companions also knew it.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And Kiberwa is K-I-B-E-R-W-A.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And I take it that you do not know who the father of Ingabire was?  
A.	I explained this to you already.  Most people did not know Ingabire's father or who he was.  I personally did not know clearly who Kiberwa's father was.  But it was held that Ingabire's -- Ingabire's father was Nzirorera because Ingabire was the brother of Nyirabidabari and I, therefore, knew that Ingabire's father was Nzirorera. 
Q.	Well, in fact, Witness BTH, Ingabire's father was not Nzirorera, and Kiberwa will come and testify to that fact.  But, in any event, it's true, is it not, that the family, Kiberwa, Ingabire and the daughter, Nyirabidabari -- which is number 70 on the spelling list -- were living in Kigali between 1991 and 1994?  
A.	No, I do not agree with you at all.  I assert here with all conviction that Ingabire died in Mabanga -- in Busogo secteur, Rwankeli cellule.  Now, as far as Nyirabidabari goes, she had fled and was no longer living in that area.  I agree that her mother lived in Kigali and you're right on that point.  
(Pages 1 to 8 by Jean Baigent)

































0930H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And I agree with you that Ingabire was killed on the 7th actually where you say he was killed.  But he was visiting his grandmother there for one week and he was, in fact, residing at that time in Kigali, do we agree? 
A.	I agree with you.  He ordinarily lived in Kigali, but at the time of his death he was in that location. 
Q.	And, in fact, you never saw Kaberwa in Mukingo from 1991 to 1994, correct? 
A.	He arrived in Mukingo and then returned to Kigali. 
Q.	But my question was with respect to Kaberwa, the mother, you never saw her in Mukingo from 1991 to 1994, correct? 
A.	I have just answered you.  I told you I would see her from time to time.  Sometimes she would arrive and then return to Kigali because she had a family in Mukingo. 
Q.	Witness BTH, I asked you that same question on the 14th of April of 2004, when you testified at this trial before, and you testified on page 46 that you had never seen Gabiro in Mukingo from 1991 through 1994.  Now which is correct? 
A.	Perhaps when I was answering your question, I could not remember well if I had seen him or her or not.  But now I remember that I would see her from time to time visiting Mukingo. 
Q.	I'm going to read you the question and answer.  And, actually, I was mistaken, it was Mr. Webster who asked you this question on the 14th of April during his redirect examination.  On page 46, he said, "What about Kaberwa?  

	Your answer: "Kaberwa lived in Kigali.  

	Question:  Did you ever see her in Mukingo during the period of 1991 to 1994?"

	 Your answer:  "No, I never saw her there during that period of time."

Now, what has happened in the last two years that has made your memory better than it was on the 14th of April 2004?  
A.	When you put a question to me, you give me a chance to reflect and remember, but thereafter, I remembered having seen her three times, and that he or she was waiting for a vehicle in Byangabo.  So I do not see what the problem is.  I agree I could have forgotten something.  Yesterday, for instance, and today I could recall a fact.  Besides, when I am asked lots of questions and not given a chance to think about them -- or, rather, given a chance to think about them, it gives me a chance to remember things. 
Q.	Now, at the time that Ingabire was killed on the morning of the 7th of April 1994, had you heard anything about instructions that he be killed? 
A.	I know that Michel told us that Nzirorera had issued an order that that child be killed. 
Q.	And he told you that before the child was killed? 
A.	He told me about it when they were turning towards the child's house.  When we turned towards the child's house, he told me that Nzirorera had said we should also eliminate that child.  I don't know if they had spoken about it on telephone or by some other means.  But he did tell me about it. 
Q.	Witness BTH, when you testified in this trial on direct examination, you testified that Michel Niyigaba told you that he had talked to Nzirorera on the phone.  So did he tell you that he had talked with Nzirorera on the phone or didn't he? 
A.	I have just said it, he told me they had spoken on the phone, only that I said I did not know where they had spoken by telephone. 
Q.	And when you testified on your direct examination, you told us that Niyigaba told you this information around 1:00 p.m., but we know that you left the Rwankeli area, at the latest, at 11 am. 
A.	I told you that at that time I did not have a wristwatch.  I am just making an estimate.  I told you that I had not looked at my watch.  So now when you ask me to make an estimate, I make an estimate.
MR. WEBSTER: 
Sorry to interrupt, but perhaps we can ask the witness to speak a little bit more slowly because I get the impression that the translation is not keeping pace with his responses.  And I say that in relation to the last two or three questions and answers. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay, thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And when you testified on direct examination in this trial on the 8th of June, you also said that when Michel Niyigaba told you about this telephone call, you were on the road going down from Busogo parish.  But now you tell us you are on the road going up, correct? 
A.	I never said we were coming from Busogo.  You did not quite understand me.  
Q.	Well, the English translation said that you were on the road going down from Busogo parish.  Perhaps there was some difference in the translation.  Now you claim that Michel Niyigaba had spoken with    Mr. Nzirorera on the telephone and that he first advised you of this telephone conversation while you were on your way between the killings in Rwankeli and the location in Mumabanga.  But it is a fact, is it not, that from the time you left the tea shop and Rukara was killed to the time that Michel told you this, he had no access to a telephone because he was with you the whole time except for the few minutes when you were at your house getting your gun and he was at Lucien's house? 
A.	I would like to ask you a small question.  When the killers were at Lucien's house, I never mentioned Michel Niyigaba's name as one of those present at Michel's house.  Moreover, when I went to Rwankeli cellule Michel was not there, he was in Busogo.  In addition, these secteurs share borders.  There is just a road separating the secteur.  So when I was at Rwankeli I could not know what was happening in Busogo secteur.  So when we left Rwankeli all we did was cross the road to get to Busogo.  So I would like to tell you that throughout this period Michel Niyigaba was not joined to the hip with me. 
Q.	Well, Witness BTH, I suggest you are contradicting yourself because I was careful to ask you at each step of the way whether Michel Niyigaba was among the people who were with you, and you told us he was one of the people killing in Rwankeli with you and that he went with you from Lucien's to Rwankeli, and he went with you from Rwankeli to Mumabanga.  So now you appear to be contradicting yourself and say that he was in Busogo.  The fact is that Michel Niyigaba had no access to a telephone from the time you saw him that morning until the time you claim he told you about this phone call.  
A.	I gave you the following answer.  I think I never contradicted myself.  I told you that at Samvura's house when we went to kill the Tutsis, all the Tutsis lived together.  But I tell you between the houses of the Tutsis, there was just a road separating the two cellules.  When you are on one side of the road, you are in Rwankeli cellule, whereas on the other side of the road you would be in Busogo cellule, which means that when we were at Lucien's house, I went to my own house for a short period.  I don't know if he was elsewhere, but when I subsequently saw him, we went up together.  I remember that when we arrived in Rwankeli, Niyigaba threw a grenade and the Rwankeli Tutsis crossed the road to Busogo.  They went to a hill, we fought them.  And when we continued to fight, they scattered to hide in various houses.  But I would say that wherever we went, Michel Niyigaba was not necessarily with me.  Therefore, I cannot claim to have seen him constantly.  And, besides, I reiterate that when I went to Rwankeli, I was not with Rwankeli (sic), he had remained in Busogo.  It is just that the two areas are very close to one another.  When we were done with killing, we gathered at a place and then went up again.  However, I was not always with Michel Niyigaba.  So I was not wrong.  

	It is therefore Michel Niyigaba who could perhaps testify to the circumstances in which he spoke to Nzirorera, but the fact that he spoke to me -- the fact is that he spoke to me about this phone call.  Yet I cannot attest as to his movements, all of his movements.  Mostly we were together, but I cannot testify in detail as to his movements. 
Q.	Well, you are suggesting that Michel Niyigaba borrowed a telephone from one of the Tutsi in Busogo or Rwankeli secteur and phoned Mr. Nzirorera in the middle of the attack? 
A.	Now, you are asking me to speculate.  I cannot speculate.  If I start speculating, you will tell me I am lying.  He and only he knows from where he spoke to Nzirorera.  The fact is he told me about their telephone conversation.  If the conversation took place in the morning or in the afternoon, that does not concern me.  The fact is -- is that he spoke to me and told me about the telephone conversation. 
Q.	Well, Witness BTH, I put it to you that there never was a telephone conversation with Mr. Nzirorera and that Michel Niyigaba never told you of such a conversation, but this is simply something that you have fabricated to accuse Mr. Nzirorera of ordering these killings.  
A.	Who was there between me and you?  And who did Michel Niyigaba speak to, me or you?  I am recounting what he told me.  I cannot make anything up to lump charges on Mr. Nzirorera.  What good would it be to me that he be thrown in jail?  Basically, I am here to tell the truth.  I would also like to tell you that Nzirorera was a very important and influential figure.  Do you think that the young Interahamwes decided to take money, purchase weapons, buy uniforms for the Interahamwe without the participation of the government authorities?  Do you think that these youths took the initiatives to purchase the weapons and uniforms?  He was an MP, and he was supposed to protect members of the population.  What did he do to protect the members of the population he represented in parliament?  So I am telling you of the events -- of events that I am certain of and I am not making anything up.  Besides, if you ask him, he will confirm he knows me very well. 
Q.	Well, Witness BTH, I'm not going to react to your long statement or else we are going to be here for too long.  But I will tell you that both Mr. Nzirorera and Michel Niyigaba have told me that there was never such a telephone call.  So we can only conclude from that that this is a fabrication on your part.  Do you have any comment on that before we move on? 
A.	No. 
Q.	When you went --  
A.	No.  These are not fabrications; this is exactly what Niyigaba told me, and it is not the first time I tell you this.  Bring me Michel Niyigaba and I will say before him that he told me about this. 
Q.	After the killings that occurred in Mumabanga area, you went to Busogo parish, correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And you participated in the killing of Tutsi there, correct? 
A.	Yes, Tutsis were killed in that locality.  Those are the ones we killed -- or they are the ones we killed. 
Q.	And can you tell us approximately the number of victims at each of those three locations, the area where you first attacked, Rwankeli and Busogo secteur, secondly, Mumabanga, and third, Busogo parish? 
A.	I did not count.  There were very many of them.  But if I were to give a reckoning, I know that there are a lot of them, more than 300 people killed. 
Q.	Now, did you go to ESTB school on the 7th of April? 
A.	Yes, we went to the school in the afternoon. 
Q.	And this -- this was a school that you were a student at, correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And at this time on the 7th of April, there were -- it was the Easter recess, correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Now, the school itself was administered by the Josephite brothers, correct? 
A.	At a certain point, the Josephite brothers left.  Initially, the school was managed by the Josephite brothers, then by one Bohi Marc, and thirdly, by one Élie Naragerageje. 
Q.	And were there any Tutsis among the persons whose were administrators or teachers at the school? 
A.	I know one Barnabé who was a teacher, and amongst the Josephite brothers there were also some Tutsis.  But as I said, at a certain point they left. 
Q.	And were there Tutsi students at the ESTB school? 
A.	Yes, there were some, but gradually they left the school. 
Q.	Were there any*********************************************************************************************? 
A.	Yes, there were a few. 
Q.	And can you give us their names, please? 
A.	Yes, one Kodo, son of Birimaso, Laurent Nsengiyumva, Habyaremye.  I don't remember the names of the other Interahamwe, Amahindure.  If I do remember them, I will tell you. 
Q.	Okay, thank you.  Now, the person who later became the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune, Emmanuel Harerimana, was also a professor at the ESTB school, correct? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	And you already told us that he was a member of the MDR party, correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And it was Mr. Nzirorera who was in charge of this school overall, correct? 
A.	Yes, it was his school.  He was the top official at that school. 
Q.	Now, there came a time during your career at that school when you got into some trouble, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And can you tell us what that trouble was? 
A.	At a certain point the students went on strike, the students who were in the public works and construction department.  They left the school and headed down -- up to the bureau de secteur vicinity.  At that time -- at that point the authorities arrived and checked all of the students to find out who was absent.  It was concluded that all students who were not at the school had left to join the students in the public works and construction department who had gone on strike.  And since on that day I happened to be absent, they concluded that I had joined the striking students, and I was expelled from school as a result. 
Q.	And so it is your testimony that the reason you were expelled from the school was that you were mistakenly accused of participating in a strike? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Well, Witness BTH, I suggest to you that you were -- the real reason you were expelled from that school was that*******************************************************************************************, isn't that the truth? 
A.	No, no, that is not true.  The person who gave you that information was lying.  I have just given you the true position. 
Q.	Now, after you were expelled from the school, isn't it true that your parents went to Mr. Nzirorera to ask him to help you be reinstated as a student? 
A.	Maybe Nzirorera told you that, but he lied to you.  He never spoke to my parents about me.  It is I and another expelled boy named ********(phonetic) who personally went to see Nzirorera.  So he should not say or should not try to mislead you.  *****(phonetic) and I went to see him personally, and I know that he himself, Nzirorera, took us to the school at the time he had presided over a meeting and I know that he sacked the director of the school; his name was Bohi Marc, a white man.  He sacked him, and after sacking him, he ordered that we be taken back to -- in the school, and that our averages should be put up so that we could go to the next level or class.  So it is he who brought us back and who sacked the director or principal of the school, which means he must have noticed that we had been unjustly expelled, given that he fired the principal. 
Q.	And it is your testimony then that you were able to return to that school as a result of the intervention of Mr. Nzirorera; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I said it and I say it again, Nzirorera himself ordered that we be reinstated as students.  And I recall that on the day that we were reinstated, that is when he distributed to us Interahamwe uniforms.  He went to his house together with a number of people who were with him.  And I remember that that is the very day he distributed the Interahamwe uniforms to us. 
Q.	Well, Witness, you testified that you left the school from April to June 1992, and then you testified also that you recalled specifically that the uniforms were distributed in August of 1992.  So --  
A.	Yes, you are right, Counsel.  I will explain it once again.  What you have just said is correct.  When I was in third year I did not complete the whole of the third term.  In the month of July -- months of July, August and September, that is the period that coincides with the long holidays, so that the principal was not absent when we resumed after the long holidays.  So Nzirorera distributed these uniforms to us once he had reinstated us as students. 
Q.	And your testimony is that this meeting that you had with Mr. Nzirorera about being reinstated and the meeting where he sacked the principal all took place in August of 1992; is that right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, you have told us that you had military training in 1992 at Isimbi.  Can you tell us what months of 1992 did that take place, was it before or after August? 
A.	It was after August. 
Q.	So you once again absented yourself from school to undergo military training; is that correct? 
A.	Let me clarify.  The school year began in mid-September.  I know that when I underwent the training, school had not yet resumed.  School started after the 20th of September. 
Q.	So then the training took place very shortly after you received the uniforms; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you underwent training again in 1993, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you once again absented yourself from school to undergo this training? 
A.	Yes, but it was for a short time. 
Q.	Now, returning to your activities on the 7th of April, you told us that you went to a location in Nkuli commune to kill Tutsis on that evening but that nobody was killed because it was too dark; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And did you go on the 7th to a place also known as Rwankeri, but this was an Adventist community in Nkuli commune? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did you see any Tutsi killed there on the 7th of April? 
A.	Yes, some Tutsis were killed. 
Q.	Do you know about how many Tutsis were killed there? 
A.	Personally, I saw Tutsis being killed, but prior to this, other Tutsis had been killed.  So I personally witnessed the killing of a young man called**********, as well as his sister.  I know *********was burnt using petrol that was inside his family's home. 
Q.	Can you give us a number -- an estimate as to the number of victims at the Adventist church area in Nkuli commune? 
A.	I do not know their number because I wasn't there when those people were killed.  All I said is that I personally witnessed the killing of two people in the afternoon.  As for the others, I was not present. 
Q.	The next morning when you went killing in Musamba, can you tell us approximately how many people were killed at that location, also in Nkuli commune?
A.	No, I did not count them, but it was a large number.  I merely witnessed the killing of two people, an old woman and her child. 
Q.	Did you see either Mr. Nzirorera, Colonel Augustin Bizimungu, Casimir Bizimungu, or                  Colonel Ephrem Setako on the 8th of April? 
A.	No, I did not see them. 
Q.	Now, turning your attention to the 14th of April when the people came from Ruhengeri town and ultimately went to kill at the court of appeal, it was you to whom Mr. Kajelijeli turned to round up Interahamwe from Mukingo to accompany them, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So, *************************************************continued as of the 14th of April, correct? 
A.	Yes, I must point out to you that this continued through July when we fled. 
Q.	And the initiative for the killing of the people at the court of appeal came from Ruhengeri, correct? 
A.	I don't know who took the initiative.  They just told me -- I saw that vehicles were made available to us, but I don't know whose idea it was. 
Q.	And it was members of the CDR party who came from Ruhengeri to get reinforcements to go kill the Tutsis, correct? 
A.	In fact, this is what happened.  Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi from Ruhengeri arrived.  We saw them, we saw two vehicles passing.  And they got to the Petrorwanda petrol station and then Kajelijeli told me to go fetch strong young men to go and lend a hand to the Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi from Ruhengeri in killing the people who were at the court of appeal.  So I do not know how those two people got in touch to come and get us.  Kajelijeli just came to tell me that I should get people for him, which I did. 
Q.	And at the time he told you to do that the people from Ruhengeri were already in Mukingo commune, correct? 
A.	But, Counsel, I don't quite get your question. 
Q.	What I am asking you is that when you were instructed to get Interahamwe from Mukingo commune, the people from Ruhengeri, the Interahamwe and the Impuzamugambi, were already present in Mukingo at that time, correct? 
A.	Yes, they were already at the Petrorwanda station in the Byangabo centre. 
Q.	And do you have any information at all of any involvement of Mr. Nzirorera in the attack on the court of appeal? 
A.	All I know is this, Kajelijeli and Baheza were following orders from Nzirorera, they would consult each other whenever something was needed to be done, but I did not see Nzirorera. 
Q.	And did anyone mention Nzirorera's name --  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry, I didn't get the first portion of that last response.  Could I have that repeated please?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Can you look on your live notes and read it?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I don't have live notes, but I have a gap in the interpretation and I want the sentence to make complete sense, that is what I am trying to get at. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, can you repeat your answer? 
A.	I told you that Nzirorera was not present, I did not see him there.  But I just know that Kajelijeli and Baheza would first of all consult Nzirorera before they did anything. 
Q.	Did either Kajelijeli or Baheza mention Nzirorera's name when you were discussing the attack on the court of appeal? 
A.	I don't remember anymore.  I just know that he told me to go and fetch people, and they boarded a vehicle and headed towards Ruhengeri. 
Q.	Now, when was the first time that you saw Joseph Nzirorera in Mukingo commune after the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	The very first time I saw him there was when Basile was sworn in in Mukingo commune. 
Q.	And you have placed that event two weeks after the 7th of April, correct? 
A.	Yes, one would estimate it at about that time. 
Q.	And you have told us that that event took place at the Gisesero football pitch, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And Gisesero is No. 26 on the spelling list.

I'm going to ask that the registrar provides you with an exhibit and --  which I have made a list of the people that you previously said attended this ceremony.  It is going to take me one moment to get the exhibit number. 
MR. ROBINSON:
This will be number 22, if the witness could be provided with number 22 in my packet of exhibits. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, directing your attention to that document, is that an accurate list of the authorities who you claim attended the swearing in of the new préfet? 
A.	Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would offer this exhibit as D. NZ154. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ154 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And you, yourself, personally attended this ceremony, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And did you see the préfet take the oath of office? 
A.	I said that the new préfet was introduced to us.  I never said that he took the oath of office. 
Q.	So was it your understanding that he had already been sworn in at some other ceremony? 
A.	I believe that he had already been sworn into office because he was simply being introduced to us and at that time he was already préfet, which means that he had already taken the oath of office. 
Q.	And you have told us also that at this gathering in Mukingo commune the entire population was invited, it was an open meeting, correct? 
A.	Yes, members of the population were invited. 
Q.	And you have told us that there were more than 3,000 persons who attended this, correct? 
A.	Yes, but it was only an approximation. 
Q.	Okay, that is understood.  And you have told us that the first to speak was Semahane, who was the acting bourgmestre of Mukingo commune; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then after him the minister of interior took the floor; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, as far as I can recall. 
Q.	And was that the minister himself or a representative of the ministry of interior? 
A.	I no longer remember.  All that comes to mind is that the senior official of that minister was present.  And I do not know whether it was the minister himself or his representative. 
Q.	Now after that person spoke, you have told us that Jerome Bicamumpaka also spoke, correct? 
A.	Yes, he spoke. 
Q.	And what was your understanding of his position at the time? 
A.	He was the minister of the MDR Power party, but I do not know which ministry he headed. 
Q.	Witness, I'm looking at you and you are looking rather poorly -- are you okay? 
A.	Yes, indeed, I have a problem, I do not feel okay.
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I don't know if you would like to take a break now or take some other action, but I will leave it to you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, well, we can -- it is almost 10:30 and we can take the mid-morning recess now, and we will see what happens.  
(Court recessed from 1025H to 1102H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson, you may continue. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, are you able to continue? 
A.	I will try. 
Q.	Okay.  So, I put it to you, Witness BTH, that at the time of this meeting that you claim took place at Gisesero for the introduction of the new préfet, that Jerome Bicamumpaka was the minister of foreign affairs; is that correct or do you know?  
A.	All I know is that he held a ministerial portfolio.  As to the ministry he was in charge of, that I do not know. 
Q.	And you told us that Casimir Bizimungu also spoke at this introduction ceremony; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And what was his position in the government at that time? 
A.	He was also minister. 
Q.	And then the new préfet, Préfet Basile Nsabumugisha, also spoke, correct?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And that is number 65 on the spelling list.  And also Mr. Nzirorera spoke; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, Witness BTH, I put it to you that this meeting, that you have testified about, never, in fact, took place.  And that we have contacted Basile, Mr. Nzirorera, General Bizimungu, Mr. Bicamumpaka, Kajelijeli, Nyabusore and Casimir Bizimungu, and none of them know anything about such a meeting; do you have any comment on that?  
A.	Yes, I have a comment to make on that matter.  Most of those people are detained.  I know Basile very well because******************************.  Basile is an extremist.  There is nothing he can tell you.  All I know is that what he says is not true.  He was, indeed, present and the meeting did take place.  

All of these people stand accused, so they cannot incriminate each other.  All of these people are accused of killing people.  If you ask them questions to establish whether the meeting took place, none of them will admit that they took part in the meeting.  However, there are other Rwandans who can testify that the meeting was held.  And Basile was, indeed, introduced on that occasion.  And all of those public figures did take the floor on that occasion. 
Q.	And I suggest to you, Witness BTH, that minister Bicamumpaka was, at the very time you claim he was in Gisesero, in New York addressing the United Nations Security Council.  And that Casimir Bizimungu was also outside of Rwanda during this time which is documented.  Do you have any comment on that? 
A.	I just know that I saw them at the said meeting, and I knew them very well.  Even if you were to show them to me today, I could recognise them.  So now when you say that one of these figures was in    New York and the other was elsewhere, I would not agree with you.  Maybe they fabricated the missions they are referring to.  

When we arrived in exile they still kept issuing passports, distributing passports.  I am, therefore, certain that I saw them at the said meeting.  And if they were to be shown to me, I would be able to tell you that this is Bizimungu or someone else.  Is Kajelijeli denying these facts?  But he has been tried and convicted, so he cannot deny.  The same charges were brought against him just as they are being brought against Nzirorera and the others.  Kajelijeli, therefore, cannot deny these facts.  

As for Augustin Bizimungu, I think he cannot defend himself.  It is very difficult for him to defend himself.  He is a military leader, and Tutsi were killed.  How can he account for the killing of the Tutsi during his tenure as a military officer?  What is his defence?  Unless he says that Tutsis were not killed throughout the country. 
Q.	Witness BTH, I'm now going to ask you about the rapes that took place in Mukingo commune.  You told us of the rape of two women on the 7th of April, and the rape of women in June of 1994 from an ONATRACOM bus; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.  But I must say that in regard -- with regard to the women who were killed on the        7th of April 1994, one of them was tortured before she was killed, whereas the other one was raped. 
Q.	Did you ever hear anyone give orders to the Interahamwe to commit rape? 
A.	They were told to kill the Tutsi.  As to the way they killed the Tutsi, that was not specified.  The Interahamwe were never told, "Kill these people using bullets; kill these other people using other weapons."  And I never heard Nzirorera specify that the women should be raped before they were killed.  I believe I said this in court.  But I said that when it was said that the women were raped, and it was said in the presence of the authorities, and as people boasted about their exploits, the authorities did not raise a finger.  Besides, I know -- I'm certain that he knows that his son Noel -- rather, his nephew Noel is accused of -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And he knows why his nephew Noel was killed, corrects the Kinyarwanda booth. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	His nephew Noel was punished for the rape by being shot by an army officer, correct? 
A.	Yes, he fired at him because he had refused to hand over to him the girl that he had kept in his house. 
Q.	Did Mr. Nzirorera attend the burial of Noel? 
A.	No, I didn't see him there. 
Q.	And did Nzirorera ever have the officer punished who had shot and killed his nephew? 
A.	I know nothing about that. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I would like to offer two exhibits, which are just hard copies of the transcripts that I referred to this morning during my cross-examination; I had an opportunity to print those out.  One of them is D. NZ155, which is the transcript of the 8th of April 2004, page 50. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have both languages this time or -- 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Not yet, I'm going to bring the French next week. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
 (Exhibit No. D. NZ155 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
And as D. NZ156, the transcript of the 14th of April 2004, page 46. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ156 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
And, Mr. President, I have no further questions of this witness at this time but I would reserve my right to recall him for further cross-examination once remaining materials from the government of Rwanda are received.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Robinson.

Witness, what is your condition now?  We would normally go on until 12:30, but I was just wondering what your condition was now.  Can you proceed to 12:30?  
THE WITNESS:
I had said I would try, and I thought that the Counsel's questions would be very lengthy, but since he has just completed his questions, I would like to ask for permission to go and rest, if that is possible. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Just as a matter of interest, who would be cross-examining next?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I am available and in the hands of the Court, as well as the witness, for my cross-examination on behalf of Mr. Ngirumpatse. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have any idea of how long you would be?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I think it would take about a day. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible), Mr. Sow, what is your position?  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I think that I would take about three hours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

In those circumstances, Mr. Witness, we will grant your request, and we will take the adjournment now.  You can return on Monday morning.  I remind you that you don't discuss the case or your testimony with anybody during this or any other adjournment.  So, the witness is excused.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.
(Witness exits the courtroom)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I wanted to let you know as a matter of scheduling that we will not be sitting next week on Wednesday and Friday, and that we will recommence on the following Monday at 11 -- sorry, sorry.  That was a slip of the tongue.  On next week, Thursday and Friday we will not be sitting.  And on the Monday, the 26th, we will recommence at 11, 11 o'clock in the morning.

Now, Mr. Webster, is there any other information regarding the Serugendo issue?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I actually didn't hear the last words from Your Honour.  I believe you said Serugendo or -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, is there any other information concerning that matter?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Nothing that would generate any productive discussion at this point.  We are working on it.  I believe we do have an English translation of the statement.  It should be in the hands of the Defence.  If it is not, it should get to them sometime today, or very shortly.  But in terms of the applications that are going to be made, nothing has been finalised yet. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if I can just speak on that issue?  I think we are very concerned that this testimony be -- take place and that there not be any undue delays that would result in the testimony not being available.  And there is still some question as to what is the best way to take this testimony, whether it is by deposition or whether either the Prosecution or the Defence should make an application to the Trial Chamber to take the witness out of order and hear his testimony, live, in front of this                 Trial Chamber.  But I don't think we can wait very much longer to have the Prosecutor discussing among himself and delaying, so I would ask that you ask -- that you order Mr. Webster to let you know on Monday what the position of the Prosecution is so that we can move forward from there without -- I don't want to lose this testimony.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
You know, the Court in the past has encouraged informal meetings.  There is nothing I would like to discuss on the record with respect to Serugendo, but, if, you know, the Court thinks that it is appropriate, this session could be adjourned and we could remain in the courtroom and we could have an informal discussion and I could share with the Court my thoughts on the matter.  But there is nothing I want to state on the record at this time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we could take the adjournment now, because we don't have any other formal business for today.  So, we are -- adjourn the session and it will be resumed to Monday morning.
(Court adjourned at 1122H)
