Cross-examination by Mr. Webster (continued)	7






























P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Jøensen, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, the 25th of May 2009, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  The appearances are the same.  

Good morning, Mr. Karemera.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President, my respects.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your testimony continues this morning.  
THE WITNESS:
I am ready, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we will commence now.

I'm sorry.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  

We have a concern at the level of the Defence.  We have just been disclosed new documents, Mr. President, if you could kindly take a look at the documents that were disclosed by the Prosecution.  I would say 100 documents were served that the Prosecutor intends to use in his cross-examination and that we have just received.  

Before counsel for the Prosecution can go forward, I have an application I wish to make to the Trial Chamber for this issue to be solved immediately, and my application is quite simple, Mr. President.  The Defence cannot receive during the cross-examination, at a time when counsel for the Prosecution has finished with at least one-third of his cross-examination, to receive an additional binder, especially since I know that a number of rulings have been made by you, Mr. President, on this issue.  

Let me simply remind all of us of the ruling you made on Thursday when we left.  Mr. Webster started this morning by disclosing two documents to us.  He warned us yesterday through email that additional documents would be disclosed to us, which he has just done this Monday morning, Mr. President.  And I request, in accordance with the rule of fairness, that you rule that such documents not be used.  

I must admit, quite frankly, that I do not know what those documents are about, but I cannot, at the time when my client is testifying and that documents have been provided to me within the framework of this cross-examination on which I'm working, leave all that aside and now concentrate on an additional bundle of documents.

Mr. President, this is a manoeuvre.  This is an obvious manoeuvre in order to destabilise us.  This is how counsel for the Prosecution works.  This is how he adopts principles of fairness vis-à-vis his colleagues.  That is his view of things.  That is his right entirely.  But that is not my vision of things, Mr. President.  I have a very important and serious responsibility vis-à-vis my client.  I cannot accept such a manoeuvre.  

You are the presiding Judge.  You are the one who is to judge the level of fairness or equity in this trial, and it is for this simple reason that I'm asking that you rule that such documents not be used in the cross-examination of Mr. Karemera.  I thank you.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I merely wish to say that as far as we are concerned, we would find it normal for you to grant sufficient time to us to peruse such documents to see whether we will not have to make use of them in any other way.  I believe this is an issue of fairness in the procedure.  I believe time should be granted to us, the necessary time for us to be able to at least read the documents before we can start any discussion on them.  I am much obliged, Mr. President.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I will simply recall what the Trial Chamber had said yesterday because, in the final analysis, it is not only the observance of the interparties' principles but it is also a matter of knowing whether the Trial Chamber will have its decisions complied with or not.  On Thursday we had the very same discussion and you told Mr. Webster that the last document would be accepted but that he should not do it again, and on Monday morning we are starting all over again.  And this is a challenge that is posed to the Trial Chamber because this is tantamount to telling the Trial Chamber, "You have told me not to continue but I will continue all the same."  

So, Mr. President, what I am merely asking you is that your decisions be complied with and that you tell Mr. Webster that you do not accept that he should continue using such procedures when it was clearly ruled that it should not be so.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Good morning to the Chamber and the parties and the registry.  

Your Honour, I anticipated this application from the Defence this morning.  It's unfortunate.  It would have been preferable for the Prosecution to have copied all of the documents and made them available before we began.  But as a practical reality, that was not possible.  I had previously asked the Court for time to address this very issue because the hurdle that we were trying to confront on Thursday was the logistical challenge of making documents available.  

I had started out with four binders of documents and I had organised the cross-examination in two parts.  And I've been able to reorganise the documents and reduce it to two binders, but the cross-examination is still in two parts.  And I had anticipated taking two days to do it, that was my objective, but whether I will achieve that is another issue.  

But on the general issue of circulating these documents, I wish to reiterate that this is not a disclosure issue.  This has nothing to do with Rule 66, 67 or 68.  It's nothing that is discussed in the jurisprudence of our Tribunal.  This is a matter of trial administration, which clearly is within the Court's discretion, and I am certainly not attempting to flout this Court's order, but the Defence discuss this issue as if it's an issue of disclosure, when plainly it is not.  

Now, during the course of the Defence presentation of their case, there have been many times when they have not given us documents in bulk at the beginning of a witness's testimony.  There have been many times when we have received documents right before they were going to be used midway through a witness's examination.  And there have been times when documents have been admitted into evidence without us even seeing the document before the attempt to tender it was made.  The most recent example of that was just last week when Dior Diagne admitted into evidence a document from André Guichaoua that I hadn't seen.  And at that time I had requested as a matter of courtesy to just allow me to look at the document before the Court entered it into evidence, and that upset the Defence.  For what reason, I don't know.  

Even with respect to the examination of this witness, Mr. Sow started his examination on Monday with one set of documents.  We received incrementally documents while the witness was on the stand.  On Wednesday, Madam Dior Diagne started her examination with another set of documents.  She asked her first question, when I received her documents only two minutes before that.  So what the Defence is suggesting is really that the Court apply a double standard, because all throughout the trial we have received documents piecemeal and I have never taken the time to raise it as an issue because I understand that there are logistical hurdles involved and challenges in presenting documents for a case of this size and complexity.  

Now, as a practical matter, all of the documents -- of all of the documents that are provided in two binders, 90 per cent of them have already been admitted in evidence and a significant number of those are actually Defence exhibits.  So what I have done is simply facilitated our ability to access these documents because they are printed out and they're organised in binders, but these are all documents that the Defence have seen before and they have even tendered a good part of them in evidence.  

Now, I did take the precaution of contacting the Defence on Saturday.  My first email to the Defence, which was copied to the Trial Chamber coordinator, was sent out on Saturday afternoon.  And at that time I indicated my cell phone number and my personal email, and I invited them to contact me and offered to drop binders off to them at their convenience, and I heard from no one on Saturday.

And then on Sunday morning, having not heard from the Defence, I circulated the index for the documents so that, even if they did not have the physical binders, they'd have a list of everything that was included in the binders and, once again, 90 per cent of which are documents that had been admitted into evidence in this trial, and even with respect to those, some of them are documents that the Defence used last week with this very same witness.  

So I can understand their concern, but I would suggest to the Court that it's specious, that it's just a manoeuvre to bring some drama to the proceedings when it's unwarranted.  

Now, I would have preferred to have everything organised well in advance of Mr. Karemera's direct evidence.  That wasn't possible, and I indicated that to the Court.  But at this stage it would be most unfair if the Court were to entertain an application to limit my use of the documents when they are being circulated simply to facilitate matters for everyone.  These are all documents that the Defence have seen before.  And to the extent that there is an issue, it's an issue that should be addressed when they commence their redirect.  

Now, the documents in the second binder I don't anticipate using until tomorrow morning, so they clearly have today and overnight, which is more than we usually have when we deal with documents in cross-examination.  Usually we go directly from the direct exam into the cross and we hardly have time to open the bundle before we start using them with the Defence witnesses.  

So I think that completes my response to the Defence.  But I would -- on my list of examples I have one more, which probably should register immediately in the Court's mind, which is when a recent witness from two weeks ago offered into evidence a video, which we had never seen, which clearly was available for several years to the Defence.  We saw that for the first time in Court with the rest of the Chamber.  

So I'm not suggesting that this is the best way to proceed.  Clearly, we would have preferred to be much more organised at the beginning.  But this is simply a logistical hurdle and it does not give the Prosecution a strategic advantage.  And I would think having these binders in court would make things much easier for the Defence because, as a practical matter, all of these documents can be accessed on their laptops, which I assume has a direct link to the repository of admitted exhibits in our case.  

That's my response, Your Honour, and with my apologies I'd like to continue. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we have listened to the objection and to the response.  We think that there's a limit, which Mr. Nimy put his finger on the issue, in that the real issue in regard to fairness has to do with the question of time for perusal and conducting the redirect examination.  And I think that we will address that in due course.  

Mr. Webster, we think that the issue is an important one to do with fairness of the process, and even though we understand that there are logistical problems which can sometimes create inefficiencies in the way things go, we expect that that would not be the way it's normally done.  We feel that the -- it's normal that the cross-examination is conducted as soon as the evidence in-chief is completed.  It's most unusual for us to think that anybody would want a delay between examination-in-chief and cross-examination, which means that the preparation for cross-examination should take place well in advance of the examination-in-chief.  So we don't accept that it is a normal thing for this type of delay to allow special preparation for cross-examination.  

Anyway, we will grant permission to continue, and we will consider in due course whether any additional remedies are needed in terms of time for redirect.  So you may continue.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I wish to be given some clarifications regarding your ruling because when it will be time for you to determine, the harm will have been done already.  The documents are here.  They are before us.  And we wish to know whether your ruling is that for the time being and pending your ruling Mr. Webster is not authorised to use the documents that have been disclosed to us and that he can continue with documents that had been disclosed to us in due course, because it might be the translation but what I heard is that, indeed, the Defence should be given time to peruse the documents that were disclosed to it.  So the binder and the two documents that were distributed this morning, are they to be set aside while waiting for a ruling of the Trial Chamber on the possibility for counsel for the Prosecution to use such documents or not?  

The Defence requires clarification -- needs clarifications, because if counsel for the Prosecution can use documents that the Defence has not been able to read, if such is your ruling, I believe this should be known at the beginning of the cross-examination by counsel for the Prosecution for us to adopt an appropriate position.  I thank you for this clarification, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  What I had said was that I had referred to Mr. Nimy's contribution because the usual remedy for the complaint that had been raised would be to provide time for counsel before conducting redirect examination, and that was what Mr. Nimy had suggested.  So I had -- so we will -- so I made that reference in that context.  So we have decided to allow Mr. Webster to use the document, and we will consider whether it is necessary to grant time for redirect when the situation -- when the time for redirect comes.  So that was the ruling that we made, that he is permitted to use the documents.  He is permitted to use the documents in his cross-examination.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, under such circumstances the Defence has an application to make.  Mr. President, we wish for the proceedings to be adjourned for 15 minutes.  The Defence needs to consult with its -- with the members of the team in order to adopt a common position.  When the documents were disclosed to us this morning we were convinced that the documents would not have been used in any way whatsoever.  

Mr. President, I have to admit that it is my professional integrity that is in question here but, of course, you will tell me that this is not important in relation to the proceedings and the trial itself.  Mr. President, I'm not in any position to be able to continue following your ruling, which I accept and which I have understood quite clearly, but since it has serious consequences on my client's case, I believe the Defence is unanimous in requesting that we be able to consult for 15 minutes or during a period that you will determine.  But we need to discuss this new situation we are faced with because, Mr. President, I must say, quite frankly, that this would pose an ethical problem for us and we need to adopt a position.  

So we respectfully submit that a few minutes be granted to us for us to be able to consult with one another because we have before us documents we have never seen.  And, Mr. President, I believe we all need to take our responsibilities.  Even if Mr. Karemera is to continue defending himself alone, why not?  But I would simply request, Mr. President, that a few minutes be granted to us for us to be able to consult with one another.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I fully endorse the request made by Counsel Diagne.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the application is not granted.  I had indicated that we would consider granting time at the end of the cross-examination of this witness.  But in the meantime the cross-examination should continue.  
MR. WEBSTER:
May I proceed?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I just ruled.
ÉDOUARD KAREMERA,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.  Good morning, Mr. Karemera.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
Q.	Mr. Karemera, we left off on Thursday with Gaspard Ruhumuriza, and I just want to finish up one or two points with him and move on to something else.  

Now, this is the former minister of tourism in the interim government, who you characterised as hesitant and fearful to join the interim government when it was being set up and cowardly and traitorous for having abandoned it in June 1994 when he fled the country and resigned; is that correct? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, thank you for your question.  I do not know whether these are the words you are putting in my mouth or whether it is the interpreter who has used such words, but I never said that Mr. Ruhumuriza was a coward.  Never.  I said that he left for Switzerland with funding by the government because he was sent on a mission by President Sindikubwabo in order to defend the cause of the republic and, in fact, he was trying to find the place where he was going to settle.  I said that he found the former archbishop of Kigali, Monseigneur Perraudin -- P-E-R-A-U-D-I-N (sic) because I saw that the court -- court reporters had written the name incorrectly.  

	He, Ruhumuriza, had gone to the minor seminary in Kabgayi.  And once he was sure that he would have such a place where to retire, he went back to Rwanda.  I do not know whether he made a report or not but, as I said, the reports are sent to whoever has sent a person for a mission.  So I cannot engage his responsibility or say anything on what he did.  But what I do know is that shortly afterwards he left with his wife and his two children, after having sold the vehicles that had been put at his disposal, probably because he needed money.  Ruhumuriza was not a rich man.  And since he was leaving, he was going into exile, I can understand that he would have needed some money.  But selling the government vehicles is perhaps going a bit too far.  And what I meant was that he had been dishonest throughout this operation.  But I did not say that he was a coward at all.  So you should take responsibility for the use of this word vis-à-vis your witness. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you for your response.  And once again it was very elaborate.  I'm going to ask you that today, Mr. Karemera, we have to be very direct with our answers.  So if the answer can be answered in one or two sentences, I'd prefer that you do that.  I'm not trying to deprive you of an opportunity to give your evidence, but just go to the heart of the question and answer it, please.  

Now, as for the characterisation of -- your characterisation of Mr. Ruhumuriza, the record will reflect your response from last week.  But would you agree with me or is it consistent with your information that he was absent from Rwanda for at least a month sometime between the period of the 15th of April and the 15th of May?  Is that consistent with your information?  Just answer yes or no, please.  
A.	No, I no longer recall what I said, but I don't think that he stayed away one month.  That would be too long.  I believe that would be too long.  But I think he stayed out a fortnight, but really that's just an approximation.  I can't be certain. 
Q.	Okay.  The information that I have is that he left definitively around the 12th of June.  Is that consistent with your information? 
A.	Yes, around then, indeed. 
Q.	But nonetheless, during the period that he was in the country he participated in a few cabinet meetings that would have included you; is that correct? 
A.	You know, cabinet meetings were held once a week.  I joined government on 25 May.  And since you state that he left around 12 June, it's likely that we attended two or three -- that two or three meetings during that period were held.  So I cannot -- I cannot deny the fact that he attended a meeting that I attended.  I do not recall but I think that is possible.  I think maybe one or two during that period is likely.  The meeting of the 10th of June was held.  I wonder if he attended that meeting.  But it is likely that there was a meeting at the time that we were leaving Murambi with the arrival of the RPF.  It is likely that he attended that meeting and that I was there as well. 
Q.	Thank you, once again, for that very elaborate response.  And is it your -- the information -- is it consistent with your information that since June of 1994 he has remained in Europe where he has some sort of refugee status or political asylum?  Is that information or that statement consistent with information that you have?  Yes or no.  
A.	I don't have any information on Ruhumuriza's situation.  I don't have that information.  I know that he was in Switzerland.  I can't tell you if he is still there. 
Q.	Thank you.  And Gaspard Ruhumuriza was the only member of the Abatabazi government that was assembled on the 8th of April 1994 that resigned his ministry before the military defeat on the 14th of July 1994; isn't that correct?  
A.	What do you mean?
Q.	I will repeat -- 
A.	He resigned where?
Q.	I will simply repeat the question.  Is it consistent with your information that Gaspard Ruhumuriza was the only interim government minister that resigned from the government prior to its being defeated by the RPF in July of 1994?  Yes or no.  If it's not consistent with your information, we will go on to something else.
A.	Prosecutor, we need to understand each other. 
Q.	We do have to understand each other, and what I'm asking you to do is to answer the question directly.  If it's consistent with your information, say yes.  If it's not, say no.  That's all I want to hear at this point.  
A.	But Prosecutor, you are -- you are making a wrong suggestion to me.  I can't answer by yes or no.  I can tell you what it means to resign.  What does it mean to resign?
Q.	If it is not consistent with your information, simply say no and wait for the next question.  I will elaborate.  But we have to set some ground rules today because we have a lot of ground to cover.  Listen to the question, answer the question, and then we'll move on.
A. 	Yes, I listened to the question. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't think that for a witness of this type that a yes or no answer is always an appropriate response.
THE WITNESS:
I mean, this is unbelievable.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, the floor is yours.  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, resigning -- Ruhumuriza resigning, you are the one who told me about that.  He had the right of writing to President Sindikubwabo.  I am not President Sindikubwabo.  How would you want me to have information?  Allow me to confirm whether Ruhumuriza resigned?  What can I tell you?  That Ruhumuriza, indeed, as from the date which you put to me, which corresponds more or less to the information that I have -- is that as from 10 June or after that he was no longer seen among the cabinet ministers.  And he is not the only one.  And he's not the only one.  If that is -- if that is what you want me to say -- Rwamakuba, André, he left.  He left for disfavour.  Indeed.  He went even before, a little before, Ruhumuriza.  So when you are asking me if he resigned, I cannot tell if he resigned.  If you are asking me if, yes or no, Rwamakuba resigned, I cannot confirm it because he did not have to send a resignation letter to me and the president did not publish any such decision.  

So, to be candid, I would like you to understand me.  I would like to assist you, provide an answer by yes or no if it is reasonable to do so, but I am not going to formulate answers which do not mean anything at all.  That is very unlike me, and I believe that you understand me, now that you have the answer to your question.  

If you had asked me the question, namely, "Did you see Ruhumuriza or did you no longer see him after the 10th?  Is that the only minister that you didn't see?"  I would have answered you directly, "No."  But it is different from stating that, "Did Ruhumuriza resign," I believe.  That is understandable.  
Q.	All right, Mr. Karemera.  Thank you for your clarification.  It was very helpful.  

Let's focus on Kibuye for a bit.  Can you tell us when is the first time that you went to Kibuye after the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	Pardon me?
Q.	My question to you is when was the first time that you went to Kibuye after the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	To Kibuye, you mean at the préfecture or in Kibuye?  Because, you know, I am a native of Kibuye.  If you are telling me about when I went to Kibuye, I believe it is the 3rd of May -- indeed, I am sure.  I don't believe -- 3rd of May 1994. 
Q.	Well, that didn't need much more clarification from me, did it?  You took five sentences to give me an answer that could have taken two words, the 3rd of May.  So I'm talking about the entire préfecture -- 
A.	No, but you are using two to ask me the same question and you have already asked me, so I answered, so you're the one who is wasting time, not me. 
Q.	To clarify things for you again, I'm talking about the entire préfecture of Kibuye.  Was going to -- 
A.	Oh, I see. 
Q.	-- the préfecture hall on the 3rd of May the first time that you had set foot in Kibuye préfecture after the 6th of April?  
A.	I went on the 2nd.  I spent the night at my home in Nyarusange -- spelling, N-Y-A-R-U-S-A-N-G-E, Nyarusange -- in the Mwendo commune in the Kibuye préfecture.  And that is why I was asking you if it was Kibuye headquarters or the Kibuye sub-préfecture.  So the first time I went there was on 
	the 6th -- after the 6th of April.  It was on the 2nd of May 1994.  I spent the night in my home.  My wife and my children were there.  And the following day I went to the meeting -- rather, I went to -- yes, that's it.  I went to the pacification meeting under Prime Minister Kambanda in Kibuye itself. 
Q.	Where were you coming from when you arrived in Mwendo on the 2nd of May? 
A.	I was coming from Murambi. 
Q.	Did you travel by road? 
A.	There is no plane that lands near Murambi.  Even the road is barely usable.  And, you know, I didn't go on foot, so I would have spent three days to arrive, so if I was going -- if I was trekking it would have been three days. 
Q.	When you left for the meeting at the préfecture on the following day, did you also travel by road? 
A.	Yes, I travelled by road.  I passed through Gasenyi -- if that is the question you are about to ask me, because that's the only road -- I went through Gasenyi, Karongi, and I went through Mushubati, and I arrived, and I passed in front of the Rwanda petrol station.  If you know Kibuye, that's the only petrol filling station before you arrive the former MRND palace where the meeting took place.  That is the trajectory I used in my vehicle. 
Q.	Do you recall what time of day it was when you were travelling by road to the préfecture office on the 3rd of May? 
A.	In the morning. 
Q.	Early in the morning?  Midmorning?  To the extent that you remember, tell us, please.
A.	I remember it was in the morning.  In any case, before the meeting began I was already in Kibuye.  I was there on time. 
Q.	What time did the meeting begin? 
A.	I no longer recall, but I think it was around the end of the morning.  I mean between 10, maybe 11.  I think it is written somewhere in that famous per se verbal.  If you wish, I can take a look and tell you.  You have it as well.  But that is not significant.  I'm sure you would tell us that.  
Q.	Don't need to address that now.  How long did it take to travel from Mwendo to Kibuye town by road? 
A.	Well, it depends.  It depends.  It all depends.  If you have a driver who is not very used to the Kibuye hills, you could spend two and a half hours.  But I had -- I was used to using that road, so I spent an hour and a half. 
Q.	It was daybreak when you left Mwendo to go to Kibuye, was it not, the préfecture office? 
A.	No, I don't live in Mwendo, Mr. Webster.  I live in Nyarusange.  Nyarusange is found far away from Mwendo.  So if you place me in Mwendo, of course, it was going to be two and a half hours.  I went from my home.  And the road that you referred to as -- your witness AMO referred to as Karemera road, goes from Nyarusange.  I am the person who had that road built.  When you call it a road, by lack of words, it's actually a path which I used to quickly go from my home to Kibuye without having to go around.  So when you go from my home through that shortcut, you arrive Kibuye between one and a half hours, one hour 45 minutes.  So don't tell me that I left early in the morning before I came to Kibuye.  That was on the 3rd.  Because, as I told you, the distances can be covered in 
	an hour and a half, two hours on the outside.  It's likely I left around 8 o'clock and I arrived around 10, so the meeting was around 10, maybe 11 o'clock a.m. 
Q.	Thank you, once again, for your very helpful, elaborate response.  Do you recall seeing anybody in Gasenyi centre when you passed through on your way to Kibuye town? 
A.	Somebody by what name?  There are people.  I mean, it's a centre.  If you go through there, there are always people there who are moving about.  At 8 o'clock people were rising.  They are early risers there.  So who would you have loved me to have seen?
Q.	Your response thus far is adequate.  It has answered my enquiry, Mr. Karemera.  We can go on to the next question.  

Did you not see any roadblocks between your home and the préfecture hall in Kibuye on the 3rd of May when you were travelling by road? 
A.	You know, this was in May.  It was in May.  And the roadblocks on that road, there were none.  There were no roadblocks.  But in Gasenyi centre where -- which eyewitness described stating that there was only one roadblock, I will tell you there were three of them, but there was nobody manning them.  At the entrance -- you can even bring out the sketch and I will show it to you.  At the entrance of Gasenyi from my home, there was -- there was some form of roadblock, but there was nobody manning it.  

And my escort had to go out of the vehicle to open it so we could go through in the centre.  Because I know the centre on the main road because the centre of Gasenyi is crossed by the main road, which is known as the Electrogaz road because it had been built by the Electrogaz company.  When the electrification -- the process was being set up, the road comes from Makambazi, 
M-A-K-A-M-B-Z-A (sic).  Makambazi is from -- the main road from Birambo to Kirambo and passing through there.  So when you reach Makambazi you take the road that goes up towards Gisenyi, and that is the road which goes across Gasenyi centre.  At the entrance to that centre there was another roadblock which was not manned, but it was some sort of fence.  It was some form of barrier.  

And at the exit of the centre following the same road going towards Karongi -- and that is an area I know because it's my area -- before going to the house where your neighbour to the right took a photograph and showed it to AMO -- before going there, there was another -- another barrier, let's say a fence, which was not manned because it was May.  There were no problems there any longer.  But looking at, you know, from that perspective, now and then people who wanted to chat would go out there and sit there, and so it was said they were manning the roadblock, but there were no longer any barriers.  

But because these people did not want to be surprised, they were doing rounds because, you know, there are three entrances to that centre.  From my centre -- there was one from when you are coming from my area, what I refer to as a barrier, that is; Makambazi was another; and when you are going out towards Karongi there was another fence.  So there were three fences, if that is what you want me to say.  That's what I saw.  But they were not manned.  And since I had an escort, I was not a person who had to go and open the barriers, so nobody was there to stop us. 
Q.	Once again, thank you very much for your very helpful, elaborate response to my question.  

Did you not see any indicia of the devastation, of the killings of civilians in Kibuye préfecture when you were on the road from your home to the préfecture office that morning on the 3rd of May? 
A.	None.  No indication. 
Q.	So as far as you were concerned, based on your eyewitness observation, security had returned to Kibuye; is that what you are suggesting, Mr. Witness? 
A.	You know, I don't know whether this is an interpretation problem or it is you.  When you are saying security had been restored to Kibuye, what do you mean?  Where?  Because in Bisesero there was no security.  Security had not been restored in Bisesero.  In Bisesero there was complete security (sic).  Now, when you are saying in Kibuye security had been restored, please specify what you mean by that to me. 
Q.	Mr. Karemera, I am actually using your terminology because that's what you have said and others, other government authorities, have said with respect to Kibuye.  At various points security -- the region was insecure, and at other points security had been restored.  Now, I was just checking with you if, by your estimation, on the 3rd of May when you were travelling from your home to the préfecture office, from what you could see, security had been restored.  It's a very simple question, and I believe you have already answered it, so I will move on to the next one.  

When you left the préfecture meeting on the 3rd of May, where did you go? 
A.	I returned to my home in Nyarusange. 
Q.	Again by road? 
A.	Yes, indeed. 
Q.	Did you spend the night there? 
A.	Yes.  That's why I was returning. 
Q.	Did there come a time that you left your home?  When was that, after spending the night on the 
	3rd of May?  
A.	The next day, during the day, I think around mid-morning, I returned to Murambi, and if you want me to tell you the trajectory, I can also state it. 
Q.	I don't want a detailed account.  Did you travel by road through Gikongoro and Butare? 
A.	To go to Murambi?
Q.	That's my question.
A.	No, that is why I was going to talk about the trajectory.  When you leave my home, you arrive Gahunduguru -- G-A-H-U-N-D-U-G-U-R-U, Gahunduguru.  It is another trade centre in Mwendo commune.  You also have a health centre there.  That is like a flag post.  When you reach there, there is a bridge.  I can -- 
Q.	(Microphone not activated)
A.	Well, you know what I'm doing.  The issue -- it's not Gikongoro.  It's a question you asked me.  Now you are interrupting me.  When you cross the bridge -- yes.  
Q.	We will move on to something else.
A.	But you took me to Butare.  Why?  Now let me tell you the trajectory from my place to Murambi.  Because you want me to go to Butare because that is unrealistic.  Let me answer your question entirely.  I mean, this is unbelievable.  
MR. SOW:  
Counsel -- Your Honour, I would like Mr. Webster to allow the witness to express himself when he asks a question.  Now, when he realises he is mistaken, he is asking the witness to stop.  That is inadmissible.  He should allow the witness to express himself for the discussions to be peaceful.  
MR. WEBSTER:
May I continue, Your Honour?  
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Karemera.  
THE WITNESS:
The Prosecutor remembers the trajectory that my spouse took because she testified here, and he is asking me a question to know if when I left my home to go to Murambi I passed through Gikongoro or Butare.  But that is impossible.  My wife came from Butare.  She went through Gikongoro.  But I did not go to Gikongoro to go to Murambi.  I know the geographical geography, or that area.  I left my home.  I arrived Gahunduguru.  When you reach Gahunduguru you turn -- take the road that I also take,
	which -- but there was a bridge on the Mbirurume -- spelling of Mbirurume, M-B -- when you cross that bridge, you get into Muko in Mukungu commune.  You cross that Mukungu (inaudible) about 3 to 4 kilometres and you reach to the Musange commune.  It's still in Gikongoro.  I stopped there at my in-laws' in Nzavu -- spelling of Nzavu, N-Z-V-U (sic).  I stopped there briefly at my in-laws'.  

	My mother-in-law was in the hospital in Kaduha because in March she had been at -- my in-laws' parents had been attacked, a grenade had been thrown in there, and you still have the scars -- she still bears the scars of that grenade.  So I stopped in Kaduha where my mother-in-law was hospitalised.  After that I went from Kaduha, still in the Karambo commune in the Gikongoro préfecture, I went to Murama in Gitarama.  And then you take the road that goes Kaduha, you pass through Masango in Gitarama commune.  After Masango you go through part of the Murama commune but really just a small part of that.  You go through Mukingi commune, Fidèle Uwizeye's commune, your witness.  You don't have to go to Butare.  You don't have to go Nyarusange-Butare to go to Murambi.  Mr. Prosecutor.
MR. WEBSTER:
I thought that the witness was addressing the Court, Your Honour.  Is there something the Court wanted to raise?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may continue.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may continue.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	When was the next time you returned to Kibuye préfecture, anywhere in Kibuye, after the 4th of May? 
A.	After the 4th of May, I might be mistaken, but I believe I returned a weekend, but I can't -- I don't know which specific weekend.  I returned during a weekend but probably maybe not the next weekend but the one after the next.  I can't be too certain, so I would not like to -- but the idea was to return to the house, to my wife.  It wasn't for a meeting whatsoever. 
Q.	And for that trip did you also travel by road from Murambi? 
A.	Yes, and I used the itinerary I just described because it is the most direct route.  And I needed to use that itinerary, Counsel for the Prosecution, if I may, to see my mother-in-law, who was also hospitalised, so that was the itinerary I would rather use. 
Q.	When you left your home that weekend, did you go back to Murambi or did you go somewhere else? 
A.	I went back to Murambi. 
Q.	And this is also by road by the same route? 
A.	Yes, most certainly. 
Q.	Did you make any trip to Kibuye town or anywhere else in the préfecture that weekend? 
A.	No, not at all. 
Q.	So basically you stayed in your home cellule or home secteur for that entire weekend.  
A.	No.  What I explained to you is that I went during one weekend.  I must have passed through Kaduha where my mother-in-law was hospitalised, and I certainly stayed there for some time at my in-laws' place.  And then I went to my house, and I probably went to church at Mukungu, and that is all.  In Mukungu I went once for mass, and I remember that when I went there it was on a weekend and I remember having gone to church with my wife in Mukungu, which is our parish. 
Q.	After that weekend, when was the next time that you were in Kibuye préfecture?  
A.	The other occasion when I remember I went to Kibuye was during the month of June, around the 20th.  I believe it was on the 20th.  In fact, at that time I had a tour I was to make.  And I remember that I had left Gisenyi, from Gisenyi spent the night in Kibuye on the 20th of June.  The following day -- you know, I had a house in Kibuye but it was rented out, so I spent the night at the hotel at Mugambira-Goldon, Mugambira's hotel.  How is it called?  That was where I spent the night.  And the following day I went to my house.  I stopped -- well, in fact, I was not stopped.  I was stopped because of the breakdown mentioned by your witness, GKA.  You will remember that he was your witness, and he said that he had seen me around those dates because he had been called upon to repair my vehicle.  My vehicle broke down on the hill to Kibuye around Gasenyi when you go up towards Karongi.  I believe you have been there.  

The vehicle broke down.  The vehicle in which I was broke down, so I left it there.  And I stopped at the following secteur office in Gitesi commune, and I asked the conseiller to go and see the bourgmestre of the commune for him to move that vehicle and take it to the garage in Kibuye.  I went on my way.  I was somewhat delayed, but I went on my way up to Mukungu.  You will see in my notebook I stopped in Mukungu.  Mukungu is our parish and there was a health centre there.  But the parish priest was not a friend, but he was an acquaintance and someone we collaborated with a lot, and he brought progress to our locality.  He was the first to bring drugs to our commune and the one who also brought the parish to our locality.  

So I went home.  That was towards the early afternoon, around 3 p.m.  And to go from my house to Birambo there is a distance of around 20 kilometres.  I went there, I saw the sous-préfet, and I went back home.  It was the end of the day.  

The following day I went to Butare via Gikongoro that time, and it was for the handover ceremony between Préfet Alphonse Nteziryayo, who was the incoming préfet -- he had been appointed on the 17th -- and Sylvain Nsabimana, who was the outgoing one.  So it was around the 20th, and this was the contents of the notes -- my notes that you are following.  I know them by heart.  
Q.	When you went to Kibuye town on the 20th of June, was that your first visit to Kibuye préfecture after becoming minister of the interior? 
A.	I beg your pardon?  I did not understand your question properly.  
Q.	When you went to Kibuye town and spent the night there on the 20th of June, was that your first visit to Kibuye préfecture after having been appointed minister of the interior on the 25th of May? 
A.	No, I do not think so.  I am not sure.  It is possible, but I cannot state so with any certainty. 
Q.	Well, then was there another visit to Kibuye préfecture between the weekend you spent with your family and your in-laws and the 20th of June when you spent the night in a hotel in Kibuye town? 
A.	No, I do not remember well, but I see what you are alluding to, Counsel for the Prosecution.  Let me answer as to make progress.  I believe I should have told you previously that the 
	Gisovu commune -- Gisovu commune at the time had a common border with the Mwendo commune.  And I now see what you are driving at.  You are alluding to Musema's letter; is that not so?  That is what you are referring to.  You don't even have a date for that letter.  But you have a date for the time when he sent me a letter and the report he had written for the director of OCIR Thé.  I believe it was on that occasion, I believe I -- perhaps I had gone to Mukungu and I had perhaps gone as far as Gisovu on that day, so it must be around the same period, the same visit.  Otherwise I do not remember having made any other visits.  So if you wish, in order to go quickly, I met Musema at his house and not at the commune, as you might have thought.  So I went all the way to Gisovu probably on that weekend when I had gone back home after the -- after church in Mukungu.  Mukungu and Gisovu are right next to one another.  I believe this is what you are driving at, so perhaps we can do so quickly. 
Q.	When you went to Gisovu to meet with Musema, were you coming from Murambi or Gisenyi or your home or Kibuye town?  Where were you coming from when you met Musema? 
A.	No, I was coming from home.  That is what I told you.  It was during the weekend when I went back home that I went to church in Mukungu, and I believe it was during that weekend that I went up to Musema's place, I believe. 
Q.	And when you left his place, where did you go, if you remember? 
A.	I went back home.  I told you that it was in the same area.  So it was at the weekend.  And after that I went back to Murambi once again.  And that is the reason for which he was giving that report to me because it was addressed to Minister Mugenzi and the director.  He could not move to go to Murambi. 
Q.	And this is on the 13th of June?
A.	That is possible, yes. 
Q.	When was it that you finally left Murambi, abandoned Murambi with the rest of the interim government? 
A.	We left Murambi on the 3rd, 3rd of June.  
Q.	And then went back there on the 13th, is that your testimony, where the RPF was waiting for you? 
A.	I beg your pardon?  No, it must be an error in my assessment.  You are correct, it must be an error.  You may continue.  I am not assessing the situation correctly. 
Q.	Well, I mean, maybe you are right.  Maybe you left Gisovu and went right back to Murambi where the RPF had advanced.
A.	Well, that is your conclusion and you are entitled to draw such a conclusion. 
Q.	Do you recall if you went back to Kibuye town from Gisovu on the day that you said you saw Musema? 
A.	I beg your pardon?
Q.	Do you recall whether or not you returned to Kibuye town and on to Gisenyi on the day that you saw Musema? 
A.	No, I am positive that I did not return to Kibuye but that I went home at Nyarusange after having met with Musema in Gisovu.  And thereafter, of course, I returned to Gisenyi, since I did not stay there until the end of the month of July.
Q.	The letter that you referred to, Mr. Karemera, is already admitted in evidence.  It's P. 193.  It's also in the bundle of exhibits that I provided to everyone.  It's document 03.  And it reads, "Your Excellency,  further to our discussion on" -- and then it is illegible where the date is indicated but it's definitely June of 1994 -- "at the Gisovu communal bureau, I am sending you a copy of the report which was sent to the director of OCIR Thé."  So your -- 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
If I may, Counsel for the Prosecution, could you give us the references of this document you are using.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I thought I had just done that but I will do it again for your benefit, Madam Diagne.  P. 193.  It's in the first binder, which I had previously indicated is the binder that I'm using today, and it's document 03.  And since I'm only referring to one sentence of it, it's really not much for you to follow, since I assume you are already familiar with it.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	But the handwritten letter from Musema to you, Mr. Karemera, is dated the 13th of June, and when he testified in his trial, he indicated that what was illegible in the letter that he wrote was the date 12 June.  So he, in his trial testimony, clarified his own handwriting on the letter that was admitted in his trial, which he acknowledged as stating that he had a discussion with you on the 12th of June at the Gisovu bureau communal.  So simply for your recollection and for the clarity of the record, let me indicate that for you.
A.  	But if I may, Counsel for the Prosecution, on the 12th of June, is this your own conclusion?  Because I saw that document, and nowhere do we see the 12th of June.  Do we agree?
Q.	Mr. Karemera, I will simply restate what I have already told you, which is that Alfred Musema himself, giving evidence in his own trial and referring to this document, clarified in his trial that what he wrote was the 12th of June as the day that he had a conversation with you, as indicated in his letter.  So simply to clarify the record, I wanted to provide you with that information.  But I will move on.  And you can find that information from his trial testimony on the 27th of May 1999 at page 53 in the English.  And he states, "Here on the document before me -- I do not see the date -- but I remember that I met him on the day before the 12th, a Sunday."  And then further down on that same page, "I reported to him on the situation in the factory and on the problems, the killings that had taken place." 

Now, having heard what Mr. Musema testified to under oath in his trial, does that seem consistent with your recollection of when you met Mr. Musema? 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
If I may, Counsel for the Prosecution, we do not follow.  Can you tell us at what page?  We have the transcripts, the ones you have just read out, Mr. Webster, please.  
MR. WEBSTER:
The transcript I have just read is not in the bundle, but I would be happy to make a copy for you and bring it to you and provide it to you after the break.  I was actually responding to a question from Mr. Karemera in pointing out the exact place in the transcript where that information is contained.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, unfortunately, I wish to inform you that we are not able to follow the proceedings because reference is being made to documents we do not have.  I believe we should have simply been told that we did not have the transcripts and that we would not be able to follow.  While he is talking we are looking at the document in the binder, and now we are being told that we do not have the document.  Can counsel for the Prosecution read excerpts of transcripts we do not have before our eyes?  Mr. President, I'm sorry to say so, but this is nonsense.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, may I continue?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Karemera.
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, Counsel for the Prosecution is showing transcripts to me that were not disclosed.  But the document he took from Musema's case, I looked at it and I was the one who reminded him that the date of the 12th that he is referring to is not on the document because the document is not legible.  Now, I do not have any difficulty, if I am given the time to check this during the break, as he has promised, but I wish to say that the inferences he is making are just that, inferences.  It is not on the document.  That was all I meant.  Otherwise I am aware of the existence of this document.  And even if it was 15 years ago that the events took place, indeed, I know that I must have been there in Gisovu after mass, and he said himself that it was on a Sunday.  So I stand to be corrected by him.  

	But I believe I should be given the opportunity to check what is in Musema's case file because a letter was disclosed in the documents that were disclosed last week.  But as for the transcripts -- well, the document is not legible, and I wonder why this document was not sent to all of us for us to realise what condition it is in.  And I wish to say that we discussed with Musema the issue of the tea factory he was to manage.  He had stocks, and I believe he had been sent by the government to the other plants in the South in Gikongoro where there were no stocks of tea to sell.  And he had written a report and he did not know what the government had done with that report, so that was what we discussed.  And in order to convince me that he had, indeed, carried out his mission and in order to make sure that the government had received his report, because during those times it was difficult to have mail circulate, he asked me to leave with a copy of that report.  And he was giving me the cover letter.  It was a handwritten document that he had annexed to his report that I was to submit to his superiors, that is to say, the minister of commerce, industry and handicrafts, and probably also the director of OCIR Thé.  But I'm trying to remember because it was a long time ago, but I do remember that specific event.
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	Where is Gisovu tea factory in relation to Bisesero? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, could you please repeat your question. 
Q.	My question to you is, isn't it true that Gisovu tea factory is on the edge of Bisesero, the region known as Bisesero? 
A.	But, Counsel for the Prosecution, you have the sketches that were drawn by your investigators.  The plant is part of a whole area.  The tea plantation goes all the way to Tumba.  All the Gisovu secteur communes are part of the plantations of the Gisovu plant.  So I do not know what has a common border with what, but Gisovu -- or rather Bisesero, the Bisesero area is -- covers both Gisovu and Gishyita communes.  One of the secteurs of Gisovu commune is part of the Bisesero zone.  So the plant is not far from Bisesero -- or, rather, the tea plantations under the direction of Musema are not far from the Bisesero area.  We agree with one another.  
Q.	Mr. Karemera, wouldn't it have been easier to simply say, "The tea factory is not far from the area of Bisesero," which is where you end up five or six sentences later?  Would you kindly just go to the heart of the question, answer it, and then we'll move on.  Now I will ask you my next question.  

You say that you have studied your journal or your diary by heart, so I'm not going to take time about asking you about every single entry that you have made.  Let me just list them for you, and you tell me if there was any other incident any other time that you circulated in Kibuye préfecture.  
According to your journal written in your handwriting, on the 21st of June you were present in Kibuye.  On the 23rd of June there was a stopover returning from -- to Gisenyi from Butare.  On the 24th of June you visited the field in Kibuye.  On the 25th of June you returned to Kibuye and had a discussion with the officer in charge.  I am assuming that is the Kibuye préfecture office.  On the 11th of July you had a meeting in Kibuye, presumably at the préfecture office.  That's five different times for which there are entries in your journal for having been present in the préfecture of Kibuye.  

Are there any other times that you were in Kibuye during the month of June and July?
A.	No, you listed the dates for a tour I made in the Kibuye préfecture, but you did not mention the 20th.  I arrived in Kibuye on the 20th of June.  I stayed there on the 21st.  On the 22nd I went to Butare.  On the 23rd I came back to Kibuye.  Once I got there, I received a letter from the government requesting that I stay in Kibuye because the Pope's envoy Cardinal Etchegaray was to transit through Kibuye coming from Butare.  So the prime minister asked that I remain in Kibuye in order to wait for this personality who, as we were told, wanted to visit the camps.  Préfet Kayishema had planned for the -- no, it was not the nuncio -- for Etchegaray to visit the Sanza camp.  Sanza is in Kibuye commune.  Spelling, S-A-N-Z-A.
(Pages 1 to 20 by Claudette Ask)	



















1030H
THE WITNESS (continued):
There were many displaced persons during that period, and that was where the préfet had hoped for the -- it's not the nuncio.  I'm forgetting what the position of Monsieur Etchegaray was for the time being.  

On the 24th or the 25th, I was still in Kibuye in order to wait for this personality to arrive.  The RPF had already taken up positions in Gitarama and in a major part of Gikongoro.  And for security reasons, the Pope's envoy did not go all the way to Sanze but, rather, passed through the top of the hill.  He went from -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, could the witness start all over again because he's going too fast for the interpreters to follow him.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Karemera, the interpreters have lost you, and they request that you start again.  
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, that is because the Prosecutor does not allow me to complete my explanation.  
	Let me -- let me try and explain without wasting too much of his time.  

So the period that he has mentioned, I am in agreement with him on all of this, because I remember that I had planned, myself, to take advantage of my trip from Gisenyi to Butare with -- to combine it with the -- to coincide with the visit to some camps of internationally displaced persons.  And that is why I left Gisenyi on 20 June.  

This is off the cuff because the Prosecutor has -- he has the diary, and I'm just trying to remember it offhand.  20 June I left Gisenyi.  I remember that I stopped in Rutsiro because that is -- that is the road you take when you are going from Gisenyi to Kibuye.  I arrived Kibuye.  I spent a night in Kibuye.  I explained to him that, indeed, I spent the night at the Golden Rock hotel in Mugambira.  

The following day, on the 21st, I went up to my home by -- through Mukungu.  I have already spelled Mukungu.  When I arrived home, I rested a little bit, but before nightfall, I went to Birambo, and I returned home.  I spent the night there.  

The following day, I went from my home, on the 22nd, that is, because that is -- on that day I was still in Kibuye.  Although, having said so, I went from my home to Butare for -- for the handing-over ceremony between Alphonse Nteziryayo, who had been appointed préfet on the 17th, and Sylvain Nsabimana.  

After that ceremony, I believe I spent the night -- I can't be too sure, but I believe I spent the night in Gikongoro, on the 22nd.  And on the 23rd, during the day, after a small meeting with the préfet and, I think, the directeur de cabinet, whom I believe was in the area, that is, Kalimanzira, Callixte, I went up to Kibuye.  

When I arrived Kibuye, I received a message from the prime minister asking me to wait there till the following day to go and welcome the special envoy of the Pope, Cardinal -- let me put it down so I don't forget.  Cardinal Etchegaray.  I think that was on the 25th that we waited for him at Sanze, but he did not come because security did not allow him to use the road from Butare through Nyanza, through Bwakira, then Kivumu, where the internally displaced persons were found in Sanze.  

The préfet, who had been there to wait for him at the border between Gitarama and Kibuye, was notified at the last minute that the cardinal was arriving in the préfecture.  He quickly got to Kibuye to wait for him there.  He didn't even have the time to notify me, although I was waiting for them in the camp in Sanze in the Kivumu commune.  

Around 3 to 4 p.m., we noticed that the visitor who was expected would no longer come, so I returned to Kibuye.  I was just arriving in Kibuye in -- around a roundabout in Kibuye, which I'm sure Webster knows, that is where I met the cardinal leaving Kibuye for Gisenyi by road.  I would not even have had a chance to greet him, because he didn't even leave his car.  On the 24th, therefore, I spent the night again in Kibuye.  

On the 26th of June, before I went to Gisenyi, I went from Kibuye to Nyarusange, to my home.  I took my wife and my children.  And then I returned.  That is why a witness said that at that time I had gone to tell the Hutu intellectuals to flee because the RPF had taken over power, because he saw me leaving with my wife and my children.  That was on the 26th of June.  I went back on the same road, Nyarusenge-Gisenyi-Kibuye.  

After stopping in Kibuye -- I took the trip to Kibuye in Gisenyi, I stopped in Rubengera, at Munyampundu, Cyprien.  After Rubengera, I went -- it is likely that I stopped at the Rutsiro bourgmestre's house, Raphael -- Raphael.  Then I went to Gisenyi, where I arrived in the evening.  That was on the 26th.  

So you mentioned the date of the 11th of July.  That is correct.  On the 11th of July, I was in a meeting with the administrative authorities of the south.  I had already held a meeting with the administrative authorities of the northern zone on the 7th of July in Ngurorero.  

On the 11th of July, I was in Kibuye, indeed, in the meeting which brought together authorities from the southern area, because it was very difficult at the time to meet the authorities.  Communication was almost impossible.  So the only way of knowing who was doing what was to take an appointment with them.  And those in the south,  I gave an appointment in Kibuye on the 11th.  

I went with my nephew, who is dead, Dusabamana.  Dusabamana, Epaphrodite.  Spelling, D-U-S-A-B-A-M-A-N-A.  He was a sergeant in the army.  He had been shot in the stomach at the Kigali front.  And when I arrived Kigali with my wife, people definitely knew I had arrived.  And before then, I would have arrived at night in the hotel, where I have a room.  

But when I arrived with my wife, as she testified here, we found a house which was not inhabited, a CEPGL house.  And as minister of the interior with children who was not from Gisenyi -- I mean, these are things people say.  People heard about it.  People talked about it.  And my nephew, who was dying in hospital, knew that I was nearby.  

In the evening, when I returned from a displaced persons' camp, I met him at home, and he was dying.  On the 11th, therefore, I took him with me in Kibuye, because in Gisenyi there was a huge amount of people.  And since I had a sister who lived in Kibuye, I took my nephew with me with the hope of treating him in Kibuye, where there were less people.  

So on the 11th I had a meeting.  On the 12th I went to my parents' home to find out what the situation was.  So on the 12th -- so on the 11th I was in a meeting.  On the 12th I went to my parents', and then I returned on Kibuye.  I didn't spend the night.  

When I arrived in Kibuye -- and that's where I will end, Mr. Prosecutor.  When I arrived in Kibuye, 
	the -on the night, I thought I would be able to go back early in the morning to Gisenyi.  But when I woke up, my nephew had died.  And my law -- brother-in-law, who was nearby, who was taking care of him, came and told me at 6 a.m., just before I left, that the boy had died.  

So I no longer went to Gisenyi.  I stayed there for the burial.  So I sent the vehicle back to the house to get my sister, the mother of Nsabimana, and we carried on with his burial.  After his burial, the following day, on the 14th, I believe, I returned to Gisenyi. 

Mr. Prosecutor, if you have other date when I was in the Kibuye préfecture which I no longer recall, please tell me.  I am going to -- I have nothing to hide, Your Honour.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I think we can take the break now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We take our mid-morning recess now.
(Court recessed from 1041H to 1117H)  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  Mr. Karemera -- 
A.	My apologies.  The microphone was not on.  I'm sorry.  
Q.	Based on your testimony earlier this morning, it's clear that you were driving quite a bit all around Kibuye during the period the 20th of June to the 11th of July.  Wouldn't you agree?  You made several trips, at least five or six different trips, by road to your hometown, to Kibuye town, to Gisovu tea -- to Gisovu bureau communal.  You were driving all over Kibuye préfecture.  
A.	I drove what?  
Q.	Wasn't it apparent to you that there was massive and systematic attacks against the Tutsi population in Kibuye based on what you could see driving around in June of 1994?  
A.	Driving what?  
Q.	Is that your (microphones overlapping)?  
A.	I was not a driver.  
Q.	Was it not apparent to you that tens of thousands of Tutsis had been attacked and killed in Kibuye by mid-June, when you were circulating by road from Kibuye town to Mwendo, to Murambi to the 
	Gisovu communal office?  
A.	Because you mean that the roads I was using passed through Bisesero; is that what you're saying?  I told you that I stayed in Kibuye, and I told you what my activities were.  I indicated the routes I used.  So what do you want me to answer you?  
Q.	Is it your testimony that you were completely unaware of the systematic attacks against the Tutsi population in Kibuye during June of 1994, when you were circulating in the préfecture by road?  
A.	But which attacks?  The attacks you have listed in the indictment?  What attacks are you referring to?  
Q.	I'll repeat my question.  Is it your testimony that you were unaware of systematic attacks against the Tutsi population committed by Interahamwe and local residents in Kibuye during the month of June, when you were circulating by road?  
A.	No.  
Q.	You were not aware?  
A.	What does that mean, "be aware"?  
Q.	Perhaps I should repeat it in French, because obviously you do not understand.  
A.	Yes.  You do not know what you're asking me, and this is why I -- I find it difficult to answer you.  
Q.	Were you aware of the killings against the Tutsi population in Kibuye in June 1994?  
A.	I was aware of the battles, the hard-fought battles, between the RPF infiltrators, who were leading the refugees in the Bisesero area.  I was aware of the fact that there were battles.  And sometimes during the night, the refugees, with the assistance of the RPF infiltrators, would descend upon the secteurs around the Bisesero area in order to get supplies, because in June they no longer had reserves.  The reserves they had set up were depleted.  And when they would attack, the population would defend itself.  

I was also informed by the inhabitants of the area around Bisesero and Bisesero itself that in Bisesero there was -- or, rather, Mr. -- Counsel for the Prosecution, there were RPF members, and the population was afraid of them.  I was informed of that.  

I was informed that the RPF had infiltrated the area and that its reserves had been depleted because of the significant number of people who had sought refuge there, because the RPF had broadcast on the radio an appeal to the Tutsis to ask them to come and assist them in Bisesero.  

And the people had gone there coming from all the neighbouring communes, Rwamatamu, Gitesi, Gisovu, and even some communes of Gikongoro.  And your witnesses have confirmed that.  So I was informed about all that.  
Q.	I'll continue in English.  It's your testimony -- well, excuse me.  Let me rephrase.  There are credible accounts that over 200,000 Tutsi were killed in Kibuye alone from the period April to July of 1994.  Is it your suggestion that 200,000 Tutsi were killed by the RPF brigades that you allude to?  
A.	But who told you that only the Tutsis were killed in Kibuye?  Who told you that?  Who is we?  It is you, Mr. -- Counsel for the Prosecution, who is saying that.  And you don't even know how many people were killed.  Because, Counsel for the Prosecution, the Kigali regime refused -- refused to have any census made.  

When you're talking about thousands of Tutsis, Counsel for the Prosecution, how many Tutsis were there in the Bisesero secteur?  What was the population of Bisesero?  Tell me.  The thousands of people you are referring to, where did they come from, and what were they doing there?  Who urged them to go there?  That is the matter at hand.  That is what we need to discuss.  

With statistics, tell me.  Gishyita commune, how many inhabitants were there?  And what was the population of Gishyita in 1994?  And what was the proportion of Tutsis among that population for you to talk about thousands of Tutsis who were killed?  We need figures.  

And I'm sure that Ibuka -- you know Ibuka, don't you?  "Remember".  That is what it means in French.  What figures were given to you by Ibuka?  The dictionary says "genocide".  

Do you know why he was not prosecuted?  When you're talking about the Tutsis killed, Counsel for the Prosecution, you have to provide us with statistics.  And I wish, along with you and along with the international community and mankind -- deplore the dead who -- the senseless deaths of Hutus, Tutsis and Twas who fell victim of the folly of President Kagame, who wanted to seize power.  

Did you read Ruzibiza's book?  I can quote the page to you, and you can check.  Were the Tutsis not ready -- the RPF Tutsis not ready to go to Bisesro, as had been announced on Radio Muhabura, to protect -- or, rather, to reinforce the position held by infiltrators, by brigades?  Aren't you aware of that?  Or are you simply not mentioning it in order to -- not -- not to have the truth come to the fore?  

Mr. Prosecutor, I am on trial because -- you are -- have the better role.  But it is my people.  Hutus and Tutsis are Rwandans, as you well know.  And you know that I feel strongly because of all these killings.  But I am even more hurt when you come to discriminate among the dead, because there were Hutus who were pro-RPF.  Counsel for the Prosecution, there were pro-RPF Hutus who went to Bisesero.  Do you understand that at least?  No, you don't.   
Q.	(Microphone not activated)...your own witnesses, your own defence witnesses, peasants, uninstructed people, who came here to testify on your behalf, who never left their home communes, were able to tell this Court about the attacks against the Tutsi in Kibuye town when they had never even been to Kibuye town.  They were able to tell this Court about attacks that they knew of against Bisesero without even going to Bisesero.  

You, a government minister circulating in a vehicle with a military escort, you are going to tell this Court that you were not aware of those systematic attacks against the Tutsi in Kibuye?  
A.	But, Counsel for the Prosecution, let me tell you once again that what I do not accept from you, because you have information, is that you mix up the infiltrators and the RPF supporters with the Tutsi.  And this is a confusion you have been making ever since our paths met, during even my initial appearance.  You were there, in front of camera, and you know that.  

The Tutsis were killed.  I'm not denying that, and I'm not saying that I was not aware of that.  But Hutus were killed.  And among the Tutsis who were in Bisesro, there were Hutus, Counsel for the Prosecution, who all shared the same ideal and wanted to support their -- and these Tutsis, if they were not alone, if they had not had Twagiramungu, Seth Sendashonga, Counsel for the Prosecution -- and all the ones I've just mentioned are not Tutsis.  If he had not had all these people with him, if they -- if they had not had Gatsinzi, Marcel -- you know him.  He was the chief of staff of our armed forces.  You know where he is now.  And all of them, they are not Tutsis.  And you know that, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	So is your evidence that the 200,000 people that were killed in Kibuye, Kibuye alone, were all accomplices and infiltrators that deserved to die?  
A.	But now you're saying 2,000.  Your learned colleague, Morley, was talking about 20,000 people.
Q.	Well, let me correct what I said, or correct your impression of what I said.  Mr. Morley talked about 20,000 people that were killed in Gatwaro stadium alone, 20,000 in Gatwaro stadium in 
	Kibuye préfecture, the town of Kibuye.  Two hundred thousand killed throughout Kibuye préfecture, including Bisesero.  Are you suggesting that these are the infiltrators that were killed?  
A.	Where did you get the 200,000 from, Counsel for the Prosecution?  From which document have you extracted such a figure?  In Gatwaro -- I will tell you and repeat it to you, since it seems you do not know that Gatwaro is in the centre of Kibuye town.  So when you're saying Gatwaro and that -- you're saying that Gatwaro is not in Kibuye town, this makes me laugh because it is ridiculous.  Gatwaro is Kibuye, just as St. Jean is in Kibuye.  

When you take it -- Gatwaro out and when you reach St. Jean, what is left?  What other site do you have left?  But you are giving figures just like that, and I'm sorry because even -- this is not at -- the level at which we're having this discussion, even a dead person...

And I do not endorse at all this confusion you're making. You're talking about 2,000.  When I'm telling you is it 2,000 or 20,000, you are telling me it's 20,000 in Gatwaro, 2,000 in Kibuye.  So what are we to believe?  Is it 2,000 in Kibuye instead of 2,000 in Gatwaro, since next to Gatwaro there was 
	Home St. Jean?  Or are you talking about 20,000?  

And could you tell me what is your source for these statistics?  When you are talking about 200,000 people killed in Bisesero, where did that population come from?  Kibuye préfecture had around 380,000 inhabitants.  Are you -- do you want me to believe that there were 200,000 Tutsis in Kibuye?  Is that what you want the Trial Chamber to believe?  Counsel for the Prosecution, please review your assessment.  I apologise.  
Q.	Didn't Alfred Musema, himself, tell you on the 12th of June when you saw him at the Gisovu commune office that killings of Tutsi were taking place at the Gisovu tea factory?  Because that's what he testified to on the 27th of March 1999.  
A.	Where did he say that?  Where?  Where did he say it?  You did not even disclose that transcript.  In any case, what do you want me to do with Musema's statements?  
Q.	I say to you -- 
A.	You have -- Prosecutor, let me answer.  Let me finish what I have to say.  

	You are talking about Musema.  We are talking about the document.  You did not even disclose that document to my collaborators.  And beyond that document, that note which you transmitted -- the report asking me to send it to his superiors, what more has he said on Karemera, Édouard?  Nothing.  Karemera.  Because, otherwise -- now you brought him as a witness.  

Now, don't tell me about what Musema said.  What he said, that's what got him convicted.  And 
	I do -- am not going to get convicted by Musema's statements.  Even if you introduce that as a tried and convicted case, that, you know.  
Q.	My question to you is did Alfred Musema tell you on the 12th of June, when you were present with him at the Gisovu commune office, that the Tutsi were being attacked at the tea factory?  Or is it your evidence --  
A.	He told me nothing to that effect.  
Q.	What did Kayishema tell you was going on in Kibuye when you would meet with him?  
A.	Prosecutor, Préfet Kayishema, I met him on the 3rd of May 1994.  His statement was made -- you have his statement with you.  Préfet Kayishema sent the telegram -- the telegram you are well aware of, on which I am sure we are going to discuss -- on the 12th, 12th of June.  Préfet Kayishema was part of the préfets who had attended the meeting which we held on the 11th of July 1994.  

What is your question on any of those dates?  I will give you a clear answer.  If you don't -- and if you don't have comments, what -- do you want me to invent any form of communication that Kayishema would have done (inaudible)?  Nothing, except what you have and which you do not want to disclose because it does not incriminate me at all.  Nothing.  That, you know, Prosecutor.  
Q.	All right.  Let's start with the telegram from Kayishema.   
MR. WEBSTER:
Can you -- Mr. Registrar, can you please give the witness the document 02, which is the telegram that he just made reference to.  And in English it's 01 in the bundle of documents that I distributed last week.  It's also an exhibit in this case.  It is P. 53, B in English and A in French.  
THE WITNESS:
I have it, Prosecutor.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Okay.  All right.  Let's just look at the document globally to begin with.  Is this what you received?  In other words, you see at the bottom there's a signature and the stamp -- signature of Kayishema and the stamp on the bottom of the page, which is the stamp of the préfecture.  

You've already acknowledged that you received the telegram.  Is this the form in which you received it back in June of 1994?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, where did I recognise that I received this telegram?  Where?  Come on, tell me.  Remind me.  Where did I receive this telegram?  I said I know it.  But knowing and receiving is different.  I know it because I was in a meeting of the cabinet meeting that examined this document on 17 June.  It is different.  

You see, I was copied to the ministry of defence from Kibuye.  Do you have any proof, Mr. Prosecutor?  You can table before the Chamber that I received this.  Let me explain why I did not receive this and why Kayishema had to make a second copy.  

	Firstly, on the 9th -- further to my telegram of 9 June to the minister of the interior, MININTER, that's minister of the interior -- that was me -- but I had not received it.  And on the 12th another attempt was made by sending it to the minister of defence. 

I have said from my testimony what communication means we had.  They were miserly.  And Kayishema noticed that a telegram that was sent to the minister of the interior would -- was unlikely going to get to the ministry.  That is why the - he went to ministry of defence, which had the army.  Your collaborator there, behind you -- and that telegram, I heard about it in the cabinet meeting of 17th July, which was chaired by the prime minister, Kambanda, who had likely received it from the ministry of defence.  

So this is a document sent by Kayishema, but that -- don't say that I remember having received it.  I did not receive the copy that was sent to me because the communication facilities at the time did not allow me to receive it, so I did not receive it.  But I recognise the contents of the telegram as discussed in the cabinet meeting.  
Q.	Did you receive a copy of the telegram in the cabinet meeting?  That's my question to you.  
A.	Prime Minister Kambanda, who was your witness, whom you could not bring before the Chamber, read -- he read the telegram, and we discussed on that basis.  
Q.	Did you see the telegram?  
A.	When?  
Q.	In the cabinet meeting of the 17th of June, when you suggest you heard about it for the first time.  
A.	Yes.  He distributed the document.  You know, we were in Muramba, away.  It isn't in your offices here.  You didn't have photocopiers.  It isn't as if Kambanda was trying to hide anything from us.  We did not have documents.  We were working with what we had.  He sent the paper around, and everybody took a look at it, including me.  
Q.	And is this the document that was circulated on the 17th of June?  
A.	Yes.  Indeed, that is the copy.  No, that is not what was said.  I believe -- I mean, we understand each other on that.  
Q.	Okay.  Let's read it together now.  

"Further to my telegram" -- well, actually, let's stop at the very top.  You've explained that this is the document that you saw on the 17th of June.  It starts with the word "telegram" at the very top.  Right?  
A.	Yes, indeed.  I can read that.  
Q.	Can we agree that this is not a telegram; this is a letter?  Right?  
A.	But that is a question you should have asked Kayishema.  Why didn't you ask him?  He would 
	have -what did he tell you, since he had been tried?  What is the difference between this and the telegram?  
Q.	Mr. Karemera, the question is very simple and very direct.  Do you agree that this is a letter; this is not a telegram in the form that it usually arrives at a military location?  Correct?  Yes or no?  
A.	That is the question Kayishema is allowed to answer, or your -- 
Q.	Are you refusing -- 
A.	-- neighbour behind.  
Q.	Are you refusing to answer the question, as simple as it is?  
A.	But I answered.  I answered, Mr. Prosecutor.  I am not the person who wrote this, but I can see it is written "telegram".  And that is how I talked about telegram.  I didn't write that.  
Q.	And my suggestion to you, Mr. Karemera, is that there were two communications:  One in this form, which is a letter that was either sent by fax or hand delivered, and another that was sent in telegram form, which you have seen before because they are exhibits in this case.  

Communication was operating on two levels, through military channels and telegrams and through civilian channels by fax.  So that's what I am suggesting to you, number one.  And let's continue.  It's dated the 12th of June.  You agree?  
A.	Yes.  The date is correct.  
Q.	And he continues: 

"Further to my telegram of the 9th of June to the ministry of the interior, copied to you, regarding security matters in Bisesero secteur of Gishyita commune, the people of the area are ready to undertake a clean-up operation in the interest of civil defence."

Wouldn't that sentence suggest to you that the civil defence programme was up and running on the 12th of June, when Préfet Kayishema sent a telegram and this letter to the ministry of defence?  
A.	I'm sorry, I didn't quite hear the beginning of this.  I got the end, but the beginning, I kind of lost you.  I didn't quite get the interpretation.  Please, the beginning.  
Q.	Doesn't that first sentence, read in its entirety, ending with the phrase "ready to undertake a clean-up operation in the interest of civil defence" -- doesn't that sentence standing on its own suggest to you that a civil defence programme was operational in Kibuye at least for Clément Kayishema?  
A.	Of course, you say for Clément Kayishema.  But for me I, candidly, cannot deduce that from that phrase.  And let me tell you why.  Because in this statement, Mr. Prosecutor, Clément Kayishema was referring to the Bisesero secteur in the Gishyita commune.  But your investigators know that Bisesero is larger than that.  

And if I put it to you that Kayishema wrote this probably without being sound of mind, what would you say about my suggestion?  Because that's where we are getting to, Mr. Prosecutor.  Carry on.  I'm ready for you.  
Q.	What did you understand him to mean when you read the word "clean-up operation", or "ratissage" in the French?  
A.	Witness -- Mr. Prosecutor, I am not a soldier, but I understand French.  The word "sweeping operation" is a military term.  And that is how I understood it, and that is how the entire government understood it.  And that is why what comes afterwards, we show you that we did not invent this.  I didn't invent this.  I didn't invent the words of the "sweeping operation", which you have in my letter, sending government's decision on the 18th.  

The word comes from Kayishema, and Kayishema, himself, I believe, took it from his deputy at the head of the security in the Kibuye préfecture.  That is Major Jabo, who was a soldier.  It is likely that person who wrote this text -- likely, I would like to state, because I don't assert anything, because I was not there when it was written.  But both of them, and Kayishema, préfet, and Jabo, the commander of the gendarmerie in Kibuye, were in charge of the people's security in Kibuye, including the Tutsi, the Hutu and the Twa, who were killing each other in Bisesero, not in Bisesero secteur, as Kayishema writes.  
Q.	Let's move to the next sentence.  "I have the honour to request you to give the Kibuye commander a formal order to oversee the operation."  I believe you've just identified to us -- for us who the commander was.  You referred to a Lieutenant Jabo.  Is that correct?  
A.	No.  Major Jabo.  
Q.	Isn't it a bit unusual that the préfet of the préfecture would have to request a formal order from the ministry of defence to have the commander of the gendarmerie assume his responsibility for protecting the population?  
A.	And what if Major Jabo himself had asked him to assist him?  Because I tell you, I was not there with them.  Major Jabo had -- indeed, had to write not to the minister of defence but, rather, to the gendarmerie chief of staff to get instructions or to report.  So as -- but since April, May, June, Bisesero had become a major problem he was unable to solve, what makes you think that in the préfectoral security committee he had not -- they had not arrived at the conclusion that they needed reinforcements and that the reinforcement could be gendarmes, of course, but they could also be soldiers?  And that - that may be the reason why I believe that Kayishema -- since Kayishema was not a soldier, it was Jabo who drafted this document on his behalf.  

But as I said, I am not saying anything with certainty.  This is pure speculation, because I didn't meet Jabo.  I did not discuss with Kayishema regarding this telegram.  And I cannot see why you are putting such suggestions to me.  
Q.	And my suggestion to you, Mr. Karemera, is that a préfet of the préfecture was able to coordinate with a commander of the gendarmerie without having to go to a higher authority to do so, but that Préfet Kayishema had to appeal to a high authority when Jabo was concerned because Jabo was not going to implicate himself in the killings.  

So he made an appeal to you and then to the minister of defence so that a formal order could be issued so that this reluctant Major Jabo would get with the programme.  That's my suggestion to you.  And to me that's implicit in that sentence. 
A.	Well, you are the one who's telling me that Major Jabo was reluctant to protect this civilian population he was responsible for.  Well, if you -- if you knew this, why would I doubt it?  But that's not the question.  The question you're asking me is about the telegram, and I put it to you that it was inspired by Jabo, because Kayishema was not a soldier, and I don't see why he would go and talk about sweeping operations.  

But maybe that was not the case.  And maybe that is also why -- you are probably right when we look at the rest of the documents.  So I will let you carry on.  But I do not -- I reject your suggestion.  In any case, I do not agree with it.  
Q.	Wasn't Jabo transferred from Kibuye to the battle front on the eastern flank of the country upon the direction of the order of the interim government after this letter, or sometime after this letter, or towards the latter part of the genocide?  If you know, say yes.  If you don't, say, "I don't know."  And if you disagree, just say -- just give us an answer.  
A.	No.  You're confusing yourself.  Jabo was, for a short while at the beginning of April, after the RPF attack -- then he went to the Kigali front to the PVK, alongside some gendarmes, to support the Kigali -- the Kigali gendarmerie, to protect the Rugwiro village.  

And it was at around that same area that Habyarimana was carrying out hearings, because it had been -- the government had broken into two, sort of, because the meetings of government were held on the Hôtel du 5 Juillet.  But let me carry on.  Since you are talking about the instant front -- 
Q.	Your answer is not responsive.  You said no.  You said -- you said it was in April and not in June.  And that's all we need to know.  We don't need to know about the details of what President Habyarimana was doing at Rugwiro village.  The question was very specific.  We can move on.  
A.	It was not in the village.  It was in the Rugwiro village.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Excuse me, Your Honour, Mr. President.  I'd like to pray the Chamber to allow -- to ask Mr. Webster to allow Mr. Karemera to explain himself and to drop his requirements of yes or no answers, because these ambiguous, confused and unclear questions do not need a yes or no answer.  Mr. Karemera wants to answer questions completely, or those questions should not be asked.  

MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, may I proceed?  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, the Prosecutor would carry on, I'm sure.  I'm sure the Prosecutor would be able to continue, but I'd like him to come to terms with the fact that Mr. Karemera is not merely a witness here, so the techniques he's expecting -- he's trying to use with a usual witness will not be the same for Mr. Karemera, who's also an accused.  

So when you put questions to Mr. Karemera, of course, it is the witness who answers, but it is also the Accused, the Accused in a very sensitive trial.  And if somebody has to be patient and listen, that has to be the Prosecutor.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I believe one of the issues also, Mr. Webster asks mainly subquestions in questions.  And when you have these subquestions which are not clearly defined, it is difficult to have a clear answer as well.  

On several occasions this morning, we've seen that each question was asked in such a way that it is difficult to have a precise answer.  And -- because usually it is broken down into three.  And it is difficult to answer clearly.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Karemera, I believe you answered the question with your first sentence.  You believe that the transfer was in April.  I suggested to you that it was after this letter.  The first two sentences of your answer were sufficient to respond to my enquiry.  So I'll move on.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, that is not what my client said.  I would like Mr. Karemera to repeat his answer, because these are complete opposite of what the Prosecutor has said.  I mean, the Prosecutor does not realise that he is mistaken.  

With your leave, Mr. President, I would like the client, Mr. Karemera, to repeat -- in any case, for my own purposes, he should repeat his answer.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I suggest that Ms. Diagne await her turn in redirect.  I'm moving on.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Karemera, are you aware that Pauline Nyiramasuhuko -- 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I would like to know if you have authorised, for my better understanding, that I be allowed to - a better understanding.  I didn't -- I asked -- I didn't ask Mr. Webster.  I asked you.  If you feel that I don't need clarification on that point, let me know, and then I'll sit down.  But it is not incumbent upon Mr. Webster to answer the authorisation to better understand.  It's to be given by you.  So you can tell me to take my seat, which I will do it forthwith.  But I ask for your authorisation.  I pleaded with the Court, not Mr. Webster.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  I've been listening with great interest, and I feel that Mr. Karemera is taking care of the situation quite well.  At this stage, I don't think we need to intervene.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Karemera, are you aware that, like you, Minister Pauline Nyiramasuhuko also kept an agenda or a diary of meetings of the cabinet?  And portions of her diary have been admitted in evidence in this case.  And with respect to the meeting that took place on the 17th of June 1994, she indicates in her diary that Jabo was stopping or interfering with an action in Bisesero.  Wouldn't that statement of itself suggest to you that the reason a formal order was required from the ministry of defence was because Jabo was reluctant to get involved with further killings in Bisesero?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I have a lot of respect for Madam Pauline Nyiramasuhuko.  Lots of respect, indeed.  But I am not -- how can I say this?  I mean, it's not a joke, you know.  But beyond that, her diary, Mr. Prosecutor, where you submit this into evidence -- even if you did so, doesn't become truth because you tendered it.  It is a document from Pauline.  You see, it's not even a diary.  It is a notebook.  

And I'm sure it isn't because I didn't have a diary, because when I left my home I went with nothing.  And when I took office to -- to keep track of decisions taken by government, as I usually did when I was a member of Habyarimana's government from -- from 29th -- I remind you, April -- 29th April 1981 up till 15 January 1989, I was a cabinet member.  And before that, I was legal adviser at the president of the republic.  

Now, let me carry on.  Let me finish, Mr. Prosecutor.  This is not going to work -- 
Q.	I'm going on to my next question.  Going back -- 
A.	No.  No.  No, Mr. Prosecutor.  

	Mr. President, Mr. Prosecutor cannot afford to overlook my diary and bring Pauline's diary.  That is inadmissible.  Pauline's diary is hers, and she's on trial before this Tribunal.  So what makes you believe that this diary is going to be accepted as a credible document?  

You have fought with your witness, and now you're trying to impose Pauline Nyiramasuhuko's diary on me, in which you have the cost of potatoes, you have the cost of this and that.  Come on.  Untwine this before asking these questions to me, Mr. Prosecutor.  

I have respect for you.  I apologise.  But kindly do not bring me Pauline's diary.  I mean, it's a hodgepodge compressing everything, and set up by Mr. Guichaoua, a witness of yours who did not appear.  And by the way, he was saying a lot of goods -- good about me.  And that, you know, Mr. Witness -- Mr. Prosecutor.  You know that a book has been written based on this diary, and I don't want to discuss this diary.  
Q.	Moving on.  Let's look at the -- let's skip one sentence.  We may come back to it.  He continues:  "The following ammunition will be required to carry out the operation."  And then above, he describes the operation as lasting -- or it's anticipated to last four days.  

So let's look at what he wants for a four-day operation.  Gun grenades, at least 30.  In the French, just to repeat, grenades à fusil, at least 30.  Doesn't that phrase alone suggest to you that the guns are already there?  All he wants are the 30 grenades to be attached to the guns.  

We don't know how many guns he has already, but it's clear from that phrase alone that he's not asking you for the guns for the grenades.  All he wants are the 30 grenades to be used with the guns that he already has.  Doesn't that suggest to you that a civil defence programme is operational?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
I wish to raise an objection, Mr. President.  I believe this question is based on speculation, and I wish for this question not to be authorised.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We think Mr. Karemera can answer the question.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, I'm ready to answer the question.  

	Counsel for the Prosecution, was that the advice given to you by Nsanzimfura?  Nsanzimfura in his -- is in your team, and he's a soldier.  I'm not a soldier.  But he did not explain to you how a sweeping-out operation is carried out?  Does one require gun grenades in order to carry out such an operation, Counsel for the Prosecution?  Did you not ask yourself that question?
MR. WEBSTER:
First of all, and, Your Honour, I'm appealing to the Court, I would request that Mr. Karemera refrain from identifying specific members of my team and incorporating disparaging remarks in his response.  That's number one.  And that's a request I'm making to the Court, for the Court to make a specific instruction to Mr. Karemera to be responsive to the question.
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I wish to apologise.  I have taken note of the position expressed by Counsel for the Prosecution Webster.  When he says that I am talking about his colleagues, he's right,  and I wish to apologise to him.  And I also wish to apologise to his colleague Nsanzimfura.  

But I wish to tell counsel for the Prosecution that, indeed, because Kayishema is not a soldier, this is why he writes such things.  And when counsel for the Prosecution draws the conclusion that it is because the weapons had already been distributed, the only thing I can do is laugh, honestly, because counsel for the Prosecution knows that the government did not follow Kayishema in his proposals because the government was not made up of nutcases.  

Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution, our decision was to say that this operation, if it was to be carried out, should be undertaken by operations technicians, by soldiers.  And yet you're telling me about grenades, at least 30 hand grenades, at least 50 bullets for R4 rifles, four magazines for machine guns.  I do not even know what these terms mean.  

But what I do know, and that was what the government thought, was that it was -- that such a suggestion by Préfet Kayishema was strange, and our answer was no.  We said that the inhabitants of Gishyita were not competent in order to carry out a clean-up operation.  

And I would urge you to refer to my letter of the 18th rapidly, because then you will be enlightened.  But if you do not wish to do that and continue putting questions to me on military terminology used by Kayishema any which way -- earlier on, I was saying that he was advised by Jabo.  You told me that Jabo could not advise Kayishema, but that was -- but he was his technical adviser.  Okay, I concede this to you, and I refer you to the position adopted by the government in this matter.  The position of the government was that what Kayishema was asking for could not be endorsed by the government.  And we did not endorse this proposal made by Kayishema and this document. 
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	Let's move on to the next item.  Hand grenades, at least 50.  Well, I would agree -- or I would concede that anybody can use a hand grenade.  But he goes on to ask for bullets for R4 rifles.  He doesn't ask for rifles.  He just asks for bullets for rifles.  Wouldn't that suggest to any reasonable observer that that phrase in itself, in the context of this letter -- suggests that guns are already available to Préfet Kayishema?  
A.	But, Counsel for the Prosecution, since Préfet Kayishema was tried, you certainly put that question to him, and you know what his answer was.  I wonder why you are not telling me what answer he gave to the question you are putting to me today.  

Did he say that he had distributed weapons and that all he needed were bullets in order to supply the Gishyita population, who wants to carry out this clean-up operation?  Was that the answer he gave when he was in the witness stand?  Because I know he testified.  
Q.	We are going to get the portions of his testimony, I assure you.  But let's look at the next entry:  Four magazines for machine guns.  He's not asking for machine guns, just four magazines for 
	machine guns.  
And, incidentally, I can remind you, Mr. Karemera, that Clément Kayishema was convicted by this Tribunal and sentenced to life imprisonment, I believe.  And this Trial Chamber has incorporated a number of findings from his trial as evidence in this trial.  Among them, adjudicated fact numbers 69, and 71, and 70, and 85, and 95, all of which make factual findings that, during the period between the 8th and 9th of April and the 30th of June 1994, Tutsis sought refuge in Bisesero, and that they were attacked and killed at approximately 12 sites in the Bisesero area.  

There are at least 10 or 15 separate factual findings from the Karemera - excuse me, Kayishema trial that have been accepted in evidence in this trial that document the massive and systematic attacks against the Tutsi population, the civilian Tutsi population in Bisesero.  

And coming back -- 
A.	So?  
Q.	-- to the question, wouldn't it suggest to you that a request for magazines for machine guns would indicate that the person making the request already has a machine gun?  
A.	But, Counsel for the Prosecution, let me answer your question with a question.  Do you have any evidence whereby the people who were killed in Bisesero, as you are stating and as accepted as adjudicated fact in the Kayishema trial -- do you have evidence that they were killed using machine guns and R4 rifles?  Is that the proposition you are making to me and you wish for me to approve?  I fail to understand you.  I fail to understand you because, Counsel for the Prosecution, you know that that was not how things took place.  

It is unfortunate that people were killed there.  I regret that.  But I also deplore the fact that you are continuing to create this confusion by saying that they were killed because R4 rifles, machine guns and hand grenades were distributed.  Frankly, where are we?  

Do you know that the events in April to June 1994 did not take place in the way you're describing them?  And you carried out investigations for 15 years.  During the 15 years you carried out investigations, and now you're falsely stating that the Tutsis, the pro-RPF Tutsis and Hutus who were killed in Bisesero were killed using machine guns and R4 rifles, when you personally brought witnesses before this Court who said the reverse.  

How did they say the attacks were taking place?  You know that.  You brought at least two witnesses, AMM, AMN.  They said that there were people who were armed, and notably Musema, but that -- even that they were almost able to take the rifle from Musema, as they claimed that he was armed.  But you know that Musema was not armed.  You knew that they were fighting there but not necessarily with firearms.  You are aware of that, Counsel for the Prosecution.  

	Let me go to the end of my response.  No, I wish to answer.  You know that even among the refugees, they were not armed, even if there were infiltrators who were armed.  You know that.  There were gunshots, that is true, but the battles were taking place using bladed weapons on both sides.  One did not -- they did not need rifles to do what they did, which I deeply regret with you.  

So do not tell me that because Kayishema is asking for bullets it is probably because he had already distributed the rifles.  If you have the answer where he acknowledged that, I don't think you would refer me to this list here where nothing is said about rifles.  Where are rifles being mentioned in the adjudicated facts you have referred to?  No reference was made to rifles or machine guns in the Kayishema trial.  If you had such evidence, you would have brought it before me.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Can we move on to the next document, if the registrar would kindly provide the witness with P. 53, in evidence.  It's the letter of the 18th of June.  In our bundle it's identified as 04.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Karemera, you were anxious to be able to -- anxious to be given an opportunity to comment on your own document.  Here, we're about to do that.  You've already acknowledged -- 
A.	Yes.  I have the letter, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	That's your signature at the bottom.  You don't -- you acknowledge that it's your letter and that it was sent on the 18th of June 1994, which is the day after the cabinet meeting that was held on the 17th of June.  
A.	Yes.  I acknowledge that, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	And you know as well that Anatole Nsengiyumva acknowledged receiving this letter.  
A.	Yes, I'm aware of that, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	How did you send this letter to him?  
A.	But, as I said when answering Counsel Diagne, I do not quite remember whether -- what I do recall is that I was in Gisenyi and that Anatole Nsengiyumva was in Gisenyi.  So this letter was certainly not sent to him through the mail.  We did not have any operational postal services at the time.  But I do not remember whether I brought the letter to him or whether I gave it to my driver, who went to bring it to him.  I believe that was how it happened.  I must have given the note to the driver, who went to drop it at the military camp.  That was at a distance of less than 1 kilometre from the Méridien hotel, where I would stay when I was in Gisenyi.  So I believe that was how it happened.  
Q.	That sounds reasonable, because he was just right down the road from you.  In fact, the military leaders and the civilian leaders gathered quite frequently right there at the Méridien hotel and next door at the Palm Beach hotel.  Right?
A.	No.  I was at the Méridien hotel, and I also know the Palm Beach hotel.  But, you know, I -- neither I nor Anatole had time to stay on the veranda not doing anything.  It was not the Dolce Vita.  Times were hard, and we had enormous responsibilities, even if that is not your vision of things.  
Q.	You had enormous responsibilities, and you had quite a great deal of access to each other.  That is what I'm suggesting to you, because he was right there in Gisenyi, he was just a stone's -- a stone's throw from the Méridien hotel, which was just a few steps away from the Palm Beach hotel, which is where all of the government dignitaries gathered.  So that's all I'm suggesting to you, and you seem to have agreed with me.  So I'll move on.  So you either had it delivered to him -- 
A.	No, Counsel for the Prosecution.  No.  Why are you taking him from Hôtel Méridien to take him to 
	Palm Beach?  The government officials were all staying at the Méridien hotel because it was a state institution.  The Palm Beach was a private establishment, and the Méridien hotel was classier, so that I don't know why you would want them to go to the Palm Beach hotel.  

The second thing is that Anatole Nsengiyumva had a military camp that was on the road leading to the airport.  So he did not command -- exercise his command from the Palm Beach hotel.  So if you want to say that I met him, it would be either at the Méridien hotel or at his camp, the Gisenyi camp, which faces the hospital.  You know where it is.  I assume that it is still there.  But not at the Palm Beach.  
Q.	You say you don't remember how the letter was dispatched.  I suggest to you that it could also have been dispatched by fax.  Do you disagree?  
A.	Faxed?  Do you mean faxed?  
Q.	I think my question was very clear.  
A.	I told you that I did not remember.  If you have any evidence to that effect, it is possible.  But I thought -- I believe that I must have given it to a driver.  Since it was -- the distance was of less than 1 kilometre, it was faster than a fax.  
Q.	Let's continue.  You entitle your letter "The object", or "The objet" -- I'm reading the French text.  Let me --  the subject is "Sweep operation in Kibuye".  Or in French, "Opération de ratissage à Kibuye". 

You said that Kayishema may not have understood what that word meant or may have used it incorrectly or clumsily.  But here, you are the one who is using this.  So you tell us what you meant.  
A.	Yes.  Counsel for the Prosecution, when you have in your documents "your reference", "our reference", this is administration.  The subject of the letter is the response to a letter to the telegram of Préfet Kayishema, whose subject was this clean-up operation, indeed.  And, in order for the recipient to know what the note I sent was about, I took what seemed to be the focal point of his telegram, and this is why this was the subject of my response.  

And, besides, that response was not mine but, rather, that of the government, the response of the government to his suggestion.  He was the one suggesting the clean-up operation, and we were responding and reacting to his suggestion.  And this is why I used the very words he used.  Otherwise, I did not wish to reinvent the wheel.  
Q.	The letter continues.  "I have the honour to inform you that during the counsel of ministers' meeting this Friday, the 17th of June 1994, the government decided to request the operational secteur commander in Gisenyi, with support of the population, to conduct the cordon and search operation by the" - to the English is actually a bit difficult to read.  But, "To support the gendarmerie -- to support a cordon and search operation by the gendarmerie in Kibuye in the Bisesero area of Gishyita commune, which has become a sanctuary for the RPF." 

Now, my question to you, Mr. Karemera, is, aside from the letter or the telegram from Kayishema on the 12th -- or dated the 12th of June, who else was characterising -- how -- who was characterising Bisesero as a sanctuary of the RPF?  
A.	I did not really understand your question.  Who else?  Do you mean within the government?  Do you mean in the international community?  I don't know.  If that is what you mean, I can refer you to what Ruzibiza wrote.  He listed the areas where -- 
Q.	Mr. Karemera, we're not talking about Ruzibiza and a book that he wrote in 2008.  We're talking about what you knew in June of 1994.  So my question to you is who was referring to Bisesero as a sanctuary of the RPF when you met with the interim government in a cabinet meeting on the 17th of June.  You have a letter from Kayishema, and I want to know if there's any other information that you had at your disposal on the 17th of June that would lead you to describe the problem in Bisesero as their being a sanctuary of the RPF.  
A.	Now I understand your question.  Let me start by confirming that Kayishema was the first one to say so.  Further, during the -- furthermore, during the pacification meeting of the 3rd of May, Kayishema had said so; but also Ndimbati, Charles Sikubwabo had also said that, as well as other speakers who perhaps said it in less clear terms than the two bourgmestres here; and then, Counsel for the Prosecution, Radio Muhabura, which broadcast in Karongi.  If you know that -- Karongi has become the headquarters of the Kibuye district, because the RPF, from the bush, broadcast in the direction of Karongi, which is the highest mount in the region.  And Radio Muhabura had congratulated the bourgmestres of the communes of Gishyita and Rwamatamu, as you know, congratulating them for having sent many fighters from its ranks.  

If you had not refused access to the recordings of Radio Muhabura programmes to us, I would have been able to prove a long time ago to you that Bisesero was, indeed, the area where the RPF supporters in the enemy zone would regroup.  By enemy zone, I mean the governmental zone. 

And even if you don't want to hear that, Ruzibiza did write about it.  He provided a map to describe the areas of concentration of the supporters.  And Bisesero was part -- was one of those areas where they were ready to intervene if Kagame had not given formal orders that any commander of sector who would let his men abandon the major objective, that is to say, the seizing of Kigali and of power, to send them to support the RPF supporters in the different infiltrators' positions, that such a person would see him.  "They will see me.  They will see me," was what Kagame said.  

This was known by everyone, and I'm convinced that you were told that.  But you cannot say that here, because you're not my witness.  You're not a witness in my defence.  You are my Prosecutor.  

So Bisesero was, indeed, an RPF sanctuary.  And this was common knowledge.  Seth Sendashonga comes from there.  He's not a Tutsi.  Assinapol Rwigara is also from that region.  Denis Polisi is also from that region, Kabuye.  Kabuye, not the lady who is prosecuted in France, but Kabuye who was the speaker of the parliament, he comes from there.  And all of these people had recruited in the region, they were there.  That is the RPF sanctuary.  
Q.	My question is very -- 
A.	And so is my answer, counsel for the Prosecution. 
(Pages 21 to 41 by Alannah Murray)





















1230H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	My question to you was very specific.  I believe you answered it around three minutes ago.  The question was:  What information did you have on the 17th of June in that cabinet meeting?  You suggested, aside from Kayishema, it was what was being said on the 3rd of May in the pacification meeting in Kibuye.  That's all you had to say because that's the information I'm looking for.  

But we'll continue with this after lunch, with the Court's permission.  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I also said that Radio Muhabura was broadcasting and was talking about Bisesero, brigade 65.  Don't you know that?  Rugona, aren't you aware of that in spite of the fact that you have the recordings with you?  Rugona, you're aware of that, aren't you?  It is in Bisesero.  And it was on Radio Muhabura that that was being said all the time.  Programmes were on throughout and the RPF supporters -- and I'm talking about the supporters of the RPF and not the Tutsi, because among the people who were in Bisesero there were Tutsis and there were Hutus, and there were even white people, from what I was told, those who found foreign exchange such as the greenbacks from your country.  They assumed that they were Americans, but I'm sure that there weren't any.  They sent the resources and they let people do what they wanted. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, is this a convenient time to break?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We take our luncheon adjournment now.  
(Court recessed at 1231H)

(Court resumed at 1616H) 
MR. HOMETOWU: 
The proceedings are adjourned until tomorrow morning in view of the fact that the accused person on the stand at the moment is unwell.  We have just received a medical report to that effect.  

So proceedings are adjourned until tomorrow morning at 8:45 a.m.  

Thank you.
