P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody.  Madam Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MS. KOUO: 
Yes, Your Honour.  Thank you.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short, and Judge Gustave Kam is now sitting in open session, today, Monday the 30th of October 2006, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, case number ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Madam Registrar.  

The appearances are the same.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Now I can hear you, thank you.  I can hear what -- what is being said now.  Good morning.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Mr. President.  Sorry.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Witness.  And now I greet you again.  
THE WITNESS:
I equally wish you good day, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I remind you that you remain under oath to tell the truth, the oath that you took when your testimony began.  And your cross-examination by Mr. Weyl will now continue.  
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE: 
Mr. President, if it pleases you.  I just wish to acknowledge receipt of the list of exhibits from my learned friend, Mr. Weyl, who has succeeded in pulling me into the one-legged race, albeit on the opposite leg.  So in those circumstances I will, from time to time, rely on Mr. Webster's input in that regard.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, thank you for inviting me to pursue my cross.

CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued) 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, good morning.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	I would remind you of our resolutions to have a moderate rhythm in the interests of the people following the debate; the interpreters, and above all, the court reporters.  

Witness, when we broke on Friday we were saying that we'd go through your preceding statements, both to the Rwandan authorities and those of the ICTR.  Do you remember that?  
A.	It would be a good thing if you had the statements handy, as it would help me refresh my memory.  
Q.	You were heard for the first time in Rwanda in ***********************************1998; is that correct? 
A.	No, Counsel, that is incorrect. 
Q.	Well, if that isn't correct, could you correct me?  
A.	If you say -- are saying that it was indeed the **** that I was questioned by the prosecutor in the public prosecutor's office -- but before that I told you that I was arrested on the *************when I was summoned.  I received a summons to which I responded.  The judicial police inspector of ************commune questioned me on that occasion, and then subsequently on the*************, that's when I was transferred to Kigali central prison.  
Q.	Is that to say that on the *********************1998 you signed a statement? 
A.	That is correct. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, perhaps we could ask the Prosecutor, in the context of the best efforts they make, to disclose that they tried to obtain this statement of the *************1998, which is not among the matters so far disclosed to us.  
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE: 
In that regard, Mr. President, we have asked for everything from Rwanda, and what we have got is what we have disclosed to my learned friends.  
MR. WEYL: 
That is why, Mr. President, that I'm asking the Prosecution to make further efforts to perfect their efforts, since we have now heard there was a statement dated the ***************1998, and we very much wish to have that disclosed to us.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, in any case on the ***** I was questioned.  I signed a record of what I'd said, but I should like to emphasise that it was on the ***** that I was detained at the central prison.  The state prosecutor questioned me, and I know that the judicial -- communal judicial police inspector reported to the state prosecutor.  And, indeed, the questions put to me on the ***** were practically the same as those put to me on the ************1998.  It was a repetition of the questions that provoked the same responses as those of the ************1998.  You can therefore rely on the statement of the ****************1998 in putting your questions to me.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, am I to understand that in your statement of ************1998, you did not utter the name of Mathieu Ngirumpatse?  
A.	Well, Counsel, whether it was the ****************or even the***********, and if my memory serves me right, nobody put any questions to me concerning Mathieu Ngirumpatse or Nzirorera -- nor Nzirorera, nor Karemera.  They were focused on my own personal file.  So the prosecutor was not aiming at those people, thinking about those people in putting his questions to me.  
Q.	I have understood that those questions were not put to you, but neither on the ************1998, nor on the ************************************************************1998, did you consider it necessary to explain your actions by incriminating Ngirumpatse, Karemera, or Nzirorera as you are doing at present?  
A.	Counsel, I will repeat the same thing:  If I had been put questions specifically pertaining to those gentlemen, I would have answered the question.  But at that time they wanted to know about the crimes I myself was alleged to have committed, even if the authorities aren't named.  If you read my responses, you will understand that they were to some extent, one way or the other, concerned.  
Q.	Witness, the -- you were notified, at that point of the charges, the allegations against you.  
A.	They were questioning me.  There was no notification.  They were questioning me.  
Q.	And at no point were you informed of what the acts you were called to answer for? 
A.	When one is arrested, there must, in any case, be a motive, and questions are put to you regarding allegations against you.  Questions are put to you and sooner or later they specify that of which you are accused.  
Q.	Do you remember the allegations against you in ****1998? 
A.	I don't know where you're going, Counsel.  You told me that you had those documents in hand.  I consider that it would be better to read those documents if it's not a problem concerning your client. 
Q.	Witness, I should like to come back to the matter of methodology.  Do not be concerned with where I am heading; be content with answering the questions I put to you.  That's the only thing one can expect of you, that you answer the questions.  So I'm asking you:  Did you know the allegations against you in *****1998?  
A.	I do remember, Counsel.  
Q.	On Thursday you stated before this Trial Chamber, you said that there was an allegation of genocide.  Was it only that allegation, or was there more than that that led to your being questioned as an offender in 1998?  
A.	Counsel, I remember that when I was being questioned, I was -- it was made clear to me that this was the very first time.  I was being questioned as to the allegations against me, so there are no other charges that I was informed of.  
Q.	Witness, I have before me an extract of your file from Rwanda, which is more or less a summary of what your statements were prior to your being heard.  And I see that among the charges there's genocide, crimes against humanity, complicity in murder, association -- connivance with wrongdoers, violation of article 258 of the penal code in threatening public order and safety and, finally, rape.  Were those -- were you informed of those charges?  Were you aware of them?  
A.	But, Mr. President, Counsel, I am surprised that he's digging through my personal file, whereas I'm here as a Prosecution witness against people.  I don't see from where he obtains all this information.  As far as I know, that is written in none of the documents of which I have knowledge, personal knowledge.  
Q.	To reassure you, Witness, and to reassure the Trial Chamber, these documents are extracted from what was disclosed by the Prosecution, and the document I just mentioned is K0109996 to K0110000, and which is a summary record prior to proceedings against Witness ALG and dated ************1996.  

We were speaking of your questioning in 1998.  So that was the second time you were heard?  
A.	Mr. President, Counsel, and counsel for the Prosecution, this is the very first time I have heard what you read out -- I mean this document of the ***********1996.  This is the first time I've heard of it, absolutely the first time.  I never heard of it at all from the Rwandan authorities.  I agree with you that on the *****************1998 I was questioned, and on the basis of the record kept of that interview -- as to the rest of it, what you have read dated the ***************1996 is the very first time I hear of it.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I don't wish to begin a discussion with the witness on this, but I feel a certain amount of surprise that the Prosecution did not go through with the witness the documents that were disclosed to us as being part of the record, and which, of course, lead to questions on the credibility of the witness and his personal history.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, on the ************1998, you were asked where you were during the genocide.  What did you then answer?  
A.	I answered that question, and even here the question was put to me, and I gave the same answer on both occasions.  
Q.	I would have liked you to remind me of your answer, or do you want me to remind you of it myself?  
A.	Counsel, you know the answer.  What are you looking for?  You want to slow things down?  I don't know.  
Q.	Witness, you answered -- I will not give the name of the place so as not to -- because of the -- you said you were at home from the 7th to the 10th of April 1994.  7th to 10th of April 1994.  Do you remember that?  
A.	Now I understand where -- what you are looking for, where you want to go.  I remember that on Friday you put a question to me along those lines.  Whether it be here in this courtroom, or elsewhere, wherever I have given testimony, I have asked that that error be corrected.  It was the 12th.  I think there are documents that reveal that correction, reflect that correction.  I think even the state prosecutor had that correction.  
Q.	Witness, I am not yet at the stage of corrections, I am at the stage of your responses four years after the fact.  In 1998 you did say that you stayed home from the 7th to the 10th of April 1994.  That was your memory of the events in 1998; do we agree on that?  
A.	Counsel, I have already answered that question.  
Q.	Witness, you provided a second statement on the *************1998.  Again -- you again said that had you stayed at home until the 10th of April 1998; twice on the same day you committed the same mistake.  
A.	Counsel, you're treading water.  You put the question to me and I answered you.  After the******, you can go to the other statements I made.  If I made a mistake on that day and subsequently realised that I had made a mistake, well, I corrected it.  But subsequently I realised that there was a mistake and I made a correction. 
Q.	At no time during your testimony on the *************1998 did you correct the absence of the mention of Ngirumpatse in your testimony?  
A.	Counsel, since you have the document you can refresh my memory.  I don't know if I mentioned him on those occasions, but if I did, well, then you can remind me.  I don't remember the content of those statements. 
Q.	Witness, I don't think I need to take up the Court's time at this point in reading your entire testimony of the *************1998.  I assert, and the Court will see in the documents submitted, that at no time is the name of Mathieu Ngirumpatse mentioned in your statements, and you have no recollection that could contradict me on that point.  
A.	I think I have already expressed myself on that point, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness, you were heard on the ******************1999 before the (French spoken), and you did not mention Ngirumpatse's name on that occasion.  
A.	If, Counsel, you are going to proceed in this way -- if you think that when I appeared before the (French spoken) you should recite all the names, that is not the case.  To make the task easier for everyone, I can tell you that I mentioned no names.  I mentioned no one.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Excuse me.  Your Honours, I think it would be preferable in the cross-examination if Mr. Weyl actually confronts the witness with his previous statements if there are inconsistencies.  Because when I look at this statement from the last statement that he mentioned, it has a single question and an answer.  And the question did not raise any issue of any of these accused.  It's inappropriate for him to question him on the basis of that statement for the point that he's trying to make.  

And things would be much more direct if Mr. Weyl simply places the statement that the witness actually made, along with the question, before him, or reads it into the record, because this is not an appropriate way to conduct a cross-examination along these lines.
  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I think it would be fair -- it is fair, in fact, to ask the witness whether he remembers having mentioned a name during a questioning session, and to confirm to me that he did not mention any of those names.  And the Chamber can verify that.  However, if the Trial Chamber wants us to read out the entirety of the statement, I do not know whether that's going to be very conducive in terms of time, and timeliness.  However, I shall defer to you, Mr. President, as to the method you wish to use.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yeah, at that stage I don't think it's necessary to read out the statement -- at this stage.  
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, just as a matter of explanation -- Mr. Witness, this is the Judge speaking to you.  As a matter of explanation, in our proceedings, counsel is authorised to find out whether the statements that you have made previously are inconsistent, that is, different to what you are saying in court.  So he is permitted to make enquiries of you along these lines.  You understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
I understand, Mr. President.  However -- 
MR. WEYL: 
(No interpretation)
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I can see that he's trying to interrupt me.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, we can't hear him, unfortunately.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, I'm hearing you now.  You may continue.  
THE WITNESS:
I would like him to make a distinction between the different statements, because it seems to me that he is saying that there are contradictions in the different statements that I gave.  Now, there is a category of document referred to as -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, Mr. Witness -- 
THE WITNESS:
-- summary -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
-- I think it would be better for you and everybody if you just answer the questions.  Up to now there has been no allegation of a contradiction.  He has asked you if you have mentioned a particular name before, and your answer up to now has been no.  That is all that he has asked up to now.  So it would be better just to wait on his questions and answer them.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, I'm very sorry that you came under the impression earlier that I was actually interrupting you.  I did not know that you had anything further to say because I couldn't hear any sound through my headset, and I thought you had finished.  So if, again, in the future, I interrupt you, it will be, you should know, totally involuntary.  

Now, on the **********************1999, you were questioned and I confirmed that you did not mention Mr. Ngirumpatse, Mr. Nzirorera, or Mr. Karemera.  Do you feel that you need to contradict me on that point?  
A.	Counsel, if those names appear nowhere in the statements, that means that I did not utter those names, because no questions on the subject of those gentlemen were put to me.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you were heard on the ********************of the year 2000, and a question was put to   you -- you were asked to talk about your work between the period of April to July 1994, and you responded by saying:  "When the killings commenced, I was living in" -- a certain place -- "and on the 11th of April 1994, I went to the préfectoral office where I met the other employees."  So you said "on the 11th of April 1994", did you not?  
A.	It is possible that I came to state that.  But as I said to you, one can be wrong.  Anybody can make a mistake, and afterwards I asked for that detail to be rectified.  Counsel, I would like, therefore, to come back to the date that I stated.  When the prosecutor was questioning me, I did give the true date that I went to the préfectoral office at that time. 
Q.	But you will confirm that on two occasions in the year 1998, and also in the year 2000, you gave the same answer with reference to the same dates, and you made the same mistake at an interval of two years, and only then rectified, or amended, or corrected your memory two years later?  
A.	I gave you my reasons, the reasons that asked -- that led me to ask for it to be amended.  It is, of course, normal that one can make a mistake.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, this brings us back to the question that I put to you on Friday morning as to the quality of memory, and recollections that are no more or less authentic ten years after than they were four years after the fact.  You were -- you appeared on the *************2000, and if I say to you that you did not utter the name of Mr. Ngirumpatse, Mr. Nzirorera, or Mr. Karemera, would you deny that fact?  
A.	Counsel, if in the document that you have before you their names do not appear, that means that I did not mention their names, and that no questions were put to me on their -- on the subject of those people.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, were you questioned on other occasions by the Rwandan authorities after that questioning of the *********************of the year 2000?  
A.	I don't quite understand which authorities you are referring to.  Maybe you could enlighten me on that point.  But it is true to say that the judicial authorities questioned me on the subject of my judicial record.  With reference to the dates, well, you seem to be harping on about dates, and one can very easily forget a date.  It is not easy to remember dates, in view of what we lived through.  Sometimes you can remember facts or events that happened, but forget the date at which they occurred.  And you have to remember that, especially for we Rwandans -- because I know that erudite people concentrate on dates, but I know that in our Rwandan culture, we concentrate more on events than dates, because we do not keep a diary as other cultures would.  Sometimes you can remember events or an unhappy event, but you easily forget the date at which it occurred.  So, Mr. President, I would like you to understand that point.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, my specific question was whether you were questioned on other subsequent occasions by the judicial authorities of your country after the final hearing that I have, which is of the **************of the year 2000, that is now nearly seven years ago.  Were you actually questioned by investigating judges, by representatives of the public prosecution, by policemen? 
A.	I don't really remember, Counsel.  But as to the subject of your clients, I would like to say that the Rwandan judicial authorities did not put any questions to me on the subject of those people.  It is only the representatives or the investigators of the ICTR that put questions to me on the subject of those people.  The judicial authorities in Rwanda more specifically put questions to me on the subject of my judicial record, and asked me to defend myself.  I might have taken down notes in which I mentioned their names. 
Q.	Well, what concerns me, Witness, is that in order to ask you to testify, put questions to you, and also appreciate the bearing of your statements, I have to put these questions to you.  Now, with reference to your judicial record in Rwanda, what I have here in a Prosecution document was the fact that this document was transmitted to the public prosecutor's office on the 20th of July 2000, and since that date, it would seem that the file no longer has any elements added to it, or maybe they were not disclosed to us.  What I want to know is whether you were questioned, whether you appeared before judges?  Could you please enlighten me on this point? 
A.	Counsel, with reference to my judicial record, I do not have it before me; you do.  And what is more, if the Rwandan authorities sent my file, or record, to the Prosecutor, then the Prosecutor -- well, it's the very same judicial record, so the questions that he put to me are relevant to that record.  So the Rwandan authorities could not send any other record other than that that already existed.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, I suppose -- I presume that you have an answer to the question that I've put to you, and I suppose that we could enlighten the Chamber.  Now, between the month of *********2000, have you appeared once, twice, three times, or more than three times, fewer than ten times before an investigating judge in Rwanda?  And if you do have an answer to that question, please give it to the Trial Chamber.  
A.	I do not remember, Counsel, but I would like you to refer to the judicial record that you have in your possession in order to check.  If you were not given a document after the date of ********2000, that is that such a document does not exist.  And you have just used a term that pleases me.  Before you used the word "document", and now you have just specified that it was in fact a questioning session.  Now you're using the word "questioning".  
Q.	I shall specify my question, because it could be a problem of terminology.  I am talking about an investigating judge; it might not be the correct term to use.  Now, since the month of ********2000, have you appeared, at least on one occasion, before a magistrate or a representative of the public prosecutor's office in Rwanda, or a deputy prosecutor?  Do you remember having appeared at least once, or having been heard at least once?  
A.	Counsel, I don't really remember. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I think that we shall have to content ourselves with this response.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	So, Witness, you do not remember having had dealings with the judicial authorities of your country for the last six-and-a-half years; is that correct? 
A.	That's what you just said, Counsel.  That is what you conclude.  But I have just told you that I do not remember.  
Q.	Witness, you were taken into provisional custody when you were arrested, were you not?  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	How long did you stay in custody, or remain in custody? 
A.	Until the month of ********2005. 
Q.	And what happened in *******2005?  
A.	I went to the solidarity camp, as did many other prisoners who had just been released, and we took part in the activities of that solidarity camp. 
Q.	You tell me that you were released, so there was a decision, presumably, on the part of a magistrate or a court that gave rise to your provisional release? 
A.	Yes, a decision was handed down. 
Q.	And did you come to learn of that decision? 
A.	Yes, I did.  That decision was handed to me. 
Q.	And did you talk about this decision to Mr. Prosecutor? 
A.	Yes, the Prosecutor is aware of that decision, too.  
Q.	Did the Prosecutor ask you for a copy of said decision?  
A.	Yes, he did, and I gave him a photocopy of that decision.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, could we possibly ask the Prosecutor to improve his efforts to disclose the elements that he has in his possession, because I do not believe that that document is amongst the material disclosed to us.  
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE: 
I'm not sure if I understand, Mr. President, the terminology "decision", because what the Prosecutor got and what the Prosecutor disclosed was a provisional warrant of release.  That is all I can assist my friend with at this time.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, unless I am grossly mismanaging the file, could the reference, the disclosure reference of that "decision", in inverted commas, be disclosed to me, or be given to me?  
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE: 
Mr. President, perhaps my learned friend could invite the witness to elaborate on what he's referring to as a decision.  I'm not sure if he's speaking of a judgment of some sort, or if it is the same provisional warrant.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, it would seem that the basis for my question has been given by the witness himself.  I asked him whether he had received a decision, whether it was disclosed to him.  He said that he received a copy of the decision.  I asked him whether he had informed the Prosecution of the existence of that decision, and without having verified the transcripts, I seem to recall that he said that he did give a copy of that decision to the Prosecutor.  Now, could that document please be disclosed to me, because I believe that it has not been?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes --  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, has just come to my aid.  It would seem to me that there was a disclosure of the 16th of June 2006 that I might have missed.  It is only, however, in Kinyarwanda, and maybe the translation of said document could be disclosed to us.  
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE: 
We do not have a translation of that document at this time, Mr. President.  Perhaps, if it will speed the process along, my learned friend could refer the document to the witness who speaks Kinyarwanda and he could assist him.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I would first like to avail myself of the contents of the document without filtering it through the witness.  So if I do have questions to put to the witness on that subject subsequently, I will do so after the pause.  But I would first like to discuss the contents of the said document with my client, with your leave, Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Now, Witness, since this decision of the month of ******2005, have any other judicial decisions been notified to you?  
A.	After that date of ******2005, some documents on my provisional release were given to me, but none on an official basis.  
Q.	Witness, you will be appearing shortly before a court, and you have received no notification of what you will have to answer to in terms of allegations before that tribunal, have you?  
A.	Yes, I am informed of the allegations against me.  I have been informed.  
Q.	And was a document given to you, specifying what allegations you will have to answer to before the court? 
A.	I have just answered that question, Counsel.  
Q.	So a document was given to you; is that correct? 
A.	I just told you that a document was given to me airing the allegations against me.  
Q.	Was that document disclosed to Mr. Prosecutor? 
A.	I do not know whether that is necessary, that is, to disclose the document to the Prosecution.  But if he wants that document, then he can ask the court for it. 
MR. WEYL:
Could I put the question to the Prosecutor, that is, to improve the disclosure element on that point.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, it might be better if you made a compendious request at a later stage, than to make these enquiries continuously throughout this examination.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, it seemed to me -- but, yes, maybe I will produce an inventory on the elements, the lacking elements.  But it would seem to me that all the elements relevant to the judicial record of the witness should be disclosed without us having to request that one by one.  And I did file a motion on that subject, and I am under the impression now that the Rwandan judicial record is very incomplete.  

Now, this last mention of a decision, and the fact that the witness will be appearing before a court in the weeks to come, underlines the incomplete nature of the disclosures that we have received which could, ultimately, make it difficult for the witness to answer to any allegations before a court after having made such a statement before our Trial Chamber.  However, I might renew our request for complete disclosure of the elements that seem to me to be essential in ascertaining the credibility of the witness.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the witness seems to want to say something to you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, thank you.  

Mr. Weyl, one moment, please.  

Mr. Witness, you wish to say something to me?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I should like perhaps to express myself on the topic of the document conveying the allegations against me, in order to avoid any confusion.  I told you that I was informed of the charges against me, but if the counsel has the file, he should check very carefully.  Even if he was given the file this year, it does date from 2000.  In fact, all that was prepared in 2000.  So it was in the year 2000 this judicial record was prepared, even if it was only disclosed in 2006.  But you'll see that the list of allegations was drawn up in the year 2000.  
MR. WEYL: 
(No interpretation) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just one moment, Mr. Weyl.  

Madam Prosecutor, do you have a quick answer to counsel's enquiry?  
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE: 
Mr. President, speaking from my personal knowledge, the Prosecution has disclosed all material that it has in its possession in relation to this witness.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, I listened with great interest to what you just said.  You are to appear before the tribunal on a decision which dates from the year 2000; is that what you're telling us? 
A.	If my memory serves me right, I think that (unintelligible) to this document containing the allegations against me, the date it bears, even if I can't say when it was exactly.  It was in the year 2000; it dates from the year 2000.  If I could have sought out this document -- if I could see this document, it might be useful.  But I think maybe you have it in the file.  It is quite possible that you have it.  
Q.	You're quite right, Witness.  I didn't think that it was that document on the basis of which you would appear before the tribunal.  (Unintelligible) judicial record signed by an official from the public prosecutor's office, dated 22nd of July 2000.  The allegations at that -- the charges at that -- at that time levelled against you, and you say it's the same charges levelled against you in 2006 -- charges proffered against you?  
A.	Yes, we will be basing ourselves on the same document, Counsel.  
MR. WEYL: 
Well, indeed, Mr. President, I have here under K0342888 and 342889.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
If counsel could go slowly, please, with these figures.  
BY MR. WEYL: 
Q.	That is -- in the French -- I don't know what it is in the Kinyarwanda.  It says that the charges proffered against you in *******2006 and still today are first of all of having committed the crime of genocide and crimes against humanity, as described in the convention of the 9th of December '48.  That is the first charge against you.  Do we agree on that?  
A.	I don't remember exactly, but it sounds familiar.  I think it must be that document. 
Q.	If you prefer -- prepare your defence as well as you prepared your testimony before this Trial Chamber, I suppose you must remember perfectly the document that you felt had to be called -- that yourself felt had to be called to my attention.  The first charge against you is that.  The second charge which I see here is having organised and implemented the genocide.  Do you remember that?  
A.	Counsel, I'm accused with other people.  I have co-accused.  You told me that that document is dated the year 2000, but after that time, I myself drafted a document explaining myself in relation to the charges.  I have an -- to date, written documents explaining myself, but I have not had the opportunity to speak in public.  But I would remind you that I'm accused along with other people.  
Q.	That is correct, Witness.  But the third charge proffered against you is that, as perpetrator, co-perpetrator, or accomplice, committed acts of criminal participation in murder with intention of destroying the Tutsi ethnic group.  Do we agree?  
A.	That allegation, or charge, is there.  I don't deny it. 
Q.	The fourth charge is having, as perpetrator, co-perpetrator, or accomplice, been part of an association of wrongdoers, whose common purpose was to exterminate the Tutsi ethnic group.  Is that not correct?  
A.	Yes, yes, yes, it's correct.  I confirm that those are the charges levelled against me.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
(Microphones overlapping)... problems locating the document that Mr. Weyl is referring to.  Could we take one minute and clarify that for the record?  Because I have all the documents here, but I still can't find the one that he's reading from.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I'd given the K number in French.  I'm looking now in my computer for the K numbers in English.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I have that information.  It's K0344765. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
It's a document entitled "case file" and the Prosecutor had previously indicated that it was undated, but in fact there is a date on it of July 2000.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I think the witness wants to speak.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  

Mr. Webster, are you ready now?  Have you got it?  Yeah, thank you.  

Yes, Mr. Witness, you wanted to raise my attention -- you wanted to attract my attention?  Was there something you wished to say?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I'd already put a question regarding that case file, and I'd asked counsel whether that document mentioned the other co-accused.  I did not get an answer, because the document that I know names other people as accused of the same offences.  There's at least three other names.  I should like it to be confirmed that we are speaking of the same document.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	I confirm, Witness, that the document mentions other people, several other people, but does not distinguish, as far as you're concerned, since the charges against you are the ones I am enumerating.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Perhaps we could simplify matters by just providing the witness with the copy of the document.  It exists in Kinyarwanda.  Can Mr. Weyl simply give him the document so we can all refer to the same thing at the same time?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I don't have among my papers the Kinyarwanda version, for the time being.  Maybe we could come back to that after the break.  I'll have the page in Kinyarwanda printed out for the benefit of the witness.  Perhaps after the midday break I can come back to that, with the Court's approval.  

Counsel Robinson has the document in Kinyarwanda.  Perhaps an officer from the registry could assist us by showing it to the witness. 

I seize the opportunity, while you're being shown the document, to remind the witness that he is the beneficiary of protection, and perhaps regarding the names of the other people concerned, I should like him to be careful to realise that he is protected and that he should not reveal names that might lead to revealing his own identity.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, you have the document before you?  
A.	Yes, I have the document before me and I do indeed recognise it.  
Q.	This document is therefore the instrument seizing the Court before which you are shortly to appear; is that correct? 
A.	It is indeed, Counsel.  
Q.	It includes a paragraph in which the identity of the accused is enumerated; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	There are four accused; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	You see your name among the four accused? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And then there's a third paragraph which was true in ******2000, but is less true today, that all detainees are being detained for genocide except for one.  
A.	That is correct.  I think that I explained that I was speaking the truth.  This document is dated the year 2000, and at the time I was in detention.  
Q.	Witness, there's a fourth main paragraph listing the charges against the accused and the list includes seven charges; is that correct? 
A.	That is quite correct.  That is what appears here in this document.  
Q.	The seven charges are proffered without distinction against the four accused; is that correct? 
A.	That is what appears here in this document. 
Q.	You respond individually, therefore, to the seven charges listed in the document, therefore?  
A.	That was not terribly clear, as far as I'm concerned, because it is quite possible that all the charges were put together in the same document, whereas one or another accused might have committed one act or another, but on several occasions they say that the four people perpetrated these acts in concert, because if that was not the case, the four people wouldn't be tried jointly.  But that doesn't mean that they committed all those offences together. 
Q.	Witness, remember the first thing I said when we meant (sic), my attachment to the presumption of innocence, so do not put words in my mouth.  The question I'm putting to you is whether in a few weeks you will have to defend yourself on one count, two counts, or the seven counts listed in this document?  
A.	I confirm that, Counsel.  I will repeat:  What I have already stated at the outset of my testimony, I told you that I went through the procedure of guilty plea, confession, and even begging forgiveness.  So I have admitted certain charges.  There is a document that the Prosecutor has that I drafted along those lines.  
Q.	Witness, none of the seven charges in this document has been dropped, for the time being? 
A.	Mr. President, Counsel, whatever the situation, I should like to tell you the following:  I told you that after the date on that document, I drafted many documents.  As I haven't yet appeared before a court, I cannot tell you whether one or other of the charges has been removed, because I don't know it yet.  
Q.	So we agree, Witness, that at the moment when you are testifying before the Trial Chamber, you have no idea as to what fate awaits you at the trial that is to begin shortly, (unintelligible) a few weeks, and that might have an in -- that might influence your testimony, your statements? 
A.	I am before the international Tribunal.  I am testifying.  Whatever is in that case file, you are the one who wanted to talk about the case file, as far as I know.  But as far as I know, I am testifying without an eye as to what will happen to me, as to what would be the result of the forthcoming trial.  
Q.	So we shall come back to the questions in the order I wish to put to you.  There are seven charges you will be called upon to answer to before a court; is that correct?  Do we agree on that?  
A.	I have already answered that question. 
Q.	The first charge is the crime of genocide and crimes against humanity, and you said yes.  Agreed -- you agreed also to the second charge.  You acquiesced also to the third charge, which was perpetrator, co-perpetrator, or accomplice, committed acts of criminal participation in a murder to destroy the Tutsi ethnic group.  This is an accusation which is in the instrument that will be used by the Trial Chamber.  
A.	Mr. President, in respect of these questions that counsel is putting, I wonder whether I came here -- I would like to ask whether I came here to testify in the Karemera, Ngirumpatse, and Nzirorera trial, or whether it's my own trial.  I should like to be explained what is happening to me now.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Counsel is permitted to ask these questions, so that the -- the status of your judicial record in Rwanda could be explained to the Trial Chamber.  So the purpose of these questions is to inform us of your status in Rwanda.  And that is a fact that will assist us in assessing the -- your evidence.  So that's the purpose of it.  
THE WITNESS:
I have understood, Mr. President, but you will have noted that he is listing the charges one after the other.  Well, if he really wants to go on like that, and if he's going to enumerate all the documents that I drafted, I don't think we'll ever get to the end of it.  Because if he's analysing the charges one after the other, he'll have to also refer to all the documents I myself drafted.  Because in those documents I admitted certain things, and all those documents have to be analysed in detail, and I think that would take too long.  At least, that's how I see things.  I think that the public prosecutor has examined my case file and certain charges perhaps have been dropped.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, please don't encourage Mr. Weyl to go beyond what he originally intended to do.  

We will be trying to -- we would not like you to be too repetitious, Mr. Weyl, and you are just about to enter into that realm, I suspect.  
MR. WEYL: 
Let me reassure you, forthwith, Mr. President, my questions call for simple answers, not for comments which are the proper task of the Rwandan courts.  My task is to determine the witness's present situation and what are the charges, justified or not, that are proffered against him.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, the fourth charge proffered against you is that as perpetrator, co-perpetrator, or accomplice, you were part of an association of wrongdoers.  
A.	Yes, that charge is there.  
(Pages 1 to 16 by Kirstin McLean)



1030H 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, the fifth charge levelled against you, which is hanging over your head, is that of having as perpetrator, co-perpetrator or accomplice, committed acts, the purpose of which was devastation and massacre; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that charge is also there. 
Q.	The sixth accusation dangling over your head is having as perpetrator, co-perpetrator or accomplice, destroying buildings belonging to others; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Witness, the seventh charge hanging over your head is having, under the same circumstances of time and place as perpetrator, co-perpetrator or accomplice, you violated other people's residences, looking for either people to kill or property to loot; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is written as you have said it; that is what is written (unintelligible) in the Kinyarwanda. 
Q.	Witness, it is the 30th of October, year of our Lord 2006.  In a few weeks you will be appearing before a court in Rwanda.  And you don't know whether these charges or any single one of them might be withdrawn from the accusations that are hanging over your head; is that correct? 
A.	I think you have answered the question yourself. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, perhaps the time has come to make the mid-morning break. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it is 10:30.  We will take a mid-morning recess now for approximately 15 minutes. 
(Court recessed from 1030H to 1104H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may continue, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, coming back to you, and now I would like to go to your statement or statements before this Tribunal.  When were you interviewed for the first time by ICTR investigators? 
A.	I don't recall very well the date.  But I know they questioned me on several occasions. 
Q.	At the outset you provided a written statement, or it was merely a verbal -- oral statement and the investigators took notes? 
A.	I don't remember very well whether they took any notes.  But in any case, each time they came they had papers in their hands; they had paper. 
Q.	The first written statement I have in the file is a statement in respect of questioning on the                   *************************************************2002; do you remember that? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	The first words of your statement I shall read to you.  You say:  "This is the third or fourth time that I meet ICTR investigators."  Is that correct? 
A.	It is possible that is what I said. 
Q.	So, the two or three preceding occasions you didn't say anything of sufficient interest to the investigators for them to take any notes or record it in any way; is that correct? 
A.	I don't think you should put that question to me.  Maybe you should put it to the investigators concerned.
Q.	Witness, do you remember who was present at those interviews? 
A.	On which occasion -- which occasions are you referring to, what date?  
Q.	Counsel, I'm speaking of *****************************************************************************2002, since those were three statements consolidated in a single written document that you signed in 2003.  So, do you remember the statements of the ********************************2002?  And do you remember who was present at those interviews? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter missed the date of signing. 
THE WITNESS:
I remember a few names.  There was one Lanciné, one Stassin, Madam Dior Fall.  I also remember Don Webster. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, when you told me one Don Webster was present at your questioning, would it be someone who is present in this courtroom? 
A.	Counsel, it is the Prosecutor.  I see him here. 
MR. WEYL:
Don't worry, Mr. Prosecutor, I will not do him the affront of asking him to be recognised before everyone.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, you have said that your answers might be determined by the questions put to you, and the capacity of your questioners to stimulate your recollection; is that correct? 
A.	I think I have answered that question, Counsel. 
Q.	The **********************************************************2002, you did not mention the name of Ngirumpatse, nor Nzirorera, nor Karemera; is that correct? 
A.	I don't remember very well, but it is possible that I did not mention their names. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I can, perhaps, assist Mr. Weyl with the line of his questioning because I can state that this interview was part of an Renhazo -- an investigation into Tharcisse Renzaho.  And I don't recall asking this witness any questions about any of the Accused on this case.  So, on that matter, it should be clear.  

MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I object to that.  That it is really not proper for Mr. Webster to be testifying at this point.  If he wants to join the witness in the box and be cross-examined, he can do so.  But I think it is improper for him to make that intervention.  I'd ask that it be stricken from the record.  He is not a witness to be doing that. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, Mr. Robinson -- Counsel Robinson took the words out of my mouth.  I thought it was incongruous that the Prosecutor should answer in the witness's stead questions to come.  But it doesn't disturb me that that intrusion into the witness's testimony be retained on the record.  So, I do not wish it to be struck.  I should like the witness to confirm that it was, indeed, in **********2002. 
THE WITNESS:
	I think that you have said that yourself. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	So, this was eight years after the events? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	Four years after the arrest of Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	As to the date on which he was arrested, I cannot tell you, I don't remember. 
Q.	I will remind you that Mr. Ngirumpatse is detained since July 1998, and an indictment was already prepared against him, an indictment has already been prepared against him when no questions were put to you as to any testimony or case that might -- you might contribute to against him.  So you were in 2002, and you had -- a questioner was putting the right questions to you.  And you answered that you stayed at home from the 6th of April to the 11th of April 1994.  And on the 11th of April 1994, you went to the préfecture to meet the préfet, Renzaho.  That was on the 11th of April; is that correct? 
A.	Counsel, I think I have answered that question on several occasions.  It is possible.  It is possible I mentioned that date. 
Q.	In 2002, you had not yet seen the interests that would be in rectifying a possible mistake in the dates.  You still were coherent with what you had stated in 1998, and in 2000.  We agree on that, do we? 
A.	Counsel, I have told you that in our Rwandan culture, it is not usual to remember dates as to periods and dates.  One only gives approximations. 
Q.	So, in your Rwandan culture, it is relevant, pertinent, coherent to rectify dates that were of no interest, therefore; is that correct? 
A.	Counsel, I should like you to correct something.  You used this word "interest", it is a word I do not like.  I should like to say that when one remembers events and exact dates when asked for a rectification, one might be mistaken.  Even writers, researchers can be mistaken.  And later, they establish a corrigendum or errata to correct the mistakes that might have been made. 
Q.	Were the errata or corrigendum established to take account of the discussions you might have had held with Mr. Karekezi? 
A.	And which Karekezi are you referring to, Counsel?  I don't see where you are drawing that name from.  Many people are named Karekezi.  I know five, if not more than ten. 
Q.	Well, being very careful with regard to your protection, Witness, I was speaking of the possibility of having discussed your schedule in April 1994 with Mr. Amri Karekezi? 
A.	Now I see.  I know Amri Karekezi, and we did talk, of course.  But the problem is you speak of the date, and immediately you mention the name of Amri Karekezi.  I do not recognise the connection. 
Q.	Witness, I was asking you whether the -- correction, you brought the narrative of your schedule was in respect of discussions and adjustments to your schedule that you might have made with                 Mr. Amri Karekezi? 
A.	No, that is not the reason. 
Q.	But, you did talk with Mr. Amri Karekezi.
MR. WEYL:
Maybe I should spell that, K-A-R-E-K-E-Z-I.  And Counsel presents his apologies to the court reporters.  
THE WITNESS:
What period are you referring to, Counsel?  I know Amri Karekezi, and we talked about that on several occasions. 
BY MR. WEYL:  
Q.	Did you discuss the events with Mr. Amri Karekezi after your first testimony to the Rwandan authorities in 1998? 
A.	Yes, we would talk on several occasions.  We have known each other for a very long time.  ************ *******************************************************Of course, we would talk, of course. 
Q.	Did you discuss your testimony to the investigators? 
A.	Never, not once. 
Q.	Would he sometimes relate events to you on which you subsequently gave testimony in your statements to the investigators? 
A.	I should like to be quite -- to be thoroughly understood.  I would talk with Karekezi, but they came -- people came to investigate, I don't know whether they also spoke to Karekezi.  I don't know whether they contacted him as they had contacted me.  They would put questions to you like you are putting them to me.  The investigators have their technique.  Perhaps, when they put questions to me, I might have mentioned that it was Karekezi who had provided me with one item of information or another. 
Q.	Did Amri Karekezi speak to you of what happened in Kigali at the time when you stayed home between the 6th of April 1994, and a point in time which -- I don't know -- was the 11th or the 12th -- I don't know yet, whether it was the 11th or the 12th of April 1994?
A.	(By order of the court, this portion of the evidence was extracted and filed under seal).  He related to me what happened.  He informed me as to the situation that prevailed, and more particularly the situation that prevailed in his secteur. 

MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I'm trying to be very cautious.  I wish that the witness would also be cautious.  And, therefore, that we strike the reference to Karekezi's functions, official functions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The redaction is ordered. 
MR. WEYL: 
I would ask the witness to bear in mind that he is a protected witness, and (unintelligible) -- that that was his wish.  He should, therefore, be careful in his answers to me so that he might not be identified from his own answers. 
BY MR. WEYL: 
Q.	I shall return in due course to what you stated about the events from 19 -- from April 1994 to July 1994.  But if I tell you that in 2002, the point of your questioning was especially to establish accusations against Préfet Renzaho; am I mistaken? 
A.	You have just used the words that I desired to level accusations against Renzaho.  I don't like that.  But they came to put questions to me about Préfet Renzaho, and I answered their questions. 
Q.	Witness, you again saw ICTR investigators on the *******************2002; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	I think you must remember your statements clearly and you will tell me in whose presence those statements were taken down? 
A.	I think I answered that question, Counsel. 
Q.	Counsel, on the ********************2002, the investigators were still Lanciné Magssouba and            Mickel Stassin; is that correct? 
A.	As regards the date of the ******************2002, I think it was still the same investigators; yes, I think so. 
Q.	And was that still in the presence of Ms. Dior Fall? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Do you remember the subject of your hearing on that day? 
A.	I do not remember it very clearly, but you can always refresh my memory.  You were the person who gave us the different dates after all, the dates on which I was questioned.  And as you have access to the documents you can remind me of that and what is contained in those different documents. 
Q.	On that date, you were requested to provide a list of the roadblocks that had been set up in Kigali, according to your knowledge, and you provided a list of 80 locations; do you remember that? 
A.	I do remember that list that you are talking about.  And I was, indeed, asked to draw up such a list.  I do remember. 
Q.	So on the ***************2002, knowing the possible involvement of Mr. Ngirumpatse and what happened in Rwanda, was devoid of interest to you.  However, it was important to provide a list of the 80 locations of roadblocks; is that correct? 
A.	Counsel, I believe you are doing it on purpose.  You know very well that one responds to questions that are put to one, and you know how it happened.  And, of course, I provided responses to questions that were put to me, and that is what happened.  And that's how you understand it. 
Q.	Witness, in October of the year 2002,************************************************************ *****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************? 
A.	With reference to those roadblocks, I said -- or provided a description of the roadblocks that I could remember and that I had visited. 
Q.	So, you went to at least 80 roadblocks, to the extent that you could remember the precise location of those roadblocks eight years later; is that correct? 
A.	There were a lot of roadblocks set up in the city.  And I only mentioned the ones that I could remember.  There must have been ones that I could not recall. 
Q.	We will come back to that at a later stage, but that does confirm that you found it easy to pass through the roadblocks, whoever the people were who were manning them. 
A.	You are the one to say that, Counsel.  You are saying that it was easy for me to pass through the roadblocks.  What I say is that I went through the roadblocks and I saw them. 
Q.	Nevertheless, Witness, that was the prime subject of your questioning with Madam Dior Fall on the  *****************of the year 2002; was it not? 
A.	The date that you have indicated in the month of**********, as you said yourself, investigators came on a number of occasions.  And even if the names of those people do not figure, I believe that I gave the identity of those people who were manning the roadblocks, and I even believe that I mentioned the MRND, even if the names of those gentlemen do not figure. 
Q.	Witness, I have a third statement that was taken.  
MR. WEYL:
I'm sorry I have a slight problem with my headset here.  
 
Mr. President, I had a bit of a problem with my receptor, it wasn't working. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	A third statement was taken.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, we are having a bit of a problem following you.  What it seems from your line of enquiry is that you are extracting a sort of inventory of the statements that the witness has made.  But that is not helpful in terms of our purpose here.  I would have thought what would have been of interest would have been the exploration of some inconsistencies between statements he made and his testimony.  But I'm not quite certain as to what extent just putting an inventory of the statements on record helps anybody. 

MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I am coming to the point.  This brings me to note that for the first time we are talking about the substance of what the witness talked about on Thursday and Friday.  And this could bring to light the fact that up to that date, he was talking about anything and -- apart from the point.  So it has taken ten years for him to be able to throw light on the subject of the trial.  So, if my questions are not bringing to light this rather belated consciousness, I think that it is important for me to bring to light the fact that the witness has revealed a number of contradictions as to what he has said to you.  And I will come to that this afternoon, Mr. President.  

May I proceed now?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may proceed.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Now, Witness, you provided a third statement on the ******************of the year 2003; do you remember the subject or purpose of your statement? 
A.	Counsel, before answering your question I would like to come back to what you said previously.  You are saying that I am revealing something.  That is surprising, because I told you in what circumstances I responded to questions.  And you are saying that it is a revelation.  I would like to ask you to drop that term, because I told you how it came about that I answered those questions.  Now, that is what I wanted to say to you before answering the questions that you have just put to me. 
Q.	Witness, I am keeping to the questions, and I would like you to keep to answering my questions.  And the rest is relevant to what Mr. President just said.  Now, I would like you to come back to answering my question.  Now, on the ********************you met with the investigators of the Tribunal, once again, on the *********************2003; is that correct? 
A.	You say the********************, well it is possible.  You might like to refresh my memory on the subject, and remind me of the person, the name of the person with whom I met? 
Q.	On the *********************of the year 2003, you met with Mr. Baghel Upendra, and Joseph Sibomana was the interpreter in attendance; does that remind you of anything?  
A.	That is correct, I think that I met with those two people. 
Q.	Do you remember the subject or purpose of your meeting and interview on that day? 
A.	I'm sorry, but, once again, with reference to dates you talked of the*******************, I know that I met Upendra on the subject of the roadblocks.  And those roadblocks had been the subject of our previous interviews? 
Q.	Now, Witness, that is not entirely correct.  When we read your statement of the ********************2003, it transpires that you did, indeed, meet with representatives of the Tribunal on the ****************2003; and there is no record of that day, is there? 
A.	Yes, thank you for reminding me of that detail.  And in view of the fact that you have the documents before you, it would be most useful what is contained in each document because there were a number of different investigators.  And I cannot remember the dates at which the different investigators came to meet with me.  So it would be most useful to refresh my memory before discussing the content of those interviews. 
Q.	Witness, I am going to read an excerpt from your statement:  

"The ****************2003, I was contacted and interrogated, or questioned on the subject of the difference locations in the city of Kigali in the year 2004.  But, beforehand, I was asked to provide the most important locations and on the same date, the ****************2003, I gave indications of all locations that were asked of me, and I even showed them on a map of Kigali."  Now, does that refresh your memory? 
A.	Yes, I do remember that and what you have just read. 
Q.	Do you remember having mentioned the name of Mathieu Ngirumpatse on that occasion? 
A.	I do not remember, Counsel, not at all. 
Q.	I shall remind you of your statements:  "On that day a list of sites was presented to me, where the sites were indicated by coordinates.  And I can confirm the existence of all of those sites, with the exception of H12, where I do not know whether Mathieu Ngirumpatse was the proprietor of another house."  Does that refresh your memory? 
A.	Thank you for reminding me of that.  Yes I did, indeed, make that statement. 
Q.	And that was a statement that limited itself to answering questions put to you by an - investigators, because you were asked to identify and confirm the existence of sites; were you not? 
A.	I think that that is how things happened. 
Q.	And I thank you for being so sincere in your response, Witness.  Do you remember other meetings with investigators of the Tribunal after that date and in what circumstances they may have been conducted? 
A.	You know, investigators from the Tribunal came to see me on a number of occasions. 
Q.	I'm going to try and be more specific in my questions.  The first summary, or report of an interview that I have after the month of November 2003 is a report of the 5th, 6th, 27th, 30th and 31st of May 2004; does that remind you of anything? 
A.	Could you please repeat the dates, Counsel?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could counsel please be requested to speak a little bit more slowly? 
MR. WEYL: 
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, the interpreter had requested that you slow down a little bit to facilitate interpretation. 
MR. WEYL: 
I would like to apologise to the interpreters for having complicated things for them.  I shall repeat the days. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
And if I can request Mr. Weyl to clarify for the record whose statement this is because, as I read it, it doesn't come across as a statement of the witness but, rather, of the investigator.  So, if he could, please, clarify that?  Perhaps he should give the document to the witness if his going to ask questions about it, because it is a rather lengthy document which is full of substance. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, if the Prosecutor would like to take my place in order to define the meaning of my questions?  Well, I would like to remind you of the meaning and purpose of the question, and why I asked him for clarification.  My question was as follows:  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, do you remember having met with representatives of the OTP, or investigators in the month of May 2004, that is the 5th, 6th, 27th, 30th and 31st of May 2004? 
A.	I remember meeting them on the dates that you have just provided; that is correct. 
Q.	(No interpretation) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, you know what we are thinking is a follow-up to the comment we made earlier, that it is almost the end of the morning and you are still in these sorts of preliminary introductory stages, you are setting a stage.  Is it possible to get to the issue?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I believe that I have covered most of the ground, which is not necessarily preliminaries, but it is a lengthy process that led to the statements that were given by saying, for the first time, that there was a story, a story that he did not provide beforehand.  And subsequently in my cross-examination I will show that it was, indeed, a story because it is in consistent and it demonstrates all of the contradictions.  So, of course, that shows that it is a story.

Now, Mr. President, my question to Witness ALG was as follows:  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Did you meet the representatives of the OTP and investigators on the 5th, 6th, 27th, 30th, and         31st of May of the year 2004? 
A.	Counsel, I met those people at those dates.  However, I would like to react to what Defence counsel just said, Mr. President, with your leave.  When he expresses himself in such a manner, I think that it is actually contempt of Court because I remember that on one occasion I was questioned, and I responded to the questions that were put to me.  And I think that statements, or reports were drafted.  Now, to say that at one moment in time I invented a story, well, I'm surprised by that.  How can you say that it is a story, or an irrelevant relating of events when I was, in fact, responding to questions put to me by investigators?  I think that that kind of comment is, in fact, a contempt of Court, Mr. President. 
MR. WEYL: 
May I proceed, Mr. President?
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may proceed.  
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	And may I ask the witness, for the third time, to answer that question please?  Does he remember having been questioned by investigators and in what circumstances on what occasion and in what location? 
A.	Counsel, I met with those investigators.  And I believe that the location where I met with them is stated in the document.  You can always remind the Trial Chamber of that because you say yourself that it is stated in the document.  Those people were conducting investigations, and they asked me questions on Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  They also asked me questions on Joseph Nzirorera, and the same applies to Édouard Karemera and André Rwamakuba.  And I explained how I knew those men.  And I explained the behaviour of those gentlemen during the genocide. 
Q.	Witness, if you have an answer, please give it to the Trial Chamber.  Now in what location, specifically, did that interview take place?  If you know, please tell the Trial Chamber? 
A.	To the best of my recollection, we were at that time at the Tribunal prison or detention facility.  I believe that is where we met.  Whatever the case may be, I had come to testify against those people. 
Q.	When you gave your first statements calling into question Mr. Ngirumpatse, Nzirorera and Karemera, you were at the UN detention facility waiting to testify against them in a trial in which they were co-accused before this Tribunal; is that correct? 
A.	No, I believe that in the first statement that I gave on that subject, I underlined the responsibility of MRND members.  And if my memory is correct, that happened on the ******************2004.  On the      **************************I confessed.  I drafted my confession.  And I provided further information on the subject of those gentlemen.  That was a document for the attention of the public prosecutor of the supreme court of Rwanda.  And in that document, I provided details of the responsibility of the leaders of the interim government of the Interahamwe, et cetera, et cetera.  

I believe that even in the document dated the month of October that you mentioned previously, I also gave the responsibility of the leaders of the MRND and the Interahamwe.  That is to be found in statements dated the month -- dating back to the month of October and the month of November.  Even if those names were not given as such we were still talking about the top-ranking leaders of the parties, even if we did not mention individuals as such.  When we talk of senior leaders of the party we know who we are talking about, even if we don't mention names. 

MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I think we are putting our finger here on the relevance of my line of questioning because you have in the file all of the statements that were given, and you will be able to judge for yourself the contents of -- the contents of those statements, and the moment at which an alternative version of the story was given.  I would like to come back to my question.

Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
As you are aware, the statements are not evidence before the Tribunal, unless they are admitted as such. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I intend to tender into evidence said statements, but I think that it would be better to do so all at once rather than doing it piecemeal.  If you want me to do it piecemeal, I can do so.  But I thought would it be more expedient to do it all at once. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may proceed.  
MR. WEYL:
That is the reason why I have in the list of material disclosed to my colleagues the documents that I intend to tender into evidence subsequently.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Now, I will come back to you, Mr. Witness.  In the month of May 2004, you were at the UN detention facility and you had come to testify against Joseph Nzirorera, Édouard Karemera,                         Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and you said Mr. Rwamakuba as well, I believe? 
A.	On that occasion I believe that I remember that it was the investigators that put questions to me on the subject of those gentlemen. 
Q.	So, it was still relatively urgent for your statements to incriminate those people, against whom you had come to testify, was it not? 
A.	You should not put that question to me, Counsel. 
Q.	It was at that very time that it was important for you to start obtaining counterparts to your confession that you had provided in Rwanda? 
A.	I think I have explained myself sufficiently on this point, Counsel.  When you -- sorry, one doesn't expect anything in exchange.  In our country there were very tragic events.  We don't expect anything in return when we speak the truth as to the events that occurred.  It is you who is invoking this concept of interests or quid pro quo. 
Q.	Allow me, at least, to point out the circumstances, the combination of circumstances that you are here in Arusha to concoct something against Ngirumpatse.  When you are in your Rwanda prison that is when you make a plea statement which is as coherent as possible with these statements you are making to the Tribunal, which match as closely as possible in your statements to the Tribunal? 
A.	Counsel, you have read through many preliminary documents, preceding documents, prior documents, a document dated 19 May 1998.  I think I mentioned that I was begging forgiveness for what I had done.  So, it isn't as late as you claim it is.  As soon as I was arrested, and I beg that you refer to those statements, you will see that I state that I am begging for forgiveness.  There are other documents  relating to the hearing in Chambers, I don't remember the dates, (French spoken), being in chambers.  

There was another document dated the 22nd of February 2002, if my memory serves me right.  Well, that document bore on questions put by the Prosecutor.  And I was asked how I had used my time during the period in question, from April to July 1994.  It is an important document.  It is a quite lengthy document, ten pages.  And I said that one cannot consider one's self to be innocent,                          100 per cent innocent in relation to those events.  And that means what that says.  

There is another document I should like to remind you of; a document dated the ***************2004 where I followed the proceedings of a guilty plea and confession.  I addressed myself to the president of the supreme court, and I explained what happened.  In that document I explained what my experience of the genocide was, and the people that I considered as having a responsibility in the genocide.  And you will see that I mentioned the members of the interim government, and the MRND as leading officials.  Subsequently, I was asked to come to Arusha on the dates that you mentioned.  The investigators came back and asked me, focusing particularly on these names.  And I explained what I had to tell them.  And I'm sorry I have to say this because you have just mentioned the meeting of     May 2004.  I remember my letter was addressed to the Prosecutor of the ICTR, and not the president of the supreme court.  I explained in that document that the crime of genocide was committed not against -- only against Rwanda, but against the international community; and this crime had concerned the international community.  

So as of the moment that I had the opportunity to appear before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, I took the initiative of begging forgiveness before the international community because I could not be of assistance to the people living in the administrative area I was responsible for. 

I explained how people had a role in the genocide, the identity of those responsible.  I referred to some parts of my confession, and I explained better what was insufficiently well explained.  And that was in *******************************2004.  The purpose being to make quite explicit other documents entered before.  And I think it is usual to explain things as long as one, of course, is speaking the truth, in clarifying past events.  That was what I wrote in 2004.  

As to the other documents I can provide you with all of the necessary explanations.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I have been caught in my own trap because the answer was so long I can't even remember the question I put.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	You went into lengthy developments, but my question was a bit different. 
A.	Counsel, forgive me, but I felt it necessary to develop.  I am before the International Criminal Tribunal, I should, of course, avail myself of this opportunity to clarify matters. 
Q.	The best thing between -- before the International Criminal Tribunal would be to answer the question put to you.  And the question was, in respect to the simultaneousness between your entering guilty -- a detailed guilty plea, and the moment at which a statement is taken from you, even more detailed, which for the first time names Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera and Édouard Karemera.  The Court will have all of the preceeding statements, and would note that you did not incriminate them.  You have another question, Witness? 
(Pages 17 to 29 by Donna M. Lewis)























1215H
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness is asking to speak, Mr. President. 
MR. WEYL:
Can I finish my question and then you can put your question afterwards?  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Your statements have been taken in the course of five days -- five days over a month at the detention facility here.  Did you sign a statement at that time?  
A.	Yes, I signed a -- the documents.  

Mr. President, with your permission, I should like to say that he has just spoken of a concert of circumstances.  Well, that is possible -- that convergence of circumstances.  It is possible, but he is not listening to the answers that I'm giving him; whereas these answers are very important.  He does not wish to stick to the truth.  He wants to force me to say that I pleaded guilty; that I had recourse to the confession procedure when I was at the prison, whereas it was in Rwanda that I entered a plea of guilty.  I think it's because he must have some interest in forcing that on me.  The only thing I'm concerned with is speaking the truth.  
Q.	Witness, please do not make detours. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could -- could -- please, could -- no, I'm sorry, Mr. President, could counsel repeat those dates?  Counsel has just uttered a string of dates. 
BY MR. WEYL:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, your question did not get through to the translation process, so you will have to repeat it.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, on the 5th, 6th, 27th, 30th, 31st May, 2004 at the UNDF in the presence of a member of the Prosecution team on the 27th and 31st of May -- lead to a written statement that you would have signed? 
A.	If my memory serves me right, they prepared a report -- the investigator prepared a report.  I'm not sure if I signed it or not, but it was read to me for me to be able to see whether what was written matched what I said.  And I asked that some changes be made as I was entitled to do.  I asked them to correct some small mistakes in that report.  I think a report was made.  
Q.	We fully agree, Witness, a report was prepared on the basis of an interview, but it was not a statement that you signed? 
A.	In any case it was a report on the interview and the discussion.  A report is just like a statement; there's no difference.  It's a record of someone's testimony. 
Q.	The Chamber will assess the judicial -- the legal difference between a report and a signed statement. But, for my part I will return to my question and supplement it:  Were you given a copy of that report on the interviews? 
A.	It was read back to me, as I've just told you -- and I asked that corrections be made and I remember that I signed that report in the presence of the investigator on the 30th of August 2005.  
Q.	You signed that document on the 30th of October 2005 as it stood? 
A.	I think so; it was some time ago.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I think there may be some confusion, there's actually two documents.  The witness has just made reference to a statement which he did sign, but I believe Mr. Weyl was asking him about a report that was not signed.  So, maybe Mr. Weyl could clarify (inaudible).  It seems to me that both he and the witness are right but there's confusion between the two documents.  
MR. WEYL:
But we fully agree, Mr. Prosecutor.  I don't think that the document signed on the 30th of August 2005 is the report of the interview on the 5, 6, 3 -- (unintelligible) 27, 30, 31st -- 2004.  So, there's -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry if the interpreter got the dates wrong, because it's not possible.
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Do we agree, Witness? 
MR. WEBSTER:
What are we agreeing on?  Could you clarify that for the record, please? 
MR. WEYL:  
Thank you.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, I will ask you again if you signed -- to take it upon yourself, the report of the interview prepared after your interviews on the 5th, 6th, 27th, 30th and 31st of May 2004.  And, since you mentioned a statement that you signed in August 2005, the Prosecutor and I noted that that was a different document, so I'm asking you for the last time if you signed the report on the interviews in May 2004? 
A.	I don't remember -- I don't remember, but I don't think I signed that report.  But, there is a report -- a preceding report on our interviews with the investigator on the 30th of May.  It was read back to me.  I told them that I can confirm that it was, indeed, what I'd said, but I asked them to make some corrections.  

I also prepared a document on the 5th of May 2004 and the 18th of --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPETER:
-- of a month we didn't get --

THE WITNESS:
-- which was also signed when they came back to see me in September, when the investigator read it back -- read back the contents of the documents, so that I might confirm that it was faithful to what I'd said.  I think they came back to see me in September, and I think I signed one of the reports.  There are many documents.  I can't recall, but maybe you can refresh my memory by showing me some of those documents.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I think it would be better for the proceedings if you didn't volunteer so much information, and you tried to understand the question that was asked you and just answer it as far as it is possible.  
THE WITNESS:
Agreed, Mr. President, I shall endeavour to do so. 
MR. WEYL:
I have three more questions and then perhaps we'll be able to break, Mr. President, so as to not start on a new line of questioning; it might be the right moment. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, I have a question, I don't wish to -- it -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, Mr. President, could counsel repeat that question?  Dates again?  He asked, "Does the 
10th of May come between the 26th and the 27th of May?"  I'm sorry, he has to repeat it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I understand you are requested to repeat the question.  
MR. WEYL:
Well, perhaps, tired -- I'm tired and therefore not sticking to discipline.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	I was stating, Witness, that without going as far as taking judicial notice we agree -- agree that the 
18th of May 2004 occurs between the 7th of -- the 6th of May 2004 and the 27th of May 2004? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, what kind of question is that?  Come on, let's move forward. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I should like the witness to confirm that the handwritten letter he addressed through the director of the UNDF to the ICTR Prosecutor, including an annex, a memorandum regarding the testimony to be given to the ICTR in Arusha, Tanzania, signed on the 18th of May 2004, was indeed written after the first two interviews with the OTP team and was communicated -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
-- I'm not sure I got this.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	-- it was communicated to the people it was intended for after the interviews.  
A.	Counsel, I did not draft that document because I had just met the investigators.  As you are saying, it was my conscience which drove me to writing that document which -- it isn't because I met the investigators that I started to draft that document. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I was merely pointing out another coincidence of time and place.  And on the subject of coincidences of time and place can I ask you, Witness, when you were at the UNDF at that time in 
May 2004, whether you didn't meet Mr. Karakezi, Amri? 
A.	Counsel, I think I've answered that question.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, this way of eluding -- avoiding my question so as not to answer it, is not sufficient for me, and I think we can terminate this part of my cross-examination.  And I suggest that we might break now for lunch.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will take our luncheon adjournment now.  

Mr. Witness, I will remind you, as I have done before, that during this or any adjournment you don't discuss the case or your testimony with anybody. 
(Court recessed from 1229H to 1416H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may continue, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL:
Obliged, Mr. President -- actually, I was trying to sort out my earpiece.  

Mr. President, perhaps before we start, we would like to move into evidence the documents which we used this morning.  Perhaps we could do so in the absence of the witness.  In any case, in the fastest manner, I have about ten documents to enter into evidence in English, French and Kinyarwanda.  Do you want us to do so now, Mr. President? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does the Prosecutor have any objection (inaudible)? 
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
These being the statements of the witness?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, are they the statements of the witness? 
MR. WEYL:
Oui -- 
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
No objection, Mr. --

MR. WEYL:
(Microphones overlapping) ... that is the case, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, the Prosecutor has no objection.  You can move them in immediately.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, sir, I'm going to give the numbers and I'll  give them to you later.  

Mr. President, sir?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, perhaps, I could, Exhibit D. NG22, E for the English, F for the French and K for the Kinyarwanda. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why do you want to do it this way?  Do you want to do it one by one and take half an hour? 
MR. WEYL:
No, Mr. President, not really.  Now, if we can have them given to Mr. Issa in the whole and have them exhibited, then it will be simpler.

Mr. President, they are D. NG22 to D. NG33.  I stand corrected by Mr. Issa.  Perhaps we could cross-check and double-check the exhibit numbers during the break.  I'm sorry for this difficulty.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I suggest that Mr. Issa could mark them and then we can just look at them afterwards during the break, and if they are fine, then we can enter them in as one -- in one full swoop. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Issa?
MR. MJUI:
Yes, Your Honour, let me arrange them and then I will inform you during the break. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MR. WEYL:
Most obliged, Mr. President and my thanks to Mr. Issa.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, when you started your testimony you told us that you were quite familiar with the functioning of the MRND, is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I tried to be familiar with the party's functioning.  
Q.	So you're quite knowledgeable about its constitution, organs and ideology? 
A.	Yes, I knew all that, but as you can understand, I've forgotten quite a few of the information I had. 
Q.	But, Witness, my feeling was that you were here to share your knowledge in that connection with the Chamber.  That was the first purpose or the prime purpose of your testimony in this court.  Please remind us of the meaning of that acronym or abbreviation MRND, what is it in full? 
A.	Thank you, I believe I had answered that question.  In any case, let me repeat my answer.  Firstly, there was the MRND which was the single party.  Then, subsequently there was the MRND of the multiparty era.  When the MRND was a single party, it was the national revolutionary movement for development.  That is how the MRND was known when it was a single party in Rwanda.  With the advent of multiparty democracy, the abbreviation MRND remained, but it now meant in full the national republican movement for democracy and development.  The letter "D" stood for democracy and development; that was how it was known during the multiparty era.  
Q.	Witness, let us now look at the meaning you gave or ascribed to the MRND under the multiparty era, because we are in agreement.  What was the motto of the multiparty era -- MRND? 
A.	I cannot remember the words as were in the constitution, but you will realise that we have democracy and republic in the MRND abbreviation.  So that party aimed at fostering democracy and advocating democracy; that is what we have in the abbreviation.  There's also development -- I'm sorry, I'd forgotten it -- development.  
Q.	Witness, unless I had a slip of the tongue then you will have to bear with me.  My second question was not in connection with the abbreviation -- rather, it was in connection with the motto of the MRND party.  
A.	Counsel, I cannot remember everything.  In any case, it was a long time since I last read the document containing the motto, but I think there was unity as well as peace and development, and it was the same motto for the MRND during the single party era:  Unity, peace and development. 
Q.	Witness, I thank you.  You see, this is sort of what characterises a party's ideology, so I'm going to ask you would you remember what were the objectives of the MRND as are layed down in this constitution? 
A.	Well, talking about the objectives -- well, the objectives may mean something -- well, that the basic is what I've said -- defending or fostering democracy, advocating unity and peace, as well as the advancement of human rights.  But, I believe all those things were addressed by the motto of the MRND as well as the party's objectives.  Perhaps I should add that it was also necessary to protect and safeguard the sovereignty of the country.  I think I've given you the basics.  
Q.	Witness, if I were to read to you section 5C of the constitution, the objectives of the movement are, amongst others, unity, excluding all forms of discrimination.  What comments do you have to say to that? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
For the record, that was a free translation. 

THE WITNESS:
Yes, indeed, that was one of the principles of the movement.  But, in practice, that was not the case.  In any case, that was not what we observed, and if you want I can explain a number of things to you.  

You need to look at the nature of that republic, that democracy advocated by the party.  If you so wish, then we are going to revisit it, because it was not the type of democracy and republic which one would usually know, so if you want, then, we are going to revisit this issue. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, let us content ourselves with responding to the questions that I'm putting to you.  I believe that you are an intellectual.  You have an education; you understand the meaning of words and I think that if I put a question to you as to the ideology of the political party -- that does not call for an answer on the practices of the said party.  I will come to that if I so wish.  I'm now putting to you a question on the subject of the ideology of the party and I would ask you to answer it please.  So, article 5C of the constitution says that the movement pursues the purpose of unity, excluding all forms of discrimination.  Would you agree with me to say that the constitution of the MRND is based upon an ideology that is totally contrary to the principle of discrimination? 
A.	That is the case in the documents and in the constitution, but it is a problem in terms of facts and in terms of practice.  
Q.	Witness, in view of the fact that you are well versed in the functioning of the MRND, I would like you to tell us what were the organs that ran the party at a national level, because I must say that the terms that you have used throughout your examination-in-chief were very imprecise and very confused.  So, could you please tell me how and under what form the steering organs of the MRND took -- that is, under multiparty politics? 
A.	Counsel, in responding to the Prosecutor I provided him with responses and I think that you should refer to those answers that I gave to the Prosecutor on the subject of those questions.  
Q.	Now, Witness, I always say precisely what I think and I said to you that I thought that the responses that you provided were confused.  And in view of the fact that you are very knowledgeable of the functioning of the MRND I believe you could shed light upon this.  Now, if we refer to the statement that you made on Thursday I find terms that I do not find in the constitution of the MRND party.  Now, in view of your knowledge, could you please shed light upon these numerous ambiguities also the fact that there was supposedly a national executive bureau? 
A.	Counsel, you said that that was not mentioned in the constitution and even if you say that there is confusion with reference to what I said, I do not see how I can express myself differently.  I was talking about the national executive bureau, and it was the members of the bureau who led the party at a national level or who coordinated the activities of the party.  It is the steering organ of the party.  If you see any confusion there, I apologise, but otherwise I believe that I answered those questions on the basis of my observations.  
Q.	Witness, if we could refer solely to the constitution of the MRND, it would not be necessary for us to call you to testify on the MRND.  The fact that you are testifying here is purely because you know the MRND inside out.  Otherwise I might think that you are confused on the subject, notably with reference to what you said on Thursday morning where in less than a page of the transcript you talk -- in order to designate a structure, you talk about the national committee; you talk about the steering committee; you talk about the executive committee.  So, what is it?  What is the structure that you have in mind?  Is it the executive committee; the steering committee; the national committee?  Shed light on this, please -- otherwise just tell us that you do not remember.  
A.	Thank you.  When I used the expression steering committee or national executive committee, that was the supreme body, the national executive bureau.  Now, with reference to the national executive bureau, maybe the national executive bureau is the same one and the same thing as the steering committee.  

I told you -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Mr. President, I think that the witness needs to speak more slowly", says the Kinyarwanda booth because what he says is very confused.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the translators request that you speak a bit more slowly to facilitate their translation of what you're saying.  So could you just repeat your last answer and speak a bit more slowly?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President, as I have already said, it might be that the terminology in Kinyarwanda is not very clear.  You know, that when you express yourself in a language that is understood by many people it is possibly clearer.  But I believe that I expressed myself lengthily on the structure of the MRND party.  But in view of the fact that you wish to return to this subject, you must understand that there was a supreme body.  You called it the steering committee.  Very well, I told you that it was the national executive bureau; it was a bureau that comprised four people:  
The president, that was the president of the party, Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  There was a vice-president and a first vice-president, Édouard Karemera, and the second vice-president of the party, who was also a member of the steering committee, who was Ferdinand Kabagema.  And there was also this general secretary, who was called the executive secretary -- the national executive secretary and he was Joseph Nzirorera.  So, that is the supreme body as such and that was how it was composed.  Those were the individuals who were at the helm of the MRND party.  

Now, the other body or organ at a national level was the national congress.  I believe that I also mentioned that organ.  At the outset, another organ that was called the central committee was then called the national committee subsequently, and this committee comprised 44 members.  
And I think somebody tried to deny that claim but that's what I know.  

Each president of the party at a préfectoral level -- I'm sorry, four people were selected from each préfecture and they were members of the national committee.  There were also -- there was also the political bureau.  The political bureau was composed or comprised -- one representative of the party at a préfectoral level -- level of each préfecture, who was also a member of the national committee.  So that was 11 people in all.  This committee was led by senior leaders that I mentioned previously, and that is the president of the party notably.  So those are the organs of the party at a national level.  

At a préfectoral level, I explained that there was a préfectoral committee with a bureau comprised of three persons of which the president and the vice-president, I do not remember -- in fact, there were four members.  There was the president, the vice-president, the treasurer and the secretary.  At a communal level, there were other organs as there were also at secteur and cellule level.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, you are going a little bit fast for me.  I merely wanted clarification on the subject of national organs of the MRND party.  The Trial Chamber has access amongst the exhibits to the constitution of the MRND and in reading the said constitution will be able to note how confused your memory is and how it will be difficult to enlighten us upon the structure of the MRND party.  

And also, this would explain why during your examination-in-chief you used one term rather than another and we never knew whether you were talking about the steering committee, the national committee, the executive committee, the national executive committee, the political bureau, the executive bureau, the national bureau.  It's such a mixture and I'm not sure whether your final clarification will enable us to extract a coherent structure out of all this.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm going to object to that last remark from counsel.  I was here on Thursday and Friday and I recall that different translators used different terms to express the same concept, which is exactly what the witness said himself just five minutes ago.  

So for Mr. Weyl to recharacterise what the witness has said and to introduce an element of confusion on the record that's really not there from the witness's testimony is unfair to the witness and I'd request that that last remark be stricken.  
MR. WEYL:
I will respond briefly to Mr. Webster to say that even if an interpreter can use two different terms where there is a shade of meaning, he might use two different terms also to interpret a legal term or judicial term that might be mentioned in the constitution of a party, for example.  
Now, Mr. President --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, please, we don't want to spend time arguing on matters of this nature.  Basically, in the long run it is for us to determine what weight we attach to the witness's testimony.  If you need a clarification, you can ask for it without using pejorative words.  You can clarify from the witness, if you wish.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, to shed light on that point, maybe the Witness could tell us precisely which term applies to his thoughts when on the 26th of October, on page 36 of the French version of the transcript, he says that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was a member of the national executive committee of the MRND party.  And then four lines further on when talking about Joseph Nzirorera, he talks about the national committee of the party.  

Now, which is the true term -- the correct term? 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, Counsel, I shall repeat myself in order for Defence counsel to know precisely what I'm referring to here, whether it be Mr. Ngirumpatse, Mr. Joseph Nzirorera -- both of them were members of the national committee of the MRND; they were both members of that committee.  But in addition to being members of that committee, they were also members of other organs including the bureau -- that is, the national executive bureau.  And in practice, that was the organ that was at the helm of the party that was responsible for its management at a national level.  

From the year 1993, Mathieu Ngirumpatse was president and Édouard Karemera was first vice-president and Ferdinand Kabagema was second vice-president.  And finally, Mr. Nzirorera was the secretary general of the party. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, you wanted me to give you a further example, and this will provide me with a transition for my next line of questioning.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Now, on the 26th of October, Mr. Witness, you said that -- you said in one paragraph, you said that the Interahamwe were set up by the executive committee.  Then, three lines further on you say that the decision was made by the executive bureau as well as the national committee of the party.  Now, which structure created it exactly?  Was it the national committee, was it the executive bureau, was it the executive committee, which one? 
A.	Counsel, I would like for all this to be clear in order to do away with any doubt.  I said that the Interahamwe had been set up by the national executive bureau in cooperation with -- in fact, I don't quite know how to disassociate the two bodies, in reality.  The members of the national committee were numerous, but it was, in fact, the executive bureau that was in charge of daily management of the party.  
Q.	Witness, I would like you to thank -- to thank you for specifying and this has, in fact -- has added a fourth term to the three provided on Friday and we shall just have to deal with that.  

Witness, you said during your examination-in-chief that the Interahamwe was an organisation that was affiliated to the MRND party.  Could you tell us a little bit more or confirm that, please? 
A.	I think that I explained that the Interahamwe was a youth movement of the MRND and, in fact, that was what it was referred to as and that's what I stated.  I think that I explained that clearly whilst saying that it was a youth movement of the MRND.  That does not mean to say that it only had young members -- young men and young women, no.  There were also adults who were members, but, on the whole, we could say that it was the youth movement of the MRND party.  
Q.	Witness, my question was precise.  You said that on the 26th of October, on page 37 of the draft transcript, French version, you said that the Interahamwe -- I quote:  "Was an organisation that was affiliated to the MRND party".  Do you confirm that, yes or no? 
A.	I do not know how this was translated.  I would like to say that that is what I said.  I said that the Interahamwe was a movement -- the Interahamwe movement of the MRND, and it was part of the MRND in the sense that it was the leaders of the MRND party that set up that movement.  
Q.	Witness, I shall come back specifically to the transcript and remind you of the question that was put to you by Madam Prosecutor and also of the answer that you provided.  The question was:  

"Can you describe the relationship between the Interahamwe and the MRND party in general?"  

And, you answered -- and I shall read the six lines of your answer because they're interesting:  

"The Interahamwe was an organisation that was affiliated to the MRND party.  It had been set up by the senior leaders of the MRND party.  The Interahamwe were members of the MRND party.  So, in order to become a member of the Interahamwe organisation, you had first and foremost to be a member of the MRND party.  That is to say that the Interahamwe was an organisation that was affiliated to the MRND party."  

Now, on two occasions when talking about the relations between the MRND and the Interahamwe, you claim in a very peremptory fashion that the Interahamwe is an organisation affiliated to the MRND party.  Is that what you said, yes or no? 
(Pages 30 to 40 by Jean Baigent)


1500H 
THE WITNESS:
Counsel, that was well rendered and that is indeed what I said.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, you have a good knowledge of the MRND and its functioning.  Could you tell us, please, what an affiliated organisation to the MRND would be, exactly? 
A.	Earlier on, you read out an excerpt, and it was clear that it was an organisation that was based on the MRND, and it was clear that it was the senior leaders of the MRND that had set it up.  It was not an organisation that was set up by young people of their own initiative; it was members of the MRND party, and then was created an organisation called the Interahamwe from that party.  
Q.	And you say that that organisation was affiliated to the MRND party? 
A.	It was you yourself who provided that term.  I did not say that it was an affiliated organisation, I said that it was an organisation of the MRND.  I said that the Interahamwe belonged to the MRND.  They did not ask to be affiliated to the MRND; but, in fact, the MRND party set it up. 
Q.	So you are no longer in agreement with what you said on 26 October and what you confirmed but a few moments ago? 
Q.	Counsel, well, you say that they were affiliated to the other.  They belonged to the MRND; it is the same thing.  It is the same, apart from the difference in the terminology.  Otherwise it's the same.  It's really no different at all.  
Q.	Witness, you are here to tell us about your knowledge of the MRND and its structure.  You are not making any difference between organisations which are integrated and organisations which are affiliated? 
A.	Regarding the Interahamwe and the MRND, you asked me to establish a link between the two, and that is what I have done, and it is what I am going to repeat.  Be it affiliated or integrated, it's all a question of terminology, sir.  I am simply stating that the Interahamwe was set up within the MRND and were set up by senior leaders of the MRND, beyond any terminology differences which may be.  
Q.	Witness, this is not an issue of terminology.  You said the Interahamwe was an organisation.  Did it have a constitution? 
A.	I am not familiar with any constitution of the Interahamwe.  I never read that anywhere. I simply know that the Interahamwe of the MRND existed. 
Q.	Witness, you tried to explain to us -- and it was the purpose of your presence here to testify; you tried to tell us that the structure of the Interahamwe was copied from the structure of the MRND.  Do you still stand by that assertion? 
A.	Absolutely.  Because regarding Kigali-ville préfecture and surrounding areas, they had the same organs.  That was the prevailing situation in Kigali-ville préfecture and surrounding areas.  Regarding the other préfectures, there were Interahamwe at commune, secteur and cellule levels. 
Q.	Witness, I think this would suffice for our purposes.  Let us first focus on the Interahamwe organs at national level.  Can you tell us in a precise manner what were the Interahamwe organs at national level, according to you? 
A.	As I had said, from what I was able to observe, at national level there was the national committee of the Interahamwe as well as the national bureau of the Interahamwe.  Those, at least, are the two organs I was able to observe at the national level. 
Q.	Witness, so are you telling us this afternoon that there was no executive committee, no executive bureau of the Interahamwe or a national executive bureau of the Interahamwe? 
A.	Those were not the terms used with regards to the Interahamwe. 
Q.	Witness, if I were to put it to you that even the term "national committee of the Interahamwe" was not used, what would you have to say to that? 
A.	Well, that is your word.  I was down on the ground and I know what the situation was.  I know there were Interahamwe organs at national level. 
Q.	It is not just my word, sir, it is actually the truth, and the Court has the duty to make a determination on that truth.  

So if I were to put it to you that you are the first one in this courtroom to talk about the management organ of the Interahamwe, using that expression -- because the right expression of the steering organ of the Interahamwe was the national provisional committee -- would you comment on that? 
A.	Counsel, I thank you for mentioning that.  Indeed, you are right.  It was provisional, even though I did not use the term "provisional".  It was a provisional or (unintelligible) organ.  Elections were planned, but they did not take place. 

Let me at least congratulate you because you have acknowledged that that organ indeed existed, even though it was an interim organ. 
Q.	I thank you for your congratulations, sir.  There was no executive bureau or political bureau of the Interahamwe.  Are we in agreement on that?  
A.	Yes, there was no political bureau.  But regarding the national bureau, in practice, there was that organ.  Let me explain this to you.  When you talk about a bureau, you are referring to a group of influential people who are leading others.  But there were other lower organs which were managed by the most influential people at national level, and it was called a bureau.  You may use that word or discard it, but there was a group of people who were leading the others.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You tell us you were very familiar with the Interahamwe structure.  So, can you tell us -- and if you have any problems saying it aloud, then Mr. Issa can give you a piece of paper so you can write it down on a piece of paper, which paper will be entered into evidence --  can you tell us who you knew were the members of the national provisional committee of the Interahamwe? 
A.	You said I was familiar or very familiar with the Interahamwe structure.  I will tell you I was not "very familiar", as you were saying, with that structure.  There were some Interahamwe I knew, others I did not know.  I am talking to you only about the most renowned of those people.  The national president of the Interahamwe was Robert Kajuga.  He had two deputies.  The first deputy was Phineas Ruhumiliza and the second vice-president was Georges Rutaganda.  There was a secretary, a treasurer, two advisers and other members.  There were quite a few of them.  I am unable to know which of those people was an adviser, because there are certain people whose names I know and whom I was told were advisers, whereas others I was told were mere ordinary members.  

There was a secretary as well as a treasurer, whose names I did not know.  There was also one Nkezabera, who was an adviser; one Joseph Serugendo.  Those are the names which regularly came up at national level.  

At national level there was one Joseph Setiba, Séraphin Twahirwa, Aloys Ngirabatware,              Claude Nshimiye, André Nzabanterura, Épimaque Uwizeyimana (phonetic).  From what was being said, there were 11 or 12 people.  But the names I remember are the names I just gave, at least for now.  
Q.	So, as far as you remember, the name you just mentioned were the names of the members of the national provisional committee of the Interahamwe, correct? 
A.	Correct, Counsel.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And from what I observe, when you look at the best of your recollection of the national provisional committee of the Interahamwe, you did not at all mention the name of Turatsinze. 
A.	Counsel, I thank you very much for jogging my memory.  Indeed, that gentleman was a member of that group. 
Q.	Witness, I am not jogging your memory, I am simply reminding you of your testimony and the inconsistency between what you said on Thursday and Friday and what you are saying today.  Let me underscore that irrespective of what comments you will make to end on this line, if I put it to you -- and, Witness, let me add that if I were to put it to you, that you are the first witness to say that one Turatsinze was a member of the national provisional committee of the Interahamwe, what comment would you make? 
A.	No, sir. I think that fellow, Jean Pierre Turatsinze, was a member of that committee.  Besides, he had other duties within the MRND.  I have told you that. 
Q.	Witness, I am going to leave with the comments you just made to my question.  But let me make one last remark and you can make whatever comments you deem useful to make.  No witness at any point in time has come to say that the national provisional committee of the Interahamwe included one Turatsinze, and you are the one giving us the breaking news.  
A.	Well, I am the one committed by what I said.  I do not know about what others came to say here.  
Q.	Witness, the Prosecutor said the other day -- in fact, he referred to third-hand testimony, regarding the national provisional committee of the Interahamwe, do you think you are a first-hand or second-hand, Witness? 
A.	Counsel, if I were to tell you it was first-hand information, then it would mean that I was the one who set up the committee.  So the information I am giving you is information I learnt. 
Q.	So, Witness, what you are saying is that what you have said may be weighed, perhaps unfavourably, with what others have said regarding the national provisional committee of the Interahamwe? 
A.	Counsel, I think what matters is that I have told you all what I know.  So you may compare my testimony with others; that's your right.  But what matters is that I have told you what I know. 
Q.	Witness, you told us in chief that the officials of the Interahamwe were introduced to you in         January 1992.  Do you stand by that assertion? 
A.	Not all the officials of the Interahamwe were introduced to us, some of them were introduced to us. 
Q.	Where did that take place? 
A.	We were at the MRND secretariat in the Vedaste Rubangura building. 
Q.	At that time, were they already known by the name Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes.  If my memory is not failing me, I remember that we were told they had taken that name.  Perhaps I may be mistaken with regard to the month, but if my memory is okay, it must have been in January or February, and the MRND president for Kigali préfecture told us that they were the Interahamwe. 
Q.	Do you confirm that it was in the Rubangura building, Witness? 
A.	Yes, that is where we got that information. 
Q.	Witness, this is embarrassing to me because I have before me transcripts of your evidence at another trial in which you talk about the holding of that meeting and the introduction of Kajuga and               Jean Pierre Turatsinze in Félicien Kabuga's building.  Any comments, Witness? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
(Microphones overlapping)...as a point of procedure, can Mr. Weyl tell us the trial, transcript, and the page, please; the date of testimony and the page?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I am embarrassed, because if I have to give the name of the trial, then we will have to move into closed session because it was evidence given during a closed session.  And Prosecution counsel knows that they disclosed to us only one series of transcripts of prior testimony of the witness in only one trial.  

So, Mr. Prosecutor, you should not ask us to identify the trial, the transcripts of which they had disclosed to us.  So I think I should just stay within --  
MR. WEBSTER: 
(Microphones overlapping)...the date of this testimony and the line.  I don't need the name of the trial, but I am simply trying to find the reference that Mr. Weyl is relying on.  
MR. WEYL:
I agree with my learned friend perfectly.  Transcript of *****************2006, page 28, lines 19, 20, and 21 of the French; lines 28, 29, 30 and 31 of page 27, English version.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Now, Witness, you mention that Kajuga and Turatsinze were introduced to you when you were in Félicien Kabuga's building.  Do we agree on that?  
A.	Counsel, I do not know whether I was properly construed or whether I was mistaken.  So, I do not know whether on that occasion I was mistaken or whether the interpreter rendered my testimony in the way you just read it out to me.  I think it is a mistake.  Perhaps on that occasion I was either mistaken or that the person who recorded my evidence was mistaken, because everybody knows the Kabuga building very well, but when those people were introduced to us, we were at Vedaste Rubangura's building.  
Q.	Witness, there was no meeting which you attended and during which Kabuga and Turatsinze were introduced in Félicien Kabuga's building.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I hesitate to be disruptive, but I am still looking for the reference and I can't find it.  Now, if Mr. Weyl could kindly just direct us to what question or what response includes a reference to the Kabuga building, it would be f assistance,  because I have looked through both the English and French, and I don't see that reference based on the information that was just given to us.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, I have found that.  It's at page 25 of the English transcript, and it begins on line 22, when he is asked, "How did you come to know about this?"  And on page -- at line 29, he says "the meeting took place in the building belonging to Félicien Kabuga."  It's phonetically spelt.  
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE: 
If the reference that I have found is correct, Mr. President, then my learned friend needs to go on the other page as well -- my friend, Mr. Weyl.  And I am specifically referring, on page 26, to lines 11 to 15. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, my thanks go to my colleagues Robinson and the Prosecution counsel for their assistance regarding the English version.  Let me say that if I understand the objection from Prosecution counsel very well, then the witness during the same testimony, in a short moment, claimed that the meeting took place at Kabuga's building and then further down the line says that it is possible that it was a meeting which took place in another building.  It's up to the Court to make what determination it deems necessary.  
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE: 
We should endeavour to be fair to the witness, Mr. President.  What the witness said, in correcting the transcript, was -- and I quote, "In fact, what I said was that the meetings of the MRND committee were held in the building of the Vedaste Rubangura", and then there was an attempt to spell it.  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation) 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, my intention is to move into the evidence the portions of the transcripts, pages 28 and 29 of the French version and pages 25 and 26 of the English version, trial transcript of ****************** 2006.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, admitted.  
MR. WEYL: 
And, Mr. President, perhaps it is also necessary to tender them under seal for the same reasons as those which precluded me from naming the trial in open court.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Admitted under seal.  The registrar will give us the number in a short while.  
MS. KOUO:
D. NG34, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Will it be A and B for the English and French?  
MS. KOUO:
E and F, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
E and F.  Thank you.
(Exhibit No. D. NG34E and D. NG34F admitted, under seal)  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, is it a convenient time for us to enjoy a break?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it's about 3:30.  You used the phrase "enjoyment".  How far have you got in your cross-examination?  About how much longer do you anticipate that you need?  
MR. WEYL: 
I don't remember using that phrase, Mr. President.  Perhaps it may be a translation problem.  I don't remember having used that word, particularly.  But to answer your question, I believe that I will be done latest tomorrow before the morning break.  I hope so.  And if that is the case, then I will be, you know, within the time frame, and also I will be even way beyond -- or I should say below the 25 -- discount we had agreed upon with the Prosecutor.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  

Mr. Weyl, what I had heard or what was translated was that you asked if it was a convenient time for us to enjoy the break.  I thought that my enjoyment of the break would have been improved if I knew you were going to finish your cross-examination in a short time.  Now, we take the recess now. 
(Court recessed from 1532H to 1600H)

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, it might be appropriate for us to give our decision at this stage on the objections which you raised on Thursday to the admission of the evidence on the giving of orders for roadblocks to be set up.  

Now, we -- without going into the detail that occurred at pages 65 of the draft transcript in English -- I don't have the French reference --  I don't think I need to repeat what transpired.  

Now, we think that paragraphs 36, 37, 38 and 39 of the indictment unambiguously put on notice the allegation that Mathieu Ngirumpatse participated in the setting of roadblocks and their control and that was part of the Prosecution's case.  So we think that ALG's testimony falls within the framework of the allegations that were set out in the indictment itself.  

Now, just as a comment, we also feel that that the letter and the specific instructions to set up a roadblock were -- material facts that had to be pleaded in the indictment.  And in the context of this witness's evidence, it seemed that some of his testimony, particularly with regard to the letter, resulted from his response to the enquiry about how he knew that the MRND members, including Ngirumpatse, had authorised the roadblocks.  In these circumstances, we have decided to overrule your objection.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, let me resume my cross-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping) 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness ALG, you were not a member of the national provisional committee of the Interahamwe; am I correct? 
A.	You are correct. 
Q.	Neither were you a member of the national committee of the MRND? 
A.	You are right. 
Q.	You did not have any activities in the national secretariat of the MRND? 
A.	No. 
Q.	So, kindly tell us under what circumstances you found yourself attending briefings given by Turatsinze or the relay of instructions to Turatsinze and the relay of instructions to Turatsinze from the interlocutors of the MRND? 
A.	Counsel, I would like to answer your question, but I believe that that question had already been put to me by the Prosecutor and I had answered it, because, actually, it's the same question.  So I wonder if I have to answer the same question once more.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I would like the witness to answer my question the way I have put it to him.  
THE WITNESS:
I will do so, Mr. President. But I will repeat the answer I had already given, because that question had been asked by Prosecution counsel.  

What I said was that I did not need to work in the national secretariat to have information regarding the national secretariat.  Information can reach you from everywhere and under various circumstances.  True, I was not a member of the national committee,****************************************************.  I believe I told you so already.  In fact, I was -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And, Mr. President, the witness just mentioned*************************************, in the French version. 
THE WITNESS:
-- and you know one can have access to information from various sources.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Interpreter, thank you very much for the unofficial redaction, which I confirm.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, need I remind you that you are a protected witness, so you may be careful not give answers having a bearing on your identification when I put questions to you.  However, let me remind you of the answer you had given to the Prosecutor to a question which was not exactly the same as mine.  And I would like you to answer to the point and factually regarding the type and nature of information you received, because in the final analysis you say you are a second-hand witness in that connection.  What is the nature of your information?  
A.	Counsel, I gave you information.  Unless you want more than I have told you, I have already told you quite a lot.  I told you what Turatsinze did, the information which he communicated, the instructions which he gave, and I said that he was the liaison person.  I have told you of the Interahamwe's activities, that he convened meetings.  When the Interahamwe had to undergo military training, he was the one to relay such information to them.  When they had events to organise, it was Turatsinze who would invite the Interahamwe.  Regarding instructions for the Interahamwe to comply with the orders of the soldiers and what had to be the conduct of the Interahamwe with regard to cooperation with the MRND and the other parties, I believe I had said everything concerning Turatsinze.  The fact is that what the Interahamwe did was unfortunate.  
Q.	Witness, that was not my question.  My question, specifically, was to know what your sources were -- who your informants were.  
A.	Counsel, perhaps you want me to contradict myself.  I don't really know what you are after.  To a question put to me by the Prosecutor, I said I had various sources, I even gave names of people.  I think it is exactly the same question as the one put to me by the Prosecutor, so you can refer to the answer I gave the Prosecutor.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the counsel is entitled to find out whether your evidence would remain consistent.  So he is entitled to find out whether you would give him a different answer to the one you gave the Prosecutor.  So you should answer his question.  
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Mr. President. I am going repeat what I have said already.  

I got the information from various credible people.  Firstly, I told you that****************************** ******************.  Now, those who represented us at the political bureau, there was the president of that organ who closely followed party activities and who would come and report to us regarding the activities of that party as well as instructions or guidelines which had been adopted.  That is a manner of information conveyance.  

Secondly, I could get information from Interahamwe who worked with Turatsinze.  Now, if you wish, I can remind you of their names.  I believe I mentioned Joseph Setiba.  I believe I had mentioned Bernard Maniragaba in that connection.  Those are examples.  

I told you also that I worked with conseillers who were Interahamwe and who even attended meetings organised by the national secretary.  So they always briefed us of the circumstances under which those people came and met them and what was said. I mentioned Angeline Mukandutiye, schools inspector, who had an office in the commune office building.  She always told me of the meetings she attended and what went on during these meetings.  There was also Odette Nyirabagenzi.  Those are the names of people who provided me with information.  

Information was gathered from the Interahamwe or from those various state employees, and the Interahamwes knew full well that I was a member of the same party as they themselves.
BY MR. WEYL: 
Q.	Witness, you mentioned the word "example".  The names you just gave, were they what made up a comprehensive list of your sources or were they just some examples from your list of sources? 
A.	I said those were just some of the people who gave me information.  There were even others whose names cannot be remembered by me here and now. 
Q.	Therefore, Witness, I would ask you to make an effort and give me a complete list of your sources, because that is the purpose of my question, and that is why I was not satisfied by the answer you gave the Prosecutor.  
A.	Counsel, I just told you a while ago that there were certain names I no longer remember.  You yourself, last Friday, acknowledged that one cannot remember everything. 
Q.	Witness, you see, the difference between you and me is that I am not testifying to accusations which are pregnant with meaning and coming to give second-hand information regarding things I did not witness myself.  So it is important that you give a complete list of your sources.  And we expect the witness to come and say not what he did not see but what he was told about, and also we need to know the complete list of your sources.  
A.	Mr. President, sir, Defence counsel is making things complicated for me.  It is not an easy task remembering all names.  Perhaps I forgot to mention this:  On account of my position, several people provided me with information.  There are several things I witnessed personally.  Regarding firearms, I visited Turatsinze's office.  I had gone to see the national secretary, who, at the time, was Mathieu.  Personally, I saw Turatsinze.  That concerned firearms.  I witnessed that fact.  It is not something I heard from somebody else.  

That said, regarding the others, I believe my answer is clear.  
Q.	Well, Witness, we will have to live with that.  You mentioned one of your sources, Setiba.  Did            Mr. Setiba tell you, one day, as follows, "You know, ALG, I attended a meeting and Turatsinze had come to convey instructions from the MRND".  Is that the way he explained those things to you?  
A.	Let me tell you that Setiba is just a name you would take at random.  But what I can tell you is that** ****************************************************************, and during that period we dwelled at length on quite a few things.  He told me a lot of thing, including what you just said.  
Q.	More specifically, regarding the lone example, which we can look at in depth, did Setiba tell you who Turatsinze was answering to? 
A.	Thank you.  Turatsinze reported to the MRND national secretary, and he was the one who conveyed to him instructions for onward transmission to the Interahamwe.  So either the party president or the secretary general would give him those instructions and guidelines for transmission to the Interahamwe, but he himself said that he answered to the national executive secretary of the MRND. 
Q.	So Setiba was very specific in that connection.  Did he tell you who he answered to? 
A.	Absolutely, there is no mistake about that. 
Q.	Witness ALG, I am a bit embarrassed because it takes me back almost to the beginning of my cross-examination this afternoon.  Your knowledge of MRND structures, did it allow you to make a difference between executive secretary, secretary-general, national secretary?  
A.	Thank you.  Perhaps when speaking I said national executive secretary or secretary-general of the MRND.  Indeed, those were the terms used.  
Q.	Kindly tell us what was the right expression -- the right designation for the MRND organs.  Was it executive secretary? 
A.	The two terms were used.  But if you want me to give you the names of those who held those positions, I will indulge you.  Firstly, it was Édouard Karemera then Mathieu Ngirumpatse and then lastly      Joseph Nzirorera.  Those were the people who held the position of national executive secretary or secretary-general of the party.  All of those terms were used invariably, just as I am doing.  
Q.	Witness, whenever there is a question to which you do not have an answer, you try to give an answer to a question which I did not ask you.  Now, you say all those expressions were correct: General secretary -- or secretary-general, national executive secretary. But none of those two was a correct one, because the only two -- the designation was national secretary.  
A.	Counsel, I am delighted that at last you have understood the position we are talking about. 
Q.	Witness, let us talk about the Interahamwe cards.  You told us under oath that all members of the national executive bureau had the Interahamwe cards.  Please tell us which organ you were referring to or you were thinking about when you mentioned the national executive bureau, which does not have any statutory basis, and all the members of which, according to you, had Interahamwe membership cards? 
A.	You were the one mentioning the existence of those cards.  I believe I said they were Interahamwe.  I do not remember saying that they had cards.  Otherwise, the organ which I was thinking of is the organ which had your clients as members; and they headed the party at national level.  

Perhaps I must elaborate:  From 1991 to 1993, the president was Juvénal Habyarimana.  From 1993 to 1994, Mathieu Ngirumpatse replaced him in that position -- from July 1993.  Then from 1991 to        April 1993, Édouard Karemera was the secretary-general of the party.  Édouard Karemera was the first vice-president of the party, and Kabagema, Ferdinand, was the second vice-president of the party.  Whereas Mathieu Ngirumpatse was secretary-general from '92 to '93.  From July 1993, Nzirorera replaced Mathieu in that position, because Mathieu Ngirumpatse had become the president of the party.  There you are, Counsel.  

When I speak of that organ, those are the people that I am referring to.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I do not know whether the time given over to questions that I did not ask will be deduced or deducted from the time given over to my cross-examination, but my specific question did not ask for such an answer that was completely off course.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Now, with reference to what happened 12 years ago, may I call into question the quality of your memory, when you do not even recall what you said last Thursday?  You say that you do not remember having talked about Interahamwe membership cards.  And I shall read back to you your statement of Thursday the 26th of October, where, in response to the question, "Could you give us names of those people who were members of the Interahamwe and who exercised or performed duties within the party", you responded by saying, "On basing myself on their behaviour and on the support that they provided for the Interahamwe, I can confirm that all the members of the national executive bureau, who, what is more, created the Interahamwe, were Interahamwe, and they provided support for the Interahamwe, they had Interahamwe membership cards."  And my question was, "Well, who were the people who carried Interahamwe membership cards", and you said that you had not mentioned Interahamwe membership cards.  And what is your comment to that? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Before we have a response, can I please have a reference to the page number in the French draft transcript? 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I already have enough to do in order to understand the briefs addressed to us by the Prosecution, and I will give him now the reference to the French version:  Page 38, lines 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11; and the word "Card" is to be found at line 11 of the French version.  And I am sorry that I can't be more specific as to the English version, Mr. President. I would also add, Mr. President, that we do not have the draft English version, and that, very exceptionally, we did not have even the official French version of the draft.  We have the printed draft version from CaseView, because the court reporters were not able to give us the draft of Thursday's hearing.  So I am working with the tools that I have at my disposal, Mr. President. 
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE: 
For what assistance it lends, Mr. President, in the English transcript, it is page 32, at lines 25 -- sorry, 26 to 34.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Has Witness ALG made the most of the time allocated to this search in order to refresh his memory with a view to remembering that he did, in fact, mention the membership cards on Thursday morning, whereas this afternoon he now says that he did not talk about them?  And I would like him -- about those cards -- and I would like him to comment on that, please.  
A.	You say to me that this is quite a recent occurrence, and you also say to me that it is probably difficult for me to remember past events.  And these are all theories; I do not think we need to come back upon them.  You might even forget something that you yourself said but a few moments ago.  But I confirm that I did say that.  And maybe the question of the cards went out of my mind, but I do remember now what I said and I can confirm it.  

I had forgotten about the issue of the membership cards, but with reference et al with what was said, and the behaviour, notably, I can confirm that very probably they did have Interahamwe cards -- membership cards.  And I saw other people who were Interahamwe who had membership cards and who were adults and who supported the Interahamwe, but I didn't necessarily see the membership cards, as such.  
Q.	Now, Witness, you understand fully why I am insisting upon that point.  You said that they had Interahamwe membership cards and my question is, quite naturally, as follows:  Did you yourself personally see an Interahamwe membership card made out to the person of President Habyarimana? 
A.	No, I did not.  What I can confirm and what I have already confirmed is that in view of their behaviour, they were Interahamwe.  I have said that and I shall repeat it.  
Q.	Witness ALG, did you see with your own eyes a membership card for the Interahamwe made out in the name of Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	No, I have already answered that question.  I did not see such a membership card.  
Q.	Now, I am going to save time and not put the same question with -- as to the other co-Accused, but you will agree with me that we have to make the distinction between what you say you saw and what can be deduced or what can be put down to intuition.  Can you not confirm that?  
A.	I didn't understand that that was the question.  

If I think that information given to me is believable, then I consider it to be believable.  And the same goes for witnesses who provide you with information that you believe to be credible.  You consider them to be credible.  Now, in everyday life, there are things that you see with your own eyes, but there are also things that you have heard from other people who are supposed to be in the know.  That is the same situation as my own.  And when I come to be tried, then such elements will be used.  You are putting questions to me on the basis of information that has been given to you by your client, for example.  I do not know what he has said to you.  He might have said to you that he did not have a membership card, whereas he did or quite the contrary.  Whatever the case may be, you are founding or basing yourself on information that you have received, and if you consider them to be -- it to be credible, then so be it.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, I do not believe that we understand each other, nor do I believe that you are understanding the scope of the oath that you took before this Trial Chamber.  On Thursday morning you said, under oath, that they were carrying Interahamwe membership cards.  You did not say, "I think they had Interahamwe cards" or "We might have thought that they had Interahamwe cards", you said in a peremptory fashion, under oath, "They had Interahamwe membership cards".  So we will now agree that that was not correct and that you can confirm that was not correct.  
A.	Counsel, what I can confirm, and what I said, is that I showed you how many of them were Interahamwe. If you want to harp on about this Interahamwe membership card and that I didn't see it, well, fine, I am repeating to you what I said.  
Q.	Now, once again, Mr. Witness, we are not in examination-in-chief here, and I have not called you in order to hear what I want to hear; I am referring to your statements given in examination-in-chief.  You talked about Interahamwe membership cards because you believed that it was of interest.  And you were the one who talked about Interahamwe membership cards, saying that the members of the national executive bureau were card bearers and you are saying today that you cannot now confirm it.  Is that correct? 
A.	Counsel, I believe that I have answered that question, and you're coming back to it constantly, but the answer is not going to change.  
Q.	The Chamber will determine, indeed, to what degree the answer has not changed.  
Now, Witness, on this question of membership cards, I would like to ask you to comment.  How can you explain that first-hand witnesses, who were the most directly involved in an organisation to which you say that you were not a member, how can those first-hand witnesses say that there were no membership cards? 
A.	Yes, thank you, Counsel.  Are you saying that there were no Interahamwe cards at all?  It's quite the contrary.  Those who gave you information of that type lied to you.  I personally saw Interahamwe cards.  There were even photographs on those cards showing the bearer of the card.  

Now, it is different with reference to membership cards for the MRND members, because those cards did not bear photographs.  However, the Interahamwe membership cards did.  
Q	Witness, to be precise or specific, did you know that some first-hand witnesses have said that there was a specimen membership card, but that it was not possible to issue cards because it would have been too complicated and, as a result, there were no Interahamwe cards?  Do you think that you know better than the witnesses who stated that before this Trial Chamber?
(Pages 41 to 54 by Judith Baverstock)























1445H
THE WITNESS:
I have answered that question by saying that I saw some Interahamwe membership cards, whether they were temporary or not I do not know, but you have just said that they were specimens, temporary.  I do not know.  I just saw Interahamwe membership cards.
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, could you tell us what, precisely, you saw in the way of Interahamwe membership cards? 
A.	It was a long time ago now.  I really don't remember, but I remember there was an allocated space for the photos of the bearer; there was also the flag of the party; but that was a long time ago, and I didn't expect to have this question put to me, but I remember that there were the colours of the flag of the political party, and those were Interahamwe cards.  Whatever the case may be, those cards did not resemble the membership cards for MRND members. 
Q.	So you cannot tell us who were the bearers of those cards that you saw with your very own eyes? 
A.	I shall give you a few names.  I saw a number of cards.  I can give you André Sebontarura (phonetic), ***************************.  He had an Interahamwe membership card.  There was Odette Nyirabagenzi, and those are the names that I remember right now, straight off. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness, you talked about the objective of the Interahamwe, and I'd like to concentrate on the terminology for a moment.  You are talking about the Interahamwe movement here, presumably?  Was that the specific designation for the Interahamwe movement?  
A.	I might have expressed myself in my own way, but I was responding to a question basing myself on the knowledge of Interahamwe activities. 
Q.	And the name was Interahamwe, we agree on that? 
A.	Yes, indeed, they were called the Interahamwe. 
Q.	They were not called Interahamwe za MRND? 
A.	Well, when people talked of the Interahamwe, people knew what Interahamwe they were referring to because no other organisation bore that name.  It was the MRND who had Interahamwe, except that after the 6th there were members of MD Power, PL Power youth movements.  All those youth movements called themselves Interahamwe, and they behaved in the manner of Interahamwe members. 
Q.	Now, Witness, thank you very much for that, but you're going a little fast here.  My question was with reference to the specific title, Interahamwe.  We will agree that it is the Interahamwe za MRND? 
A.	That is indeed correct. 
Q.	Now, Witness, you know how specific I am being about the terminology we are using this afternoon, so we are now referring to Interahamwe za MRND, and you said -- and I believe at that time you were thinking about the Interahamwe za MRND, you said that those Interahamwe fought political parties using force, is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Did the Interahamwe za MRND, whether they be made or set up in the manner that you say, which I deny -- now, the other parties, as a reaction, did they subsequently set up youth movements or was it as a result of the youth movements being set up by other movements, other political parties, that the Interahamwe was subsequently set up? 
A.	Those youth movements were set up virtually at the same time, but I think I explained saying that kubohoza, that is, the use of force, was the members of the opposition who used force, and the Interahamwe, then, did the same, subsequently.  But, if we look at this more closely, those youth movements were set up at the same time. 
Q.	Now, Witness, I will agree with the first part of your response, but I would disagree with you on the second part.  I totally agree with you when you say that the MRND and its supporters were victims of the kubohoza and that the youth movement of the MRND defended themselves against that practice, but that is about the only element of your testimony that I support.  You wanted to say something? 
A.	You are free to accept what I am saying.  I know that you are defending an accused person in this trial, and you are attempting to free him of these allegations, but the most important thing is for me to tell the truth.  And when I say that those youth movements came into existence during the same period, I'm talking about the period of multiparty politics.  And, subsequently, the youth movements of those opposition parties did not continue attacking the MRND.  It was quite the contrary.  Last Friday, if I remember correctly, a question was put to me and I wanted to talk about it with a view to explaining the slogan Togamdburendi (phonetic), which means that armoured vehicles are not brought under attack.  And I explained to you where that slogan came from.  If you wish, and with the President's leave, I can explain it to you.  I can explain to you the origin of those slogans. 
Q.	Witness, I was covering another point which referred to a section of your response that was, in fact, in keeping with my perception of the situation.  The second part of your response was contradicted by events, because after the setting up of youth movements of other party's young supporters of the MRND decided to set up the Interahamwe za MRND movement.  You said that the Interahamwe -- I think you were referring to the Interahamwe za MRND at that time and I am more or less anticipating the way you see things --  you say they committed acts of violence and killing.  Do you know that such killings were committed in Rwanda in 1993 and 1994 and that they were blamed upon the Interahamwe, whereas they did not commit them?  Did you know that?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Sorry, if we could go back to the witness's previous response I'm curious to hear what he had to say about the slogan he mentioned and if his response is going to be -- if his answer is going to be responsive to Mr. Weyl's question, I think the Court would welcome a response along those lines.  The witness asked the President if he could continue in his answer and I didn't quite hear a response to that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It`s currently cross-examination and the witness will be up for re-examination and the Court can ask questions if it wants to in the future.  But I believe Mr. Weyl should conduct his cross-examination.
THE WITNESS:
Counsel, with reference to the question that you put to me, it is highly possible.  However, what I am saying to you is what I saw with reference to the behaviour of the Interahamwe.  As to what was blamed upon the Interahamwe, I do not know.  It does not concern me.  What I am saying to you is what I know about the Interahamwe.
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, I am going to read an excerpt to you that corroborates what we have just talked about, which is an excerpt from a book written by Lieutenant Rutibiza (phonetic).  Page 192 of that book.
MR. WEBSTER:
Could a copy of this document be placed in front of the witness?  He can read French and he`ll be able to read it himself and follow along with Mr. Weyl?
MR. WEYL:
I think the witness can read French, as he told us, and he can even write it, otherwise, he is not the one who wrote his statements in May 2004, which are handwritten statements in French.  One would say if he can write French then he can also read French.  I can read it or hand it to the witness.  For the purpose of speed, it would have been easier for me to read it instead of having to give it to him.  

So I can read.  

"We need to remember that the attacks of February 1993 -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can -- if you have no objection to the witness seeing the document, you can read it and he can go along with you.
MR. WEYL:
In order to avoid Mr. Issa having to move about twice I decided to give him two passages, Mr. President.
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, do you have that passage before you? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	So, let me read it, then you will give me whatever comments you want to give.  "Let us remember that February 1993 attacks were launched by the RPA so as to assess its striking force, as well as the progress of the network commando's mission.  That commando (sic) had been set up and organised to create chaos at national level, particularly by infiltrating the militia of the MRND and CDR and by strengthening their terrorist actions to ensure that Tutsis always remained the targets of killers would make it such that the resumption of combat would be justified."  Do you have any comments to make, Witness? 
A.	Counsel, I thank you.  From what I can see, there is no contradiction between what this under passage and what I'm telling you.  If RPF members infiltrated the MRND and CDR militia, it does not relieve the Interahamwe of their responsibilities.  You saw the activities.  It does not change anything.  What matters was the acts carried out by the Interahamwe.
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I would like to move to tender this first passage.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's only in French language, eh?  
MR. WEYL:
I have only the French version, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted in evidence.
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, may I continue?  Here reference is made to February 1993 but it was not only in February 1993 that Interahamwe committed those acts.  This passage is referring only to February 1993.  A while ago I mentioned of the barbarous acts the Interahamwe indulged in.  Before that period, the Interahamwe were killing Tutsi.  Now, if the Interahamwe were killing Tutsi, do you want to tell me, Counsel, that the Tutsi were killing their own?  So I can see that this passage does not in any way water down the mistakes of the Interahamwe.
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I have a second passage, which is before the witness, an excerpt of the same book, page 210.  In the middle of the page there is a line which is in bold, "The night of the 29th to the 30th of November 1993." Do you have that, Witness?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry, we were not served with page 210.  There are a few excerpts.  There is a page 209, but I don't see a page 210 in the materials provided to the Prosecution.
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, we disclosed pages 209 to 211.  In any case that is the slip I have before me and photocopies were made of the book, the flat form that is 210 and 211, so page 210 would be on the left-hand side.
MR. WEBSTER:
I can surrender my copy to Mr. Weyl so he can inspect it, but I do not have page 210 and 211 here and I would like to see it while it is being read to the witness.
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, unfortunately the Defence has access to a photocopy machine which sometimes eats pages.  We actually were relying on the slip which made copies of pages 210 and 211.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have another copy?  That would save time.
MR. WEYL:
I have my book.  I have another copy of the book.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That will save time.  

Mr. Issa? 
MR. WEYL:
I'm really sorry that Mr. Issa had to move again.
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, do you have page 210 with a passage which is highlighted with a green marker the night of the 29th to the 30th of November 1993, troops of the Charley mobile unit under the command of GO1 Gisharegoma (phonetic), and the witness says as follows -- 
A.	I don't have that passage.  Mr. President, that is not a document given to me.  I have page 224-225.
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, this is really a series of misfortunes.  I wonder if my learned friend has pages 224 and 225?  If that is the case I will have to restrict myself to those portions.
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, do you have before you page 224 with a sub-heading from the 21st to the 22nd of February 1994 which states as follows:  "Minister Felicien Ngatabazi (phonetic) was murdered by members of the RPA who had infiltrated the Interahamwe."  Do you have that before you?   
A.	Yes, I can see the passage. 
Q.	Can it be inferred therefrom that acts attributed to the Interahamwe were committed by others? 
A.	That is possible, but what I confirm is what I was an eyewitness to and what everybody knows.  I know that there were acts committed by the Interahamwe, other than what we are talking about now.  

Counsel, personally speaking, it is the very first time I am learning of this.  What I know is that the Interahamwe committed lots of barbaric acts and those Interahamwe had nothing to do with members of the RPA 
Q.	Witness, you just said that you will rely only on things you were eyewitness to.  Did you witness with your own eyes acts of barbarism committed by members of the Interahamwe? 
A.	But, Counsel, the Interahamwe committed lots of barbaric acts.  That is why I am here.  I talked about many barbaric acts committed by the Interahamwe from the 7th of April 1994 to the 3rd of July 1994 it was the Interahamwe who murdered the Tutsis.  I have talked about the barbaric acts of the Interahamwe, even during that period.  I believe I said this when answering the question put to me by Prosecution counsel. 
Q.	Witness, you are saying that you rely only on things you witnessed with your own eyes.  Now, let us together look at the part of your examination-in-chief focusing on military training.  Were you an eyewitness to the military training? 
A.	From what I can see, you are trying to put to me the answer I have given.  Regarding their training, I heard of them and, as I told you, my sources were dependable, but I never went to the training sites. 
Q.	When did you first hear of it? 
A.	The Prosecutor questioned me about it, and I answered, so this is the second time the same question has been put to me.  Do you want me to give the same answer?  Because I know that you have the answer to that question. 
Q.	Witness ALG, give the answer.  There are not specific (sic) answers? 
A.	If it is your end to delay proceedings, then I will move on.  I said that the first person to inform me of the military training was Préfet Tharcisse Renzaho, and I mentioned the circumstances under which he told us of the training, it was in 1993, early in the year, I would say in the month of March or up around late February. 
Q.	Witness, so, according to you, it was in February 1993 that you first heard of the military training, which you say took place at Gabiro (phonetic)? 
A.	That's right.  I believe I mentioned Gabiro, Bigogwe and perhaps Gako, that was the very first time when I heard of the training. 
Q.	Witness, let me read to you a passage of your additional statement, which was annexed to your guilty plea of 2004, 4058475 in French, and this is what you say in your statement of the ***************2004.  "Let me also mention in this connection that the Interahamwe reportedly underwent military training at Gabiro before the 7th of April 1994.  It was done in absolute secrecy, such that even myself I learnt of it only later on."  What comments do you have, Witness? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  When I drafted that statement I actually remembered subsequently that Renzaho had told us of it.  When that piece of information came to my mind, I recorded another statement in which I mentioned what Tharcisse Renzaho's role was during the genocides, and I did mention this point. 
Q.	Witness, in that same statement of *************2004, a few lines further down, you said, "The soldiers working in the Ministry of Defence and the Interahamwe who underwent the training can explain it better than me."  So, do you agree with me that you are not in a good position to talk about something which you did not witness but which you learnt of only at a time which you situate in different manners in your various statements? 
A.	Counsel, I think this is obvious.  I learned of the military training and I talked about it.  I do not see what you are blaming me for.  If I said people who participated can be better placed to talk about it than me, I said I got the information.  I also told you the circumstances under which that person gave us that information.  I told you that it was a secret and the préfet asked us not to leak that secret.  Up to January 1994, we did not leak that secret.  We kept it. 
Q.	So, Witness, on the ***************2004, when you state that it was carried out in absolute secrecy, actually, if I understand you properly, you were privy to that secret but you lied on the 
	****************2004.  
A.	Counsel, I do not believe I lied, because the trainings were kept a secret, but the people who had organised training sessions, as well as those who attended them, knew very well that everyone else, in fact, the majority, were not aware of what was going on.  It was only subsequently that that secret was leaked.
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I would like to move to tender the passage of the statement K0358475, statement of 
****************2004.  I do not have the English version, but I know that there is a Kinyarwanda version disclosed under number K0343072 to 3079 and it will be exhibited under seal, Mr. President, because it may have a bearing on the witness's identity.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, is there an English version?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't see an English translation among our documents.  I think we have it in French and Kinyarwanda.  

But I have a query for Mr. Weyl.  Is he offering the whole statement or just that one passage?  I'm not sure I heard him.
MR. WEYL:
For the moment, Mr. President, I want to tender only that page.  Certainly the other pages which I would like to tender, but that is when my cross-examination evolved and it would depend on when the need arises.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I'm a bit concerned about that application.  We have adopted what I thought was a procedure for this trial that the entire statements were coming into evidence where there was an allegation that there was a contradiction.  If we are going to go to a strict standard of only admitting a portion of the statement which is contradictory, then we are going to have to change the way we operate for the trial.  Either put the entire statement in or let us apply a consistent evidentiary standard all the way through.  So I have no objection to the statement going in, but if we are going to cut and piece it I think we need to review that for the rest of the trial.
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I, myself, am going to want to offer that entire statement during my cross-examination, so perhaps it would be better if the whole statement came in now.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, are you going to make it a (unintelligible) and enter the whole document?  
MR. WEYL:
As a matter of principle, I do not have any objection to Mr. Robinson's wish.  So, if Mr. Robinson wants to tender the whole document, it is excluded that I cannot make any objection, because I do not see anything in that document which may disturb me.  However, I thought I had another understanding of the way documents were put into evidence because I thought only those which had been discussed before your Trial Chamber, and which had been highlighted would be those to be tendered.  That is what I was told.  So, if I think at this stage I wanted to tender just a little portion I thought I was complying with the logic of the Chamber, but if Mr. Robinson wants to tender the whole document of which nothing is contrary to my theory, then I'm quite comfortable with that.  But perhaps I do not have the full copy before me.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, if you are using a document to show that a witness has made a prior inconsistent statement, the Chamber would normally prefer to have the whole document so they have an opportunity to see the complete context in which the comment was made.  So, basically, if we are to make a ruling on this matter, we would require that the whole document is presented when you are using a portion of it to demonstrate a prior inconsistency.  

Now, earlier you tendered a gross statement and we had a concern about whether that should have been tendered because you had not used those statements to show there had been an inconsistency, but we let it pass; but to us, the gravamen, the basic principle underlining which you put documents of that type into evidence -- you see the prior inconsistent statement of a witness is not evidence.  It is a prior inconsistency of a witness that is relevant to our assessment of his credibility, but we need to see the context in which the prior inconsistency was made for our evaluation of credibility.  So, if you would like us to rule, we would say that the entire document should be tendered at this stage.
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I understand your guidelines, which is almost like a ruling, and I'm going to comply.  But I have a memory of the same form of arguments we had during the admission of prior exhibits and I think it was XBM, if I am not mistaken.  And we had the same arguments to underscore when the Defence wants to refer to certain portions of the statement, it may decide to tender only those portions which are highlighted.  That was my understanding regarding the conclusion we had arrived at with regard to the testimony of Witness XBM, but, of course, I will defer to the Chamber's ruling.  If the Chamber wishes to have the complete statements, and I will make a determination only with regard to the paragraphs we have highlighted to place it in context, then I'm going to move to tender the complete document highlighting the elements on which I believe there are inconsistencies.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, what is the number, now?  This will come in under seal, as well.

MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, it is 5:32.  Do you want me to move on or do you want me to give you assurances so that you can enjoy the break under the best conditions?  I am afraid I may not be in a position to reassure you.  I do not want to spoil your evening, but I will continue my cross-examination tomorrow, I believe, for the better part of the morning.  I will move as fast as possible, bearing in mind the clarity and the shortness of the witness's answers.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll move to adjournment now.  

Mr. Witness it's 5:30.  This comes to the end of your testimony for today.  I remind you, as I've done on each adjournment, that you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  You are excused now and you may return tomorrow morning.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You'll have to wait on Mr. Issa.  I'm sorry.  You'll have to wait on Mr. Issa to assist you to leave the courtroom.
MR. MJUI:
Your Honour, page 224 and 225 of the book will be D. NG36  and the document PVK will be D. NG37.  Thank you.
(Exhibit No. D. NG36, admitted under seal)
(Exhibit No. D. NG37, admitted under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Yes we can take the adjournment now until tomorrow morning.
(Court adjourned at 1735H)
