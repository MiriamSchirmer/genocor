P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Trial Chamber III is now in session.  Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.  

Do the parties have any motions before we bring in the witness?  

Yes, Mr. Robinson? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  Thank you, Madam President.  I do have a motion with respect to the internal character of the conflict in Rwanda that I would like to make orally at this time.

Before I do, I just want to say that, for my part and Mr. Nzirorera's part, we are fully prepared to cooperate with this Court.  I take seriously the remarks that Judge Arrey made yesterday and that you made, Madam President.  And I want to assure you that we fully intend to cooperate with the Court in administering this case, consistent with the vigorous advocacy for our clients, which we must and will continue to maintain throughout the case.  So I just want to tell you that your message of yesterday has been received.  It is understood and we will do our best to see that these proceedings proceed with the respect and with the kind of expedition that is consistent with the rights of our clients. 

Now, the problem -- the issue in this motion is that it is an element of Count 7, the war crimes charge, a violation of Article 4, that there had been an armed internal conflict involved in Rwanda.  

My object in making this motion is to get a ruling on the issue of whether that element is open to be contested or whether we are precluded from introducing evidence to show that the conflict was, in fact, international in character -- for example, the participation of Uganda in arming and training the RPF -- and if your ruling is that we are so precluded, to be in a position to ask you to certify an appeal of that ruling, so that the matter in finally determined before the trial is concluded.  

You have made two rulings on this issue. The first is the ruling of the 26th of February of 2004, in which was a ruling on an request for certification to appeal our motion for inspection of materials relating to the assassination of President Habyarimana.  And in paragraph 9(ii) of that decision, you said that the responsibility for the assassination has no bearing on the characterisation as an internal or international conflict.  And you said that the internal nature of the conflict is uncontroversial in view of Security Council Resolution 955, which implements Article 4 into the Tribunal.  We couldn't appeal from that ruling because that was a ruling on certification to appeal itself, so no appeal from that decision was possible.  

The matter next came up in your decision on the Prosecutor's motion for judicial notice at 
paragraph 37 of the decision, dated the 30th of April 2004, and in that paragraph, you declined to take judicial notice of internal character of the conflict, referring to the decision of February 26th.  And I don't feel that it is appropriate for us to ask for a certification on appeal of that issue because you, in fact, ruled in our favour.   You declined to take judicial notice, and so I don't think that it would be appropriate to ask for an appeal of a decision that was in our favour.  

And so today, I am making a motion for the admission of evidence of the international character of the Rwandan conflict.  And my motion is that I be allowed to adduce evidence of the international character of the Rwandan conflict, both in cross-examination of the Prosecutor's witnesses and in our case in-chief as well, and specifically the involvement of the government of Uganda and other governments in this conflict.  

I think that if you rule that such evidence is admissible, then there would be no need to take the matter any further, and we can decide, on a witness-by-witness basis, what evidence you will hear and what you will not.  If you decide that such evidence is inadmissible, then I think we can proceed to ask for certification of that ruling for appeal.  So that is my motion for the admission of evidence of the international character of the Rwandan conflict.  And that is my best effort to put this issue in a posture in which it can be decided very clearly and appealed if necessary.  

I want to call your attention to a decision of the Appeals Chamber in Prosecutor v. Delalic.  It is 
No. 96-21A, on the 20th of February 2001, at paragraph 25.  The Appeals Chamber said that whether a conflict is internal or international is determined according to the evidence presented in each individual case.  That's a binding decision on this Trial Chamber, and in my view, clearly indicates that it would be wrong to preclude evidence of the international character of this conflict.  

In your ruling of the 26th of February, you said that by enacting Article 4 in the United Nations Resolution setting up the Tribunal, the Security Council made a determination that this was an internal conflict rather than an international one.  

I respectfully suggest that that is not a correct application of the law because in the ICTY, the same article was adopted by the Security Council Resolution, yet some of the conflicts in Bosnia-Croatia have been determined to be international in character, and, so, therefore, the fact that the Security Council made available a statute relating to an internal conflict is not a binding determination or a factual determination that a conflict in Rwanda was internal in nature.  

Secondly, I would like to point out that a resolution of the Security Council, a political body, cannot be a substitute for a judicial finding based upon evidence.  And as an example of that, I will call your attention to Resolution 1530 adopted by the Security Council on the 11th of March 2004, pertaining to the attack in Madrid on the trains that killed a number of people.  

And then the Security Council on the 11th of March, passed a resolution condemning the terrorist group ETA, for participating in this attack, and it has since been known that the attack was carried out by Al Qaeda and not by ETA.  So the Security Council, in adopting its resolutions, doesn't have the fact-finding capabilities or interests that you have as a judicial body, and you can't, in my submission, take a Security Council Resolution and turn it to a binding fact.  

So for all of those reasons, I ask that you grant my motion to allow to us to introduce evidence of the international character of the Rwandan conflict.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Roach. 
MR. ROACH:
Good morning, Your Honours.  I rise to support this motion, and it is also the position of 
Dr. Ngirumpatse that evidence be allowed in this case to indicate that the war in Rwanda between 1990 and 1994 was of an international character.  

And with respect to your decision that was rendered last Friday, I should say that there is some confusion amongst ourselves, but not among you maybe, as to the exact meaning of that.  And I know that this Chamber believes that that is -- it's very clear from the decision with respect to judicial notice, but we have some difficulty as to whether or not it may be used to preclude our introducing evidence on the international character of this war.  And so we have had some discussion.  

I am not completely ad idem on this point with my friend, Mr. Robinson, but the problem that I have is not that he is wrong but it may be necessary for us to still pursue our certification motion and that we are in the process of doing.  We will not be able to do that orally in Court because of the very technical nature of it, and we will not have it ready until the end of the day.  So we will be presenting that in writing.  If, on the other hand, a decision is made sometime today by this Chamber on Mr. Robinson's motion, but then it may obviate the necessity of our asking for certification with respect to an appeal of that decision.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. O'Shea.
MR. O'SHEA:
Madam President, I have quite a separate matter to raise, and I don't know if the Prosecution is intending to respond to these two matters which have just been raised or whether I should speak now.  
MS. MAKWAIA:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  With respect to the request by Counsel Robinson and Mr. Roach to have admitted, as part of the Defence case and during cross-examination of Prosecution witnesses, evidence that would tend to show the character of the conflict in Rwanda was international in character, Your Honours, these are our submissions.  

The jurisprudence at the ICTR, Your Honours, confirmed on appeal in the Akayesu case, the Rutaganda case, the Musema case, the Kayishema case, supports the theory or the allegation that was made by the Prosecution during those trials, that the armed conflict in Rwanda was not international in character.  

It our submission, Your Honours, that having such decisions, which were not reversed on appeal, this Trial Chamber is therefore bound by these decisions, that the armed conflict in Rwanda in 1994 was of a non-international character.  Therefore, Your Honours, it is our submission, to admit evidence intending to show that this character was international in nature, would be futile and a waste of the Court's time, going by this jurisprudence.  

Now, if Your Honours grant any of the counsels' certification to appeal, as indicated by Mr. Roach, the Prosecutor will also respond in writing to those briefs.  Those are initial submissions on the matter. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor.  

Mr. O'Shea, you have an application? 
MR. O'SHEA:
Not a motion, Madam President.  Madam President, Your Honours, we merely would like to put the Court, the Court Management and the parties on notice of two matters.  

Firstly, Your Honours would be aware that on the 27th of April, Mr. Hooper drew this Court's attention to the fact that the team for André Rwamakuba would be considering the issue of the relationship between the Judge President and Prosecution counsel, and would consider whether to put in a motion.  

We have carefully reviewed the legal authorities.  We have considered the entire factual context, all the developments which have followed, and, finally, the fact that we have a concern that the fairness of the trial may have been put in serious jeopardy.  Taking into account all of these matters, we feel it's our firm duty to put in a motion with regard to recusal or disqualification of the Judge President of this Trial Chamber.  I only put the Court and the Court Management and the parties on notice of that so that all are aware, because we are aware that motions have already been put in and we intend to put that motion tomorrow.  

The second matter is that on the 28th of April, we put in a motion with regard to Prosecution counsel.  That motion was replied to -- sorry, responded to on the 4th of May.  Again, we would like to put the Court, the Court Management and the parties on notice that we will be replying to that response.  Thank you, Madam President.  

Oh, one other matter.  It would appear that when we received our motion back from the Court Management in respect to Prosecution counsel, and our request in relation to that, that there was a page missing on our copy.  We don't know if the other parties also received a copy with one page missing, but we will perhaps address that with Court Management.  But just so that everybody is aware that there is a possibility that somebody may have received a copy with one page missing, because we did, page 3. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber has taken due note of the various motions and observations made by the parties.  We should now like to ask that the witness be ushered in. 
(Witness entered courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
      Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We would like to remind you that you are still under oath and Counsel Roach will continue his 
cross-examination. 
MR. ROACH:
Thank you, Madam President.
WITNESS GIT,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (Continued)
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	Sir, are you -- you told us that --
A.	Good morning.
Q.	And I wanted to know whether **************************** of Rwanda? 
A.	Yes, ********************* of Rwanda. 
Q.	Yes.  And with respect to the war of the 1990s, is it your understanding that the war began in 1990 and continued until 1994? 
A.	The war that began with the attack of the RPF Inkotanyi began in 1990.  It went to 1994. 
Q.	Yes.  And is it also your understanding that the Inkotanyi forces were comprised of fighters from Uganda, Burundi and other neighbouring countries? 
A.	There were Rwandans.  It is Rwandans who had sought refuge in these countries and who wished to return to their country of origin. 
Q.	I see.  Now, do you agree with the statement that these fighters came from those countries that I mentioned?  You said they were Rwandans, but they came from those countries to launch the attack.
A.	When they launched the attack, first of all, when they started the war -- I am not sure where they came from when they started the war. 
Q.	Yes.  Now, is it your understanding or have you got any knowledge that some of the Inkotanyi fighters were or had been officers or members of the Uganda army? 
A.	I don't know anything about it.  I have never been to Uganda. 
Q.	Very well.  On another matter, you told us that there was -- there were rallies of a political nature held in your district.  And my question to you with regard to that is:  Can you confirm that these rallies were ostensibly for reasons of forthcoming elections? 
A.	Since it was a period of war, some people during these rallies wanted elections to be organised, and others wished for the war to end.  Rather, they wanted negotiations to be instituted to end the war. 
Q.	Yes.  Now, you told us that it was your understanding that at these rallies in your district organised by the MDR, that they were to incite the killing of Tutsi persons.  That is what you told us, I believe.  And I wanted to understand what was your feeling with respect to your own safety prior to these meetings which you said were in 1993 and maybe shortly before and in 1994.  Did you feel safe before that? 
A.	My security was at risk.  I did indeed feel threatened in some way. 
Q.	But I am suggesting to you that you only felt threatened after April 6th or 7th of 1994, and not before then.
A.	No.  That is not true with the attack of 1990.  Since the beginning of the war in 1990, they began to arrest those that they referred to as Ibitso.  I was amongst those Ibitso and I was arrested, which is why I say that my safety was at risk.  
Q.	But can you confirm that there were no mass killings prior to April of 1994? 
A.	People were killed; even my uncle was killed in 1992. 
Q.	Can you confirm that there were no mass killings before April of 1994? 
A.	In regard to these mass killings, we used to hear these on the radio.  In my region, this was not the case.  But they went from region to region; they killed people depending on the regions.  Many people were not killed in my region but this was the case in other regions. 
Q.	Yes.  Witness, I want to direct you to the time period that I mentioned in my question.  And let me put this to you again.  Isn't it a fact, and can you confirm, that in your region, there were no mass killings before April of 1994?
JUDGE ARREY:
He has already answered, Counsel.  He said there were killings in other areas but there was none in his area. 
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	I am directing my mind to the date.  Can you confirm the date before that date?
MR. ROACH:
He did answer but my question is to pin down the date, specifically.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you -- you referred to April 1994 and you are mentioning it again, and he has answered. 
JUDGE ARREY:
He said '90 to '94. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Madam.
JUDGE ARREY:
You questioned him between the period '90 to '94; that is what we have.  I don't know whether you asked him directly on the specific date. 
MR. ROACH:
Yes, I said there were no mass killings before April of 1994 in his region, and he has not given me a response to that.  I want him to confirm that.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
He has already said this, but if you wish him to repeat this, that is another problem, because he even said that his uncle was killed in 1992, but that there were not many massacres before April 1994.  He repeated it.  And he repeated that it was in his region there were no massacres but there were in other regions. 
MR. ROACH:
Madam President, this is a scientific process of cross-examination, and although he may have given an answer that appears to this Court to be responsive to my question, I am not satisfied that he has confirmed that before.   And I am going to refer to the killing or the death of the president which would be April of 1994; before that, there were no mass killings.  He did mention, Madam President, that his uncle was killed, but I was not talking about individuals; I was talking about mass killings in his area.  And I should like, with the Court's permission, to have a clear answer to that question, and I should like, with your permission, madam, to put the question again to the witness. 
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Witness, can you confirm that there were no mass killings in your area until after the death of the president? 
A.	As I have already told you, in my region, people were not killed en masse but individuals were killed.  I gave you the example of my paternal uncle.  However, in other areas, I heard on the radio that people were being killed.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness adds, mass killings.
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Now, I would like to move on to something else.  You did mention that some parties were in the process of negotiating for peace.  And you have heard of the Arusha Talks or the Arusha Accords, have you? 
A.	After the advent of multipartyism, multipartyism was accepted.  There were opposition parties and it is these opposition parties who wished, most of all, for negotiations, and it is these negotiations that led to the Arusha Accords. 
Q.	Now, you say it is the opposition parties, but isn't a fact that it is also the MRND who were involved in the Arusha Accords, the MRND being the party of President Habyarimana? 
A.	Yes, the MRND was part of those who were involved in the negotiations during the Arusha Accords.
Q.	Yes.  And can you confirm, if you know, that a contingent or the contingent of RPF Armed Forces that were in Kigali was a result of the Arusha Accords? 
A.	Would you specify the period that you refer to, Counsel? 
Q.	In 1994, prior to the death of President Habyarimana.
A.	There were definitely RPF soldiers who were present in Arusha -- sorry, who were present in Kigali after the Arusha Accords.
Q.	And did you know or was it your understanding that they were there in order to protect the Tutsi population? 
A.	All I know is that they had come under the aegis of the Arusha Accords.  They came with the aim of protecting RPF authorities who had come to Kigali. 
Q.	Yes.  Just one other area, I believe, I will ask you to give some assistance on.  After the Inkotanyi RPF invasion of 1990, are you aware that a number of persons who lived in northern Rwanda were displaced and had moved to camps in the south of the country? 
A.	Yes, I am aware of this.
Q.	And are you aware also that after that RPF Inkotanyi attack, that the government of Rwanda at the time had embarked on a programme of civil defence? 
A.	I have no idea about this. 
Q.	Very well.  Those are all my questions. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Roach.  

Mr. Hooper, are you ready? 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, Madam President, thank you.  I have some very few questions that should be asked in closed session.  I apologise to the members of the public.  I doubt it will take more than ten minutes to deal with this closed session portion of the case.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objection?
MS. FALL:
No objection, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  

At the request of Mr. Hooper, we are going to have a closed session for the protection of the witness and in the interests of justice.
	(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 10 to 12] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 1 to 9 by Sithembiso Moyo)
























MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are in open session now, Counsel.  So you may proceed. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Your statement was taken on the 6th of November of '97 by investigators, including a man called Sidibe.  That may not be something that you recall but it appears on the face of your statement.  And would you be willing to take from me that that is the case, that that was the date of your statement and that was the name of one of the investigators who took your statement? 
A.	I do recall that it was in 1997 that that statement was taken.  I also recall the name Sidibe, as being one of the investigators.
Q.	Can you help us so as to how it was that those investigators happened to come to you?  Have you any idea of what took them to you? 
A.	I don't know. 
Q.	Do you know a man called Faustin Rutabagirwa? 
A.	Can you tell me his place of residence or his duties?  Because you know, in Rwanda many people may be bearing the same name.  Probably if you give me further details on the person, I'd probably -- maybe I can be able to tell you or identify him. 
Q.	Do you know many people called Faustin Rutabagirwa? 
A.	Yes, indeed.
Q.	Can I narrow it down to Faustin Rutabagirwa who was living in Gikomero?  Does that help you? 
A.	Are you saying he lived in Gikomero?  Is it the Gikomero secteur? 
Q.	Let me narrow it to a Faustin Rutabagirwa, the bourgmestre of Gikomero, from about July onwards? 
A.	Yes, if you are referring to one who was bourgmestre of the commune of Gikomero, I know him. 
Q.	Do you know him well? 
A.	Yes, I knew him very well. 
Q.	Prior to the war, had he been associated with Parti liberal? 
A.	Yes. 
(Page 13 by Sithembiso Moyo)









	1015H
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	In what position?
A.	He was the president of that party in the commune.
Q.	And knowing your situation, in respect of the party, you must have spent a lot of time together.  Would that be fair to say?
A.	Yes, that's correct.  We used to discuss party activities when we were together, and we would talk party activities.
Q.	Did he ever discuss with you the possibility of you giving evidence?
A.	No, we haven't discussed that.
Q.	Are you aware of Faustin Rutegara's ever collecting and presenting any facts or evidence relating to the events of the genocide in Gikomero?
A.	No.
Q.	Have you ever become aware of a report dated 1996, compiled by a genocide commission set up in Rwanda that reported on events, including events in Gikomero?
A.	No, I'm not aware of that report.
Q.	Are you or have you ever been a member of an organisation that assists survivors of genocide called Ibuka?
A.	Yes, I am a member of the Ibuka Association.
Q.	Are you aware of any reports that Ibuka has made or had access to concerning the events of genocide in your area?
A.	You seem to be referring to a person because I don't quite understand your question nor the person to whom you're referring.
Q.	Sorry if I'm not making myself clear.  It's my fault.  Let me put it again to you.  I'm asking you, as a member of that organisation, are you aware of any reports that it has made or any reports that it has had or received concerning the events of genocide in your area?
A.	Reports are drawn up by the representatives of that association at the district level.  As far as I'm concerned, I don't hold any position at district level; which means that I don't have any information on the reports in question.
Q.	So, let me conclude with this question.  Have you ever seen a report that names André Rwamakuba as one of those responsible, in any way, for killings or genocides in the Gikomero area?
A.	What I know, with respect to that man, is that I saw him.  All I know about him is from what I learned, but as concerns the reports I'm not aware of them.
Q.	Have you ever provided information, yourself, via Ibuka or in any other way, to any agency collecting such information, wherein you name André Rwamakuba as a party to the genocide events in Gikomero?
A.	At no time has a representative of Ibuka come to ask for information from me concerning the persons who played a role in the genocide commission in Rwanda.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, can I move on to a general matter very briefly, and if you can't help us, please say so.  In 1994 the commune of Gikomero composed a population of how many?  And before you answer that, can I exclude displaced persons.  So the normal population of Gikomero at that time, have you any idea how much it was?  Can you help us?
A.	I don't have any idea.
Q.	Can you help us, have you any idea as to what percentage of such population as there was, was Tutsi?
A.	Now, it is not easy to know the number of inhabitants of a commune, unless you are an employee in the commune or unless you had access to the communal register, to the census reports.  So I really can't tell.
Q.	And in your position in the party, which you've told us about, and I don't repeat because it may identify you, but your relatively elevated position in the party responsible for Gikomero, you didn't make any research or enquiry as to the nature of your constituency; would that be right?
A.	You see, there was a party, that is, true, but that doesn't mean you are going to carry out a population census based on the method that you have this or that position, which means that when you ask me for figures concerning a portion of the population I really can't give you an answer.  But I heard people say that you have at your disposal investigators that you can send to the field, and probably they can consult the records of the commune.
Q.	Yes, indeed.  I'm asking for your position, and I'm going to leave the subject with one final question.  Do you know, is it right that there was a census in 1991?
A.	Yes, I am aware there was a published census in 1991.
Q.	Can I move on to one general question about the MRND?  Is it correct that the MRND was the dominant party in your area?
A.	I cannot confirm it.  I never knew the number of members of the MRND party to know if the majority of the population have joined that party.  I didn't carry out any survey on that subject.
Q.	Would it be fair to say that you didn't display a very great interest in your area, in Gikomero?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That's a comment, Counsel.
MR. HOOPER:
Very well, I apologise.  I'll withdraw it.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can I move to the issue of the knowledge that you had of André Rwamakuba.  Would it be correct to say that your families, that is your family and the Rwamakuba family, through your father, through your grandfathers, were quite close?
A.	You talked about my father, my grandfather.  I never knew them, because by the time I was born those people were no longer alive.
Q.	Are you aware or can you confirm that your brother -- and by your brother I mean the brother that I suggested was in the MDR, I won't mention his name, and I appreciate you say he wasn't in that party, but the brother I refer to in that context -- is it right that he gave André Rwamakuba's father an ox in 1990?
A.	I am not aware of that.
Q.	Now, you say that you, over and above any family connection that there was, that you personally met André Rwamakuba.  And I want to ask you how many times that was.  You gave us a figure of going to the house, but I want to know how many times you actually met him.
A.	We met on several occasions, but to give you an estimate, I don't think we would have met for less than 15 times.
Q.	You described him yesterday, and this is my note, and though I now have a draft of yesterday's transcript I haven't had time to relate any of my questions to it because I only got it after nine o'clock, but I think my note is fair, and if not, it can be corrected later.  You described him as, "neither tall, nor short, or medium height, not very thin, not very dark, or very clear," at least that was the English as I heard it.  Can you help us any more in your description of him, as you remember him?
JUDGE ARREY:
Counsel Hooper, we have already said that description of Rwamakuba doesn't serve any purpose in this Court because we can't compare the evidence, the description with the person, so don't come back to that.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I submit, Madam Judge, you are wrong about that.  Because it will be possible -- first of all, it may be possible in the future to set eyes on him.  Secondly, you will receive, possibly, descriptions of Rwamakuba, if you don't set eyes on him, from others.  And there's other ways, there's photographs, video and the like, that you may become acquainted with his physique.  So I wouldn't preempt what will happen over the next few months about this.  I take your point that it hangs in the air until it can attach to facts that you can compare it with, but those facts may be forthcoming, so it is relevant, with respect, and with leave, I'll pursue this enquiry.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Would you describe him as a big man?
A.	But you have just read out a description I made of the man, I think.  I don't think I have anything to add to the description that I gave of that man.
Q.	Would you agree, for example, with the description that he was stout, for example?
A.	Well, I think the answer that I gave yesterday is satisfactory.  You can refer to that description, and that is the person that I described yesterday whose physique you just described awhile ago.
Q.	Well, I accept that, but I can ask you this question, and it's capable of an answer.  Would you describe him as stout?
A.	The description that I gave seems sufficient to me.  Please refer to that description, which, indeed, corresponds to the build of the person.  I have nothing to add to it.
Q.	Then I'll move on.  I suggest, despite your family connections, you must have very rarely met André Rwamakuba or had any association with him.
A.	I said that we used to meet one another during his vacation, for example, when he would come to visit his family or under other circumstances, during weddings or when there were unfortunate events striking the family.  I think that I gave ample information about that.
Q.	You referred to, for example, student meetings.  I wasn't clear what you meant by those student meetings.  Can you expand on that for me, please?
A.	When the students were on break they would organise meetings.  During those meetings they would invite the relatives, the parents, brothers and sisters.  Perhaps I can say it in French, they tried to help the students on break by giving them activities, inviting their brothers and sisters and parents.
Q.	I suggest André Rwamakuba never participated in anything like that.
A.	I know this.  I can tell you about the fact that in ***** there was a secondary school.  He often came there to hold meetings with the parents who had children as students in that school, and the school was called ETO. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness spoke of a school called ETO.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Those aren't the student meetings you've just talked about, and I'll come to the ETO Technique in just a moment.  There is 11 years difference between your ages, isn't there?
A.	I don't know how old he is.
Q.	Well, I've just told you.  There's 11 years difference between your ages.  Does that seem about right, from the man you know?
A.	I'm not in a position to confirm that.  Perhaps it's true.
Q.	By the time you completed your studies you told us about, which was, as I understand it, around 1979 or later, André Rwamakuba was really long gone, wasn't he, from any real connection with the commune?
A.	That's not true.  His parents, brothers and sisters were in that commune.  I don't know how you can say that he had no longer had any link to the commune.  That's not true.
Q.	Did you ever meet his wife?
A.	I did meet his wife.
Q.	You describe his position as director of health for Kigali rural; that is correct.  And when you were asked by the Prosecution about that you said that you weren't sure of the time, the length he had had that office, but as my note reads, he had held that duty for a long time.  That's your recollection, isn't it?
A.	No, I don't know how long he was in that position, but, as best I remember, he did remain there for a long time in that position.
Q.	If I put to you that he, in fact, held that position in 1992 only, would that be a surprise to you?
A.	Could you repeat the year to me, Counsel?  I didn't completely get it.
Q.	Ninety-two?
A.	That would surprise me.
Q.	And finally, on general matters in this area, you've mentioned the ETO, is that Ecole Technique Libra?
A.	It is.
Q.	Is it right that that school, free school for local children was, in fact, set up by the brothers of Rwamakuba and by Rwamakuba later?
A.	Yes, that school was, indeed, set up by one of Rwamakuba's brothers.  But from what I saw, in the absence of his brother, Rwamakuba, himself, would show up to deal with the school activities.
Q.	And I accept and it's right, is it not, he played a significant part in the running and development of that facility?
A.	I don't have any information regarding the administration of that school, no information whatsoever.  And so I can't specify for you what, exactly, that man's role was with respect to running that school.
Q.	I mean, that school had nothing to do with you.  That's the point, isn't it?
A.	As regards the running of the school, there was no relationship, whatsoever.  I had no link to that school.
Q.	But you may be in a position to answer this question.  Is it right that that school was free and open to help local children, whatever their ethnic origin?
A.	It was a free school which could enrol any student, but I can't spell out the admission criteria for you for that school.  I'm not aware of those.  But I do know that it was a free school.
Q.	I'll move on to another matter, and that is the events in April 1994, as they concern you.  Yesterday, I understand, because I wasn't present but I have a note, that you spoke of witnessing killings, yourself, in your area; is that correct?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	And did you leave on the 9th of April?
A.	I left.  I left that area on the 10th.
Q.	In your statement made in 1997 and only three years after those events, you say the genocide began on the 8th of April '94 in ***, "On the 9th of April 1994 I took refuge -- I took -- at Rutongo parish."  Given that that statement was made only three years after the events, is it, you think, more likely that would be true, that it was the 9th and not the 10th that you took refuge at Rutongo?
A.	Well, since I left at night, on the 9th in the night, I was able to go across to that place on the 10th.  In fact, I moved all night long, from the 9th to the 10th.
Q.	Well, just one question on that.  If the genocide, as your statement states, began on the 8th of April in *** secteur, where you lived, why hang about for a whole day before moving to safety?  Why not move on the 8th, at night, so as to arrive, as your statement says, on the 9th?
A.	Well, on that date, the 8th, I didn't know where to flee, unless I could go into the forest to find a hiding place.
Q.	Very well.  On whichever date it was, is it right that you headed for Jabana?
A.	No.
Q.	May I refer again to your statement of '97, where you say, "Following persistent threats from the Interahamwe, I headed for Jabana."  Can you explain how that appears in your signed statement?
A.	I said that I went to seek refuge in Rutongo, a place held by RPF forces.  Rutongo and Jabana are not linked at all.  When I left my area on the date I specified, I went to take refuge in Rutongo.
Q.	Let me finally just leave both those references together so that you have the context of them, because I dealt with them separately.  The genocide, it reads -- and just before, can I ask you one question?  When this statement was taken you were talking in French, weren't you, and explaining yourself in French to the investigator?  French was the language that was used?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And your position in Court today, you are and were happy to talk in French.  You're comfortable in French; is that right?
A.	I chose to testify in Kinyarwanda.  I'm more at ease in Kinyarwanda compared to French.
Q.	Well, with that in mind, let me just read what is written in your statement, which I remind you was later signed by you.  And the full context is this:  "The genocide began on the 8th of April 1994 in *** secteur.  On the 9th of April I took refuge at Rutongo parish.  Following persistent threats from the Interahamwe I headed for Jabana."  Now, having read that, in its fuller context, can you help us how that reference to going to Jabana is present?
A.	True.  I did go to Jabana, but from Rutongo, leaving from Rutongo.
Q.	Very well. 
A.	That is written down in the statement.
Q.	Very well.  That -- certainly that is an interpretation.  I accept that.  Whichever date it was, it states that you took refuge at Rutongo parish -- and you don't have in front of you but some of us do -- a map or plan, and is Rutongo parish to the northwest of ***?
A.	I know that Rutongo is a hill.  It neighbours with ***.  Between the two there's Nyabugogo river.  And Nyabugogo is spelled N-Y-A-B-U-G-O-G-O, Nyabugogo.
Q.	I'm not going to trouble you, at the present, with looking at the plan because I don't think I have an unmarked one, but it may be possible you can indicate later, on an unmarked plan, where it is.  The position is, from the high land of *** to get to Rutongo, which is both a parish and a commune.
MR. HOOPER:
May I point out at this time, Madam President, that if you do have the green plan, where it says "Rutongo" is in fact, nominating the commune and not the parish.  My understanding is that the parish is up towards the top of that map's relief.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And, Mr. Witness, for you to travel from *** to Rutongo, as you say, you have to descend from the hills of *** down to the valley floor and then ascend the neighbouring hill, which is part of Rutongo commune, thereby getting to Rutongo.
A.	You are speaking of Rutongo as a parish, and a commune.  I'm speaking of Rutongo the parish, true, you go down, you cross the Nyabugogo river, and then you go up to Rutongo parish.
Q.	Did you cross that river by a bridge or did you wade it?
A.	I went over the bridge.
Q.	Does that bridge have a name?
A.	No, to my knowledge it does not have a name.  Some people call it the Nyagisozi bridge, 
	N-Y-A-G-I-S-O-Z-I.  Others say Shika Kubwimana bridge, because that is someone who lived near that place.  Shika Kubwimana, K-U-B-W-I-M-A-N-A, so it was some others called it Kubwimana's bridge.
Q.	Just a small point before we leave it.  Would that be the same or different or don't you know to a bridge that can be called Nkubana bridge?
A.	Could you repeat the name for me, Counsel?
Q.	Certainly.
A.	Or can you spell it, perhaps?
Q.	I'll start again, N-K-U-B-A-N-A.
A.	No, it's not the same bridge.
Q.	Very well, let me move on because what I'm interested in fact to know is where did you first meet the RPF?
A.	I met the RPF at Rutongo parish.
Q.	Were they in force there?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And having reached the safety of Rutongo parish, and I'm right, am I, and the RPF position there -- okay, I'll start again. Let me put it again.  

Having reached the safety of RPF positions, at Rutongo parish, why did you then go or head toward Jabana?
A.	The RPF forces were passing through.  They were on the war front.  They moved on, fighting their adversaries.  We remained at the parish.  The soldiers left.  Thereafter Interahamwe found out about the refugees who were at the parish and they attacked the parish, and so we left and we fled.  That is why I went to Jabana.  I was fleeing the Interahamwe attacks.
Q.	And so, on this subject, you maintain that you were the subject of an Interahamwe attack that took place behind RPF lines; is that right?
A.	That is what happened to us at the place where we were.  That did take place.
Q.	And Jabana, is that further south towards Kigali?  Not south of Kigali, south towards Kigali, is it towards Kibuye and Rutongo parish?
A.	Jabana is a hill.  It's located in front of Rutongo.  Between the two hills there is a river called Mulindi, M-U-L-I-N-D-I, Mulindi.
Q.	Now, you told us yesterday that you would estimate, as I understand it, 120 people had been killed in your secteur.  May I ask you this:  Did you ever hear of anyone in your area, *********************** or Shanga, or elsewhere in Gikomero commune, having lost their lives because of being killed by RPF forces?
A.	No, I never heard of such a case.
Q.	Did you ever hear, for example, of any Interahamwe, for example, in your commune being killed by RPF?
A.	I know that Interahamwe carried out killings, but, to my knowledge, Interahamwe were not killed.  I do not know any Interahamwe who were killed.
Q.	In your statement you refer to you say this, "Naturally, between the 16th and 17th of April 1994, the RPF soldiers clashed with the Interahamwe.  I was not told how many victims there were."  Do you remember saying that in your statement?
A.	I did say that, but based on what I heard.  I was not a witness to these events.  So, the fact that this is reported information means that it would be best to ask the person who reported these events to me, so that this person would provide you with the clarification.
Q.	Do you know who it was who reported those events to you?
A.	The name of this person is in my statement, and I see that you have my statement in your possession.
Q.	Does his name start with a "V"?
A.	Yes.
Q.	I don't ask anymore questions in respect of that.  And I move on to another area entirely, which is the MDR.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How much time will you be needing, Mr. Hooper?
MR. HOOPER:
Well, as I said yesterday, I hope to finish by the end of the morning session.  It's greatly assisted me not being interrupted today.  I don't know why that is but --
MR. WEBSTER:
I can assure you it's not because some of your questions weren't objectionable.  We simply tried to expedite matters by letting it go.  Clearly, I believe, 30 percent of your questions asked would have given rise to an objection.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, maybe we can dispute that, but things go far more smoothly, I think we can all agree, with the degree of tolerance, if that is what is required from the Prosecution.  I don't concede tolerance was required, but there we are.  

So I think, Madam President, I'm not saying I will finish by lunchtime because I would be a hostage to fortune, but I hoped and I expect to.
MS. FALL:
Madam President, we hope so, too.  Madam President, I would like to ask Mr. Hooper who is referring to tolerance, to exercise this same tolerance towards us because we did not, in regard to your examination-in-chief, as Mr. Webster says, I did not wish to intervene because I did not wish to delay the proceedings.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are going to take a 15-minute break.  We shall resume in a little while.  We hope that you will conclude your cross-examination after that. 

Are there any other counsel who wish to cross-examine this witness after Mr. Hooper?  No.  Very well.  Court is adjourned for 15 minutes.  
	(Court recessed at 1107H to 1130H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is now in session.  Mr. Hooper, I recognise you.
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you, Madam President.  Before I propose another question to this witness, can I just clarify one matter.  The green map that I distributed a little while ago, which I know is only an aid and a sketch, but you had a later version than the copy I have here and I believe on that later version, on the area of hill, where the commune of Rutongo is, there is, in fact, indicated the approximate position of the parish of Rutongo in small print.  And on the Prosecution map, which I briefly refer to in Exhibit P. 3 at page K0276228, and I don't ask you to take a lot of time with that -- sorry to give way to my friend.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor.
MS. FALL: 
Madam President, simply we would like to have a confirmation.  Is he referring to the document that was presented by Counsel Hooper?  And we thought we had excluded it because it wasn't credible.  If that is the document he is referring to, I don't think he can come back here and refer to it once again.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
He's talking about the P. 3 exhibit.
MR. HOOPER:
First of all, the sketch map, which is a sketch and no more, and the map the Prosecution produced, which I'm not going to spend a lot of time on because you may need the help of a magnifying glass and several minutes, but Kibuye, Nyacyunga and Gabana are marked on that map and I only mention that should you, the Judges, seek to have those places better identified for your purposes.  And as far as we can see, Rutongo doesn't, in fact, appear on that map, and if it does, it is not legible.  So that's the position on the map.  Can I move on to --
MR. WEBSTER:
If I may interrupt, was counsel testifying or was counsel asking a question?  I'm not sure because it seems highly irregular that a defence counsel should explain the contents of an exhibit to the Court.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I have no difficulty in my jurisdiction, and nor do judges referring to maps and looking at them and this is to assist them.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you spoke a moment ago, before the adjournment, of your understandable, perhaps, reluctance to speak of any RPF killings, that you had only come to hear about because someone else told you about them.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor.
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I would like Counsel Hooper to simply say exactly what the witness said.  He never said that he was reluctant, he simply answered a clear question that was asked of him, and he never said he was reluctant.  So, I would like Counsel Hooper not to interpret the words of the witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Hooper.  Yes, you can proceed while avoiding the above.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	As I understand your evidence of MDR meetings, none of which you attended, any information you got, you got from other people and second-hand; is that right?
A.	I didn't participate in any of those rallies, I only saw people who used to take part in them.  I would see them when they were going there and when they were returning from those rallies.
Q.	Yes, I'll come to the specifics of those rallies in a moment.  Aside from that, did you read any MDR newspapers or get any information about the MDR in that way?
A.	I used to read newspapers; however, I couldn't tell if this or that newspaper belonged to the MDR or not.  I could see the names of journalists who used to write in the various papers, but I could not tell if those newspapers belonged to this or that party or organisation.
Q.	Can you give me the name of any newspaper that you read before April the 6th, 1994, where you read the MDR advocated the killing of Tutsis?
A.	There were many papers.  I cannot recall the names of certain newspapers, but I can give you a few names, in particular, Umurwarnshyaku, Kangura, and there were various articles in those papers and the various subjects that were dealt with.  So I could not tell you whether there were articles that dealt with the MDR, per se.  I can also add that the journalists didn't quite show their position, so what I can say is that there were many articles that were dealt with in those papers.  Umurwarnshyaku is spelt as follows, U-M-U-R-W-A-R-N-S-H-Y-A-K-A, Umurwarnshyaka.
Q.	And do you know on whose behalf that was published, which party it was published on behalf of?
A.	As I stated, the names of journalists used to appear in those papers and the names of the 
	editors-in-chief, as well, but I cannot tell you to which political party they belonged.
Q.	So, would I be right in suggesting to you that you cannot name any paper where you can say.  The MDR advocated killing Tutsis?
A.	I used to read articles that raised the awareness of Hutus, or sent Hutus to kill.  As I explained before, I do not know if those articles were related to the MDR.  I read such articles in those papers, but I could not tell what was the political leaning of the authors of the articles.  Only those journalists could tell what their positions were.
Q.	Now, can I ask you now, please, about the subject of the division of the MDR that you referred to in your evidence yesterday?  When do you say this division occurred?
A.	The split in the party took place in August 1993. 
Q.	Have you heard of an MDR meeting that took place at a place called Kabusunzu, and I'll spell that.  
	K-A-B-U-S-U-N-Z-U.
A.	As concerns that rally, I heard about it.
Q.	Did you ever come to hear of the motions that were passed at that rally?
A.	I do not recall the recommendations that emanated from that rally, because it has been quite awhile since that rally was held and I did not take part in it.
	(Pages 14 to 24 by Rex Lear)
















1145H
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Would it be fair to say, sir, that you know very little about the MDR?
A.	What I know with respect to the MDR is what I was able to see in our secteur with respect to the rallies that were organised there, so it is on the basis of what I know about those rallies, therefore, that you can ask me questions, but if you ask me questions about matters that took place out of our secteur, I can't know anything about it.  You can ask me questions that concern the events that occurred and that I saw in our secteur.
Q.	And does that answer extend to the MDR political position nationally, or if I put it in other words, is it fair to say that your knowledge of the MDR does not extend to what their political position was nationally?
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I would like to raise an objection, because that questioning -- about that questioning, because I think the witness has answered clearly because, with respect to MDR, he can only say what he knew of what was happening in his secteur, and any other thing that will be said on the subject will only be speculation on the part of Counsel Hooper.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Objection upheld.
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you.  So I, in fact, step over all my questions relating to the policies and politics of the MDR on the basis that it's something with which you cannot help this Court.  So I pass over the split and the rest of it.

Let me ask, though, about Hutu Power.  I don't know if there is an objection about me asking about this.  Before I go into this, does the Prosecutor consider Hutu Power something that is within this witness's ambit by way of questions? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I don't think you have to ask the Prosecutor if she agrees.  It is the Chamber that decides, not the Prosecutor.
MR. HOOPER:
I'm just letting the Prosecution know the area I'm going into is MDR Power, and whether there are any objections to my asking questions generally about that.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You ask your questions and then we will see if there are any objections.  You haven't asked any question yet.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	When did you first hear the word "Power" used in this sense of "MDR Power"?
A.	It was around the month of August, and I heard about it over the radio, and reports were made on what was said during a rally that took place in Kigali, and it's on that occasion that I heard for the first time the term "Power".
Q.	Thank you, and can you give us a bit more detail about this rally in Kigali?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, can you also tell us the year, because we heard the month of August but not the year?
THE WITNESS:
That was in August 1993.  With respect to your question, and as to what was said during those rallies and, as I told you a while ago, there was a small broadcast or report that was made on the rally, so this was like information that I got from the radio.  So I can't tell you exactly what was said, at least insofar as the details thereof were concerned, because the news broadcaster was very brief.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Was this a PA rally?
A.	No, it was a rally organised by the MDR.
Q.	Can you remember the names of any people who were said to be there?
A.	The radio talked about Freduald Karamira -- K-A-R-A-M-E-R-A --  M-I-R-A.
Q.	Do you recall if this was the situation, that that man, Freduald Karamira, was reported as having said words to the effect of, "MDR Power, PL Power, MRND Power, Hutu Power."  I'm not saying in that order, but that was the tenor of what he was saying.  Is that what you heard?
A.	Yes, those statements were made.
Q.	Would it surprise you to learn that that meeting where he said that was not in August, but in October, of '93?
A.	As I said, I stated that it was towards the month of August.  I wasn't specific.  Do understand that it's been quite some time ago, and therefore I cannot recall the exact month, and it was around that period of that year that I heard the name.
Q.	Very well, and I accept the difficulties of thinking back a decade, which is a strenuous memory test.  I recognise that, but may I jog your memory in another way to assist you, I hope?  Was this, in fact, a meeting that was held by all the parties as a joint meeting following the murder of President Ntaryamira of Burundi?
A.	As I have already explained to you, I merely heard that short radio broadcast over the airwaves and I didn't have any further information.  All that I have related to you is all that I heard during the radio broadcast, so therefore I have no more information concerning that meeting you are referring to.
Q.	Very well, and I move on.  But it was the first time, as you have told us, that you'd heard the word "Power" and "MDR Power", and it would follow, would it not, that any subsequent meetings, or any meetings, concerning MDR Power in your area would necessarily have to be after the introduction of that phrase, "Power."
A.	Yes, those rallies did take place.
Q.	I'll come back to those rallies in a moment.  Can I come now to what you might know in your commune of the MDR, and its structure and its personalities?  Are you in a position to help us as to the personalities and structure of the MDR in the commune of Gikomero prior to April '94?
A.	I wasn't a member of that party, but before the split of the party, as we can see from the written statement that I gave, the MDR was led by Anastase Gasana and by André Rwamakuba.  Those were the two leaders that I knew of that party.  After the split of the party, around the month of August and September 1993, Rwamakuba took the side of MDR Power, whereas Gasana remained in the other wing, which was qualified as the moderate wing.  Those are two leaders that I know to have been heading the MDR in the Gikomero commune.
Q.	Let's deal first with Anastase Gasana.  What position did he hold, do you know, in the MDR in the commune?
A.	When the party was not yet divided, when it hadn't split, in my opinion, he was the representative and the leader of the party in the Gikomero commune and Rwamakuba came after him.
Q.	Anastase Gasana was president, was he not, of the MDR in Gikomero commune?  Would you agree with that?
A.	I cannot confirm that, but it would appear to me that he was the highest ranking leader of that party.  I cannot confirm whether he was really the president or not, but I saw him at the head of the party.  I can't tell you who was the president and who was the vice president.  In any case, from what I saw, he was the person who used to organise the various activities of the party.
Q.	Now, you were in a certain position, which we've heard about and I don't mention because it will identify you, but an elevated position in your party in Gikomero, and the question I ask is this:  Given that position, are you saying you really do not know who the principal persons were and their positions in the opposition parties, or that you know very little about them in any event; is that your position?
A.	That is the reason wherefore I told you that when the MDR started taking shape, those were the people that I saw as the representatives of the MDR.  When they asked for authorisations to hold rallies, they are the ones who applied for those authorisations.  I really don't see how I can tell you if this or that person was the president or the vice president or the secretary of the party.  I used to see him, however, active in the party.
Q.	What position did André Rwamakuba have in the commune party of the MDR?
A.	I have already explained this to you, Counsel.  It appeared to me that he was Gasana's assistant before the split of the party, and it appeared to me that he was Gasana's assistant or deputy.
Q.	Have you heard of a man called Jean Marie Makombe?
A.	Yes, I know the name.  I've heard that name.
Q.	He was Gasana's brother-in-law; was he not?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And vice president of the MDR in Gikomero; was he not?
A.	Well, I don't know about that.
Q.	Let's correct that to secretary.  Alloys Munyangazu, spelt M-U-N-Y-A-N-G-A-Z-U; have you heard of him?
A.	Yes, I know that person.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(No interpretation)
MR. HOOPER:  
Sorry.  I put my French microphone on.  M-U-N-Y-A-N-G-A-Z-U.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Do you know that man?
A.	Yes, I know that person.
Q.	And was he vice president of the party for the MDR in your commune?
A.	As I have explained, I know all of the people that you have just mentioned.  They were all members the same party.  However, I can't tell you which one had which position or who had a different position.  The people -- the person I saw the most and seemed to be the leaders were Rwamakuba and Gasana.  The others were active in the party very well, but the leaders, to me, seemed to be Gasana and Rwamakuba.
Q.	And after you heard the word "Power" and "MDR Power", how often did you see André Rwamakuba?  How many times did you see him in the commune after that?
A.	I could see him arrive to hold meetings.  I saw him on several occasions.
Q.	Can you define "several", please?
A.	I don't remember very well, but at least five times.
Q.	Now, this man was director of health for a very large area in Rwanda, as you have told us, and a busy man.  When did he come up?  Was it during the week or weekends?
A.	Be it in the middle of the week or the weekend, he showed up when he wanted to.
Q.	And between first hearing of this word "Power" and the end of the year of '93, how often did you see him in that period?
A.	You will understand it's very difficult for me to give you a year and say, "In that year I saw him at such and such a time," or how many times.  It's difficult for me to speak in those terms.  I responded by saying that I saw him at least five times.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Hooper, let's please move on.  The witness has already answered your questions.  Now you are trying to sequence different periods.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	You say you saw Rwamakuba.  For example, the last time you saw him, you thought was towards the end of March.  That is what you told us.  When did you see him before then?  When was the last time you had seen him before that last visit that you remember and told us about?
A.	Yes, I saw him at the end of March.
JUDGE ARREY:
Counsel, I do not understand your question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please try to move more quickly, Mr. Hooper.  We have the feeling that we are losing time here.
MR. HOOPER: 
This is an important question.
JUDGE ARREY:
Yes, I was just saying that I have not understood your question.  When you say, "When is the last time you saw him before March?", I don't know what that means.  The witness is trying to answer.  I have not understood.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Witness, can I put the question again?  It's so much easier without interruptions.  I asked you, yesterday in your evidence you told us the last time you had seen Rwamakuba was sometime towards the end of March '94, and I'm asking you, Mr. Witness, when was the last time before then that you can remember seeing him?
MR. HOOPER: 
Does it really require an interruption?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor.
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I must object.  Counsel Hooper is asking the exact same question in a different manner.  Before he asked about 24th March and then before that, he said -- he asked, "How many times did you see him during that period?"  Consequently, the witness answered that he could not answer, but that he could say that he saw him five different times.  Mr. Hooper must either ask questions about specific periods, otherwise he cannot keep putting the same questions to which the witness has already given an answer.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I submit there is no substance in this objection.  It's a completely different and new answer (sic) and I'm asking it for a particular reason and I deserve the answer.  We've got a date: end of March; seen him.  I'm asking him when was the last time before then he thinks he saw him.  He can say, "I don't know"; he can tell us.  Let's please have the answer.  It would save a lot of time.
MS. FALL:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are going to move on.  At this pace we will never get out of this.  I will put the question to the witness, myself, please.  

Mr. Witness, you said that you saw André Rwamakuba for the last time in March, in March 1994.  Do you remember, Witness, when you saw him before that date?  And then we can move on with this matter.
THE WITNESS:
I remember that he came once.  He was in his vehicle.  He went up to his house.  I don't know if he only stayed at his parents' house.  This was in March.  In the evening, he went home.  That is all that I remember with regard to the month of March.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	That wasn't the President's question.  Accepting that view that you saw, and I don't go into that, when was the last time before then that you had seen him?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, answer this question, obviously, to the best of your memory.  If you cannot answer the question, just say so.  If you can remember, please tell us on which date you saw him prior to that last time.
THE WITNESS:
I saw him when he came to the rallies or when he would visit his family.  I can't tell you a specific time, a specific date when he came followed by another date.  I heard he would come to visit his family or he came for other reasons.
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you.  I have my answer.  I will come back to rallies, but I hope not to have to go into this again in much detail at all.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Let me move on to another matter.  If you were to organise a rally --
MR. HOOPER: 
Would Your Honour give me one moment.  I want to take a quick French lesson.  I won't be a second.

I was just trying to ensure that there is, indeed, that difference between the word "meeting" and "rally" in French, as there is in English, and I suspected there was.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So I'm talking about rallies, or you're talking about rallies.  Is it right that to have a rally, you had to give notice to the president of your party in the commune, who, in turn, had to notify the bourgmestre?  Is that correct?
A.	Yes, that was the case.  To hold a rally, you had to inform the communal authorities.
Q.	And indeed, you had to give two weeks' notice of that; is that right?
A.	Yes, per the instructions that were given to us, but I don't remember if it was spelt out in that manner unless I could revisit the instructions regarding organising of rallies by the parties.  If I had the document, I would be able to verify whether or not the authorities had to be notified before holding the rally, two weeks prior to holding the rally.
Q.	Yes, I understand that, and the document we are talking about would be a loi, would it not; a law?
A.	Yes, it was indeed a law governing political parties at that time.
Q.	And in having given notice of such a meeting, requesting the permission to hold a meeting, a record would be kept of that application and the decision; is that right?  I'm sorry.  Having given notice of the intention to hold a political rally, and having received permission, a record would be kept of that?
A.	Yes, it would be so with the normal administration.
Q.	And up until April, Anastas Gasana remained president of the MDR in the commune; is that not right?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, this witness said earlier that he did not know which position he exactly held within the party.  He said that he was simply among the leaders.  As such, for him, the two leaders were essentially Rwamakuba and Gasana.  He has already answered your question, Counsel.
MR. HOOPER:
I suggest there were not two leaders.  There was only one leader, and that was Gasana.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
He told us that Gasana was the first; Rwamakuba was next.  That is what we have all heard here, Counsel.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	In 1994, was Gasana, in fact, the minister for foreign affairs?
A.	I remember that he was a minister.  However, I don't know exactly which portfolio he had.  There were many ministers.  I cannot confirm if he was the minister of foreign affairs.  I only knew for a fact that he was still a minister, yes, but I mean this up until the 6th April 1994.  That is the period I'm referring to.
Q.	Indeed, and he remained a man of position and authority; is that right?
A.	Yes, he was a respected man.
Q.	Coming to the particular rallies that you spoke about, you spoke of ***********, and also Kayanga, and can you just confirm, is that the Kayanga that is between Rutongo and Gikomero secteur, or is it another place?
A.	Yes, Kayanga is between Gikomero and Rutongo.
Q.	How often did you visit, for example, Gikomero secteur?
A.	Which period are you referring to, Counsel?
Q.	Generally, over the years.  Would you go to Gikomero secteur?
A.	Yes, I used to go to Gikomero.  As I said before, **********   When I began my career, Gikoro and Gikomero communes only had one education director, and so when they wanted to meet, we would go to Gikomero to hold our meetings.  Furthermore, as part of my work, I would go to Gikomero and I would go there even after the war.
Q.	Let's return to the rallies, and you said, as my note has it, "Whenever there was a rally, he would come accompanied by people."  Can you just tell us how many rallies are you saying André Rwamakuba came to, and by that, in the context of MDR Power?
A.	I don't remember how many times the rallies took place.  I only remember the rallies in ********** ************************************** and Kayanga.
Q.	Let's deal with the *** rallies first.  You told us that they were held at a *** football stadium.  How many rallies were there concerning MDR Power that you recall André Rwamakuba attended?
A.	You've just mentioned the *** stadium.  I meant the secteur office in ***.  There were two rallies held in front of that secteur office in ***.
Q.	Can you help us as to when those were?
A.	They were held at different times.  I think one took place in 1993 and another in '94.  I don't remember the months when they were held.
Q.	Do they both concern MDR Power?
A.	Yes, they were chaired by André Rwamakuba.
Q.	Did you -- and that was something you heard from somebody else, was it?
A.	Yes.  I could see him go to the rallies, and I could see him return from them.
Q.	And that is in respect of both those rallies, is it?  You saw him coming and going?
A.	Yes.
Q.	You mentioned in your evidence a man called Kirenga, Arcade.  Would he be one of those who informed you about this?
A.	Kirenga was Rwamakuba's friend.  When we would chat, he would speak to Rwamakuba about the MDR party, about everything that happened, and when I spoke to him, he would tell me everything he spoke to Gasana about.  He had all the information about the party.
Q.	Arcade Kirenga, you refer in your statement to that man.  You described him as a trader at ***; is that correct?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. Hooper, there was a problem with the interpretation channels.  Could you please repeat your question?
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, certainly.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Arcade Kirenga, K-I-R-E-N-G-A, Arcade Kirenga you describe in your statement as someone who was a trader in ***; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that's what I said.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
The witness also added that Kirenga was Rwamakuba's friend, corrects the Kinyarwanda interpreter.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And in your statement you say -- of '97, this is -- of Kirenga, you say, "The latter is innocent, but could be a key witness with respect to the meetings organised by Dr. André Rwamakuba at *****."  Is that correct?
A.	Yes, that was my statement.
Q.	Moving now to the Kayanga meetings or meeting, how many meetings do you say André Rwamakuba held at Kayanga secteur?
A.	I'm aware of only one meeting or rally that was held at Kayanga.
Q.	Do you know when that was?
A.	I don't remember the month.
Q.	Was that another MDR Power meeting?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Turning to *****, how many meetings were held there concerning MDR Power and attended by André Rwamakuba?
A.	I think there were two rallies.
Q.	When were they?
A.	I don't remember the months, the dates.  I know they took place between the MDR split and the end of the month of March.
Q.	After these meetings, you explained how people would come in, stop off at your place, and tell you what had happened.  Were these MDR members, or not?
A.	Some could have been members of the MDR party.  Others weren't.  It would depend on each and every individual's choice.  When there were rallies, no one was prohibited from attending except people like me who couldn't go because of our ethnic background.  Otherwise, anyone in the population, any member of the population could go and find out what was said at a rally.  They were public.  They weren't held in secret.
Q.	After such a meeting, as I understand your evidence -- just give me one moment -- these people came and told you that, "We, the Tutsis, were going to be massacred."  Is that right?  That's what you heard. 
A.	Yes, I heard these words.
Q.	When was the first time you heard these words?
A.	I heard these words for the first time during the birth of the Power wing of the MDR at the time when, in public during rallies, it was begun to be said that the time of the Tutsis had come.  It is at this time that I heard these talked about.
Q.	But the words that you heard were words such as, "The Tutsi were to be exterminated; the Tutsis were going to be massacred," is that your evidence?
A.	Yes, that was reported to me.  This was said to me.
Q.	And you also heard this reported to you as being said at these rallies, these MDR rallies in Gikomero?
A.	Gikomero?  Where precisely in Gikomero, Counsel? 
Q.	Well, you tell us.  After which of these meetings did you first hear this as having been something that was said?
A.	First of all, there were people who used to return from meetings in general, rallies in general.  At the time when I saw them, when they were going to rallies or returning from rallies, they also said things, but it was not chiefly a question of what had been said during the rallies.  They, themselves, sang and danced to these words.  They shouted them and we could hear.  There were also people who attended rallies who explained to us what had been said, but it was not really a problem to find out what had been said during these rallies.
Q.	My question was, in the context of the rallies held in your commune, when did you first appreciate that words such as "extermination" and "massacre" were first being employed?  When was that?
A.	It is, indeed, during this period of the birth of the Power wing of the MDR party.  It is at that time when there was a split in the MDR party that I heard these words for the first time.
Q.	So you can't pinpoint it to the *** meeting, a Kayanga meeting, a ***** meeting, that you first heard it?  You can't help us and be more specific, or can you?
A.	At some point you asked me questions regarding newspapers and you asked me when I had heard this or that for the first time.  You know, I used to read the papers; I witnessed various events.  It is difficult for me to answer you regarding the very first time when I heard these words.
Q.	Was it not the case that this would be something so shocking that you would necessarily remember it?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
These questions, Counsel, you cannot ask the witness to be precise, to give you all the dates.  He has not told that you he took down everything that he saw about Rwamakuba in a diary.  Please let's make some progress.  As I said, we have the impression that we are going around in circles.
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, I am.  I'm on the hunt to make a point, that's my job, and I haven't been getting the answer that I'd like or want, but I'll move on, Madam President.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	When you first heard about this dreadful allegation, or dreadful threat to you, your loved ones, family, whenever it was, did you go and complain to anyone about it?
A.	As has been said on another occasion, it is not on this only occasion that I noted that the Tutsis were facing a situation in which they were persecuted, because there had been a previous period when Tutsis had been taken as accomplices.  That was in 1990, so for some time there had existed an atmosphere of insecurity for the Tutsis, and that was another new element, but it was not the first time that the Tutsis, as I had noticed, were not safe.
Q.	But there was a regime in place to control public meetings.  Did you not think to go to the authorities?
A.	Would you please repeat your question, Counsel, because I didn't hear it?
Q.	Very well.  There was a regime -- the question is, there was regime in place to regulate the holding of political rallies.  Hearing that such things were being said at political rallies, did you not make any complaint to any authority?
A.	At that time -- I told you that before rallies were organised, authorisation had to be sought from the authorities.  It was noted that this did not affect the powers at the time.  In fact, it seemed to me that the authorities, instead, supported these initiatives.  It seemed to me that these rallies which were organised were supported by the administration at the time, which means that it would not have produced a concrete result if I had gone to complain to these authorities.
Q.	Given your position in the PL, did you ever think of going to Gasana, Anastase, and complaining to him about it?
A.	Personally, when I saw the turn that events were taking, when it began to be said that Tutsis should be killed, I left my duties, that is my duties in my party, because there was a Power wing of the MDR which was associated with the MRND, and given the circumstances of the moment, I abandoned that position within my party for security reasons.
Q.	It's right to say that until Habyarimana's plane was shot down that the country was, in fact, heading for general elections; that's right, isn't it?
A.	What I know is that before President Habyarimana's plane was shot down, preparations were instead being made to implement the Arusha Accords.  That was the point at issue at that time.
Q.	And the Arusha Accords necessarily meant the eventual holding of general elections between the various parties; is that correct?
A.	What I know is that ways and means were being sought to implement the Arusha Accords.  As for the rest, I did not know what was to become of these institutions.  What I know about this, I have told you.
Q.	You said that before the 6th April '94, the MRND in your area, as I understand your evidence, held meetings, but the MDR could attend, and you also suggested, as I understand it, that the Interahamwe and the MDR youth were working together.  This before the 6th of April.  Is that your evidence?
A.	There is an aspect that has not been mentioned that I might provide here.  From the creation of the power wing of the MDR, the youth that supported the MDR Power ideology, since they shared the same ideology with MDR Power, they came together.  They joined rallies when a party organised rallies, for instance.  The other party would attend these rallies.  Regarding their collaboration up until the 6th April, that is what I know.  Even after the 6th April, during the massacres, they continued to work together to implement their intentions, that is, to exterminate people.  Their collaboration was before and even after the 6th April.
Q.	Before 6th April, did you attend any meetings where you saw the MDR youth and Interahamwe together?
A.	I have explained to you that I never did participate in a rally organised by the MDR.  However, I used to see people go to and return from these rallies, so people came together, they sang the same songs, and it was clear that they had the same designs and the same programme.  I was a witness to these facts.
Q.	Is it right, or within your knowledge, that from October 1993, political rallies were, in fact, banned in your commune?
A.	No, the holding of these rallies was not banned because they were, indeed, held.
Q.	I'm going to now put two or three meetings that I suggest did take place where André Rwamakuba attended, and I'm going to ask you if you know anything about them.  First of all, a meeting held in 
          *** in 1992, attended by André Rwamakuba, Anastase Gasana and Ubalijoro, who was or is an ambassador for Rwanda.  Do you remember that meeting?  Can I spell Ubalijoro?  
U-B-A-L-I-J-O-R-O. 
MS. FALL:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor.
MS. FALL: 
I would like to ask Mr. Hooper to be a lot more precise in his questions because he's referring to a rally of 1992.  He might perhaps give the period of 1992 so that the witness might answer.
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm just asking the witness as I'm asking the witness, and that is, "Do you remember a meeting in 1992 in *** where those personalities attended on behalf of the MDR?"
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I would like to repeat my request that for the witness to be able to answer 
Mr. Hooper's question more easily, he should give at least the month or the date, because '92 is very vague, indeed.
MR. HOOPER: 
Let me put the question like this, because it's much easier for the witness.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Do you remember any meeting in *** where those three personalities attended?
A.	I remember the holding of this particular rally.  However, I didn't attend the rally.
Q.	*****.  Do you remember a meeting there where André Rwamakuba attended, together with Aloys Munyangazu and Makombe?
A.	What year was that, Counsel? 
Q.	Ninety-two.
A.	I remember that rally.
Q.	Kayanga; May '93?
MS. FALL:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor. 

MS. FALL: 
Madam President, I would like to question the relevance of all these questions that Mr. Hooper is putting to the witness.
MR. HOOPER: 
These are meetings I say André Rwamakuba did attend, and no others.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please proceed.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Kayanga; May '93, attended by Anastase Gasana, and Faustin Twagiramungu, later prime minister of Rwanda under the RPF government.  Do you remember that meeting being held, May '93, and also attended by André Rwamakuba?
A.	I do not remember any such meeting being held.
Q.	Do you remember a meeting being held in August of '93, 14th of August '93, in Gishaka -- that is the site of the commune offices in the centre of Gikomero commune.  Do you remember a meeting being held there?
A.	Are you the referring to the 8th of what month, Counsel?  Please remind me of the date. 
Q.	It's August '93, 14 August 1993, Gishaka.  Gasana attended and André Rwamakuba attended.  Do you remember your friends telling you about that meeting?
A.	Are you referring to Gishaka secteur?  I do not believe I mentioned Gishaka secteur in my statement, which means that the places where the meetings were organised are the places that I indicated.  Apart from that, for other locations, I cannot confirm anything.  These meetings may have taken place at a time when I was not present in the area.  I cannot say anything about that.  I can, however, refer to the place or discuss the places that I mentioned in my statement.
Q.	I'm asking you about Gishaka and suggesting that it was by far the biggest meeting of the MDR held in the commune in '93.  Now, you have no knowledge of it; is that right?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
He has already answered the question.
MR. HOOPER:
Right.  I've got two shortish matters to do. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	The first one deals with you're listening to the radio, and your evidence, which I summarise.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, how long are these two points going to take you, because it's 1 p.m. now?
MR. HOOPER: 
I have it four minutes to, and I was hoping that I might carry the day by finishing by one.  Without interruptions this morning, I would have made it.  I've got probably another five minutes.

MR. WEBSTER:
I hesitate to interrupt because I'm also interrupting my own colleague when I stand up, but I'm a bit perturbed by the way the questioning is going now.  First of all, Counsel is going into facts that are not on the record.  How can you ask the witness does he remember a meeting where André -- you're asking two or three different points in the question, and the presupposition is that you're coming forward with evidence of these meetings, and that's not clear, so the whole line of questioning is improper.  So I hesitate to interrupt, because I do hesitate to interrupt my own colleague here, but this whole line of questioning is inappropriate.  

Secondly, there is no allegation in the indictment concerning these MDR meetings in 1992.  The whole thrust of the accusation is that there was a split in the MDR in 1993 and André Rwamakuba was part of Hutu Power wing of the party, so whether there were meetings of the MDR in 1992, and whether he attended the meetings, is irrelevant.  What is the pertinence?  It has absolutely no relevance for the issues we are dealing with in this trial.
MR. HOOPER: 
I don't know how many counsel are prosecuting at one time, but the position is this: I'm putting to this witness, as the rules dictate and allow, my case.  My case is that the dates I have put, as I hope I have made clear, are the only meetings essentially that André Rwamakuba attended.  I state, first of all, that there were such meetings and this witness has confirmed three meetings.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What is being said here is that reference is not made to these rallies either in the witness statements or the statement, nor in the indictment.  However, we have allowed you to put these questions.  Later, we shall evaluate the relevance of everything that has been said here.  At this time we shall ask you to try to wrap up within four minutes, Mr. Hooper.
MR. HOOPER: 
I won't be able to do it in four minutes.  I could have done it in four minutes four minutes ago, but I don't think I can do it in four minutes now.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I've come on to the allegation that you made, Mr. Witness?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No, listen.  You shouldn't toy with this Chamber.  You said that you had questions to put to the witness and you needed four to five minutes, so we will give you four to five minutes to conclude with the witness.  You, yourself, said this.  Nothing has changed since then. 
MR. HOOPER:
I'll do my best, but I can't guarantee I will finish in four or five minutes.  I said I hoped to have done it, and I said that if there hadn't been a number of interruptions, I could have done it, but the position is I've got two matters to put.  They are not very long either one much them.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	The first one concerns this, Mr. Witness, and I will take it as shortly as I can.  You said that between the 20th and 28th of April, on the radio, you heard André Rwamakuba speak; is that right?
A.	Yes, I heard this.  I heard him speak.
Q.	You heard his voice, did you?
A.	Yes, I heard his voice and I recognised it.  If you were to play his voice to me, I should be able to recognise it still.
Q.	Could that have been on 20th April, as indeed your evidence suggests it could?
A.	Since this is a long time ago, it is difficult to remember dates.  However, I might estimate the period during which I heard his voice.  It is the period that I indicated.  It is at that time that I heard his voice over the radio.
Q.	I dispute with you that anything that he said, said or implied, that there had been an extermination of the enemy or of Tutsis.  That's the issue I take with you.  You say he said words to the effect of, "The population had done their work by exterminating the enemy."  Do you know which radio station it was you were listening to?
A.	It was the national radio and RTLM which announced this news, and at a given time the two radios had the same editorial leanings, I would say.
Q.	Did you listen to it on both radio stations, or just one?
A.	At one point in time, Radio Rwanda and RTLM were broadcasting on the same frequencies.  It is as if the two radio stations were broadcasting on the same frequencies, and this is the time when I heard this news on the radio.
Q.	Well, that is challenged and not accepted.  

The last matter that I come to is, you gave the names of four people who could or can confirm your evidence.  They were Paul Karasi; Vuningoma, Augustin; Munyaneza; Gatanazi.  And those are all people you know; is that right?  Obviously.  Are they people that you spoke to or have spoken to since the war, or what's their position?
A.	Concerning these four persons, I mentioned them in my statement because they know Rwamakuba and they were his neighbours.  I can tell you that I met them in the house of Rwamakuba's parents and I saw them participate in these rallies, and they were witnesses to everything that was being done and they can therefore be cited as witnesses.
Q.	Do you know if any of those people have, indeed, made statements?  Is that anything within your knowledge?
A.	I know nothing about it.
Q.	My last question is this:  Did you know that a man called Eliezer Niyitegeka was government spokesman -- was the government spokesman?  You gave in a job to André Rwamakuba yesterday.
A.	Eliezer Niyitegeka was the minister of information in the Abatabazi government.  However, between the 20th and 28th, when Rwamakuba spoke on the radio, Eliezer Niyitegeka was on mission abroad.  That is why André Rwamakuba was spokesman for the government.  This was in the absence of Eliezer Niyitegeka.
Q.	Well, you've got that off pat, anyway.  I think those are all my questions, thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Madam Prosecutor, do you wish to re-examine the witness? 
MS. FALL:
Yes, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How much time will that take you? 
MS. FALL:
Perhaps 15 to 20 minutes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are going to take another 15 minutes.  We shall not, therefore, be in session this afternoon.  It will be best that way.  Please proceed.  

Do you have a problem, Mr. Hooper?  I see that you are standing up.
MR. HOOPER: 
Mainly that I omitted to ask, formally, the Prosecution to produce to me statements made by any persons nominated by this witness, and in particular Paul Karasi; Vuningoma, Augustin; Munyaneza and Gatanazi.  If the Prosecution is in possession of those statements, given the evidence that has been given, I would request that they be provided to the Defence and provided as soon as possible.  Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER:
Perhaps we should proceed with the re-cross and then we can take Mr. Hooper's application afterward, because I'm mystified under what basis he would ask for these statements.  If he is going an assume Rule 68 -- I don't know what the basis of the application is.  I've never heard in our procedure, but in any case, I'll give the floor to my colleague and we can discuss this at another time.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I recognise you, Madam Prosecutor.
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Madam President.  I had requested 15 to 20 minutes.  You've granted 15 to me and I would like to stay within that time limit.  If I go beyond 15 minutes, please don't hold it against me. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MS. FALL: 
I thank you, Madam President.  
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm going to take you back a few questions and I would like you to answer as concisely and quickly as possible.  I will take you back to a question that Counsel Hooper asked you, and even asked for authorisation to ask you a question concerning the Hutu Power, and ended up talking about the MDR Power.  The first questions is, do you know if there were links between Hutu Power and MDR Power?
A.	Yes, there were those links.  The MDR Power used to ask the Hutus to unify, to pool their forces in order to fight the Tutsis.  The fact, therefore, that the MDR mentioned the name Hutu, and that they were calling on the Hutu population to come together, I think on those grounds the links did exist.
Q.	Can you tell us what was the position of Hutu Power and MDR Power vis-a-vis the Arusha Accords?
A.	As concerns the Arusha Peace Accords, the Hutu Power and MDR Power were of the opinion that with the sharing of power, the Hutus were going to lose their benefits and advantages because power had to be shared between the Hutus and the Tutsi.  Accordingly, the MDR Power, as well as the other Power wings of the other political parties, came together, in particular the Hutu members of those parties, to fight the Arusha Accords which advocated power sharing.
Q.	You talked to us about a split over the MDR into the moderate MDR and MDR Power.  Was there any split in the party in which you were a member?
A.	Yes, that happened.  There were two factions.  The first faction was led by Justin Uganzi (phonetic), and that is a faction that was a PL Power.  The other wing of the PL that was a moderate was led by Landouald Ndasingwa, that is N-D --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I didn't get the spelling.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	And what were the duties of Landouald Ndasingwa?
A.	At that time Mr. Ndasingwa was the minister in the government that was led Ndindiliyamana, Augustin.
Q.	What became of Landauld Ndasingwa?
A.	He was killed.  He was killed on the 7th April 1994.
Q.	Do you know who killed him?
A.	Members of his family told me that he was killed by members of the Presidential Guard.
Q.	Witness GIT, much has been said about authorisations that you needed to acquire to organise rallies.  I have a question.  According to you, in your locality, who was the most influential figure?  In fact, to be specific, between Rwamakuba and the bourgmestre, who had the greatest authority?
A.	As concerns authorisations, the political party had to apply for authorisation from the administrative authority of the commune in order to organise a rally, but after the MDR split, Gasana led the moderate wing of the MDR and Rwamakuba led the power wing of the MDR, so much so that there was no longer any link or relationship between the two persons.
Q.	I will ask you another question.  Do you think that in your area, when these meetings were organised, did Rwamakuba require an authorisation?
MR. HOOPER: 
That's rather a leading question, to be frank.  I know we are all anxious to go and have lunch, but it really does lead the witness, doesn't it? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please proceed.
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Madam President.  Well, he didn't answer the question.  Was the question translated?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, can you repeat the question?
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness GIT, do you think that André Rwamakuba required any authorisation whatsoever to organise a rally in your locality?
A.	If I have to go by the collaboration that existed between the MRND and the local administration, the bourgmestre of the commune was a member of the MRND, and as I have told you, the MRND was supporting the MDR Power ideology and vice versa.  To me, therefore, even though Rwamakuba had to apply for authorisation, whether he got it or not, he could always hold his rally, since their ideologies were identical, if I may say so, and that there was collaboration between the two.
Q.	Witness GIT, you have been told several times that André Rwamakuba was older than you, and apparently, to you, you couldn't have any relationship with him.  I think that in your statement, and I will stand corrected, you told me that your knowledge of Rwamakuba, or your acquaintance with Rwamakuba was in two phases, once when you were a student in the Save school, and that you also met him during meetings where you met, but at that time you used to see him but you didn't have any direct contact with him; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Will you be specific to say that that's because he was older than you and that he used to go around with people of his age; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.  We belonged to a different age bracket.  We were younger than him and, therefore, I could not have any relationship with him whatsoever at that time.
Q.	Witness GIT, can you clarify this.  You talked about meetings and activities that were organised for the youth.  Can you describe the nature of those activities to us, if you can?
A.	There were student youth activities who were on holidays, and the activities were supported by their parents, their elders, as well as by neighbours.  Amongst other activities, we had games such as football, such as plays, so it was one way of bringing together students that were holidaying and it was within the framework of leisure and entertainment, so our elders used to provide us guidance that would support us and show us how we could better organise our activities.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you did state that -- or you testified that you didn't attend the rallies organised by André Rwamakuba, and all you know was reported back to you, and yet you made it clear that while those people were going to the meetings or were returning from meetings, you used to see them; is that correct?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	I would therefore ask the following question.  Witness GIT, who are those that you used to see going to attend the rallies?
A.	I can give you names of people who used to accompany Rwamakuba from Kigali.  Amongst them you had the MDR youth.  Others were Interahamwe who came to support him in those rallies.  Others were the inhabitants of that locality who used to attend the rallies.  They, therefore, associated with members of the MRND within the framework of the said rallies, so these are the various persons that I used to see attending the rallies.
Q.	Witness GIT, you have also been called upon to talk about the moments when the mass killings occurred in your secteur.  Could you tell us at what point in time those mass killings took place in your secteur?  Can you repeat that?
A.	The mass killings began on the 8th of April up until the 15th.  They occurred between those two dates, so the killings began on the 8th up until the 15th when they were halted, but I should say that the massacres continued on a day-to-day basis between those two dates that I just mentioned.
Q.	Witness GIT, did those massacres take place before or after the holding of the meetings that were organised by André Rwamakuba in your area or locality?
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm not sure what is meant by that question, because we know when this witness says André Rwamakuba held meetings, some time in the months subsequent to the Power meeting in Kigali, and the start of the April events on April the 6th.  We know that, so I'm not sure what this question is aimed at.  

The killings all took place, he told us, between the dates he told us, which is the 8th to the 15th, so how are we helped further? 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I am going to rephrase the question, if you will allow me.  These killings which took place between the 8th and the 15th, did they occur before the rallies that were organised by André Rwamakuba in your secteur?  Whatever the date, was it before or after?
A.	The killings took place after those rallies were organised.

MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I have no further questions, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very good.  Thank you.  

It would appear to me that this is the last witness that had to testify this week, so in principle we should -- the sitting on the 14th, that is Friday week.  However, we have a conference that will be organised for the Judges on the 14th, that is on Friday the 14th.  We are wondering if it were possible to sit in the afternoon rather than in the morning.  

Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm just waiting until you have finished speaking, Your Honour.  I'm not sure if one afternoon will be enough to complete the cross-examination of GIN.  My understanding is you are asking if we could sit in the afternoon of Friday 14th instead of the morning.  Excuse me one second.  

The consensus of the Prosecution team is that an afternoon should be sufficient.  

Independent of that, however, I wanted to bring to the Court's attention, and the parties', one or two points of information that might be useful in the weeks ahead concerning the testimony from 
Witness G.  

I had a conversation with one of my colleagues in the Office of the Prosecutor who will actually participate in questioning this witness.  

He informs me that the testimony will have to start at 10:30 in the morning because of the logistical arrangements that have been made with the Hague, so when it is either 8:30 or 9:30 in the Hague, it will be 10:30 here in Arusha, so we have to plan to start our session, to actually start the questioning at 10:30.  That doesn't mean we should not convene before 10:30.  Of course, within the discretion of the court, we can gather before 10:30 to address other matters, but the actual testimony with the witness can only start at 10:30 in the morning.  It will have to end at 5:30 our time, so the Court may have to consider whether we should take a shorter lunch break or how it would prefer to organise the session, but in terms of the live feed between the Hague and Arusha, it will be between 10:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. Arusha time.  

I also wanted to request a clarification.  Yesterday Mr. Robinson and Mr. Roach made some sort of representation about how they were going to share their responsibilities, and I'm not quite clear on the arrangement that they suggested.  

I understand that Mr. Robinson will go to the Hague, Mr. Roach will remain here, but I was operating under the assumption that all of the questioning for the Nzirorera defence would be conducted by 
Mr. Robinson from the Hague, and I don't know what status or role Mr Roach will play in the defence of Nzirorera, so if I could just have that clarification so that we could discuss it if it's not what I assumed it was. 
(Pages 25 to 45 by Trevor Gerbes)






























	1330H
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, if I can respond to that last point, I think I can simply clarify it.  What we are referring to is, actually, on your session on the 14th of May, I will not be present, and Mr. Roach has agreed to stand in for me for that session, and Mr. Nzirorero has also agreed to that.  So, other than that, I will be doing all the questioning with Mr. Nzirorero's team with respect to Witness G. 
MR. ROACH:
Yes, Madam President, I have, subject to the Court's approval, agreed with the Nzirorero team that I would stand in here.  I don't think that there would be very much for me to do except for the nominal situation, to say that he is represented down here.  But I must say that Mr. Robinson is not going to be representing us in his examination of Witness G.  I will be doing that from here. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well and good.  I think those clarifications were worth their while. 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, good afternoon.  I haven't taken the floor since this morning, so good afternoon, Your Honours, Madam President.  I heard Mr. Webster indicate that the afternoon of the 14th will be enough for the Prosecution team for Witness GIN.  

I think I would like to remind the Chamber that I still have to conduct the conclusion of my cross-examination, and the new -- or the additional allegations, as well as the cross-examination that will be carried out by the other parties on these additional evidence.  So I am wondering if the afternoon of the 14th will be enough for those various cross-examinations. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, that is all we have for now because the afternoon has been taken up already.  We definitely would have liked to sit for the whole day but that's impossible.  

With effect from the following Monday, we'll be with Witness G, so we would like to call on the parties to do everything possible in order not to retain us here for too long because, as you are aware, in principle, the Friday afternoon, people generally do not work, but we will be working here for the cross-examinations.  Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
In the spirit of Mr. Weyl's comments that I raised, initially because this witness will have to return to her home next week, and if there is concern on the part of the Defence that one afternoon is not enough, maybe we should meet on Thursday and start on Thursday so that we can be sure to finish by Friday.  It's -- you know, it's in the discretion of the Court, but this witness has been here in Arusha for almost three weeks now, I believe -- two-and-a-half weeks, and on Friday we will have to make arrangements to send her to her point of origin. 
MR. HOOPER:
Can I just, hopefully --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, there is no problem with that.  If you want it, we can sit on Thursday instead of Friday.  If this will be okay for the Defence.  We are ready to sit on Thursday instead of on Friday, and in that way we will have the entire day, if it became necessary.
MR. HOOPER:
I think I'd prefer Friday.  It's just that one has entered into certain arrangements that may be rather difficult to get out of.  In terms of the witness going home, I think it's home in a rather limited sense.  As we know, she is a prisoner in a Rwandese prison, and I expect the only difficulty is when the UN can take her back.  I wouldn't have thought it's a personal longing to be there rather than here.
MR. WEBSTER:
I mean, whatever her personal longings, they are of no concern to Mr. Hooper.  What I am stating, simply, is that we are making arrangements to send her to her point of origin at the end of next week, and it will be more convenient for all parties to dispense with her testimony by the end of next week.  Whether we start on Friday or Thursday is not an issue for us; we can start either one of those two days, but we would like her testimony to be completed by end of business on Friday.  

We will begin with Witness G on Monday morning.  We don't know how long that's going to take.  It would force us to keep this witness in Arusha possibly to the end of the month of May if we don't complete her testimony next Friday, so that's the concern.  So, Thursday is fine with us, if that's what Mr. Weyl prefers, because he is the one that made the observation and expressed his concern. 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, I think that the issue of the way in which once a time limit has been given you want to reduce it arises.  You talked about Friday.  We don't have to come back to that.  My wish, Madam President, is merely to be able to hope to have all the support of the Chamber to ensure that the answers of the witness are as concise as possible with regard to the questions that we will be asking.  We want concise -- we want concise questions to be asked and concise answers, and if the Chamber can compel the witness to act accordingly, I think my time for cross-examination will be very short.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We also like to call on the parties to have precise and clear questions so that the witness can answer as clearly and concisely as possible.  And, as counsel, we are trying to adapt ourselves, because that's where the problem lies.  Everything has been ironed out.

Now, we will be holding this seminar.  We, ourselves, we will no longer be able to hear those witnesses after Friday because we will be with another witness.  That has already been programmed.  So, insofar as the Hague is concerned, all the measures have been taken, and that is why we made that proposal which would assist in reducing that time period by a day only.  But if you do not want it, we will do everything on Friday afternoon.  

Fine, so we will be holding the cross-examinations or the hearing of that witness on Friday afternoon, and the Chamber, of course, will be proactive, if I can say so, to limit the interventions of the parties so that we can leave this courtroom in reasonable time.  Thank you.  We will see.  Very good, thank you.  

Counsel Hooper?
MR. HOOPER:
Very briefly, my investigator is still here.  I've put in a mission request for him to go to Rwanda to help me with the Kayanga matter as much as he can between now and next Friday.  Can I request, however informally, the support of the Chamber in assisting that application?  That is to say, if I can go, as you know, to the registry or that part of it that services this particular request, which is the lawyers section, Defence lawyers section, if I can go and say that the President has, for her part, or the Court, the Tribunal has, for its part, voiced support for the fact that there should be, if possible, investigations done or such investigations as are necessary between now and the limited time available between now and next Friday; if I can say that that's the position, then it gives me a little bit more muscle down there than I otherwise have.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, we will see what we'll be able to do.  We had already invited the registrar to help you in your investigations.  I think that the Prosecutor had said that he wanted to respond.  

Prosecutor, you said this morning that you wanted to respond to the motion that was filed by Counsel Sow and, I think, Counsel Robinson, I think, and Mr. Roach; but then Mr. Roach has said that he was going to file a written motion for certification, but he hasn't done so yet.  It would appear that Madam Makwaia said that the Prosecutor could file a written rebuttal after Mâitre Roach would have filed his motion.  Is that the case? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, I apologise I wasn't here this morning but I understand that my colleague, Ms. Makwaia, responded to Mr. Robinson, and her representation is that we respond in writing to Mr. Roach.  

With respect to Mr. Sow's application, very briefly, I'd state that I believe he was complaining about not receiving documents in French when the motion for judicial notice was filed.  But I know a French translation of that motion had been filed well in advance of the 28th of January, which is when the Court had extended an extension for he and his co-counsel to respond.  So, I don't believe he lodged an objection per se, I think he was simply commenting on his inability to respond to the motion objecting to the decision or raising the -- making the observation that the decision came out before a response from his Defence team.  

But all Accused should be aware that there are two working languages for the Tribunal, and they should make arrangements to be able to work in either English or French, and in respect of this motion, there was a French translation available at the time that a request for an extension was granted; and even with the extension, there was no response filed.  So there is no basis for Mr. Sow to object to the Court's decision.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Sow. 
MR. SOW:
Madam President, with your leave, I would like to point out that I received the Prosecutor's motion in French on the 20th of April.  On the 20th of April, we made a request through a motion we filed with the coordinator, who told us that it was not necessary for that motion to be filed because it was already available, the version was available.  

I have pointed out that at the end of March it was said that the French version was not available.  So what I am saying is very clear.  I received the motion in French on 20th of April, not in January.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we did understand that you wanted to explain to us why you had not filed any response before the Chamber made its decision.  Now, as to the extent possible, we are trying to avail the parties of the documents in all of the languages.  It's not always possible because the language section is completely overwhelmed.  Now, of course, for some documents, we require that the Accused has them in the language he understands.  

Very well, I believe that we have dealt with all the housekeeping matters.  We have understood that Counsel Sow had not filed a motion when he took the floor.  Is that -- that was correct, yes?  

Mr. Weyl, you had said something?
THE ACCUSED KAREMERA:
This is not possible.  I cannot accept that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You sit down.  You have Counsel who speaks on your behalf. 
THE ACCUSED KAREMERA:
This is impossible here.  I cannot accept what's going on here. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Sit down. 
THE ACCUSED KAREMERA:
Please give me time to express myself.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No.  Sit down.
THE ACCUSED KAREMERA:
Give me the time to consult with my attorney.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Your attorney is next to you; consult with him. 

Mr. Karemera, sit down.  

Yes, Mr. Weyl, please be brief, we need to finish. 
MR. WEYL:
Yes.  Madam President, still dealing with this issue of language.  For me, the motion for judicial notice was sufficiently important for the Accused to have that document in French.  

Another point that I wanted to deal with is that I did hear the Office of the Prosecutor indicate that the teams needed to be bilingual and then they could respond in the language that would be possible to use.  Now, such that the Rules allow this; these are provisions in the Rules.  If we can admit the Prosecutor needs to practice discipline, when they receive a motion in French, they need to respond in French.  When they receive a motion in English, they can respond if English so that we do not say that in the teams there need to be different responses in different languages.  

These are basic rules of courtesy between the parties so that we can at least work with the arguments that are put before us.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Indeed these language issues are very complex and we are not going to deal with these issues right here and now.  Everyone is suffering from the same problem, all of the parties and the Chamber, and we try to adapt to those problems.

Now, as regards the hearing of Friday.  I don't know if I said or not that we will begin at 3 p.m. because we are -- we have prior commitments in the morning and we can begin that hearing on the Friday, the 14th of May at 3 p.m.  

Counsel Sow, please be very brief.  I saw that you stood up. 
MR. SOW:
Yes, Madam President.

Madam President, I arrived here on 26th March.  Before my arrival, I had to work on motions regarding the preliminary motions just based on lack of jurisdiction.  Counsel Diagne underscored the fact that the indictment, the modified -- amended, rather, indictment, in French, was not disclosed to her at the time she made her applications.  Thereafter, after we filed our motions, we received on 29 March the amended indictment in the French version.  That means after we filed our motions.  Now, the same problem is happening here again.  The client -- our client cannot understand, and this has happened on two occasions that we are in this situation which causes us enormous prejudice.  That is why we are insisting, once again, that even if there are difficulties, we are insisting that the teams be placed in the same conditions so that they can adequately defend their interests.  

I refer to a decision that you had rendered in the Muhimana case.  In that decision, you gave the necessary directives for these problems to be dealt with.  I think that all of the parties respect your rulings and, if we did that, there would be no problems.  Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you, Counsel Sow.  

Please be very brief, Mr. Hooper.  And you will be the last speaker because at some point we are going to have to rest.  We are going to have to stop. 
MR. HOOPER:
I hadn't appreciated that we are not going to sit until 1500 on the Friday, and it may just seem perhaps an hour that is lost, but it is quite a significant time.  And, when you consider that we are going to have examination -- cross-examination by two counsel, one at large, as it were, and one on the Kayanga issue, you've got transcripts and all the troubles associated with those.  We know the witness and she's not the easiest witness, frankly, to deal with and doesn't give the shortest replies, whatever the length of the questions.  And I must say, if I am going to say it at all, I have to say it now, that I think we are going to be very pushed and uncomfortable to complete her evidence on Friday afternoon.  And for that reason, I move that we revert to your earlier suggestion, Madam President, that we sit Thursday and deal with it.  I should think it shouldn't take more than a morning, but it gives us that tolerance which otherwise we are going to lack.  And I'll certainly put aside any of my own personal interests in that respect.  It's not a problem. I prefer to sit Thursday, myself.  I think you were right, entirely. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We thank you, Counsel Hooper.  You have come to our rescue.  We will indeed, therefore, sit on Thursday nine o'clock in the morning.  This is a much better situation for us.  And since you are the lead Counsel, if you will, as regards this witness, we appreciate what you have said and, as such, we will sit Thursday 13 May at nine o'clock in the morning.  Thank you to all the parties.  Enjoy your lunch.  We will see you soon.  These proceedings are adjourned.
