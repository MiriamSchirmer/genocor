Defence Exhibit DNZ. 16....	37




P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The session is called to order.  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  

Mr. Robinson, are you ready for the rest of the cross-examination of this witness? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President.  I have two brief motions to present first, but I am ready to proceed with the cross-examination.  

My first motion is a motion for a trial de novo.  I know that motion has been made before on the grounds that the amended indictment should have resulted in a new trial, but my motion is on different grounds; it relates to disclosure.  

Yesterday, we received three CD-ROMS of a meeting in November of 1993 of the MRND, in which Mr. Nzirorera makes a speech and I believe, perhaps, also Mr. Ngirumpatse.  And I tell you that I can show you letters dating back from May of 2002, in which I have been requesting all of my client's statements and speeches from the Office of the Prosecutor.  

I am sure Mr. Webster will tell you that he just received this CD-ROM and provided it as soon as he received it, and so it is not necessarily an issue of fault on Mr. Webster's part.  It is an issue of fairness.  In the same vein, we received these tapes of the meeting of November 1992, that you have seen just this week, and I have been requesting that also since early 2002.  Both of these are also the subject of motions that I made for these materials starting back in September of 2002.  

Similarly, we are now receiving this week, for the first time, statements of witnesses made to the Rwandan government in the two boxes that Mr. Webster has described.  I have been asking for those statements since June of 2000.  They are the subject of motions and orders of the Trial Chamber dating back to September 2002, in which the Rwandan government was requested to provide that information.  

I will also tell you that there have been violations of Rule 66(A) (ii), that we receive all Prosecution witness statements 60 days before trial, is so pervasive in this case, that of the 80 witnesses that the Prosecution intends to call in this trial, this Rule was complied with for only one and not complied with for 79.  And so, for all of these -- so based on all of these circumstances, I am asking that we have a new trial and begin the trial over again,  because we are entitled to all of these materials before the trial, not to be receiving it in the middle of the trial.  

When I made my opening statement, I made it based on the information that we had at the time when we developed the strategy for the Defence case, that was based upon all the information we had before the trial started, and things have completely changed.  And so on that basis, I ask for a trial 
de novo.  

My second motion is for certification to appeal your decision on the preliminary Defence motion to dismiss the amended indictment for defects in form, that's a written decision in English that was rendered yesterday the 7th of April 2004.   

I simply wish to observe that pursuant to Rule 73(B), I believe that the specificity of the indictment is a matter which goes directly to the fairness of the trial, which is why these motions are brought before the trial and is supposed to be decided before the trial.  And secondly, that it would materially advance the case for the Appeals Chamber to decide whether or not the Defence has adequate notice in the indictment before the trial is concluded.  And on that basis, I would ask that you allow me to appeal your decision of 7th April.  That is all I have on the two motions.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Thanks.  We have gone over these disclosure issues before, Your Honour.  I will try to be brief.  

One thing I would like to make clear is that the Prosecutor is not conducting investigations for the Defence.  So, Mr. Robinson, with reference to his request for tapes of MRND meetings, we looked for those materials, of course.  But we look for them to make our own case in-chief.  We have no obligation to undertake investigations for the Defence and to go and search out these materials in Rwanda or elsewhere.  Whatever we have in our archives we serve on him or serve on the Defence pursuant to Rule 66 -- 66(B).  

So with respect to the videotape two, now that he is discussing, the videotape of the 15th of November 1992, which was entered into evidence in this trial, we served whatever materials we had; that was done on the 12th of March 1990 -- excuse me, 2004, just several weeks ago, but we served it as soon as we found it.  

The additional CD-ROMS came into our possession because our team made efforts to find additional materials.  And as soon as we found them, and we found them in order to make out our case in-chief, we served them on the Defence.  The same situation with the videotapes that were served yesterday, those concern an MRND meeting of the 7th of November 1993.  We did not do that to further 
Mr. Robinson's investigation or the Defence investigations.  We did that because we wanted to be complete in our presentation of this case.  And as soon as we have the materials, we serve them on the Defence.  So I think it misleads this Court to suggest that the Prosecutor has not been diligent in providing disclosure materials and that lack of diligence should lead to a mistrial or a trial de novo.  We serve the materials as soon as they come into our possession.  We have been making efforts and we will continue to do so until the close of the Prosecution case to bring the best possible evidence before this Tribunal.

With respect to the Rwandan witness statements, those also, we use our best efforts.  We were ordered by this Trial Chamber to use best efforts to secure these statements.  We did so.  Any Rwandan witness statements that we had in our archives were served on the Defence.  What we have served recently and we will continue to disclose during the course of next week, are statements that we obtained only last week.  We have no affirmative obligation to go and look for these materials simply to serve them on the Defence.  The witness statements that were served previous before commencing the trial are the witness statements that we are relying on to present our case.  

The Rwandan witness statements have nothing to do with the substance of the presentation of the Prosecution case.  Those are materials that the Defence can use for cross-examination purposes and to test the credibility of the witness, but they are not part of the case in-chief.  So, on that basis, there are no grounds for the motion for mistrial.  There is no disclosure of violation and, on that basis, I am submitting that the Defence motion should be dismissed.  

As for certification to appeal the recent decision, I, myself, haven't had an opportunity to read that decision yet.  I can reply more substantively if the Court requests that towards the end of the morning session -- so I would rather reserve my arguments on that so that I make an informed submission.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber has made the following decision:  There is no violation of the Rules by the Prosecution.  The Prosecutor has disclosed all the documents he intends to rely on, and he has also disclosed all documents requested by the Defence for the cross-examination.  Since these documents have been disclosed as -- and when the Prosecution receives them and submits to the Defence, such a situation cannot lead us to declaring a trial de novo.  

We believe, therefore, that we need to proceed with the trial.  Since we have already ruled on this matter and we said in our decision, that it was not in our opinion that the Prosecution should be responsible for investigations on behalf of the Defence, nonetheless, we asked the Prosecutor to make the necessary effort to assist the Defence teams in obtaining these documents.  

Now, with regard to the second motion, we shall make our decision -- we shall make our ruling known on that at a later date.  

Can you kindly usher in the witness, please, for the continuation of the cross-examination.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are reminded that you are still under oath, and Mr. Robinson will continue with his 
cross-examination.  

Mr. Robinson, you have the floor.
  MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.
WITNESS GFA,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, Muraho.
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	How are you?
A.	Very well, thank you.
Q.	I want to ask you some questions about what you said to the Prosecutor in Ruhengeri between the 3rd of April 1995 and the 24th of August 1998.  

First of all, is it true that you told him, "I was not an Interahamwe." 
A.	I was an Interahamwe. 
Q.	But did you tell the Prosecutor in Ruhengeri that you were not an Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes.  I told him that I was not an Interahamwe.  At that time the situation was very difficult.  At the time when we had been imprisoned, we avoided confession at all costs because we risked death since there was no established rule of law. 
Q.	And did you also tell the Prosecutor in Ruhengeri, "I never owned a gun"? 
A.	Yes, that is what I said to him. 
Q.	And that was a lie? 
A.	Yes.  The Inkotanyi were still angry when they were arresting us.  There were individuals who were dying under circumstances which have not been made known to date.  The situation was very difficult and it was necessary for me to lie.
Q.	Did you also tell the Prosecutor in Ruhengeri, "I was in hiding during the genocide?"
A.	Yes, I said that I was in hiding and I said that after the massacres I drove the Interahamwe vehicles.  These were lies which I was telling them in order to try and prove that I was not in favour of those violent acts.
Q.	And did you also tell them that Mr. Nzirorera's mother and members of her family wanted to kill you?
A.	Yes, I did say. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, do you have an objection?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'd just like to know what statement we are referring to.  Is this all in the statement of the 4th of 
April 1995?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, before we do that, we didn't even have the translation of the answer of the witness into the record before you recognised Mr. Webster's objection.  So please may we have the --
MR. WEBSTER:
I objected before the witness answered the question, with all the respect to the Court.  So I would like to know what statement you were referring to when you put this question to the witness. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I am referring to the statement of 8th June 1998.  So I didn't --
MR. WEBSTER:
If I may add, with all due respect to the Court.  When you ask a question, can you refer specifically to what statement you are basing your question on? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, I am sorry, but I didn't receive the translation of your answer to my question, so I am going to have to ask it again. 

Did you tell the Ruhengeri prosecutor that Mr. Nzirorera's mother and members of her family wanted to kill you?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, one moment.  It would be necessary for you to give us the code of the page that you are referring to.  

Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, do you have an objection to that question?
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Your Honour.  Before each question -- if counsel is bringing out a contradiction, kindly refer us to the statement and even with respect to the statement, refer us to where in the statement he is taking his information from.  I would like to also read along with counsel. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I am happy to do that and I would simply like to tell the Court that the statements are in Kinyarwanda only.  

So, if you Mr. Webster want to read along, I think you will need a dictionary.  But I am trying to do this as expeditiously as possible.  If the witness doesn't recall making the statement, I planned on showing him the statement in his language so I could get an accurate answer, but so far he's had a good memory of his statements.  But to assist Mr. Webster and his Kinyarwanda language people who are assisting him, I will, before I ask a question, tell him where he can find the reference to that question within the materials.  I have already done that with respect to this question which I will now ask again for the third time and which is contained in statement DNZ. 10, the statement of the 8th of June 1998, and specifically that can be found as the answer to the sixth question.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	I am sorry, Witness GFA, but I will once again ask you to repeat your answer to the question.  

Did you tell the Prosecutor in Ruhengeri that Mr. Nzirorera's mother and members of her family wanted to kill you? 
A.	Yes, that is what I said.  I said they were targeting my family. 
Q.	And now, I am going to refer to -- in my next question, materials contained in statement DNZ. 9, of 30th July 1997 and DNZ. 8 of 27th April 1995, and I ask you:  did you tell the Prosecutor in Ruhengeri that********************************************************? 
A.	Yes, ************************************************************************************************************** *******************************************************************************************************************
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
This is a correction from the booth.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And you told the Prosecutor that you were forced**************; correct? 
A.	Yes, he was the one who was the leader in our region.  You can read your documents and you will find that he was the leader of all the operations, and I was, ****************
Q.	Did you also tell the Prosecutor in Ruhengeri that you were not aware --  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me.  Before I ask you this question, I direct Mr. Webster's attention, and this is DNZ. 11 from statement of 24th August 1998. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Did you tell the Ruhengeri prosecutor that you were not aware that Interahamwe from Mukingo went to kill at the Court of Appeal? 
A.	I did say so, and the reason for that is quite clear.  I will respond to that question after the Judges' consultation.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All of these statements made by the witness are confidential, it would seem to me, and that is why you underscored the fact that these statements must be placed under seal, Counsel. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, the statements were placed under seal because they contain the identity of this witness.  What he told the Prosecutor in Ruhengeri, and I have been very careful in my questions to him about the substance of that, is not something that needs to be a secret and I have avoided any mention of sensitive names or any other things.  So I don't see any problem that this can all be discussed in open session, and I would ask the witness.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Witness GFA, if at any time you feel that your answer to my question --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
One moment.  Yes.  I am asking you the question:  do you believe that when he said that Nzirorera's************************, do you not believe that that can reveal his identity?
MR. ROBINSON:
No, Madam President.  I don't believe that that could have revealed his identity.  In fact, the testimony about Nzirorera's brother was elicited by the Prosecutor during the examination-in-chief in open session about Nzirorera's brother who was the leader of the group that he gave instructions; that doesn't reveal his identity.  Perhaps, he can ask the witness if he feel that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, but we also have that concern, even if the witness is not aware of that because we are the ones who issued the order for the protection of this witness.  I do, therefore, believe that it is different to say that the leader was a brother of Nzirorera, and to say that ********* the latter because the latter had asked him to do so; that is why.  If you cannot be more cautious, it would be better for us to move into a closed session so that we don't have or create any problems. 

Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
(Previous interpretation continued) -- the objection and it goes to the form of the questioning, because a few minutes ago, Mr. Robinson phrased this question by referring us to two witness statements at the same time.  And now that I review what has been marked as -- I am not sure.  I believe you said the statement of the 24th of August 1998 was one of the statements that you were referring the Court to, if I am not mistaken.  
Your question to the witness was if he was aware that Interahamwe from Mukingo went to the Court of Appeals and you elicited an answer.  You were going down the road of saying that he denied that, whereas in the statement itself, if we look to three-quarters of the way down in the English translation, it is a question:  "Are you aware or not that the Interahamwe went to kill at the Appeals Court?"  The answer is, "I heard of it."  So if we could lay the questions out with a bit more particularity, if you could restrict yourself to one statement at a time, then I think we would have a clear record on this.

So my request to the Court is that counsel be directed to direct -- to focus our attention on one witness statement at a time, that he directs us to where in the witness statement he perceives are contradictions so that we can be focused in this procedure.  DNZ. 11; that is, one of the statements that has been translated both into French and into English that we should be looking at the translations for that particular statement when we take questions on it. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The Prosecutor's objection is sustained.  

So, Mr. Robinson, can you make that effort?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President.

Can we place before the witness Exhibit DNZ. 11, and while we are doing that I simply want to explain to the Trial Chamber I was trying to move this along.  I don't mind showing him each and every statement, but try not to deduct this from my time. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Witness GFA, I am going to direct your attention to this statement of 24th August 1998.  Do you have the Kinyarwanda version in front of you? 
A.	I do.
Q.	If you look to where in the left-hand side there is the name Romanzi Bizimungu, I want you to read to us please the question that is just to the right of that name and your answer. 
A.	The question is the following:  "Did the Interahamwe come to kill at the Court of Appeals? "  I answered: "Yes, I heard that."
Q.	And could you read the next question and the next answer?
A.	"How did you hear about it?  Who told you that?"  

"I heard it on the radio.  I heard on the radio that Interahamwe had killed people at the Court of Appeals.  The radio announced that it was the Inkotanyi who had launched the attack and had killed people" -- but the population was saying that it was the Interahamwe from Ruhengeri who killed along with those people from Mukingo." 
Q.	And does that answer also say that you were not aware of that? 
A.	Yes, I said exactly what was written. 
Q.	And that was a lie, was it not?
A.	The text written in Kinyarwanda, I can explain what it means.  Yes, that document was written.  You can see the number on the document and it is different from my trial document.  The reasons I wrote this document do exist, but I can't tell you in open session.  If you want more explanations, I can do so but it has to be in a closed session.
Q.	Okay.  We may do that later, but for now, I just want to ask you:  did you tell the truth to the Ruhengeri prosecutor about your knowledge of the Interahamwe who went to kill at the 
Appeals Court? 
A.	Yesterday I explained why I did, what I did, and I have repeated it today.  In 1995 when we were arrested, we didn't want to confess what we did.  Those who arrested us were still angry, angry because their own had been killed.  So I did this to protect myself.  Even your clients can plead not guilty so long as the evidence against them hasn't been adduced.  I lied. I have proof of that.  I have accepted that.  You, yourself, can bring your evidence which shows that I lied but that wouldn't change anything.  I acknowledge that I lied and that is what I am trying to explain to you. 
Q.	And you lied between 1995 and 1998 to the Ruhengeri prosecutor, because it was in your interest at that time to do so; correct?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, can we move on?  The witness has already answered this question.  He has given more explanations on this just now.
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well, Madam President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, I would like to now discuss the Gacaca proceeding which we identified yesterday in the document that's labelled DNZ. 12.  And you said yesterday that you would like to explain about that document.  So I would now like to give you the opportunity to tell us of the circumstances in which that document was prepared. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecutor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yesterday, we had a problem with admitting this document because we didn't have the French translation.  I searched in my records; I do have the French translation.  It was served on the Defence attorney but, unfortunately, I have written on my copy and it is not something that is in -- as I find in archives, so the only clean copy that would be available to the Court would be coming from CMS.  And my question to the Court or the CMS through the Court is:  whether we have a clean copy of the French translation so that it can be provided to the Court and to the witness -- not the witness, but to the Court as we go through it as a preliminary matter, because there were a couple of documents that we had to find in order to enter them into evidence?  We had them marked and we were all in agreement that they would come into evidence, but I am wondering if the Court has received a clean copy of the French translation of this document. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have this document in French, indeed.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness GFA, would you like to explain to us the circumstances under which this document was prepared? 
A.	We were in prison, there were 47 of us.  Amongst us, we said we were going to look for ways for some of us to be released.  But amongst us, there were people who were accusing one another; they didn't agree.  So we said each one is going to tell a story and we were going to do what was possible so that some of us could go home.  So when we wrote the document, we didn't take into account a certain number of issues that I can elicit later; so we omitted some issues.  I don't know if I can mention the names of people, for example, in public.  But at any rate, the people who are on the list include some people who committed crimes and we didn't talk about that.  And there are others who never committed crimes or there are some who said they never committed crimes, but we know they did, they even pled guilty.  But in this document, we said that those people were innocent, for example.  But at one point in time, they confessed and pleaded guilty.  Nobody ever obligated us to write this document nor authorities made us do it, but we tried to get some of our colleagues to get home, to be able to go home because we were related to some of them or we had other reasons for wanting to do so, or some of us were friends, so we wanted to try and help each other.  

I could also add that as regards this document, I know that there are falsehoods in the document and so I didn't want to sign it.
Q.	And were you one of the people who were mentioned in the document?  Was it discussed in this document what you did? 
A.	At that time, we decided to sit outside, we weren't in prison.  We each gave our point of view.  As you will see, there are three categories.  Some said they committed crimes, some said they didn't, and others, we said they didn't commit crimes.  We knew we were going to be detained for a long time and so instead of living in prison, we decided that some of us should be released.  So I refused to sign this document.  I knew that I was running a few risks, that there would be consequences for me and so I refused to sign it. 
Q.	Within the content of this document, there are people who talk about what you are supposed to have done during the events of 1994; correct? 
A.	I said that there are people who know the truth, who know what happened, but each person said what he wanted to.  You could ask any of those people on the list who wrote the document and they will tell you that nobody made us write it.  We did it ourselves on our own volition. 
Q.	I understand that very well.  I think you made that very clear.  But item No. 40 on this list, which, for the reference of the Judges can be found at registry page 9156 and numbered D0000227, that is stamped on the page.  Under item No. 40, there is a category that relates to you; isn't that correct? 
A.	Yes, my name is written on this document, but I wasn't able to identify based on the information you gave.  On page 17, it is true there are categories established and it is on the next last page. 
Q.	But I want to direct your attention in the Kinyarwanda version to what I believe is page 10, and which has the number stamped at the top "00000246."  Do you have that in front of you? 
A.	Yes, I have identified the page. 
Q.	And on that page are entries that relate to you as No. 40 and then there are statements from people who talk about what you did, correct? 
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And, it is true, is it not, that none of these people said that you participated in the killing in 1994, correct? 
A.	Yes, that is what they were saying.  But in the current testimony, the testimony they are giving now, those who today have confessed and pled guilty, what they are saying today is greatly different from what is written here.  Today people are telling an entirely different story.  I think that some of those people may appear before this Court and you can verify yourself.  You'll see that what they will say greatly varies from what is written here.  What is interesting here in the document is that I was saying that I was not an Interahamwe; I was telling the prosecutor that.  But some people, here in the documents, said that I was an Interahamwe, and that is what I am confessing right here now; I was. 
Q.	Witness GFA, would you agree that not only did you lie about your involvement but your friends lied on your behalf? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, the question itself is completely acceptable, but it has been repeated three or four times now.  The witness has already said that.  How many times do we have to hear it for it to be recorded in the record?  He said that, he said that at least three or four times this morning. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness answered except for now you are adding friends who allegedly lied on his behalf.  

Witness, do you want to speak about that last part of the question, friends who lied on your behalf?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I had explained at the very beginning.  I said that each person testified in their own interest.  They testified according to their affinities.  They tried not to talk about those people who were going to stay in jail for a long time.  You will see that my name is listed.  If you look at all of this, you will see that some people dared to accuse me even before arriving before the court.  

Now, if you look through the statements of those people, they are more recent statements.  You will see even more serious testimony against me.  We were denying what we had done, but we didn't know that on the outside some people were going to accuse us.  When we began to give our testimony in the beginning, we decided to deny everything, but with time things changed.  Some of the witnesses had come back from exile and we knew that those people could testify against us.  So in the end we decided to tell the truth and that is why I am here before you now to tell you the truth.  I think that that is rather clear. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	But at the time that this document was created, you had gotten your friends to lie on your behalf, correct? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness already answered that question.  Move on, Counsel. 
THE WITNESS:
I think I already answered that question.  I know that my answers are recorded in the transcripts.  I don't see why I should repeat my answer.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	To conclude on this subject, would you agree that there was a kind of conspiracy amongst those in the prison to lie? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I am objecting to the question, Your Honour.  Conspiracy is a legal term involving the contents of this trial.  It is an inappropriate question, I am objecting. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Objection sustained.  

Counsel, can you move on to another question?  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, I now want to ask you about the events of the 7th of April and your activities.  So you have told us that you heard about the death of President Habyarimana in the very early morning hours of 7th April; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And at some point between 5:00 and 6:00 in the morning, you left your resident; is that correct? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	And you told us you went to drink tea at Byangabo centre; correct? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	And did you take a gun with you? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did you have any weapon with you when you left your resident on the morning of 7th April?
A.	I had no weapon when I left the house. 
Q.	Can you tell us the place that you went to drink the tea?  Is it on the same side of the tarmac road as the residence of Mr. Nzirorera's mother or is that on the opposite side of the tarmac road?
A.	It is on the other side.
Q.	Can you see the residence of Mr. Nzirorera's mother from the place where you were taking your tea? 
A.	Yes.  If you stand in front of the place where I was drinking tea, you can see the road that goes to Nzirorera's mother's house. 
Q.	And while you were taking your tea that morning, did you see Juvénal Kajelijeli arrive? 
A.	I saw him. 
Q.	And he was in a car?
A.	Yes.  He was in a red Hilux and on the side of it, it was written "Institute St. Joseph". 
Q.	Was he alone in that vehicle? 
A.	He was.
Q.	And was that vehicle travelling from the direction of Nkuli or from the direction of the Mukingo commune office? 
A.	The vehicle was coming from Nkuli, going towards Byangabo.
Q.	And do you remember approximately what time in the morning that this was? 
A.	It was on the same morning. 
Q.	But approximately, what time?
A.	At about the same time when I arrived at Byangabo, at about 6:30. 
Q.	And, where did you see that vehicle go? 
A.	It was going towards Nzirorera's mother's house.
Q.	So, did it turn down the small road leading to Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, did you also see Esdras Baheza arrive in the area in a car? 
A.	I also saw him and he was in a red Toyota Corolla.
Q.	Was he by himself? 
A.	He was also alone.
Q.	And, was he coming from the direction of Nkuli? 
A.	No, he had come from his house.  He wasn't coming from Nkuli.  It is in the same direction.  It is from Gisenyi and the road goes towards Ruhengeri.
Q.	And when did he arrive compared to Mr. Kajelijeli, before or after?
A.	He came a little bit later in relation to Kajelijeli. 
Q.	Did you also see Jean-Baptiste Nyabusore arrive?
A.	When Nyabusore arrived, I didn't see him come, but I saw his Peugeot 205.  I did not see him arrive, so I don't know exactly when he came.
Q.	And where did you see his car? 
A.	It was parked in front of Nzirorera's mother's house. 
Q.	And did you see anyone else arrive to Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house during the time that you were having your tea? 
A.	Those were the only people I saw arrive -- that I saw at Nzirorera's mother's house.  I didn't see anyone else. 
Q.	Now, did you, yourself, ever go to the area of Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house that morning, or did you remain at the place where you were having your tea?
A.	I went to Nzirorera's mother's house and there was one *************************************************** **********************************. 
Q.	******************************************************************************************************************** 
****************************************? 
A.	Yes.  Niyigaba also had come to have his tea. 
Q.	When you got to Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house, did you go inside, that's the actual dwelling, or did you stay in the compound area? 
A.	Yes.  We went into the compound.  When we got into the compound, we saw these personalities who were standing outside the house.
Q.	And those personalities were who? 
A.	He was Baheza, Kajelijeli, Nyabusore and Nzirorera's mother. 
Q.	Now, Witness GFA, I want to put it to you that Mr. Kajelijeli testified that he was not present at 
Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house on the morning of the 7th of April and, I anticipate, he will testify to that in this case.  Would you like to comment on that? 
A.	That is his own problem, if he made such a statement.  But I personally know that I saw him there.
Q.	And I put it to you that Mr. Nyabusore has indicated that he was in Kigali on the morning of the 7th 
of April and was not at Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house, and I expect him to so testify in this trial.  Do you have any comment on that? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I have an objection to the form of this question.  There is nothing on the trial record to indicate -- let me rephrase it.  I am concerned about a question that includes a representation of what the witness is going to say.  To me, it seems that the form is inappropriate, it seems improper to me, so I am objecting on that basis.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, if I may respond to that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may.
MR. ROBINSON:
This is a problem that Mr. Webster and I have discussed before.  I am trying to put my case to this witness, to be fair to this witness, to confront him with information that I am going to bring in my case, and that in good faith, as an officer of the Court, I am representing to you what I intend to produce.  

In fact, these are people who, I, myself, have personally met and spoken with them and verified this information.  Now in order to put my case to a witness, I, if necessary, must refer to material which is not in evidence because I don't have the opportunity to adduce evidence until the Prosecutor is finished.  

The information I am putting is not evidence.  If I don't bring these witnesses, there is nothing in evidence that you can use to rely on it.  But nevertheless, to put my question to the witness and put my case to the witness, I must, if necessary, provide some information to the witness.  And you are professional Judges, so you can make the distinction between what is evidence and what is the question that is not evidence.  I believe that I am entitled to and, in fact, required to do that.  And I read you the portion of the Kajelijeli judgment where they said they would take into account the fact that the Defence did not confront the witness with information it brought in its case.  So I ask you to please let me do my job and this is necessary for me to do it under the Rules, to put my case to the witness.
MR. WEBSTER:
I notice that Mr. Roach is on his feet.  So I was wondering whether he should respond first or whether I should. 
MR. ROACH:
Yes.  It is on the same point.  If I may, I should like to address the Chamber on this point because it is also my habit from long years of doing this kind of thing, to confront witnesses with alternative versions that I intend to present and, from time to time, I may be doing that myself.  So if we can have a definitive direction from the Court on this point, at this stage, it would guide me as well.  

I associate myself with the remarks as I said, and I hope that should this Court rule that we cannot confront the witness with proposed testimony that contradicts what he is saying, then I hope that in that event, it will not be held against us as it was in the case of Kajelijeli, that we had not done so when the witness was present.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper.
 MR. HOOPER:
For the Court's assistance, we support the contention made by Mr. Robinson, and dispute the contention made by the Prosecution.  There is assistance given by -- as to the basis of the argument that is the issue of putting a case.  At Rule 90(G) of the Rules; that is, Rule 90(G)(ii) -- and I don't want to talk over your discussion, so I will be silent. 
Madam President, I was referring you to Rule 90(G)(ii).  Mr. Robinson referred to observations made in the case of Kajelijeli.  Can I also support that by a brief paragraph?  It appears -- and it is one of a number, but it is just one I happen to have in hand; it is paragraph 268 of the judgment in Kamuhanda.
	(Pages 1 to 16 by Sithembiso Moyo)

































	1015H
MR. HOOPER: (continuing)
	It's one sentence and it reads as follows:  "Basic fairness requires that the Defence confront the witness with evidence that it intends to use to discredit her credibility." 

And so it's been formulated really as a duty on the Defence to confront a witness so that that witness can deal with evidence that it's reasonably anticipated by the Defence it's in a position to call. 

In my jurisdiction, for example, it is wrong to put to a witness that such and such a thing was said if you do not believe, at the time you make that statement, you're in a position to put that matter.  On the other hand, it is your duty to put to a witness matters of contention that, in the future, you believe yourself in a position to prove.  It's often done in the formula, "Is it right that you said X, Y or Z?"  And the witness can either admit it or deny it.  And that's really the position that is being put here.  What cannot be put in cross-examination, unless it's accepted, is a statement as a statement of fact in the case, as evidence in the case.  It only becomes evidence, obviously, if it's either accepted or later proved.  But the issue is one of confronting the witness with the issue so that the witness can fairly deal with it.  And it's quite borne out by the jurisprudence.  In my submission, that's the appropriate and fair way of dealing with it. 

Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel. 

Yes, Mr. Webster.
MR. WEBSTER:
Madam President, my objection was not to request a definitive ruling from the Court, a blanket ruling, as Mr. Robinson -- excuse me, Mr. Roach was suggesting, and it's not -- I don't think it's appropriate to make blanket rulings for objections such as -- there was a specific question that was asked by Mr. Robinson.  I made an objection to the form of that question, and the Court should be able to rule on that and any other question that I take an issue with.  I'm not questioning the principle of putting a case to the witness, but I believe Mr. Robinson's question is, "Well, if Mr. Nyabusore testifies that he was in Kigali, I put it" -- that to me is improper.  The witness testified to observing four or five individuals outside of the house.  At that point, Mr. Robinson could focus the witness's attention on Mr. Nyabusore and say, "Are you sure Mr. Nyabusore was there?"  But to bring in -- to import into his question evidence that he anticipates calling, in the person of Mr. Nyabusore, to me that seems improper.  So I'm objecting on that basis. 

I'm not asking for a blanket ruling from the Trial Chamber, but when we go question by question, the form of that particular question, to me, seems improper. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor? 
MR. WEBSTER:
(Previous translation continued) ... distinction between the first set of questions that Mr. Robinson asked along these lines and the second.  He starts out by saying, "Juvénal Kajelijeli testified in his case that he was not present.  I put it to you -- what do you say about Juvénal Kajelijeli's statement?"  There we have a transcript, there is something that we can refer to in order to confront the witness.  But to say, "Mr. Nyabusore will come as a witness, may come as a witness, and this is what he's going to say," that, to me, is not sufficient.  What happens six months from now when there is no Mr. Nyabusore that comes forward as a Defence witness to make this statement?  It's completely speculative.  The Defence can say anything and put anything to the witness.  There is no -- that, to me, is not a substantial offer of proof.  If you have a witness statement from Mr. Nyabusore and you want to file that, that would be another matter.  I see a distinction between the first question about Juvénal Kajelijeli and the second question about Nyabusore.  So that's the basis of my objection. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, may I respond to that, if necessary? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, the distinction that Mr. Webster makes cannot be the basis for deciding how you or when you can put your Defence case to a witness.  It's only by fortuity that Mr. Kajelijeli's trial occurred before this one and so we have his testimony.  There should be no distinction whether someone has testified in another case or they provided information.  I emphasise again, if Mr. Nyabusore does not come and testify, you can totally disregard my question.  If he comes and testifies, at least this witness has had the opportunity to comment on that evidence.  So there is no harm either way by allowing the question.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we indeed believe that there are two things.  You can indeed challenge this witness with contradictions which you have found, as you've done with Kajelijeli, but we do indeed believe that you cannot say, "This witness is going to come in order to contradict what you have said."  There is a difference between these two methods.  So we are asking you to bear this in mind, and if you have statements which would -- what the witness is saying, there is no problem there.  You could bring them out and say -- ask the witness what he thinks, but avoid telling him to say that "someone will come here to testify to the contrary of what you're saying."  Avoid that, please. 

So we do sustain a part of the objection of the Prosecutor because he was -- he did respond in relation to Kajelijeli, but with regard to Nyabusore, please put your question to the witness in a different manner, if you wish to persist in that line of questioning. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, if Mr. Nyabusore were to come and testify that he was in Kigali on the morning of the 7th of April, and was not at the house of Mr. Nzirorera's mother, what would be your comment to that? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm still going to object, Your Honour.  To me, it seems the same.  It's basically the same question.  It's a bit more refined.  I think the more appropriate thing to say, "If there was evidence that established that Mr. Nyabusore was not there, how would you respond to that?"  But to say -- I mean, it is confronting this witness with a specific witness that's -- it's implying to the Court evidence that -- we have no knowledge of whether there is any substance to that allegation.  So I think that the more appropriate formulation would be, "If there was evidence to the contrary, what would you say?"  And then at a later time, when the Defence brings forward its witness, we see how that -- how things develop. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. Robinson, do you have anything else to add or do you prefer to stick with the Prosecutor's proposal? 
MR. ROBINSON:
No, Madam President, I don't believe the Prosecutor's proposal is acceptable, because it does not allow me to confront this witness with the specific evidence that he -- that is going to be brought by the Defence, and so it is necessary to refer to a particular individual.  It's useless for me to say -- confront him by saying, "Are you sure?" or, "We have evidence to the contrary."  I have evidence to the contrary for many, many things.  It doesn't give him a witness -- it doesn't give the witness an opportunity to explain the particular evidence, the particular case, that will be brought by the Defence, and that's the purpose of this Rule.  I want to give this witness a very fair, a very clear, opportunity to confront the evidence that I will be bringing, and by simply making a blanket statement that there is evidence to the contrary adds nothing. 

And Madam President, I would ask, if you sustain the Prosecutor's objection, perhaps you could give me an idea of what question I could ask to this witness that would be acceptable to the Trial Chamber, because if I don't do it this way, I'm completely lost as to how to proceed and to preserve my record both for this Court and for the Appeals Chamber. 
JUDGE ARREY:
Mr. Robinson and all your other common law lawyers, I know that under jurisdiction in the common law procedure, you can confront the witness with statements that are contradictory.  If you want to also lay a foundation to show that what he's saying is not right, all you can ask is, "Would you be surprised?"  That's usually the formula we use in common law.  "Would you be surprised to hear that X has said that he wasn't at this particular spot at that time?"  So perhaps if you follow that, the Court can accept that.  But if you're trying to make a statement that X is going to come and say that he was -- that is a different proposition.  So put the question to him, "Would you be surprised to hear that this person said he wasn't available at this time when you said he was?"  Then go ahead.  That's the procedure all of us know. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Judge Arrey, and I will do exactly that. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, GFA, would you be surprised if Mr. Nyabusore were to say that he was in Kigali on the morning of 7 April 1994 and was not at the residence of Mr. Nzirorera's mother? 
A.	All I know is that Nyabusore is lying.  I'm not the only one who saw him there.  Many people saw him there.  And I know that I'm not the only witness here.  Even witnesses who are going to come after me could be questioned on this point, and they can confirm.  I know that on the 7th of April 1994, Nyabusore was indeed in Busogo, and I can confirm that.  I am certain of that.  Furthermore, Nyabusore, just like Nzirorera and Kajelijeli, are the persons who planned the genocide.  They are the ones who forced us to commit the crimes that we did.  If you wish to work for justice, you need to ensure that they come here before the Tribunal, and we are ready to lay charges upon them.  They are killers like anyone else, so they cannot speak on behalf of their colleagues. 
Q.	Is there something about being a killer that disqualifies a person from being a witness? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, can you move on to another question?  I have stopped the witness and I think you can proceed. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, would you be surprised if Mr. Baheza were to indicate that he was not at the house of Mr. Nzirorera's mother on the morning of the 7th of April?
A.	Yes.  That would surprise me indeed, because I saw him there.  I don't know why he continues to insist that he wasn't there.
Q.	And Witness GFA, would you be surprised to learn that Michel Niyigaba has testified and will declare that he was not at the house of Mr. Nzirorera's mother on the morning of 7 April? 
A.	Yes.  That would indeed surprise me, ****************************************************************
  ******* and he knew what his role in the MRND was.  So it would really indeed surprise me that he denies    having been at Nzirorera's mother's house.  Besides, there is a great deal of evidence.  He has testified a  great deal on this matter, and his testimony should be brought out to see exactly what he said on this matter.
Q.	Are you aware that he has been a witness before this Tribunal? 
A.	Yes.  I know that he has testified before this Tribunal.  But I know that he did not do so in this case.  He testified in the Kajelijeli trial.
Q.	Now, on the morning of the 7th of April --
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. Webster, do you have an objection? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster? 
MR. WEBSTER:
My concern is just the exposing the identity of witnesses.  I'm also concerned about Defence witnesses.  That witness testified as a protected witness in the Kajelijeli trial.  Your cross-examination has brought that out into the public domain.  So when we go down this road I think we should all be careful so that the identity of all witnesses are protected, including those that are going to testify for your client. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well.  Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	On the morning of the 7th of April, how long were you at the house of Mr. Nzirorera's mother? 
A.	I did go to Nzirorera's mother's house.
Q.	And how long did you remain there? 
A.	Perhaps only ten minutes.
Q.	And approximately what time of day was that?
A.	Before seven o'clock in the morning.
Q.	At any time that morning, did you see Mr. Nzirorera in Mukingo? 
A.	No.
Q.	Did you see Colonel Augustin Bizimungu?
A.	I didn't see him on that day.
Q.	And did you see Minister Casimir Bizimungu?
A.	I didn't see him on that day either.
Q.	Witness GFA, I'm going to read you a short statement, and I'd like you to tell me, to your knowledge, whether this is true or false.  And this is paragraph 33.7 of the amended indictment.  It says, "Joseph Nzirorera participated in decisions taken at a meeting at his mother's Busogo secteur residence on the evening of 6 April 1994 or the morning of 7 April 1994, or both.  Other participants at one or the other of those meetings were Casimir Bizimungu, Augustin Bizimungu and Juvénal Kajelijeli.  During the meeting that took place on or about the early morning of 7 April 1994, Joseph Nzirorera agreed with the other participants and ordered that Interahamwe militias and locally recruited armed civilians should attack and kill the Tutsi population in Mukingo and Nkuli communes." 

True or false? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I have an objection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting to the question, Your Honour.  There is no foundation.  The witness has already testified that he arrived at the house of Joseph Nzirorera's mother on -- around 6:30 in the morning.  There was no questions put to the witness about whether he was present at the house, the residence of Joseph Nzirorera's mother, the evening before.  To jump all the way to reading from the indictment is improper.  So there is no foundation for the question.  There has to be a whole series of questions before we get anywhere near asking the witness to respond to a statement taken from the indictment that has many different allegations in it.  It has to be broken down bit by bit by bit and the proper foundation has to be laid for it. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, my question to this witness is, as far as he knows, is the information contained in this paragraph of the indictment true or false?  If they bring other witnesses who say some of this is true, that's fine, but this is direct -- this is -- you couldn't have anything more direct to assist you in doing your job than having a witness tell you whether a paragraph in the indictment, as far as he knows, is true or false, because at the end of the day that's what you'll be doing.  So there should be no objection or problem with a witness stating, as far as he knows, whether something in the indictment is true or false. 
MR. WEBSTER:
My objection is that there is no foundation laid to establish that the witness is in a position to comment to a question like that.  An allegation in an indictment is put together on the basis of several -- information coming from several different sources.  So you're asking this witness to characterise an allegation based on information that's coming from the entirety of the witnesses that are being brought forth for the allegations in Ruhengeri.  So the question is improper. 

You can break that sentence in the indictment down into smaller bits and put that -- each bit to the witness, piece by piece by piece, but you can't read a whole paragraph and then ask the witness, "Is it true or not?" without laying the foundation that the witness had an opportunity to observe everything that's implied in that paragraph.  So the question is improper. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That objection is sustained. 

Please rephrase your question, Mr. Robinson. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, as far as you know, did Mr. Nzirorera, Casimir Bizimungu or Augustin Bizimungu participate in any meeting at the residence of Mr. Nzirorera's mother on the evening of the 6th or the morning of the 7th of April? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Even that question, Your Honour, I'm objecting to.  I would suggest that the more appropriate question to ask is:  "Did you see -- were you present at -- in the vicinity of the house of Nzirorera's mother on the evening of the 6th?  Did you see Bizimungu there?  Did you" -- you break it down person by person by person, but it's a complex question and you're asking the witness about his knowledge, not about his perceptions.  So the question is improper. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, can you tell us if you were at a meeting or if you noticed that there was a meeting being held on the 6th of April in the evening?  And can you tell us if those people who have just been named were at a meeting, if it took place? 
THE WITNESS:
On the 6th, I participated in no meeting whatsoever.  If a meeting was held, I'm not aware of it because I was not there.  I mentioned three people, Nyabusore, Baheza and Kajelijeli, and I said that I saw them at Nzirorera's mother's house and I also saw Nzirorera's mother.  I didn't see anyone else.  Now, if other people saw many more people on other occasions, those people have to tell you.  I did not spend the whole day there.  I was doing my own things on the 7th.  For example, I went to other places that I haven't mentioned.  And I can't tell you everything that happened there for that entire day. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, you may proceed. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, on the evening of the 6th of April, were you at home? 
A.	I was around.  I can't tell you if I was in my house, but I wasn't far away at any rate.  I was in my secteur. 
Q.	And when you heard the news of the president's death, you were in your house, correct? 
A.	Yes.  I was at home.
Q.	And did you hear or notice --
A.	It was at night when I heard.
Q.	And during that night, did you hear or notice any people arriving at Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house? 
A.	No.  I was at home.  I didn't leave the house.  And so I couldn't see whether or not people went to that location.
Q.	And by the early morning hours of the 7th of April, when you were at that location, you noticed that only the people you have mentioned were there, that being Kajelijeli, Nyabusore, Baheza, and Michel and yourself, correct? 
A.	Yes.  Those are the people who I saw outside.  I don't know if there were others inside the house.  I don't know.  Perhaps there were people seated or sleeping inside the house.  I only saw the people that I mentioned outside.
Q.	And did you see Colonel Setako at any time on the morning of the 7th of April? 
A.	I did not see him.
Q.	Did you see Jean Damascéne Niyoyita on the 7th of April? 
A.	Yes.  I did see him on that day.
Q.	And was that in the area of Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house? 
A.	No.  I saw him at Byangabo, in the afternoon, that is.
Q.	And what about the councillor, Asiel Ndisetse?  Did you see him on the morning of the 7th of April in the area of Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house? 
A.	I saw him in the morning, but that was in Byangabo, when he and others were killing a certain Rukara.
Q.	And so I take it that you did not see him in the area of Mr. Nzirorera's house -- Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house on the morning of the 7th of April, correct? 
A.	Byangabo isn't very far from Nzirorera's mother's house.  I don't know how you can ask that type of question.  If you can ask if he was exactly at her house, I can answer you exactly, but Byangabo and Nzirorera's mother's house are very nearby.
Q.	I understand that, Witness GFA, but I want to know -- do you have any reason to believe that Councillor Ndisetse was present at a meeting at Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house on the morning of the 7th of April? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting to the form of the question, "Do you have any?"  I think it's appropriate to ask the witness who he saw or what he was told, but, "Do you have reasons to believe?"  It's improper, Your Honour, and I'm objecting. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, could you rephrase your question? 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Did you see Mr. Ndisetse within the premises of Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house at any time on the morning of the 7th of April?   
A.	No, I didn't see him there.  I've already given the names of the people that I did see.  There are no others.
Q.	And so you didn't see Bourgmestre Harerimana at Mr. Nzirorera's residence, correct? 
A.	No.  I didn't even see him on that day.
Q.	And you didn't see Brigadier --
A.	On the 7th, that is to say.
Q.	And you didn't see Brigadier Ezechiel Bazimenyera at Mr. Nzirorera's mother's residence either, correct?
A.	I didn't see him there.
Q.	Now, can you tell us --
A.	And I told you that I spent only ten minutes there.
Q.	I want to read you briefly one sentence from the indictment and see if you could tell us if this is true.  It's paragraph 33.8.  It's a very narrow --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor? 
MR. WEBSTER:
(Previous translation continued) ... form of the question, Your Honour.  It's inappropriate to read the witness the indictment and then ask him to comment.  You ask the witness about the facts that he's supposed to know about and we move forward from there and you can make closing arguments on the indictment. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we've already answered a similar objection by the Prosecutor.  We would ask you to abstain from reading sentences in the indictment and then asking the witness to comment on them, whether or not he thinks statements are true or false.  Ask him questions, and we will make conclusions thereafter.
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President, my headset just went out. 

Thank you, Madam President.  I didn't get everything you said, but I take it that I'm supposed to reformulate my question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, the Chamber is asking you to not read paragraphs in the indictment and to thereafter ask the witness if statements are true or false.  Please put questions to the witness about what was said or about parts you want to shed light on, but refrain from asking the witness whether or not statements in the indictment are true or false. 

We would also like to draw your attention to the fact that on several occasions you've asked this witness if such and such a person was present at such and such a place.  The witness has already answered and told you all of the people that he saw and all of the people who were present outside the house.  And so we are losing lots of time with these types of questions, Mr. Robinson. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, do you know of a woman named Nyabuhu?
A.	Yes, I know her.
Q.	And is it true that she was already deceased before 6 April 1994? 
A.	Yes.  She died before that date.
Q.	And would it be true to say that Nyabuhu and a daughter that she bore for Joseph Nzirorera were among the first victims that were killed on the morning of the 7th of April? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I have no objection to going into this line of inquiry, Your Honour, but I think it's still reading from the indictment, and I would prefer -- and he's asking two or three different questions at the same time.  If we could take it bit by bit and if he could ask questions that are independently formulated rather than taking whole statements out of the indictment. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President, I made no reference to the indictment.  Of course, everything we are asking is supposed to be about what's in the indictment, and it's true that in the indictment it's alleged that Nyabuhu and her daughter were among the first victims killed that morning, but because it's in the indictment doesn't mean that I can't ask the witness about it.  I should be asking about the things that are in the indictment, so I think it's a very proper question. 
MR. WEBSTER:
My objection is that there is no foundation laid for that question.  This witness didn't testify to it in his direct examination.  That doesn't mean that you can't go into it, but it means that there has to be preliminary questions that are put to the witness to flesh out the factual record before we go into that specific question.  I believe this witness's testimony on direct was that it was Ngabire that was killed and that there were instructions to kill a child of Nzirorera.  So if we take it from there, and then you can flesh out the record and then go to the question of whether Nyabuhu and the daughter that she bore was killed.  So, I mean, I'm not objecting to the line of cross-examination.  All I'm suggesting is that the proper foundation has not been laid. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, can you spell Nyabuhu for -- for the Court? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, it's N-Y-A-B-U-H-U.  And I wonder if, perhaps to save time, Mr. Webster is willing to agree to strike that sentence from the indictment in paragraph 33.8, since we now know that Nyabuhu herself was already dead at the time of these events and that Mr. Nzirorera had no daughter from Nyabuhu.  So I can ask questions about this but I think even Mr. Webster knows by now that this allegation in the indictment is untrue and unfounded.  So I ask whether he's willing to strike it to save us all the time and embarrassment of this. 
MR. WEBSTER:
This is certainly not the time to argue about whether sentences from the indictment should be removed or not.  That's an application that should take place in a status conference when we don't have a witness on the stand.  All of the parties in this case have received two witness statements.  I won't identify the authors of those statements but it clearly spells out the inaccuracy of that particular allegation in the indictment.  I also responded in my answer to a motion for defects in the form of the indictment on this very issue.  So it should be clear to all of the parties because all the parties have the motions, have the answers to the motions, have all the disclosure in the case.  I think I've even gone too far in this response because it's not appropriate at this time.  This is something that can be dealt with in a status conference or when we don't have a witness on the stand.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The Prosecutor's objection is sustained. 

Mr. Robinson, you should file that concern through a written motion.  If you have any more questions, you may proceed up to eleven o'clock to finish this line of questioning. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	To your knowledge, did Nyabuhu have a daughter by Joseph Nzirorera?
A.	No.  Nyabuhu never had a child with Nzirorera.  It was another woman who had a child with Nzirorera.
Q.	Now, after the -- when the -- after you arrived at the house of Nzirorera's mother on the morning of the 7th of April, what were you told, and by whom, about what you were to do? 
A.	I mentioned the names of the people who I saw at the house, Kajelijeli, Baheza, Nyabusore, Michel Niyigaba, but Dusabimana was not there.  The Inkotanyi had killed Habyarimana and it was said that the Tutsis killed Habyarimana, and so consequently we spoke with Nzirorera on the phone.  He was in Kigali and gave instructions, according to which all Tutsis had to be killed; none were to be spared.  We left right away and we followed those orders.  I told you that work was done on Rukara and then we went around to the places that I indicated. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
	No, pardon me.  "Rukara," says the witness, "was the first person to be killed, and then we continued along our way to do the things that I've already talked about." 

And the interpreter in Kinyarwanda is making that correction. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
To be killed, Rukara to be killed?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Yes," says the interpreter, "to be killed, as regards Rukara."
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Did you yourself speak with Mr. Nzirorera on the telephone? 
A.	No. 
Q.	And were you present when someone was speaking on the telephone on that morning at Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house? 
A.	No.  Upon our arrival, those people were outside of the house.  They gave us those orders and that was all.  Another person, Michel Niyigaba, spoke to Nzirorera on the phone, but I never saw a conversation go on with Nzirorera.
Q.	Is it true that in 1994, in Rwanda, cellular phones were not in use? 
A.	Yes, there were some.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(No interpretation)
MR. WEBSTER:
(Microphones overlapped) ... form of the question, Your Honour.  I think it would be appropriate to ask the witness did he know of the existence of cellular phones, but to say, "Is it true that you know that there were no cellular phones in Rwanda in 1994?"  First of all, it's convoluted, and it's -- it's simply inappropriate.  This witness cannot state definitively that there were no cellular phones in Rwanda in 1994.  But you can ask the witness if he was aware -- did Nzirorera have a cellular phone, is he aware -- did such and such a person have a cellular phone, but to state there were -- this witness cannot respond to that question so I'm objecting. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We can move on to the next question. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Did anyone in Mukingo, to your knowledge, have a cellular phone in 1994? 
A.	No.  But there were land lines, but cellular phones didn't exist, or at least I didn't see any, but I could see in Gisenyi and Kigali and other places people with cell phones, but they weren't as small as they are today, but there were some.
Q.	And do you know whether or not Mr. Nzirorera had a cell phone in 1994? 
A.	I have no idea.  I know that in his house, in his office, he had a land line.
Q.	And so is it your understanding that someone at the house of Nzirorera's mother was saying that they had spoken with Mr. Nzirorera on the land line that was within the house of Mr. Nzirorera's mother? 
A.	That's what they said.  They said that they had a conversation over the phone.  All I can tell you is that there was a phone.  There was a phone at Nzirorera's mother's house.  When they told me that they had that conversation, I didn't ask where it had taken place, but I know that the phone existed.
Q.	And do you know whether or not that phone was working on the 6th or 7th of April 1994? 
A.	Yes.  It was working.  I'm sure of that.
Q.	And would you be surprised to learn that Michel -- would you be surprised if Michel Niyigaba indicated that he had no telephone conversations with Mr. Nzirorera on the morning of 7 April, nor was he aware of any conversations by others ?
A.	Listen, perhaps I shouldn't even say this, but I know under which conditions Niyigaba came to testify before the Tribunal*******************************************.  But you're here now, the Prosecutor is here, the Chamber is here.  You can summons him to appear before this Court and he can tell you what he's saying these days.  I'm testifying before the Rwandan courts these days.  Call him, summon him, to appear before this Court so he can tell you. 
Q.	Yes, Witness GFA, we are going to do that, but I'm just trying to give you the opportunity to comment on what we expect that he's going to testify to.  So I appreciate what you're saying and I hope you understand the reason for asking these questions to you at this time. 

Can you tell us if there came a time when the telephone lines were no longer working in Mukingo?
A.	Yes.  At one point in time, the phones no longer worked.  We also had a phone at home.  And at one point, all of the lines were cut off.
Q.	And can you remember, in relation to the 7th of April, approximately when that happened? 
A.	I don't remember, but I know that on Sunday, I spoke with someone on the phone.  I was at home, and that person was in Kigali.  I also talked to someone in Cyangugu over the phone.  That was on the Sunday as well.  It was on Sunday, on the 7th of April.
Q.	And do you know --
A.	And I know that I used the phone that day.
Q.	Do you know if the phone lines were still working when the Interahamwe went to the Court of Appeal in Ruhengeri?
A.	I don't remember.  I told you I don't recall.  I don't remember if the day they went to the Court of Appeals the phones were working, but I do know that personally I called Kigali and Cyangugu on the 7th.  I do acknowledge that at one point in time, all of the phone lines were cut off. 
Q.	And at what time on the 7th or what part of the day on the 7th did you use your telephone? 
A.	It was at around 9 p.m.
Q.	And was that the last time you used your phone, that you can recall, during April? 
A.	Yes.  That was the last call that I made.  I spoke to a young girl, and we didn't see each other again.  I've only seen her again in 2004, this year.
Q.	Where did you go from the residence of Mr. Nzirorera's mother?
A.	We came back to Byangabo with Dusabe, Michel Niyigaba and others.  Rukara was brought to the place and killed.  And thereafter, we went to launch attacks elsewhere.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, perhaps this is a convenient time to take the break, if you're going to move on to a new line of questioning. 

We will adjourn for 15 minutes. 
	(Court adjourned from 1109H to 1131H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The session is resumed. 

Mr. Robinson, your witness. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, back to the telephone for one second.  I'm told that the 7th of April 1994 was a Thursday.  If that is true, can you tell us whether your last use of the telephone was on the 7th of April or was on the Sunday of that week? 
A.	Yes.  I spoke for the last time to my correspondent on the 7th.  I do believe I was mistaken.  So it was a Thursday, not a Sunday, as I had said mistakenly earlier.
Q.	Thank you very much.  Murakoze cyane. 

Now, can you tell us why, on the morning of the 7th, you went to the residence of Nzirorera's mother when she had -- when she and his family had been targeting you as --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I think the witness has already stated in his -- I'm objecting to the form of the question.  The witness has already stated that he lied, that he was not telling the truth, when he made that statement to the Rwandan prosecutor.  So to put that -- the question to the witness in that form is improper.  Furthermore, the question should be broken down into two halves, if Mr. Robinson wants to pursue this:  the witness going to the house; and then afterwards, whatever reasons there would be for going to the house.  So the question is complex, it should be broken down into two parts.  And furthermore, the question is improper, given the responses of the witness during the earlier portion of his 
cross-examination. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  Can you split your question, please? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, were you lying when you told the Ruhengeri prosecutor that Mr. Nzirorera's mother and his family were targeting you?
A.	I believe I've already answered this question.  All I can say now is that I never said that they were looking for me.  I said that I mentioned my mother's ethnicity.  I have explained why we were threatened and who my mother was.
Q.	And on the morning of the 7th of April, you knew that your mother was a Tutsi and you were the child of a father of Hutu and mother of Tutsi, correct? 
A.	All I know is that my mother had changed her identity card.  Some persons were aware that my mother was Tutsi but others did not.
Q.	And you knew -- you've told us that Mr. Nzirorera and his associates were in favour of killing people who had a Hutu father and a Tutsi mother, correct? 
A.	Yes.  I've already answered this question too.  I have already answered it when questioned by another lawyer.  I explained that they had envisaged all these possibilities, and that is why my family survived, because I used certain tricks.  I think I answered this yesterday, and I'm sure that this is on the record. 
Q.	But since you were among the class of people who were targeted by Mr. Nzirorera and his associates, can you tell us why, on the morning of the 7th of April you went to the residence of his mother? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness has already answered this question too, Counsel. 
MR. ROBINSON:
	I beg your pardon, Madam President.  If he did answer this question, I didn't understand it.  I don't think I really know the answer to this question:  Why did he go to the house of Nzirorera's mother when he was among the class of people who were targeted?  If that question has been answered, I apologise, and I missed it, but I don't know it. 
THE WITNESS:
I think I've never said that I was being sought.  Did I say that?  Did I myself say that?  No.  I don't believe so.  I believe I explained this issue.  I stated that on the 7th of April, I was at Byangabo and one Niyigaba, Michel came to see me and he asked me to accompany him to Nzirorera's mother's house. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	When you left Nzirorera's mother's house, did you go directly to the Byangabo commercial centre? 
A.	I've already answered this question too.  I answered by saying that I immediately went back to Byangabo centre.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  The witness has already answered this question, on several occasions.  He has answered this question and even this morning he has done so. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Did you have a weapon with you when you went to Byangabo centre?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
He has already answered this question too, Counsel.  Please move on to another question.  You cannot repeat the same questions ad infinitum.  We are not here to waste time. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, with all due respect, I don't think I asked this question.  I asked him, in the morning, when he first left his house, did he have a weapon with him.  Now we are to the point where he's going to the place where killings occurred, after having left Nzirorera's mother's house.  I'm asking him if he now has a weapon with him when he's going to the place where the killings begin.  That's two different things.  So I would ask that the witness be allowed to answer that question. 
THE WITNESS:
You had asked me where I went after leaving Nzirorera's mother's house.  I told you that when I left that lady's house, I went to the place where Rukara was killed.  Subsequently, when we were asked to go elsewhere, I went home, I took my gun, my companions went and collected their weapons, and we left.  And I explained how Dusabe had a pistol and that his mother had confiscated it from him.  I've already said this before this Tribunal. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Who killed Rukara? 
A.	It was Michel, Musafiri, and many others.
Q.	Did you participate at all in the killing of Rukara? 
A.	No.
Q.	After Rukara was killed, where did you go? 
A.	*******************************************.  We then continued.  Another group went to Rudatinya's house.  After Rudatinya, we went up to Busogo, to Mabanga, and that is where we went on that day.
Q.	After Rukara was killed, did you go to the place where Rukara's brother Lucien was located? 
A.	Yes.  I've already said that we went there.  We went to Lucien's house also.  It's quite close by the main road.
Q.	And who killed Lucien? 
A.	(No interpretation)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Counsel, there seems to be a problem with the interpretation.  The channels weren't released in time.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The interpreters have a problem? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, Madam President.  Yes.  We do apologise.  We had a small technical problem. 

Can the witness be requested to start his answer over again, please? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, can you please start your answer over again, please? 
THE WITNESS:
He was killed by François Dusabimana, who pierced him with a spear.  Another one was known as Dusabimana, Lazar, who took that spear and spiked him with it.  Many others, including one corporal, finished him off with clubs.  Otherwise, it's these two men who struck him with a spear.  And after that, we went further up. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Did you yourself participate in the attack on Lucien? 
A.	Yes, yes.  It was right by the road.  It is quite normal that a group of a hundred people did not kill Lucien.  You know when there is an event happening close to the market, there are buildings which are close to one another. 
	(Pages 17 to 33 by Mark Porter)













	1145H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Were you among the people who struck Lucien?
A.	No.  Did I mention my name?  I mentioned the names of those who struck him.
Q.	Now, from the residence of the area where Lucien was killed, where did you go next?
A.	We went to a place which was densely populated by the Tutsis.  We referred to that location as Rudatinya -- but several families lived in that area.
Q.	Was that within the cellule of Rwankeri?
A.	Yes.  It's between Busogo cellule and Rwankeri cellule.  There's only the main road which divides the two cellules.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I've placed underneath the projector a sketch from Exhibit 95, and I would ask the video technicians to display that so that the witness can identify the location we're speaking of. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  I think the document is in place.  Is that so? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness GFA, I'm directing your attention to a sketch that's contained in an exhibit book, and I want to orient you to this sketch.  The darkest line going from the left-hand side of the sketch at the top to the centre of the sketch at the bottom represents the tarmac road.  And the direction of Ruhengeri is to the right and Gisenyi is to the left.  The figure No. 10 which is written sideways next to the rectangle represents the house of Mr. Nzirorera's mother.  The rectangular area on the tarmac road on both sides represents Byangabo centre.  And so can you tell us from looking at this sketch whether or not -- well, can you tell us the direction in which you went from Byangabo centre to the place where you participated in the killings in Rudatinya's area?
A.	You can see where we have the figure 11.  That's Byangabo centre.  Now, Rukara  died just below the tarmacked road.  We have taken from the place marked 20.  They crossed the road and they killed him below the road.  They dragged him on the road and they put him in a ditch.  We went down to about 50 metres, where we found Lucien on the little road that goes up.  Before you get to the crossroads near the place marked 20, that's where the area where Rudatinya lived could be found.  

I don't know whether you can see where you have placed a circle.  There was another family living there, referred to as Muhinda.  All the families lived close by the road.  So we went up from where it's marked 21, and when we reached the intersection on the road towards Busogo, where you see the figure E, that is where the secteur office is, the bureau de secteur of Busogo at Mabango.  And so we continued and reached the Busogo parish, where there was a convent.  And the following day we took that road.  We took the road to the left near the forest, where we had parked our vehicles, and we went to Musumba, where we killed other people too. 
Q.	Okay.
MR. WEBSTER:
I am simply requesting a clarification on the record.  I don't want to interfere with the witness's testimony, but I noticed that when he was referring to certain areas through his descriptions, it was clear, but the minute that he began to mention numbers, it became unclear to me, and I think that's because the exhibit is turned on its side and certain configurations are described as letters when they were numbers and certain numbers were inaccurately mentioned because they don't correspond to what he was actually saying.  

So I'm requesting that perhaps we should turn the exhibit in another direction, which would be the way it was written, so that when we look at these symbols on it, it's less likely that there will be any mistake.  I'm concerned about the record.  I think in terms of the witness's description during his testimony, it's clear, but if we were to go back to this record at another time and simply read what the witness is saying, then things would be unclear because what he's indicating through his description is not corresponding to the numbers as they are written on this page. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. Witness, what are you saying? 
THE WITNESS:
In order to explain my idea better, I need to be given the map so that I can take a biro or marker so that I can mark the various places I referred to. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you please hand the map to the witness, please? 

The witness is asking for a pen, also.
MR. WEBSTER:
(Overlapping microphones)... before the witness writes on that, because that is an exhibit from another witness, I believe.  I have a copy -- another copy of this drawing, and I have no problem providing it to the registry and then the witness can actually write on a drawing and then we can identify it as this witness's own map.  If you just give me one moment, please. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  It's better that he does not put any markings on the exhibit. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Show it to Mr. Robinson first before you give it to the witness.
MR. ROBINSON:
That's okay.  I trust that it's the map, so we can just proceed. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could we take this opportunity to request that the witness be given a coloured pen rather than a black one? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Somebody requested a coloured pen for the witness.  I'm not sure whose statement that was.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It's coming from the booth, Your Honours. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Because I have a red pen, but I didn't know if that was the witness saying it.  It came through my earphones.  I know I didn't say it.  I was trying to figure out where it came from, that there was a request for a coloured pen.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I believe the witness has everything he needs right now.  Very well. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, while the witness is making his sketch, I would ask that the blinds be drawn between the witness and the overhead projector, and I think it would be useful if, after the witness completes his sketch, he proceeds to the projector and explains what he has written so that we could all see it at the same time that he's speaking. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
When the witness will have been done, we shall place this sketch on the overhead projector. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, you have placed on the sketch some names and some arrows pointing to spots on the sketch.  Do those correspond with the places where the events that you've described in your testimony took place?
A.	Yes.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I don't think it's the right way up.  Can you turn it around, registrar -- registry?  I think that way is better. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, at this time I would offer this as Exhibit DNZ. 16. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objections regarding the request made by Mr. Robinson? 
MR. WEBSTER:
No.  I have no objection, but I thought that the witness was going to get up and go and explain it, and then he could position it the way that he makes sense of the indications that he's made on it.  Because, quite frankly, I can't even read it on the screen, the notations that were made.  I mean, it's Mr. Robinson's cross-examination, but that's what I recall him suggesting, that the witness could go and then actually point these things out.
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Madam President, first of all, let's just deal with whether of the exhibit can be admitted.  So, please, I would ask you to admit the exhibit.
MR. WEBSTER:
I have no objection to admitting the exhibit. 
MR. ROBINSON:
And I'm going to ask that we leave this sketch for the moment, and I'll ask the witness about his testimony, and if it's necessary to come back to it, either in my cross-examination or the redirect examination, we'll do that.  So if we could have the video go back to showing all the people in the courtroom, and I want to ask Witness GFA.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	When you got to the area that the first --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Wait a minute, please, Counsel.  Let's make our ruling.  Allow us that at least. 

So this document will bear the reference DNZ. 16 and it will be tendered as a Defence exhibit.  But maybe the witness can explain this map from where he's sitting.  Is that possible? 
MR. ROBINSON:
I'll try, Your Honour.
	(Exhibit No. DNZ. 16 admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, you have -- Witness GFA, you have the name "Rukara," and you have a line that goes to a point within Byangabo centre.  That was the place where Rukara was killed, correct?
A.	Yes, I have drawn an arrow which comes from there up to his name because I could not write his name on the very spot.
Q.	Understood. 
A.	From where the arrow comes.
Q.	That's understood.  And then you have the name "Lucie," and does that arrow point to the place where Lucien was killed?
A.	Yes, she (as interpreted) was killed in that place.  Lucien was, in fact, Rukara's elder brother.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is it Lucie or Lucien?  What is it?  What is the name?
THE WITNESS:
I do apologise, I forgot the "N" at the end of the name. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	As you continued up that small road, the next arrow you have is for Muhinda.  Were there people killed at that spot?
A.	Yes, that's where Abel Muhinda's family members were killed, to where that arrow is pointing, the location to which that arrow is pointing. I also answered that question.  Part of my group continued on the road which goes up, whereas another group went through the small path to go to Muhinda's place.  People such as Rwasubutare went to kill the family members of Muhinda.
Q.	Were you present --
A.	Another who's called Gervais Musafiri also participated in the killings at Abel Muhinda's place. 
Q.	Did you participate in the killings at Muhinda's place?
A.	No.  I left with the group who went up towards Lucien's and Rudatinya's --
Q.	Now, continuing on that small --
A.	-- towards Busugo.
Q.	Now, continuing on that small road, the next arrow that you have indicates the families Rudatinya and others.  Is that the place where those families were killed?
A.	Yes, that is the place where many people were killed, including Rudatinya 's family.
Q.	And by the time you arrived at that location, did you have a gun with you?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, did you use that gun at that location?
A.	Yes, the gun was used.  I wasn't the only one to use it.  There weren't enough guns, so even my colleagues used my gun.
Q.	And did you shoot that gun and kill people?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Who did you kill?
A.	At one place, people came into a house. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Perhaps we should not mention any names, as this will reveal the identity of the witness. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, without mentioning the names of your victims, can you tell us what you did -- what you personally did in the area of Rudatinya's family and others?
A.	I told you that we were a big group**************************************************************************** *************.  I've already said that.
Q.	And what was your role?
A.	**************************************************************.  I don't know what else you want me to tell you.
Q.	Well, did you shoot your gun at anyone and see them fall down?

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting, Your Honour.  We've gone into this.  The witness has answered the question.  We've covered this area at least two or three times in the last five minutes.  I don't see the point of going further with this line of questioning.  The witness has already mentioned and stated unequivocally that he killed people.  What else do we need on the record to establish that?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Objection sustained.  

Counsel, please move on. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	How many people did you******************************?
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm making the same objection.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, Your Honour.  I'm renewing my objection.  It has been conclusively established, this witness has admitted it, he participated in killings on the morning of the 7th.  I don't think any further inquiry is relevant.  There's no credibility issue.  The witness is stating that he killed people.  What is there to be achieved? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, may I respond? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have a problem.  The witness explained himself at great length.  He said that he participated in the killings.  He said who he was with.  Do you want him to establish the list of persons who were killed?  Is that what you're seeking to do? 
MR. ROBINSON:
No, Madam President.  I'm seeking to determine exactly the role that this witness played in these events.  This is not some killing that has nothing to do with what's on trial.  This is the very events for which Mr. Nzirorera is charged.  I want to establish the details of these events and especially what exactly this witness did.  And later, we'll look at his confession and his guilty plea, and we will compare what he did with what he confessed to, but first I want to establish exactly what he did, and I believe I have a right to do that. 
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President, may I say it's an area in which I also want to inquire about.  I don't know whether a convenient way of dealing with this is, over the weekend, that this witness in fact prepares a list, stating as fully as he can those he killed, the names of those he killed, where he knows it, their respective ages and sex, and he can provide us with that list on Tuesday of next week. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster.
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting.  I don't think it's appropriate to give the witness homework to do over the weekend, as if he was in school here.  This line of questioning is now irrelevant.  Establishing that he participated in killings, of course, is relevant to this witness's testimony, but to suggest that generating a list of everything he did, as if he's taking a guilty plea all over again, is not a relevant line of questioning.  

We've gone beyond the point at which this line of questioning is relevant, so I'm objecting to Mr. Hooper's suggestion and to any further questions along this line by Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, if I could just respond briefly. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, very briefly, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I frequently hear Mr. Webster saying that we want the whole truth to come out and that it's important for reconciliation and that all of these facts be established, but he seems to have a double standard that he only wants his truth to come out.  When it comes to the  testimony of his witnesses that's damaging, he doesn't want it to come out.  This witness needs to tell us what he did exactly, not only for your ears and the ears of all the public that's hearing it, but for his own good.  He needs to be -- he killed.  He needs to express exactly what he did and not have this glossed over like some irrelevant act.  

Now, it's very simple.  I asked him how many people he killed at this location.  That's the only question pending.  It seems it could have been answered 15 minutes ago.  So I'd ask that the witness be allowed to answer that question. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Just to -- just to respond, again, I'm sorry to keep begging the question, but clearly the Prosecutor wants all the truth to come out.  All of the killings perpetrated by this witness and by every other Interahamwe witness are being attributed to the Accused, so, certainly, eliciting this situation is only making the Prosecution case stronger.  What I'm suggesting is that it's inappropriate, or it's no longer relevant for purposes of establishing the factual record in this case.  Killings were committed.  We already have lists of victims on the trial record.  It doesn't need to go beyond that.  It starts to become irrelevant and it harasses the witness, and I'm making my objection on that basis. 
MR. HOOPER:
Can I renew my request for a list?  It will save me --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Mr. Hooper, we haven't given you the floor yet.  Please wait. 

Mr. Webster, perhaps we didn't clearly hear what you said earlier.  You said that there was already a list of the victims in the record; is that what you said? 
MR. WEBSTER:
No, Your Honour, not a list.  What I stated earlier was that the witness has mentioned the names of several families that were killed.  He mentioned the Rudatinya family, the Muhinda -- I'm sorry, it's not on the screen any more but it's a name that begins with an "M".  That family.  I think he mentioned two other families.  He said that their neighbours were killed.  So he's already mentioned a number of people that were killed on the morning of the 7th.  He mentioned Rukara, he mentioned Lucien.  So in terms of particularising the identities of all of these victims at this point, I'm suggesting the record is sufficient. 

Furthermore, it's not just a question of listing the victims, which is entirely appropriate.  I mean, we can ask him -- or the Defence can ask for the names of the victims, but going over and over again, "How many people did you kill?  What did you see?  Did you see them fall?" -- those types of questions are irrelevant for the purposes of the factual record.  It's not raising an issue of credibility.  The witness has already stated that he participated in the killings.  Asking him to go into the details of each particular murder is not adding anything to a determination of fact in this issue or to the determination of credibility of this witness or to a determination of the reliability of his evidence. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well. 

Witness, you told us about massacres in which you participated.  Are there other massacres that you've not mentioned?
THE WITNESS:
I haven't spoken about the Musumba attacks, but we went there as well.  And all of the places that I indicated to you, I was there.  Thankfully, I myself am saying that I killed people, or I acknowledge that I formed an association of criminals and I know that that is a crime.  The fact that I went to all of those places proves the fact that I formed an association of criminals and participated in those crimes.  I was there.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Mr. Robinson, can you move on to a new question? 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, at the area where the Rudatinya families and others were killed, did you give orders to other members of the Interahamwe?
A.	Before leaving, I gave you the names of people who went to kill Tutsis.  I didn't give the orders.
Q.	While you were at the area where the killing was going on, were you giving anybody any directions as to what they should do?
A.	I told you that I had my own role to play.  We were learned to kill -- we learned to kill.  I was taught to kill.  We showed others how to kill.  I even said that the sergeant was Nzirorera's younger brother; he led all of the operations.  I wasn't more powerful than he.  I acknowledge that I participated.
Q.	Witness GFA, there can be many forms of participation.  You told us that you participated in the killing of Rukara but you never struck him, and now we're talking about your participation in the events at Rudatinya's compound, so I'm going to ask you to be more specific.  Tell us exactly what you did at Rudatinya's compound. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.
MR. WEBSTER:
 (Previous translation continued)... question that I objected to at least twice already.  So I'm renewing my objection because the question is basically the same. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we point out that this is even more specific.  This question may reveal this witness's identity, and we are very concerned about this line of questioning, Counsel.  We do not want to expose the witness.  The witness will be judged in his own country, tried in his own country.  We're just trying to deal with credibility issues at this time. 

Yes, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
I stand to repeat my request of a moment ago.  Madam President, you obviously forgot about it.  We are concerned --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Yes, we did hear you, Mr. Hooper.  If we requested that the request be rephrased, that was because we rejected -- overruled on any of the objections.  We overruled it in asking for a rephrasing of that question. 

MR. HOOPER:
I have suggested that a way that, in fact, provides the Defence with essential issues that are being explored at the moment, does so conveniently, protects the witness, because it will be in writing, is that this witness provides a list, as best as he can and as honestly as he can, of those victims that he personally killed -- personally was responsible for killing -- and gives their names, if he knows them, gives their ages, and he gives and provides details of their sex.  This was regarded or described as --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we are sorry.  I don't want to cut you off but we have rendered our decision.
MR. HOOPER:
I'm renewing my application.  It was described -- you didn't come back to me as you suggested you did a moment earlier.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  I have consulted with my colleagues and we've overruled on your objection.  I had asked Mr. Robinson the question:  Where did he want to go with that line of questioning?  We are of the opinion there is no need to ask the witness to draw up a list of the victims.  The witness has explained himself at great length here, and we are satisfied with those explanations.
MR. HOOPER:
Let me just contribute to the argument because I thought you were going to come back to me, but you didn't.  It goes to credibility.  It goes to this man's capacity for evil.  It goes to just how unpleasant a man he is.  Now, we don't know the answers to that.  The Prosecution have been very coy.  They've stepped over the issue of his own actual personal actions.  He's told us, "Oh, yes, I killed and I'm very sorry for it."  Let's have some details of what this man was actually about.  It's relevant in terms of his credibility today.  It's relevant because we have a document which purports to be his full and honest response to the Rwandese prosecutor, and this isn't the prior general inconsistent statements; this, I understand, is a statement this witness maintains is true.  So let's see it in that context.  

And it was described earlier as "homework" by the Prosecution, but if this witness is perhaps willing, and given his heartfelt remorse as he's explained to us, it may not be difficult for him.  If he's willing to spend some part of the next few days in compiling such a list, we have it, we have it before us.  And we submit that there is a potential here for matters that will or might assist the Defence, both in respect of what this witness has said on a previous occasion, which he maintains to be true and which may controvert that; and secondly, in terms of how he should be viewed as a witness, it goes beyond -- we all know that on the evidence, one and a half thousand Tutsis were murdered on the 7th and on the 8th, on his evidence, and that he and his group were responsible for that.  But what part did he directly play, other than, as he's put it, the management of that group?  What was his personal involvement?  Did he kill babies, did he kill children, did he kill pregnant women, did he kill old people?  How evil is this man? 
MR. ROACH:
May I make a brief intervention? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Roach. 
MR. ROACH:
I'm concerned that this Tribunal does not appear to be favouring the hiding of any important information.  I am very concerned about the historical record of this trial, and I would suggest that if a question such as: "How many people did you kill?" or, "Who did you kill," those questions are so germane and relevant to the credibility of this witness, that refusing to allow the witness to answer those questions may put some shadow over our proceedings, because they're direct and they are precisely on point, and I would urge that you consider allowing the witness at least to answer those questions. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I don't think I have to re-state my position.  I've stated it at least two or three times already this morning.  It is of -- I mean, these objections that are being raised now by Mr. Roach are of concern to me.  If we're going to pursue this line of questioning, if the Court decides to change its position and force this witness -- or request this witness to answer such questions, I'm suggesting that we go into closed session.  I'm suggesting that this Court caution this witness.  

There is a Rule 90(E) which anticipates witnesses refusing to answer questions which may incriminate them.  There's the issue of the witness's outstanding case in Rwanda.  He's taken a guilty plea.  He has not been sentenced.  He's still at risk for further prosecution.  The nature of taking a plea in Rwanda is very different than in a national jurisdiction or even in this jurisdiction.  He pled to certain charges -- I don't want to go into the intricacies, but it's raising an issue that goes far beyond simply directing the witness to answer a question.  His case is still open, it is not resolved, he's taken a plea.  And if the Court wants to explore the complexities of going down this road, we'll have to do that, but then we're going to have to take other means.  We're going to have to engage other means to proceed.  

My objection is that this line of questioning is now irrelevant.  The witness has admitted killings.  It's not assisting in any further determination of a factual issue in this case or an issue of credibility to pursue this line of questioning, but if the Defence insists and if the Court concedes and goes down that road, then we're also going to have to look into perhaps providing this witness with additional counselling -- with counsel, and going into closed session.
 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, Rule 90(E) provides, "A witness may refuse to make any statement which might tend to incriminate him.  The Chamber may, however, compel the witness to answer the question.  Testimony compelled in this way shall not be used as evidence in a subsequent prosecution against the witness for any offence other than perjury." 

The Chamber is asking you:  Do you wish to respond to the questions that have been put to you by the Defence, the questions that you have just heard?
THE WITNESS:
No, I have no intention of responding to those questions.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber sustains the objection.  We don't believe that it's necessary to oblige -- to compel the witness to answer the questions that were put to him, especially the last question put to him by 
	Mr. Robinson.  

But, Mr. Robinson, you may continue your cross-examination and we will see, on a case-by-case basis, if the question can be answered by the witness.  

As regards Mr. Hooper's application regarding the list of victims, we said already that that objection -- that motion, was denied. 

So, Mr. Robinson, you have the floor.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.  

Madam President, with respect to my question of how many people did he personally kill at the property of Rudatinya and others, I'm respectfully requesting that the Court rule that this testimony, the answer to this question, would not incriminate this witness, since the witness has already admitted on direct examination the fact that he has killed and, in fact, killed at many locations.  To know the number of victims, number of people that he killed, does not further incriminate him, and I would ask that you rule, pursuant to Rule 90(E), that the witness is not privileged to refuse to answer that question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  I mean, the whole point here is that we don't know if the witness answering that question is going to incriminate him or not, because in order to make that determination, we would have to look at his plea agreement.  Beyond looking at his plea agreement, you'd have to look at the Gacaca law and we'd have to examine the procedure for taking pleas under the Gacaca legislation and compare it to the procedure for taking pleas under our own internal procedures.  My understanding -- I mean, this is the type of debate that should really go on outside of the hearing of the witness because it's a legal debate.  The issue is:  Does the plea -- taking of a plea under Gacaca comport with internationally recognised standards of due process?  My understanding is that these detainees are simply asked to write a letter, listing out everything that they do. 
MR. ROACH:
Just one moment, please.  I would like to join with the Prosecutor in having the witness not be a participant to this discussion. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, my objection --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Since the objections are coming one after another, we would need each point in time to ask him to leave the floor -- the courtroom.  

So, Mr. Witness, please, when you hear objections being raised, just kindly remove your headphones.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, if we're going to discuss Rule 90(E) and whether the responses of the witness are going to be -- are going to incriminate him or not, we're going to have to discuss the procedure under which he took his plea and the whole --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Mr. Roach, can you please switch off your microphone.
MR. WEBSTER:
-- that governs Gacaca.  My understanding is that a detainee is asked initially to write a letter listing all of his crimes, and then he's confronted after that by accusations of other witnesses, and then, when the plea is taken, he's not pleading to every single crime that he's ever committed.  

So now, to ask the witness before this Tribunal to list out every single thing that he's ever done compromises him, and there is the potential that it will incriminate him.  I have no way of knowing that.  But the witness's rights need to be protected.  

And we're going into an area that's irrelevant.  The witness has already acknowledged that he killed people, that he shot people, that he killed many people, that he killed people at different locations.  What do we need to explore beyond that for the purposes of the allegations in the indictment or an issue of credibility for the witness?  The witness has acknowledged the fact that he has killed people.  If we're going to go and ask the witness himself to itemise everything he does, then it's going to raise an issue of whether he incriminates himself. 

Now, the Court has the power to force an answer; 90(E) does that.  But if we go down that route, we're going to have to go into closed session, the witness will have to be provided with counsel, and it's a cumbersome procedure that's not going to advance the interests of justice.  So my application is going to be in that vein.  I am not trying to limit the historical record, but we have to be practical here and we have to balance the rights of the Accused against the rights of the victims and the fairness of the procedures and just -- we have to look at the whole issue of judicial economy and what is practicable to do under the circumstances.  And my suggestion -- or my submission, rather, is that this line of questioning is unproductive, it's wasteful, and it's irrelevant.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, may I be heard briefly on this? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Given that the witness is refusing to answer these questions and that these questions can indeed incriminate him, given the fact that he has acknowledged certain facts, but we cannot oblige him, compel him, to say here everything that he has done, so we are saying as a Chamber that we shall not oblige this witness to answer these questions, and we are asking you, Mr. Robinson, to move on to other questions. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, this is an extremely important event, the invocation of Rule 90(E) during the 
cross-examination -- I would liken it to the explosion of a bomb in the middle of this case -- because Mr. Webster knows that this witness has pled guilty to stealing a car from the parish; that's all.  And he led him -- and you'll see that in his confession, which is Exhibit DNZ. 13, 14 and 15.  And he led him in direct examination through testimony that he participated in killings at various locations, knowing full well that that was incriminatory to this witness.  

Now, when we're starting to ask on cross-examination questions about those same events, but to get the details, Mr. Webster is now suggesting that you invoke Rule 90(E) to protect -- to come to the aid of this witness, and through the proceedings that have occurred, we are now in a position where we cannot cross-examine the witness about crimes which he already admitted on direct examination.  That is fundamentally unfair.  It makes a mockery of the right to cross-examination and to a fair trial.  It's inimical to international justice and it's something that cannot --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Counsel.  We shall not allow you that.  It's not a parody of justice.  We are rendering justice.  It's you who are transforming it into a parody by asking questions which of are no interest at all.  This witness has already answered.  He said that he acknowledged, and he explained everything that he did.  So it's pointless once again to proceed and show disrespect to the Chamber.  We shall not allow that.  Please be more proper in your conduct. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I think that the translation into French was not exactly faithful to what I said.  I didn't say this was a parody of justice, so perhaps there's been some mistake in the translation.  And if you think I said "parody," then I'll apologise for something that I didn't intend to say.  In any event, this is a very important issue.  This -- my point to you is very simple.  Under Rule 90(E), a witness can refuse to make a statement which might tend to incriminate him --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please proceed, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President.  I want my application to be very clear, and you can rule on it as you wish.  Under Rule 90(E), a witness may refuse to make any statement which might tend to incriminate him.  Now, my point is that my question, "How many people did you kill," the answer to that question would not tend to incriminate him any more than the answers that he has already given in this case, and therefore it is inappropriate under Rule 90(E) to allow the witness to refuse to answer.  

So my application to you is that you make a ruling that this is not a statement which might tend to incriminate him further in these proceedings and that you direct the witness to answer the question under Rule 90(E). 

Alternatively, if you believe that this is a statement that might tend to incriminate the witness, I ask you to invoke the second sentence of Rule 90(E) and compel the witness to answer the question, with the full understanding that the testimony that he gives here would not be used against him in any prosecution in Rwanda.  So that is my application.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Roach. 
MR. ROACH:
Your decision on this matter would depend a great deal on your factual understanding or our factual understanding, and you need, of course, to have what we call adjudicator of facts to arrive at a decision on the applicability of Rule 90(E). 

One of the considerations is that we should have a sort of equality with the Prosecution.  And I should like to reiterate the point that was made that the Prosecution, in his examination-in-chief, raised the issue of the witness killing people.  And he got the witness to say that, "Yes, I admit that I killed people."  Now the Defence is asking:  "How many people did you kill?"

Now, it would not be equitable, in my respectful submission, to prevent such a question because the Prosecutor is going to be protected.  He would be able to make a statement and it would go unchallenged in its detailed examination.  So you should take into consideration, in arrival at your decision as to whether the witness ought to be asked that question -- be compelled to ask (sic) that question, and you would also take into consideration that you would like to see some equality of the applicability of questions as between ourselves. 

The other question is, perhaps it was not considered that this witness had made a plea of guilty in Rwanda for stealing a car.  If my friend -- or if the Court was under the impression that this witness had made a plea of guilty in Rwanda for committing a number of acts of murder, of course, your decision is going to be quite different, depending on what set of facts that you understand that you're making it under, that decision. Now -- so it is true that there is some potential risk.  I cannot see it very clearly, but my friend says there's a potential risk that this man, by incriminating himself, would be in a position of jeopardy, but the witness himself has testified that he wants to bare his soul and that he wants to tell all, and that is part of the process.  And so he has said it.  

He has said something that is contradictory, too, that is, that he does not intend to answer the question, and that, of course, reflects on his ability -- his credibility.  

However, the main point that I should conclude with is just a summary, and that is that the facts upon which you make your decision as to whether or not Rule 90(E) in its entirety should be applied in this particular case must be quite clear, and that is that the clarity is -- the point that I emphasise is that the Prosecutor raised the question of this man killing people in open session.  And having done that, he's let the cat out of the bag and he cannot now try to prevent asking some more specifics about that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.
MR. WEBSTER:
This is my final response.  I hope this is a final response.  There's no question of letting the cat out of the bag.  I mean, it's a defamation of the guilty plea that it's a document in evidence to suggest that this witness pled guilty to stealing a car; that's ridiculous.  We can all look at the document and see exactly what it says.  

This witness participated in a Gacaca proceeding.  I believe he was categorised in Category II, which is one of the categories where one is committing an act of murder or killing, or we can put that question to the witness.  I'm not quite -- I'm not positive of the answer myself, but my understanding is his guilty plea placed him in Category II of the Gacaca legislation.  
Furthermore, in the offences that are listed in this plea, it states that people were killed.  If we're going to resolve this issue on the basis of the allegations or the arguments of the Defence, we have to go into a bit more detail into the circumstances of the plea, what the plea was, and what the Rwandan legislation is.  

The Court has not invoked Rule 90(E); the witness has simply refused to respond.   The fact that he admits killings doesn't bring -- admitting killings and then going into enumerating every single victim of those killings are two different things.  His plea and the whole Gacaca proceedings establishes that he was involved in acts of violence, murder, criminal association, and so on and so forth.  And I think we make a mistake in comparing this plea agreement and the procedures in Gacaca to plea agreements in national jurisdictions or as they would be undertaken by this jurisdiction.  They're two very different things.  And for the Court to make its determination, if this is going to be -- if this determination is going to be made, all of those issues have to be thrashed out. 

Now, my fundament -- fundamentally, my objection is on the relevance of the questioning.  I have not asked the Court to invoke Rule 90(E).  I've cautioned the Court and I've asked the Court to caution the witness that he should be careful in his response, and if he wanted to refuse to answer, that was his right.  But my objection is not that the question is itself -- excuse me, let me rephrase that.  

My objection is that the questioning at this point is irrelevant.  It's not providing anything probative on the issue of fact or the credibility of the witness.  So, on that basis, I'm objecting. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, can you please tell us approximately how many people you killed? 
THE WITNESS:
About five.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, please proceed. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, of the five people that you killed at Rudatinya's compound area, how many of them were women?
A.	Two.
Q.	And how many were children?
A.	There was no child among the five.  The three others were two adult men and one young man.
Q.	Now, did you also use grenades during this attack?
A.	No.  I used my gun.  Grenades were used by others, other persons other than myself.
Q.	Did you strike anyone with a club or a panga or any other instrument, machete, while on the property in the Rudatinya's compound area?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That is far too specific. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	In addition to the five people that you killed with your gun, did you strike any other people?
A.	No. 

Madam President, may I say something? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You can answer "no" and that is all. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, did you rape anyone at that property?
A.	No.
Q.	Now, can you tell us how long you were at the property of Rudatinya and the others, and approximately what time it was when you left that property?
A.	We arrived there at about nine and we left the location at about eleven.
Q.	And from that location, can you tell us where you went?
A.	We went up and got to Mabanga.
MR. ROBINSON:
Can we see, Madam President, if the technicians can display the sketch that this witness has drawn?  Thank you very much.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	We're looking at the arrow where the word "Amabanga" is written.  Is that the place that you're now describing?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And can you tell us what happened at that location?
A.	There we killed members of Kiberwa's family and a child known as Ngabire; that was the only victim that I recall -- the only victims that I recall.
Q.	And what did you do at that location yourself, personally?
A.	I didn't do anything there; I was observing.  We were not all active at the same time.  Some people would be killing; others would be watching.
Q.	Now, this person Ngabire, first of all, is that spelled N-G-A-B-I-R-E?
A.	Yes.
Q.	This is the person who you told us that Mr. Nzirorera had instructed be killed, correct?
A.	Yes, I stated that Nzirorera had given those instructions to Niyigaba, that this girl which he had had with a woman known as Kiberwa, that that girl needed to be killed.  That girl had two children.  One was Nyirabid -- that woman had two children, Ngabire and another --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter has missed a name.  And it's Ngabire that was killed.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	I think there may have been a little bit of problem with that translation.  Let me go over this again with you.  Ngabire is a male, correct?
A.	Yes, Ngabire was a boy, Nyirabidabari was a girl, and their mother was known as Kiberwa.
Q.	And can you tell the name of the girl for us?
A.	N-Y-I-R-A-B-I-D-A-B-A-R-I.
Q.	And the woman, the mother of Nyirabidabari and Ngabire, her name was Kiberwa, correct?
A.	It's rather Kiberwa, spelt K-I-B-E-R-W-A, Kiberwa.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This name had already been spelt earlier because he had mentioned it earlier. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Sorry, Madam President.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And the information you received from Michel Niyigaba with respect to this boy Ngabire, can you tell us what was that information?
A.	Michel said the following: "Nzirorera spoke to me on the telephone.  He asked me to ensure that these persons are not spared, that even his son should be killed."
Q.	And the son was Ngabire, according to what you were told by Michel Niyagaba, correct?
A.	Yes.  Amongst the two children only Ngabire was known.  As for the daughter, I didn't know that she was there.  I had believed that she had fled.  But when mention was made of this matter, everyone knew that Ngabire was there.  

Personally, I didn't know which of the two children was born of Nzirorera.  All I know, that there were rumours that Nzirorera had had a child with this woman. 
Q.	But the information that you were given by Michel was that Nzirorera had requested that his son Ngabire be killed, correct?
A.	That's right, that's what he told me.
Q.	And Witness GFA, would it surprise you ****************************************************************** ******************************************?
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting at this point.  There is nobody in the public gallery.  I see he no problem in going into closed session.  This is the second time that Mr. Robinson has elicited the identity of a witness in this proceeding.  Unless you're suggesting now that -- if we could go into closed session for my submission, I would appreciate it.  I'm making that request now because I'm going to be discussing -- revealing the identity of a witness, in my submission. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We want to put a question to Mr. Robinson.  You stated **************************was one of your witnesses.  Is that what you said?  Is she a protected witness? 
MR. ROBINSON:
No, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, so why are you asking for a closed session?  We didn't understand you.
MR. WEBSTER:
Her name is on the witness list that I submitted to the Court last week.  Her witness statement has been disclosed to the Defence, and I could be a bit more clear -- clearer in my submission if we went into closed session, but it defeats the purpose of me going into it in open session if I have to make explicit the details of my application. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objections for the Prosecutor to give us his reasonings to support his motion for closed session? 
MR. ROBINSON:
No, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We shall now move into a closed session.  We apologise to the public.
