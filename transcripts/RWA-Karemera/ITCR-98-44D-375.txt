MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session, today, Thursday the 25th of November 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  The appearances are the same.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, before we get started with the witness -- 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning. 
MR. WEBSTER:
-- I assume Mr. Weyl is going to address the witness, so I would like to say something before we get started. 

Good morning to everyone.  As I stated yesterday, the Prosecution is committed to finishing all the witnesses today.  So whatever accommodations we have to make to accomplish that, we are willing to make.  

And as I also indicated yesterday, there are a few matters that I would like to address with the Chamber, since this is the last day of the session.  So even if we go beyond 3.30, Mr. Ngirumpatse can be excused if he -- if he's tired.  But there are issues that I would like to address with the parties and the Chamber on the record in the form of a -- it doesn't have to be officially characterised as a status conference, but just to tie up some loose ends. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your testimony will continue today.  You remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your evidence began.  And Mr. Weyl will continue his examination.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Good morning, Mr. President; good morning, Your Honours.  Good morning to everyone here.  Good morning to everybody in the courtroom.
THÉOBALD GAKWAYA,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued) 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Gakwaya.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	Let me remind you our rule of procedures, so to speak, in terms of delivery.  Speak slowly, observe a pause between question and answer, and spell proper names when we come across them for the very first time.  

Yesterday when we adjourned, Mr. Gakwaya, we were talking about a communiqué by Mr. Gasana in January 1994 which raised some points regarding which I'll ask you some questions.  

The communiqué, amongst other things, talked about the atmosphere of insecurity prevailing in Rwanda at that period.  I would like to have your opinion regarding that atmosphere of insecurity, and in particular about political attacks targeting political personalities in Rwanda.  Can you give us your evidence and comments regarding those attacks, and what were -- what was your understanding of those attacks?  
A.	I thank you, Counsel.  Since 1990, when Rwanda went to war, there were many violent acts, murders, of all citizens, whether they were politicians or not.  But with the -- the advent of the multiparty political system, there was -- specifically political personalities were assassinated.  Félicien Gatabazi was assassinated, he was in PSD.  Gapyisi of MDR was also murdered.  There were assassinations for which there were no obvious explanations.  

But, in an atmosphere of propaganda, where each political party was trying to take advantage of specific events, it turned out that all those assassinations were referred to in communiqués, as well as talked about in rumours circulating, leading -- pointing fingers to MRND and alleging that the president of the MRND, the chairman of the MRND was the one who ordered those assassinations.  
I remember specifically the case of Félicien Gatabazi, there was almost a unanimous feeling that MRND was behind it.  But with the passage of time, and with all the evidence which were verifiable and correct turning up, those assassinations were proved to have been ordered by the RPF.  

But, at that time, as I said yesterday, those communiqués had been drafted by Gasana, who was a very influential member of MDR's political bureau, who was also a member of the RPF's rebellion.  So, under those circumstances, and with the more serene and verifiable analysis, one clearly noticed that it was Gasana who had the talent of -- the benefit of being a PhD in -- in arts, literature.  So he was circulating documents with the intention of manipulating other people.  And it was not easy at that time to decipher the fact that there were pitfalls of manipulation in those communiqués.  

So in -- when you talk about assassinations and terrorist acts, yes, there were terrorist acts and assassinations.  But to assert gratuitously that those orders were ordered by President Habyarimana and the MRND would be a falling in collective error, which I referred to yesterday, instead of focusing on the global policy, political situation in the country.  

The government worked for -- with the parties, but the parties were manipulated by other -- by the parties themselves.  So there was nothing, really, which facilitated national cohesion.  You had the impression that you had a government of different parties where each minister in government worked for his party, instead of working for the government.  
Q.	Mr. Gakwaya, to your knowledge, do you have anything to say about Rwambuka's assassination?  
A.	Rwambuka was a bourgmestre of Kanzenze commune in rural Kigali, I believe.  He was a very influential member of MRND.  And in his commune -- the RPF had drafted most of its soldiers from his commune.  We noticed that the youths of Kanzenze commune were no longer in the commune.  People were saying that they had been recruited by the RPF rebellion.  

I had a verifiable case.  There is the case of Musonera, who used to work for the ministry of justice.  He was a friend of mine.  He asked me to assist him to convince the director general to give him a salary advance, which was applicable to all civil servants.  And we did that together and he received advanced payment.  And one Saturday when we were doing community work, he said that, "Let's meet after work for relaxation", because he had received his advance payment.  And we did that.  On Monday when I went to work -- he was at that time the secretary of -- the general secretary of the department of justice.  He was not at work on Monday.  The following day he was not there.  

The director general, who knew that we were friends, asked me whether I knew where he was.  I said no, I did not know where Musonera was.  He never returned to work.  He was from Kanzenze commune.  It was only later, after the seizure of power by the RPF, that he told me that the -- the evening of that Saturday, when we were enjoying his advance, he left and passed through Burundi in order to join the RPF.  And that proved to me that indeed there was large-scale recruitment by the RPF in Kanzenze commune, whose bourgmestre was Rwambuka.  

I don't remember the exact date of Rwambuka's assassination, so I apologise for that.  I apologise to the Chamber, Prosecutor, and the public, because my memory is not very good when it comes to dates, and even names.  But my memory is very good when it comes to events.  I remember very well that Rwambuka's assassination was an event which was much talked about in the country.  

That assassination was followed by other activities carried out against the population.  At that time some people were saying that the MRND wanted to revenge because Rwambuka, an important MRND member, had been assassinated.  I did not investigate or try to find out more about the fact that -- whether those assassinations were ordered by the MRND.  

But after the seizure of power when I spoke to Musonera, who had returned and who became the bourgmestre of Kanzenze -- at that time I was working for the collective of human rights associations.  So I was to go to a prison in Kanzenze to check on the children who were in that prison.  Even before the RPF had seized power they were there in re-education camps.  

So I spoke -- I spoke on a person-to-person basis with Mr. Musonera, and he told me how he had left the country, that he did not work in the military but worked for Radio Muhabura during the rebellion.  I asked him, in an indirect way, "Rwambuka, who was preventing RPF from recruiting people, do you know anything about his death?"  And he told me, "Look, he had to be eliminated because he was the one preventing us from recruiting children to join the RPF rebellion."  So I thought that maybe it was the RPF that had carried out his assassination.  

But, as usual, when RPF commits an act, they always cover it up.  I think that the subsequent assassinations following Rwambuka's assassination could have been a cover-up to hide the fact that RPF had been involved in previous assassinations.  Thank you.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Gakwaya.  In his communiqué, which we talked about yesterday, Mr. Gasana talked about the difficulties facing the implementation of the Arusha Accords.  To your knowledge, did President Habyarimana and did MRND really want this establishment of transitional institutions, or were they actually setting up obstacles to the implementations of the accords?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  The setting up of transitional government institutions would have certainly benefited MRND, because after MRND's experience in the Nsengiyaremye's government, I believe that MRND had faced a lot of difficulties during that phase.  So, by that stage, they were used to hearing talks about multiparty politics.  
As I said yesterday, and as you know, in the one-party system decisions are made at the top and go -- they go downwards to the people.  So MRND activated its rank-and-file recruitment so that the people would vote for MRND.  So MRND was trying to convince the people that President Habyarimana would not be the decision-maker; rather, the people at the grass roots would be the decision-makers and that will give -- empower the people.  

I think that MRND was the best beneficiary of the establishment of the transitional government.  When the president -- when President Habyarimana was sworn in, we thought that things would be very good.  But the difficulties did not come from MRND.  The problems came from other parties which did not agree on their candidate.  So the problems of the establishment of the transitional government did not emanate from MRND.  The problems emanated from the opposition parties who, at that time, were focused on the seizure of power rather than being focused on national interest.  

When the PL party split and the CDR party started demanding their place in the transitional government, whereas they had not signed the Arusha Accords -- as far as I was concerned and for other opposition parties, we did not agree to CDR's participation in the transitional government because they had refused to be a part of the Arusha Accords.  They had been requested to join -- to sign the Arusha Accords, but they refused to sign the accords.  

Within the parties, as I said, there were events which came one after another.  You had information coming from all sides.  You didn't have one specific party which could filter all the messages, all the information.  So within parties you had divisions, you had divisions at the presidential level of the parties, and in bureau -- political bureaus of the parties there were divisions that prevented them from harvesting the fruits of the existence of the political party.  And strings were being drawn from some sources.  

So, you see, you -- you ask parties to submit names of their candidates.  They give you these names today; tomorrow they come up with different names.  So there was a lot of manipulation and indecision.  And the president of our party -- the presidents of the party were deemed sometimes to push people who were not representatives of the party to certain positions.  So people started becoming concerned by those events.  
Q.	Mr. Gakwaya, maybe more concisely, what about the RPF?  Did it support the implementation of the Arusha Accords?  Try to be more concise in your answers.  
A.	RPF was not really interested in seeing the establishment of the transitional government.  It was not in its interest.  And from what most of its leaders said after they had seized power, they said that if the Arusha Accords had been implemented, then that would have been RPF's political failure.  

I believe that the RPF had its reasons for saying that.  Because the establishment of the transitional government, that is, if the government had been set up, and if it had worked in a really unified manner and focused on the general interests of the country, then some events would not have occurred.  But those events occurred and the beneficiary of those events were the -- was the RPF.  
Q.	Mr. Gakwaya, how did you -- under what circumstances did you hear about the attack on President Habyarimana's aeroplane?  
A.	The attack against Habyarimana's aeroplane took place on -- in the night of the 6th of April 1994.  I was in Bugarama, at home with my children.  We were listening to news on international TV stations because we had a satellite dish which allowed us to watch TV4 and TV5 French stations, as well as other news channels, and hear what was happening at the military level, what was happening at the level of political discussions.  So we -- we could learn those things by watching TV.  But not everything.  

At around 9 o'clock in the evening it was announced that when President Habyarimana was returning from Arusha his aeroplane was shot down and it crashed on the premises of his residence.  And on national radio stations it was -- it was announced that Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi, as well as Habyarimana's entire entourage, had died.  

Amongst the dignitaries who died there was the chief of staff of the army, who was very close to the managing director of CIMERWA.  When I heard that he had died I called the director general to extend my condolences with regard to the tragedy which had befallen on his family.  

On the following morning I went to work as usual, but very few people came to work.  And those people who were there at work were very sad.  So you could see that there was an atmosphere of despair, as well as anger.  I tried to contact all our teams at the office.  It was the same thing.  So I returned to my office and tried to see what I could do.  

When I was going to my office, on my way to my office I met an employee who was very respectful towards me, but this time he told me, "You killed the president, and you are pretending to be sad.  You are pretending to be sad whereas you are the ones who killed the president."  I did not understand what he actually wanted to say.  I saw him -- I saw that he was very angry, and in view of the way he was dealing with me I told myself, something is amiss here.  

I didn't have the courage to remain at the office.  So I returned home in order to listen to the news on the events which were talked about throughout the world.  Sometime later my wife told me that when she had gone to work things were not good because her colleagues and friends did not speak to her, and that she noticed that people didn't want anything to do with us.  

So, after that assassination, on a personal basis, this was my experience.  But on a general level there were demonstrations of discontent and anger here and there.  Everybody agreed that RPF had killed the president, and the general feeling was that the opposition parties were RPF's allies.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, following the assassination of President Habyarimana, you know that violence broke out in Rwanda.  Can you tell us, how did the acts of violence start, and who were the instigators of the violence, to your knowledge?  
A.	It would be difficult for me to answer your question regarding the violence at the national level.  But, in the area where I was, and since we could not move about easily because of the violence, I saw that there was a formation of groups of criminals -- I don't know how to describe them.  But -- but those groups were led by their gang leaders.  And each group worked independently from one another.  The most -- the biggest group could impose itself on other groups.  

So I can say the situation was one of chaos.  You had the law of the jungle.  Their motivations were different.  Some groups said that they're to kill Tutsis, where the others said that they're to kill members of opposition political parties.  Some members of those groups took advantage of that to settle scores against their neighbours in respect of personal sentiments, properties, love matters, and so on and so forth.  So all these motivations were there.  

And anyone who felt that he was strong and able took advantage of the situation and formed a group.  And those groups, for the most part, consisted of young people.  But, at times, you could see mature adult men.  There was a time I even saw an elderly man who could not even walk easily, yet he accompanied the group.  

So, personally I noticed that there were groups which, for the most part, were armed with traditional weapons, and each group decided what action it would take, either to steal, kill, or loot anything.  So sometimes those groups would fight amongst themselves.  I heard that when my car at CIMERWA had been stolen by one of those groups, when that group got only a few kilometres away they were chased and my car taken by the bigger group. 

So the groups -- those groups benefited from the chaos due to various reasons.  So I cannot -- I don't know how to describe them.  But, to my knowledge, there was no direct link between the groups.  They were not -- no command, even.  The strongest groups prevailed.  In certain areas, some groups had protected Tutsis.  They did not want their neighbours to be touched.  But the bigger groups coming from other areas would come there and drive away groups who had protected the Tutsis and kill the -- they would kill the Tutsis.  

So it was a chaotic situation.  You did not know who was doing what.  What you saw was violence and desolation.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Gakwaya.  According to the indictment, and the general acceptance today, the crimes that were committed at that time are ascribed to a group that is referred to as the Interahamwe.  In your view, what is the meaning of "Interahamwe", post-6 April 1994?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  It's unfortunate that the Rwandan tragedy can only be read in the media.  I told you that even I was following what was happening in the international media and what the French journalist said, that the militia of the MRND, the Interahamwe, is bringing about chaos among the population.  I don't know who that journalist was working for but, in my opinion, and from what I have told you, I realise that those who -- were spreading desolation.  

I had an opportunity to meet a group who took some money from me and allowed me to go through.  I was surprised to see that the most important three leaders in that group, one of them -- well, I think he was a representative of the Inkuba.  The Inkuba was the youth wing of the MDR.  The other one was not even a leader of the MRND in the secteur.  But he's known to be a member of the MRND youth wing, but not at the leadership level.  I realised that there were farmers, stout young men, strong young men that I did not know previously.  So this was a gang of people made up of those who called themselves the MRND, those who called themselves the MDR, and those I was seeing for the first time such as the stout, strong men ready to do anything.  

I don't know what happened in the various other localities of the country, but where I lived I saw that it was not the Interahamwe that I knew that was carrying out these acts.  These were disorganised groups, each one working for his own interests, for different objectives.  Thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Gakwaya, according to the indictment, Mathieu Ngirumpatse allegedly had authority over these groups, which are referred to as the Interahamwe.  What do you make of that?  
A.	In my own locality where I live, and even at the national level, I don't even know if those young people knew Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Because these -- in the beginning these were groups and -- an initiative of young persons who followed the political trends of their parents and accompanied their parents to political rallies.  

And I told you that on several occasions I was invited, as a leader of an opposition party, to MRND meetings.  In the beginning there were -- there was no violence.  You were met by young people who were chanting the ideals of the MRND.  But in the sings -- in the songs, of course, they were talking about the virtues of their political parties.  
So, in the beginning, there was no violence involved in the activities of these young people who supported the parties.  Now, with time, when the statements of the political leaders became more provocative, the young persons, when they were discussing provocative statements made by this leader or that leader, they started quarrelling among themselves.  
But it was not a hierarchical institution from the top to the bottom.  These were local groups, so that when the party decides to hold a rally in this locality or that locality, it was the local organising committee that took over and organised it.  So they were not -- people did not come from the national level to give instructions to the local groups.  Each group worked the way it saw fit to enable its party to operate smoothly.  

Now, your question was this, whether Mathieu was the leader, or whether he had a certain authority over the Interahamwe.  I say no.  No, because, while I was in hiding, when even I was being chased more than those who are referred today as genocide survivors, when I was in hiding, each time that they found my traces I would change my hiding place.  

And I heard that the Gishakwa (sic) tea factory was still operating, and that the director was still operating without any problem.  Since I had worked there, I was trying to change my hiding place and get close to Gishakwa.  I was going on Nyungwe towards Gishakwa.  When I got close to Ntendezi, I was told that the Ngirumpatse that they'd been referred to as being in the top leadership of the Interahamwe is not the one you are seeing here.  Because I was told that the bourgmestre of Karengera commune -- he was called Sinzabakwira, Straton.  
Q.	Mr. Gakwaya, are you able to spell the proper names.  
A.	Sinzabakwira, Straton.  The name is S-I-N-Z-A-D-A-K-W-I-R-A (sic), Sinzabakwira.  Straton is S-T-R-A-T-O-N, Straton.  At the time he was the bourgmestre of the Karengera commune; that is my native commune.  To become a bourgmestre he presented himself as an -- as a member of the MDR.  But, to my knowledge, after he became bourgmestre he changed.  He became a PSD member.  Today, even though he's a prisoner, I'm told that he has become an RPF member.  He is -- lately I heard he was in the Cyangugu prison, but I thought he was -- I heard he was transferred to another prison.  

But the issue is this:  When he came to Ntendezi -- Ntendezi is the crossroad between the road going from Kibuye.  The crossroad is close to Mwaga (sic) river.  But Ntendezi, after the junction of the road from Kibuye and Nyungwe, Ntendezi is a locality that you cannot avoid.  

And it is -- at that time it was being said that the French mission was going to intervene to protect people who were still alive.  So those who survive elsewhere -- Gikongoro, Kibuye -- all of them were moving towards Cyangugu, where it was thought that the French intervention force was going to be based.  

Among those who came, I was told that there was one called Umulisa, Umulisa.  It is spelled U-M-U-L-I-S-A.  Umulisa.  They told me that the son of the chairman of the MRND, Umulisa, Ngirumpatse Mathieu's son, was arrested at Ntendezi, together with the wife.  And the wife was taken by the bourgmestre to the communal head office in the Karengera commune, about 10 kilometres from Ntendezi.  And that Umulisa and other persons who were with him have been led to the Nyungwe area, and that it was not known if they had not been killed.  

So the fact was that the wife indeed was led to the Karengera commune, and that the following day the bourgmestre brought her back to Ntendezi.  
Q.	Mr. Gakwaya, the Chamber is going to ask us to limit your testimony because the Chamber will have to rise today.  So can you be more concise in telling us what happened to Umulisa and your own opinion of my -- in relation to the question that I put to you, i.e., Mathieu Ngirumpatse's authority over those persons who were perpetrating these crimes in Rwanda at the time.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Each time I come here I get the impression that I'm being pushed to finish quickly, and I wonder whether the idea is to know the truth or whether they just want to know what they want to know.  In any event, I will proceed.  

Umulisa, I'm told, was sticking to -- into the forest.  I don't know if he died or not.  I do not even know if Ngirumpatse's son is still alive.  What I do know is that it did happen, even though they knew that he was Ngirumpatse's son.  So if this group that is said is made up of Interahamwe, and the Interahamwe was under the orders of Mathieu, if that happened, it is because Ngirumpatse was not in charge of that militia.  And even less, if the militia was for -- under the party, they were independent.  
And, as I was told -- telling you, the bourgmestre who became bourgmestre as MDR changed party to the PSD, and he was leading this group.  So I maintain that these groups were independent and led by other interests different from what we are talking about today.  Thank you.  
Q.	I thank you, Gakwaya, for understanding what our problem is.  And I do not want you to think for a moment that I am preventing you from -- from speaking.  I just do not want us to be in -- to encounter difficulties.  You are free to say whatever you want to say, but in a very concise manner.  Thank you, Mr. Gakwaya.  

At that time, do you think that Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse could have prevented the crimes that were being committed?  
A.	It was impossible, because he was not where I was, for example.  Even after the killing of President Habyarimana, I don't know if there were party meetings where decisions could be taken.  Because after the killing of President Habyarimana there was chaos.  Everyone was trying to save his skin.  I don't know who could have had any authority over these groups that were set up in a very disorganised manner in the communes, simply because they felt they were stronger.  I don't think anyone could have stopped this trend.  

And, besides, in certain areas the communal authorities were overwhelmed, even though they had the -- they had policemen to help them.  But it was a very strong trend, stronger than everyone.  And I don't see how Ngirumpatse -- besides, not only Ngirumpatse.  No other authority could have stopped them.  Thank you.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Gakwaya.  Mr. Gakwaya, are you able to tell the Chamber if you remained in Rwanda after the victory of the RPF?  And, in that event, what were your activities in Rwanda from -- during that period?  Do that as concisely as possible.  Let me say what I said earlier, that I'm sorry if you appear to be frustrated, but be very concise.  
A.	Thank you.  I remained in the country when the RPF took over.  The party leaders were still in the country, and who could travel to Kigali were convened to a meeting, and to assist in the establishment of what they referred to as the government of national union.  

Since I was a bit far in Bugarama, as CIMERWA in the south is, it was the chairman of the party, Nayinzira, who had been evacuated by the RPF to Byumba from 1994, together with him -- and together with other political leaders that had been evacuated by the RPF and who, since the killing of President Habyarimana had remained at Byumba under the protection of the RPF.  For the PSD, I remember Rugenera, Rugenera, Marc.  If I have to spell the name that takes a little more time.  Rugenera is R-U-G-E-N-E-R-A, Rugenera.  Marc is M-A-R-C.  Rugenera, Marc.  Ntakiruntika:  N-T-A-K-I-A -- rather, R-E-N-T-E-K-A (sic).  Ntakiruntika, Charles.  Charles is C-H-A-R-L-E-S.  I cannot recall those who were evacuated for the MDR.  

But in the national office of the national parties, there were some leaders who were evacuated and who were being indoctrinated during that entire period.  When we went to the meeting for the establishment of the government of national union, I realised that we had different views of what had to be done.  

Regarding my party, I was not in favour of we signing the declaration of victory by the RPF saying that the RPF is an historic party which had to take over all the political power and direct everyone else.  Well, since they were victorious I could not fight against that.  But we agreed on the position of vice-president, which was given to Kagame, Paul.  In the Arusha Accords, I recall that there was no mention of vice-president.  And I found it strange that we had a president, a vice-president, and a prime minister.  I thought that that could lead to a situation of overlapping -- overlapping activities and authority.  

Bizimungu was to be the president, but there should not have been a president (sic).  So the president of the PDC told me that all those things were discussed and that I did not have to challenge that, because if I challenged that it would delay the establishment of the transitional government, whereas time was not on our side.  

I was hoping that they would listen to me.  But following that intervention, I saw that Mr. Mazimpaka, he was the vice-chairman of the RPF.  Mazimpaka, Patrick.  Mazimpaka.  If this name is not known, then let me spell it.  It is M-A-Z-I-M-P-A-K-A.  Mazimpaka.  Patrick is P-A-T-R-I-C-K.  He came with the documents, the declarations.  He came to see me at my house in Kigali.  

It was difficult, because Kigali had been virtually deserted.  And when you see people going to your house, it was thought that he was -- they were going to kill.  It was a very difficult situation.  I was surprised myself when I saw the soldiers who were accompanying Mazimpaka.  He brought the document and he said, "Well, here are the documents.  You have to sign them because time is not on our side.  To say that you -- the government of national union, it needs to start its work to organise things in the country."  

I realised that the situation was more difficult than I thought.  I signed it; it was not the president of the PSD.  I signed it, under duress, because I realised that up till that time -- up till now I maintain that the vice-president was not necessary.  
Q.	Mr. Gakwaya, please tell the Chamber, what was your situation?  What were your professional and political activities when the RPF took over?  Let me repeat this once again.  Say -- answer very concisely.  And, if necessary, I will ask follow-up questions.  But just tell us what your professional and political activities were from 1994.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  At a political level, I have already said that the rallies or meetings of the political parties continued with members and survivors who were still living in Rwanda.  And in that regard I was still attending political party meetings with the RPF, together with the other parties, MDR, PSD, PL, in the conditions that I have described.  

Regarding professional activities, basically I focused on starting off the cement factory in Rwanda which had been destroyed up to about 90 per cent.  I wanted to do -- I did my work, and we were able to start off our operations properly in November, whereas I started this work in July.  So four months to restart the operations of a big factory like CIMERWA following the tragedy that occurred in our country was not easy.  But I feel proud that I did that work.  And that is on the professional level.  

Culturally, I made sure I stayed far way from political positions because -- but I participated in activities, but I left others to progress politically, because I thought it was in my interests to take time to see exactly what was happening.  When I was being urged to take on political positions I was not interested at all until I was dismissed from my position as director of CIMERWA.  

So, as usual, I went to work in human rights associations, and that is how I went to the prison in Kanzenze where I met Musonera who was the then-bourgmestre.  I remained in activity -- I continued the activity of human rights association until 1980. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Another illegal situation which is not in our country, that is the guilty plea which gives the advantage of a lesser sentence.  The law that governed the trials of genocide since 1994 brought this new concept in Rwandan laws.  Personally I realised that what was expected is not what we obtained.  Because, in the reports that we wrote -- we were various teams working for LIPRODHOR.  But all the reports that were collated in the centre of information and documentation on genocide, this centre was working within the LIPRODHOR.  And this centre was putting together a book called "The verdict" which, in a general manner, carried out analysis of the genocide proceedings.  

At the time we were told that this guilty plea was a way of assisting the prosecutor to help in discovering the truth in a very -- in a speeder manner, with the collaboration of the detainees.  

But what intrigued me is that, at that time, people who had settled in Kigali had looted the properties of people who fled.  And some of them even settled in beautiful houses of people who were not there.  They settled their families and friends in those houses.  So, amongst those people, some judicial police officers were recruited from their ranks.  

So, in those reports it was said that someone would be taken.  And that person who could -- could not deny having committed acts of violence or murder which were committed in broad daylight.  So most of those people were known by the public.  So those people would be taken, and they were known, notorious criminals.  So, in Kinyarwanda we have the words "ruharwa", that is, a notorious criminal.  

So those people were taken and used not to help ascertain the truth, but rather they were taken in order to build a body of evidence against innocent people.  Let's say I occupy X's house, but I learned that X or his son is still alive.  So to avoid X coming back to claim his rightful property -- and this is general explanations.  So that X cannot come back, or his kin cannot come back and claim their rightful property which I'm illegally occupying, what will be done is that that X will be described as a perpetrator of genocide.  

So they will tell the notorious criminals, and tell them, "Look, we are going to reduce your penalty, because the law authorises me to do that."  And they would read to them the sections allowing the reduction of penalty.  So those criminals were asked to say, for example -- "Even if X was not at the crime scene, X gave -- just say that X gave you money, ordered you to kill people."  And when you told them that you'd killed certain -- some people, they were happy.  So those statements were statements of false accusations.  

So they built up a case file against Mr. X.  So when Mr. X or his next of kin returned to claim their rightful property, they would be thrown in jail.  And they would tell them, look -- they would question those people and they would tell -- so they would expropriate the properties of those people while jailing them.  They would even kill them just to see to it that the properties which had been wrongfully seized would not go back to their rightful owner.  This has continued.  

I think that the international community wanted to assist the country so that they could use the concept of guilty plea to find people guilty of commission of acts of violence and genocide.  But that guilty plea has been misused.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Gakwaya.  For how long did you work as an observer and human rights activist?  From when up to what period were you involved in the monitoring activities, human right monitorings in Rwanda?  
A.	From 1996 until 2001.  From July 1996, I believe.  I told you, look, I'm not very good at dates.  But I believe it was from July 1996 up to April 2001.  
Q.	What did you do after -- or, from April 2001? 
A.	From April 2001 I participated in the government, in the ministry of internal security. 
Q.	You became a minister?  How did you become a minister in -- a minister of internal security in Kagame's government?  
A.	I know it's not easy to perceive that innocently.  But, you see, there was a problem within the RPF itself.  A problem of succession.  Vice-President Kagame wanted to seize the reins of power.  But most RPF members, most leaders thought that Bizimungu had discharged his duties properly and should therefore continue.  So within the party there were what I'd call divisions regarding who should replace Bizimungu, or whether Bizimungu should continue being president.  

But since the -- Kagame and others held the power, they decided that Bizimungu, Prime Minister Rwigema, and ministers who had worked with Bizimungu for five years should leave the government and they should start afresh.  So they used means which were not very democratic in order to compel Bizimungu to resign.  He resigned with his government.  But without resigning -- before resigning, he could not leave without setting up a new government.  
So before his imposed resignation, Bizimungu appointed a prime minister and a government so as to avoid an institutional vacuum.  That is how come my cousin, the prime minister, and myself, and some other ministers were appointed by President Bizimungu.  We were sworn in on the same day on which he was supposed to resign.  And we worked with President Kagame.  

Now, coming to that question in a more relevant manner:  Within the RPF there was a strong desire to shut up all political parties.  So what they would do, they would infiltrate parties, they would seek out weak leaders and promise them positions of responsibility, or respectful posts.  So they would ask them to remain officially within their party, but in an unofficial member (sic) those people would be RPF members.  And there are people who played that game and went along with it.  But it -- it was rare to have people who do not agree to that game.  And if they did so, they were persecuted.  

So we noticed what had happened to MDR in the case of people like Gasana.  The same thing happened to PL.  So we tried to go ahead of the RPF.  And when we learnt that ministers who had worked with Bizimungu had to leave, including a Népomuscène, who was the leader of a certain committee.  So we -- there were rumours that we had started indoctrinating someone called Mukezamfura, Alfred.  And there was also -- there were issues pertaining to Rwigema and (sic) Célestin.  There were issues concerning alleged corruption in the building of schools.  So we realised that there were people being indoctrinated so that they would be recruited by the RPF.  

So I was asked to replace Nayinzira in government.  And this one -- I had difficulties working with the RPF.  Because I joined the government as someone who was unknown, because they had not screened me.  They had not vetted me.  I'd been nominated by -- by our party's -- PDC's executive bureau.  So -- but the RPF was not happy to see someone they had not vetted join the government.

THE WITNESS (continued):
So they decided that they could choose what I could do in government.  And since I was drawing up a damning human rights report, they decided to entrust me with the task of dealing -- the police force and the prison system so that I could not be critical.  Thank you.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Gakwaya.  Since you were the minister of prisons and internal security, what did you -- what was the state of affairs in Rwandan prisons at that time up to 2001 (sic)?  What was the state of the prisoners -- the state of the prisons and the prisoners? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  The situation was very sad.  And it is still sad even today.  There were many people who were suspects.  The country did not know where to put those suspects.  So all the country's prisons were overcrowded.  

For example, a prison meant for 2,000, 3 -- or 3,000 people, you had 15,000 people.  You had double-decker beds, you know.  

And -- the -- there is an -- a book written by an Englishman in which he described the conditions in Rwandan prisons, that was a foreigner's observation.  But I can tell you me -- as a Rwandan minister, I saw many things there.  And when I was -- I had known about it when I was writing -- human rights report.  But this time around I witnessed the situation personally and closely.  

The previous government had decided that the International Committee of the Red Cross, ICRC, which was assisting the country in a feeding programme in prisons -- the government started bragging and boasting that they would -- were achieving economic growth -- significant economic growth; therefore, they did not need the assistance of the ICRC and that the ICRC could supply provisions or foodstuffs to the prisons for only six months, after which the government would take over.  So when I joined the government, ICRC's six months had expired, so it was up to the Rwandan government to assist the prisoners. 

At that time there were 140 official prisons in Rwanda.  But don't forget there were unofficial -- unofficial prisons in Rwanda.  You have, for example, the communal jails, which sometimes have more prisoners -- more detainees than the official prisons.  

And then you had military prisons, which were not under my jurisdiction.  They were prisons which had been set up in military camps where I could not go.  There were several detention centres which I knew about but could not go there.  

So I don't know how many people were in those prisons.  But the number varied.  I will not go into details because we don't have enough time.  

But according to my experience, amongst the detainees there was a campaign which was intended to assert -- which -- which was to ask the prisoners -- to say, "Look, just agree that you have committed this crime."  

So actually the Gacaca prison system started in prisons, because you had religious preachers who went to jails and who would read out from the Bible telling the people, "Confess to your sins."  That was a wide-scale campaign in jails.  And people who had been in jail for ten years or eight years in atrocious conditions said, "Look, instead of dying here, I can just say, 'Look, I'll confess to having stolen a goat because I can pay it back.'"  

So in that campaign there were people who agreed to having committed crimes.  Of course, there were crimes who could not -- criminals who could not have denied having committed the crimes.  But the concept was to try to convince as many people as possible that the genocide had taken place, and there was a campaign to tell people that it was the government that had planned the genocide and carried out the genocide.  

So people were conditioned to say, "Look, the genocide was planned in the government and carried out by the government."  So it was like a religious doc -- doctrine.  

It's very unfortunate that such a major crime has been trivialised and placed at the level of ord -- an ordinary crime.  So they were trying to look at genocide as something which is very simple.  Whereas, this -- this is a crime against humanity, entire humanity.  

The people who have the power to investigate and de -- and make decisions regarding the crimes of genocide have to know that beyond the goodwill -- beyond their goodwill -- beyond the goodwill of the entire humanity to eradicate genocide and related crime, I have to tell you that there was manipulation when it came to writing the history of genocide in my country. 
Q.	Mr. Gakwaya, did that manipulation have any effect on testimonies and evidence given before Rwandan courts and tribunals elsewhere? 
A.	Already in 1996 the -- an observer at the Human Rights League -- LIPRODHOR wrote in a document which said that, in spite of the fact that the genocide had taken place, already we are seeing people who are using the -- misusing the genocide in order to jail people.  

That document was severely criticised, especially by Ibuka.  And they described people with that view as being negationists who did not want to acknowledge that the genocide had taken place.  But the LIPRODHOR told Ibuka, "Look, we are all working for the same goals.  We are looking at the events which had occurred." 

I remember once a senior officer in the prime minister's office was arrested when he went to his home area in Butare during the genocide commemoration.  So a group of people went up to him.  They started crying, pointing fingers at him.  And he was arrested and thrown in jail.  I don't know if he's still in jail or -- in jail or I don't know whether he's been released. 

So when we heard about that, we went to the ground.  I like using this word often.  We went to the ground in Butare to see what was happening.  And after our verification we deemed that that person had -- was not in Rwanda at all during the genocide.  

But those people who were crying had been manipulated.  I remember that guy's name was Antoine.  I don't remember his second name. 

So five people were brought before authorities and -- including an old woman and they were told, "Look.  Antoine killed your family members.  Can you identify him?"  

Antoine was very fair in complexion.  So you could not have mis -- if you knew him, you could not have mistaken him.  He was quite tough and stocky.  But those people could not identify Antoine at the identity parade.  

The -- so we saw that at a court -- and I just want to raise this example to show you that there were people who concocted evidence so that some people would be arrested.  And the people who did that wanted Antoine to lose his work as a senior officer in the prime minister's office.  That was the case when it came -- when it -- that was the -- this -- that case also applied to other positions, like in the office of the public prosecutor, court registrars, and so on and so forth. 

So the -- if someone wanted you thrown in -- in jail, they would just have said, "Look, you participated in jail (sic) or participated in crimes against humanity."

But when you are accused of genocide, it was abominable because you are not even allowed to explain yourself. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Gasana (sic).
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I still have two lines of questioning.  I think I will need about 20 minutes.  Would your -- would your Trial Chamber like me to go on and finish now, or would you -- do you -- do you think we should take a break and I conclude after the recess?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, we -- we think that you are in a good groove.  So maybe you -- you could continue and complete now, if that's okay. 
MR. WEYL: 
I'm at your disposal, Mr. President.  I think that's the best solution. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Let me recap -- or let -- let us recap, and I would like to ask you for some clarification.  

Mr. Gasana (sic), you were an observer of the situation in Rwanda, particularly between 1996 --
1996 (sic) and 2001.  I'm talking about Rwanda, because you were born in Rwanda, you lived in Rwanda.  Right now I want us to look at the period of 1996 (sic) to 2001 when you were a privileged, so to speak, observer of the events in Rwanda.  

You had -- being one of the leaders of an opposition party prior to the 6th of April 1994, had you heard Mathieu Ngirumpatse inciting people to hatred against Tutsis?  
A.	I -- I -- I didn't know how Ngirumpatse looked like initially physically.  I heard about him at the annual diplomatic meetings hosted by the president.  I heard about our embassies -- I heard about Ngirumpatse, Juvénal Renzaho, and Jubarogo (sic), who were three well-known ambassadors.  

The third -- it was said that Ujadume (sic) was Rwanda's ambassador to the Vatican.  And it was said that he was a good ambassador.  Since the war -- I don't know when did he stop being an ambassador.  But when he returned to Rwanda, he did not hold a very senior post which would have allowed us to know him. 
Q.	Mr. Gakwaya, please try to focus on what I'm asking you.  I would like to request you to answer specifically to the questions that I put to you in this line of questioning.  Otherwise, the Chamber would have to interrupt us, because I had asked for only about 20 minutes, so please answer my questions as put to you in as concise a manner as possible.  

Now, from 19 -- in the period prior to the 6th of April 1994, did you hear Mathieu Ngirumpatse incite people to hatred against Tutsis?  So that is my question.  
A.	I never heard anything like that.  We would receive reports.  We would deal with the reports seriously.  And most newspapers which were published in the country, I read them.  I listened to the radio and got information from other sources in Rwanda.  But I never heard about that. 
Q.	Did you ever hear Mathieu Ngirumpatse incite people to commit crimes against Tutsis? 
A.	No, I never heard that. 
Q.	And did you hear Mathieu Ngirumpatse incite people to eliminate the Tutsi? 
A.	Never. 
Q.	Did anyone tell you that Mathieu Ngirumpatse may have made statements intended to incite people to eliminate the Tutsi or commit crimes against them?  
A.	I want a clarification in respect of this question.  Am I to answer this question as a human rights activist?  
Q.	In any capacity.  
A.	Never. 
Q.	In the course of that period, did anyone tell you that Mathieu Ngirumpatse may have committed acts offensive -- offensive acts against the Tutsi? 
A.	Nobody told me that.  And in all the reports that I had the opportunity to see, Mathieu never appeared as anyone who may have participated in any manner whatsoever in this manner to incite against the Tutsi, not only against the Tutsi and not -- also not against non-members of the MDR (sic). 
Q.	Mr. Gakwaya, the period that preceded the 6th of April 1994, did anyone tell you that genocide was being prepared against the Tutsi in Rwanda? 
A.	No one ever told me that a genocide was being prepared in Rwanda.  But as I was telling you, I was in Cyangugu.  

At one point in time there was what was referred to as a club of party leaders.  And there were events that were occurring.  And the chairpersons of the parties used to meet in the morning, in the evening, come out with press statements.  

And what I realised is that in the political bureau of the parties and the -- among the leaders of the political parties, there was a gap in information.  The leaders of the -- the club of the political leaders came out with a report.  And we also read in the statements that there were -- military training; militia had been trained and armed; and that they had been positioned all over the place.  But that just reflects the manner in which we were working at the time.  

Let me give you a specific example.  There was a meeting in Bujumbura which brought together chair -- the chairpersons of the political parties and the RPF at Bujumbura.  On the same day -- on the same day there was a meeting in Kigali bringing together political parties and representatives of the Catholic church who was brought in to assist in arriving at a consensus that would bring peace to the country.  

And the communiqué that the parties -- party leaders in Bujumbura came out of -- came out with -- and the communiqué that came out of the meeting in Kigali were different.  There were differences -- internal differences among the political parties and -- saying, "Why did you sign this in Bujumbura?  And why did you sign this in the episcopal meeting?"

That is to say, that, in all that, it was possible for the chairman of the party to have some information which was not known to the members of the political bureau.  

The specific question that you put to me, I got to know after the communiqué that -- to the PSD -- the chairman of the PSD signed came out. 
Q.	Mr. Gakwaya, now I would like to focus on that period from the 6th April 1994 to 15th July 1994.  During that period did you hear anyone charging Mathieu Ngirumpatse for inciting hatred against the Tutsi? 
A.	Since July and August 1994, four human rights associations carried out a census in Kigali to collect new information on persons who in one way or the other may have par -- participated and incited to the hatred -- to hatred -- to kill the Tutsi.  I think about 3,000 names came out.  There's a report on that. 

Mathieu, being a public figure, if he had done that, would have appeared -- would have been on that list.  And to my knowledge, he is not on that list. 
Q.	Mr. Waka (sic), during that period 6th April 1994 to 15th July 1994, did anyone tell you that he committed criminal -- he carried out criminal activities on the instructions of Mathieu? 
A.	As I told you when the genocide started, I was far -- very far from the capital.  But since 1994 I was often in Kigali.  And apart from Mathieu I lost a lot of friends, Hutus and Tutsis, and I wanted to know exactly what was going on in Kigali.  I even tried to get information on my colleagues, such as the minister of the interior, who did not come back.  

Munyazesa, Faustin is a man that I know very well.  And I was wondering if Munyaze (sic), as minister of the interior, organised meetings or invited people to kill others.  

I did not hear anyone.  Neither Munyazesa nor Mathieu may have incited people during that period to kill. 
Q.	Mr. Gakwaya, thank you.  During the period 1996 to 2000, when you were a human rights activist, during the trials that you attended, did the name of Mathieu Ngirumpatse come up as someone who may have participated in crimes committed against all or part of the Rwandan population? 
A.	Once again, thank you.  In the monitoring that we did, we went around the entire country.  But in Kigali we had not yet started this kind of trial.  When that started, the team I was working in did not work in the capital.  And that is where we probably would have gotten something against Mathieu.  

But in the reports of those who work in Kigali, in the reports that were drawn up by the -- collated in the -- the document station centre on genocide proceedings, it was not mentioned anywhere that Mathieu may have committed any such act. 
Q.	Mr. Gakwaya, you were minister of security -- minister of the interior and in charge of prisons.  During that period did you receive any reports that prisoners in the prisons charged Mathieu of any offence? 
A.	Curiously, I was a minister seven years after power was taken.  What is surprising is that -- all the reports that came to me -- I met the population every Thurs -- every Tuesday and Thursday.  And all the reports that I received focused on barbaric acts -- acts of soldiers who were spread in the various communes as people in charge of security.  These were complaints relating to vandalisation of houses, properties, disappearance of persons.  On no occasion did I receive any complaints that mentioned Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	Mr. Gakwaya, when you were minister of security, did you have access to archives or records that talked about the organisation of genocide in Rwanda in 1994? 
A.	Thank you once again.  When I arrived in the ministry, there were no archives.  Prior to that the prisons were under the ministry of justice.  The police did not exist.  

So these are new departments in which I could not find previous records.  I referred to what was happening elsewhere where those institutions existed.  

Given -- in the prison services, since I had worked in the ministry of justice and since I had collated a report on activities of the ministry, I knew a bit about those.  But there were no records as such.  So I'm not saying -- well, if there were records, I probably would have seen them.  And that may have justified that there was organisation of a genocide.  

But given the fact that -- as a representative of political party, I was trying -- and I tried to find out whether there was an organisation from the -- based on the information available to me at that time and information that came to me subsequently, I'm saying that there was no organisation of genocide in Rwanda.  

There were acts of genocide because I see -- I saw people die because I'm a Tutsi -- because they were Tutsi.  I saw people die because they were Hutu.  But to say that there was an organisation that planned it, if such an organisation existed, then that organisation is the one that brought war to Rwanda.  And it cannot be any other organisation than the RPF.  

Because at the time of the drafting of the 2003 constitution, I requested -- or I asked why it was being said that genocide -- the genocide started on the 1st October 1994 -- or 1st October 1990 -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Corrects the witness. 
THE WITNESS:
That is what is written in the Rwandan constitution.  Whereas, the United Nations states that the Rwandan genocide -- I'm not talking about the Tutsi genocide.  I'm talking about Rwandan genocide -- started -- those acts are the ones that started 1st January 1994 to December 1994.  I'm -- I was asking why the RPF in power insisted in putting that -- putting that in the constitution, that the genocide against the Tutsis started on 1st October 1990, a date on which the war started in Rwanda.  

When I challenged all that -- I asked why they were refusing.  They said that is -- that is the way it is.  I was already here.  I had already fled.  

It is true -- and at that time it was said -- being referred to as the genocide against the Rwandan -- they had not revised the constitution to start -- to say that it's the genocide against the Tutsi.  So they said the genocide against the Tutsis started in 1st October 1990.  

So it's for all of you doing this work to find out why there is that contradiction.  

What I do know, and which I can confirm, is that the war against Rwanda was organised and planned outside Rwanda.  And it is that war -- it was the excesses of that war that led to genocide.  So if those -- those who planned and organised that war should have the courage to stand up to their responsibilities and say that they were at -- responsible for the tragedy against Rwanda. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Gakwaya, I have a last question.  You were an opponent of the MRND.  Why did you accept to testify in a trial of the chairman of the MRND? 
A.	Once again, it's a question that I probably would not characterise as relevant.  In a democratic process it is not because somebody is in the -- is an opponent that you should put at his doorstep all the negative things that happened in the country.  

Mathieu was a member of the MRND.  I heard a lot of criticisms against the MRND.  But I don't think that we should create, imagine, or falsify acts to prove that the MRND should be condemned.  Politically, there are acts that will allow you to carry out a political battle without being hateful, without being a -- lies.  

So I came here not to defend Ngirumpatse or the MRND but to defend the truth, what I lived, what I saw in my country.  If that will lead to the revelation that Mathieu was not part of that tragedy in its initiation, then he would have benefited from my presence here. 
Q.	Mr. Gakwaya, thank you.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I respected -- I kept my examination-in-chief within the 20 minutes.  And I'm done. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much, Mr. Weyl.  

I think this might be a good time to take our mid-morning recess now.  

Mr. Sow, what -- do you intend to put any questions to this witness?  
MR. SOW: 
Yes, Mr. President.  But I can assure you it will be about ten minutes, and even that will depend on the first answer I get. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Thank you. 

We take the mid-morning recess now.
(Court recessed from 1053H to 1123H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yeah.  Mr. Witness, you now have to respond to Mr. Sow, who will be questioning you on behalf of Math -- of Édouard Karemera.
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.  As the President has said, my name is Moussa Félix Sow.  I represent Édouard Karemera.  
A.	I understand.  Thank you. 
Q.	Mr. Weyl asked you questions which I wanted to ask you.  So I will not repeat those questions.  However, there is a question which interests me.  

And in view of the fact that you said that you remained in Rwanda up to 2001, I would like to ask you something about a ceremony which occurred on the 7th of April 1978 (sic).  Were you aware of that ceremony?  It was a ceremony presided over by President Bizimungu on the 7th of April 1998.  And during that ceremony President Bizimungu decorated what were referred to as some survivors of Bisesero.  Do you remember that ceremony?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel for Édouard Karemera.  Unfortunately, I cannot give you an answer.  Because at that time -- at that ceremony the party's president or chairman, who was the prime minister, Mr. Népomuscène Nzahera (sic), represented PDC (sic) at the ceremony.  

So, more specifically, I cannot answer you, specifically in respect of what happened in relation to Bisesero.  

But speaking about the information and documention (sic) centre on genocide, I participated in an 
ICTR session when ICTR members went to Bisesero.  I went there as the representative of LIPRODHOR.  That was my first time to go to Bisesero since the building of the memorial to honour genocide survivors.  And there was a trial against the former Mabanza bourgmestre.  

In spite of the suffering, when you look at how Bisesero is built, it really is something very mazy.  It's like a labyrinth where you have to go right and then go left in order -- however, what worried me is that during my break I had a drink at the chief of cellule's place in the cellule where the memorial was built.  When I wanted to relax outside -- as you know how African dwellings are made -- I noticed that behind that house there was a tomb -- a grave.  

I asked him, "Why didn't you -- didn't you want these remains to be buried at the Bisesero memorial?"  He gave me an analysis which really bothered me because he told me, "This is my mother's grave." 
MR. SENDZE:
Sorry to interrupt you.  I'm quite confused.  I don't know what question the witness is answering.  I thought he was asked if he knows about a ceremony that took place on the 7th of April 1998.  So his answer doesn't really relate to the question.  So I'm wondering if he should be allowed to continue.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you...(no interpretation)
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, s'il vous plaît.  
MR. SOW:
Prosecution Counsel, I think that the witness has answered the question by saying that he did not attend the ceremony.  He wanted to inform the Trial Chamber of what he knows, because it's obvious that he knew about the ceremony from another source and he knew about what had happened in Bisesero.  And I believe that he's talking about those things.  

So if he can provide us information on those things, it will be a good thing.  However, I'll have to ask the witness to be concise, because basically, that was the only issue that interests me. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  When we talk about the Rwandan tragedy, it's not always easy to confine yourself to what the lawyers want, because Bisesero is a memorial for the entire country.  

So when you said that people who were -- were given awards for saving people at Bisesero, I remembered something, and I wanted to share what I remembered with you.  But if it's not of interest to you, then I'll stop there.  Thank you. 

BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, last question.  It is true that you did not attend that ceremony.  But did you know well the people who were awarded? 
A.	I did not know them.  And the -- the ceremony was in Kigali; whereas, I was in Bugarama.  And then I was in circumstances which did not allow me to even watch the ceremony on TV for me to be able to -- for me to be able to know whether -- anyone of those people being awarded. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I have no further questions. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Sow. 

Mr. Witness, you're now going to have to be cross-examined by the Prosecutor.  And you'll have to respond to questions from the Prosecutor. 
MR. SENDZE:
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours, and every other person in the courtroom.  

I have asked Mr. Issa, to assist me -- distribute the prior testimony of the witness in the Munyakazi trial on Wednesday, 16th September 2009, excerpts of that testimony in French and in English. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Waka (sic).  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	You were a founding member and part of the leadership of the PSD party in Rwanda.  Can you tell us whether the PSD was represented outside Kigali.  PDC.  Sorry.  PDC.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  PDC was represented outside Kigali -- outside Kigali but not in Kigali.  I told you it's a new party.  Where you had membership, you try to create a grass-roots cellule.  So we had some bases in Kibungo, Cyangugu, and Gisenyi. 
Q.	And you also had a PSD leadership at the national level in Kigali.  You had the chairman and a vice-chairman; correct? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel. 
Q.	And it can be said that the chairman and the vice-chairman of the PSD at the national level had some responsibility over the activities of the PDC party in Kibungo and the other préfectures where the PDC existed; correct? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel, for the clarifications.  At the national level there was the political bureau.  And I was a member of that.  He is the one who gave the -- outlined the major principles.  

But when we go to the préfectures and we present our political programme, people write us to say that they accept to be members of our party.  And we ask them to organise themselves.  Because at the grass roots we wanted it to be a new party and local -- based on local initiative, because we wanted -- we were in opposition to the party states where instructions came from above.  

So in the grass-roots cells, they had virtual autonomy for as long as their activities were within the broad frameworks of the PDC.  We gave the broad conceptual framework and left the grass-roots cells to organise themselves.  Thank you. 
Q.	Yes.  But the -- the leadership in Kigali worked together with the leadership in Kibungo, for example.  That's all I am asking.  Yes or no?  
A.	That was not the case.  The bureau had to ensure that those who were members of the -- of the party did not behave in a way that was at variance with the principles of the party.  

So at the local and préfectoral level, it was the activities of the local people.  We did not intervene at the top in terms of dictating their activities. 
Q.	Are you testifying that following the structural organisation of the PDC party the chairman of the PDC at the national level had nothing to do with the PDC party in Kibungo, for example?  Nothing at all? 
A.	I thought I had sufficiently explained myself.  I said they were free in their activities.  Our role was to make sure that their statements -- there were programmes on -- Rwandan national programme.  And the national leadership would set out the ideological principles of the party.  

After that we would receive letters from people and -- people who come and tell us that they were interested in our programme.  And we will send them to organise themselves and tell them when they have sufficient number of membership to be able to work properly they should come back and tell us.  

And where it was possible and when we received applications that -- this or that party is going to organise a rally in Kibungo or elsewhere, we would ask those people to attend and to see -- to compare what they were going to say, their activities with ours.  

So that is our -- we had that oversight.  But that did not mean that we had the direct authority to direct their activities. 
Q.	So this role of overseer is what was played by Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Mr. Édouard Karemera, who were both leaders of the MRND party at the national level.  Do we agree? 
A.	I don't know how the MRND was structured at that level.  First of all, MRND used to be a party state.  But the new MRND was a new party which was part of the democratic process and which had set up its institutions.  

I did not know how it operated from top to bottom.  What I'm -- the answer I'm giving is in respect of the PSD (sic) and not the MRND. 
Q.	It is a fact of common knowledge that the Interahamwe were the youth wing of the MRND party.  You would agree with me that this youth wing existed in Bugarama? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  When you say that it was common knowledge that the MRND youth wing -- 
Q.	Respond to the question.  The MRND youth wing, the Interahamwe, existed in Bugarama; correct? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Please remember to answer in French since that is the language you have chosen to testify in.  
A.	Okay.  Yes.  Yes.  

I'm sorry, once again, for mixing up the languages.  Sometimes I try to speak Kinyarwanda.  But I'm -- apologise for that.  I will try.  Thank you. 
Q.	Thank you.  And these Interahamwe were, of course, linked to the MRND party structure in Bugarama; correct? 
A.	I am not able to establish a link of authority between the officials of the party in Bugarama and the Interahamwe.  What I observed is that in rallies there were young persons who undertook protocol activities who sing and entertain the rally.  They call themselves the Interahamwe youth wing of the MRND.  But I'm not able to establish the link of authority between the party of those people because I was not part of their internal structure arrangements.  

I attended their rallies.  I saw their activities.  I attended the rallies when I had time, and I used to see them.  It's not only for MRND but the other parties who had youth wings affiliated to the ideology -- who were interested in the ideology of their party. 
Q.	Yes.  And that would suggest to you, an observer, that the Interahamwe and the MRND party were working together; right? 
A.	Working together, I think so, because I used to see these young persons when they would come to the rallies and organise the security of persons who were present -- present there.  So I think there was some kind of collaboration.  I don't know if they were working together.  

But I know -- and I know there is a certain link.  I don't know if it's a link of authority or a spontaneous link that flows out of the event.  I'm not able to characterise that link.  I only saw them when there were political rallies.

	1145H 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Who was the leader of the Interahamwe in Bugarama? 
A.	The leader of the Interahamwe in Bugarama, that would depend on the rallies, because I did not attend all the meetings of the MRND, but those meetings that I had the opportunity to attend, I saw one Tarek Aziz who, from all indications, was the most important person in the young persons. 
Q.	Was Tarek Aziz his real name or nickname? 
A.	Because of what happened some people even decided to change their names and some people called themselves or gave themselves the rank of colonel.  Previously, I knew him as Athanase.  But those days I saw people call him Tarek Aziz.  He, himself, referred to himself as Tarek Aziz.  I don't know when he changed his name to Tarek Aziz. 
Q.	So it was a nickname.  Do you know the real life person referred to as Tarek Aziz? 
A.	Yes, I know the person. 
Q.	And you know the brutal reputation of Tarek Aziz, the Iraqi former minister? 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Yes, the reputation of the real life Tarek Aziz of Iraq; do you know him? 
A.	I don't know that.  I heard in the trials that took place in Iraq that there was a group affiliated to Saddam Hussein, but there again I refuse to fall into the trap of the media which played up events in Iraq.  So I do not know the reputation ascribed to Tarek Aziz. 
Q.	Tarek Aziz was a member of the MRND party; do you confirm? 
A.	I told you that the Tarek Aziz that I know, who used to be called Athanase, I used to know him as Athanase.  But in MRND rallies he was referred to as Tarek Aziz.  Back home, it is very easy to change religion overnight, and change your name.  So I don't know if he had changed his religion to Islam.  So I don't know if the name that he had had any relationship with -- any link to the Tarek Aziz of Iraq, because even at that time the Iraqi war was not so well known across the world.  The Tarek Aziz you are referring to, that name and Saddam Hussein's band came up subsequent to the events that you are talking about. 
Q.	Sorry, I think my question was not very clear.  When I asked about Tarek Aziz belonging to the MRND party, I'm referring to the Tarek Aziz in Bugarama; did he belong to the MRND party? 
A.	Difficult to say.  He used to wear the uniform of the MRND.  I used to see him as a part of the protocol group of the MRND, but I don't know if he was a card-bearing member of the party or whether they just drafted him in to assist during rallies.  I don't know if he was a member, but I knew him as somebody who was a part of the youth wing, who was affiliated to the ideologies of the party.  But I never saw his party membership card.  Thank you.  
Q.	It is true, is it not, that it was under the leadership of this Tarek Aziz that the Interahamwe perpetrated acts of killing against the Tutsi in Bugarama? 
A.	Bugarama is an entire commune.  I was not able to witness or check on everything that happened in the commune but, rather, CIMERWA where I used to work, there was indeed an attack during which several persons were killed.  I believe that if I were there on that day, I may have been one of them.  So, I don't know how the attackers attacked CIMERWA but I got there just when they were killing, using guns.  And I was being told that the person who led the attackers was Tarek.  But on that day I did not see him but I was still in hiding.  We were all traumatised.  

The information that I gathered soon after was to the effect that those who launched the attack on CIMERWA were led by Tarek Aziz.  But in other localities it was also known that Tarek Aziz was someone who was capable of doing anything.  And even me -- he swindled me, took some money from me.  He would go to any household, so he was a person who is capable of doing anything.  If he killed people somewhere, it is possible, but in Bugarama CIMERWA, I was told that he was leading the attack. 
Q.	You were told he led the attack by Interahamwes at CIMERWA on the 16th of April 1994.  That is exactly what you were told; right? 
A.	Those who attacked CIMERWA, the group of attackers -- I'm talking about the group of attackers not a group of Interahamwe, because I was told that among the attackers they were able to identify one Barundi, who was a refugee in Bugarama who was part of the group of attackers.  Since he was Barundi and he was a member of that group of attackers, so I cannot say that this group was 100 per cent Interahamwe.  That's why I prefer to call them a group of attackers.  But I was told that the leader of the group was Aziz.  But among the attackers I'm told that there were refugees who were living in Bugarama since it's neighbouring to -- a neighbouring commune to Burundi.  

So in the group of attackers there were people who were not Rwandans.  So I'm not able to say they were Interahamwe. 
Q.	Witness, in the Munyakazi trial, you specifically referred to this group of attackers as the Interahamwe.  Why are you shying away from referring to them in that same light today?  I have the transcripts in my hand.  
A.	Specifically so, I'm not refusing.  I have just told you that the group of attackers, when they arrived -- when they arrived I was not there.  I was told that it was led by one Tarek Aziz that I knew as a leader of the MRND group in the locality.  But I'm telling you today that not only was there that group but there were other persons that I probably did not know at the time.  

Let me add -- let me tell you how, under what conditions what --
Q.	Sorry, it's okay.  I don't want to discuss the details of the attack.  All I want to ascertain is that the Interahamwe were among the persons who attacked CIMERWA on the 16th of April 1994; simple.  
A.	Yes, there were Interahamwes and other persons -- with other persons in the group. 
Q.	Thank you.  In your evidence-in-chief, you also discussed fabrication of evidence in the prisons.  You said there was a group of criminals who had occupied the homes of certain persons.  And in order to remain in occupation of those homes, they were asked to make false allegations against the owners of the homes.  That is what you testified to; correct? 
A.	No.  I said that after the takeover that there were some people who abandoned their properties and that those who came occupied their houses, their properties.  Those who came were not criminals; they were normally soldiers of the RPF.  These were people who live in neighbouring countries and who were coming back and who took advantage of their affinity to the new political leadership to occupy houses of other persons.  

This -- it is among these newcomers that they were able to find -- people would recruit those in charge of investigating the genocide.  What I said was that when the person who is supposed to carry out the investigations is living in the house of another person, he took advantage of this guilty plea to incriminate to the owner of the house or his heirs.  And that becomes an argument to use to continue occupying the property of another person.  That is what I said.  If it was not clear, then I think the correction should be made now.  Thank you. 
Q.	Were the homes of Mr. Ngirumpatse and Mr. Karemera occupied in this manner? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I don't know the houses of Ngirumpatse or Karemera.  These are public figures that I had the opportunity to meet and got to know during our meetings.  So I wouldn't know if their properties were occupied after 1994.  I don't even know if -- well, in fact, each person has his individual story, so I don't know if their properties were taken over by the newcomers.  Thank you.  
Q.	So it is true or possible that this level of fabrication that you have discussed had nothing to do with Mr. Karemera and Mr. Ngirumpatse, whose homes were not occupied in this manner? 
A.	I gave an example to indicate how this new concept was used in an abusive manner.  But it was not only to occupy the property of persons.  It could also be used for political means.  So these accusations were used for various motives.  It was not limited to the appropriation of properties of people.  I told you that before, even settling scores using this method which ought to have helped us to determine the real perpetrators but this method was used in -- for various interests. 
Q.	Mr. Rwaka, have you been following up the evidence in this trial? 
A.	The evidence?  I came here yesterday before this Court so I did not follow the presentation of evidence. 
Q.	So you are not aware of the identity or testimonies of any Prosecution witness who has testified in this trial; is that correct?
A.	I do not know. 
Q.	You are not aware of all the specific allegations that have been made against Mr. Karemera and Mr. Ngirumpatse in the indictment in this case; correct? 
A.	I clearly stated that in my country there was a movement for the fabrication.  Yes, I'm answering your question.  
Q.	Excuse me.  No, you're not answering my question.  

Are you aware of the specific allegations made against the Accused in this case?  That is the question.  
A.	I'm not aware of the charges brought against Karemera and Ngirumpatse.  But what I do know is this:  That the fabrication of false allegations does exist in my country.  Thank you. 
Q.	You do not know the identities or the content of the testimonies of Prosecution witnesses who have testified in the trial.  You also do not know the allegations that have been made against the Accused in this case.  You are, therefore, in no position to suggest to the Trial Chamber that any Prosecution witness who has testified before them in this matter may have fabricated the evidence that they gave; is that correct? 
A.	My contribution before the Court is to indicate that this process of fabrication of false allegations that exist, it is for the Judges and for counsel to determine whether there were witnesses who may have fallen into that trap.  But my contribution was to tell you that that does exist.  Thank you.  
Q.	Generally, but not in relation to Prosecution witnesses who have testified in this case before this Trial Chamber; confirmed? 
A.	I do not agree, Counsel, and le me tell you why.  Karemera and Ngirumpatse are special cases.  There was a time you were even talking about big fish.  Now, if this process applies to the smaller fish, the underlings, then I'm saying that there's no reason it should not apply to Ngirumpatse or Karemera. 
Q.	Are you willing to suggest before this Chamber that anybody who made a confession and a guilty plea in Rwanda, either following the Gacaca process or any other legal process, was not telling the truth in their confession; can you state that as a fact? 
A.	No, Counsel.  There are those who did it and those who refused to do so.  So I will not say that it's a principle, that there's no change.  There are individuals who accepted to do so, and there are some people who were against that procedure.  

The problem in the Rwandan issue is that people always generalise.  I'm only saying that it does exist.  Thank you. 
Q.	Yeah, and that seems to be the problem with your testimony.  You're also generalising.  When I try to bring you to the specific matters that relate to the case you take me back to generalities.  So there were some confessions and guilty pleas in Rwanda that contained the truth; that was possible, right? 
A.	(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Microphone, please.  
THE WITNESS: 
It is true that one cannot say that all those who pleaded guilty were part of this procedure that I described.  What I'm saying is that this procedure is often used, that is not to say that everyone, anyone who pleaded guilty was part of that plot.  There are people who may plead guilty and continue telling the truth. 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Thank you.  Yesterday, in your evidence-in-chief, you said that when multipartyism was introduced in Rwanda, you and a few others decided not to remain with the MRND because members of the MRND party continued to refer to the history of the country in their discourse.  What did you mean by that, when you talked about reference to the history of Rwanda? 
A.	That question will take a long time to answer.  Rwanda's history is an ancient history, the struggle for power between Hutus and Tutsis since the days of the monarchy, the various republics and even up to now.  So if we start talking about it we will not finish it.  

There were parties which had a historical background such as MDR which did not want to change its name.  People did not want to change the name.  So people who were faithful to that name said they should not change the name because they didn't want to accept new concepts.  

However, MRND, even after going to the grass roots, decided to retain its name, maybe for political strategic reasons, but we at PDC moved forward by establishing something new.  So when I talk about old concepts, I'm talking about people who did not want to change the names of their parties.  So as far as we are concerned they did not want to change the names of their parties because they did not want to accept the new democratic landscape.  That's what I meant. 
Q.	That seems to me to relate to the history of a political party and not the history of Rwanda.  Is it possible that reference to the 1959 revolution was one of those historical facts that you could have been referring to when you talked about the history of Rwanda? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I would like to request the Presiding Judge of this Trial Chamber to prevent the proceedings from turning into a history of Rwanda.  You see, Rwanda did not start existing since 1959 or '64 or 1994.  Rwanda has existed for a long time.  So if you ask me about the history I will not start with 1959, I will start even a very, very long time before that.  Thank you.  
Q.	Witness, do not address your mind to issues I did not put to you.  I was simply trying to find out from you if, when you talked about reference to the history of Rwanda, you could have been referring to the 1959 revolution as one of those events.  It is either a yes or a no. 
A.	The 1959 revolution -- just like in all countries in the world -- was an event in the history of our country.  So I don't know what you want.  Do you want to know the reasons for that revolution, its consequences on the social life of the country?  I don't know.  What do you really want me to tell you?  Otherwise, you have to be clear in your question. 
Q.	Let me help you.  When you testified that you and others preferred not to remain within the MRND party because the MRND continued to refer to the history of the country, was your reason for leaving the fact that the references made to the history of Rwanda were considered offensive by you and the others who did not join the MRND party? 
A.	Thank you.  Since you've assisted me, let me also help you and to tell you that MRND exists only since 1975.  So it is nothing to do with the 1959 revolution.  

When I talked about political opposition parties and tell you that our platform was based in a way on -- platform -- because MDR was involved in the 1959 revolution, but MRND exists only since 1975.  So I cannot connect MRND with the 1959 events because the MRND was founded in 1975.  
Q.	As a Rwandan and as a politician in Rwanda, do you consider references to the events of 1959 offensive? 
A.	The 1959 revolution is not offensive to me at all because that was the beginning of the democratic struggle in Rwanda, and it was not the only revolution that took place in Rwanda because there was the Rucunshu process, or revolution.  So all claims made, demands made in a certain period in history was part of the democratic process, because people revolted specifically because they wanted liberty.  So that cannot offend me. 
Q.	In your evidence, you seem to blame the RPF for everything that happened in Rwanda; is that the case? 
A.	Yes, that is the case. 
Q.	Could that position that you take today be motivated by the fact that you were stripped of your ministerial portfolios within the RPF government? 
A.	I think that I have adequately explained that I was not in the government because RPF wanted to do that -- me to do that.  I was there because my party wanted me to be in the government.  So, I cannot regret the fact that I joined a government with the backing of my party.  

Secondly, the accusing thing you're referring to in relation to that, I have to tell you, since 1990 there was a war.  And that war culminated in the tragedy that concerns us here today.  

So, the genesis of today's case was the war started against Rwanda in 1990.  RPF as the ruling party promulgated it in its -- that in its 2003 constitution.  So, I want you to know those things. 
Q.	But it is not the RPF who told Tarek Aziz and his Interahamwe to kill Tutsis in Bugarama; correct? 
A.	Prosecutor, I think that people have to assume their responsibilities from the ground upwards.  When you form an ethnic war -- army, and then that ethnic army attacks the country you can say that that's your right.  But you also have to think about the consequences which might arise from your actions and assume responsibility for that -- for those consequences.  

The war started in -- on 1st of October 1990, and in the course of the war led to consequences which culminated in a tragedy -- in a tragedy.  I'm not saying that RPF told people to go and kill Tutsis, MRND did not tell people to go and kill Tutsis.  But there was a war which lasted for more than four years.  It galvanised the tribal hatred that had been in existence for a long time.  
At the end of the day, we fell in total chaos and no one could stop the process which had been started.  So I don't want to say that RPF was responsible for all those deeds.  The RPF was founded because they were also victims of the past events in Rwanda.  

The reason why I pointed out at some facts regarding RPF was to explain to you and the Court why the Court -- to explain to the Court why we had the events that occurred in 1994.  But my motive was not to explain the entire history of Rwanda. 
Q.	Yes, so the RPF created an ethnic army, attacked Rwanda and should, therefore, take responsibility for what happened after the attack.  

In the same light, the MRND created the Interahamwe and should, therefore, take responsibility for what the Interahamwe did during the genocide.  We are agreed on that general principle? 
A.	I clearly said that with regard to the Interahamwes or MRND I don't know any figure of authority who was in it.  But between -- with regard to RPF and its army there was a direct command between the RPF and its army.  So, you could see even now on international media that they had a command structure which was well structured and shared responsibilities.  So, I cannot really accept that comparison. 
Q.	Well, for your information the Interahamwe was led by Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Édouard Karemera and others.  
MR. SENDZE: 
Mr. President, I have nothing more to put to the witness.  
BY MR. SENDZE: 
Q.	Thank you for answering my questions, and I wish you a safe trip back to your home.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Prosecutor. 
MR. WITNESS: 
Thank you, Prosecutor.  

I'm satisfied with the fact that somewhere -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Your testimony is not quite finished yet.  You may still have to respond to questions to be put by Mr. Weyl in redirect.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I don't have any questions in re-examination.  But as is usual, I'd like to thank the witness for having come here to help you ascertain the truth and, as usual, I'd like to apply to your Chamber, if it so wishes -- I would like to request the Chamber to allow the witness to visit the Accused here.  In any case, I'm speaking about my client, Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  So with your leave, could you order the registry to take the necessary measures?  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, your testimony is now completed and we thank you, as we do all witnesses, for assisting the Trial Chamber with its work.  You're now excused and you're free to go.  

The registrar will make arrangements to facilitate the request made by counsel.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Defence Counsel.  Thank you, Prosecutor for having heard me.  I hope that I've made a modest contribution to -- to this Tribunal so that we -- that the tragedy in our country is not reproduced anywhere.  And also to make sure that the guilty people are punished but the innocent people are released -- acquitted and released.  

I would like to request the Presiding Judge to allow me to visit Mr. Sagahutu, if this is acceptable.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, thank you.  We exercise control really over the persons in this trial.  Any further requests must be made to the registrar with the assistance of the WVSS.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
(Witness excused)
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, for the record, I would like to respond to a question pending from yesterday regarding Witness PR's documents.  I think that it would be really simple if we apply the same rules applicable to Prosecution exhibits.  In other words, we apply the same rules to our Defence documents and that it doesn't have to be under seal but rather what should be done is to use an acronym or pseudonym. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Registrar, can I make the order without (inaudible)?  
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Yes, Mr. President it would be attended to.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  And the order is made accordingly.

Mr. Webster, I was not certain if your comments this morning were an indication that there might be no cross-examination of the next witness. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
No -- no, Your Honour, we would still seek to cross-examine this witness.  If we had -- if the situation had developed that we got to 3:30 and we didn't have an opportunity, then we would consider relinquishing our right to cross-examination.  But since we do have time this afternoon we'd wish to proceed.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Microphones overlapping) 

That's something I was trying to work out.  How long would the cross-examination last?  Is it something we should do before lunch or?  We have five minutes before the luncheon recess.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
It should be around 40 minutes or so in cross-examination.  

If the Court wants to use this time profitably I can deal with other issues, and then we can -- even if we don't finish them before we break, we can come back to them this afternoon.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, the question that we're considering:  Why shouldn't we hold you to the undertaking you made that the cross-examination of both of these witnesses would have taken about an hour?  We'd really preferred to have completed this before lunch if it is possible --  
MR. WEBSTER: 
And then come -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
-- and then do the status conference this afternoon.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Well, we can try.  We can bring the witness in and we can see as far as we get.  We did have a late start after the morning break, so I think everyone is energised enough to continue for another 15 or 20 minutes.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We take it that you think that the cross-examination can be completed now in the time you just mentioned.  In that case, we could let the witness come in and then we could come in this afternoon and do the status conference, which is what really we would prefer to do. 

MR. WEBSTER: 
Thank you.  So I will allow my colleague to take over.  She's cross-examining the witness and we will see how fast we move to -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, would that be an acceptable arrangement that we complete the testimony of this witness now and all that would be left this afternoon would be the status conference that has been proposed?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I mean, in view of what you have said we don't have any objection.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I have to say that the next witness is Witness PBR and he says he will testify openly and waive the protection measures.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Mr. President, we think that the witness doesn't have his earphones on. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, I've noticed that.  I will just allow the registrar to assist him.  

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS: 
Good afternoon, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The Chamber had made an order, a protective order in your favour for security reasons.  But we've been advised by counsel that the situations have changed and that you now wish to testify openly as an unprotected witness.  Now, what is your position, please.  
THE WITNESS: 
That is correct, Mr. President.  I've decided to testify openly.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Have you testified in any other cases of the Tribunal? 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you testify as a protected witness in those cases? 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes.  I was a protected witness in the very first trial I testified here.  But in my -- on the second occasion I testified openly.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So in those circumstances we are at liberty now to revoke the protective order that we made against you, and you will now testify as an unprotected witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The registrar will now assist you to take an oath to tell the truth.  
(Declaration made by Aminadab Iyakaremye in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, Witness, you have been brought here to be cross-examined on the written statement that you made before the Court.  Both the Prosecutor and counsel, Mr. Weyl, will now introduce you to the Chamber.  
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, I thought I'd made a slip, which you -- when I -- I did not refer to you as counsel representing Mathieu Ngirumpatse, but I do so now.  
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
AMINADAB IYAKAREMYE,
first having been duly sworn, 
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. WEYL: 
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I would like you to tell the Trial Chamber what is your name, and please spell your name for the record.  
A.	I thank you.  My name is Iyakaremye, Aminadab.  
Q.	Can you, please, kindly spell it? 
A.	I-K-E-R-I-Y-A-K-A-R-E-M-Y-E (sic) that is my family name.  Then you have Aminadab, A-M-I-N-D-A-B (sic). 
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Iyakaremye.  Can you please tell us your date of birth? 
A.	I was born on the 25th of December 1960. 
Q.	Mr. Iyakaremye, I would now request you to carefully read the information sheet before you which is entitled "Personal identification sheet".  Check for any errors.  If you -- if there are no errors you date the document.  Today is 25 November 2010.  And after dating it, please, sign it. 
(Pages 29 to 40 by Eleanor Bastian)




























1240H 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. Issa, please forgive me.  I thought the witness already had the document before him.  I'm confused.  
THE WITNESS:
What is the date today? 
MR. WEYL:
25 November 2010.  

Mr. President, I kindly request the Chamber to admit into evidence the witness's 
personal identification sheet on the -- the number that Issa gave me, kindly as usual.  That would be number 189, D. NG189. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted into evidence.  
(Exhibit No. D. NG189 admitted)  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I would also like to request the Chamber to admit into evidence under number 190, 
that is, D. NG190, the written statement of Mr. Iyakaremye. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted as well.  
(Exhibit No. D. NG190 admitted)
MR. WEYL:
I thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. Iyakaremye, my role stops here.  Your written statement is available to the Prosecution, and it is now for the Prosecution counsel to put to you questions -- questions in cross-examination.  I thank you, Witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  As Counsel Weyl has explained to you, the main purpose for coming here is to be cross-examined by the Prosecutor.  And you'll now have to respond to questions from the Prosecutor.  
MS. WILSON:
Good -- good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours, members of the Defence team and to 
everyone else in court. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	Good morning to you, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel for the Prosecution. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I should join in with the witness and remind you that it's long past midday. 
MS. WILSON:
Very well.  Mr. President, if I may quickly explain the exhibits, which I have in fact distributed.  I've distributed six exhibits.  And as indicated on a cover sheet, each of the exhibits are in the 
three languages, except the last two.  One document is in Kinyarwanda only, and there are transcripts associated with that in English and French.  And the number 6 exhibit is in English and French.  So I take it everyone will have that.  
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, good afternoon to you again.  And I simply have a few questions to ask you.  I would ask that you try to just answer my questions as directly as you could.  Are you clear with that? 
A.	I agree with you entirely, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you leave Rwanda on the 11th of April 1994?  
A.	I was in Rwanda, Counsel.  
Q.	Can you tell me what date you left Rwanda in 1994. 
A.	I left Rwanda in the month of July 1994, and I crossed the border post at Gisenyi.  
Q.	Thank you.  Since leaving Rwanda in July of 1994, have you since returned? 
A.	No, I have not returned to Rwanda.  
Q.	Is the reason for your -- is the reason that you have not returned due to the fact that there are charges pending against you at the Gacaca court for crimes relating to the genocide? 
A.	No, that is not the reason.  
Q.	But, Mr. Witness, you are, in fact, aware that there are charges pending against you at the 
Gacaca court in Rwanda?  
A.	Counsel, I was informed of those allegations here at the Tribunal and not anywhere else.  
MS. WILSON:
May I refer the Chamber to exhibit number 5 and the accompanying transcripts in 
English and French.  The transcripts were, in fact, taken from the Setako trial on the 
16th of June 19 -- 2009.  

Mr. Issa, could you please provide the witness with this document.  Thank you.  
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	Witness, do you see your name on that document? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  I can see my name on it.  
Q.	And you agree that they refer to charges that are pending against you at the Gatsata Gacaca court in Rwanda.  
A.	Yes, that's correct.  I am saying that these negotiations -- rather, these allegations were brought to my knowledge here at the Tribunal, and I wonder whether you can attest to the authenticity of this document.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, I wonder if you could stay with me.  Just, if you could, simply answer my questions and then we can move on smoothly.  

And these charges are written in Kinyarwanda.  And they are detailed at A, B, C, D and F, as indicated at page 56 of the English transcript.  And if I may quickly read the charges that are pending against you:  
"A" is for "planning of genocide; B, organising the genocide; C, incitement to commit genocide; 
D, supervision and superintendence of genocide; F, killings committed with zeal."  

Do you see that on that document, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Yes, I can see that.  I have seen it.  
Q.	And those charges are still pending against you? 
A.	I am not aware of that.  
Q.	But you, in fact, accept you saw your name on that document? 
A.	Yes.  I can see my name on the document.  
MS. WILSON:
Mr. President, with your leave, could this document be admitted into evidence?  It might be of assistance also to admit the transcripts which translate them in English and French from the Setako proceedings.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, at this stage I have difficulties seeing both the relevance and the foundation of what the Prosecution says.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, we think they should be admitted as a credibility issue.  So we'll admit the documents into evidence.  
MR. MJUI:
The document will be P. 556, A for French, B for English.  Thank you, Your Honour. 
(Exhibit No. P. 556A, P. 556B and P. 556C admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MS. WILSON:
Just to make it clear, the actual charge is also to be admitted, and that is in Kinyarwanda.  And the transcripts explain the -- the charges and they're both -- one is in English, and one is in French.  So if they could all be admitted together, I would really appreciate that.  
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you -- do you have a copy of your statement that you certified in front of you?  
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	You do? 
A.	I have the document before me, Counsel.  
Q.	Now, do you mind reading the second paragraph of that statement, please.  Do you -- if I may ask you, do you read French?  I think you're speaking in Kinyarwanda.  Do you -- 
A.	Yes, I read French.  
Q.	Okay.  Can you please read the second paragraph of your statement, please, beginning with 
"J'ai participé aux réunions de création participation..."
A.	"I participated in the meeting creating the Interahamwe, and I was an active member of the MRND party; moreover, it was in that capacity that I attended several meetings of the party in Ruhengeri, Nyamirambo and elsewhere."
Q.	Mr. Witness, from what you've read, would you agree that you were, in fact, a member of the Interahamwe? 
A.	No.  I was not at all an Interahamwe.  From what I have read, it emerges that I attended a meeting as an observer; therefore, I was not an Interahamwe.  
Q.	So you were an active member of the MRND, and you were merely an observer, you said, of the Interahamwe...(microphones overlapping)
A.	Nibyo.  
Q.	But despite saying that you're not a member...(microphones overlapping)
A.	I was a member of the MRND; however, I was not a member of the association called Interahamwe.  
I was a member of the renovated MRND.  
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, despite the fact that you say that you were not a member of the Interahamwe, you go on in the following two paragraphs to tell us about the Interahamwe.  Do you see those two paragraphs where you speak about the objective of the creation of the Interahamwe?  And the following one, that the Interahamwe -- they did not envisage the massacre of Tutsis.  Do you see those two paragraphs in your statement? 
A.	Yes, I can see the paragraphs you have referred to.  I was a Rwandan citizen; I lived in Kigali.  It happened that I found myself at a place where a meeting had been held.  I heard what was being said.  
I was not a member of the Interahamwe.  I went to attend that meeting as an observer.  As a 
Rwandan citizen I went to the site of the meeting to see what the people who had assembled there were doing.  So I repeat -- 
Q.	Mr. Witness -- 
A.	I'm repeating what was said at that meeting or at that site. 
Q.	Okay.  I understand you now.  
A.	I thank you.  
Q.	So it's only as a result of attending one meeting that you -- you say what the objectives were and what the intention of the Interahamwe group was?  
A.	As I explained in my statement, I was present at two meetings -- two meetings of -- by those people.  From what I observed, I noticed that they were young people who wanted to work for the interests of the MRND for the purpose of recruiting new MRND members.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you agree attending -- that only attending two minutes -- two meetings -- sorry -- is not a sufficient basis for which -- on which you could make -- should make pronouncements about the Interahamwe? 
A.	That is your opinion.  But to my knowledge that is what I was able to observe.  Furthermore, I saw what was happening.  I realised that those young people were carrying out propaganda on behalf of the MRND in peace and unity.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you please read the paragraph that begins "Les Interahamwe" which is 
paragraph number 4 in your statement.  
A.	Very well...(no interpretation)  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry.  We're not able to follow the witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
They don't have a copy of the statement. 
MS. WILSON:
This is the will-say.  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	Excuse me, Mr. Witness.  Do you mind reading that paragraph again -- it's only three lines -- and reading it slowly so that the interpreters could follow you.  
A.	I believe I've read the paragraph that you indicated.  Is there another paragraph? 
Q.	Mr. Witness, if you -- if you bear with us.  For the purpose of translation -- interpretation, we need you to reread the passage that begins with "Les Interahamwe" -- that is, the fourth paragraph of your statement.  
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Slowly.  
A.	"The Interahamwe would never have envisaged urging for the killing of the Tutsi, particularly since there are Tutsis among them.  They did not receive orders from the MRND nor from their 
administrative authorities because they were not organised.  They were an independent organisation."
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  So you're saying, on the basis of attending two meetings, that you came to that conclusion? 
A.	Counsel, that indeed is the case.  But after those meetings I was able to speak to a number of persons and we discussed, but officially, I was present at those two meetings.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Were you a member of the MRND in 1993 when the congress was held? 
A.	That is true.  
MS. WILSON:
I now refer to document number 1 in my list of exhibits. 
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	Now, Witness, at that congress several recommendations were, in fact, made.  And at 
paragraph 13 in the English version -- it states "Any other business" -- they deal with the MRND Interahamwe.  So the English one is the first document and the French follows that -- the English version.  So at paragraph 13, under "Any other business" is headed "MRND Interahamwe."  

The first question I would like to ask you is -- is, you claim that the Interahamwe was independent of the MRND.  That's what you say, correct? 
A.	(Microphones overlapping)
Q.	But here we have -- 
A.	Yes, that is the case.  
Q.	But here we have at the congress under "Any other business" the first thing -- the first subheading is "MRND Interahamwe."  From the very title of "MRND Interahamwe," won't you admit that there's some sort of relationship between the MRND and the Interahamwe? 
A.	As you said, Counsel, the congress was organised.  Not all members were present -- present at the congress.  I don't know.  But as I said -- and, if you listen to me, I was saying that these were 
young persons who had gathered together and were working for the MRND, particularly in the recruitment of new members because this was during the multiparty era.  Therefore, it was an independent group but working for the MRND.  
Q.	If I may quickly read what is stated under that heading.  It states the following:

"Interahamwe was created on the same day as the opposition parties.  Their duty was to inspire MRND members with courage and to spread the party's -- the party's propaganda."  

If I may continue.  

"They have demonstrated that MRND is strong when the opp" --

"...is strong when the opposition parties started to indulge in violence and provocation."

It continues:

"They played an important role in spreading the ideals of the MRND party.  They are therefore worthy of support from the organs of the party."

So here we have a recommendation speaking about the fact that the Interahamwe is worthy of support from other organs of the party.  Do you have anything to say about that? 
A.	I have told you that, to my knowledge, they were an independent group.  Now, if they ben -- if they had support from any of the personalities, that is fine, so you can see them, admire them and support them in one way or another.  So I don't know if it is the MRND that supported them collectively or an individual who, on his own initiative, supported them.  I don't know.  
Q.	Let me continue.  It says that -- it continues to say that:

"However, how their functions fit into the party structure remains problematic, since they seem to collaborate only with the national secretariat with no regard to the" other -- "to the organs of the party."  

So from what I've just read, it has been acknowledged that the MRND collaborated with the national secretariat.  What do you have to say about that? 
A.	Counsel, listen.  You can address that question to those who were working in the national secretariat.  
I was not an employee of the MRND.  I was able to say -- I'm able to assert what I was saying, and that is what is reflected in my statement.  I cannot speak to the other issues.  
Q.	Thank you.  Finally, in the -- in the following paragraph -- I'll just read a part of it:

"...their activities must be known and controlled at every level of the party."  

This is what was stated as a recommendation at the MRND congress.  Do you have anything further 
to say on that point? 
A.	You are saying that this is the resolution that was taken at the congress of the party.  Well, this was not brought to my knowledge.  I'm an ordinary member of the party, so this resolution only binds those who decide -- who took it and drafted the document.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I will now refer to exhibit number 2.  
MS. WILSON:
If the witness could be shown this -- oh, I will, in fact, read it, rather than showing it to him.  

This is a press release of the MRND party, and it was previously tendered as a Defence exhibit, D. NZ33B.  And it's dated the 23rd of April 1994.  
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	In this press release, Mr. Witness, at paragraph 4 of the English version, it states that:

"The MRND party leadership thanks the Interahamwe, the MRND party's youth wing, as well as Interahamwe national committee members for having continued, in collaboration with members of the population, to support the national armed forces to thwart the enemy who constantly asserts his objective to exterminate all Rwandans."  

May I have your comment on that, Mr. Witness, having regard to what you stated about their independence? 
A.	Well, I'm not aware of all those.  You are reading a passage for me, but all those things were not brought to my knowledge.  
Q.	If I may continue in the following paragraph.  

"The MRND high authorities appeal to the Interahamwe national committee to closely monitor the activities of certain Interahamwe members who seems to deviate from their objective to militate for peace and security amongst all Rwandans.  Within the same context, the MRND party leadership constantly urges all MRND militants, in particular, the Interahamwe, to pursue the objective of unity and peace that the father of the nation has bequeathed to" -- them -- "to us."  

Do you have comments to make on that, Mr. Witness? 
A.	My comment is as follows.  As I've already said, the Interahamwe is a group of young persons and they were working for the MRND party.  If an authority or a leader of the MRND was asking them to come back to the party lines, that is laudable.  I have no further comments.  
MS. WILSON:
I now refer the Chamber to exhibit number 3, which is D. NZ35B.  
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	And again, Mr. Witness, I would just like to read one paragraph for you.  The third paragraph -- or the second paragraph after the second "Party Militants," it states:  

"We thank the Interahamwe of MRND for having understood the message sent to them on 23 April 1994.  We also thank the Interahamwe committee which did not hesitate to instruct the 
party youth on how to behave in these difficult times."  

So here, again, we have the MRND.  And the letter was -- the communiqué was sent by Édouard Karemera, thanking the Interahamwe of the MRND.  So do you still maintain the fact that the Interahamwe was, in fact, independent of the MRND? 
A.	In this regard, let me say that Karemera was free to thank the Interahamwe for understanding the instructions that he gave them on account of the fact that some of them had deviated from the party line.  So as a secretary general he's entitled to thank the youth wing for -- or the youth for understanding the message that he sent.  

Now, if you say that somebody was thanking them, it will not mean that they were under his orders.  Maybe he was just giving an opinion on what they should do.  It does not mean that the Interahamwe were under his orders.  
Q.	Finally, Mr. Witness, in relation to your assertion that the Interahamwe was independent of the MRND, I'd like to refer to exhibit number 4 which was previously tendered as D. NZ38, and I am looking at page 19 in the English version.  And this was, in fact, a Radio Rwanda broadcast, and this is the transcript of it.  And this was a statement from the Accused, Ngirumpatse, in relation to the refugees in Hôtel des Mille Collines.  I'm just going to read a small portion on page 19.  It reads as follows: 

"...I request all MRND members, especially the Interahamwe, to let those people go starting today, as the minister has just said.  Let them go wherever they want, whether inside Rwanda or abroad; we should let them leave.  The fact that they may join the Inkotanyi does not create a problem, since the war we are fighting is based on the truth and not on large numbers."  

And it continues in the following two sentences where the Accused, Ngirumpatse, states:  

"I therefore repeat my request that from today, not later than today, those people...members of MRND or members of other parties manning roadblocks...since roadblocks are actually manned by members of different parties...they should let those people leave [Hôtel des] Mille Collines..."  

So I suggest to you, Mr. Witness, after reading all those documents, it's very difficult for you to maintain that the Interahamwe was, in fact, independent of the MRND.  
A.	It is understandable.  These are young persons of the MRND.  The secretary general is entitled to speak to them and give an opinion.  But that will not mean that these people were under -- under his authority.  You, for example, can talk to me -- advise me on what I should do without we -- knowing each other necessarily.  
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  
MS. WILSON:
Mr. President, Your Honours, I'd like to point out that I maintained -- I stayed within the time.  It is -- it was only half an hour, and previously, yesterday, it was 40 minutes.  So approximately, it was 
one hour for both witnesses.  So I've completed my cross-examination of this witness, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry you said that.  We thought that the time to call the last witness was 55 minutes, which meant that you would only have had five minutes left. 
MS. WILSON:
Mr. President, when I looked at the time, it wasn't that.  It started a bit later.  So I've just -- that's the -- that's my questioning for this witness. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Weyl, any redirect? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I'm sorry.  Exceptionally, I have two questions of clarification to put to the witness.
RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Iyakaremye, counsel for the Prosecution placed a document before you -- a charge brought against you in Kinyarwanda.  And you told the Chamber that this document was brought to your knowledge when you were heard in this Tribunal in 2009.  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	Is there a date on this document?  Is it dated from what you are able to see? 
A.	No date.  It doesn't bear any date.  And, further, is that it does not indicate where the alleged crimes were perpetrated, and that is what makes me feel that the authenticity of the document is doubtful.  And the fact is that when people hear that such a -- such a person is coming to testify before the Tribunal, they fabricate these -- fabricate the evidence against him.  

But, Mr. President, this does not prevent me from coming to testify before the Tribunal.  This document has no other objective than to intimidate the witness so that eventually they decide not to come and testify.  

The important thing is to tell the truth and -- so that in the end, history will tell the entire -- the whole truth.  This kind of document cannot prevent me from coming to testify, particularly in regard to Mathieu, who was very known in the country.  And, for me, he was a hero and a hero for the country. 
MS. WILSON:
If I may interject.  I'm sorry.  My learned friend, if you look at the transcript, it does refer, in fact, to a date, the 23rd of November 2006.  
MR. WEYL:
Maybe counsel for the Prosecution can assist us because I do not see any date on this document.  

Maybe we can sort that out later on.  But I just want the witness to tell the Court when he testified -- to tell us when was it that he first testified before the ICTR.  
THE WITNESS:
I have no clear recollection of the date.  But it was in the Bizimungu case -- General Bizimungu.  
Maybe you can go back to the transcripts, but I have no recollection of the date.  

BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	When you first appeared before the Tribunal -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, was that the case for which there was a protection order?  One has to be careful not -- not to break that -- his protection in that case.  

Was that the case in which a protection order was made on your behalf?  Did you testify as a 
protected witness in the Bizimungu trial? 
THE WITNESS:
Nibyo...(microphones overlapping)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
THE WITNESS:
That is the case.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I stood by the -- my reading of the rules of procedure, which provides that the revocation of the protective order applies in a general manner, that when the protective orders are lifted, then it applies to the previous ones.  But if the Court has some apprehensions in that regard, we can redact them.  But that is not the principle issue I'm pursuing here.  I just want to know if the witness -- if they brought to -- to the notice of the witness the charges they showed him when he appeared the 
second time.  
THE WITNESS:
To answer your question, it was on the second occasion where I appeared as a witness that these charges were shown to me.  I don't know if the crimes they were referring to were committed after I left the Tribunal the first time.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, I will be happy if you can look at this document carefully and tell us if there's any date on it.  You may be able to tell us.  Maybe you have better eyes than we have, or maybe 
counsel for the Prosecution has better eyes than we have.  
A.	I think the document has been withdrawn.  But I recall that, during my testimony in the Setako case, this date -- the date was not found.  The names of those bringing the accusation was not indicated.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, this can be dealt with in argument.  The document is already admitted in evidence, so we can deal with this in argument.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I have no further questions for the witness.  I only wish to thank him for assisting the Court in its quest for the truth.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, this concludes your testimony before the Tribunal in this case.  So you're now excused and you're free to go.  We thank you, as we do all witnesses, for assisting us in our work.  

Yes.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I just want to make a request to be able to greet that old gentleman.  
I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  The registrar will make arrangements to facilitate your request.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
	(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, this went on a little bit longer than we had anticipated.  We're thinking that maybe we could resume at 3 o'clock.  About how long do you anticipate your submissions will take?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Around 20 minutes.  It shouldn't be very long.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, we are thinking about taking the adjournment now until three, and that should be -- we're -- we're closing the session now, and we will just have a status conference at three this afternoon.  Will that be convenient for you -- for your team? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, we will be at the disposal of the Chamber, and we thank you for these arrangements.  
At -- at 2:55 we'll be in the courtroom.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We won't put a monitor in place.  

Well, this brings to an end our trial session.  And, as usual, we'd just like to express our appreciation to everyone who has made it function as effectively as it has.  So we close our trial session now.  I think our next trial session will commence on the 10th of January.  So I also take this opportunity to wish everybody a happy holiday season over the Christmas season and over the New Year.  All the best.  
(Court adjourned at 1331H)
