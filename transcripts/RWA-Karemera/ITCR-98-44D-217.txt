MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.  The proceedings are resumed.

Could we have the appearances.  Are they as before, Prosecution?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  The appearance for the Prosecutor is as before. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Counsel for the Defence.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Madam President, the Defence team is the same as it was yesterday. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Before we adjourned yesterday, Counsel for the Defence was cross-examining the witness.  And I would like to remind the Defence counsel that he gave us an estimate, and as much as possible, we should try to live within it.  You may start your further cross-examination.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Very well.  Before I ask my first question, I return to a question which I had wanted to ask yesterday but for which I didn't have a response.  I would like to ask the Chamber leave for me to put that question to the witness.

Yesterday I had asked her -- and this is at page 24 of the draft transcripts.  I had asked her about

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, this is an open session.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Very well.  It would be necessary for us to move into a closed session, Madam President, by your leave. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, could we move into closed session.

MADAM PRESIDENT:

1215H 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we would like to give you some information regarding the conduct of proceedings in this Tribunal.  The lawyers from the Prosecution who are on your right side will lead you into your evidence.  After they have finished with their questions, the Defence lawyers who are on your left side -- and there are three of them on your left side -- will also ask you questions.  The Judges may also ask you some questions should they feel that they need clarifications.  

In order to facilitate your testimony so that it can be short and brief, we urge you to listen carefully to the questions and answer them briefly.  And where you have not understood the question, you can ask for clarification to be made and your brief and honest answers will assist us in establishing the truth in this case.  So those are the brief matters we wanted to bring to your attention before we proceed.  
Thank you.

Prosecution.
MR. NG'ARUA:
Madam President, Your Honours, I have submitted a personal identification sheet to the registry.  May I request Your Honours to lead the witness through the identification sheet.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we forgot to mention that when you finish speaking, kindly switch off your microphone to enable other speakers to be heard through the system.  

Do you speak English, Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
No. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could a member from the Kinyarwanda booth come around and read the information sheet to the witness.  
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
The witness is confirming that the data on this piece of paper is correct.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Madam President, Your Honours, may that document be marked as Prosecution Exhibit P. 2.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objection from the Defence?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
No, Madam President.  

MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  Let the document containing the personal identification information for Witness CNBU be admitted as an exhibit for the Prosecution and marked as exhibit -- is it P. 2, Registry?  
MR. DIALLO:
Yes, My Lord, P. 2.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
And may it also be placed under seal, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, and placed under seal because it contains the personal identifying information of the witness.
 (Exhibit No. P. 2 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you want us to start in open or closed session?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Open session, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we are in open session.  Be careful not to mention the names of people and places that may identify you.  Witness, can you hear us?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can hear you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right, Prosecution, you may proceed.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
May I request registry to distribute a list of names that may be mentioned for the purposes of assisting in the spellings.  

Please also give it to the stenographers.  
WITNESS CNBU, 
first having been duly sworn, 
testified as follows:

Q.	And what was his influence to the ordinary people, the businessmen and the community?

A.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under separate cover)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we are wondering to ourselves whether we are in the right forum.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
As the Court pleases.  First, I didn't want to interrupt him immediately because I know there is about ten-minute delay in the relay of information.  But may I request right away now that we have paused that the name mentioned -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Maybe we should go into closed session first.  

MR. NG'ARUA:
As the Court pleases.  I think it might be easier.  But may the name mentioned by the witness be placed under seal.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry.
