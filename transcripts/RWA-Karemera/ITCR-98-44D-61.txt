Exhibit No. P. 1D	12




























P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT: 
   Good morning, everybody.  Mr. Registry, could you open the proceedings? 
MR FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, Presiding, Judge Short and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Friday, 
the 23rd of September 2005, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the
Prosecutor v. Karemera et al, Case Number ICTR 98-44-T.

Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  And the appearances are the same.  Yes.  

Mr. Witness, can you hear me?  What is your condition this morning?  
THE WITNESS:
I don't feel very well, but I will try so that we can move forward.
MR. PRESIDENT:   
Thank you, very much.  Well, we will move forward, and I must remind you that you are under the same oath that you took at the commencement of your testimony to tell the truth.  The Prosecutor will continue his examination at this time. 
MR. WEBSTER:
     	Your Honour, there is the matter that I wanted to address before I continue with the witness.  It 	pertains to an issue that arose yesterday, and it's the notice issue in relation to the speech of 	Sindikubwabo that I wanted to introduce into evidence.  You will recall that yesterday Mr. Robinson 	made an objection and he stated that there was inadequate notice that this witness would address   	this issue.  

	Last night, I had an opportunity to go over the Rule 66 disclosures in this case.  And I noticed that with 	the Rule 67(D) notice which was filed on the 9th of August 2004, if we look at the last page of that 	document, there is a paragraph 9 and a bullet point.  And I would like to direct the Court's attention 	and the attention of the parties to paragraph 9, the last bullet point on page 4.  This is the document 	that I handed up to the Presiding Judge yesterday, I gave you an additional copy that I had with me 	but this is something that the Defence has had since the 9th of August 2004.  I can read it into the 	record if that is necessary, but I 	think everyone has it.  And if you compare that 9th paragraph, the 	fourth bullet point to the last page in the will-say that was served on the 16th of September, I believe 	the Court would notice that the will-say is simply an elaboration of a point that was made over a year 	ago in relation to this witness's anticipated testimony.  

	If it's helpful, I can show you my copy but this is the last copy that I have.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, it could be helpful.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'll need to get this back, but if you could direct the Court to right there. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
	Mr. Robinson was on his feet earlier.  I didn't know if he was. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes. Mr. President, may I reply to this application? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	yes. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
	Yes, Mr. President, it is correct that this witness did say in his will-say statement that there was a meeting in Butare where the government made incendiary remarks to draw hatred of the Tutsi, and Kambanda shot his gun in the air mass graves were organised and the government could have stopped the genocide, but did not do so.  I don't think that is sufficient notice that they would be introducing -- speaking about the speech of President Sindikubwabo on the 19th of April.  In addition to him speaking on that day there were many people other that spoke that day.  The incident of Kambanda, it's my belief he never shot his gun in the air at any meeting, but there was a different meeting in which he is alleged to have had a weapon with him and displayed it.  

	So our position is that we were not put on adequate notice from this paragraph that the speech of President Sindikubwabo would be included in the witness's examination.  Nevertheless, I recall that yesterday, the outcome of your deliberations on this issue was that you told Mr. Webster that you weren't going to preclude him from going forward with that, that it was up to him and he chose not to do it.  And I suppose if he changes his mind, unless you are going to change your ruling, he is free to do that.  I would point out that from the intervention he made with respect to Ruhengeri yesterday, we are going to need additional time to prepare to now bring forward information about the Ruhengeri meeting including a video tape that we are going to want to play and transcripts of that,                          President Habyarimana's speech.  If Mr. Webster insists that he wants to go into Sindikubwabo's speech with this witness, likewise, we will need additional time to prepare the actual materials that will be necessary for cross-examination on that point, as well as any other points within this paragraph of the will-say statement that he wants to bring up.  

	So I would again urge you to preclude him from use from introducing this testimony through the witness because of lack of inadequate notice, but if you maintain the ruling of yesterday, and leave it up to him, then we will have to have additional time, and the cross-examination would be extended.  And so I just want to put everyone on notice of that.  

Thank you.   
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.

Yes, Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Does the Court have a ruling on this matter? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We consider that ruling that we made yesterday still stands. 
WITNESS NAPOLEON AHMED MBONYUNKIZA 
                  EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I am going to ask you a few additional questions.  Good morning to you. 
A.	Good morning, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, during the period after the 6th of April, do you recall any significant speeches that were made over the radio by members of the interim government? 
A.	Yes, I remember some speeches.
Q.	Is there anyone in particular that you consider particularly significant? 
A.	The speeches that were made during that period were significant especially that made by Kambanda and the one given by Sindikubwabo.  Kambanda gave two speeches, Sindikubwabo gave one.  In fact, there are three different speeches given by two different people. 
Q.	Would you have any recollection of the period when this -- when you heard these speeches videos?  Can you think of a day or on a week, or is it possible for you to situate it in time for us?
A.	I heard first a communique that was published on the 9th of April 1994 - - rather broadcast on that date.   That communique dealt with the setting up of the Abatabazi government; in other words, the interim government.  

The other speech was given in Butare by Kambanda.  There was another speech given by Sindikubwabo during that same period.  I don't remember the specific date or the month when that speech was given, there is - - some time as passed since.
Q.	Mr.  Witness, when you used the word, "Abatabazi", can you explain that to the Court, please? 
A.	In every day Kinyarwanda, Abatabazi comes from the verb "Kutabara", which means to rescue, assist.  Abatabazi, therefore, means a group of persons who come to the aid of a given group of people.  That is what Abatabazi means. 
Q.	When was the first time that you heard that word in relation to the interim government? 
A.	That was on the 9th of April 1994. 
Q.	Is this a word that the government self-adopted, or did - - was this a journalist that made critical commentary and used the word?  To the extent that you know how was the word used? 
A.	As I said before, the journalists did not invent the term.  They simply reported what happened during the meeting that was called by Bagosora on the evening of the 8th to 9th of April.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse in fact, participated in that meeting.  The journalists, therefore, were not the ones who used the term for the first time.  It was the government itself which used the term.  The journalists only repeated the term when reporting on the different subjects that were debated during the said meeting.
Q.	How often did you hear references to the interim government as the Abatabazi government?  Was it something that was made frequent -- was the word used frequently or not or give us some idea of how current that word was during that period? 
A.	I am not able to count the number of times that the term Abatabazi was used because even when one wanted to refer to a minister or a member of the government, one would use the same term.  It was a term which was used by the various radio stations; even the well-known RTLM, was which an incendiary radio station.  It used the term Abatabazi in order to refer to the government.  So this word was used many times and I am unable to tell you how many times it was used because that was the term that was often used to refer to the interim government. 
Q.	Now, when you describe RTLM as an incendiary station, can you tell us what you mean by that? 
MR. ROBINSON:   
Objection, Mr. President, beyond the scope of any disclosures. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I am asking the witness to explain his own response to my previous question.  I am sure if I go through the ten different statements that were disclosed under Rule 66, I will find references to RTLM in them.  I am looking at the last document that I handed up to the Court - - 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The question is allowed.   
BY MR. WEBSTER:  
Q.	So you may answer, Mr. Witness.  Tell us what you mean by incendiary? 
A.	RTLM radio was referred to as being incendiary because when you say "Gutotwikira" means to set on fire and one can describe as incendiary or inflammatory any discourse that brings about hatred.  And the RTLM radio was created in order to support the killers, in other words, the Hutu who were the majority.  You will excuse me because normally I am not someone who goes into matters of ethnic division, but I am referring to the language that was used during that period of time.  And Radio RTLM was founded in order to support Hutu and to incite them to go and decimate the other Rwandans; and Radio RTLM is therefore, referred to as being incendiary because it was a radio station which was as if it were at the origin of a bush fire, to give you an imaginary.  It's not something that I am inventing?  It's what happened.  So that is how I can explain to you the term "incendiary ".  And Radio RTLM did, indeed, act as one such radio station. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, I would like us to focus on the speech that you said you heard that was made by President Sindikubwabo. Just think about that speech that is the only one that I am going to ask you questions about for right now.  What was significant about that speech to you?  If you can tell us what struck you about what President Sindikubwabo was saying? 
A.	Amongst the points that I recall, I remember that President Sindikubwabo when speaking about people from Butare, his own native area, he described the inhabitants of Butare préfecture as people who didn't feel concerned.  They were indifferent to the events and they didn't want to work with the others. And these people who were referred to as being indifferent must therefore be set aside.  

	He continued by speaking about the programme of the interim government and he told the people that they needed to understand what he was saying and here I am trying to summarise the content of his speech.  He said that the times were difficult and that it was, therefore, necessary that the people be able to interpret the words that he was using, and not to take them literally. On a specific point, he wanted to refer at the term Abatabazi.  He was then asking the inhabitants to try and analyse the words that he was using, especially that of Abatabazi. 

	In fact the Abatabazi were not people who had come to help the Tutsis who were victims of killings during this period of time.  It was rather a term that he was using in order to try and hide the reality.  It was, in fact, a kind of diversion that had been established for him.  The Abatabazi should rather come to the assistance of the Hutu.  Therefore the Hutus should unite in order to exterminate the Tutsis because if the Abatabazi had as an objective to help the Tutsis who were victims, party leaders and other personality who attended the meeting during which the government was established and here let me say that Mathieu Ngirumpatse who was national secretary of the MRND was present.  Anyone who was aware of the prevailing situation needed to denounce the killings that were taking place.  

	So, it was quite clear that the killings that were taking place were part of a pre-established plan within the framework of the Interahamwe organisation.  And it is in this framework that the youth were being incorporated in the civil defence programme.  It was a government which was qualified as a government of killers by the foreign opinion - - foreign public opinion, even international public opinion.  It was a government of the Abatabazi.  And anyone who was seeing what was happening, anyone who was against the killings would realise that the term about "Abatabazi" was not being used in its true meaning.  
	During that speech, all party leaders and personalities of rank were present, but no one rose up to denounce this plan, no one dared to disassociate himself from the speaker.  This incendiary speech was made in Butare itself despite the presence of Hutus who initially did not want to join fronts with the killers.  This speech ended up inciting the whole préfecture.  

	I think at that time in point, Sindikubwabo himself was a member of the MRND party and he had been president of the parliament before he was appointed president of the republic.  In his speech, he was using terms which clearly incited to the extermination of the Tutsi in Butare.  No member of government, none of the political official at party level had the courage to disassociate himself or herself from him Mathieu Ngirumpatse himself, who claimed that the MRND was uniting party, did not take the responsibility of denouncing that speech and Eduard Karemera himself who as vice president of the MRND, never rose up to denounce the speech; rather, what they did was to applaud the president's speech.  And it was as if they were blessing the plan and this led to the extermination of the Tutsis and all opponents.  

	Even Hutus who did not share the MRND ideology, this is an event which affected me a great deal.  And yesterday when you asked me the question dealing with the events concerning myself, this reminded me of the death of my little brother who was killed because he was killed mistakenly because people believed he was me.  The Abatabazi and the speech which was made by the -- by Sindikubwabo himself, it wasn't a speech which was calling for help for the Tutsis.  It was rather an inciting speech for the extermination of the Tutsis.  He clearly said to the people that the people did not need to take the terms he was using literally.  They needed to make an in-depth analysis in order to come to the truth.  In other words, they needed to read between the lines, as it were. 

	The members of government were present.  And I believe that he said that some of the members were not present but they were hindered from being present.    He said that they were working on other business of government.  He continued to say that the government needed to go down to the field in order to meet the people.  He also said that members of government should not work only in their offices.  Yesterday we almost came to mention this but we didn't discuss the matter at length, but he dwelt on the fact that members of the government should go down to the field so that they can meet the people.  Sindikubwabo said that this was a special government in comparison to others and as compared to other governments, it was necessary for it to go down to the ground and meet the members of the population at grassroots.  I think if that - - I think that was the situation in regard to the speech made at the time.

0955H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, how did you come to personally hear this speech? 
A.	I had a radio set at home.  I didn't go to a neighbour's in order to listen to the radio.  I listened to this speech on the radio, and this was the radio set that I had at my house. 
Q.	Do you recall if this speech was played on the radio more than once? 
A.	You know, you can listen to a speech, and given its content, the seriousness of its content, you would not dwell on how many times you heard the speech.  What I know is on the day that he made the speech, the speech was broadcasted on radio.  I would be lying if I told you that I heard it two, three, four or five times.  

It was a period of intense political activity.  And this was the speech made by a president of the republic.  One could also listen to foreign radio stations.  And I know that there was also Radio Muhabura which was denouncing the killings.  I remember a journalist known as Esdras Biziraguteba who called upon Rwandan citizens to form a common front against the killings.  This was the message that was being put out by Radio Muhabura, which was the RPF radio, and the same message came out on the international radio stations.  That was the situation, Mr. Prosecutor.  

I am unable to tell you how many times this speech was broadcast on Radio Rwanda. 
Q.	Do you recall if this speech generated discussion in your community?  Did you discuss it with anyone else after hearing it? 
A.	Given the prevailing situation we didn't have time to discuss this speech.  Everyone was doing his or her best in order to save his or her life and that of his or her relatives, placing them in a shelter away from the killers.  The people who were responsible for implementing the plan in question, I don't know how to present to you the situation prevailing in my neighbourhood at the time.  We didn't have the will, nor the time to discuss the content of that speech. 
Q.	You mentioned a speech by Kambanda as well.  Is there anything in particular about Kambanda's speech that you would like -- that you would bring our attention to? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I have an objection on the same grounds.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you.  The objection is overruled. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, directing your attention to the speech you made reference to earlier, that was made by Jean Kambanda, can you tell us anything that was significant in Mr. Kambanda's speech that you remember? 
A.	As I have already explained, it was clear that the killings were organised even before 1994.  I'm saying this because the material to be used for the extermination of the Tutsi and the opponents of the MRND party had already been imported. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, just listen to my question again and direct your attention to the question, because all I'm asking you about now is the speech that Jean Kambanda made that you referred to earlier.  So, think back in your mind and tell us what you remember about that speech that struck you as significant in April of 1994.
A.	Former Prime Minister Kambanda, when he was in Butare, where they had gone, if I recall, he, first of all, went to the investiture of a bourgmestre somewhere.  I do not remember his itinerary very well, but what I know is that Kambanda himself took a firearm.  And he spoke to people by telling them that he had come to distribute material to them, so that they can be able to overcome the enemy; in other words, the Tutsi.  Furthermore, to be more specific, he took a pistol, which he was brandishing in the air at that moment; it was whilst he was speaking.  But I'm not sure whether anyone else shot in the air, or whether it was himself.  I'm not sure about that.  

But the fact is that he showed a pistol, saying that I myself also have my weapon.  And he started distributing weapons to those who had been trained for that purpose.  The incident happened at the time, and as I have explained, we knew that this was going on in -- even before the genocide because care had been taken to find the material which was going to be used in the genocide of 1994.  That was the situation, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Okay --  
A.	The events then followed in that way. 
Q.	But concerning this particular speech, the speech that you have been discussing most recently, did you hear Kambanda's words himself?  Was he the one that you heard over the radio, or was it a journalist that was describing this speech, to the extent that you can remember?  Give the Court a clear understanding of what you heard and how you understood the event. 
A.	Well, I personally heard that speech.  There was, indeed, a speech that he made when he realised that the war was taking another magnitude, and that was in relation with the Inkotanyi.  He was saying that the - well, the set-up of the Abatabazi government, but that the RPF didn't want to hear anything about negotiations with that government, because the RPF wanted the government to be dissolved before any negotiations; because at a given time he made a speech that could be called, or described, as pacifying.  Probably somebody has some archives; I am referring to the archives of Radio Rwanda.  But I personally heard those two speeches.  

At the time, he realised that the RPF was saving people that were in danger.  He said, "They are saying that I myself, Kambanda, was running away and that I was on my way out."  He said that he couldn't run away from the country, and that he wanted to go to Kigali to work with the people in a given ceremony, but I can't remember that ceremony.  What he meant was that he was not running away.  And in reality, he was running away because in proportion as the war went on, the RPF was saving or liberating certain regions of the country.  

In a nutshell, these were the two speeches of Kambanda that I can remember. 
Q.	Do you recall if Kambanda himself ever used the word "Abatabazi"? 
A.	Well, I can say that I do remember it, because it was the name of a government, the government at the time.  There was no other name.  We are talking then about that government, Abatabazi. 
Q.	Right.  Mr. Witness, I'm going to ask you a last series of questions on a completely different issue, and then we will complete your direct examination.  Yesterday, I asked you if you yourself had ever been prosecuted in relation to the events of 1994.  And I would like to ask you that question again now.  Can you explain to this Court how you yourself were either implicated or not in the events of 1994? 
A.	As I did say yesterday, and even before that, when that question was put to me, I was very emotional because of the negative consequences those events had on me.  Those events caused a lot of pain, traumaism (sic) of all sorts, deep wounds that all Rwandans suffered.  This is why yesterday I was rather emotional.  

I remember the death of my brother Paul Ndakize.  His body was torn into pieces.  And those are events that are very well-known.  I think you can ask Clementine, his wife, and his orphans that he left behind.  

Now, let us talk about what happened after the war.  In 1998, in June, I was arrested and detained; but people reacted positively.  People came to the court and demonstrated against that act.  People were saying, this fellow helped us during hard times.  And it was decided that I be freed and I was acquitted so far as that accusation of genocide was concerned.  This is what happened, just like many other Rwandans, be it those who were in the camps, be it those that were in other camps.  Every Rwandan suffered somewhere unjustly imprisoned.  And now we are all working to remedy the situation.  This is the picture as far as the post-genocide period is concerned, so far as I am concerned, too. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, was there a trial in regard to your arrest, or were you simply released?  Was there a trial on the merits in relation to your case?  
A.	No, I was not released just like that.  Of course, there was a trial.  At the first instance court in Kigali, that was that matter concerning 33 people.  Only five of them were released, and the others were sentenced to serve various terms.  Some were suspected of having been involved in the massacres, in the killings.  

And in my arrest, in a nutshell, there was a trial at the first instance tribunal, if my memory serves me right; this was a long time ago.  I do not remember the dates as far as the beginning of the trial was concerned, but I was in detention for around four years; that is, three years, nine months precisely.  These are some of the consequences of the genocide.  And I believe that we have to accept them.  We have no other choice.  And we should exercise patience and face them. 
Q.	What was the judgement of the court of first instance with respect to you, in particular? 
A.	As far as I was concerned, the decision arrived at -- well, I am talking about what happened.  Many allegations were made, training or being a member of an association of criminals.  I was told that I was acquitted in terms of participated in the genocide is concerned; acquitted so far as allegations concerning the extermination of Tutsi was concerned.  Or I -- and I was also acquitted so far as the allegation of being involved in a joint criminal enterprise was concerned.  

And the civil parties claimed damages, that it was said that I should not pay those damages.  I was also acquitted of the allegations of rape.  There was also another accusation of criminal participation in the killings; I was also acquitted on that charge.

Now, what I can say is that during the war, I went for help from somebody called Habyarimana Jean.  I realised that we were going to be killed.  And he put at at our disposal several Interahamwe to protect us.  There were people who came to hide in my house.  And in the evening, soldiers came to arrest those Interahamwe.  Their weapons were taken away.  

I asked him to find us soldiers to protect us, but he said he couldn't do so because the soldiers were all at the front.  As a solution, he gave me a firearm, only if it was an R26.  I firstly refused to accept that weapon, that firearm.  But then later, my friends, especially Mvuyekure (phonetic), who died later on, and Callixte Ngendayimana (phonetic) encouraged me, said, "Take the firearm", and I did.  And the soldier in question showed us how to use the weapon.  And at the end, I accepted the weapon, the firearm.  

And as I had a Hutu ID card and I had the weapon, nobody asked me how I got the weapon.  If I was not a Hutu, I would have had problems, because they would have asked me how I got the firearm.  So that I continued to protect the people with that firearm, up to the time that the RPF came to our area.  When the RPF soldiers came, I surrendered my weapon to them, and they commended me for the work that I did.  And then later on I was elected as an official of my area.  

But as I was a civilian, and that I had been seen carrying a firearm, the tribunal, the court decided that I should be jailed for one year for possessing a weapon as well.  But since I had already spent four years in jail, they deemed that I had served my term; and I was released.  That was my situation after the genocide.  

I don't know that I should add any other thing, especially things like the events, or the elements that made me so emotional yesterday.  I'm very sorry.  Give me just one moment, let me add that element, I beg of you, just one, one minute.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm going to ask you one or two questions, and then we will complete your testimony, and then you can address that issue at that time.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Could we have -- yesterday, we addressed an exhibit that we had not completed the process of having it admitted.  May I ask the assistant for the registrar to place an item, I believe it is four pages, before the witness.  I will read out the K numbers.  I believe we have already identified them.  K0356034 would be the first page.  K0356035 would be the second page.  K0356037 would be the third.  K0356038 would be the fourth page.  All of this would be one document.  

Would you kindly present the first page of that document -- perhaps can you show it to the Court and to the Defence counsel and then place it before the witness, please. 

Mr. Issa, if you could show the witness just the first page, K0356034. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you recognise what has been placed before you? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Have you ever seen something resembling that image before? 
A.	Even if this is a photocopy, I can see that it is rather hazy, but somewhere in the corner there was the MRND flag.  I believe this is an MRND membership card.  It is not an Interahamwe membership card.  This is an MRND membership card.  A distinction should be made between the two membership cards. 
Q.	Did you yourself ever have an MRND membership card? 
A.	Yes, for sure.  Before I resigned I had a similar card that is an MRND membership card. 
Q.	Did the card that you yourself possessed differ in any respect from the one -- from the image that you are looking at before you now, in terms of its configuration? 
A.	There is no difference.  I don't know whether, as my poor eyesight, but I believe that this stamp is put upside down.  I hope my sight is not misleading me. 
MR. WEBSTER:
If I could have the registrar's assistant place the image of 6037 before the witness. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you describe what has been placed in front of you now? 
A.	Now, this is a membership card for MRND members.  Now, this is after the advent of multipartyism, that is, after MRND accepted to recognise all of the parties in the country.  And I did say that this is the back of the MRND membership card, but I know that the front usually had some additional indications.  What is important, though, is what you have is the front, not the back of the membership card. 
Q.	And what is it that leads you to conclude that this was a card from after the period of multipartyism? 
A.	I'm saying, so because you can even see the nature of the stamp.  Let me correct myself.  Let me correct myself; this is a card, a membership card for MRND members.  When MRND was the single party -- I was rather confused here.  It was when we had the single-party state, the one-party state.  This is the card I myself had, this type of card.  And you will see that there is an insignia, and at speed (sic). This is the insignia of the MRND.  And it is for the Republican Movement for Democracy and Development, that means this is the front of the card, the membership card.  
The back of the card is not very legible.  I see "Musango Gitarama", but it is not quite legible.  At any rate, this document shows the front of the -- the front part of the membership card for MRND members. 
Q.	Okay.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, at this time I would like to move those four pages into evidence as P. 1D. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That was major exercise.  Admitted into evidence.
(Exhibit No. P. 1D admitted)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, has your testimony over the last four days been truthful? 
A.	Personally, I have no intention to falsely accuse anyone.  That is the first thing I should say.  I know what it feels like to be in prison and to be falsely accused.  I know how troubling that can be to someone.  Consequently, I would like to thank those who gave me an opportunity to take a solemn declaration.  I know what I am doing, and what I have done in my village.  And I always tell people to tell the truth, even during the gacaca trials.  So, I am telling the truth.  I have no intention of falsely accusing anyone.  I know that the good Lord would reproach me for that.  In no way shape or form can I falsely accuse someone.  I think that I've displayed that attitude.  I have even offered them an opportunity to look at my documents.  I am not hiding any portion of the truth.

But there is one thing that I have forgotten to mention with regard to the third meeting that we spoke about, previously.  I forgot to tell you that during that third meeting there were some people who decided to resign.  And they stopped coming to the meetings.  Rusirari Jacques is but one example;  Désiré Murenzi is another, Nyakagabo is another, he was a conseiller in the Gatata (phonetic)  secteur.  Those people resigned from the MRND party and they disassociated themselves -- distanced, rather, themselves from the programme laid out by the killers.  

During the massacres, other events occurred in Byumba.  Some people were wounded, especially a personal called Paulin, who was hurt in a grenade attack.  He went to Nairobi for treatment, and he still has problems associated with that attack.  These are some of the things that I forgot to mention during my testimony.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Is this part of your case?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm just going to ask one clarifying question, and that will be it, Your Honour. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	When you were talking about the third meeting, could you be more specific, please?  You gave us some additional information.  When you said the third meeting, can you remind us of the month and the year that you are talking about? 
A.	I was talking about the meeting of February 1992, which was chaired by Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  At that time the Interahamwe were being created, and the killings were being prepared. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  We will have another opportunity to speak to each other.  I can ask you questions again after the Defence has completed their cross-examination.  But now your direct examination has come to an end, I will sit down, and you will direct your attention as the Court explains to you.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
During the early part of the testimony of this witness one or two matters had arisen, which had prompted me to indicate that we would have granted four hours between the completion of the examination-in-chief and the commencement of the cross-examination.  

Now, a lot of time has passed since then, because at that time I was under the impression that the examination-in-chief would have been completed on Tuesday, Tuesday afternoon.  So, there has been a lot of time since then.  Could I enquire whether you are ready to commence your cross-examination?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Chantal Hounkpatin, representing Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Thank you for reminding us that much has happened since Tuesday, many things have been said.  And I apologise for having to tell you that we are not in a position to cross-examine the witness; this is because of the testimony that we have just heard.  We are dealing with a factual witness, but I wouldn't dare say that it seems like an expert witness.  

What was planned, the plan completely derailed.  We took six hours.  We were planning to take six hours for the examination-in-chief.  We have tried to point out our difficulties on the Defence side, given the disclosure problems.  We have tried to explain our difficulty in getting organised.  And right now, cross-examination, if we had to begin it immediately, under such conditions, it would be unfair for the Defence.  As such, Mr. President, I would request that we delay the commencement of the cross-examination so that we are in a better position to conduct that.  Thank you.

One last issue that I forgot to raise; there was also an issue with regard to the judgement that had to be translated and tendered.  Some excerpts of that were translated.  We did not have the time to look at that document.  Even if we had one afternoon to do so, that was when the witness was not available.  But when we adjourned, at that point in time, it was too late for us to go to UNDF and discuss the matter with our clients.  So, unfortunately, we were not able to use that time to move forward in an efficient manner.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, I take it that it is anticipated that you will be the opening cross-examiner of this witness?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Of course, Mr. President.  Given the testimony and what the witness said, logically I should be the first to cross-examine the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would you be -- if we took the adjournment now, this is Friday; would you be ready to start at quarter to 9 on Monday morning?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
It seems tight, Mr. President.  If we were to adjourn now, we would not have an opportunity to go to the detention facilities to see our clients. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can make arrangements --  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
We can do that on Saturday. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we can assist in getting access to see your clients today.  If that would assist you, we can make an order for the registrar to do what is necessary to assist you to have access to your clients today. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you for that proposal, Mr. President.  I would also request that I be given an opportunity to tell you how I work, Mr. President.  I myself, this afternoon, would like to deal with all of the statements that we have heard for practically four days.  Those completely fell out of the framework that was planned.  I would like to deal with those today and be able to meet my client tomorrow.  This is my own way of working.  I don't know if my learned colleagues work in the same manner.  I would have preferred this afternoon to take time to deal with all of the information and digest all of the information that I have heard from this witness.

Of course, I'm not refusing your proposal, Mr. President.  I'm simply informing you of my own way of working, the way my team and I work.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It was not my intention to direct any particular method of work, but in regard to the comment you made, I was just offering the assistance of the Chamber to facilitate consultation.  Certainly you are free to choose your own working method and your own work timetable.  My only interest, really, is scheduling the commencement of the cross-examination.  And we had thought that it was reasonable not to commence the cross-examination today.  But if you had the entire weekend for preparation, we thought that Monday morning would be a convenient time to start.  So, that is really what -- the major issue for us, and also just to see if there was anything that was necessary that we could have provided some assistance with. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  As we are trying to find a convenient solution for all of the parties, I would prefer to begin Tuesday, since we have completely fell off of the track with regard to this witness's testimony.  Much new information was put forth, and we need to deal with that as completely as possible.  If you grant me leave to begin Tuesday morning, I would be most obliged and be ready to begin the cross-examination then. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, we would normally expect that cross-examination commences immediately after the examination-in-chief is completed.  That is what we intend to enforce during the trial.  Now, this is a first witness.  And we appreciate that there were particular problems which developed during the testimony.  We accept that.  That is why we thought some time was required for you to be in a proper position for cross-examination.  

Having said that, the content of the witness's testimony should not have taken you by surprise, the actual content of it.  It would have been consistent with what you would have prepared.  And I appreciate that there are one or two additional areas that you could not be expected to be ready for immediately, but your request of starting on Tuesday seems rather excessive in the circumstances.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I don't wish to seem excessive.  I simply wanted to point out our availability.  This is not your problem, Mr. President, but I would point out that this is a case that I have taken up along the way.  And for me, the fact that issues, unanticipated issues, came up during the testimony lead me to ask for that additional day.  

We were prepared to hear another witness, not this witness here before us.  Had we heard that witness, if the order of witnesses that was proposed was respected, we could have avoided all of these issues that we are now dealing with, Mr. President, this morning.

1050H
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have considered your request, Ms. Hounkpatin.  We think that we are not satisfied that the circumstances require a full day on Monday.  But what we would do is resume late on Monday morning, we'd start at 11 o'clock on morning Monday, and we expect that you'd be ready to cross-examine at that time.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
If that is the last resort and that is the date and time that you decide, there is nothing I can say further about that.  Unless my colleagues have anything to add, thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I should ask, though, did you -- would you require our assistance for access of any time over the weekend, or would you be able to manage using the routine arrangements?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I have planned and made the necessary arrangements to go to UNDF Saturday.  And I counted on going back on Monday morning, if I had that day.  But I had made the necessary application to meet my client on Saturday morning, as during trial we are not permitted to go -- we are not in a position to go to UNDF during the week during trial.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  I'm going to be cross-examining last, I'm not sure when that would commence, whether it would be next week or the week after,  but I'm going to need some assistance from the Trial Chamber, so I'll bring this up to you now.  We discussed the Kinyarwandan judgement, and you instructed us to identify the pages that would need translation.  And during the day that we had a recess early, I had my assistant do that, and we have identified 14 pages, which need to be translated from Kinyarwanda it into English.  And what I've had him do is highlight in purple the statements that were made by others about this witness, and in green, the statements, and now I would like to have these translated.  And I was advised by your coordinator that the -- that that should be done by the language section as opposed to oral translation.  And so I'm now requesting that the Trial Chamber direct the language section to provide written translation of the items that have been highlighted in the document.  And I'd be in a position to commence my cross-examination after that's been completed.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.  We have been treating those issues as administrative issues, so the trial coordinator will be liaising with the department to procure the attainment of that object.  So I would not actually be making a court order, as it were.  

Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President, thank you.  You indicated that these were administrative matters, but, ifsofar as Mr. Robinson, my colleague, has said that he has asked for translation of some pages from Kinyarwanda into English, may I also use this opportunity to request that it also be translated into French, because that would already be clearing our path.  I'm requesting that the 14 pages identified by my colleague, Mr. Robinson, be translated into French that would be a good thing, indeed, Mr. President, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, I take it -- I take it from that that there are no additional material which your team requires translated, it's just the document -- just the pages Mr. Robinson has identified, and that would satisfy your requirements.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, let me clarify that.  For the time being, I am going to take refuge behind the pugnacious nature of Mr. Robinson because he has done the identification, and I'm going to be taking what we have, but it is quite likely that during the weekend, Mr. Ngirumpatse will identify other pages for translation.  But I would, as of now, wish to benefit from the work that Mr. Robinson has been able to do and we, ourselves, had been unable to do because we have been unable to discuss with Mr. Ngirumpatse, our client.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness -- sorry, are there any other issues that need to be addressed?  

Well, we are going to take the adjournment until Monday morning -- until morning Monday at 11 o'clock.  Your examination by the Prosecutor is completed, but you have to return to court to be cross-examined by the lawyers for the Accused person in this trial, so you are still a witness before our Tribunal.  

As I told you on more than one occasion, during this adjournment, as on any other adjournment of the proceedings while you are giving your testimony, you remain a witness before our Tribunal, and you are not to discuss this matter with anybody.  Do you understand me?  
THE WITNESS:  
Yes, I have understood, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take the adjournment until 11 o'clock on Monday morning.  
(Court adjourned at 1104H)
