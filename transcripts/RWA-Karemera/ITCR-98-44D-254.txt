JACQUES-ROGER BOOH-BOOH,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Good morning to you, Mr. Booh-Booh.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	Before we move on, I'd like to go back to something we addressed yesterday, which I don't think was very clear on the record.  If you bear with me, we'll return to the question that you've already answered, just for the clarity of the trial record.  

Yesterday, I asked you about your meeting with Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Joseph Nzirorera on the 12th of January, and this would be the very same day that you met with President Habyarimana. 
You told us that you met with them at the Amahoro headquarters, and, as reflected in the memorandum that you then sent to Kofi Annan, that meeting took place at around 4 p.m.  What I was trying to get from you is whether you were aware of a second between Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Joseph Nzirorera that would have involved General Dallaire on the following day, the 13th of January.  

And I'm suggesting to you that there's a second meeting, because Frank Claeys, who was a 
Belgian officer with UNAMIR, recounts meeting or being present at a meeting between Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera and Dallaire on the very next day after having gone with Jean-Pierre to actually inspect weapons that were at the MRND headquarters.  

So, according to his testimony, he was present for a meeting on the 13th January where, apparently, you were not present.  And according to your testimony, you participated in a meeting on the 12th of January where Claeys may not have been present.  So that's the issue.  And if you know anything about a second meeting, you can tell us.  
A.	Firstly, I personally don't know who Mr. Claeys is.  If you could tell me who he is, vis-à-vis, General Dallaire, I may understand better.  I am aware that General Dallaire was often accompanied by a soldier whom I would consider as being his bodyguard, but as to what his name was exactly, I -- I can't identify him as such.  Further, allow me to say that meeting of the 13th is something I have no recollection of.  
Q.	Okay, thank you very much.  The record is clear now.  So let's move on a bit, Mr. Booh-Booh, and I'd like to talk to you about the events of the 6th of April.  I believe you told us in your direct examination that you were informed about the crash of the presidential plane by Enoch Ruhigira who called you sometime during the evening of the 6th of April, and that sometime shortly after midnight, General Dallaire arrived at your residence with Colonel Bagosora and another military officer.  

Now, you seemed a bit perturbed and indignant towards Dallaire that evening because he had not called you prior to setting up this meeting sometime after midnight.  Did you, yourself, try to call General Dallaire that evening after you heard the news about the crash of the plane? 
A.	I tried to get hold of General Dallaire.  Unfortunately, he was not reachable.  Allow me to say that in Kigali we had a rudimentary telephone communication infrastructure.  So we were using a Motorola telephone system which allowed everyone to hear everyone else on the network.  So everybody who was connected to the network was in a position to hear what was said on -- on it.  And that is the system which I used, and I was unable to reach General Dallaire.  

But it came to my attention that some soldiers -- UNAMIR -- some UNAMIR soldiers had gone to the airport and that they were facing difficulties, but I don't know with which forces.  But after the accident, the first Belgian soldiers, who went to the airport, were poorly received.  I believe that, still through that rudimentary telephone communication system, there was somebody who was saying that Belgian soldiers who had wanted to reach the place where the plane had crashed faced difficulties in getting there.  
Q.	Right.  Thank you for your response, Mr. Booh-Booh, because you've actually come directly to the issue that I was going to raise with you.  Because when you testified in your direct examination, I think we were left with the impression that Dallaire had not been in touch with you and because he had not been in touch with you, you didn't know what was going on.  

But we all know that the UN Motorola walkie-talkie, not a telephone, a walkie-talkie, was standard issue and you, as the head of mission, would've had access to all of its frequencies which presumably would allow you to follow everything that is being said -- all of the information that is being shared among the UNAMIR personnel, which is exactly what you've just told us.  That's the case, isn't it? 
A.	It is.  
Q.	So even though Dallaire did not call you by telephone and speak to you one-on-one directly, certainly you would agree with me that you could follow everything that was going on, including any communication that Dallaire would've had on the Motorola walkie-talkie system.  
A.	Yes, indeed.  But I didn't hear him talk.  
Q.	Now, when Dallaire and Bagosora arrived at your residence, I believe you told us initially you didn't even want to receive them.  Is that accurate?  I think -- excuse me for backtracking a bit, but what I recall you saying on direct examination is that you were convinced by your aides to receive them because you were a bit irritated with him not having contacted you directly.  Do you want to clarify that? 
A.	Yes.  Indeed, I wished, prior to receiving anyone, that my military advisor, that is, General Dallaire, should consult with me to brief me on the situation on the field, as he was in charge of the UNAMIR soldiers or forces.  There is a minimum level of collaboration required at UNAMIR.  I couldn't be placed before officers just like that.  People with whom conversation had been held the entire evening without briefing me as to what had been discussed, what the situation was -- that is the idea of formality.  And I was the head of the mission and they needed to respect the head of the mission to whom New York addressed itself directly.  

So I was awaiting that the force commander should transmit me -- to me even the minimum amount of information that he had to prepare us to meet the other parties, be they political parties, military forces and so on and so forth.  That was not done, and I was irritated by that.  And that is what I'm saying.  
I don't have to say that over and over.  

However, ultimately, I received the military delegation that had come to my residence, along with General Dallaire -- General Dallaire, and I would, therefore, like to confirm that it's in subsequent discussions with my collaborators who were working with me that evening that I agreed.  
Q.	All right.  When they arrived and after you had made the necessary civil introductions, it would've become apparent to you that Bagosora and Dallaire had competing priorities -- or, competing agendas in speaking to you, or placing you in the middle of the crisis they were trying to resolve.  Isn't that so? 

Dallaire had explained to you that he told Bagosora that the questions that needed to be answered could only come from you, and I would imagine that, during the course of your conversation with Bagosora and Dallaire, it would've become apparent that the two were turning to you to bridge an impasse.  And if that's so, you can explain your impression, and if not, I'll suggest my analysis of the situation to you and get your response.  
A.	That is not correct.  When I welcomed the military delegation and the force commander, there was no introduction made by General Dallaire.  He didn't tell me what had happened prior to his arrival to my residence and what issues were within the scope of my duties and -- which he had not dealt with, with the soldiers.  It is the head of the military soldiers' delegation who informed me about the crash, the meeting of the soldiers, as well as the officer they had designated to lead their -- their team.  

So I asked them if that was a military coup d'état.  And he answered me, "No, it wasn't," that all they desired was that there should be an authority that reassures the people and that -- and which allows UNAMIR and political parties to carry on with efforts to set up institutions and implement the 
Arusha agreements.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Booh-Booh, you explained to us during your direct examination that you had quite a lengthy diplomatic career before being appointed the special representative of the Secretary General.  Over 
two decades of diplomatic and international experience; right? 
A.	Right, indeed.  
Q.	What I'd like to suggest to you is that a man of your experience and a man with your familiarity with the political terrain of Rwanda could pick up, within a few minutes, exactly what was going on.  And your way of addressing it was to ask Bagosora if he was involved in a coup.  And you put the question that way because it was obvious to you that the military was trying to take over.  

And the experienced diplomat that you were gave you the presence of mind to ask a question instead of making an accusation.  Wasn't it obvious?  Bagosora came, talked to you about a military crisis committee and you put two and two together very quickly.  This was a coup in the making, and 
Dallaire came to you to help him stop it, and Bagosora appealed to you to allow it to go forward.  
Isn't that what the situation was? 
A.	That isn't an analysis at all.  And I object to certain types of insinuation.  You know, this is barely 
two hours after the death of a president and there's no one there with -- with a computer and who provides solutions to all problems.  

I'm telling you a few hours after of the death of the president we had to deal with issues in the heat of the matter.  And it has to do with common sense.  What is there to be done?  Considering the fact that we had agreed to meet each other, we -- we could've refused to meet each other, and the soldiers could've decided to carry on with what they wanted without seeking to meet UNAMIR.  But -- so long as we had decided -- agreed to meet -- I reject -- I object to your insinuations.  In other words, you are doubting my ability to assess the situation, and what do you know about that anyway? 
Q.	Well, I must apologise to you, Mr. Booh-Booh, if you are left with the impression that I was doubting your capacity.  In fact, I was complimenting your capacity because you sized up the situation instantly.  That's my appreciation of that particular moment in history, and I was, actually, being very complimentary to you.  So pardon me if you get the opposite impression.  

What I'm suggesting to you is that, when Bagosora told you that he had assembled a military crisis committee that was going to manage the crisis, your response within moments was to suggest to him indirectly that this seems to be a coup in the making.  And I'm suggesting to you that it was your long diplomatic experience and your sophistication that allowed you to recognise that moment for what it was.  So I'm not criticising you at all.  In fact, I'm suggesting that you were very perceptive.  

And having reviewed your testimony in the Bagosora trial and your various writings, I know how you've characterised the scenario.  You told Bagosora that UNAMIR would not allow soldiers to take command of the situation and that you were there to deal with civilian authorities.  Isn't that how you responded? 
A.	That is correct, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	And after you made that response, Dallaire joined in and supported you and said that the UNAMIR mission was to deal with civilian authorities and that only civilians could control or deal with the -- the political situation or the political crisis.  Isn't that also the case? 
A.	Yes, that was indeed the case, yes.  
Q.	And I'm sure it took no more than five minutes for you to cover that terrain to make it clear to Bagosora that you, meaning the head of the UNAMIR mission, would not endorse a military takeover.  Isn't that so? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	You even gently threatened him by saying that UNAMIR would simply pull out, and you could make that statement without even contacting New York because New York would make decisions based on your recommendation; isn't that so? 
A.	I did not say that during the meeting with the soldiers, but that was, indeed, my thought, namely, that the situation had to be dealt with on the spot and then to report subsequently to the Secretary General in New York.  
Q.	Well, I could take a few minutes and find it in your previous testimony before Trial Chamber I.  And I think you've said the same thing in your book, and I think you said the same thing to Professor Reyntjens, but it's really a minor point.  

But you implied -- my reading of your prior writing and testimony is that you gently implied to Bagosora that any military takeover would lead to an end of the UNAMIR mission.  I don't think you had to be too explicit or too threatening, but the mere insinuation of that delivered the message.  Wouldn't you agree? 
A.	In fact, I said so openly that we were not there to work with soldiers and that we would not, in any situation whatsoever, lend credence to their coup d'état -- if it was, indeed, a coup d'état.  
Q.	Well, that's exactly the point I was making, and perhaps I could've made it a little bit more elegantly.  

And to address that very issue with even more authority, you excused yourself, and you left Dallaire and Bagosora in the living room, and then went upstairs and called a number of ambassadors to apprise them of the situation and of the position that you were taking:  That you would, under no circumstances, abide a military coup.  Isn't that so? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	And you were on the phone talking to these various other diplomats for at least 15 to 20 minutes, because I'm sure you had to speak to the American ambassador, you had to speak to the French, you had to speak to the Belgians; I believe you also spoke to the apostolic nuncio.  But you made a number of phone calls all within a matter of minutes, being very skilled as a diplomat and looking for the backup that you would need in order to deliver a clear message to Bagosora.  Isn't that so? 
A.	That is correct, except for the fact that I did not call all the ambassadors.  I got the ambassador of the United States and of Belgium on the phone.  And they, in turn, contacted their colleagues and convinced them to adopt the UNAMIR position and also to meet -- to meet with us the next day.  
Q.	And my suggestion to you now is that the reason you suggested a meeting the following day was to create a situation where the same message you had just given Bagosora could be repeated with the support of the western diplomatic community.  That's why you were setting up the meeting the following morning, to prevent a military coup from going forward.  
A.	That is correct.  And to also provide additional advice to the soldiers in order to calm down the population and put an end to the violence that was raging in the city.  
Q.	You knew about violence raging in the city on the night of the 6th of April? 
A.	Yes.  Very early in the morning, the prime minister had provided me with the names of some ministers of her government who had been abducted in the morning.  I also contacted the apostolic nuncio who was expected to attend the meeting at the residence of the United States ambassador, who also --
Q.	I'm not trying to -- to stop you from giving us this information.  We'll get to it, but I'd like to still deal with the meeting you're having with Bagosora and Dallaire.  We'll come to what you're trying to tell us now in a few minutes.  

Now, sometime that evening, whether it was before you spoke to the other diplomats or after, didn't you make it clear to Bagosora that the authority -- the civilian authority that should manage the crisis was the government of Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana?  
A.	That is correct, I told him so.  
Q.	And what was his response? 
A.	His answer was an unequivocal refusal.  
Q.	So when he left your home that night, the agreement was for you to reconvene the following morning at the residence of the American ambassador along with other western diplomats, and your expectation was that, at that meeting, in the morning, all of you together would be able to convince Bagosora that the military could not take over, and that Madam Agathe Uwilingiyimana's government would manage the situation.  Isn't that so? 
A.	That is correct.  But, Mr. Prosecutor, let me clarify one little point.  Before our meeting ended, I also suggested to the soldiers to contact all political parties, particularly the MRND, which was the president's party and which, pursuant to the Arusha Peace Accords, had the duty or responsibility of designating or proposing the president of the republic or the person to hold that position, so I suggested that they do so.  And they -- unlike their reaction to my suggestion about the prime minister, they did not reject the proposal.  However, they did not give me a clear answer.  

Let me say also that I was in contact with the RPF.  They had called me throughout the entire evening, in much the same way as all the embassies, believing that I was more informed about what had just transpired; whereas, that was not the case.  I would also like to mention the information that was available to me and the initiative that I had taken -- I wanted to provide that information to the RPF as well.  

But they did not call me till the next morning; whereas, before the arrival of the soldiers, they had been calling me every half-hour or every other -- or every hour.  And so I told them to hold on and that after my meeting with the soldiers, I will be able to provide some information to them.  But, Mr. Prosecutor, they did not call me again, and that was the small point I wanted to add to my testimony.  
Q.	Well, thank you very much.  That's helpful.  We were going to get to that, but now you've put it clearly on the record, so we can move forward.  

And to -- to summarise the most essential point is that you suggested to Bagosora that he contact the MRND leadership so that they could propose a substitute president for the head of state that had just died, and the understanding was that Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana would govern the situation with the assistance of whatever president was proposed by the MRND.  That was the -- that was the understanding when Bagosora left your residence that early morning; right? 
A.	That is correct.  He left in the company of General Dallaire.  They left together.  
Q.	And, of course, at that moment you realised that the people he was going to contact was Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Joseph Nzirorera and, perhaps, one or two others who were in charge of the MRND party.  
A.	Well, that was the political party which, according to the Arusha Accords, was supposed to be dealt with.  But in any event, I was not the one to select their spokesperson.  All I did was simply to contact all the interested parties or stakeholders, because, you know, that matter should not have been managed the way he had wanted to, that is, exclusively by the soldiers.  
Q.	Right.  Now, do you recall how many times you spoke with Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana that night? 
A.	We were in contact virtually throughout the night, almost every half-hour, and I also mentioned such to have been the case with the RPF.  Every party called me -- I mean, everybody called me.  The 
prime minister designate also called me as often as possible, but I cannot tell you the number of times, but it was up till about 8 a.m. -- or, in -- in the morning, or a few hours before the death of the 
prime minister that we were in contact.  We continued to talk throughout the night.  

Now, many people felt that I was in possession of a lot of information; whereas, I can tell you that I was not very well informed.  
Q.	In any case, by 8, 8:30, Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana -- excuse me.  By 8 or 8:30 you were able to tell Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana about your meeting with Bagosora and his refusal to involve her in the process.  And she was able to tell you, at least by 8:30, that two or three members of her government had already been abducted or killed by Rwandan soldiers.  Isn't that so? 
A.	First of all, I promptly reported to her upon the departure of the military delegation.  I told her about everything that we had discussed during the meeting.  Now, in the morning, we had another contact.  
As I have already told you, we had been in contact a number of times during which, for example, she had requested to be assisted in order to speak to the population by radio.  

So we continued to discuss these things throughout the night and up till the morning.  And then, at around 8 or 8:30, I realised that she was no longer answering her phone.  But she had already told me that she felt that some ministers were under threat because they had been abducted by uniformed persons.  
Q.	Do you recall the names of the ministers she told you had been abducted? 
A.	She mentioned the name of the minister of communication, and maybe of agriculture, and the 
apostolic nuncio also mentioned the abduction of the honorary consul of Luxembourg, who was Rwandan, but served as an honorary consul for Luxembourg in Rwanda.  I do recall that she made mention of the minister of information, the minister of agriculture, and maybe there were other ministers, but I -- I -- I did not pay -- rather, I did not dwell on that.  
Q.	So that would've been Frédéric Nzamurambaho; right? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I'm sorry, I do not remember the names of those ministers.  I'm able to remember their positions much more easily.  
Q.	In addition to being a minister of agriculture, he was also a head of the PSD.  He was the head of the Parti social démocrate; is that so?  The person that we're trying to identify now for the record.
A.	Yes, I think -- I think so, but I cannot make any conclusive assertions on that point.  He was a figure of distinction, of course, and he was such a figure in government and in his political party as well.  
Q.	And the other person you described was Félicien Ngango. 
A.	No.  I do not think so, because, during my tenure I do not remember Mr. Ngango being a member of government; I don't have a clear recollection.  But in any event, I did not meet him in his capacity as minister, if that were the case.  
Q.	Okay.  But by 4 o'clock -- I believe your -- your previous testimony was that it was only 
around 4 o'clock the following day that you had received confirmation from General Dallaire that 
Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana herself had been killed earlier that morning.  Is that so?  And if it's not, tell us when you first learned of the killing of Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana.  
A.	I am not able to give you the exact time, but the information was available on our Motorola communication system, and all those who were connected to the network were able to receive all the information relating to the death of the Belgian soldiers, the death of the prime minister and -- and other persons.  That information was available on our Motorola system.  

But up until that point, they were considered to be rumours because there was no substantive evidence of those incidents through the Motorola system.  So I say that we were able to receive the information through our system, and General Dallaire came in the afternoon to confirm the information based on bits and pieces of information that he had.  He didn't have much information, I must say.  
Q.	But in any case, by that day, or by that afternoon, you realised that Bagosora was responsible for all of these killings -- had ordered these killings of the prime minister and the other politicians that would've been needed to manage the situation by a civilian authority.  Isn't that so? 
A.	I did not come to that conclusion.  It was too early at that time to come to that conclusion.  One may have speculated or heard some rumours, but it was not possible at that time to come to the conclusion that you are suggesting.  
Q.	Well, when did you come to that conclusion? 
A.	We came to that conclusion -- and, by the way, I don't know which conclusion -- we came to the conclusion as to the liability of those who were leading the country much later on.  We had held a number of working sessions with representatives of our soldiers with a view to reaching a ceasefire.  We were seeking a ceasefire agreement, and we continued to work with those soldiers who were led by Colonel Bagosora.  

One could, therefore, not say off-the-cuff that we were dealing with somebody who was a murderer.  We were not a court jurisdiction, so to speak, but it was for us to make an assessment of the situation and then leave it up to those, who have power, to render judgement -- to come up with any sentences that may apply.
Q.	Well, that -- that much is clear, Mr. Booh-Booh.  But if you didn't realise it on the afternoon of the 
7th of April, surely, within the next few days, you realised that Bagosora and those with whom he associated with in the interim government was responsible for those killings.  And you said 
as much in your previous writings.  So within the first few days, you realised that those behind the interim government, including Bagosora, was responsible for those assassinations.  Isn't that the case? 
A.	Those were our apprehensions, yes -- our apprehensions.  You see, my role was not to try and convict, but to express apprehension.  Yes, indeed, we did have some apprehension.  Now, it is for others to look into all these matters and come to the necessary judgements.  
Q.	I take you back to the written answers that you gave to Professor Reyntjens back in 1995 when he was investigating this issue.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And it will be on page 9 of the English text.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And let me hand it up to you.
MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Issa could assist.  

I believe it is page 5 in the French text.  Pardon me, page 6 in the French text.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	The meeting that was proposed for the morning of the 7th of April never took place, or you were not able to attend.  I'm talking about the meeting with the other ambassadors and the military officers, Bagosora and the generals, and the other colonels that he was going to assemble, because there was difficulty in providing transportation for you to the American ambassador's residence.  But Bagosora showed up along with several others.  And the way you addressed it with Professor Reyntjens is as follows:

"This meeting could not hold because the soldiers and Hutu militia had blocked the streets of the capital very early on the morning of the 7th of April.  On the other hand, the FAR delegation led by Colonel Gatsinzi and composed of Colonels Bagosora and Ephrem Rwabalinda succeeded in going to the meeting at the residence at the US ambassador who received it all alone.  I was not informed of what was discussed during that meeting.  What a pity, for I think that the observers would have perhaps dissuaded Colonel Bagosora and his colleagues from doing what cannot be undone..." which is "ordering the heinous assassinations that we all know."  
A.	It is proper for you to have read that sentence, which has several shades of meaning and -- I say which may have "dissuaded".  I am not being assertive when I make that statement.  It was only a presumption on my part that if nothing was done, as indeed was the case, then the situation was going to worsen.  And it would only flow naturally therefrom that the soldiers, who were in control, would be subsequently deemed to have been responsible or liable for all what had transpired.  

I am not the one who conducted the investigations at all levels to come to such a conclusion.  However, it was my fear that -- since nothing had been done on the 7th of April at the American embassy, my fear was, therefore, that the situation, which was already not that good and which was in the hands of the soldiers, could have worsened as unfortunately turned out -- it turned out to be the case.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, you answered questions from Mr. Reyntjens, and you did it on a number of occasions, actually, and you know that Reyntjens was putting together material to make an analysis of the Rwandan crisis.  Did you ever read his book, the book that was the product of his questions to you and other persons that were involved?  The book entitled, Les Trois Jours qui ont Fait Basculer 
Le Monde? 
A.	I did not read it, and the professor was not so kind as to send me his study.  Maybe, if he is listening to us now, he may want to do so.  It's not late yet.  
Q.	In any case, Reyntjens develops this notion of a constitutional coup that was made on the night of the 6th to the 7th, because when Bagosora could not take over militarily and was unsuccessful with a military coup, he, along with Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera and the MRND, ensured -- or, let me rephrase my question or my proposition to you.  

The killings of Kavaruganda, Ngango, Lando, Uwilingiyimana -- the list goes on, everyone that was supposed to participate in the broad-based transitional government, all of the politicians that were either already in place or anticipated on the Arusha Accords, were all killed or abducted.  And, because they were no longer available, there was no state authority in Rwanda.  And there being no state authority, the MRND could assemble an interim government to its own liking.  

And he calls that a constitutional coup:  When the military could not take over, they destroyed all 
civilian authority that could, and replaced it by the interim government of the 8th of April 1994.  Do you have any disagreement with that proposition or would you like to comment?  
A.	My comments will be brief.  Upon the failure of the meeting with the ambassadors, there was a publication of a communiqué by the armed forces that was signed by Bagosora, which, apparently, was handing over power to civilians.  

Unfortunately, we only received that communiqué on the 8th.  That is rather late.  However -- indeed, as Professor Reyntjens says -- states that -- without using the word coup d'état, considering the assassinations that you referred to -- the MRND remained the only party that was in a position to run the affairs of the country.  Whether it is referred to as a coup d'état or any other name, the ultimate result was, indeed, what you stated.

BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	Thank you for that.  And I'd like to take us back to one of the earlier documents that we consulted, which is the communiqué from Joseph Nzirorera that was issued on the 10th of January 1994.  And he mentions a number of names in very critical terms.  He mentions Ngango, Maître Ngango.  He mentions Agathe Uwilingiyimana, he mentions Kavaruganda, Ndasingwa.  These are all the people that were killed or abducted on the night of the 6th to the 7th; isn't that so? 
A.	I can't tell if that was the night of the 6th to the 7th, but information about the assassin -- murders or abductions that I received was, rather, the 7th.  The 7th of April was the day of all the destructions.  Because once the prime minister of a country is -- is assassinated it shows the level of damage that had occurred, as from the 7th of April. 

So I didn't receive a report on the assassination or the abduction of each personality you mention.  But I'd like to tell the Chamber that, as from the 7th, information we received was disastrous. 
Q.	Now, you've told us, or you have testified previously, that you don't know how the 
	interim government was assembled.  But certainly you must have some idea of who the brains behind the interim government was, the conception of the interim government? 
A.	I don't recall having said it or not.  But if I did, it is not correct because, as of the 6th, the night of 
	the 6th, up to when I left Rwanda, I was not in touch, neither with the prime minister of the interim government, nor Colonel Bagosora, nor with anybody from that camp.  If I stated that, it was not true.  I had no contact with them.  I was not their mastermind and I wasn't there to tell them what had to be done, who had to be appointment (sic).  I believe that they were mature enough to assume -- to take up their responsibilities.  All they could have known was that we were against a military government, against any form of coup d'état.  They could have been sure of that. 
Q.	Well, thank you for that, Mr. Booh-Booh.  But when I use the phrase, "Brains behind the government" I'm actually quoting you.  That's why I put it to you in those terms.  

	So let me bring you back to how you answered Reyntjens's enquiry back in 1995.  And here I'm directing us to your answer of the seventh question from Reyntjens, which is on page 11 of the 
	English text, but it's the answer to the seventh question.  I don't have the page number in French.  And, apparently, he is asking you about how the -- interim government was formed.  And what you say is, "I do not know how the" -- interim -- "Government was formed.  I do not know who formed it" -- "or where it was formed.  I did not participate... 

	"Knowing my opposition to their political plan since the night of the 6 to 7 April, the brains behind this Government no longer approached me at all.  Until my departure from Kigali on 12 of May 1994, I met no member of this Government.  Each time, I gave reasons of unavoidable absence (insecurity or engagements in Arusha or Nairobi), in order to decline official invitations extended to me to meet them."  
	
	"You will not see me anywhere in a picture or film with members of this" -- interim -- "Government."  

So what I'm suggesting to you, Mr. Booh-Booh, is that it was clear in your mind, at least in terms of your responses to Reyntjens, that you had to distance yourself from a government that you considered criminal in its inception.  
A.	It is true that I distanced myself from a government where my background in law led me to 
characterise -- as being illegal.  Because when we get into the area of crimes and so on and so forth, I believe you have legal authorities which are empowered to deal with that in court.  Even though that happens, I don't believe that it is one individual -- even the special representative of the United Nations, would take upon himself to state what the crimes were.  

In my view, it was an illegal government, as there was a means to seek peaceful solutions to reach a consensus after all that had happened on the 6th of April. 
Q.	Well, thank you for that.  But what interests me is one little phrase from what I just read to you.  "Knowing my opposition to their -- their political plan since the night of 6 to 7 April." 

So you have already said it.   But I -- I suppose what I'm pointing out to you is that at its very inception, you could recognise the character of the government, the criminal character of the government that was created on the 8th of April 1994; right? 
A.	The illegal character is what I noticed.  You need to understand the nature of the office which I occupied in Kigali.  I represented the international community.  I represented the United Nations and the Secretary General of the United Nations.  

	I could have fears, apprehensions and ideas.   But to base myself on that to pass judgement as to who is a criminal and who is not, that is what I say -- although this may appear at some point in talk -- in time, that goes beyond my -- what I felt because I cannot pass judgement.  Otherwise this Trial Chamber would not be here, if all these judgments had been rendered by the UN 
	Secretary General's special representative.  

I had my suspicions, I had my emotions, you know.  But what you forget is that when people are dying, when people -- someone with whom you had spoken on the phone at 8 a.m. dies at 8:30 or 9 a.m., it's painful.  It goes beyond judgement or what it is, whatever.  You have human feelings.  And often that is something that is lacking with many people.  

So I did not convict, I did not judge.  I expressed my personal feelings.  And as a legal mind, a legal government, we know what it means.  But a criminal government, maybe there's need for some special theory to be drafted on that. 
Q.	Well, you must -- Mr. Booh-Booh, you must realise by now that a court has issued a judgement in respect to Théoneste Bagosora, at least, and found him criminally -- legally responsible for the killing of Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana.  You know that much, don't you? 
A.	I listened to extracts.  I didn't listen to -- I didn't become aware of everything that was said.  I listened to extracts of the judgement.  And I don't know whether it is already final. 
Q.	And you yourself have described the heads, or the running of that government, or the persons in that government, as a bunch of criminals.  That's in your own writing, in your own book.  So that's not really my dispute with you.  

I'm just trying to clarify when it became apparent to you that this was a bunch of criminals because that's how you yourself have described them.  And we can look together at page 154 in your book, 154 in the French text, page 12 in the English translation at the bottom of the page.  

But you can answer the question before you actually read the extract.  When -- when did you first become aware that this was a criminal government? 
A.	The word criminal is something I would like to review and place it in its proper context.  So if you could give me the references so that I will read what is in my book. 
Q.	Perhaps I'm overemphasising and being not -- not reading your words literally.  So let's read them and then you can comment on them.  

You are talking about the events of the night of the 6th to the 7th.  And at the bottom of page 12 in the English it starts out, "Moustache" -- which is a person that you're familiar with -- "called me a further three times and, speaking in a grave, despairing voice, asked to act fast.  We were about to reach a point of no return.  He did not tell me what ensued, something horrific.  The Prime Minister, who had sought refuge at the UNDP office, which, moreover, enjoyed diplomatic immunity, was brutally murdered along with her husband.  At that point we realised that we were dealing with a bunch of ruthless criminals."  

So you can explain that to us a bit more, if -- if you care to.  
A.	I am talking about a bunch of criminals because, on the 7th of April, at the time I am talking with Moustache when the prime minister was assassinated, there was -- you didn't have that famous 
interim government.  It wasn't yet -- had not yet been set up so I could refer to a bunch of criminals.  But what I would like to avoid stating is that it was a criminal government.  

There wasn't any on the 7th.  You had people, some came to -- saw me -- to see me and others were acting in other parts of the country.  But, in effect, after the assassination of high-ranking personalities of the country we -- our reflex, as humans, was that there was a force, which was indeed criminal in nature, that was in action.  

But I would like to state to the Chamber that there was no government and, less so, a 
criminal government, on the 7th.  I believe that was the apex of confusion in Kigali.  

But if you desire, if you wish I could -- yes, I agree with you that, as from the time when 
high-ranking officials were being killed, high-ranking officials of the country, that is, and since all of them were in the non-governmental movement, we had the feeling that the people who were doing it were a bunch of criminals.   That is a feeling we had.  

But, as I stated earlier, I didn't know any criminal government.  There was a government which was not legal.  And even that one, in the eyes of the representative of the United Nations -- I was not in a position to criticise it openly because, in UN practice, it is not forbidden for a UN representative to meet the people who are, indeed, the -- the de facto leaders of the country.  

And one week after, the Secretary General of the United Nations sent Mr. Riza, his special envoy, to meet the president of the interim government in Gitarama.  He did so without raising any controversy whatsoever.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Booh-Booh, it's clear that you had to interact to some degree with the interim government, because they were the political force on the ground.  So I'm not suggesting that there is anything improper about engaging in discussions with the persons who put themselves across as the 
interim government.  I'm simply trying to have you address now what you couldn't probably say back in April of 1994, which is that it was apparent to yourself and to all those that had anything to do with Rwanda in April 1994, that by the 9th or 10th of April it was clear that this was a criminal government.  

Let's look at one or two other documents.  Let me hand this up to Mr. Issa.  It's document number 7 in my bundle.  It's a code cable that you sent, Mr. Booh-Booh, on the 9th of April.  And I'm handing up the English to you since it bears your signature, and there's a French translation. 

But we'll direct our attention to paragraph 11 in that code cable.  It's document 7A and 7B in the bundle, as inscribed in the lower left hand corner.  And if you read it to yourself.  We don't have to read the whole thing into the record.  

But the beginning of paragraph 11 and the bottom of paragraph 11, clearly you are informing New York on the 9th of April that the military crisis committee is either behind the killings going on in Kigali, or is obviously tolerating the killings by the Interahamwe and the militia in Kigali.  You say, "If not actually conducting the terror campaign, they are at a minimum assisting, observing and not taking any action to maintain law and order.  Interahamwe and other mobs are continuing their campaign of ethnic and general violence."  

And then the last line, referring to the same military, "Large portions of their forces are implicated in the terror campaign."  Right?  

So at least on the 9th of April, if not the interim government itself, the military -- the military crisis committee that gave birth to it is directly implicated in the killings that are going on in Kigali.  And this is the information that you were passing to New York.  
A.	That's correct.  
Q.	Then there came a time later on in the month of April, the 27th of April to be exact, you met with a delegation of the interim government; isn't that so, in Nairobi? 
A.	That is so. 
Q.	So even though you told Professor Reyntjens in 1995 that you would never meet with them and that you didn't want to be seen with them, the documentation that we have in our files indicates that there was a meeting between you and Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Justin Mugenzi, André Ntagerura, 
Agnès Ntamabyaliro.  A whole delegation of the interim government that were on their way to Arusha met with you.  
A.	That's correct.   It is, indeed, correct that we were on our way to Arusha to negotiate a ceasefire agreement.  And, by chance, we were in the same hotel in Nairobi.  And, of course, we were -- we discussed our points of view with respect to the signing of a ceasefire agreement at that time.  

However, it was not an official meeting which was formal and which was prepared before.  Rather, we were headed for Arusha together with the main objective of reaching and signing a 
ceasefire agreement.  

So, yes, I need to remind you of that.  But it was not an official meeting.   It is as -- as if I met someone at the lobby and that they agreed to talk with me. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Booh-Booh, I'm not suggesting to you that there is anything improper about the 
special representative of the Secretary General meeting with the members of the government that was controlling the situation in Rwanda.  So I'm not suggesting that you did anything improper by meeting with them.  

All I'm suggesting is that it's contrary to what you told Professor Reyntjens and that at the time of that meeting you should have been able to recognise the criminal nature of that government.  That's all I'm saying.  There is no illegality in your speaking to these individuals.  

But we've already looked at a document dated the 27th of April.  It was placed in evidence by 
Mr. Nzirorera just two days ago.  D. NZ754.  So this is a document that you looked at just yesterday, or on Monday, yesterday when you -- during your direct examination.  

And here we have a code cable to Kofi Annan, signed by Booh-Booh, in French, saying -- and I'll read it in French, "The special representative received this morning the Rwandan delegation comprising of the following:  Ntagerura and Agnès Ntamabyaliro, Mugenzi."

(Pages 13 to 18 by Mark Mac Artain)


























1030H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	The special representative told the delegations that he regretted the fact that they did not meet in Arusha, and this goes on and on.  

But you certainly gave Kofi Annan the impression that this was more than a chance encounter by the elevator.  It sounds like you had a substantial meeting because it takes you three pages to describe the content and conclusions of that meeting.  
A.	Of course, when I read those words again, it reminds me of the fact that, indeed, before we met in Nairobi, we had seen each other -- we had seen ourselves in Arusha where the discussions were taking place.  We had been -- the members who were meeting in Arusha had drafted a -- a draft 
	ceasefire agreement, which was handed to me.  And if you read this text carefully, you see that they gave me this text for me to have it approved by the RPF and the interim government.  

So that was a mission I was on and which had been decided by the international community in Arusha regarding both parties.  So I couldn't avoid either of them.  And that -- that committee that met here comprised the Secretary General of the AN -- the African -- the Organisation of African Union, 
Ahmed Salim.  You had the Tanzanian foreign ministers and many ambassadors who were residents in Kigali and who sent representatives to attend the meeting.   

There was a draft agreement for a ceasefire agreement to be signed in Rwanda.  I believe that, of course, my contacts were also at that level. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Thank you.  

Your Honour, I see the time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Yes.  We take our mid-morning recess now. 
(Court recessed from 1032H to 1114H)
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, let me just indicate for the record that I was referring to a document earlier dated the 
	9th of April 1994, which I identified as a code cable from Mr. Booh-Booh to Mr. Annan on the situation in Rwanda.  This is an exhibit that's already in evidence, and I simply wanted to identify it for the record as P. 141. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Booh-Booh, getting back to the 27th of April, were you aware of a press conference that was organised by Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Justin Mugenzi, which was probably held sometime after they met with you on the morning of the 27th of April?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone. 
THE WITNESS: 
No.  I'm not aware of what that press conference was about. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Well, let me inform you that, I believe, it was recorded by RFI, Radio France International.  It was reported back in Rwanda or played back in Rwanda, and it generated some concern for the 
	U.S. State Department, who then contacted Colonel Bagosora and the interim government after that press conference was held.  

There was also a reaction by Human Rights Watch.  There was also an article in the Washington Post.  So there was quite a bit of a substantial reaction to that press conference.  Perhaps you just don't remember, but it seems unlikely that you of all persons would not have known about it, given the response it generated from several different reporters.  

In any case, let me tell you what Mathieu Ngirumpatse said during that press conference on the 
27th of April.  Here I'm referring to an exhibit that's already in evidence.  It's P. 276.  And as reported by RFI:  The president of the MRND, when asked by the -- I'm not reading it verbatim.  This is my summary.  When asked about the death of the prime minister, his response was:  The prime minister was attempting a coup.  Two weeks before the death of the president, she held a meeting with 
senior officers and submitted to them a plan for a coup.  

So you and I have just finished discussing the circumstances of Uwilingiyimana's assassination or killing.  That's how Mathieu Ngirumpatse described it to the world back on the 27th of April.  He was asked about the UNAMIR Belgian Blue Helmets that were killed.  And his response was that they were not killed in cold blood but during a shooting that started after a Belgian officer opened fire on the Presidential Guard.  

He was also asked about the fighting and the ongoing massacres.  And his response was that the massacres will not come to an end until the fighting stops.  And he was also asked about the Interahamwe militias and the MRND, and he denied that the Interahamwe were a militia of the MRND.  

And this particular report then goes on to describe the comments from Mugenzi, but those don't interest me at this moment.  

So, wouldn't you agree with me that all of these responses -- 
MR. WEYL:  
Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I have three objections.  The first is that:  What is the pertinence, relevance?  Secondly, which is subsidiary?  What are the grounds?  And thirdly, what is the procedure that the Prosecutor is using?  If the prior questions with respect to the relevance and the substantial issue of the lack of grounds has been sorted out, then the document which Mr. Webster is using should at least be given to the witness.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I can certainly give the document to the witness.  I just -- if Mr. Issa could hand this up. 

But in terms of relevance, this clearly goes to the legitimacy of the interim government and the way it was representing itself, and that was the line of questioning I was pursuing, so I'd like to continue.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We permit the questions to be answered.  We think it's relevant. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So I'll repeat or rephrase the question, Mr. Booh-Booh.  Putting yourself in the frame of mind of 
	27th of April 1994, wouldn't you agree that these responses from Mathieu Ngirumpatse were inadequate and probably -- or clearly a cover and inaccurate for what was really happening in Rwanda?  
A.	I didn't get to know about the contents of that press interview, but I had been informed that the MRND was broadcasting information that Madam Agathe Uwilingiyimana had been trying to conduct a 
	coup d'état prior to the events of the 6th of April.  I did receive that information.  Regarding the other pieces of information, I was not aware of it, but what I can tell the Chamber is that they are all at antipodes with the position of -- the UNAMIR position that have been shown in many texts and telegrams, which we have been looking at here in this Chamber for the past two to three days.  

On the contrary, if you allow me, I may want to add that, prior to that date, Mr. Mugenzi, who chaired one of the factions of the Parti libéral, had also held a press conference somewhere to accuse the UNAMIR of being partial and to further state that the MINUAR hosted in -- the UNAMIR hosted only Tutsis who were threatened and that the Hutus who had sought exile had been denied access to the UNAMIR headquarters.  Of course, that was all false and baseless. 
Q.	Thank you.  But with regard to the death of the prime minister -- I understand you coming back to rumours or propaganda or statements.  We can even call them statements from the MRND that the prime minister was going to hatch a coup.  But what I'm directing your attention to is that, when Mathieu Ngirumpatse was questioned about the death of the prime minister, he did not say that she was killed by Presidential Guards on the morning of the 7th of April, which is something you and I both know and which was obvious to anyone familiar with the situation back in April 1994.  Don't 
	you -- wouldn't you agree that his response to that enquiry was inadequate and was a camouflage for what actually transpired? 
MR. WEYL:  
Mr. President, an objection.  I believe that the witness has stated that he was not aware of the 
press conference itself.  So I find it hard to see how he can answer the question which Mr. Webster has just put to him.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, the witness can certainly answer the question.  I'm putting a proposition to the witness that this was what was reportedly said by Ngirumpatse, and in the context of the times, on the 
	27th of April, wasn't that response inadequate and a way of hiding truth?  So the witness can respond to that suggestion.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We have considered the objection, but we think the question can be answered by the witness.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Booh-Booh, can you please respond.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, I believe that I have already answered that question, namely, that the UNAMIR -- that UNAMIR's position was -- was at antipodes to the answers that the president or the chairmen of the MRND provided on the 27th of April, and that several messages had been sent in that regard on each of those issues to UN headquarters in New York.  Of course, as I stated before, I did not personally attend.  As a matter of fact, I did not get to know what the contents of that 
	press conference were.  These were very tense times regarding my schedule, and as a matter of fact, I wonder if I had not been in Kampala.  Having left Arusha, I had gone to Kampala to meet 
	President Museveni.  I can't properly situate the date, but I imagine on that day, on the 24th, I was still in Arusha and that after I went to Kampala in Uganda, but that doesn't change much.  

Had I known what those -- what that statement had been, we -- as far as we are concerned, we would have stated a position that was clearly opposite to what is said here, as we had information to do so.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  And just to be clear, let me indicate to you that my -- I'm raising this 
	press conference as an example, but my enquiry is really about the legitimacy of the 
	interim government.  And what I'm suggesting to you by raising the issue of this press conference is that already by the 27th of April this government had lost -- if it ever had any legitimacy, it had lost it and could be considered criminal just by virtue of the things that Mathieu Ngirumpatse is saying to cover up what it was really doing. 

So I would like to go on to the next exhibit, which is P. 278, which is a memo, a declassified memo from the US State Department.  There's an indication that the U.S. ambassadors on the 28th of April, after this press conference, spoke to Mugenzi "this morning by phone" is how it refers to the time that they spoke to him, and told him that the government statement was totally inadequate and wrongly equated the murder of civilians with combat between organised armies.  And in that same memorandum, it refers to a conversation that deputy assistant Secretary of State Bushnell had with Bagosora and recounts that Bushnell confronted him with eyewitness accounts of the Rwandan army complicity in the killings and said that "The world did not believe their party line."  

And there's another exhibit, P. 395, which is a telex from the US Department of State.  And again, this is from Bushnell to her embassy recounting her conversation with Bagosora.  She told Bagosora that "The world does not buy the government's story on the killings and that credible eyewitnesses and respected organisations reported Rwandan military complicity in the killings" and "that in the eyes of the world the Rwandan military is engaged in criminal acts, aiding and abetting civilian massacres." 

Human Rights Watch, in a press release of the 29th of April, reports that "The self-proclaimed government of Rwanda has launched an aggressive disinformation campaign in an attempt to justify the carnage that has overwhelmed the country.  Senior ministers have appeared not just in Nairobi but also in Paris and have indicated an interest in holding meetings elsewhere."  

Human Rights Watch "Welcomes the decision of the Belgium government to deny visas to representatives of this self-appointed regime and calls on other governments to do the same."  And there's several other documents that I can refer to to bring your attention to how the world perceived this interim government on the 27th of April, particularly, after -- or in light of the comments made by Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Justin Mugenzi. 

So bearing that in mind, I'll ask you again:  At what point did you recognise that you were dealing with a criminal government? 
A.	I didn't ask myself that question the way you are putting it.  It is with respect to the UN principles that I said that the United Nations was entertaining relations with all governments which are in control of a country.  

You have to understand that if the United Nations were to examine the legality or legitimacy of all those in power in the world and all the times, that would create a terrible disorder that's difficult to master.  So I believe that the United Nations deals with the people that they are talking with and who are those in power.  And I had no difficulty in meeting the members of the government and that the 
Secretary General, indeed, sent Mr. Riza to meet them in Gitarama - Gitarama and that it was done.  
I believe what you are trying to do is -- is to tell me your language.  The language of a prosecutor and the language of a diplomat are not the same.  We are saying the same thing, except for the fact that I don't want you to have me say what your position is.  I think we are in agreement in condemning this statement, which I didn't hear nor read anywhere, but in any case, by merely showing me this document, which is a summary of that press conference, I feel that the United Nations and the UNAMIR that I headed condemns it.  And you don't need to use the words "criminal", "legitimacy", so on and so forth.  That is your own way of saying things.  That is up to you, but please don't have me use the same language as you do.  
Q.	All right.  We can move on.  Thank you for your response.  But in any case, did you think that the RPF refusal to recognise the interim government was unreasonable in light of what the US government and Human Rights Watch and international reporting was saying about it and what you knew from being present on the ground?  You told us about your position or your awareness that the RPF had refused to negotiate with the interim government because they considered it criminal and illegitimate, and they wanted to negotiate with patriotic or responsible soldiers.  So I'm asking you now, putting yourself in the frame of the 27th of April, was that an unreasonable position to take? 
A.	It's not incumbent upon me to judge the position of a political entity I do not belong to, and I don't believe that United Nations had to take a position openly on that matter.  

Let me tell you something afterwards.  For a while the position of the RPF was ambiguous to a certain extent, considering the fact that they wanted to deal with some patriotic officers and did not want to deal with the people who had appointed it and who had given them the mandate to negotiate with the RPF, and that raised some problems for a while.  And the hope that as the -- I believe that their positions become clear as the war went on.  

What I wanted to say is that all those questions did not arise to us in the UN, but there was something that was done, namely, that during that period, Rwanda was -- had a seat as a non-permanent member of Security Council.  And the Security Council -- hence, the United Nations -- had decided to exclude it from that seat as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.  And while waiting to see the outcome of the war, that seat was unoccupied.  

So the United Nations, in its way, had reacted against the course of events and took that decision, which presupposes a gamut of consequences.  But once again, I was not given the mandate to come here and talk about on behalf of the United Nations in which I'm -- for which I no longer work.  But I am telling you true facts, and I'm also stating the position of the UNAMIR at the time of the events and which to a larger extent are in line with your own preoccupations.  However, I have to state that we don't have to describe the same facts using the same languages -- the same language. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you for your explanation.  But let me take you back to the 15th of April.  On that date, you attempted to broker a ceasefire agreement, and at that time the Rwandan government was represented by Marcel Gatsinzi, who we know was considered patriotic officer by the RPF. So if you put yourself back in the frame of mind of the 15th of April, wouldn't you agree that you had some high hopes or some enthusiasm or a good feeling for what could have developed from the negotiations that you were trying to organise with Marcel Gatsinzi back on the 15th of April? 
A.	High hopes, well, that would be exaggerated.  Counsel for the Prosecutor, I would like to revert to Professor Reyntjens' letter with respect to the interim government and the -- I won't take too much time.  Simply, what I'm trying to tell the Chamber is that, at the end of that letter, I clearly state that I had held that conference of the 15th of April with both parties involved.  So I indicated that exception.  But I also had to provide the other piece of information that in my mind these were contacts between UNAMIR and the interim government in Kigali or in Rwanda itself.  As I had said that I was gone now and -- on other occasions it was difficult for me to get to the meeting place.  So the Nairobi meeting probably took place in that context. 

The question you are asking has to do with the meeting of the 15th of April, which was difficult to convene because both parties were objecting -- objected to it.  The RPF was of the opinion that part of the interim government was composed of criminals, to use the words which you have used so many times, and that those criminals had to be arrested and that they didn't have to be part of a government. 

On the contrary, they were ready to work with patriotic officers who had been appointed by those criminals.  Logically, that doesn't make sense.  So we worked in that manner. 
Q.	Mr. Booh-Booh, all I'm suggesting to you is that, on the 15th of April, when you brokered a meeting to work out a ceasefire -- and on the Rwandan government side you had Marcel Gatsinzi, who on that date was the army chief of staff -- you felt positive about achieving something by way of a ceasefire.  And I would expect you to answer yes, because that same question was put to you back in 2005 when you testified in the Bagosora trial.  

So now that I remind you of how you addressed this issue five years ago, let me have your answer.  
A.	When a negotiation (sic) begins a negotiation, of course, he expects to have a result.  And in the instant case, we, indeed, hoped that we would have a result.  But we need to state that the result did not depend on the United Nations or on its representative.  Negotiations are firstly among Rwandans.  We are there -- as facilitators somehow.  So the negotiations could have been fruitful if all Rwandans desired it, or it would fail, as it was the case.  But although from the onset our priority idea is not to start negotiations if we are going to fail -- now if you would want me to summarise what happened, I can do so, but I believe that not everybody here is interested. 
Q.	No.  I don't think you need to summarise it, Mr. Booh-Booh.  What I'd suggest to you, however, is that on the 15th of April Marcel Gatsinzi was the chief of staff and there was some hope for negotiating a ceasefire.  But on the very next day, the 16th of April, the interim government removed him as 
	chief of staff and replaced him with Augustin Bizimungu, who Colonel Dallaire describes as a hardliner and an extremist.  And I believe that you acquiesced to that characterisation when this question was put to you back on the 22nd of November 2005, when the issue came up during your testimony in the Bagosora trial.  So really my proposition to you is very simple.  
A.	I find it difficult to involve myself with internal Rwandan problems, especially regarding political parties.  I didn't meet Colonel Bizimungu, and we didn't get a chance to meet.  But I know that he was working closely with General Dallaire, who had a lot of contact with the Rwandan military, indeed, on both sides, I must say.  

If he provides that description as a hardliner, with respect to Colonel Bizimungu, I would tend to believe that he -- his observation was grounded.  Colonel Gatsinzi was, indeed, replaced by our meeting -- after our meeting, yet, if I were to tell you what were the contents of what he said, you would realise that he was not far removed from the position of all his other military comrades.  

I think that that appears in one document, but since I was told not to get into the details of that meeting, he didn't appear to be pro-RPF in what he said in any special way.  He was not pro-RPF.  As a matter of fact, I would say that he supported the normal line of thought of the MRND, but he was dismissed after that meeting, and I am not in a good position to criticise or comment about it. 
Q.	And to conclude on this issue, I want to bring us back to your code cable of the 27th of April 1994 after you had met the delegation of the interim government.  The thrust of this code cable to me, anyway, seems to be the difficulty of moving ahead with negotiations, because the RPF refused to negotiate directly with the interim government and wanted to include military officers -- or wanted military officers to be representing the Rwandan side.  So that's the information that you're sending to New York and seemingly putting the accent or the emphasis on RPF intransigence as the stumbling blocks.  

My question to you now is:  Wouldn't it have been more appropriate, given the context and the circumstances, to inform New York about all of the killings and the disruption that seem to be the responsibility of the interim government? 
A.	UNAMIR on a regularly -- regular basis reported all the events that happened.  I fail to see why, at the time of signature of ceasefire agreement -- why all preceding problems known by the United Nations should have been raised.  Because, as I have been telling you, the last negotiations in Arusha were done under the auspices of the president of Tanzania, who, as a matter of fact, was the facilitator in the Arusha peace agreements. 

Therefore, I believe that my report to the Secretary General was limited to providing new information that could have hindered -- which could have hindered the situation.  As a matter of fact, at some pointed in time, I had to shuttle between both delegations to have them sign the same text, as both delegations did not want to meet each other and see each other, and they both had their reasons.  The RPF did not want to meet the people who they were referring to as criminals, and the interim government was not ready to be represented by soldiers, so said (sic) patriotic soldiers.  Whereas, the government which appoint them was not recognised by the RPF.  

So given those circumstances, we were leading -- heading towards a stalemate.  So the 
Tanzania facilitator, and everyone who was present there, including the Secretary General of the OAU at the time, had thought that that would be the solution, that I should be in a position to take the same text that was proclaiming the ceasefire to each of the parties, and that did not work.  So that is where I was.  If you take me back to the massacres and everything that happened before, I would also refer you to all the telegrams and all the cables that -- on that massacres which we sent to New York.  And we were not complacent.  But I can't -- at the time where we were looking for a ceasefire -- set aside that chance we'd been looking for, from both sides as a matter of fact, to revert to the massacres, indeed, to problems which we knew we had faced before and which had been stated in reports to the United Nations.  And so I believe that our work was done.  We did our job, and we could not have been late to do the job which other people would have loved to see us do. 
Q.	All right.  Mr. Booh-Booh.  I thank you for your responses.
MR. WEBSTER:
And, Your Honours, I have completed my cross-examination.  There are exhibits that I'd like to tender.  We can deal with it now, or I understand Mr. Robinson and the other Defence teams may have some redirect.  We could do it afterwards, depending on the Court's disposition. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, do you have any?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay. Mr. Booh-Booh, we're back together again.  And I'm going to try to start with the events of the 
	5th of January and the swearing-in of President Habyarimana.  And I have selected some contemporaneous documents to help us go through those events.  
MR. ROBINSON:
So I'd like to have my exhibits distributed and the witness shown two of those exhibits, which are Radio Rwanda transcripts.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Booh-Booh, we'll start with trying to reconstruct exactly what happened on that day.  And I believe you were present, and so it should be helpful to you.  

You have two documents in front of you with the identical face page, which are from a broadcast on Radio Rwanda.  Looking at the second page of one of those documents, you'll see at the top it says "Face B", and it is listed as page 18.  That's the one I want to look at first.  Do you have that?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness's microphone was off.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So right in front of you that top page says, "Face B".  This begins with:  Louise Kayibanda, the journalist of Radio Rwanda.  This is in French, so you are going to be able to read this better than I.  At the bottom of the page, you see an intervention from Louise Kayibanda, in which she says that all of the personalities are here at the ceremony.  There is the president and his advisers, the president of the constitutional court, and she noted the presence of the special representative of the Secretary General, Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh, the diplomatic corps, members of the government, the deputies of the national assembly, other representatives of civil society in the country.  And the security was assured by the UNAMIR in collaboration with the Rwandan army.  She indicates that after the first part the 
chief of state will swear in the deputies of the national assembly at 3 p.m. or 1500 hours in conformance with the programme that had been set the night before. 

Then you'll see that President Habyarimana makes an address and announces after his swearing-in that the ceremony will be adjourned until 3 o'clock in the afternoon, at which time the deputies of the assembly will be sworn.  Do you see all that?
(Pages 19 to 28 by Deborah Gentile)

















1200H 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can see the passage. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And do you remember yourself being present that morning on the 5th when President Habyarimana was sworn in and the proceedings were adjourned until 3 p.m. for the swearing-in of the transitional assembly? 
A.	Yes, I attended in my capacity as a special representative. 
Q.	Now, the next part of the narration from the journalist is reporting from the afternoon, and it's on the bottom of the page we just looked at after President Habyarimana's acclamation.  It talks about what's now happening in the -- that afternoon.  And basically what she says is that all the people assembled again, but they noted the absence of the president of the court -- the constitutional court 
	Joseph Kavaruganda, as well as deputies from the RPF, the PSD, six deputies of the MDR, one deputy of the PDC, and the PL with the Lando faction, but present in the hall at 3 p.m. were the 
	MRND deputies, the PL-Mugenzi faction and some other political parties.

But there was an appeal to boycott the ceremony indicated by the presidents of the MRND, PSD, PDC and PL -- PL.  And despite that, there were some deputy --  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me.  Maybe there is a translation error.  

Let me repeat those again because there was an error in translation, or perhaps I misspoke.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So there was present the deputies of the MRND, the PL of the Mugenzi wing? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, you said MRND.  Did you mean that?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I meant that at this stage, yes, those who were present.  I'm going back a little further.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So MRND, PL-Mugenzi wing and a number of other parties were present.  And those -- there had been apparently a boycott of the ceremony ordered by the president of the MDR party.  That's MDR as well as PSD, PDC and PL.  

Now -- then the president goes on to indicate that because of the absence of the president of the constitutional court and the absence of the deputies of the RPF and the other parties, it was necessary to adjourn that session.  And is that actually what happened, Mr. Booh-Booh, on that day? 
A.	I can say yes, in respect of the chronology of events.  But I'm not in a position to say which deputy or which party attended or did not participate.  

But from a chronological standpoint, that is how things unfolded, and as any well brought-up diplomat would do, they answered the invitation from the president of the republic -- they honoured the invitation from the president of the republic and spent several long and lengthy hours idly waiting for a ceremony which never took place. 
Q.	And now I would want to focus on why those people didn't show up at 3 o'clock.  And if you look at the other transcript of the broadcast that's in front of you, the one that has the same cover page.  

But now we're going to the first page of the other broadcast.  It's of the same day and has the number 9 at the top.  So can you find that?  It's the second page of the radio broadcast.  It has the page number 9 at the top.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Maybe Mr. Issa can assist him to find that.  

It's K number 0150875.  0150875.

Thank you, Mr. Issa.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Mr. Booh-Booh, you see that there's once again repeated an announcement by 
	President Habyarimana.  And then where the speaker is the journalist Boniface Murutampunzi, he says that he's received a communiqué signed by Faustin Twagiramungu, the president of the -- for the MDR, Frédéric Nzamurambaho for the PSD, Jean Népomuscène Nayinzira for the PDC, and 
	Landouald Ndasingwa for the PL.  And this communiqué appeals to the deputies of the different political parties not to return to the assembly nationale for presentation of the transitional government that afternoon.  And this was broadcast on Radio Rwanda on the 5th of January 1994.  

Now, I would like to also have you shown a letter that's also one of our exhibits from 
Agathe Uwilingiyimana on the same day to the president of the constitutional court, Mr. Kavaruganda.  

Do you have that in front of you? 
A.	I cannot find the document.  I'm not able to locate it from the documents before me.  Please, can you mention the number of the page of the French document. 
Q.	It's a separate letter.  It's not one of the radio broadcasts.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. Issa, can you assist him?    

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	On the top it's stamped, "Trés urgent".   
A.	I am there now. 
Q.	Okay.  So you see it's a letter from Madam Uwilingiyimana to the president of the constitutional court, the subject concerned putting in place the transitional institutions.  

And can you do us a -- can you do me a favour and read aloud the second paragraph of that letter.  
A.	"I have the honour to inform you that following the swearing-in of the president of the republic which took place this morning, 5 January 1994.  All other ceremonies which were equally planned for today have been postponed until further notice."  Signed the prime minister, Madam Uwiling - 
	Madam Agathe. 
Q.	Mr. Booh-Booh, I suggest to you that the reason why the deputies or these people didn't show up, including the president of the constitutional court, in the afternoon was not because the Interahamwe had blocked their way but because they themselves had chosen to boycott those proceedings.  Can you comment on that? 
A.	I must say that the information available at that time was about a misunderstanding between the president of the republic and his prime minister on the issue of lists of deputies and lists of members of government.  The two heads of the executive had not yet come to an agreement on that issue.  That was the explanation that was given to us on the situation which led to the postponement of the afternoon ceremonies, that is, the afternoon of the 5th of January.  

It is true that I was not aware of any ongoing violence in the afternoon outside the premises of the conference hall or in any roads around the conference centre.  I was not aware of any such violence.  But as I stated yesterday or the day before, I was duly informed in the morning that acts of violence had been perpetrated with a view to stopping some candidates to the position of member of parliament or to ministerial position or stopping them from accessing the CND, that is, the parliament where the ceremonies were expected to take place.  

As you know, those are problems which were managed by my collaborators who were paid to do that kind of work.  And they produced summaries and reports of what they had observed in the streets.  

I wasn't there myself to make those observations.  So I am not in a position to give you any details beyond that which I have already stated.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  And can we agree that the RPF representatives were already at the CND.  That's where they were housed.  So they didn't have any traffic problems that day?  If they showed up or didn't show up, it wasn't because of anybody blocking their way, correct? 
A.	I think that in the morning everybody was in the hall, otherwise the swearing-in of the president would have lacked some credibility, should I say, because of some legal or political shortcomings.  The entire process of the implementation of the Arusha Accords was based on a measure of consensus.  And where there is consensus on a particular phase or particular stage of the process, everybody would have to be present.  

And I, therefore, presume that when the president of the republic took the oath of office, all those who were interested by the event and who were invited to it must have been present in the hall.  Otherwise, I would have been informed accordingly.

And then in the afternoon we ran into complications.  Problems had began to emerge.  And I'm therefore not able to tell you whether in the afternoon everybody was present at the CND hall waiting for the commencement of the ceremonies for the swearing in of the deputies and ministers.

I'm not able to make such an assertion 17 years later.  You may need to look to the archives for that kind of information.  

What I can say, however, is that in the afternoon while we were waiting for the deputies and the ministers to be sworn in, I was not given notice of incidents that would have been similar to that which may have happened in the morning.  
Q.	My only question really was that the RPF deputies, they were housed at the CND, were they not?  So they didn't have to go anywhere on the road.  They were there in the morning for the swearing-in.  They had their residence and whatever other accommodations they had right there at the same place.  And then they were due back there at 3 o'clock.  So it was not a situation of being stopped in traffic for those people, correct? 
A.	The deputies and ministers of the RPF, indeed, lived within the premises of the assembly where the ceremonies were expected to take place.  So it is true they did not encounter any obstacles as such because they did not have to drive through any roads to get to that location because they were already within those premises, that is, the premises of the Rwandan parliament where the ceremonies were expected to take place.  They, therefore, could not raise any issues of violence or provocation as an excuse for not attending the ceremony.  But they could have had other political reasons for which they may have chosen not to attend. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Booh-Booh.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
And, Mr. President, I would like to move for the admission of the two radio broadcast transcripts.  Actually, they're part of the same day.  So I think we could simply admit them as one exhibit, which would be D. NZ755. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ755 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
And then I would ask that the letter from President Uwilingiyimana be admitted as D. NZ656 -- 756. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It was probably sent by fax.  Is there a version which shows which date it was sent?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
This was the only version I received from the Prosecution.  But perhaps Mr. Webster could have the people from the evidence unit check and see if there's any other copies of this. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Of the letter signed by Madam Uwilingiyimana?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.
MR. WEBSTER:
We can look for it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

It will be admitted in the meantime.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ756 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Mr. Booh-Booh, if we could look at the last document.  And we're going to shift our attention now to the demonstration of the 8th January 1994.  And here what we have in front of you is a document from General Ndindiliyimana, the head of the gendarmerie, who explains from his perspective what happened on the 8th of January.  And I would like to direct your attention to the page that has the number 13 -- actually if we maybe start at page 11.  I'm sorry about that, but they might orientate you a little bit better.

Mr. Booh-Booh, in this document, first General Ndindiliyimana is saying that there was a rumour circulating that there was going to be a ceremony to put in place the transitional institutions on that day, but in fact no such ceremony had ever been scheduled.  Is that consistent with your recollection?  
A.	As far as I know, no such ceremony had been planned for the 8th of January 1994. 
Q.	And then General Ndindiliyimana describes how he went to the place, which is essentially the roundabout between the Méridien hotel and the CND, and that there were some people there.  And that he essentially explained to those people that this was a rumour circulated by irresponsibles and that there was not going to be any ceremony that day. 

And then he on page 12, in the middle of the page, he indicates at around 10 o'clock the president passed through without stopping with his escort followed by the representative of the secretary general, Mr. Booh-Booh.  Do you recall that?  
A.	On the 8th January, no, that is not correct.  

If you want me to give you my position, this is what I would say:  Very early in the morning some UNAMIR soldiers had informed me that something was cooking, some strange thing was cooking, and they asked me not to leave my residence.  So I spent the entire morning without leaving my residence.  

But then the president was allegedly informed that I had been attacked by demonstrators, and he apologised several times over and over because he kept apologising for the unfortunate thing that had happened to me, but that was not true because I hadn't left my house on that day.  It was true that I went to meet him in the afternoon along with the other political parties for negotiations.  

So on the 8th I wasn't part of the president's escort, and I think that this is in fact incorrect.  And if you want me to tell you what I was told, then I could do so. 
Q.	Yes.  Go ahead.  
A.	What I was told is that a demonstration actually took place, and that cannot be denied.  Now, what the levels of violence at that demonstration were I do not know because I wasn't given any exact description of the nature of the violence.  

However, some vehicles and some UNAMIR staff were rough handled during those demonstrations.  I do not know whether the intent was wicked, but some of them stated that they had been robbed of their wristwatches and probably wallets.  That is what I was told.  No one seems to have been wounded.  No one seems to have been killed. 
Q.	And do you see on page 13, the statement from Lieutenant Marchal, or Colonel Marchal, that the manifestation on the 8th January 1994 was not violent?  There was no arms, no grenades and no need for the special battalion of the Belgian contingent to intervene.  
A.	That point of view expressed by Colonel Marchal is one that I am simply discovering.  And I notice that, as I was told, there was no wounded person and there's no mention of any presence of firearms.  But I was told -- and I'm simply repeating what I was told -- is that some youth, who must have been 
	MRND militia, attacked a number of persons.  

I have told you already that throughout the afternoon the president continued to apologise to me or to extend his apologies to me because he had received a report that the representative of the 
Secretary General had been attacked.  And that was on the 8th of January, but as I have already told you that was not true because I didn't go out of my residence when those demonstrations were taking place. 
Q.	And it's true, isn't it, that there was a lot of false information or misinformation swirling around in Rwanda in this period, January to April 1994?  
A.	That is correct. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that the document from Colonel -- General Ndindiliyimana be admitted as 
D. NZ757. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I have a question on what evidentiary principle is being offered since the witness contradicted what Ndindiliyimana said.  Ndindiliyimana presented the situation where the witness was in a convoy with the president, and the witness clearly denied that.  So I don't understand why it would be offered for admission. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
It can be received for identification, Mr. President.  It's no problem. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We'll mark it for identification.

Mr. Issa.  
MR. MJUI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  

The document will be ID. NZ72.  Thank you.
(Exhibit ID. NZ72, marked for identification)  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Would you like to take the luncheon recess now at this time?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
How much longer do you think you might have?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Between 30 minutes and one hour. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Would any other Defence teams need to conduct examination of this witness?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
No, Mr. President.

I simply want to remind you that I still have a document to produce. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, we do not have a priori any complementary examination for Mr. Ngirumpatse. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.

We take our luncheon adjournment now. 
(Court recessed from 1232H to 1412H)  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Booh-Booh.  
A.	Good afternoon, Mr. Robinson. 
Q.	We're on our last phase here, so that'll be good news for everyone probably.

Now I want to ask you about the CDR.  There was nothing wrong with the CDR party having a seat in parliament once they signed the code of conduct under the code of conduct, correct?  
A.	Well, that required the consent of everybody including the RPF. 
Q.	Well, didn't the Arusha Accords stipulate that if a political party had agreed to sign the code of conduct they could be given a seat in the transitional assembly? 
A.	The Arusha Accords provided for that.  But as you do know, when the political situation gets complicated, the fact that the RPF did not sign its copy of the agreement -- get it signed by the CDR -- blocked everything.  Since it required that all those who had signed the peace agreement and that each one had received a copy of the agreement -- would enable the CDR or any other party which in fact fulfilled the conditions to sign on their own copies.  

If one of the parties -- one of the main parties, like the RPF, refuses to sign its copy of the 
Arusha peace agreements for the CDR, you understand that politically things would come to a halt.  We witnessed this type of situation where -- which was tantamount to a veto.  It was like having veto rights because its -- all it required was for one country to have a copy and refuses to get it signed by the CDR and the CDR could not get into the political scene.  And when the failure of all the negotiations and mediation -- I think that this agreement was supposed to be surrounded by general consensus 
beyond -- in spite of the political games carried out by this or that party.  

But we really couldn't make any progress without a general consensus.  To me, that seems to have been the underlying philosophy of the Arusha agreements. 
Q.	And you supported the inclusion of the CDR in the transitional assembly even with its extremist views, correct? 
A.	Yes, but within the framework of certain consultation and acceptance by the RPF.  I believe I shared with you my thoughts a few minutes ago.  The CDR fulfilled the conditions laid down by the 
	Arusha agreement.  But these conditions were underpinned by the fact that there was need for a certain consensus by the signatories of that agreement and, namely, by the principal main signatories.  That is the two.  And nothing could budge without reaching a consensus and particularly these agreements between the two, and that was why we fostered or enhanced or facilitated their meeting at the UNAMIR.  But you needed that consensus.  That consensus had to be reached. 
Q.	And not only you, but even the RPF's strongest allies -- the ambassador of Uganda, the ambassador of the United States -- all urged the RPF to agree because the CDR was entitled to be admitted, correct? 
A.	I do not know whether the countries that you just cited were in alliance or supporters of the RPF as you said.  Well, that's up to you, Counsel Robinson.  It's your word on that issue.  

But what I can say is that if everybody ended up accepting that the CDR should be part of the institution, it was as a reply to a number of arrangements that were supposed to follow because the CDR had accepted to respect the peace agreements, something which it had not done before.  This time it had accepted that it would respect the -- the code of ethics, politically speaking.  And so it was a matter of accepting the CDR, and President Habyarimana was going to put an end to his claims or his grievances concerning the liberal -- concerning the Parti libéral.

That was the thrust of the arrangement that was made by the international community including the special representative for the United Nations as they wanted to have things worked out.  

And as you know, in any compromise there's always a limping side.  There is always a party which does not satisfy everybody.  In negotiations you always get to that stage or a point where you have an agreement or -- you agree on a number of things.  If you remain in slogans and anathema, then there would not be any broad-based government.

And so this was a deal which -- a deal, as the English would say.  English is a language which I do not master.  But, as I say, it was a deal that was arrived at.  It was a gentlemen's agreement in which we accepted this.  "But Mr. Habyarimana will accept this on condition that you allow us to move forward with your problem with the Parti libéral, the Islamic party, and all of that.  We are going to agree on the basis of a consensus."  That was what the international community had in mind. 
Q.	Now, is it fair to say from the period January to April 1994 there was a political power struggle in Rwanda with both sides jockeying for advantage? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And is it also fair to say that during that same time there was a military power struggle with both parties preparing for war while at the same time entering into political negotiations? 
A.	You need proof for that.  Certainly, it may have existed.  But you must come up with proof to that effect.  We had wind to the effect that weapons were being infiltrated into the country, but personally I had no proof about that. 
Q.	Well, President Kagame didn't mince any words when you met him in March about preparing for war, did he? 
A.	I took that as a political struggle.  You know that today war involves heavy weapons clashing, but you also have psychological warfare.  And that was why I told you that the radio stations, which were crossing swords in Kigali at the time, it was just part of it all.  It was normal.  It was expected.  It was their own way of carrying on the fight without having to pull the trigger of the Kalashnikov, nor having to throw grenades here or there.  But both parties -- both parties were in a psychological war. 
Q.	Now, I want to ask you about the difference between the arms caches, on the one hand, and extermination of Tutsis, on the other.  It's true, is it not, that you knew about allegations of arms caches, but you knew nothing about a plan for extermination of Tutsis, correct? 
A.	So far as I am concerned, and I have said this repeatedly, I had the mandate to work, to act in a bid to put an end to the existence of any arms caches.  I was assigned to put an end or hinder the distribution of weapons to the Interahamwe or MRND militiamen.  But, in all honesty, I never saw any documents about Tutsis being exterminated per minutes, per second or per hour.  I saw nothing of the kind.  

Now, you can either believe me or not believe me.  But that is how I handled that situation.  And by the way, I must say that it was a situation which started off from an act of indiscipline.  

I am the head of UNAMIR with authority over all the units of the UNAMIR.  Now, how can a document of that magnitude, of such importance -- would leave UNAMIR without going through the normal channel and goes as far as a chameleon officer in New York who secreted it all over.  I did not have a knowledge of that document.  

And to go even further, I was not under the orders, nor under the caprices of General Dallaire.  He was not the one to take any political decisions or measures.  Maybe people -- some would think that that is what happens normally, indiscipline.  And in respect of hierarchy elsewhere, that can happen in the folklore of Africa.  

So I did not get to know that document.  And I have repeated this several times.  I only got into the game after New York gave my instructions, after New York sent me a cable, because New York alone was empowered to give me instructions, and not General Dallaire.  I think that anybody with his head on his shoulders should understand what I am saying, and everybody would understand it normally.

When headquarters asked me a number of things to get done, I got to work without bothering myself with how come General Dallaire contacted New York.  But we worked together to put an end to the accumulation and eventual distribution of weapons.  We worked together.  I can tell you that.  

So I wanted to let you know that the link between the arms caches and the death of Tutsis may appear to me obvious because the conflict was not going to unfold in -- on Mars, the planet Mars.  It was taking place in Kigali, in Rwanda, right here on Earth.  

And we know the extent to which such an operation of stocking weapons in an arms cache was dangerous, not only for any ethnic group that you want to magnify or exalt or put in front, but there were other Hutus who came and sought refuge there at UNAMIR and who also were afraid for their lives.  

There was a diplomatic community there in Kigali which could also be a victim to the existence of these weapons.  There was, of course, UNAMIR which was also exposed to the consequences of any distribution of weapons which may culminate in a situation of violence or generalised violence.

So that's what I can tell you.  There certainly was a link between the arms caches and all these consequences which I just enumerated.  And that was why we took the issue very seriously at the United Nations.

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Booh-Booh, might it have been an explanation that the information about the termination of Tutsis provided by Jean-Pierre was neither considered to be reliable or credible enough to even bring to your attention? 
A.	Well, I have the impression that that figure must have startled many persons in New York, that 
	2,000 or 10,000 Tutsis were going to be killed every 20 minutes.  But I think that there are some intelligent people at the United Nations, some people who are certainly more intelligent than those of us in this hall.  They certainly understood that this business, this issue would really not need to insist so much on it.  But rather to insist furthermore on the arms caches, on the distribution of weapons, on the violence which was virtually endemic in Rwanda at the time.

For all the time I spent in that country, there had always been problems of violence.  Every day people came to report, to complain, at UNAMIR seeking assistance, seeking intervention of CIVIPOL, of the civil police, of UNAMIR day after day.

Now, the problem of Tutsis being killed did not strike minds enough in New York as that of weapons which had to be neutralised.  And when I say this, it is with all -- how do I say this.  It is with the possible confirmation of the European ambassadors and even the American ambassador who also read the message from New York and who also got to work in a bid to get President Habyarimana to step down because personally he was targeted in the message that was sent to us, and he -- it was he that the message was addressed to.  He was the one who was being asked to put an end to this situation of the existence of weapons and the distribution of weapons and to put an end to the distribution of weapons 
Well, that is what I know.  Right here I'm mishearing various versions, but anyone is free to carry out his own speculation on the situation which, once again -- I repeat -- started off beyond my authority, unknown to me.  I want this to be taken down.  It was when things went out of hand that I was called upon to get into the picture, to carry out certain investigations, and to draw the attention of the 
president of the republic. 
Q.	Mr. Booh-Booh, you testified in the case of Bagosora and three others -- and General Dallaire also testified in that case -- Colonel Marchal.  And the Trial Chamber in that case reached some conclusions after six years of trial.  And I want to read some of them to you starting with paragraph 522.

They say, "In sum, the information provided by Jean-Pierre lends some credence to the fact that the Interahamwe received training and had secret caches of weapons.  However --- ''The Chamber is hesitant to rely on his assertion that the purpose of these activities was to kill Tutsis, as such." 

At paragraph 13 it says that, "The Chamber certainly accepts that there are indications which may be construed as evidence of a plan to commit genocide, in particular when viewed in light of the subsequent targeted and speedy killings immediately after the shooting down of the president's plane.  However, the evidence is also consistent with preparations for a political or military power struggle and measures adopted in the context of an ongoing war with the RPF that were used for other purposes from 6 April 1994.

"Consequently, the Prosecution has not proven beyond reasonable doubt that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence is that the four Accused conspired amongst themselves or with others to commit genocide before it unfolded from 7 April 1994.  The Chamber has acquitted them of the count of conspiracy."

Now, is there anything from your experience in Rwanda that would cause you to disagree with that conclusion?
A.	Mr. Robinson, all those who have studied law including yourself and some of us who are here, as many as we are -- we all know that any commentaries about judgements which are res judicata should not be criticised or commented upon in a manner that can contribute to what's negating or watering down the scope of the judgement.

How do you expect that I, as a former special representative of the UN to Rwanda -- how do you expect me to make a comment on a judgement here before the Court?  By the way, I asked a question here today in a bid to know whether this was a final judgement or not.  All I can say is that I have no comment to make on a judgement that has been handed down by this Court by this judgement.  And my position would be the same if I were dealing with judgements rendered in my country at the 
national level.  So I think we have to respect judgements that are handed down by the courts.  
Q.	Okay.  Fair enough.  Let's talk about the shooting down of President Habyarimana's plane.  Wouldn't you agree that it's crucial to know who shot down that plane in order to really understand the culpability of individuals for the events which followed from the 6th of April? 
A.	I am in favour of conducting an investigation.  By the way, in a communiqué released by UNAMIR after the crash of the presidential plane, plane -- had called for such an investigation. 
Q.	When you were answering questions for Mr. Webster, he was asking you whether Bagosora was a criminal.  And if indeed Bagosora and others, maybe Mr. Nzirorera -- if they had shot down that plane to start some kind of a programme to exterminate Tutsis, there would be no doubt that they would be criminals, would there?
A.	I believe that only a Tribunal like this one can determine who is a criminal and who is not a criminal.  I am sure that you will agree with me that if I had had the power to make that determination, this Tribunal may never have been set up. 

All these problems really should be solved or resolved by judges or by impartial international commissions which can look into these matters as, by the way, has been requested by a number of countries. 
Q.	But if the RPF shot down that plane, that puts the events in a different light, doesn't it?  That would be a breach of the Arusha Accords, wouldn't it?
A.	Please let us not play on theories and hypothesis and fiction politics.  Why "if"?  Why "if", as if we were going to use the "ifs" to end up in some absurd situation.  I think the best way to proceed in dealing with this problem is really through an investigation, because I even raised the question in my book:  What happened at the Kigali International Airport on the 6th of April which at the time was under UNAMIR control?  What happened?  What was done thereafter by way of securing the evidence for purposes of investigation.

All those questions I raised in my book, and I believe that we need to find answers to those questions.  But if we were to conjecture that had it been this way or had it been that person or had it been that other thing, maybe this and that would have happened.  Simply put, I do not have any opinion on that matter. 
Q.	Well, you would agree, would you not, that if the RPF had shot down the plane you wouldn't expect the MRND and the other signatories to have to honour the Arusha Accords.  And, therefore, your assumption that the government, interim government, was illegal would not be correct, would it?  Since the Arusha Accords had been breached, there would be no obligation for the other signatories to continue to honour the provisions; correct? 
A.	Mr. Robinson, maybe you need to clarify your question a little further so that we do not mix up issues, all issues.  The problem of the presidential plane is a serious problem.  I believe that you are right in asking the question in much the same way as many countries have raised that question.

But from putting the question to drawing a conclusion, without a reliable investigation having been conducted, I believe this would lead us into mixing up all manner of issues.  You know very well that not too long ago a report was issued in Kigali dealing with the problems arising from that crash and ascribing responsibility to Habyarimana's own friends.  Now you have suggested that it is the contrary that obtained, namely, that it was the RPF and its friends who did it.

So how do you expect that in this courtroom we can come to a decision about these two positions that are so mutually exclusive?  How can we do that?  If we were going to attempt, we would not be able to come to any agreement. 
Q.	But your testimony that the government was illegal presumes that they were obligated to follow the Arusha Accords, does it not? 
A.	In law when one says that a government is illegal, what does that mean?  It means that the constitution of the country has not been respected.  It means that there are provisions relating to the disposition of power that have not been upheld.  It means that you come to the conclusion that the law has not been upheld.  That is my understanding of an illegal government.   

It might well be a de facto government because the law does recognise a de facto government, doesn't it.  But I think that it is on the basis of that de facto recognition that the United Nations can deal with governments that are running a country without going into the details as to how they came to power.  Because if you were to proceed in that manner for all states -- member states of the United Nations, you will be getting into a very complex situation for the United Nations.  That is why my concept of illegality flows from the fact that there were instruments in place that governed the setting up of a government within legal parameters.

You know very well that the paradox in Rwanda was that there were two constitutions in place, the first being the constitution of 11th -- or should I say the first constitution was still in place.  And then there were the Arusha Peace Accords which amounted or were perceived to be a constitution.

And those are the problems, the substantive legal problems, that arise when we deal with this matter to the extent that there were two applicable constitutions at the same time in the same country.  Let me further say that the Arusha Accords had higher authority than the constitution which was in place before the signature of the Arusha Accords.

So there you had two constitutions in the same country at the same time.  So I believe that intelligent people of good faith would have found the necessary legal arguments within those two constitutions that would have made it possible to set up a legal government.  And I don't think that was done. 
Q.	Mr. Booh-Booh, I'm going to ask that you be shown Exhibit D. NZ425 which was a legal opinion offered by Ralph Zacklin, the director of the office of legal affairs for the United Nations, after you left.  And I'd like to look at that document with you together because I believe it's contrary to your own -- what you are believing here.

So this document has a cover page, and then there's the memo from Mr. Zacklin.  And it asks -- he says that, "In your cable of the 24th of May 1994 you requested the legal advice of this office on the following questions:  A, is the interim government in Gitarama a successor government to the legitimate government of Rwanda?"

And we'll skip B for the moment.  And then looking at paragraph 1, "Although the Arusha agreement by its terms had come into effect upon signature and President Habyarimana was subsequently sworn in as president, the transitional assembly and the other organs of the transitional government were never established.  

"Therefore, the government of Rwanda, which ceased to exist shortly after the death of the president on 6 April 1994, was not the transitional government.  Consequently, the Arusha agreement, including its succession provisions, are not applicable to the succession issue.  That question would, therefore, be governed by the constitutional law of Rwanda."  And then it goes on.

And I'll inform you, Mr. Booh-Booh, that the constitution of Rwanda provided that the president of the national assembly was to be named interim president in the succession rules of that constitution.  And that was exactly what the MRND suggested and what was done when Mr. Sindikubwabo was named president.  

So would you agree that even the United Nations legal officer -- the chief legal officer of the entire United Nations accepted the fact that the Arusha Accords did not apply at the time of the death of President Habyarimana?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Sorry.  I don't have an objection to the witness answering this question because I'd like to hear his response as well, but I think to be fair to the witness, the entire passage should be read to him so he can understand it in French translation.  And I can give my reasons for making that suggestion, but I would rather that we just allow the witness to hear the entire passage, and I can offer reasons if Mr. Robinson requests me to do that.   
MR. ROBINSON: 
That's okay, Mr. President.  I can read the rest of it.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Mr. Booh-Booh, after the sentence that says, "That question would, therefore, be governed by the constitutional law of Rwanda", it goes on to say, "Moreover, the factual situation inside Rwanda has yet to stabilise with de facto authority apparently being exercised by several competitors for power.  

"The interim government seems, nevertheless, to be operating, at least in some parts of Rwanda, as the de facto authority.  As such it can, in our opinion, legally be contacted and dealt with by the United Nations in the same manner as other potential contributors to the peace process in Rwanda."

Now, getting back to my question, wouldn't you agree that the chief legal officer of the United Nations concluded that the Arusha Accords were not applicable to the succession of President Habyarimana on the 6th of April 1994?
A.	It is my understanding that the secretary general for legal affairs expressed this opinion on the 25th of May has properly interpreted the law.  I have also reminded you here that, if the United Nations were to delve into seeking the legality of matters in all member states, we would be in a situations where we cannot solve all the government -- all the problems.  

That is why governments in power are considered as de facto governments with which the United Nations deals, and these are governments that control tens of millions of people in several cases.  So I do not see what stands in contradiction to what I have said from the passage you have read.

What I said was that at that time Rwanda was in a very peculiar -- should I say special -- situation because two legal instruments, both having constitutional value, were in force in that country.  That is why I said also that Rwandans of good faith, intelligent Rwandans of good faith, would have been able to find some balance between those two instruments that would have moved them towards a position of legal consensus.

That was what I said.  I did not say that the Arusha Accords were to be implemented promptly.  Because in fact, what we were dealing with at the time was more of a political situation than a legal situation to the extent that what was absolutely needed was agreement between the stakeholders in order for the law to enjoy any manner of furtherance under those circumstances.

That is why the assistant secretary general in charge of legal affairs was fully aware of that situation when he drafted his letter in view of the legal opinion that was sought.  You must remember that this morning I told you that the representative of the interim government was requested to vacate his seat at the United Nations independent of and despite the legal opinion that had been said -- that had been sought and which was already obsolete, so to speak.

That is what I meant.  The legal opinion came at a point in time which reflected the reality as at that time.  And that is what I referred to this morning when I said that the United Nations deals with the government in place.  But shortly thereafter, things changed.  When the United Nations did no longer recognise the government in Gitarama, the United Nations withdrew their representative -- the Rwandan representative at the Security Council.

So, Mr. Robinson, you cannot tell me that all these things did not have legal and political consequences.  I have told you also that, under these types of circumstances, politics takes the upper hand over and above the law.  At the UN Security Council it must be said that the Security Council is primarily a political institution and problems are solved from that perspective.

So I don't know what you want to do with this document you have placed before me.  Do you want me to say that the legal advisor was right or was wrong?  Well, now you make of me a judge in this courtroom, a judge on issues that should be sorted out by my superiors.  

You're asking me for an opinion.  I don't have any opinion on this document different from what I said a short while ago, that it was possible for a legal government to have been crafted if the constraints of consensus were taken into consideration, and I know that is not an easy task.  
(Pages 40 to 46 by Kelly Surina)































1500H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So can we agree that, when you agreed with Mr. Webster that it was an illegal government, you were using the word "illegal" in a political sense rather than having interpreted the applicable provisions of the law? 
A.	This letter that I have before me, I did not -- I had not even received it, because the letter states that Mr. Iqbal Riza, assistant secretary general for peacekeeping operations, and the letter is to 
Ralph Zachlin, assistant secretary general of the UN for legal affairs.  

Now, as you can see yourself, this document was not copied to UNAMIR.  So we at UNAMIR acted on the basis of generally accepted United Nations principles, namely, that we do not get so involved in the definition or qualification of governments but that we deal with them because they are there and they are in control of the country.  

So that is why I could talk about such a government being illegal because, legality flows from the constitution and from the laws, and this government was not set up pursuant to the law because of a number of problems that you are aware of and that we all are aware of, namely, the crisis that was obtaining at the time.  

I, therefore, do not know how referring to this government as an illegal government or, should I say, a criminal government can have any bearing on the judgement that will be handed down by this Tribunal, by this Court.  I do not know.  Am I supposed to use some terminology that pleases you or that would satisfy the Prosecutor who examined me till this morning?  

So I don't know what the fundamental issue you are looking for is, that matter that you seek to clarify or that you wish the witness to clarify.  I don't know what it is. 
Q.	No.  I think you have clarified the context in which you have used the term "illegal", and that is very helpful, and I thank you for that.  

Now, I want to just ask you some questions about events that took place after the 6th of April.  Were you aware that Mr. Nzirorera had sent members of the national Interahamwe committee around to the roadblocks to try to get them to stop the killing? 
A.	I don't know.  Unfortunately, if I had known, I would have encouraged it along those lines, given that all those who wanted peace wanted that all the roads be opened up and that people be able to go back to their homes and that an end be put to the violence and the killings.  I think that all peace-loving Rwandans wanted just that, and the foreigners who supported them all wanted restoration of peace, a return to normal activities in the interests of peace and in the interests of individuals.  
But, as you know, in the period of crisis, as what we were witnessing, information is difficult to be circulated. 
Q.	And were you aware that Mr. Nzirorera and the MRND leaders had made multiple communiqués on the radio urging people to stop the killing?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry, the substance of the question is interesting, but the way that it's being put to the witness is inappropriate.  So perhaps Mr. Robinson could find another way of raising these issues.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I think Mr. Webster is going to have to be a little bit more specific with his objection of inappropriate because I'm not catching the drift of what's inappropriate about that.  
MR. WEBSTER:
The question is leading.  It's obviously leading.  And this is a witness called by the Defence.  He shouldn't be cross-examined.  Information shouldn't be fed to him through the question.  So that's my objection, to the form.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I think it's quite obvious.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Booh-Booh, I want to just read very briefly from some documents that are already admitted into evidence, reports by UNAMIR, by the UN, and even some by yourself after the 6th of April.  

On the 7th of April, Kofi Annan reported to the Secretary General that the special representative in Rwanda and the force commander had reported that there was no authority in control at this moment in Kigali.  That's Exhibit D. NZ34.

On the 9th of April, Kofi Annan reported to the Secretary General that the interim government did not appear to have any authority, and that's D. NZ37.  

On the 18th of April -- no, excuse me.  On the 14th of April, UNAMIR sent an assessment that the interim government was unable to control the behaviour of the soldiers, the Interahamwe or the population.  That's D. NZ230.  

On the 18th of April, you reported to the Secretary General that there was currently a vacuum in the political leadership of the country, and you noted that, "What is equally baffling is the complete disappearance of the leaders of the political parties, and presumably they too have left the city or are hiding in the city."  And that's D. NZ232.  
On the 19th of April, UNAMIR reported that the government is yet to be in full control of the situation.  

On the 24th of April, UNAMIR reported that Dallaire had met with the prime minister, and he said they were unable to control the militia.  

On the 29th of April -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
At this point I'm going to interrupt the form of the question.  I'm not trying to prevent Mr. Robinson from making legitimate enquiry, but at this point it's a bit out of hand.  All these exhibits are multiple pages long.  It's unfair to the trial record to take snippets and put it to the witness in this form.  

Now, I understand the proposition he's putting to the witness.  Could he not just say that and let's have a response from the witness?  And reading snippets of exhibits, which then opens the door for me to go back to all of these exhibits and pull out the information that is favourable to the Prosecution characterisation of the evidence -- let the witness hear the proposition and give a response.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, if I were to put each of these documents in front of the witness, we would be here until Monday.  But I think I could try to summarise, and I will state for the record the exhibits that I am referring to -- and I could summarise for the witness in one question, which is what I was trying to do to save time.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	But from all these exhibits, including D. NZ413, 417, 238 and 423, in communications going all the way up to the 18th of May, UNAMIR and yourself consistently reported on the lack of control over those who were perpetrating the killing; isn't that correct?  
A.	In fact, we informed New York about the possible absence of authority in Rwanda, the virtual absence of an authority capable of bringing the situation under control, capable of protecting the population.  And I believe that, from all the documents which you read, I recognised them, that was (inaudible) to make it known that the situation had spun out of all control.  

War was ongoing, and if the interim government was described in those terms and was withdrawing each day to Gitarama and then we were told that they were in Kibuye and then virtually most of the members of this government were out of the country, we had to report this situation to the 
Secretary General at headquarters in New York.  

And so my answer is yes, we reported to New York, as is put in vulgar terms in my country, gap power was in the streets, and that power control had gone out of hand.  We made it clear.  We said it.  I did not know whether the facts went counter to our reports sent to New York. 
Q.	Mr. Booh-Booh, Mr. Nzirorera contends that he knew of no plan to exterminate Tutsis and had no control over those who perpetrated the massacres.  

As the highest official of the United Nations in Rwanda, do you have any reason to doubt that? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I am objecting to the question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We uphold the objection.  We think it calls for speculation.  We don't know how the witness could be expected to know that. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

I have no further questions.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This morning there was an indication that the other counsel may not have had any further questions.  I presume the position remains the same.  Okay.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, with your permission, I have one or two questions that I would like to follow up on it.  It will be very brief. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
On what subject?  
MR. WEBSTER:
It's on the approach to the CND on the 5th of January.
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I think if any such question -- he's already covered the 5th of January, but if any such questions are to be put, they should be put to you.  You can then decide whether you wish to put them to the witness.  That's how we've proceeded before when we had some extra requests.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.  I think that's the procedure we follow.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't recall that being the general procedure, Your Honour, but I have no qualms about putting a question to the Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Questions put through us.  We may or may not -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, let me just raise the issue.  The information that we have is that the RPF was -- that deputies for the RPF that were anticipated to take the oath of office on the 5th of January resided in a hotel that was on the complex of the CND.  It's called the Hotel, in Kinyarwanda, Amajyambere, A-M-A-J-Y-A-M-B-E-R-E, or, in translation, the hôtel de developpement, Hotel of Development.  

I would like to know from the witness whether he was aware that those deputies had to exit the compound through one exit and re-enter the parliament building with everybody else in order to gain access on the afternoon of the 5th of January.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I would object to that question being put.  First of all, the point of the question is whether they would have to travel by vehicle to the CND, so whether they have to go out one door and come in another doesn't have any relevance to the proposition which is that they are not going to be stopped by Interahamwe or anybody else while they're going from one place to another.  So whether they were in a hotel next door or in the same building to me makes no difference.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, Mr. Robinson, we think the witness should explain that.  That's evidence you are giving.  
THE WITNESS:
I must confess, Mr. President -- I must avow that in my mind I -- people always talk to me of members of parliament and ministers of the RPF who were at CND, that is, in the building which played host to the Rwandan parliament.  

It is now that I'm learning that there was Hotel Amajyambere where these members of parliament and maybe ministers were.  I was not aware.  

But I must tell you that it was agreed that members of parliament as well as ministers of RPF were not to leave where they were lodged.  And I have always thought that they were at the CNR (sic) 
with -- under UNAMIR escort, because UNAMIR had put escorts at the disposal of these ministers and members of parliament.  And about that I was regularly informed, and I never heard any major complaints about that.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And I have another follow-up question.  In his book Mr. Booh-Booh recounts the incidents of the 
5th of January -- it's on page 5 in the English translation and page 77 in the original French text.  And we have reviewed that information during my cross-examination.  And my recollection of his responses to my questions, which can be found on the draft transcripts at pages 23 and 24, is that he was quite clear and authoritative in saying that Interahamwe and soldiers prevented deputies from returning to the CND to take the oath of office that afternoon.  

Yet he gave a contradictory account to Mr. Robinson during his redirect.  And I'd like to know from the witness, where does the truth lie? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, this is really improper to be now going back to a same issue that was covered before.  If it was something new that had come up in the redirect examination, perhaps it could be recross, but he is basically wanting to have another shot at the same topic, and I don't think that's proper.  Otherwise, we can go on forever. 
MR. WEBSTER:
My concern, Your Honours, is that the record of this witness's response be clear.  Mr. Robinson went into this issue.  He introduced three additional exhibits to address this issue of whether the deputies abandoned the swearing-in or whether they were prevented from taking the oath of office.  And the witness gave one set of answers on direct, another set of answers on cross, and then went and contradicted those answers in the redirect.  

And I cannot force the witness to give an answer that pleases me, but I think the Court can ask him to be clear about what he means.  So the witness should be given his final -- all of his responses are on the record.  Let him clarify it for us, because you cannot reconcile the two sets of responses.  Either they were Interahamwe and soldiers that prevented the deputies from arriving, or they weren't. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We understand your observation, Mr. Webster.  

Yes.  We consider that there has been significant conflict on this issue, and the witness should be given an opportunity to clarify the position.  

Witness, did you understand the issue?  Do you wish to make a comment for clarification?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, thank you.  I do not see where the contradiction arises from with regard to my statement.  

What I said was, in the morning, when the president took oath of office, there were a few problems concerning the entrance of some high-ranking officials.  I was informed about the fact that some candidates, ministers or members of parliament who had run into some difficulties in the entrance of the CND, which was the place of the ceremonies.  But, of course, that problem was solved.  

In the afternoon I told you that, to the best of my knowledge, no incidents were reported to me for the good reason that in the meantime the president of the republic had met the prime minister, and they did not come to an agreement between themselves, and the ceremony that was supposed to take place in the afternoon was virtually cancelled.  Some parties told the militants not to come to the ceremony that was supposed to take place in the afternoon.  

And so I do not see where one can mention any other incidents in the afternoon when the ceremony was difficult to hold and when the ceremony was virtually cancelled.  If there were problems, I was not informed about the said problems.  

And after everything, I wasn't a security agent going up and down trying to ensure security here and there or holding checkpoints here and there.  I'm saying that -- I'm only saying what my collaborators, whom I trusted, what they told me.  I am trusting the reports which they submitted to me.  And in the afternoon no problem was reported to me for the simple reason that the situation in the morning had changed.  

The president successfully took the oath of office in the morning because everybody was agreed.  There was a consensus to that effect.  

Contrarily, in the afternoon everybody was not agreed.  There was no consensus as to that which was supposed to happen.  And so some parties, purely and simply, called upon their militants, future ministers, (inaudible), members of parliament not to go to the ceremonial grounds at the CND.  

Now, I don't see where there is any contradiction in this.  Maybe some people want me to say that in the afternoon there were fights, there were struggles, there were -- some people received blows and -- no.  I was not reported that.  So, Mr. President, kindly take down what I just said in the transcript of this session.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I have nothing further.  I think the record will speak for itself.  

I will offer in evidence the entirety of Mr. Booh-Booh's book and his statement to Filip Reyntjens and the communiqué from Joseph Nzirorera of the 10th of January 1994, and that would conclude my examination.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any controversy on the exhibits?  
MR. ROBINSON:
No, Mr. President.  They can be admitted 

Mr. President, may Mr. Booh-Booh, if he is willing, be permitted to greet the Accused before he leaves.  And I would also like to express my own appreciation to him for coming here and giving his testimony, which I think is historic.  Thank you.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I wish to remind the Trial Chamber that requests for admission of an exhibit which 
Mr. Issa showed me should be NG94, and I think that the Trial Chamber should kindly admit this document in evidence.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I hope you have gotten results of the various indications which you carried from 
Mr. Webster and that you also accept to admit the exhibits that I submitted yesterday and which I presented to the witness on which I examined the witness on accord, which Mr. Issa would kindly submit to us.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, I did look into the matter of whether the exhibit from Mr. Weyl had been previously admitted, and it has not, so that should be given a number.  

As for Madam Diagne's document, I have no objection to it being admitted and being given a 
D. K number.  But the entire book will go into evidence as a Prosecution exhibit.  It would simply duplicate what she is offering, which is just two pages.  But I have no opposition if she wants those two pages highlighted in a separate exhibit.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We grant all the applications for admission, and the registry will give exhibit numbers, please.  
 MR. MJUI:
	Thank you, Your Honour.  For Karemera document, it would be D. K139.
(Exhibit No. D. K139 admitted)
MR. MJUI:
For Ngirumpatse document, it will be D. NG94.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
(Exhibit No. D. NG94 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecution. 
MR. MJUI:
	Prosecution, the book will be P. 432.  
(Exhibit No. P. 432 admitted)
MR. WEBSTER:
And the answers to Professor Reyntjens from a letter and document of July 1995, that needs a number as well.  P. 433?
MR. MJUI:
Yes, Your Honour.  
	(Exhibit No. P. 433 admitted)

MR. WEBSTER:
And the communiqué from Joseph Nzirorera of the 10th of January 1994 would be 434.  
	(Exhibit No. P. 434 admitted)
MR. WEBSTER:
	And then the only issue remaining is re-scanning Exhibit P. 49, which was missing three pages in what we have and -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't need to deal with that now in the presence of this witness.  

Mr. Booh-Booh, we thank you for coming to testify, as we do all witnesses who come to the Tribunal which assists us in the work that we have to do.  Your testimony is now completed and you are excused.  

The request made will be granted, and the registry will make appropriate arrangements.  

Mr. Robinson, tomorrow morning what are we going to be doing?  
MR. ROBINSON:
We are going to resume the direct examination of François Karera.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  

So we take our adjournment now until tomorrow morning.  
(Court adjourned at 1530H)
