P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.  As we now commence -- recommence the case, I would ask kindly the registrar to open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar -- thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session, today, Monday the 7th of April 2008, for the resumption of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Registrar.  

Now could we have our proceedings for the -- our entry of appearance?  And I am afraid this has to be done again, and this is for the trial session.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, excuse me, Mr. President.  Since we are now commencing with the Defence case, I think we can enter our appearance first so that we can maintain some equity in these proceedings.  So I am happy to introduce myself as Peter Robinson, lead counsel for Joseph Nzirorera.  Mr. Nzirorera is here seated to my left.  Also seated to my left is our legal assistant, Leopold Nsengiyumva, and we are also assisted at this time in Brussels by co-counsel, Patrick Nimy.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Good afternoon, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I am Dior Diagne, lead counsel for 
Mr. Édouard Karemera.  I am assisted by the president of the Senegal Bar Council, Mr. Félix Sow, as well as Madam Fatou Ndour, legal assistant.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam -- Maitre Diagne.
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Good afternoon, Mr. President.  Good afternoon to everybody.  I am Chantal Hounkpatin, counsel for Mr. Ngirumpatse, who is next to me, and I am assisted by Mr. Frédéric Weyl, and our assistant, 
Madam Marina Yetongnon.  There is a second assistant opposite you, Emmanuel Pire, who is an intern and who will be sworn in shortly. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
MR. WEBSTER:  
Since I have been corrected and Mr. Robinson has started his Defence case first, I would hope that by 5:30 this afternoon I have a full list of his witnesses with descriptions, which was this Chamber's order from last week and re-arranged earlier this morning.

Having said that, let me introduce the Prosecution team:  Don Webster, as the team leader, along with Alayne Frankson-Wallace, Iain Morley, Saidou N'dow, Gerda Visser.  The latter two are not here presently, but they are part of the appearance which began this morning -- and the latter one, rather.  And our intern, Anthony Diala, who is seated at the back with us as well; and Takeh Sendze, 
Sunkarie Ballah-Conteh is not here, but she is part of the team as well; and Deo Mbuto.  So thank you.  

We are ready to begin and I hope we will really be ready tomorrow morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Webster.  

Mr. Registrar, are the connections in place?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Yes, Mr. President, everything is in order.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, the registrar has informed me that the connections are in place, and I presume that I can now allow you to formally call in your witness. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  At this time the Nzirorera Defence will call 
Witness Jean-Baptiste Butera. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Mr. Butera.  

Can you hear me?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can hear you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
As you are aware, you are about to give testimony before the Tribunal as a witness for 
Joseph Nzirorera.  As a necessary preliminary step, the registrar will have to administer an oath to you to tell the truth, and I would ask you to stand so that that process can take place now. 

I am sorry; I can -- I think that in the -- the visible effort that is being made to get him to his feet is of such a nature that I can direct that he may take the oath in the sitting position. 

You may sit, please. 
MR. TCHIDIMBO:
Mr. President, with your leave, I would like to administer the oath to him from The Hague, because he wasn't able to hear what was going on. 
(Declaration made by Jean-Baptiste Butera in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  I think there is a formality which I omitted.  The testimony is being given by video link, and the judicial representatives of the country in which this is taking place are supervising and monitoring the process, and I would be grateful if we could acknowledge the presence of the judicial and the registry representatives at the video location site, and I would request that you would simply identify yourself by your name and station so that it could form part of our record.
MS. BERNARDO-MENDEZ:
Mr. President, I am Berta Bernardo-Mendez.  I am an investigating magistrate.  I am assisted by Mr. Eddy Verhaute, registrar.  And also present in this room, we have the Defence representative, Mr. Nimy, who has already been mentioned, as well as the representative of the Prosecutor, by the name Mr. Nyiti. 

Mr. President, let me seize this opportunity to explain to you the state of health of the witness.  There is a doctor outside of this room who pointed out that there -- the witness can answer as long as the questions are short and clear.  

Secondly, the witness will be able to answer the questions, but extremely slowly because he has difficulty making sentences.  And for everybody to be aware, his testimony cannot last for hours.  He, himself, has said that this is a very bad time for him, and I appreciate your taking into consideration this element, because he is diabetic. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Madam Judge.  We appreciate the introductions you have given.  We thank you for that.  And we also take serious note of the information provided about the health of the witness.  
I am quite certain that counsel who will be examining him will be guided by this information. 

Mr. Robinson, I think you may proceed. 
MR. MORLEY:
May I invite Your Honour to consider a matter?  It may be that the presence of the helpful investigating magistrate is perfectly routine.  
What I would invite Your Honours to ask is whether the investigating magistrate present is, in any way, connected with any investigation into this witness in Belgium.  

I have conducted a number of video link cross-examinations in other cases and I haven't come across an investigating magistrate present in the past, and it may be that -- as I say, that the presence is perfectly routine for reasons that I am not aware of at the moment, but it may be that the investigating magistrate is present for another reason.  It is a matter for Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, we do not think we should ask that question.  
MR. MORLEY:
Yes, very well.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, you may continue. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  

And, Mr. President, at this time I will turn over the proceedings to my co-counsel, Mr. Nimy, to conduct the direct examination, which will be very brief.  Thank you. 
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Allow me, Mr. President, to respectfully greet you, as well as the other Judges in your Tribunal.  I am doing this, particularly, because I was not present during the last session, that is, the sixth session, from October to December 2007.  I was very ill, but, thank God, I am quite well now.  I would like to underscore our appreciation for your Tribunal and the care you took after I notified you about my illness, and the fact that I could not be present.  You always had a kind word after my lead counsel, 
Mr. Peter Robinson, kept you abreast of the situation of my health.  So I wanted to let you know about that, Mr. President.  

And, since you have granted me leave, I will now proceed to examine Mr. Butera.  I am now on my feet. 
JEAN-BAPTISTE BUTERA, 
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows: 
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Butera.  How do you do?  
A.	I am fine, thank you.  
Q.	Thank you.  I feel quite at ease. 

Now, Mr. Butera, I am going to read out to you the personal information sheet which I have here, and it concerns you.  Is your name Jean-Baptiste Butera? 
A.	Yes, indeed, that is my name. 
Q.	Very well.  And your date of birth, 1st of November 1943; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, indeed, that is correct. 
Q.	Very well.  You are a male? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You are of Rwandan nationality?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Very well.  And your father's name, Ngimurwango (phonetic), Michel; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
May I intervene to make an inquiry?  On the document provided to us, which is part of the routine witness disclosure, the date of birth is stated to be 11th January 1943.  Could that be clarified, please? 
MR. NIMY:
Yes, Mr. President, that date is actually on the document, and it is a typographical error.  The witness corrected that error on the document that I have with me and which I am reading out to you.  So I believe that you should consider what I am reading to you as being the authentic version of the document.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MR. NIMY:
Can I proceed? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please do. 
MR. NIMY:
Much obliged, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Your mother's name, Nyirandabarazi, Sarah; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Very well.  You are a Hutu? 
A.	Yes, indeed, I am a Hutu. 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, the registrar is pointing out to me that when I asked the question regarding the witness's mother, his microphone was not switched on, so I will repeat that question. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Butera, is your mother's name Nyirandabarazi, Sarah? 
A.	Yes, that is her name.  
Q.	Very well.  And your ethnic group -- are you a Hutu? 
A.	Yes, I am Hutu. 
Q.	You do not have any current occupation, do you? 
A.	No, because of my ill health, I stopped all activities. 
Q.	Very well.  Mr. Butera, in 1994, were you the director of political and administrative affairs at the Kigali-ville préfecture? 
A.	Yes, in 1994 I was director of political and administrative affairs. 
Q.	In which préfecture? 
A.	Kigali-ville préfecture. 
Q.	Very well.  Place of birth, is it Nyundo in Cyabingo commune in Ruhengeri préfecture?
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Very well.  And your residence in 1994, was it, indeed, the préfecture of Kigali-ville? 
A.	Yes, it was indeed that very préfecture.  
Q.	And you currently reside in Brussels, in Belgium, do you not? 
A.	Yes.
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, in view of the affirmative responses provided by the witness confirming what is written in the personal identification sheet before me that I have just read out to you, I would now like to tender this personal identification sheet into evidence as marked, D. NZ435 -- D. NZ435. 
MR. MJUI:
Yes, Your Honour.  The document will be D. NZ435.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ435 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  Before we continue, I am noticing that the witness is not -- his facial features are not able to be seen on this video because it's too dark, and I think, since demeanour is an important aspect of your evaluation of credibility, it would be impossible really for you to judge that demeanour under the current conditions.  So I would ask that the technicians try to make Mr. Butera's face visible so that we could clearly see him during the substance of his testimony. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we have noticed some improvement already; have you? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, I have.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MR. ROBINSON:
It is much better. 
MR. TCHIDIMBO:
Mr. President, with your leave, it is in fact the registrar present here in Brussels.  We would like to request of the technicians that they do the necessary so that we no longer hear an echo at our end, because whenever we speak we hear the echoes of our voices and, of course, this has an impact on the quality of the sound produced. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's certain.  

Mr. Registrar, could you assist, please?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Mr. President, the necessary -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We do not have any English translation. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
The technicians here, they have confirmed that they will.  Thank you. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, message from the English booth.  The registrar in Brussels just said that he didn't have any English translation. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, could you investigate and let me know what that is about?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Mr. President, I need to talk to the technicians and they are coming.  Thank you.  

Mr. President, I am informed that the problem is from the satellite room, second floor, here in the Kilimanjaro building, but it is being rectified.  They have been informed.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hometowu. 

I would suggest that we try and proceed now.  If there are any further difficulties, we could be informed at that time.  

Counsel, Mr. Nimy. 
MR. NIMY:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And I would suggest that you proceed now.  The information has been communicated to the relevant officers, and we will act on the premise that the problem is being rectified, unless we have a further complaint. 
MR. NIMY:
Obliged, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Butera, in the year 1994, were you working at Kigali-ville préfecture? 
A.	I am sorry. 
Q.	In the year 1994, were you working for the préfecture of Kigali-ville? 
A.	Yes.  In the year 1994, I was indeed working for the préfecture of Kigali-ville. 
Q.	Thank you.  And, as borne witness to by your personal information sheet, you worked there as the director of political and administrative affairs, that is to say, for the préfecture of Kigali-ville, did you not?
A.	Yes.  
Q.	I am now going to show to you a statement which I have before me, but, before doing so I would like to ask whether there were any meetings held at Kigali-ville préfecture? 
A.	You are asking me whether there were any meetings convened within Kigali-ville préfecture.  There were meetings.  There were meetings. 
Q.	So there were meetings? 
A.	Yes, there were meetings.  
Q.	Were there any meetings that you attended? 
A.	Meetings I might have attended? 
Q.	Yes. 
A.	Yes, there were meetings that I attended, but as this was many years ago now since the year 1994, that is, I no longer recall the meetings that I attended. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  I shall now refresh your memory and I shall show to you the statement -- 
MR. MORLEY:
Can we stop for a moment?  With Your Honours' leave, if I may address Your Honour.  I may be confused about the rules of evidence, but it may be Your Honours agree that, when conducting examination-in-chief, the order of the exercise is not to put in front of the witness statements, previous statements, and such things.  It is to examine his recollection of events.  And what Your Honours will be assisted by is, his giving his evidence as a consequence of questions and not his offering a statement, if that is what is about to happen.  That is certainly not the way that I have ever seen direct examination conducted before.  But as Your Honour knows, I am often corrected, and I would invite Your Honours' attention as to whether this is a proper procedure. 
MR. NIMY:
May we offer a response, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I am quite simply laying the foundations which will enable me to put specific questions 
to the witness.  I cannot put specific questions to him on the subject of meetings if we do not lay the foundations for those meetings, if we do not broach the subject of the said meetings.  And the statements I have just mentioned are quite simply one of the elements or one of the pieces of evidence which might come in support of the factual affirmations to be provided by the witness.  And this is why 
I am putting questions to him in a preliminary manner. 

So Mr. President, with your leave, I shall continue. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please, wait one moment. 

Yes, I am sorry for that brief delay, but we had to replace the receiver for one member of our panel.  

Counsel, our ruling on what has just transpired is that you are entitled to ask questions to lay the foundations that you need.  But you are not permitted to show to the witness the statement that he made before coming into the witness box to refresh his memory.  So you have to ask him the questions and rely on his ability to recall what happened in relation to what he is going to testify about.  

You may proceed. 
MR. NIMY:
Much obliged, Mr. President.
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Butera, during the period of April 1994, did you attend any -- that is to say, one, two or three or a number of different meetings held at the préfecture of Kigali-ville? 
A.	Yes.  During the period of 1994, yes, there were meetings that I attended. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And the meetings you attended were chaired by whom? 
A.	Those meetings were chaired by the préfet of Kigali, that is to say, Mr. Renzaho - 
	Mr. Renzaho, Juvénal. 
MR. MORLEY:
May I interrupt briefly?  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  I am sorry to interrupt again.  I am conscious of being on my feet three times.  May I ask what the witness is reading from?  He has a notebook in front of him, and it may be that he is using that to refresh his memory, I don't know.  I don't know what's on the notebook, is that an aide mémoire of some sort?  It may be that it's of interest to Your Honours.  Please.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Could the witness be asked what is on the notebook that he is using in giving his testimony?  
MR. TCHIDIMBO:
Mr. President, this is the courtroom officer.  The witness is taking down personal notes.  He is taking notes with a view to be able -- being able to better express himself in response to the questions.  This is, in fact, a notebook that I gave to him at the outset of the examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Counsel, you may proceed with your questions. 
MR. NIMY:
I thank you, Mr. President.

I note that this might have gone without saying for Mr. Morley, that he might have realised that, in view of the state of the witness and his difficulties in articulating, it was necessary for him to take notes in order not to lose track of what he is saying during his responses.  So I should continue, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Butera, these meetings that you said were chaired by the préfet -- Préfet Renzaho, that is.  Can you confirm that fact? 
A.	Yes, I can confirm that fact, because he was the person who was in charge.  So he was the person who was able to convene meetings and to chair meetings. 
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Butera.  

Now, to the best of your recollection, who -- with the exception of yourself, that is -- who was in attendance at these meetings?   Apart from yourself, that is, who else took part in these meetings? 
A.	Let us say that those people who were in attendance at those meetings -- well, I must say that for the time being I cannot recall because this was a very long time ago now. 
Q.	Very well.  Mr. Butera, do you know Mr. Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	Yes.  I knew Mr. Joseph Nzirorera very well because we lived in the same commune.  
Q.	Very well.  So Mr. Joseph Nzirorera: were you to lay eyes on him, you would not be able to -- be able to recognise him? 
A.	No. 
Q.	You will not be mistaken as to his identity?  You could not confuse him with an identical-looking person in the streets of Kigali, for example? 
A.	No.  Were I to meet him, I would recognise him because we know each other. 
Q.	Very well.  So Mr. Butera, I would like to put this fundamental question to you: during these various and numerous meetings during the month of April 1994, did you see Mr. Nzirorera in attendance at those meetings or at that meeting, if there was any one? 
A.	No.  Quite sincerely, I must say that I did not see Nzirorera take part in any of those meetings. 
Q.	So you did not see Mr. Nzirorera take part in any of those meetings, can you confirm that fact? 
A.	Yes, I can confirm that fact. 
Q.	So you did not see Mr. Nzirorera -- well, did you see him chair any of those meetings?
A.	No, I neither saw him in attendance at any of those meetings nor did I see him chair any of those meetings.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I can conclude, therefore, from your testimony that during the period of April 1994 meetings were held at Kigali-ville préfecture, meetings chaired by the préfet, Tharcisse Renzaho, and you, yourself, were in attendance at those meetings and that Mr. Nzirorera was not present? 
A.	To be quite honest, Mr. Nzirorera was not in attendance at those meetings chaired by the préfet.  He was not.  
Q.	Very well, Witness.  I thank you.  
MR. NIMY:
And, Mr. President, I would really like to pay homage to the courage shown by the witness with reference to his will to participate for justice to be done in this case.  It is not easy for somebody who himself has health issues to accept to come to testify before your Tribunal in order to shed his part of light for justice to be done. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
MR. NIMY:
As -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 

Mr. Witness, thank you for giving your testimony in-chief.  But I am sure that you are familiar with the practice in these Tribunals that you will now be required to respond to some questions put to you by the Prosecutor.  And I will now ask the Prosecutor to examine you. 
MR. MORLEY:
Might it be that, in the usual course of events, any cross-examination by my learned friends co-defending comes first, and my cross-examination last?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  I should have asked. 

Is there any cross-examination from any of the co-defendants? 

I think the lack of response is an answer which I accept.  

There being no cross-examination, you may proceed, Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  With the assistance of the registry staff, I have some documents to distribute.  May I say at this stage, having heard the evidence in-chief, it may be that I will not be using any of them.  But I think at this point I should distribute them firstly to the registry, Mr. Hometowu; one for the members of the Bench; one for each of the Defence teams; and then one of each of the translation booths, please.  

As Your Honours know, a practice has developed where, at the moment cross-examination begins, any documents which might be used get distributed.  But I mention that it may be that I don't use very many of these at all.  We will see how we go.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you hear me? 
A.	Yes, I can hear you.  
Q.	And can you see me on the screen? 
A.	Yes, it is somewhere to the side, but I can see you. 
Q.	Just so that you understand, the reason I look away, if you see me looking away on the screen, is I am then looking at you on my television monitor -- so that you understand, therefore, why I am not looking directly at you as, indeed, you are looking directly at the Court.  Do you understand what I have said? 
A.	Yes, I do understand you. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  In just reviewing very quickly the material that has been distributed, I see some problems with -- particularly with the lack of disclosure, which should be in violation of one of the rules of procedure.  And I would like to ask that we recess the video link very briefly in -- at its location, that those people take a break and we discuss what appears to me to be another violation of the Prosecutor's responsibilities under Rule 66(B).  And they had a very little time to look at this, maybe 
I am mistaken.  But I think we -- before the Prosecutor could be allowed to proceed, that would have to be cleared up.  So I would ask that you allow the people in Brussels to take a brief recess while we determine whether there has been a violation of the disclosure requirements.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have to accept your request to have the matter clarified, Mr. Robinson, and I don't think it is likely to be very long.  And I would suggest that we take at this time -- that we take a ten-minute recess from the video link so that we will allow the -- it's now six minutes past three, and we will reconnect with the link at 16 minutes past three. 

Mr. Morley, is it so -- or do you need Mr. Robinson to identify the documents which he refers?  
MR. MORLEY:
I imagine Mr. Robinson would like to have a moment to look through the material, and I anticipate that once he has seen the material he would be able to better marshal his arguments.  The bundle is paginated so that he will be able to take Your Honours to the various pages he is concerned about.  But I anticipate -- well, I can't speak for him -- that he might be inviting Your Honours to allow him ten minutes just to look through the material.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, what caught my attention immediately -- and I haven't had a good chance to look through the material; my client hasn't seen it yet -- but immediately caught my attention from pages 177 onward, what appears to be immigration records from the Belgian authorities.  And if that's the case, there has been a gross violation of Rule 66(B), as well as direct misrepresentations by the Prosecution concerning what is being disclosed.  So maybe I am mistaken about the nature of the documents, but -- 
MR. MORLEY:
Can I answer straight away the immigration records?  As I understand it, those were disclosed by email on Saturday.  We only got the mail on Friday and Saturday.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I never received any such disclosure and perhaps -- I don't know if my colleagues did.  They are also indicating they never received such disclosure either.  So we are seeing those records for the first time.  And, in addition -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, the Bench -- we think that we have seen -- we saw them on the weekend, but we are trying to ascertain now from -- how you received them. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  I didn't receive them.  So -- 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, perhaps this is the time to say out aloud that we also did not receive these materials and, worse still, we made an official appeal concerning witnesses in general.

MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, perhaps -- 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I would like to conclude.  Mr. President, beyond this specific case, we submitted an application on the 31st of March, and we thought at that time that the Prosecutor could continue to ambush us, and that is why we asked that they should disclose. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The file that was copied to us has an indication that one Gerda Visser sent this material, and we noticed the names of Defence counsel on the mailing list.  This was forwarded to us by our trial coordinator.  The date suggests that Gerda Visser's mail was received by our coordinator on the 5th of April at 16:26, and it was forwarded to us on the 6th of April at 1:15 p.m.  So are you sure it has not been received?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
No.  I am positive it has not been received, Mr. President, but I will note that over the weekend some emails that I sent to UN addresses were bounced back to me, and it is possible that this material didn't make it out of the UN server, because my material that I was trying to send to people at the UN server was coming back to me.  So it is possible that it was sent and never received.  It seems to be that.  I am positive I didn't receive it.  So it seems to be that may be one explanation for that.

MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I had not concluded.  The email that I sent on the 6th of April specifically to WVSS, as I pointed out this morning, was indeed received at WVSS.  On the other hand, I did not receive any materials from the Prosecutor, so I cannot put the Tribunal's server at fault.  Even if my name figures among those to whom that document was sent, I did not receive any.  I also sent a petition, a motion, requesting that the Prosecution should disclose to us any materials concerning our witnesses, but so far we have received nothing, and I think it is the time to point this out.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, just like my learned colleagues, I would like to confirm that we did not receive anything either.   
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, it seems clear that the material was disclosed by the Prosecution and not received, and under those circumstances had we received them I think certainly we would have gone over them with the witness prior to his taking the oath.  So my next question would be whether or not Mr. Morley intends to use these documents during his cross-examination.  If he doesn't, we don't have any problem.  If he does, we will seek some other remedy.  
MR. MORLEY:
Probably not, but that isn't a satisfactory answer.  I'm mindful of the examination-in-chief so far, and the material which appears towards the end of the bundle, which I can assist Your Honours, consists of an interview conducted in, I think, 1998 or maybe 1994 -- I'm working from memory -- and a decision at one point to refuse asylum and then there was a decision later to grant, I think, Belgian nationality.  And there is a letter from 2007 which refers to this witness.  The material to look at doesn't take very long.  Whether I use it or not, at the moment I cannot be certain.  But I can say that as I'm about to embark on this cross-examination, I probably won't have to use it given what I've heard from the witness so far.  It may be that we should simply start and see where we get to.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, I agree with that.  And I think if Mr. Morley intends to go into any of the subjects of these documents, I would ask that he notify the Court before commencing that and we can take up the problem at that time.  But as far as I'm concerned, we should go ahead with his cross-examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We will adopt that course.  It's now 3:18, and could we reconnect with our video link and allow Mr. Robinson to continue -- Mr. Morley to continue his cross-examination. 

Mr. Webster, I just had a brief discussion with Mr. Hometowu, and he told me that the -- that his office is ready to facilitate the electronic service matters of this nature, and it may very well be that it may be a good practice to send the material to him to allow him onward service.  
MR. WEBSTER:
We'd be happy to meet with Mr. Hometowu and to work it out in the future, Your Honour.  What we've done in the past is send it to CMS electronically.  I think it appears that the mailboxes outside the 
UN system did not receive the communication Mr. Hometowu did, or I assume he did, but we will work out the details of that with him when the session concludes.  I think, just for the record, I had indicated to Mr. Robinson sometime last week that we did not have immigration records at that time and that as soon as they were received, we'd transmit them and that's what happened over the weekend.  I think this was sent out on Saturday afternoon.  So I recognise the problem.  Parenthetically, there are another few emails that I had sent that came back to me that I resent, so clearly there must have been a problem with the server.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you hear me?  Yes? 
A.	Yes, I can hear you.
Q.	There is an investigating magistrate present with you in your room.  May I ask, are you presently under an investigation in Belgium? 
A.	Could you kindly repeat the question?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It seems that the witness did not quite understand.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Are you being investigated in Belgium for crimes in Rwanda? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Have you ever been the subject of investigation in Belgium for crimes in Rwanda? 
A.	No, I never was.
Q.	Why is the investigating magistrate present?
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, Mr. Morley, I don't think that's a fair question.
MS. BERNARDO-MENDEZ:
Mr. President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Magistrate, I -- we forbid the question.  
MS. BERNARDO-MENDEZ:
Much obliged.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	When you gave evidence when Mr. Nimy asked you questions, you were asked about meetings in 
April 1994, and do you recall saying, "As this was many years ago, I no longer recall the meetings I attended"?

MS. BERNARDO-MENDEZ:
Could you repeat the question and please, if possible, try to ask very brief questions so that the witness could understand easily?
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Do you recall saying that the préfet of Kigali was Juvénal Renzaho? 
A.	Yes, I did say that.
Q.	But it's not Juvénal Renzaho who's the préfet of Kigali.  Or was, it's Tharcisse Renzaho.  You made a mistake, didn't you? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It is inaudible what the witness is saying.  He said the last part was he was the one who was the préfet of Kigali town.  The first part was totally inaudible.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Juvénal Renzaho was an advisor to President Habyarimana, killed in the plane crash on 6 April 1994.  Do you remember? 
A.	Yes, there was one Renzaho who perished alongside the president in the accident.
Q.	In 1994 it's right, is it not, that you were the sous-préfet in Kigali-ville? 
A.	At that time I was referred to as the sous-préfet of Kigali-ville, but in truth it's that I was a director.  I was the director of political, administrative and legal affairs.
Q.	Your immediate superior was the préfet.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, Préfet Renzaho.
Q.	And you worked closely with him for a number of years.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes.  Yes.
Q.	You've told us you think the préfet's name was Juvénal, haven't you? 
A.	Juvénal Renzaho.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	But his name was Tharcisse Renzaho.  Do you remember now? 
A.	I'm sorry.  I did not quite grasp -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness does not finish his sentence.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	The préfet's name was not Juvénal.  It was Tharcisse.  Do you remember now? 
A.	I can't recall Tharcisse Renzaho.  Renzaho, yes, but Tharcisse?  The name Tharcisse I cannot recall.
Q.	Do you also remember that when giving evidence when Mr. Nimy asked you questions about meetings in April of 1994 you said, "Those in attendance I must say I cannot recall.  It was a long time ago now"?  Do you recall saying that about half an hour ago? 
A.	Yes, that is what I answered.  Because that was a long time ago.  1994 -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness does not finish his sentence.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	You were a member of the MRND on the same préfectoral committee as Joseph Nzirorera in Ruhengeri; is that right? 
A.	That's correct.
Q.	You were both in Cameroon together; isn't that right? 
A.	Are you asking whether I was in Cameroon with Renzaho or -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness does not finish his sentence.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, with Mr. Nzirorera, you and he were in Cameroon together.  Do you remember? 
A.	No, I was not in Cameroon with Nzirorera.
Q.	You're a friend of Nzirorera's.  Wouldn't that be fair? 
A.	Yes, because we lived together. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. 
THE WITNESS:
That is to say, in the same commune.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	And so it's clear when you say you lived together in the same commune, you mean the same commune in Rwanda; isn't that right? 
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Do you remember being in Cameroon? 
A.	You're asking whether I remember -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness does not finish his sentence.  
MR. MORLEY:
For Your Honours' assistance -- I'm not sure how much more I'm going to develop at this point -- but it's document 19 in the bundle, page 91.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we have a letter which was recovered from Mr. Nzirorera addressed to him, care of you in Cameroon.  Do you remember seeing Mr. Nzirorera in Cameroon? 
A.	No, I did not see him in Cameroon.  I studied there.  However, I did not see Nzirorera.
Q.	I'm not talking about when you studied.  I'm talking about when you left Rwanda.  Do you remember you were in Cameroon in 1996?  Do you remember that? 
A.	I apologise.  I do not recall that excerpt. 
Q.	I want to be sure I understand you.  Do you not recall being in Cameroon between 1994 and 1997? 
A.	During that period I was in Cameroon.  So I was in Cameroon from 1994 to -- from 1994 to 1998.
Q.	And do you remember that in Cameroon you were the subject of an international arrest warrant?  
MR. MORLEY:
For Your Honours' assistance, page 56 of the bundle.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Do you remember that? 
A.	An international arrest warrant?
Q.	Well, do you remember you were the subject of an international arrest warrant in 1996 while you were in Cameroon?  And so was Mr. Nzirorera.  Do you remember any of this? 
A.	No, I do not remember that.
Q.	Do you remember being a co-author, with 11 other people, of a long document which suggested there had been no genocide in Rwanda?  And that document was prepared by you and others in Cameroon in 1996.  Do you remember that?
MR. MORLEY:
For Your Honours' assistance, page 130 in French and page 92 in English.  
THE WITNESS:
I do not remember.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Do you remember preparing a document in which it was said there had been no genocide with Théoneste Bagasora and Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza and Pasteur Musabe and Ferdinand Nahimana and Anatole Nsengiyumva and Augustin Ruzindana and Laurent Semanza?  Do you remember all these people?  Do you remember working with them? 
A.	Yes.  Well, the people you have just listed, I know them, but I no longer recall the contents of that document.
Q.	You know, don't you, that you're wanted in Rwanda as somebody who is believed to have been an organiser of the genocide? 
A.	Could you please repeat the question because I did not quite grasp it?   
Q.	You know, don't you, that you are wanted in Rwanda as a person suspected of being an organiser of the genocide?  You know that, don't you? 
A.	I am not aware of this document.
Q.	But there are many.  There's a document from 1994 -- 
MR. MORLEY:
Page 6 of the bundle for Your Honours; specifically page 8.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	-- in which the Rwandans say you were distributing weapons during the genocide.  Are you unaware of that? 
A.	I do not see how I can -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness does not finish his sentence.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Are you aware that in the same 1994 document, it's suggested that you and the préfet and others were responsible for a massacre at the Christus centre in Remera?  
MR. MORLEY:
For Your Honours' assistance, pages 9 and 10 of the bundle.
THE WITNESS:
With reference to Remera, I do recall because I went to visit that place, and I went to see them to see how they lived.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	In 1995 you appear again on a list prepared by the Rwandans of suspected genocidaires with, on page 12 of the bundle, your friend Nzirorera, number 2, and you on page 21, numbered 55.  Are you aware that in 1995 the Rwandans were looking for you? 
A.	Counsel, could you please repeat the question?
Q.	You told us you have no recollection of the international arrest warrant of 1996; is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is what I said.
Q.	Are you aware the Rwandans were still looking for you in 1999?  There being another report by the prosecutor general of the supreme court, page 43 of the bundle and page 44.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The investigating judge from Brussels:  
MS. BERNARDO-MENDEZ:
May I take the floor, Mr. President?
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may, yes.  
MS. BERNARDO-MENDEZ:
I believe that Mr. Butera does not quite grasp what the question is.  The questions need to be brief and precise in nature.  If we are discussing a document, the question must be put with reference to this document and the question must be laid open in such a manner.  Otherwise, the witness will not understand. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Madam Magistrate. 

Mr. Morley. 

MR. MORLEY:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Her comments are very clear?  
MR. MORLEY:
Yes, helpful.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Are you aware that in 2006 the interior ministry in Belgium were interested in whether you had an involvement in the genocide?  
MR. MORLEY:
For Your Honours' assistance, page 46 and 47.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you see, I think that's the remark made by Madam Magistrate.  Those remarks are confusing. 
MR. MORLEY:
Well, I think it will be more confusing if I have to start putting lots of documents in front of the witness.  I'm simply asking him at the moment if he is aware of the fact that he is the subject of enquiry in Rwanda, '94, '95 and '99 as a listed suspected genocidaire, and whether he is aware that the interior ministry in Belgium in 2006 was of the same enquiry.  So, if I may, without descending into the documents, because I am conscious of the fact that with this witness, having observed him, we may create greater confusion.  The way I put my question is to enquire about his awareness.  

So if I may, I will return to the question of awareness and we will see what we get to. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may proceed. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, are you aware that the Belgians were interested in whether you had participated in the genocide? 
A.	No, I'm not aware. 
Q.	Can you remember the dates of the meetings that were held in April of 1994? 
A.	As regards the dates of the meetings, I do not remember.
Q.	Did you attend every meeting that took place in April of 1994 at the préfet's office or do you not now remember?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The courtroom officer in Brussels:  

MS. BERNARDO-MENDEZ:
Could you please repeat the question?  We are under the impression here that once the question has been put to the witness, he might forget it, so we believe that his memory should be refreshed.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Did you attend every meeting at the préfet's office in April 1994 or can you not now remember? 
A.	I was in attendance at some meetings.  But as regards other meetings, well, sometimes I had a reason for being absent.
Q.	We suggest that there was a meeting at the préfet's office between the 28th and 30th of April of 1994.  Now, do you think you may not have been at that meeting? 
A.	The 31st.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Whispers the witness.  
THE WITNESS:
I do not recall, that is, concerning that meeting.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	We suggest that there was a meeting that perhaps you weren't present at at the end of April of 1994 in which Joseph Nzirorera was present.  Perhaps you missed it.  What do you think?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me. Mr. President, before the witness answers that question, I would like to interpose an objection.  Three Prosecution witnesses have testified that Mr. Butera was present at the meeting in which Mr. Nzirorera allegedly attended, so therefore I don't believe that it's fair for Mr. Morley to suggest that there was some meeting that Mr. Butera was not present at because it's inconsistent with his evidence.  Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY:
Perhaps if the witness could remove his headphones.  
MR. TCHIDIMBO:
Just one moment.  We will have to have him leave the room because he does not have any headphones.  He listens through the loud speakers. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't think what Mr. Morley has to say requires that.  
MR. MORLEY:
All right.  I'm aware of this position.  Witnesses UB, ALG and AWE have all said that there was a meeting at the end of April, Nzirorera is present, congratulating the Interahamwe, doling out money, for their murders, and they have all said that Butera was present.  There are two possibilities with regard to this evidence about his presence.  The witnesses may be right --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley, complete your cross-examination.  You can address us later.
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  So coming back to the witness, please.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we suggest there was a meeting at the end of April of 1994 in which Mr. Nzirorera was present.  Now, do you think you may have been absent and you just weren't there?  What do you 
think? 
A.	To my knowledge Nzirorera did not attend any of those meetings at the préfecture.  I did not see him at any one time.
Q.	Well, that begs the question whether you can recall what you were doing at the end of April of 1994.  We suggest there was a meeting.  Now, I'm asking you, do you think it's possible that you weren't there at that meeting and that is why you don't know about it?  
A.	The meeting on which he is insisting by saying that I did not attend it -- in any case, with regard to that meeting of the 30th of April 1994, I'm not aware of that, so as far as I'm concerned it did not take place.
Q.	Well, I suggest, sir, that you understand clearly that there was a meeting on the 30th of April.  You may now have forgotten about it or, in fact, you may be lying about it, that you were present and that 
Joseph Nzirorera congratulated the Interahamwe.  You disagree with me about that, do you?
MS. BERNARDO-MENDEZ:
Mr. President, each time I have to ask the witness whether he has understood the question. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam.  In fact, we were just ourselves considering the issue of how much more time is reasonable to carry on. 
MR. MORLEY:
I'm finished.  I'd like an answer to the question.  I think we all understood it.  I understand that the witness may genuinely be challenged understanding it because of his condition, but I don't need any more. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can try once more and see what happens and then -- 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we suggest that you were at a meeting with Nzirorera at the préfet's office at the end of April 1994.  At that meeting Nzirorera congratulated the Interahamwe for their murders, he gave them money.  We suggest that either you've forgotten about that meeting or you are not telling the truth.  But you disagree with me, do you? 
A.	I am very sorry but I'm telling you the truth.  I'm really telling the truth before you and before everybody who is with me.  And so when you say that Nzirorera attended a meeting at Kigali-ville préfecture in which I was also present, then, really, I have to tell you that this is an invention.  I'm sorry about that.  In any case, this is a fabrication.
Q.	Do you remember where you went after you left Rwanda, the order in which you travelled through countries?
MS. BERNARDO-MENDEZ:
Can you kindly repeat the question, Counsel?  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	I'm testing your memory.  Can you tell us the order in which you went through countries on leaving Rwanda? 
A.	Let me say that in 1994 I and my family took refuge -- well, I know that we went to Cameroon, and that is the only country that I remember. 
Q.	Do you not recall being in Zaire and also in Gabon before you went to Belgium? 
A.	No, I did not go to Zaire; I did not go to Gabon.
MR. MORLEY:
Well, for what it's worth and whether it gives rise to an objection from Mr. Robinson, for Your Honours' assistance, page 191 of the bundle.  

And I finish my cross-examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Now, is there going to be any redirect examination?  
MR. ROBINSON:
No, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Robinson. 

Mr. Butera, the Court would like to thank you for attending to assist it in its work by giving evidence in this case.  Your testimony is now concluded and you are excused and you may resume your normal activities. 
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just before we close our session, I'd also like to express a special word of appreciation to the authorities in Belgium who have facilitated this process.  Thank you very much. 

If there's no further business -- 
MS. BERNARDO-MENDEZ:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You're welcome. 
If there's no further business, I now adjourn until tomorrow morning at 8:45.  
(Court adjourned at 1618H)
